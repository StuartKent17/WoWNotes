<br />
Hello again! I’m Senior Art Director Chris Robinson, and today we wanted to give you a super quick look at our current progress with the new female Draenei.<br />
<br />
After the April Fools’ joke we wanted to ensure you weren’t waiting too long to see where we’re at with her actual character model update. Keep in mind that she’s still in-progress, and doesn’t have any animation to pose her body or face.<br />
<br />
Animation is a big factor for the female Draenei specifically, so it’s important to keep it in mind when comparing the two. The original female Draenei has some fairly extreme posing that happens when she’s animated. If you were to see the static model of the original without any posing you’d see that it looks very similar to the new one. With her pose applied her shoulders stretch backward, her pelvis rotates forward, and her chin lowers—causing her head to angle downwards. The curvature in her lower back, and why the head shape looks slightly different, are also due to the new model not having the same posing applied yet. She also looks a lot taller! Ultimately all of those things will be addressed when we animate the new model, they just don’t take place until she’s rigged and sent on to the animation team.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoyed this super quick look at where we’re at right now, and we’ll continuing sharing more in-progress art as we go forward. The next article in the Artcraft series we’re planning is a look at the creation of the Spires of Arak, a new zone coming in Warlords of Draenor. Thanks for stopping by!<br />
<br />
Senior Character Artist Joe Keller did the majority of the work on this revamp, with direction from our Lead Character Artist Tyson Murphy (@tysmurph (https://twitter.com/Tysmurph)), and myself (@artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson)).&lt;!--<br />
<br />
<br />
WoWDB Updated<br />
The team has been hard at work on WoWDB over the past few days, fixing and updating things to work with the new expansion. All the interest has caused a temporary issue with the site, so check back in a little <br />
<br />
<br />
New Character Models - The new character models have been added to the WoWDB Modelviewer. You need to change the Race in the dropdown. There are still some bugs with some of the models and animations, but many of them are working well!<br />
New Items (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-expansion=6) - Item tooltips now show the new stats and correctly scaling percentages for Level 100.<br />
New Achievements (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements?filter-expansion=6) - The new Warlords of Draenor achievements have been added to the database.<br />
New Spells (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells?filter-expansion=6) - The new Warlords of Draenor spells have been added, with most tooltip errors corrected now.<br />

100% agreement here. I know they have some animation and skeletal rigging to do, but I'm hoping that the super-curved twisty-spine of the original is not part of it - or at least is an option that can be toggled for the forever-alones who need every female video-game character to be wank-bait.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I hope they keep that. Without that posture, she'll just be a blue human with horns and a tail. I love everything about the new model except for the shape of the back.</div></div><hr />

You don't get these Pictures easily. They originally have been taken using a Sandbox. While there is no NDA on the Alpha atm - Sandboxes aren't legal at all. Because the Guys from Ownedcore who made it usually do it by changing Stuff in the Client that isn't supposed to be changed. And to get more precise, the Sandbox was again coming out - while the OFFICIAL Alpha has just begun - with NO ONE who is apparently (?) invited being able to log in.<br />
<br />
Edit: Apparently there's even more. The whole Sandbox thing actually was a Contest on Ownedcore too. I don't know if there was a Reward for the winner though, like money. But it didn't even need to have something like that involved. If the guy would just have kept everything to himself, fine. He can try and tell people about it. But they actually had the Sandbox up for download - every Win7 64bit user could've used it to get a glimpse at finished and unfinished Zones. Without Mobs and Quests and stuff. And that even though they aren't invited into Alpha Testing...</div></div><hr />

Look at original female draenei art by Blizzard, the female looks very closely to that. On the other hand, the males are an abomination and need to get a lot more slim and wayyyy less triangle shaped.</div></div><hr />

Looks nice though. But I really want to see her posed and animated. A bit less hips, by the looks of it. But I think the general design of these new models to make them all look tougher and stronger. Perhaps, dare I say it, more savage?<br />
<br />
The reason the images were removed probably has to do with NDA and how illegal it is to make the sandboxes to take the pictures. I don't mind them being removed, there wasn't much to look at anyway.</div></div><hr />

That's more of an embargo than an NDA. NDAs mean you can't reveal facets of something, not that you can't reveal them to specific locations.<br />
<br />
As far as why, I think it has less to do with the program that was being used, than it has to do with the fact that the lighting, environment, and overall feel was vastly different because it's in progress, and they didn't want people freaking out about the quality of the environment in its early phases. They've used the same reasoning previously, and it made sense, since people freaked out about how &quot;bad&quot; it looked or how &quot;unlike the concept&quot; things were coming, despite it clearing being a WIP.<br />
<br />
<br />
People's obsession with the April Fool's joke probably forced them into releasing it ASAP.<br />
Probably would've helped them a bit had they not hyped up the Draenei reveal and then done it as an April Fool's thing. Cause/effect, yo.</div></div><hr />

All the new models have a similar look to the old ones though. Remember, Blizzard said they don't want to make it look so different that the models look completely different and aren't recognizable. And that pattern has continued with this one. More detail etc. :)</div></div><hr />

Doesn't look that different, given soem texture differences, and what seems to be uhm...some &quot;perk&quot; downsized&quot; I like it, never had that much of a complaint witht he old one anyways, the whole spine thingI chalked up to them being of alien origin, so that's how they evolved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My only nitpicks is I reaaaaally wanted their tails longer D: Like tauren length tails, and ones that actually move when the hips move instead of something stagnant. I'm just hoping that they'll increase the tail length after they finish cleaning her up some more, like with the hoof-fur. I was also hoping they'd increase the size of the head tentacles to make them more of like cute hair pieces, but eh, I can live without that if I have to.<br />

All in all, it looks great, just like all the others are :D *specially the tauren, I can't wait for the female tauren! ~squeeeee!~*</div></div><hr />

Actually, they just explained that the way the spine is in the preview, it won't be in the final version. Once animated it will go right back to being broken, by tilting the pelvis foreward and pulling the shoulder back. The only time you'll see a healthy Draenei spine, is when the model is in the neutral pose (or bind pose), as I actually tend to animate it myself.</div></div><hr />

Dare I say, like the April fool model had, just around the start of their hooves would look nice. Perhaps they'll add it though, it's still very early after all.<br />
<br />
I hope they make the faces different enough as well, but that's with all races at this point. I know they're working on it though so here's to hoping. New horns would be epic as well :P</div></div><hr />

The problem is that MMO-C was guessing with the lighting colors and sky. having done a fair amount of modding, I can tell you that lighting colors can give DRASTIC changes to a zone. Blizzard probably felt that MMO-C was probably misrepresenting what the zones will look like to a large enough degree that it shouldn´t be released yet. Also, there were so many missing and temporary models that made it confusing as well. ( mogu statues).</div></div><hr />

The undergarments are really pretty as well :)<br />

The only thing I'm not 100% happy about is the way her curls fall on her chest in that headband hairstyle, I preferred the wilder curls of the old model. But that's really minor.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, I felt that way too. My first reaction upon seeing the screens was &quot;Wtf they're all green and ugly and look the same&quot;, my second reaction was &quot;oh, they're really completely unfinished, no lighting done, lots of placeholders -- not even close of a representation to what it'll look like ingame, stupid or impatient people will be up in arms about how ugly the zones are&quot;. So I think it's good for them to be removed. Let's enjoy seeing the zones when they're actually ready to be seen.</div></div><hr />

I actually hope this isn't true. The posture looks great in the still model. I adored the Draenei, males and females, but I couldn't stand how horribly bent the females were. This looks good. It's still very erect, but not dysfunctionally so.</div></div><hr />

Oh Goodness, seriously? Yeah, I create models and animate too myself, seriously, don't get why they have to do that considering how they've made worgens and taurens.

There's a reason our spines are shaped like they are, it allows us to stay bipedal. Seriously, she looks like a bird, or a girl wearing way too tall high heels and throwing her hips back to stay level. I know they're aliens but c'mon...that back has always been terrifying.</div></div><hr />

Er, trust me, I do not 'fap' to any of this (I'm a girl, and not into girls so yeah), but it's not saying it's wrong, it's saying that looking at the way the spine should be designed, it just looks...painfully weird.<br />
<br />
I mean that spinal curve is actually to further push out the chest and the butt, (if you notice, the original has her breasts pushed out further and perkier, while the 'natural' style spine actually looks like a normal chest).<br />
<br />
I'm not against creative anatomy, I mean, I play a tauren, a worgen, and a panda (and a troll), but that curve really looks like she shouldn't be able to walk properly. I grant you they're aliens, but seriously, it doesn't look like they should be able to properly walk.<br />
<br />
In a human, such a spine would be akinned to Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Distrophy or Lumbar Lordosis (or sway back. You can also find the 'Lordosis Pose' which is considered the &quot;The seductive female gesture in which the Lumbar Lordosis is exaggerated to accentuate the buttocks, and the head is turned invitingly back toward the viewer, has been called the “Lordosis Pose”.&quot; )<br />

<br />
Actually, Draenei females do make sense with the spine bent like that.<br />
Incoming wall of text, feel free to skip it if you don't feel like reading boring theory nonsense.<br />
<br />
You seem to forget that Humans aren't the only bipeds, and while our straight legs make a mostly straight spine the most effective design choice for our own biology, Draenei don't have straight legs, they have digitigrade (Much like a lot of walking bird species do, that you ironically compared them to)<br />
<br />
In fact, one of the FASTEST bipeds on the planet, the Ostrich, has more in common with a Draenei female's specific leg and spine set-up than we do, and they seem to have no problems keeping balance.<br />
<br />
Plus, they're aliens.<br />
You seem to be of the &quot;They're aliens, but if something on their body defies human biology, that means it's impossible to work&quot; crowd, yet fail to look at other aspects of nature where such biological forms (Or those similar) DO work. Hell, if EVERYTHING followed human logic with it's biology, mammals wouldn't be able to lay eggs. And for the longest time that was widely accepted. But sure enough, here come a big &quot;Fuck your science, you feeble minded humans aren't as smart as you think you are&quot; from nature in the form of a platypus.<br />
<br />
If an Ostrich, with it's highly bent spine, body that on the surface looks like it's too big for it's legs, and overall hilarious form can run at speeds up to 43 miles per hour...AND taste good, it's not unbelievable to think Draenei females can move comfortably with a similar, however less drastic, set-up, and even thicker legs that look like they make up most of her weight and thrust back shoulders to act as ballast, something your typical ostrich lacks.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day Draenei women are more like an ostrich than a human from a locomotion perspective.<br />
Sexy, goat horned ostriches.<br />
<br />
And before anyone says &quot;But the Tauren stand more upright! Why can't they!'<br />
Short answer: Tauren are also a lot heavier and have much, much larger hooves and considerably thicker and more muscular legs to keep balance on. Male Draenei walk upright just fine due to their hooves and legs being larger than females as well, and the fact that their tails are a lot larger and more appropriate for keeping balance, especially considering they can actually control how the thing moves, where as the females typically can't. Sexual dimorphism probably split the male and female Draenei up at some point in their evolutionary history when it deemed the lighter framed females wouldn't benefit from the big muscular tail as much as the considerably larger and heavy refrigerator men would, hence the much shorter, thinner, limp tail that Blizzard says is for balance, but too small and insignificant to do so.<br />
And that's why Draenei ladies more than likely have a cute little tail where as the males have a big plated thing.<br />
<br />
Granted, that's all theory on my end, but to just say &quot;It shouldn't be possible for them to look like this in my fantasy setting because humans don't look like this&quot; is silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try walking like them (use your tip toes as hind legs) without curving your back. They aren't humans, so it's not incorrect or a &quot;spinal disorder&quot; for them not to have human anatomy. I've done Draenei cosplay, and it is very difficult to walk like them without curving your back; it helps you keep balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact, one of the FASTEST bipeds on the planet, the Ostrich, has more in common with a Draenei female's specific leg and spine set-up than we do, and they seem to have no problems keeping balance.<br />
<br />
Plus, they're aliens.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously? You're gonna go with ostriches?...OKaaaaaay<br />
<br />
Lets take a look on ostrich skeletons.<br />
<br />
Like the bipedal world of birds, their skeletons are mostly perpendicular to the ground to the point of their neck, at their neck, they THEN turn upwards, much like a raptor. With that kind of skeleton, they should be with their torsos bent at the hips, with their tails straight out, and then their heads flipped up, along with a keel bone.<br />
<br />
Basically:<br />
0____.___<br />

^ Draenei. Since they don't have the long necks of birds.<br />
<br />
I agree that yes they are an alien, but let's take another creature that's very similar, Succubi. The succubi of the WoW-universe actually have a very similar look, though she shoves her hips forwards, and I always wonder why she doesn't fall backwards (must be those wings.)<br />
<br />
Look, lets take a look at someone who actually has MADE something to act like the 'goat-leg' hooves. Look up the Weta legs. You'll usually find a woman in the cool legs designed to make those same 'faun/saytr/goat' legs. And yet this woman must stand straight to stay properly moving.<br />
<br />
Now I grant you, she doesn't have a tail, but this is taking the form of a humanoid and giving them the 'goat legs', disproving the need for the lobrosis pose.<br />
<br />
It seems more of a personal choice by the creators to give her that 'pushed out chest and butt' look, rather than actual work of the spine.</div></div><hr />

LOL they're precisely where they intend to be with the expansion. They know exactly how much money they'll continue to get from the &quot;hardcore&quot; community who pvp as well the people farming H-SoO for their alts at this point. Don't forget you need an active subscription to play the Beta, and even those people who don't get in will continue to maintain their sub, simply because not having it active would a) feel uncomfortable (habitual behavior) and b) many of them are set in 6 month+ subscription cycles. In short - they have your money and you can't do squat about it.<br />
<br />
Besides, they had to spend time developing hearthstone and working on heroes of the storm to get more of that sweet, sweet micro-transaction money (more to come boys and girls). Plus, with ESO and Wildstar shortly they do NOT need or want any hype competing with their game. They're more than happy to let people try the new synthetic drug of choice and get an itch for the old classic. It's not like WoW has lost it's appeal, especially with the changes they're making.<br />
<br />
So, believe me, a multi-billion dollar company, which is owned by an even bigger multi-billion dollar company, has their strategies well thought out in advance, and an army of market analysts providing them with insight into the best move to make. It's not nice, and we don't like it, but the gaming community has become a rather self-entitled, instant gratification-oriented lot over the past few years anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The model looks definitely a little higher poly, but I think I'll like the old one more. Hopefully the rigged final result will look better.<br />
I also hope they'll remake the female Worgen model. That thing was an abomination since day 1. A severe disappointment after the initial drafts looked quite promising.<br />
The smaller boobs? Are we looking at the same picture? Her boobs look bigger really.<br />
Anyway, on topic. Improvement on the original model, despite what people may say about her posture, she's not human so other laws apply.<br />
I would like to see an actual iris though. Gives way more character.</div></div><hr />

I think its very well done, I like that improved muscle definition, both on the limbs, front and her across her back. They're not quite as spindly overall and the breasts are more naturally positions and shaped. It's a great straight improvement.<br />
<br />
They're animation skeleton hasn't been attached yet, so the posture and body position will not be like the final product (they may still retain the curvature of the spine, which is due to their digitigrade legs) Can't wait to see them rigged and animated (to see what they're REALLY like)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the animation fluidity and expressiveness will invoke the most change on the draenai model. She'll be more emotive and expressive with flowing dynamic movements.</div></div><hr />

It's not a stance against Blizzard; it's a stance that points out &quot;free advertising&quot; was there for the reaping.. until Blizzard themselves pulled the plug. It's always been said that 'any press is good press.' Thus, I find it mind-boggling, especially given their direct lack of creating an NDA before Alpha was implemented, that they would choose to do this. Why not let it be, and reap the free advertising/soak in some constructive feedback.. which they always claim they scour the official forums and fansites (such as MMO-C) in order to find.. and make use of it?</div></div><hr />

Eh, it's basically how I wanted the remodels to go, it's (almost) just an HD version of her,<br />
A lot of the other models they've released (to me) seem too different from the original, seeming even more cartoony than before,<br />
I kinda miss the curved back / chest however, as it made them appear a little bit more like a sexy alien than the standard humanoid model.</div></div><hr />

I've very hazy memories of this happening before.. ie a client gets released, the zones are shown and then Blizzard ask them to be taken down. Perhaps it's an intentional hype fire stoking technique and they know the beta will drop any day now that's got much better zones in it. But it's a strange one really because personally I wasn't all that impressed with what I saw.

Apparently screenshots of zones aren't. Then again, I kinda-sorta remember this happening from time to time with other early testing phases with needing to pull screenshots, so I kinda wonder if it's not an official NDA but more they prefer stuff being a bit more done before it's posted. But if that's the case, they could just put an actual NDA on the screenshots(which I'd assume MMO champ would know about if they had one, which leads me to believe there isn't a full on NDA in place over screenshots but more a preference.) NDAs can be for certain things and not others(like here, they seem to be allowing mounts, beasts/enemies, pets, armor, weapons, icons and mechanical changes, but not zone shots/dungeons/raids screenies.)</div></div><hr />

Some light tweaks here and there, some more muscle definition etc. Leave the face mostly the same, keep it as true to the original as possible. I always thought the Draenei, even if they stem from TBC, don't need nearly as much tweaking as the classic race models do. Anxious to see the male model, and their animations. Liking what i see thus far. :)</div></div><hr />

I dunno. As a boob-havin' bra-wearer, they don't really look that natural to me. Looks like they're either fake or in a very binding bra (possibly a push-up bra), judging by the cleavage created.<br />
<br />
Such a poor choice for a bra though. Those would be spilling out in no time with all the action a fighter does. A strapped bra would be a better fit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not really no,<br />

This picture will illustrate fine how close to the rectum and anal canal the coccyx is and how low our tail would have been.<br />
<br />
To be fair, it's been quite a while since we've had tails. Evolution could have changed the positioning of our coccyx, especially since we became a creature that walks upright. I'm certainly no expert in that area, so I'm just throwing out possibilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Er, trust me, I do not 'fap' to any of this (I'm a girl, and not into girls so yeah), but it's not saying it's wrong, it's saying that looking at the way the spine should be designed, it just looks...painfully weird.<br />
<br />
I mean that spinal curve is actually to further push out the chest and the butt, (if you notice, the original has her breasts pushed out further and perkier, while the 'natural' style spine actually looks like a normal chest).<br />
<br />
I'm not against creative anatomy, I mean, I play a tauren, a worgen, and a panda (and a troll), but that curve really looks like she shouldn't be able to walk properly. I grant you they're aliens, but seriously, it doesn't look like they should be able to properly walk.<br />
<br />
In a human, such a spine would be akinned to Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Distrophy or Lumbar Lordosis (or sway back. You can also find the 'Lordosis Pose' which is considered the &quot;The seductive female gesture in which the Lumbar Lordosis is exaggerated to accentuate the buttocks, and the head is turned invitingly back toward the viewer, has been called the “Lordosis Pose”.&quot; )<br />
<br />
Trust me, the spine looks ODD in such a hard curve. Look up those two spinal issues.<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone is arguing that it would work in real life, but many of us feel that this is the way the Draenei should look like. The pose doesn't look weird to me, it simply looks really good. Same with their movement. I love it. It's playfull and cool, and I find it fitting. I'm a woman who is not into other women either, so it's not my gender talking either. I just like the draenei pose. I like variations in poses. I like the angle of the undead too. People argue about that aswell, and the orc hunch.<br />
<br />
If the original pose was removed, I would feel my Draenei would lose something, and look more like an ordinary human. I don't like the human pose on other races than those who has a typical human skin colour. If I see something with green, blue, or whatever other colour, of it's skin, and it has a human pose(when close to a human figure), it gets dull and uninteresting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
agreed;<br />
<br />
don't like it, there are plenty of other races; the whole point of this, and it taking so long ... was to keep them mostly the same, correct? so people didn't feel a disconnect when it went live, right?<br />
<br />
Well, I think if they did something as drastic as a posture change, they wouldn't need to just give a free re-customization, but a free race change option.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also think the dimorphism argument is quite weak, since, most of the people you meet irl, are quite that way. There is no reason for androgynous neutral postured races and genders to be the norm in fantasy games. Variety is the spice of life; and more realistic.<br />

this person gets it; you are attached to your toon you've had for years; it would lose something, its flavor, character.<br />
<br />
I've also known girls who had this very posture. Was good friends with one. Shoulders back, boobs stuck out, and her butt stuck out. It actually doesn't look unnatural at all to me because of this. The poster relating it to muscular distrophy is being quite exaggerative, maybe I'm seeing it less curved than it is, maybe they are seeing it more; maybe I just knew someone who really knew how to stick out their butt and boobs and walk comfortably :p</div></div><hr />

Supposedly cloaks are more flowing now, rather than the soft flexible cardboard we have now. but don't quote me on this.<br />

We'll see the animations sometime I guess. With the dynamic movement and flowing animation, the /swagger and /waggle of the female draenai will be brought to new heights.<br />

All that curves gave female draenei a somehow majestic presence and let them look more feminine than any other race.<br />

The new model is ridicolous! Stretched flat face and missing curves at the spine ( what flattens hips, breast and ass ), not to mention the slight hanging ass, are a huge Step back.<br />
