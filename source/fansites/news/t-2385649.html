<br />
I'm not sure. There's a massive divide in the amount of work you do for those factions. Thorium Brotherhood takes one or two runs of Molten Core or 300g on the AH to complete, compared to Frostwolves requiring you to park in a corner of Frostfire Ridge and grind trivial mobs for several hours. Molten Core also wouldn't have you competing for mobs when everyone inevitably rushes to unlock them, which would make Frostwolves take even longer to complete in comparison.<br />
<br />
I'd like to think that Blizzard is smart enough to not open up the &quot;[faction a] gets a race for no effort, why does [faction b] have to put in so much effort?&quot; can of worms. Of course, we won't know 'til we get more info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. I KNEW this would happen the moment we discovered Kul Tirans would be an Allied race.<br />
<br />
The entire starting part of the expansion is Horde helping Zandalarians and Alliance helping Kul'Tirans, it only makes sense.<br />
<br />
Then we break off and request help from Orcs and Alliance from Dwarves (which is the race Orcs play when they go Merc mode on BGs btw and vice versa)<br />

Not all alliance. Just the vocal minority. Most of us realised that we just needed to be patient.<br />

How in their right mind can that corehound model be cool. I know its static at this moment. But why did they not make a Ram that looked like that. pfff atleast the paladin mounts look cool.<br />

<br />
Way i look at it - neither have ties to Legion or the known story of BFA and we have now seen pretty much all features of both except classes/racials. <br />
<br />
Perfect time to bring them in story wise would be after the battle of Teldrasil (prepatch) and before Battle of Loraedron (launch) as each faction looks to gain more allies due to the escalation. <br />
<br />
If prepatch is out a month in advance like normal, also gives players a chance to level them before BFA officially launches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say it has to do with the environment which dictates the type of mount a race gets. I don't think the Dark Iron have any Rams stuffed deep within or even around Blackrock Mountain but it's not like I've ever seen these either so maybe I'm wrong.<br />

<br />
How in their right mind can that corehound model be cool. I know its static at this moment. But why did they not make a Ram that looked like that. pfff atleast the paladin mounts look cool.<br />
<br />
I know some people will hate me for saying that. <br />
But really how does this look cool? It has weird proportions.<br />
<br />
I totally aggree. Dwarfs +rams = love forever no matter what. Besides , this isn't a corehound. Somehow it seems that the design is similar with the Zandalari feral form which i also dislike. And seriously why not a fiery ram ? Or a ram covered with heavy steel armor. Hope the model designers come to their senses<br />
If not i 'll make a pala (everyone will ofc ) and ride those awsome rams</div></div><hr />

Now the following races have their unique, up-to-date class mounts:<br />
- Tauren<br />
- Draenei<br />
- Dwarves<br />
- DI Dwarves<br />
<br />
It would be about time they also updated:<br />
- Human Charger<br />
- BE Charger (give them a holy chicken! :P)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, the pigmen are kinda scary, but you know what? I hope they have voice-overs of the real pigs(like squealing):<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baskev</div><div class="date">2018-03-23, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say it has to do with the environment which dictates the type of mount a race gets. I don't think the Dark Iron have any Rams stuffed deep within or even around Blackrock Mountain but it's not like I've ever seen these either so maybe I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lore is what blizzard makes it out to be. I have never seen them. But they will make it up :D.<br />
And i think it has more with race + environment . <br />
But still does not make them better &quot;looking&quot; .<br />
<br />
And i must be-honest.<br />
The dislike comes from a long line of very disappointing allied race crap from BFA...A LONG LINE!!<br />
Its like all the effort is going into the horde. We get recolors of races ( void elves), transferred texture's and say that we have a new druid bear form ( kul tiran druid form has current artifact feral skin), mounts that are either the same we have or cut in half ( in this case). And instead of giving us cool, lore wise, look wise ( how armor etc fits on them) etc etc kul tiran humans. We get our version of hunched orcs...<br />
<br />
All while seeing the horde get what they want each and everytime: Upright male trolls okay, zandalari trolls okay and here is some new forms ( like really new forms), what you guys do not like upright orcs...here upright orcs and lets give you those dreanor race orcs ( brown orcs etc) you wanted all this time to. Ahhh while we are at it lets piss of the alliance players who wanted high elves since they played early rts warcraft by giving blood elves new color eye's just to piss them off even more.<br />
<br />
So please take away some of the hate for the mount. I would have said cool if it was not so blehh right now for the alliance allied races.</div></div><hr />
