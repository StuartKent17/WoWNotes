hatiHati Returns with New Customization<br />
Hunters will be reuniting with their favorite wolf from Legion in Patch 8.1.5. On top of this, Hati is receiving a plethora of different customization items!<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 120 hunters can start the quest chain by heading to their BfA faction hub and talking to the Image of Mimiron.<br />
You can do the quest on any spec, but Hati is only usable by Beast Master hunters.<br />
The quest involves you working with Mirmiron, Grif Wildheart, and Thorim to reconnect with Hati's essence. You will travel to locations such as Storm Peaks, Siluthus, and Ulduar.<br />
Once completed, you will be able to tame 6 different variations of Hati (the original 5 models from Legion and one new color)<br />
The PTR did not limit you on which models you could tame based on what you unlocked in Legion, so it seems that any hunter who completes the quest gets access to all of them.<br />
After completing the quest, you also have access to certain items that benefit Hati, such as making him into a mount!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Charged Sparkstone (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/167800-charged-sparkstone) - Use: Bring out the latent power in Hati's lightning, visually enhancing Hati's abilities. (60 sec cooldown)<br />
Ironspine Protocol (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/167799-ironspine-protocol) - Use: Enhance Hati's size and constitution, allowing mounting. (60 sec cooldown)<br />
Jolt Jerky (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/167797-jolt-jerky) - Use: Feed Hati a special treat, healing a small amount of damage. Sometimes, Hati may become too excited and viciously lick your face, dealing Nature damage. (60 sec cooldown)<br />

cycleCycle of Life Tortollan Quest<br />
An interesting new world quest has been added to the Tortollan lineup called the Cycle of Life. <br />
<br />
<br />
It takes place with Scrollsage Nola (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/134344-scrollsage-nola) and can spawn anywhere that the baby turtle quest Beachhead resides.<br />
This quest is very different from helping baby turtles to the water. Upon reaching it, Nola will tell you &quot;These tiny crabs need help! I hate to see any living things suffer. Would you be willing to lend a hand?&quot;<br />
You then take control of a crab and must move left or right in order to block baby turtles from reaching the water whilst avoiding the orb attacks from Scroll of Blasting (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/292149-scroll-of-blasting).<br />
After blocking a baby turtle, its shell will appear on your head and you can use Throw Turtle Shell (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/292287-throw-turtle-shell) to take out any baby turtles in a line up the beach.<br />
The quest ends when you block 20 baby turtles from the water. Nola exclaims &quot;All creatures in nature must live together in balance. But I can't help cheering for the little turtles!&quot;<br />

dmfDarkmoon Faire Roller Coaster<br />
The Darkmoon Faire Roller Coaster functions much like the carousel, giving you the WHEE! (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/46668-whee) buff after riding it. It costs one Darkmoon Ride Ticket (https://www.wowdb.com/items/81055-darkmoon-ride-ticket).<br />

Darkmoon Faire Severed Fish Heads<br />
Vanion (http://www.vanion.eu/news/patch-8-1-5-witzige-fische-auf-dem-dunkelmond-jahrmarkt-19841) discovered that Severed Fish Heads can be fished up from the waters around the Darkmoon Faire. There are two types of fish heads, Severed Crimsonscale Head (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/164972-severed-crimsonscale-head) and Severed Azurefin Head (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/164973-severed-azurefin-head). They last for one day in your bags and when clicked provide a 60 minute buff that places the fish head on your character!<br />
<br />
The tooltip reads &quot;Something strange is happening in the waters surrounding Darkmoon Island...&quot; perhaps hinting at the speculated relationship between the Darkmoon Faire and Old Gods. In the Warbringers: Azshara cinematic (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7924-Warbringers-Azshara?page=8), N'zoth first appears to Azshara as a fish.<br />

Pretty damn fucking low. Just look at how completely dead this website have become. If they don't give back abilities and character power in the next expansion, I will simply not return this time. Sad cause it's hard to let this go after over a decade. I have no idea what game could replace this, but think I'm done with the mmo genre. <br />
I do pray that they will understand how important your character is. Content doesn't mean shit if your character feels sluggish and gear is boring.</div></div><hr />

Not really sure what you find so humorous about a legitimate question. I am curious as they went and made those tokens from Islands to be ilvl 282 at 120. It also will make a difference with how much gear you'll need to get into heroics as soon as you ding. So, yeah, not really seeing the humor.</div></div><hr />

Did you even pay attention to how much is happening? Sure, maybe if we were getting only Allied Races it would be an hour, but there’s 3 major graphical overhauls happening just to be name 1 reason we have extended maintenance.</div></div><hr />

A lot more happened in prior patches and expansions that didn't require 8+ hours of servers being completely offline, so I find your argument a bit dubious.<br />
Especially considering the majority of that content was either already in game and simply not unlocked, or has already been added into the game files by background downloads over the last day or two.... so we're talking about back-end switches being flipped on their end to enable content already on our machines.... still failing to see why that requires a full day of downtime.</div></div><hr />

Yep, Patch 2.2.0: &quot;Voice Chat!&quot; was a damn good raid patch. Best of BC, maybe.<br />

<br />
Not everything is in the background downloaded. Even if they are in the files, there’s still updates that must be done for the graphical enhancements, and those always take time as well as making sure software is compatible during and after the upgrade process.<br />
Again, if it was just allied races being opened then maintenance would have probably been 30 minutes to an hour, but when you add on changes in visual display as well as multiple cases of instanced content that link between existing and future software profiles, it takes time. Also, 3pm is the estimate. It might be up sooner or even take longer.<br />
Hell, at my work when they update our system with new versions there’s times we spend 2-4 days at a different building due to software changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We haven't had any real downtime in months. They are probably using this as an opportunity to perform some additional hardware maintenance that can only be done while servers are down (upgrades and replacements).<br />
<br />
Also, 8 hours is hardly &quot;a full day of downtime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Edit: And it's up already, anyway. Four hours early.</div></div><hr />

Oh, yes, they did. This kind of thing has been happening for years. In fact, it wasn't so long ago that this was the maintenance schedule every Tuesday, not just patch day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kul Tiran Human and Zandalari Troll Allied Races - Meh takes way to long to level these days with the past XP increase, it's not fun doing the same class from 1-120 the 3-4th time (who doesn't have &gt;20-30 alts by this time)<br />
War Campaign Continues - Ah a few quests with a pointless horde vs alliance story, meh such content<br />
Warlords of Draenor Timewalking - decent addition, but don't really find timewalking fun to PUG.<br />
Professions - Tools of the Trade Quests - Utter garbage for most proffs.<br />
Brawler's Guild Returns - ok addition<br />
New Raiding with Leashes Pet Achievement - wow a whole new achievement, such content, and its even for the exciting pet battles (irony might be present)<br />
New Micro Holidays - Free T-Shirt Day and Luminous Luminaries - Probably forget to log in those specific days, since there is nothing worth doing anymore, so why log in daily.<br />
New Main Hub Portal Rooms - Thanks, you just made doing old content, that more of a waste of time, at least create a portal room that has all the old portals, instead of this junk.<br />
Island Expedition BoA Gear Tokens - Why would i waste tokens on that junk for one time use items, which are also really low ilvl.<br />
Arathi Basin and Warsong Gulch Remastered - don't PVP, so couldn't care less.<br />
New Brawl - Comp Stomp - don't PVP, so couldn't care less.<br />
Hati Returns with New Customization - decent content, hati shouldn't have been removed in the first pllace, so not really &quot;adding&quot; much new content as such are we.<br />
Heirloom Upgrades and Cost - Low ilvl heirlooms, the last time i went all in on heirloom gear, then you increased the lvling time 2x / reduced the effects from the heirlooms / made stuff take alot longer to kill, thanks alot, not falling for that again, esp. not with these stupid gold prices.<br />
Darkmoon Faire Additions - Wow a roller-coaster, that does the exact same thing as the existing carousel, such content.<br />
<br />
The 2 boss raid better to effing good to make up for this huge disappointing patch, probably going back to just raid logging, that is literally the only thing keeping me from unsubbing, its hard enough to get enough people to raid on the non high pop servers as is.</div></div><hr />
