Update 05:45 CEST - Added http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Update on Shadowflame and Haunt (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/10971857611-update-on-shadowflame-and-haunt.html) and an update to http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Upcoming Shaman Changes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/10952075297-upcoming-shaman-changes.html)<br />
<br />
WotLK Beta Build - 9061<br />
Below are all the class changes for this build.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Ebon Plague now increases damage done by diseases by 30%. (Down from 60%)<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
The threat value of Growl (Rank 9 - Level 80) has been increased from 800 to 1234. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=670) / Talent Calc. (9061) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?mage))<br />
Amplify Magic bonus to heal effects has been reduced. (480 to 255 for Rank 7, 240 to 128 for Rank 6, etc ...)<br />
Dampen Magic malus to heal effects has been reduced. (480 to 255 for Rank 7, 240 to 128 for Rank 6, etc ...)<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/paladin.jpg Upcoming Paladin Changes<br />
Righteous Defense -- cooldown lowered to 8 sec. It had been 10 sec recently and is 15 sec on live.<br />
<br />
Infusion of Light -- now affects Flash of Light or Holy Light. Flash of Light is reduced to 0 cast time with 2 ranks, meaning that if you're running around and get a Holy Shock crit, you can also Flash without stopping.<br />
<br />
Judgements of the Pure -- haste benefit now up to 15% with 5 ranks (was 10%).<br />
<br />
Enlightened Judgements -- range benefit is now 30 yards with 2 ranks (was 20). This means you can judge or heal from the same range without having to run around so much.<br />
<br />
Bacon of Light -- no change here, but I can never miss an opportunity to call it Bacon. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warlock.jpg Update on Shadowflame and Haunt<br />
Shadowflame -- We ultimately decided to keep the cone and the dot component, but just the damage. We compared Shadowflame's damage to Cone of Cold, but the latter benefits from a pretty sweet talent and is arguably a little weak-feeling without the talent. Shadowflame has no equivalent talent, so we buffed its damage by about 75%.<br />
<br />
Haunt -- In order to give you a wider window in which to renew the spell, we lowered the cooldown to 8 sec. Refreshing Haunt will also trigger the heal from the existing Haunt, so clipping your previous one won't be as big a problem. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/priest.jpg Devouring Plague Changes<br />
We increased the damage coefficient of Devouring Plague to be similar to other damage over time spells. We also lowered the base damage on ranks 7, 8, and 9 to partially compensate for better scaling.<br />
<br />
Overall this will unquestionably be a buff to the spell's damage, but I wanted to state this clearly lest you just see the base damage in a future build and think we nerfed it. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/shaman.jpg Upcoming Shaman Changes - Update<br />
Update on Lava Burst.<br />
<br />
We ended up buffing the damage by about 10%. You should now have a lot motivation to use it and Flame Shock once you hit level 75. Lightning Bolt isn't going anywhere so you still have your old standby, particularly for 3.0.2 and until you gain a few levels. <br />
<br />
<br />
Raidcomp<br />
While we wait for the patch, it might be a good time to talk a little about Raidcomp (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/). More on that on front page when I'll be sure that it doesn't crash anything on the servers. <br />
<br />
Short description<br />
Raid composition is an important aspect of WoW PvE. RaidComp (from now on denoted as RC) aims to be to raid compositions what talent calculators are to talent specs; allowing everyone to play around with and share different raid compositions online. RC also helps raid leaders by giving an overview of the different buff and debuff categories. It won't do all the thinking for you, raid optimization is complex, however it should be able to do most of the grunt work and highlight some of the categories and abilities you need to look closer at. For example here you have Last Resort (http://www.lrguild.org)'s regular setups for M'uru (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/?c=779o5ehud6oirrroibbr5skkn000000000000000) and KJ (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/?c=7795ourh66oirdriodbrnskkf000000000000000).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Understandable, but to be honest, a tree doesn't necessarily mean anything for Death Knights, which is why they'd really need six categories (blame Blizzard's &quot;any tree for tanking or DPS!&quot; ideal :P). Although, at this point, I don't think you'd really see many Blood tanks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sunsmoon</div><div class="date">2008-10-08, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">buffing pallys instead of nerfing them? this is some god damned bs<br />
This might come to a surprise to you, but there are three different specs for Paladins, and all three have vastly different roles.<br />
<br />
The one pegged as &quot;OP&quot; that needs to be rebalanced would be Retribution, the DPS tree of the class. The buffs were strictly two Protection (Tanking) and Holy (Healing/Support), both of which have needed a bit of extra tuning/buffing. Expect a Ret nerf eventually, but don't cry because skills and talents used ONLY by tanks and healers are getting buffed.<br />
<br />

Only issue I notice is that you list Feral as tank and not melee dps. As a very well skilled PvE kitty, I find slight offense to this. Maybe add Feral Tank and Feral DPS choices.<br />

It is a waste for a holy paladin too. They need to get crit talents from the ret tree. A retribution paladin should be used for it. He does not have to sacrifice anything important.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Various other buffs/debuffs could include Heart Strike preventing haste effects, Hysteria increasing physical damage of a friendly by 20%, Mark of Blood healing target of enemy, etc.</div></div><hr />

Was anybody able to get it shorter than 11 players?<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
<br />
Would also be interesting to know what the smallest number of people required to brings buffs would be assuming raid requirements - ie:<br />

7x Healers<br />
2x Replenishment Providers</div></div><hr />

However the whole idea of &quot;take whoever you want&quot; will not work for 10 mans. My &quot;perfect&quot; group to cower all buffs and debuffs (with exception of casting slow - any boss is most likely immune isn't?) would have: Ret, Prot and Holy Pala, Feral and Balance Druid, Disc Priest, Ench and Elemental Shammy, Frost Mage and Arms Warrior (1/2 tanks, 3/4 melee dps, 3 ranged dps, 2 healers).<br />

Yes that 7 of 10 slots for hybrids and you really miss only Imp. Mana Spring and Mana Tide:<br />

I would say Paladins have guaranteed slots in any raid thanks to imp. auras, blessings and jow/jol. I cannot see any raid not taking at least 2 if they could.<br />
<br />
On the other side that also means in 25 man you will have 15 spots left for 5 healers and 10 dps and it will most likely not matter that much who you take, I could think of one Resto Shammy and maybe 2-3 DK for their funny auras.</div></div><hr />

If you were looking for a healer heavier group (2 tanks, 3 healers, 5dps) you could also go along the lines of: <br />

You keep forgetting Prot Paladins which bring Imp. Dev aura and BoS - both great for tanking and both not replaceable (aura bring more armor than stoneskin isn't? and +healing which you do not have also).</div></div><hr />

1) DK is only tank, he can be also dps in all 3 trees, option to choose what role he should perform would be great!<br />

Realy glad they changed that to raid wide...if you did not have a good working shaman in your group..you could get anything...so yea I am seeing 2 minimum shaman's in a raid at a time..one for the casters and one for the melee</div></div><hr />

Would like to see hovering tooltips in more places, where available.<br />
The left column especially, so you can see which buffs those classes give.<br />
<br />
Estimated DPS totals would be interesting as well, so you can see how the groups interact with each other.</div></div><hr />

That's the difficulty of such assumptions. While most players might now want to take it into their normal raid spec as there are some important sacrifices to do, they would take it if none of the other classes/spec that can bring it are present.<br />
It's the same situation with moonkins and iFF, since it's much more practical for Spriests to apply it most wouldn't want to take the talent in 25-man raids. But it's not spec breaking to take it, so if there isn't one, then they would spec it.</div></div><hr />

13 classes to get all the buffs/debuffs green. It's not ideal at all, but you get the most bang for the buck with these 13.<br />
<br />
Destro lock<br />
Demon lock<br />
1 of each paladin<br />
Feral dru<br />
Balance dru<br />
Ele shm<br />
Resto shm<br />
combat rog<br />
holy pst<br />
marks hunter<br />
frost mage<br />
<br />
This gives you 2 tanks, 3 healers, 6 ranged dps, 2 melee, 1 replenish, 2 bl/hero<br />
<br />
The other 12? Fill up with if you need more than 2 tanks, more than 3 healers, and then whatever class does the highest raw dps based on those buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A window that will also cover loot Areas, if we have 3 2h dpsers (DK's, Fury warriors, Ret Paladins) and no 1h dpsers, might be good to know so favoritism could be applied to maybe a rogue for raid leaders. Other areas to look at are the type of armor(plate, leather, etc), and the style of armor(dps, healing, tank)<br />
<br />
I'd also like it if the raidcomp could draw in information from the Armory, for things like when you have an Arms warrior who also spec'd Commanding presence, or a Restokin spec can cover multiple needs as well, all this in addition to the templated &quot;X player who spec'd all talent points in this one tree&quot;</div></div><hr />

A raid usually consists of 25 characters, so you've got 16 spots left for tanks. Should be enough me thinks.</div></div><hr />

Why take Combat Rogue when you can take Arms Warrior that will do also sunders, demo and Imp. CS. Then you also drop Prot Warrior for Prot Pala and gain Blessing of Sanctuary, Imp. Dev aura and 3rd blessing.<br />
<br />
Also why take Fire Mage when Frost Mage will do similar DPS but also with higher survivability and raid mana regeneration from elemental?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Yes my bad. Luckily that does not change anything.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Perhaps a good compromise would be to add it to Protection Paladins as a maybe. They have BoSanct/BoMight as maybe as well. I will take BoK as a Prot Paladin if none of the other Paladins have it.<br />
<br />
<br />
BoK is easiest to get as Ret and PvE spec will most likely have it, for example:<br />

<br />
They are doing the exact thing Blizzard wants to get away from: bringing X class cause of X debuff.<br />
<br />
Some act like it's mandotory now to bring all debuffs and buffs.<br />
<br />
They link their RC where all those special specs are: balance, ret, frost, unholy, arms, elemental, enhancement are in it, but we all know for a fact the majority of the raids will not consists of all the possible specs in the game in the same raid. They'll just form the raid with who signed up/is online or with their friends.<br />
<br />
Too much theorycrafting here thinking a raid guild will have acess to all those specs in a raid on practicly every opportunity.</div></div><hr />

This RC won't change that, but it will change how the guild starts out in WotLK.<br />
A guild will now aim for making a guild with a lot of possibilities of getting full greens all the way down on RC; they will make sure they have the possibility of getting all buffs/debuffs and then they will start taking it more randomly in the daily process, leaving no class/spec out (which is all that blizz is trying to do).<br />

I know that Blizz wants us to be able to bring anybody to raids without being punished. But if I was raid leader and could choose (for this build) between a Warri Tank / DK Tank / Pally Tank, I'd definitely chooose the pally.<br />
