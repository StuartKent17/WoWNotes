Paragon (http://www.paragon-wow.com/) was the first guild in the world to defeat the Lich King in 25-Heroic mode! The 5% buff was used and it definitely confirms that guilds do not need the 10% version to kill him. (As long as they're that good, I guess) <br />
<br />
The Lich King dropped Glorenzelg, High Blade of the Silver-Hand (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50730/glorenzelg-high-blade-of-the-silver-hand/), Archus, Greatstaff of Antonidas (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50731/archus-greatstaff-of-antonidas/), and of course Invincible's Reins (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50818/invincibles-reins/), which makes them the first guild to get the Invincible flying mount! (The mount is a 100% drop from the Lich King in 25-Heroic) <br />

I can predict it already:<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, they had weeks of attempts while our server was unplayable, so whatever.&quot;<br />

I can SERIOUSLY see something along these lines from Ensidia. Which is kind of sad.</div></div><hr />

I am neither guilds fanboi. I do not care who gets first, second or thirty-third. The attitudes that people show towards these guilds is pathetic, to say the least. <br />

Any other stupid questions?<br />
<br />
<br />
You are stupid.<br />
Yes, I do think their roster off ~70 people can crash a server. No... <br />
Maybe their fanboys can? Okay, so you are saying that it's Ensidia's fault cause they are popular and got alot of fans? Erhm...<br />
They did migrate to Paragon's server cause they wanted the SAME condition as them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now a question to you. Do you think it's fair that Ensidia could barely play during their time on Tarren Mill as the server was down 95% off their time there? <br />
<br />
Anyways, a huge gratz to Paragon! Great job!</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure I had nothing to do with Ensidia exploiting Hodir and C'thun and Vashj and Lich King and Mimiron and Eredar Twins.

I didn't have anything to do with the DDOS attack that Ensidia launched on their own server to give themselves an excuse to not organize and carry out alt raids to get the World First Heroic Lich King 25 kill so that their sponsorship could continue uninterrupted, and I didn't have anything to do with Kungen's personal vendetta against Paragon, which was taken so far that he had his entire guild transfer to Paragon's server in preparation to take it down as well.<br />

I didn't have anything to do with the DDOS attack that Ensidia launched on their own server to give themselves an excuse to not organize and carry out alt raids to get the World First Heroic Lich King 25 kill so that their sponsorship could continue uninterrupted, and I didn't have anything to do with Kungen's personal vendetta against Paragon, which was taken so far that he had his entire guild transfer to Paragon's server in preparation to take it down as well.<br />
<br />
I also didn't have anything to do with the fact that Paragon killed Heroic Lich King 25 today.<br />
<br />
<br />
They would be banned and ridiculed. And they have been.<br />
<br />
<br />
Amen to that.<br />
<br />
Ensidia's been a gigantic elephant in the room ever since they came onto the scene as Nihilum (Before they merged with SK gaming and, from what I assumed had the original members leave) and began being the mouth of every wanna-be idiot who wants to pretend that taking the game too seriously while inconveniencing everyone else is great. After they've been losing speed in the whole &quot;race&quot; they decided to cheat and finally got put in their place, which is becoming more and more place-putting since.<br />
<br />
I may be a little biased, but that won't change what they've gotten themselves into.</div></div><hr />

The pressure on their shoulders after they got the kill on Kel Thuzad has been harder and now people are &quot;catching up&quot; to them which makes the pressure even harder. Now they must strive to be the &quot;best&quot; guild and when they dont succed people are laughing at them?<br />

The hate doesn't come because they're &quot;the best&quot;, it's because (like in that interview, for example), they're cocky assholes who think they're the best ever, and everyone else is overrated. Some of their attitudes are outrageous.<br />

Edit: Interesting discovery now.... The Quest Item that was found in the game files seems to not drop from LK 25 HC then? :O<br />

Hopefully this will have changed their opinion in underrating their &quot;opponents&quot;. The competition is not between the guild and the boss.. it's between the guilds and thats quite sad since people do everything just to get the first kill.</div></div><hr />

Shoulder armor will now attach correctly to Blood Elf Male characters.<br />

Nice try. It looks less shitty than when they broke the fuck out of it, but it still attaches to their shoulders about as well as lego does to a burrito. People keep asking for updated character textures. I'd just like a functioning skeleton that doesn't twist like a fucking slinky anytime I do anything.</div></div><hr />

Edit: Didn't Ensidia transfer to Lightning's Blade prior to this kill?! :-o Wooow, they miss out on a &quot;Realm First&quot;, too!?</div></div><hr />

<br />
None. It's not been 1-2 consistent guilds threatening us, so if anything happens it will be another obscure random guild from somewhere nobody has ever heard of. Stars, Paragon, Premonition, etc are all overrated.<br />

I just went by what i read ON THIS SITE, that ensidias mains got locked for a week for cheating. I also state any guild that gets it with out %5 buff is best, which means ya'll can suck each others unused dicks w/ your fucking over used statements. &quot;FANBOI&quot; this is why i hates wow players &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

It looks like the DK is an alt from what I can see.<br />

You didn't read good enough.<br />
<br />
They were banned for 72hrs. They were locked out on their mains, YES, but they used their alt raid to kill normal LK25 the day they were unbanned. They then used one of those alt characters to unlock Heroic ICC25 for everyone else. They started the same week.</div></div><hr />

I never called you that, you were just uninformed, which is cool. Not everyone has the time to read every scrap of meaningless information. Unfortunately, I have nothing better to do...so you win this round. :P<br />
<br />
I agree though. The rampant fanboy claims are just as bad as everyone calling any non-conforming opinion a troll.<br />

No. there has been like 6 people who have already said it. it WAS funny, now it is not.<br />

also wasn't Tarren Mill getting crashed by that fishing macro for like a week? there is a thread on their server forums 130 pages or so long about it. so i guess they missed a few days cause of that :/ meh<br />
