Blue posts<br />
Player vs. Player<br />
Casters vs. Melee<br />
Now there are a lot of concerns about how casters are struggling against melee, but we don't think that is a &quot;burst too good&quot; issue. For the players complaining about Arms and Juggernaut, the issue is not that they get Mortal Striked for 10,000 or whatever. Plenty of casters can get off big nukes, but they aren't the problem du jour according to the forums. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977436-we-dont-think-burst-is-a-problem.html))<br />
<br />
Burst damage in Arenas<br />
Players complained about burst and DKs last season and had every right to. We think both are in a better place now.<br />
<br />
There are definitely some situations where you can get into with a class and die too quickly. There are also situations where CC or healing or dispelling are too dominant. Arena balance isn't perfect and we'll continue to make changes as we go along. However, we don't feel like you can just summarize all of this season as being too bursty (which we do think happened last season before people got enough resilience). If you look at a lot of the complaints coming out of Arenas right now, they are about healing (Disc, Resto druids and various paladin specs at least) and melee (or at least Arms, Unholy, Ret and rogues) vs. casters. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977436-we-dont-think-burst-is-a-problem.html))<br />
<br />
[...] What is even more interesting is you appear to hold as fact or at least widespread consensus that PvP burst is too high, while writing off all the players who disagree with you as dumb too.<br />
<br />
We think burst was too high in the previous season. That was because players were dying quickly before they could even respond or counter. If you go into an Arena match today and die, that does not mean burst is too high. Don't confuse dying and burst. Remember, you are probably going to lose about half your matches. That's the way the matchmaking system works. That doesn't mean the system is broken just because you don't win a lot.<br />
<br />
There are situations in which one class can burst another down too quickly. There are also situations in which crowd control or healing are too dominant. We are trying to clamp those down when they get out of control. But &quot;ZOMGBURST&quot; is so last season. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367757877-revelation-about-ghostcrawler.html))<br />
<br />
Class balances and consequences on PvP representation<br />
My point was that when you change a PvE ability, it usually only affects that class. When you change a PvP ability, it often affects multiple, perhaps all classes.<br />
<br />
The intent I get from some posts is that some players assume that if their class is say 5% low in Arena representation that a simple buff might bring them up 5% and then everything is cool. But when they go up, nearly always other classes go up or down. You can buff a class indirectly by nerfing another one. Happens all the time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977789-pve-vs-pvp-balance.html))<br />
<br />
Resilience<br />
We're not convinced melee stop improving their resilience. Typically that only works for a class with such high CC or defensive potential that they just aren't taking damage much (rogues typically have fallen into this category). Resilience doesn't lower damage -- it lowers burst damage. It means you have to whack at a guy a few times and can't just explode him on contact. It means you have to play smart -- blow cooldowns, use crowd control to minimize defenses, tie up the healer and otherwise cause damage at the right time instead of just causing damage. Remember as a caster, most melee have no inherent defense against you -- their armor does *nothing* versus magic damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977436-we-dont-think-burst-is-a-problem.html))<br />
<br />
Itemization<br />
Balancing around best in slot items<br />
We don't balance just around best in slot because so few players will ever be at that point, and by the time they are, the content is usually on farm for them. You don't need best in slot to make progress in Ulduar and by the time you are halfway through Ulduar you probably have added a lot of Ulduar gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Hybrid classes<br />
Our stance hasn't changed since Lich King. Originally (pre-LK) we tried to keep hybrid specs at 40% or more behind the pure damage-dealers, but then we also treated warriors as pure damage-dealers. If you really know your class, and I mean really know it, and if you have good gear, the right buffs, and a group that backs you up, then you are fully capable of topping the damage meters on certain fights. Overall we do want to make sure the pure dps classes are slightly higher when all things are equal, otherwise there is no point to those entire classes existing. Do warriors beat mages on some fights? Absolutely. What's the issue?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you're getting at with that last part. Ret paladins were not a serious raiding option for many players pre-LK. Now they certainly are. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Death Knights in PvP and Frost Strike<br />
The DK has to have a lot of runic power to use that ability, so they can't unload with it right off the bat the way say a Ret can. Unholy is still far more dominant in PvP, which makes us think this problem is a little overblown. We might remove the dodge and parry prevention from it, which we added to make sure DKs didn't just Deathcoil instead. There are enough talents for Frost Strike now that it's going to be attractive regardless. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977436-we-dont-think-burst-is-a-problem.html))<br />
<br />
[...] Yes, the resource has a ton to do with it. Nobody complains about PoM Pyro (much) because it can be done so infrequently. Frost Strike and Scourge Strike are essentially finishing moves. It's harder to use them as openers.<br />
<br />
Now that's not to say finishing moves can never be unbalanced, but I must admit to being a little surprised at all the focus on DKs. They were without a doubt too good last season, but currently they are below rogues in the brackets that &quot;matter&quot; and far below healers across the board. If I wanted to stack the deck to be succesful in Arena, I would be rolling a Disc priest, not a DK. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977436-we-dont-think-burst-is-a-problem.html))<br />

Arrows drop in instances<br />
Dropping one arrow would be fine. Dropping a stack of 1000 or even 10,000 would be pretty painful, which is what we'd have to do now.<br />
<br />
We do need to be careful how many class-specific items we drop. Yes there are librams and idols and such, but high dps ranged weapons are already of pretty limited interest to other classes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977917-dropping-arrows-in-instances.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
MP5 on Paladin's gear<br />
The issue that started all this was paladins saying &quot;We don't want MP5 on our gear.&quot; The designers designed you assuming you'd have MP5 on your gear -- I know; I was there. If you are effective without having MP5 then it probably means you are going to be too powerful at some point because you are able to replace a less-powerful stat with a more powerful one without missing the loss of the less-powerful one.<br />
<br />
Imagine you could prune every less-useful stat off your gear. Imagine you could trade in armor, Stamina and everything else for just spell power and crit. Do you think you'd blow away the other healers? I do. That's more extreme than giving up MP5 for more crit, but carries similar risks from a game-balance perspective.<br />
<br />
Healers should care about Spirit (druids and priests) and MP5 (paladins and shamans). It's fine to care about Int and crit too, but if you're ignoring Spirit and MP5 and aren't missing them, then something isn't working right.

Titan's Grip passive bonus<br />
That is part of it, yes. All of the active abilities have some kind of cost, even if it's just a GCD. If you weren't spending rage on Mortal Strike or mana on Crusader Strike, you'd be spending it somewhere else. A passive talent that improves dps in almost all situations and requires almost no action or decision on the part of the player is incredibly risky. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html))<br />
<br />
Titan's Grip as a multi-point talent?<br />
The problem with TG as a five-point talent is that it doesn't divide evenly by five. You can't say &quot;Makes you 20% able to wield two two-handers&quot; at rank one. That means inevitably one rank of the talent is worth a lot more than the others and we've had trouble any time talents are structured that way. <br />
<br />
[...] If you were around through beta, we tried that. Not many players liked it. May took a single point in TG and then spent other points elsewhere. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html))<br />
<br />
Titan's Grip nerf<br />
TG isn't nerfed into the ground though. Players occasionally try to show how it's a dps loss, but they have failed every attempt I have seen. If the talent improves your dps by 25% and then the 10% penalty lowers than benefit by 15% (including rage loss) then it's still giving you a 10% dps boost, which is about ten times higher than we shoot for with one talent point. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html))<br />
<br />
[...] The TG nerf took lost rage into account. This was a myth started by warriors who didn't like the change. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html))<br />
<br />
Warrior damage in PVE<br />
Naxx warrior damage was too high. If it is slightly low now (which we think it is), that doesn't make the former untrue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html))<br />

It isn't all bad, because I still enjoy playing deeps on my warrior... and it should be taken into account that warriors are the most gear-dependant class in the game, and not many are very end-gamed out in Ulduar gear yet... but it doesn't seem right.<br />

The problem is that the rest of the tree without TG is about 30% weaker than any other class is before getting the 51 point talent. They need to balance the rest of the tree first to make it work the way they're talking about.</div></div><hr />

counting that 90%of the druids roll resto in arena and THEY already are in the problems as casters u wont see a feral much.same gos for shammys except they are in the same boat as the rest of the casters even as resto.SO THAT LEAVES what other melee class????....... :o (sry guys the mythical melee hunter still needs more representation)<br />
<br />
your right no problem with melee vs caster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that's way too far behind. And I think that DK's, for being a hybrid class, are still way far ahead of Boomkins and Shaman, etc. Unless &quot;Hybrid Class&quot; does not mean tanking/dps, it only means tanking/dps/healing, which is what they seem to be thinking.<br />
<br />
And having a Holy Pally as well, I am getting very nervous about what they are going to do to them. We aren't usually ever on the top of the healing charts, though we do good at the role that we are usually assigned, but I think that Blizz has some major nerfs inc because they don't like how we are gearing ourselves.<br />

Maybe make arrows as single item (with rarity of regular epic instance drop), and it will have f.ex. 1000 durability or something, and hunters will need to repair it (paying price similar to buying stacks of that what we have today)</div></div><hr />

Warriors were 10th of 10 - currently the worst dps'ers in end-game. <br />
It isn't all bad, because I still enjoy playing deeps on my warrior... and it should be taken into account that warriors are the most gear-dependant class in the game, and not many are very end-gamed out in Ulduar gear yet... but it doesn't seem right.<br />

Wrong. http://www.wowmeteronline.com/rank/classrank/7<br />
<br />
The average dps of the top 50 SP parse is dead last for 5 of the 14 bosses. SP are bottom 5 for 10 out of the 14 bosses.<br />
<br />
Among the dps hybrids Ferals and DKs are way above others in dps.<br />
Warriors and SPs need buffs, Shammies and moonkin seem to be the average, Rets either ok or slighty above, DKs and Ferals way above.</div></div><hr />

Arrows drop in instances<br />
Dropping one arrow would be fine. Dropping a stack of 1000 or even 10,000 would be pretty painful, which is what we'd have to do now.<br />
<br />
What? Arrows stack in 1,000 now. What is the difference between one arrow and one stack of arrows? Why would that be &quot;painful&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
He was responding to someone asking for ranged ammunition to be like a thrown weapon -- i.e., in TBC they started dropping Thrown weapons that had a repair status (200/200), which meant you got 200 throws, then you had to repair it to charge it back up. So the poster was saying hey I wouldn't mind running a heroic to get a rechargeable (repairable) arrow for ammunition.<br />
<br />
GC didn't bite since that technology probably is too heedy for re-working ammo, and instead stated this implying it would be painful to have to run a heroic just to re-stock your ammo. Even if it dropped 10,000 arrows, you'd run out in a while, with no way to get them other than re-running the instance.</div></div><hr />

He must've meant Holy Paladin plate gear. Those are REALLY annoying, to be honest. Only one type of spec for one type of class can use them, and most of them are so badly itemized that our Holy Paladin's go &quot;I wouldn't wear that shit&quot;.<br />
<br />
I know it wouldn't look right, aesthetically, but itemization for Holy Palas are really close to Resto Shamans...</div></div><hr />

I have played in several top guilds on my server among really good players, and me being a ret paladin many classes in both guilds have beaten me. In single target dps a ret paladin will never win compared to a GOOD rogue, enhance shammy, or good warrior, but if there are aoe targets a ret pally might always rank top 3 or higher even, cuz a ret paladin has a rotation in which the aoe is included in the single target dps, so he aoe's as he single targets, unlike many casters that would have to channel an aoe, for example mages blizzard, or rogues fan of knives. You cast fan of knives, there goes your energy, we cast consecrate, it keeps ticking as we single target dps and divine storm every time it's up. But seriously, even on Thorim, I barely beat rogues even with all the aoe I have....rogues slaughter me on single target dps fights by quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

What he said. They're hyping up this 'zomg too much dmg from 1 point' but never seem to acknowledge that -without- TG the entire tree is useless. It's already been said that they do NOT want 1h fury to work any more, and unless they go back to single 2h-fury (aka arms) being viable again, titan's grip is -mandatory-.

Really, whenever you see GC making posts about PVP it is clear that he has no clue at all. That´s probably the reason the game is so horribly unbalanced. He should try playing it and maybe he would understand. Then again he would probably play a DK or Retlol and think he got high ratings because he was skilled and not understand the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that can be answered with a simple analysis of source credibility. <br />
<br />
Who is more likely to have the most accurate up-to-date information?<br />
a) The developers who created the underlying math behind the game, have it on access at all times and are the ones who update and change it first? or<br />
b) The players who only see the end result of the math and have to do best estimates/reverse engineering based on numbers from talent calculators, dummies, talent trees and numerous tests? <br />
<br />
I'm more inclined to believe the Devs have a great deal deeper an understanding of the underlying math and numbers behind their own creation than players who have to reverse engineer it to only come up with best estimates <br />
<br />
As I recall it's very rare for the ACTUAL equations to be out there. If I remember correctly it wasn't until maybe last month or so that the official equation for the way Armor Penetration worked was released by a blue post. I think that the player base puts a great deal more faith in the fancy theory-crafter spreadsheets than they really should...so much so that they seem to regard the sheets as a more accurate representation of the game than the [i]game itself[i]</div></div><hr />

Yeah cuz clearly every other class in the game is so hard to play in arena....unless you're talking about BGs where ppl run around in level 80 greens and pve gear and get 4 shot by dks and ret paladins that unload all their cooldowns at once onto someone and auto-crits basically....altho rogues/mages/hunters/warriors do the same....so.....yummy. Retlol is actually teh suckzorz in arena atm, in 2s we are totally useless with a healer, it's like &quot;k, what we have to do to win, is to make the other healer go OOM, over the period of this arena match, then when he has no mana, I kill his ass. OH SHIT IT'S A HOLY PALLY, FUCK ME, HE'LL NEVER GO OOM!&quot; Then we lose automatically, but I rest my case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm referring specifically to the blue response from GC by the paladin whining about MP5 on pally gear. Like...who are you? <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be hostile but imagine this in any other scenario: I'm going to walk up to the slave children of Trashcanistan or wherever sneakers are made and be like. &quot;you know kids...I wear a lot of sneakers and, no offense because I know you spend 16 hours a day making sneakers, but I just think that I myself...with no prior sneaker-making skills education or abilities, understand sneakers a little bit more than you do. Please step up the game, okay? <br />
<br />
I'm going to walk up to Brett Farve and say: &quot;Listen Brett, do you mind if I call you Brett? I watch a lot of football, okay? I see the ball get thrown a lot, and I own many jerseys. I've also thrown a lot of things in my day. I throw stuff all the time. I just think that maybe you can...you know...get a little better at throwing? I know it's your job and you're a professional and I'm just Some Guy, but I really don't think you have a grasp on all the intricate details of Ball Throwing that I possess. I mean when I throw things I really see the ball thrown...like SEE it, you know what I'm saying? Real deep Throwing Understanding and stuff...so if you could just...fix it and get better? See things the correct way that I see it and you don't, that would be great, thanks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Comments like those, and the frequency with which they are made, always astound me...<br />
<br />
In most games and in most cases I'd agree. However, specifically with Paladins it's a bit touchy. Here's a clip from a Blizzcon prior to GC and the current team, and it really does explain why the older Paladin community is very very suspicious about anything the devs do to Paladins.<br />

I'll para-quote &quot;how the class evolved into something beyond our control&quot;. Yup, that's that time's lead developer standing up there saying that a class inside the game evolved in a direction they couldn't control. (I mean, it was physically impossible for them to remove the healing spells if they didn't want the class main healing... right?)<br />
<br />
That said, the current dev team is a lot better. Hell, they made and continually make an effort to fix the Paladins so that they both function properly and are fun to play.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yepp</div><div class="date">2009-05-26, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah cuz clearly every other class in the game is so hard to play in arena....unless you're talking about BGs where ppl run around in level 80 greens and pve gear and get 4 shot by dks and ret paladins that unload all their cooldowns at once onto someone and auto-crits basically....altho rogues/mages/hunters/warriors do the same....so.....yummy. Retlol is actually teh suckzorz in arena atm, in 2s we are totally useless with a healer, it's like &quot;k, what we have to do to win, is to make the other healer go OOM, over the period of this arena match, then when he has no mana, I kill his ass. OH SHIT IT'S A HOLY PALLY, FUCK ME, HE'LL NEVER GO OOM!&quot; Then we lose automatically, but I rest my case.<br />
<br />
<br />
They are much harder to play then DK and Retlol yes. You have infinite mana, you have no micromanagment, you have no cc chains to worry about. All you do is stick on one target. And to be a skilled Retlol you make a macro that casts cleanse on your healer. And in 3vs3 you can play cleave with a warrior or DK and faceroll all you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since TG is a 51 point talent, GC is basically saying that for a 51 point talent, it should only increase your dps by one percent.<br />
<br />
Does this guy even play his own game?</div></div><hr />

Yeah that was pretty disingenuous. 1% dps for 1 talent point is the sort of mark they aim for with regular talents, not the 11/21/31/41/51 point &quot;uber&quot; talents.</div></div><hr />
