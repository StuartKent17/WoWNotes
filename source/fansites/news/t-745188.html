Last but not least, the models of the Tol'virs (Stone-like cat people created by the titans) and the Ramkahens (Descendant of the Tol'vir who lost their &quot;stone&quot; form) are now fully implemented.<br />
<br />

<br />
Tons of variations exists for these models and you will probably see a lot of them around Uldum. <br />

Guild wipe last week on beta servers<br />
We had to wipe guilds on the beta server in regards to a number of bugs that were introduced with the new guild advancement system. The wipe also helps us get the most accurate testing we can with the new system.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the late notice on this, we will do our best to give warning if we need to do it again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262708645/guilds-wiped/))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / 3.3.5 Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin#,,12213) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=.9r8.paladin) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1670-Paladin-Cataclysm))<br />
Protection Paladin (Source (Is Holy Wrath going to have the same model it currently has? As a split damage ability?))<br />
Here is how Prot paladins are working in our current beta build. You might not see these changes in the next beta build, but in the one after that. Things are still in a high degree of flux however.<br />
<br />
Shield of the Righteous -- Now consumes Holy Power to cause damage.<br />
<br />
Holy Shield -- Now a passive ability that causes your Shield of the Righteous to provide 5% block per stack of Holy Power consumed. In other words, you never click Holy Shield. You just click Shield of the Righteous and buff yourself.<br />
<br />
Hammer of the Righteous -- Now generates Holy Power but shares a cooldown with Crusader Strike. Almost all talents that affect one or the other will affect both. The intention is you use Crusader Strike -&gt; Shield of the Righteous for single target and Hammer of the Righteous -&gt; Shield of the Righteous for multitarget.<br />
<br />
Avenger's Shield -- No real change, but it still hits pretty hard. Both CS and HotR can proc Grand Crusader to lower the Avenger's Shield cooldown.<br />
<br />
Vindication -- can be caused only by Crusader Strike or Hammer of the Righteous.<br />
<br />
Holy Wrath -- With the above changes, we think Prot paladins have enough rotational buttons to hit, so we are downplaying Holy Wrath. Holy Wrath is really intended as a Ret filler spell (for when other attacks are on cooldown). Prot could technically use Holy Wrath, but we aren't providing any talent hooks.<br />
<br />
Consecration -- Now on a 10 sec duration with a 30 sec cooldown. The Hallowed Ground talent makes it cheaper and hit harder -- it does not affect duration. Use Consecration when you need it, but you can't spam it. This is consistent with the AE changes we are making to all tanks.<br />
<br />
With these changes in mind, Prot will be thinking about buttons such as these:<br />
<br />
Single Target: Judgement, Crusader Strike, Shield of the Righteous, Avenger's Shield.<br />
Multi-target: Judgement, Consecration, Hammer of the Righteous, Shield of the Righteous, Avenger's Shield, possibly Exorcism.<br />
<br />
None of this includes things like Seals, Inquisition, defensive cooldowns, Word of Glory, etc. <br />
<br />
So with Vindication off of Holy Wrath, is it intended that Prot Paladins are the only tank without an AoE Physical Damage debuff, or will similar changes be made to the Warrior/Druid/DK mechanics?<br />
Hammer of the Righteous will be AoE enough. It hits many targets. It may not be as widespread as Demo Shout on a pull like a jillion Onyxia Whelps, but we don't really expect you to debuff pulls of that size. <br />
<br />
Let me just clarify something - Hammer of the Righteous will generate 1 Holy Power per cast, or 1 Holy Power per target hit?<br />
<br />
One per cast. Otherwise we think paladins might want to always be hitting multiple targets, like &quot;Let me tank the boss and one of the adds or my Holy Power generation will be low.&quot; <br />
<br />
Is Holy Wrath going to have the same model it currently has? As a split damage ability?<br />
Yeah, we like the split damage because it lets Ret (and Prot if needed) use it in most situations. <br />
<br />
Also will 3 stacks of holy power when using shield of the righteousness roughly equal the amount of threat it did before it got removed or is it changed?<br />
It will be a hard-hitting button, especially with 3 stacks. I'd guess your highest damage ability. <br />

No-one else but you actually thinks about it. Maybe it's your mind that's perverted, as you seem to think about it so much? The actual furries don't bring it up, it's all the people &quot;hating&quot; them that constantly bring it up and are an annoyance.</div></div><hr />

You must be new to the internet. This happens with everything here. It's nothing new, move along...<br />

But i want more changes to Blood Tree, still doesnt feel like a &quot;Tank&quot; tree to me. Sure, it has a lot more tanking talents now they have been moved in from Frost and Unholy but it doesnt feel like anything &quot;New &amp; Unique&quot; has been added.</div></div><hr />

One could blame that all the changes done to each and every class is monumental and will change the face of the game as we see it, possibly giving us brand new experiences to observe, and that one small visual niche is invisible in comparison to everything around it. I blame Theralion (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2wEcyo7o-Q) and Valiona (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bbohl_jQVHE&amp;feature=channel).</div></div><hr />

Tho with current build single target seems rather dull, judge of cd, cs till 3 stacks of hpow and shield+ avengers on cd. Thought they were going to make it interesting this is static and wont make a good paladin differ alot from a bad one..<br />

Yes, the rotation looks more than dull. It's asleep-at-the-wheel pants-on-head-retarded boring.<br />
<br />
I've been a Pally tank for a while. I endured Seal-twist and reflective damage.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I can endure falling asleep every fight because we have 1 unique move...which is throwing a damn shield like a comic book super-hero.</div></div><hr />

I strongly dislike Hammer being our &quot;AOE&quot; move. It was my favorite move, and I hate that I'm replacing it with the generic-as-hell Crusader strike for most fights.<br />

A hybrid class is any class that can do more than 1 role out of tank, damage dealer and healer (in the strict sense, not novelty sense). The only classes that are not hybrids are Warlocks, Mages, Hunters and Rogues.</div></div><hr />

If it hasn't been obvious all along, it really should be now, Blizzard is hell bent on destroying aoe tanking on the paladin. They want them to truly suffer for their sins of being the best tank through out two expansions. They have also poured out wrath on the druids because of their sins as the best group healer for two expansions. Welcome to the true meaning of Cataclysm.<br />

they want shield toss to get a cd reset somewhat frequently so i imagine they intend for it to be used more frequently than now for aoe aggro<br />

Tanking 3 mobs in a pack of 20 is NOT aoe tanking.<br />

Seriously, then why bother to have paladin tanks or bear tanks at all if that is the case? Isn't it enough that warriors and dks can face roll their way to the top of the dps charts in almost every fight? There has never been anything wrong with warrior tanking. The only thing about warrior tanking is that if you are newb/casual you can't do it because it requires actual skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For starters, there are way to many newbs going on about how they want to make Jacob or TeamJacob in this game with their Worgen and role play Twilight. That in and of itself is just sad. Also, this game is a fantasy game not a horror game. If you want to play a horror creature in a MMO then demand that someone make a horror MMO (unless one already exists that I don't know of). Keep your horror and your Twilight out of my fantasy. I can't be the only player getting pissed about this. Oh, and Tauren are very loosely based on NA lore and cattle. They aren't a generic copy from somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

The fields were pretty even in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
My guild's other main tank is a warrior tank. He is disgusted with people like you. He's damn near embarrassed to play a Warrior now because all their buffs have made them pants-on-head retarded easy (not that any tank rotation is hard). Now, I wouldn't mind this so much, except that I still see people complaining about it!<br />
<br />
Not tank rotation is hard. Haven't been for quite some time. Warriors aren't different. You aren't special snowflakes. You aren't a unique and irreplaceable gem of a class.<br />

Also the concentration change is also a bullshit change. people bring pallys to their raids because they can keep a constant aoe on the ground. now were the same with a warrior and who will people bring to their raid? the warrior. sounds like blizzard is screwing with stuff that doesn't need changing. That saying if it aint broke don't fix it? They just keep messing with a rotation that wasn't OP or under powered. just right.<br />

The side from Tanaris was locked behind a gate and guarded by giants. Everyone presumed it was an underground complex like Uldaman, so no reason to go poking around from the air. Also, there is a crashed gnomish airplane on the southern beaches of Tanaris, so perhaps there is an anti-air system in place.

Whole zone was covered with tick layer of sand, then one day Mr. Crowley was passing through and bunch of scorpions attacked him, so he had to use fist cleaves to kill those scorpions, but his overpowered cleaves generated so much excessive force which transferred on the air, that all the sand was blown away.</div></div><hr />

The last quarter of this year, like they've been saying. Once there's a release date, trust me, we'll ALL know.<br />

This is fairly standard fare for Blizzard. The expansion will come out when it's done, as do all their games.<br />

<br />
1. Tol'vir have always been mentioned as far as I can remember, and were always a cat like race of people just never seen. <br />
2. Go look at Zul'Gurub<br />
3. Go look at Zul'Aman<br />
4. Worgen were in game already (Werewolf Not furry)<br />
5. Tauren.<br />
<br />
Why must trolls revert to furry the second anything appears to walk like a human but have fur? My god you would think you are playing a fantasy world or something where creatures beyond humanoid might exist ... oh wait. =_= I don't like them but I'm not screaming it every time a new race of any form crops up with fur.<br />

Agreed, WoW has actually always had a pretty strong horror/fantasy element to it: Lovecraftian Old Gods in vanilla, the first Naxxramas in vainilla, demonic possessions and invasions in BC, Lovecraftian old god again in Wrath, Naxxramas again, everything to do with the Lich King and his whole army of undead...

<br />
Crusader Strike deals 100% weapon damage every four seconds.<br />
<br />
Hammer of the Righteous deals 300% weapon damage to its primary target every eight seconds. All talents that affect one, affect either. A 5% increase to crusader strike would therefore cause it to strike for 105% weapon damage, while hammer of the righteous would hit for 315% weapon damage.<br />
<br />
Therefore, assuming no talents, hammer of the righteous strikes its primary target the equivalent of 150% weapon damage every four seconds.<br />
<br />
Why, then, if they are to share a cooldown, would crusader strike ever be used in place of hammer of the righteous?</div></div><hr />

Numbers, they're not finished. (You're going to love this.) It's still beta!<br />

My guild's other main tank is a warrior tank. He is disgusted with people like you. He's damn near embarrassed to play a Warrior now because all their buffs have made them pants-on-head retarded easy (not that any tank rotation is hard). Now, I wouldn't mind this so much, except that I still see people complaining about it!<br />
<br />
Not tank rotation is hard. Haven't been for quite some time. Warriors aren't different. You aren't special snowflakes. You aren't a unique and irreplaceable gem of a class.<br />
<br />
But, whatever. You keep on laying out 14k revenge crits in ICC and telling yourself that you're the victim of the mean ol' OP Paladin tanks.<br />
I'm pretty fucking sure that Cataclysm is still in beta, and not anywhere near complete. But if you were referring to WOTLK, no the tanking classes were not even. Honestly, just shut the fuck up moron you don't know what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
By the way your tank sounds like he needs to be slapped.<br />
<br />
The kind of gap you're describing that existed between so called &quot;SKILL&quot; and being a good warrior tank is actually called &quot;CLUNKY GAME MECHANICS&quot; and it's got alot to do with why it's so fucking hard to find a tank for anything especially one that is not a druid, paladin or dk.<br />
