Warcraft Movie Update<br />
The Hollywood Reporter talked (http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywood-gorilla-warfare-s-universal-823715) about Legendary and Universal today, claiming that sources say Warcraft is seen as &quot;problem movies&quot; by Universal. Duncan Jones isn't worried though! <br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Raids<br />
real talk: LFD and LFR, ultimately, at the end of the day, all is said and done, bad for a game?<br />
I still don't know. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642850460651524096))<br />
If you put a gun to my head I'd say LFG with harder dungeons and no LFR. But it's a crap shoot. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642850635205865472))<br />
Easyish Naxx and LK dungeons set expectations that were hard to ever undo. Maybe LFG was just a symptom at that point. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642850895969976321))<br />
is the irrevocability of a feature a big part of the design decision or is it more if a hindsight is 20/20 thing?<br />
For a live game (like LoL/WoW) you always have to think about the precedents you set. It's like being a SCOTUS judge. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642898697861206016))<br />
I wasn't paying attention during the Cata difficulty outrage--would it have been possible to soldier through?<br />
Yes. Better would have been to provide an alternative for those who didn't enjoy wiping. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643134188577755136))<br />
<br />
Why do you think many players are longing for TBC days. Raiding was impossible back then..<br />
I wouldn't call it nostalgia per se, but we remember the feeling we had when everything felt so new and we miss that feeling. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/643133300358410240))<br />
<br />
Game Design<br />
Thoughts on allowing (or not) respec in single player RPGs? Respec kinda waters down character building... (1/2)<br />
It depends if you want starting a new character to be a good or bad thing. No respec can encourage that. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642850183290552320))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
greg i really just want you to stop answering questions about world of warcraft and focus on your new better life, forever<br />
I try to answer questions that are applicable to game development as a whole. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/642898996378275841))<br />

Hello this is world of warcraft, you must be new here, we've had in jokes, talking cows, memes, a quest where you take a shit, and quest givers that break the 4th wall, all before the internet made anything as such 'a thing'.<br />
<br />
Pepe, is actually an annoying spanish child back in my day squirt, so go back to your internet overlords and cry into their laps, because you're too fresh faced to be talking so much utter baloney. <br />
<br />
I repeat, this is world of warcraft, it has always been a goddamn parody of what the western world considers 'high fantasy'. Get with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't say the audience is limited. I know a lot of people who played WC3 only, but they'll still go and see the movie, also I know a LOTR fan who is interested, because it's &quot;similar&quot;.<br />
There were 100 million WoW accounts 2 years ago if 100 million people go and watch this movie, the total gross would be above $1 billion. Okay obviously not all of them will go, but there are also WC 1,2,3 players, LOTR fans and even people who don't even know what Warcraft is will go and see the movie, because they'll like the trailer or they just like fantasy films... and don't forget there are WarCraft books as well.<br />
So, no it's not a limited audience, unless we call ~200 million people limited, but 200 million would break all records.<br />
<br />
However I think the movie will be bad (very bad), but I'll still go and see it in IMAX.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's his opinion guys, he went on record for his tenure at wow as liking the game to be challenging to a fault. You hated him while he worked there. <br />
<br />
I truly wish people would just stop along him about WoW. Game design choices fine, but at this point his opinions on WoW are no more illuminating than any of ours.</div></div><hr />

If you honestly think that the 100 million accounts belonged to a 100 million individual people then you're in for a shock...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That number included multiboxers, trial accounts, and tons of people that bought the game for 5 bucks and never logged on after making one or two characters. That is actually a bad number for wow considering the amount of player turnover that points out.</div></div><hr />

Street fighter, Mortal kombat, Ect</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">voskopoula</div><div class="date">2015-09-17, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">meh street fighter and mortal combat were so so, and they prove a point, that movies from games have a certain budget and thats it. The only good movie i remember being ok was resident evil? and perhaps that watchtower movie lately released.<br />
The good thing is if Blizzard gets crazy they can invest and pay their movie and good riddance to the morrons of universal and warner bros. Hell blizzard should pay it all themselves, just for the money we have given them all those years. I wouldn't mind pitching in, through a pet in blizzard (all money goes to actors :P ) . Or a &quot;if we get this amount of crowdfunding we will have harry potter play Khadgar&quot; :P or well you know this kind of stuff haha<br />
<br />
about ghostcrawler, i think this guy is now more of a trophy employee, taken from wow. Does anyone knows what he contributes in LoL? i mean which of the directions in lol are his? Anyone can tell us? i am curious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There have been very few decent ones but thats about it. You could probably count them all on one hand and I use decent very loosely.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of wow gamers over the past 10 years and even more from back in the warcraft days that have no interest in sitting through a wow movie.<br />
<br />
Netflix, dvd or apple TV rented maybe but not at a theater. It's like I've said in past threads. It's a video game to movie and decent special effects wont save it. Changes in story to make it more &quot;general audience appealing' isn't going to help ticket sales.<br />
<br />
I'm expecting it to make back the money it spent to make the movie but overall be considered a flop. Kinda like Prince of Persia and The Seventh Son. Barely decent enough to make the cost back but overall never going to see a squeal because it's wasn't all that good a movie. BUT if it pulled a fantastic Four move and just bombed I wouldn't be surprised either.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buck-Shot</div><div class="date">2015-09-17, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">of course is a problem movie...

<br />
Are you for real? It`s one year because they delayed by 3 months to make it a summer &quot;blockbuster&quot; (khmm-khmm) They finished the shooting ages ago, only the CGI polishing left. Originally the release date was 11 march 2016. And guess what..You can see promo trailers years before a movie going into the cinemas. For example Deadpool coming to UK in february, the trailer available ages ago, Suicide Squad in August..trailer available ages ago.....Honestly where have you been in the last 10-20 years?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The thing with Hollywood.. they like to see every movie release make at least 3 time what it cost to make+promo.. But it's not going to happen, and realistically not every video game is going to have great film, adaptations.. The medium isn't 1:1, what works in interacting isn't going to work just watching..<br />
<br />
Mind you most AAA video games have good stories that can become movies but problem is when you have the game first then the movie. person go in with the expectation that it will be just like a chapter out the game.. While Hollywood is writing there chapter in the games universe.. <br />
<br />
Resident Evil started well but Hollywood got greedy and messed it up, now most don't care anymore.. Tomb Raider was decent-Good and they wisely decide no more... <br />
<br />
Hollywood wants game to film to be the next gold mine but the thing is hardly anyone in hollywood take games (or there fans) serious.. So they keep putting out half Hat effort and expect to make a quick profit and move on..<br />

Are you for real? It`s one year because they delayed by 3 months to make it a summer &quot;blockbuster&quot; (khmm-khmm) They finished the shooting ages ago, only the CGI polishing left. Originally the release date was 11 march 2016. And guess what..You can see promo trailers years before a movie going into the cinemas. For example Deadpool coming to UK in february, the trailer available ages ago, Suicide Squad in August..trailer available ages ago.....Honestly where have you been in the last 10-20 years?<br />
<br />
Actually they DON'T want to touch the summer release window... it will get drown behind the big hitters.. They are smart for releasing it March and lets hope Winter isn't bad because if it is it means less starting money...<br />
<br />
This film will be judge (financially) on what in can make in 2 weeks, because they have those 2 weeks easy.. If it doesn't crack 110-150 mil within 2 weeks domestically, no sequel.. Unless Blizz themselves funds 75%+ of the next project</div></div><hr />

It's very bizarre that there's so little official footage and information available. I reckon it'll do fairly well for itself based on the brand name alone...but it won't necessarily capture the spirit of the Warcraft franchise. I suspect it'll be like the recent Fantastic Four movie.</div></div><hr />

Ehm, well Avengers Age of Ultron trailer were released late october 2014 and had its premier in May i belive. That is 8 months between. Will prob be the same with the Captain America Civil War trailer. They have shown footage at D23 but they dont want to show it to everyone yet. A way to hype things up. Many trailers like Sucide Squad were only released because it was leaked from comic con.</div></div><hr />

This is of course evident by all of the delays, changes in directors etc.<br />
<br />
It is also evident in the way they are marketing (or not marketing) the movie. This IS NOT a computer game and blizzard is treating it as such playing everything close to the chest.<br />
<br />
I am sure they are ready to get it released, off the table, and get blizzard out of their hair.</div></div><hr />

15 years ago you could ask the same thing about comic book based movies. Now we're swimming in good comic book adaptations.<br />

Its a problem movie because instead of it just being licensed out, blizzard has been TOO involved in its creation. Too many cooks in the kitchen and that sort of thing.<br />
<br />
This is of course evident by all of the delays, changes in directors etc.<br />
It changed directors once, before a script had been finalized and production began.<br />
<br />
It's been delayed twice. The first delay was because Star Wars Episode VII was announced as premiering on the same day and they didn't want to compete with the most anticipated film of the years. The second was to move it from spring to summer so it could draw a bigger box office.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is also evident in the way they are marketing (or not marketing) the movie. This IS NOT a computer game and blizzard is treating it as such playing everything close to the chest.<br />
The movie is still close to a year away. They're going to start promoting it next month, with Blizzcon, and marketing will ramp up as it gets closer to release.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard isn't in charge of marketing or distribution for the movie, Legendary and Universal are.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am sure they are ready to get it released, off the table, and get blizzard out of their hair.<br />
They want it to premier in Summer 2016. Universal shifted their entire 2016 movie slate around to get Warcraft into a coveted Summer Box Office slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suicide squad footage leaks and the studios respond with hd quality release of the same footage a day or three later.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile if you want a glimpse of the Warcraft movie you need to to venture into the deep web, its neatly tucked away next to child porn, and snuff videos. Good marketing strategy!</div></div><hr />

What are we basing good on? Money made? Public enjoyment?<br />
If it needs to be both the only one you'd have a case for would be maybe mortal kombat if you prefer metacritic over rotten tomatoes. <br />
If it's just money made there's been a few that made more than they cost yet there's only been 5 that's made more than 200 million and only one that's made 300 million. <br />

Also, not picking on GC but I found it funny is this quote from him &quot; wouldn't call it nostalgia per se, but we remember the feeling we had when everything felt so new and we miss that feeling&quot;<br />
P sure that's part of what nostalgia is, missing things from the older days.</div></div><hr />

If I ride a single damned flying moose flight path in Legion I swear I will be done with this game. I'm willing to write them off in WoD as a poor decision seeing as how the whole expansion is a poor decision. But if they continue it in Legion that will push me over the edge. I'm all for pay for mounts...just quit shoving them in my face. If they are going to do that at least let them be BoE so people can sell them on the AH if they so choose.</div></div><hr />

Yes you will.<br />

Only way I'll see it is when it's free. I started over 10 years ago with WoW and close to 20 years with Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you will see it when tis free. Most likely at a friends house or whatever. You can convince yourself to hate wow and all things assoicated with it. But it would be folly to try and convince me that after 20 years you are to cheap to pay for a movie ticket for one of the years biggest fantasy movies.<br />
Even though i dislike what happened with star wars, and i've never cared much for Star Trek i'm still watching everything related to it in the movie-theatre. Because the genre interests me.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
The people who say no to polls like that are the butthurt ones. The ones who constantly cry about content. The ones with the rose-tinted glasses. But interestingly also the ones who sit up for 4 days straight after a new expansion hits.</div></div><hr />
