Taking a Look Back at May 15 - 21 (http://www.hearthpwn.com/news/2860-what-happened-in-hearthstone-taking-a-look-back-at)<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2 Hotfixes - May 22<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
“Grand Opening (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10697-grand-opening)” now requires 8 spotlights activated during the Chronomatic Anomaly encounter (was 12).<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Monk<br />
<br />
Ironskin and Fortifying Brew once again grant the correct Stagger percentage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Hall<br />
<br />
Artifact Knowledge can now be researched to a maximum level of 40 (was 50).<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: We raised the Knowledge cap from 40 to 50 very late in the 7.2 PTR cycle, out of an abundance of caution: We wanted to ensure that players of all playstyles, as well as alt characters, would view the Concordance trait as accessible. However, between the additional Artifact Power gains added in 7.2 and others that were hotfixed in after the patch released, we’re now well ahead of that mark. Knowledge 40 now seems more than sufficient for players to reach Concordance, and the prospect of months’ worth of additional Knowledge still left to research makes some players feel like their efforts in the interim aren’t meaningful. Therefore, we’re rolling the cap back to 40.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Deepwind Dunk is now 15 minutes long, and each player killed during Deepwind Dunk awards 5 points.<br />
Paladin<br />
<br />
Attacking a Judged target will now cause Judge Unworthy to only spread that target's Judgment, instead of all your nearby Judgments.<br />
Judge Unworthy can now spread Judgment to targets that are under the effects of crowd-control abilities.<br />
Damage from Lawbringer can no longer cause Judge Unworthy to spread Judgment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UI<br />
<br />
Players using Korean and Chinese clients can now chat in public chat channels on the Broken Shore.<br />

They aren't referencing solely AK. They are referencing the fact that right now getting AP would be useless compared a month down the road, which is entirely true. One hour of 'work' getting AP now is about the same as two minutes of work getting AP in a month.<br />
<br />
This is achieving two things. One your work now isn't completely useless and two the effective 'cap' on how much longer you need to 'grind' AP just got reduced by a lot. Considering they every AK rank is basically 30% more of the previous one, we will reach the upward limits of how many ranks of concordance you can really obtain a lot sooner. With AK 50 after 3-4 months you might have seen people in the upper twenties, or the low thirties at the absolute maximum. With this change you're going to see people around 15.<br />
<br />
Considering concordance gives less overall DPS than the flat 0.5% ranks in the old system, they are basically telling you that you need not worry about AP anymore (unless you're really far behind, but even then if you have AK 40 it wouldn't take long to to get to 52).</div></div><hr />

The truth is more likely that many players reached concordance during the last days and then stopped farming AP cause they could as well wait for level 50(by doing 1 click all 2 weeks) and then doing catch up with just a few WQs....and get the other artifact weapons up in no time. Blizz was afraid people won't sink enough time into AP.<br />
Need proof? Well, they could just up the % increase for 40 levels(so spread the increase about 40 instead of 50 levels). That would pretty much cover their given reason. But Blizz ain't going with that simple solution....</div></div><hr />

That work later is better than work now isn't a bug, it's one of the two major driving forces which allow players to not give a damn about AP if they don't want to, the other major force being the incredibly small benefits of additional points in Concordance.<br />
<br />
Capping it sooner is just pointless, and makes doing things like working on alts, swapping mains, and the like harder for no reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. Given the timeline of patches this expansion, it's pretty much a forgone conclusion that 7.3 is likely ~3 months away. 7.3 will likely have changes to AK once again, or new traits, much like 7.2 had.<br />
<br />
Given that AK50 would have been finished slightly before such a date, it's probably better for alts anyway. When are you going to have time to swap alts/mains when AK 50 hasn't been out for long, and 7.3 is right around the corner. At least this shifts the goal post a couple months earlier. If you want to start working on alts/mains, you can pretty much do it now. My mage who does nothing but emissaries and mission table stuff is 48.<br />
<br />
Most classes don't gain anything tangible between 47-51 (class varies), with 52 being the only 'big' point. &quot;Big&quot; point is kind of misleading, as while concordance is a boost, some classes gained more from single points in their old 3/3 points than even the big point in concordance gave them. Basically if you want to work on alts or change characters, (even though ToS is on the horizon), now isn't a bad time to do it.<br />
<br />
I fully realize that work later is better than work now, that's been the fundamental benefit/flaw of the entire system since it was released this expansion.<br />
<br />
Their reasoning is shitty though. You only need a simple understanding in math to conclude that 50 wasn't needed to get concordance. Also on that same note, you only need to understand simple math to understand that even at 50... maxing the weapon would take well beyond Legion to accomplish lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, it wasn't possible to max out weapon at AK 50. You had to do 2.9 million mythic raid bosses with AK 50 to get max concordance. It'd take somewhere around 20 years of constantly doing m+s to get there.</div></div><hr />

Oh well. Still shitty move imo. Especially for people with alts.</div></div><hr />

Good thing they changed this before anyone actually hit 40+ or people would lose their shit as they always do when something is actually nerfed.<br />
<br />
40 could've been the cap from the go and then you'd have nothing to whine about. Considering the release pacing 40 is a lot better paced overall than getting AK50 in a month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even at 50 maxing the weapon was impossible. If you had AK50 and an infinite supply of base 1000 AP tokens (which at AK50 would have been giving you 550 million AP each) it would take you about 10 years just to right click all the tokens and sit through the 2 second channel time assuming you were just doing that 24 hours a day.

Think you fudged the numbers a bit somewhere. Or maybe I did. I came up with about 36 days of right clicking 1000AP tokens (granting 550m AP).<br />
<br />
865,842,644,766,330AP to max<br />
So you need 1574260 1000AP tokens to max<br />
2 seconds per cast is 3,148,520 seconds<br />
52,475 minutes<br />
874.58 hours<br />
36.4 days<br />
<br />
Still pretty much impossible, just not AS impossible</div></div><hr />

For mains, I don't think it'll be realistically possible to hit 20 points in concordance now. That kind of sucks too but getting to 11 was basically the point where going beyond was kinda crazy.

No! They thought the super casual ppl that do maybe only a few wq's per week would need 50 to hit it. But probably they realized with an open system like this that ppl willing to farm a lot would get more levels in concordance than what they are willing to let you get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that was kind of just the reasonable spot for me. I think I should've been more specific about that was MY goal and getting to 11 even seems like a lot now. I was looking at the math and to get to 11 in Concordance, we'll need ~31B AP. That's about 10x what point 52 is... which was fine because we were going to end up getting more than 10x the AP we're getting now but with this nerf, it's going to take 10x longer to get there when it was already kind of slow. I think that's kind of the point of the complaints. We went from 'Hey this is kind of worth it to do whenever we feel like it&quot; to &quot;Holy FUCK, why am I even logging into this game anymore?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Everything just got 10x longer related to AP when it was already going to reach a point where it was worthless to do. It feels like everyone is going to end up just raid-logging again. We're going to login, do our +15s and our raid and logout again. It's WoD all over again. Most WQs will be worthless, most M+ will be worthless. This change basically nerfs the expansion's 'carrot-on-the-stick' of AP. I don't really get why they want to remove any reasonable interest in that when anyone who didn't want to do the grind didn't need to.</div></div><hr />

That is assuming you can actually HOLD the million+ tokens needed.

If anything, this change is alt friendly. Mains will become pointless to grind AP on with capped AK, even if you cannot cap the Concordance on them. The cost in hours played per upgrade will become so extreme you'd be better off improving an alt. With this change that point will be reached a couple of months sooner.</div></div><hr />

While your opinion is of course valid, personally I think it gives everyone the chance to improve and upgrade their weapon without getting drops for it. In the past, getting the weapon drop you needed could be very frustrating. Of course, we now have the drops for three relics but at least you can still upgrade the weapon and work toward it reliably.</div></div><hr />

With 7.3 (and beyond) they will obviously increase the base AP gain of the worldquest (at least the new ones on argus, like they did with the ones on broken shore compared to broken isle, maybe with an even bigger gap) and the mythic+, so you'll get 20m AP for wq, 40m for M+ etc. <br />

Hmm, so our math is wrong, because they will change the variables in the future... Interesting approach towards math :)<br />
<br />
BTW: They did not increase the base AP gain for world quests on broken shore. It's just that you now have more Artifact Knowledge that you get more out of them. At AK 40, you would already get 24M AP from the broken shore world quests. This is all factored in in the calculations. In fact, all of the calculations I made are based on AK 50 even, so a WQ on the broken shore gives 331M in my calculation at 55.2M% AK.</div></div><hr />

&lt;snip&gt;<br />
<br />
I don't understand this logic and I see it thrown around a lot. At 52 points it's a +2k primary stat proc, 10 points later at 62 it's a +4k primary stat proc. How is double the proc considered very little benefit? Give it another 20 points at 82 and it's now an +8k proc for four times original value. Let's go to extremes and say someone maxed it at 101 artifact level for an +11.8k proc. If you had someone at 52 traits with their +2k proc versus someone with a +11.8k proc would you still think there's very little benefit between the two players?</div></div><hr />

I stopped doing AK work orders on alts at AK 30 and burning the resources, thinking I could eventually get my main to 50, buy books for 45 and then grind the last 5 levels on the alts (thereby saving myself from farming several thousand resources across more than a dozen characters, but then it got even better with this tidbit:<br />
<br />
To that end, the item Artifact Research Compendium: Volumes I-VII is being changed to grant Artifact Knowledge level 40 instead of level 35. As before, it will be purchasable in the Order Hall by characters who have reached AK 40. This means that players will be able to immediately catch-up to the AK cap on alts once they have access to this book, which should make the process of getting to Concordance on alts less daunting too.<br />
<br />
Sweet. So as soon as my main hits 40, I can buy books for the alts (obviously no resource issues on my main) and get them to 40 too. Works for me.</div></div><hr />

Each level from then will take 30% more time than the previous, i.e. we are all currently throttled at 1 level / 5 days. <br />
<br />
The first 5 levels after capping will take roughly 50 days, the next 5 would take 191 assuming my effortto be a constant. Assuming i will spend 100 days upgrading my mainspec i will add 7 levels to the 56 i had when AK capped --&gt; My mainspec will cap at 63 instead of 73. <br />

It's not really....at least for people who are only there as DPS. IF unholy is ahead of frost, I have to make sure my unholy weapon is up to snuff. And while that's easy enough now since all my AP drops from NH will go to unholy, it still won't get me to 52 before TOS unless I do more grinding. However, it only makes the grind on alts even less tolerable...concordance was a simmed 10k dps increase for me...so realistically it's probably a 6-8k increase....hardly worth the time I invested in getting it...unless it's not simming right. I cba to do this crap on my alts now, and makes me want to play them even less...if anything now I'll level my alts and play their campaign and be done with them. Expansion is too far to reroll, and with the legendary system I dont want to redo that on a new toon, already did it on an enhance shaman and now back on my dk....thanks but no thanks.</div></div><hr />
