Beta Realms - Maintenance 9/5/08<br />
We will be taking down the Beta realms at 10:30AM Pacific time today September 5th 2008 for maintenance.<br />
<br />
We expect this process to take from six to eight hours.<br />
We're going to try to patch today. <br />
Icecrown, the exterior zone, will be shipped out with the expansion. Icecrown Citadel, the dungeon/raid experience, will be part of a future patch. <br />
Storm Peaks will be in this patch. If it continues to crash the server, we'll have to turn it off again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Premade Characters<br />
Premades weren't supposed to be active today<br />
Actually, the premades being available on the existing realms was a mistake. They are being removed. There will be a specific premade realm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9641624570-beta-concerns-regarding-premades.html))<br />
<br />
Premade Realm<br />
Murmur will be the new Premade realm. Premades will be removed from &quot;Northrend&quot; and &quot;Lich King&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9658135792-murmer.html))<br />
<br />
XP Tuning<br />
The XP tuning is getting closer. We're going to do a minor adjustment in today's patch. 10% faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, hopefully the patch brings some nice changes :) <br />
<br />
Wondering about the &quot;10% faster XP&quot; though. Is it really needed? I'm doing pretty well &amp; fast on the beta, it feels perfect now, and imo there shouldn't be an adjustment in the 70-80 range.</div></div><hr />

lvling just fucking sucks.. they should boost the XP gain by 100% :D</div></div><hr />

With rested state atm I get ~1900xp per kill, and it's almost double that in instances.<br />
<br />
After starting at 68 in Borean Tundra, Howling Fjord, Dragonblight &amp; Grizzly Hills, my death-knight is 76 + 12 bars, that leaves me 3 levels for 5 zones I have left.</div></div><hr />

that may be due to overtuned DK damage maybe? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Northrend zones are huge, you shouldn't need to do all Northrend quests to get to level 80. Choosing where you actually want to level is much better than having to do absolutely everything.<br />
<br />
<br />

That probably means the changes are in but everything that was changed isn't functioning yet.</div></div><hr />

(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9641624570-beta-concerns-regarding-premades.html))i like how the op in that thread goes like there should be a way to tell whether characters are premades or not, cause people who level their characters to 80 will be in full level 80 pvp gear that look like season 4</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm doing all the quests just to see what's worth doing while leveling, and what should be left for gold at 80. <br />
If I have 3 full zones of quests to do just for gold, it will be quite rewarding :) <br />
<br />
And it's not entirely due to the overtuned DK damage, it's the same on my shammy &amp; druid as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I'm pretty sure they are still flagged once renamed and such just in the data file it creates.<br />
<br />
And I'm hoping to see some interesting stuff here for classes, especially since they seem to be getting close to wanting to put some content on the PTR as well.</div></div><hr />
