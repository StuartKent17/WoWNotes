Patch 5.1 PTR Notes Update - November 8<br />
Only changed and new notes are below, see the full notes on the Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239910-patch-51-public-test-realm-now-live/).<br />
General<br />
The Pandaren Campaign begins!<br />
<br />
Players can visit their faction strongholds in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms to begin the quest to summon their war fleets to the continent of Pandaria. (Alliance players that couldn't previously complete the starting quests can now speak with Taradormi at Lion's Landing to travel the timeways and experience those quests... BACK IN TIME).<br />
Players can follow the story of the Pandaren Campaign through a series of special quests tied to their reputation with the landing forces. Heroes assisting with the war effort will join key characters and faction leaders as the growing conflagration spreads across Pandaria... as well as other locations around Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brawler's Guild<br />
<br />
Entry into the brawler’s guild is by invitation only. Invitations can be found on the black market auction house, by invitation from somebody within the guild, and occasionally as drops from certain Horde and Alliance NPCs.<br />
<br />

<br />
New Pet Ability: Water Jet. Water Jet channels a jet of frigid water at the target, dealing Frost damage over 4 seconds. Frostbolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116) cast by the pet's owner that hit the target while it is being blasted with icy water will grant a charge of Fingers of Frost (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/112965). This ability has a 24 second cooldown (shared with Freeze) and a 1 second cast time.<br />

Spear Hand Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116705) now costs 10 energy (was 30).<br />

Spells affected by Inner Focus (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/89485) cast while Spirit Shell (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/109964) is active now fully apply critical effect heals to the shield provided.<br />

Aura of the Elements (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/116202-aura-of-the-elements)and Aura of Enfeeblement (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/116198-aura-of-enfeeblement) can now be dispelled as Magic effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Spirit of Harmony (http://www.wowdb.com/items/76061-spirit-of-harmony) can now be purchased for 600 Conquest Points at the Conquest Quartermaster.<br />
The Dancing Steel, Jade Spirit, Colossus, and River’s Song enchantments now use the Real PPM system utilized by Windsong and Elemental Force.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sunsong Ranch<br />
<br />
A new Seed has been added: Portal Shards<br />
<br />
A mage who fell on hard times back in Dalaran has found a new home on Pandaria. Barnaby Fletcher will occasionally visit Halfhill Market to peddle a new type of seed – and take advantage of the Tillers’ hospitality.<br />
Portal Shards grow into consumable items which can be used to open a portal from Sunsong Ranch to a major faction city.<br />
<br />
Seeds now stack to 50.<br />
Runty crops now have a spell visual to help call attention to themselves.<br />
Growing crops now display the duration until the crop is ready to harvest.<br />
Characters who have earned the “Friends on the Farm” achievement will no longer find gifts while harvesting Cooking Ingredient crops – instead, they have a chance to find special seeds such as Magebulb, Enigma Seed, Songbell, and more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids, Dungeons and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Non-boss enemies in Mogu'shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, and Terrace of Endless Spring now respawn much more slowly.<br />
Raid groups are no longer necessary to enter pre-Mists of Pandara raid dungeons. Enemies in these raids that previously required more than one player to defeat are now more easily dealt with by players battling alone.<br />
Scenarios<br />
<br />
New level 90 Scenarios have been added, including additional faction specific Scenarios:<br />
<br />
Assault on Zan'Vess<br />
Alliance<br />
<br />
Lion's Landing<br />
A Little Patience<br />
<br />
Horde<br />
<br />
Domination Point<br />
Dagger in the Dark<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
The growing conflict between the Horde and the Alliance has spilled across the face of Azeroth: level 90 players can now queue for Wintergrasp and Tol Barad via the PvP tab to battle one another in these epic conflicts.<br />
Arena matches now have a 25 minute time limit (was 45 minutes).<br />
Rated Battlegrounds now share the same spell restrictions as Arenas.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
Swooping Plainshawks no longer use abilities from the Bird of Prey Hunter pet family.<br />
Fixed an issue that could cause crops to fail to appear when players entered Sunsong Ranch while several hundred yards up in the air.<br />
Players who have learned the Terrible Turnip pet can now continue to find Ominous Seeds when harvesting Cooking Ingredient crops.<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
The responsiveness of many abilities and effects has been improved, including: Renewing Mist (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115151), Halo (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/120696), Rogue Poisons, Revealing Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/84617), Rime (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/59057), Killing Machine (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/51128), Maelstrom Weapon (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/51530), Sudden Doom (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/49530), Ultimatum (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/122509), Scent of Blood (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/49509), Crimson Scourge (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/81136), and Sudden Death (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/29725).<br />
The following spells now display less intense visual effects for other players: Hellfire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1949), Death and Decay (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/43265), Hurricane (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/42231), Astral Storm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/106998), and Explosive Trap (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/13813).<br />
Earthquake (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/61882) sound effect is now quieter.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure it's referring to bosses whose mechanics meant soloing was impossible for a lot of classes (like Razorgore) than straight up nerfs to health/damage.</div></div><hr />

Let's hope so. But from my long-term experience with Blizzard, they will implement couple of all-around nerfs 'just because' since they're taking the time to make some changes to these raids anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I can't find it in the current patchnotes, it used to have these changes listed:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Tidal Shield cast by High Warlord Naj'entus now has a reduced duration.<br />
Razorgore the Untamed no longer takes extra damage from Black Talon enemies, has more health, and can cast Destroy Egg more frequently.<br />
Viscidus now requires significantly fewer hits to freeze and Shatter.<br />
<br />
<br />
(source: http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2999-Patch-5-1-PTR-Notes-Update-November-2)<br />
<br />
I don't think there's that much more nerfs to bosses. It seems they're mainly nerfing the ones that are both near-impossible to solo and drop a pet. (For example, Viscidus dropping http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=93039)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vashj already is soloable, they dropped the paralysis from the cores a long time ago. (in p3 she hits for 25k on mail with 99 stacks, but that's the highest it can go)<br />
<br />
Dunno why Najentus needed nerfing though, given that anyone at 90 can pull the 44k dps needed to zerg him before the shield comes up. (I was doing it at 85)<br />
<br />
<br />
If they nerf raids so hat they can very easily soloed by anyone I will be really unhappy since I've always liked to solo old content that was somewhat challenging.<br />
<br />
Same here, but there was only the 3 bosses mentioned in previous notes (though hopefully they'll sort some of the other bosses like gunship). Some bosses actually got buffed in 5.0 too (such as Felmyst, KJ and Mimiron) so I'm hoping this means that blanket nerfs aren't in the picture.</div></div><hr />

Hell yeah! Thank you Blizzard :) <br />
Soloable Razorgore I hope!</div></div><hr />

<br />
what about 2v2 some ppl play gay fights only peel for healers. can get to 35 mins 25 mins will scrow 2v2 and i play only 2v2 so if its go live i probably quit wow.and alot of 2v2 players will do the same so make it only for 3v3 and leve 2v2 as it is 45 mins..<br />
<br />
They're trying to lessen the burden of fights that go to stalemates, i.e. a 1 healer + 1 DPS team in 2s taking on a 2 healer team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't be unfair...I can easily solo everything with my blood DK and my paladin, I can do some with my shadow priest and warlock...but some classes are weaker to solo than others. The old raids are there for Transmogrification only, their gold loots already been nerfed to the ground. Doesn't a mage for example worth to obtain some old tiers for transmog? What will hurt? Its nothing special to solo some old raids with paladins and DK's so there is no glory to be stealed or shared...</div></div><hr />

You are incorrect on one thing. It IS a change to the notes. Blizzard just decided not to give it the 'red ink' as if they are trying to sneak the nerf in. Whoever has the job to read patch notes should know that the shaman nerf is new.</div></div><hr />

What are you pointing out? DK's and Shamans have little to no changes for the next patch. DK's aren't vastly unbalanced by any means, but we definitely need a post-mop polish.</div></div><hr />
