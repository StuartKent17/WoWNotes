The preview of Shadowmourne (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=906) was fairly popular and it's time for a small update. <br />
<br />
One of the last quest of the chain requires you to gather The Splintered Throne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24548/the-splintered-throne/) requires you to acquire 50 Shadowfrost Shards (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50274/shadowfrost-shard/). We didn't know the droprates until recently, the official armory has been updated with most of the data from patch 3.3 and gave us a few numbers :<br />
<br />
Shards only drop in 25-man from any boss of the instance.<br />
25-man normal mode bosses have a medium (25-50%) chance to drop a shard.<br />
25-man heroic mode bosses have a high (51-99%) chance to drop a shard.<br />
<br />
If we assume that you kill all the boss in hard modes you should get an average of 9 shards each week and it will take 6 weeks to upgrade Shadow's Edge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49888/shadows-edge/) to Shadowmourne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49623/shadowmourne/)<br />
<br />
You now have all the info you need to decide who gets it in your guild. Make sure you check the Shadowmourne Preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=906) if you missed it!<br />

Upcoming Armory Features - Update<br />
On Saturday I reported that the official armory would get a few extra features (most likely in January 2010). The most interesting one (with the model viewer) is probably the Character Feed, this feature will let you build an RSS feed to report all the new achievementS/items on one or more characters based on a few criterias. You can check the FAQ below, it was removed from the official site a few hours after it went online. Once again, this feature is not live and you should expect it in January 2010<br />
<br />
The FAQ of the Calendar Feed is also included but I don't think a lot of people will be excited about this one, I don't think a lot of people use the in-game calendar. It could be a good way to have out of game reminders for important events like the Kalu'ak Fishing Derby (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=918) and a few other things. <br />
Character Feed FAQ<br />
What is the character activity feed?<br />
Each character's activity feed shows the most recent in-game actions of the character that can be recorded by the Armory. These include achievements, boss kills, item acquisitions, and more. Character feeds can be customized using our customization tool, then exported as RSS feeds to your RSS reader of choice.<br />
<br />
How do I create a customized character feed?<br />
Click the RSS icon on the character's profile page (the orange icon on the upper right of the recent activity summary) to go to the Character Feed Customization page. The options on this page allow you to create a custom RSS feed that you can export to an RSS reader.<br />
<br />
You can enter up to five characters to aggregate into a single RSS feed. Enter each character in a name@realm format. If you are logged in, you do not need to specify the realm - it will default to the currently viewed character's realm.<br />
Achievement categories can be individually toggled to filter them in or out of the RSS feed.<br />
Achievement criteria include any intermediate steps within an achievement, such as defeating a particular boss in an achievement to defeat every boss in a particular raid dungeon. Toggling this category off will turn off all achievement criteria globally, while turning it on will still follow the rules that you select in the Achievement category (for example, turning off Quests in the Achievement category will turn off the criteria in this category as well).<br />
The Boss Kills category includes any boss that is tracked in the Statistics tab of a character profile. These include the end bosses of classic and Burning Crusade dungeons, and every boss in Wrath of the Lich King raids.<br />
Loot acquisitions can be assigned different rarity thresholds to appear in the feed. You can specify a minimum item level as well.<br />
<br />
How do I use the custom feed once I create it?<br />
The URL for your custom RSS feed updates in real time as you change options and enter character names. When you are satisfied with the options and characters you selected, simply copy and paste the resulting URL into an RSS reader. Online RSS readers include iGoogle, Netvibes, and Pageflakes, to name a few. You can also import RSS feeds into Outlook and other e-mail clients. In addition, clicking the Facebook icon (which appears near the RSS icon on character profiles) allows you to integrate the Armory's feeds into Facebook.<br />
<br />
Can I customize the feed that appears in the Character Feed tab of a character profile?<br />
In contrast to the RSS feeds created on the Character Feed Customization page, the feeds that appear on character profiles (on the main page and the 'Activity Feed' tab) are intended to be an unfiltered feed of a character's recent activity and as such can not be customized.<br />
<br />
Why isn't the Armory's custom feed page finding a particular character that I enter in the character name field?<br />
Only characters on US realms are stored here, as this is the US version of the Armory. To switch to a different region, such as Europe, go to their regional World of Warcraft website and access the Armory from there. In addition, a character must be recently active and be at least level 10 to have a character feed. When entering character names, keep spaces in realm names ('Black Dragonflight') and make sure the character and name realm is spelled correctly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Calendar Feed FAQ<br />
What is the custom calendar tool?<br />
The custom calendar tool allows you to export in-game player calendar data to calendar applications such as Outlook, or to online calendars such as Google Calendar. The tool can aggregate up to five characters on your account in a single feed, and is automatically synched with the characters' in-game player calendars.<br />
<br />
How do I create a customized calendar feed?<br />
Use the Armory's main menu or click the link on the top right of a character's calendar page to access the Calendar Feed Customization tool. The options on this page allow you to create a custom calendar feed that you can export to any compatible application or website. You can choose up to five characters on your account to aggregate into a single calendar feed. Simply select the characters you wish to appear in the feed from the drop-down menus. Event categories can be individually toggled to filter them in or out of the feed.<br />
<br />
How do I use the custom feed once I create it?<br />
The URL for your custom feed updates in real time as you select options and characters. Simply copy and paste the URL into an online calendar such as Google Calendar when you are finished configuring your custom feed. In addition, clicking on the URL from this page will download a file that can be imported into compatible applications such as Outlook<br />
<br />
Is the calendar feed automatically synched with in-game player calendars?<br />
Yes. Calendar feeds created with this tool should always be automatically up-to-date with in-game player calendars.<br />
<br />
What is the 'reset security key' option used for?<br />
Each calendar feed URL contains a unique security key appended to the end of the URL. This key is intended to keep your calendar data inaccessible to others. If you wish, you can reset your security key at any time by clicking the 'reset security key' button at the bottom of the page. If you reset your key, you must update the URL in your web-based calendars, or re-download the calendar file to use it with a calendar application.<br />

Blue posts<br />
Legendary weapons upgrades<br />
Legendaries are not intended to be the last weapon you'll ever need. WoW is a game about upgrading your stuff. ([url=http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/21730676505-the-real-reason-valanyr-will-remain-245.html]Source (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/december/armory.jpg))<br />
<br />
Dungeon System kick rules<br />
I believe the no-kick grace period is only 5 min, but we iterated on that a lot, so I could be wrong. If they DC you can kick after 1 min.<br />
<br />
I suspect it's going to take a few tries before we get the vote kick thing feeling right. I hope it's obvious what purpose it serves though. We feared without some kind of grace period that a common behavior would be to automatically kick someone in greens or without certain achievements or perhaps even someone who would roll against you on stuff (in the partial premade situation).

<br />
Cataclysm masteries and PvP/PvE<br />
Masteries are much broader than you're imagining from your examples. They are designed to have PvP and PvE benefit. Otherwise you wouldn't be able to use each of the 30 trees in both environments, which is the ultimate goal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21730677294-will-there-be-pvp-mastery-for-cata.html))<br />
<br />
Recycled graphics in dungeons<br />
We get a little more art for a raid tier than we used to, but we create many more items than we used to. I believe the new Icecrown raid and dungeon introduced something like 1800 new items to WoW. While it would be awesome for every piece to have unique art, that's not a realistic goal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/21724986207-new-hor-shield-is-a-recycled-graphic.html))<br />

SW:P not affected by haste<br />
Have a hot or dot affected by haste is not a no-brainer. It might be if you have a mechanic that automatically refreshes the hot or dot, but not every spell fits into that category. For those spells, the hot or dot actually finishes sooner so you have to find time to squeeze in a GCD to get it going again. In some situations that will work out well for you. In others, not so much.<br />
<br />
Simply keeping the current duration and letting the hots tick faster is problematic because then it's a much bigger dps increase -- you are just getting more damage per unit time. At some point, haste might even trump spell power as a dps stat.<br />
<br />
Long-term, we need for every spec to care about say crit and haste to some degree. When crit or haste are junk stats for anyone, then a ton of gear is just not anything you'll even consider. It's okay if say Shadow Priests like crit more and Fire mages like haste more, but it's just too extreme right now (or at least before these changes).

Nerf to hasted corruption<br />
I do want to point out one side effect - when we could roll hasted corruption we COULD top the DPS charts - not destroy other classes but we had a chance to reach the #1 spot. I hope this issue will make GC re-asses our lack of damage output.<br />
No, you were destroying the other classes, except for Mutilate rogues and Unholy DKs, who were also nerfed. I think the only difference is that for the rogues and DKs it was easier to do so, while only the better locks could really come out with the great numbers. But being hard to do is no excuse for someone's dps to be gratuitously higher than everyone else.

I don't think it's 4 votes to kick... any longer? I was in an h nexus and a scrub wanted to vote kick the tank. I clicked no but he was still booted. so 3/5 is most likely.<br />

<br />
But what gets my back are the people who turn up with pvp gear, no gems, no enchants on 213/232 epics that they have received for running a 5man heroic, they have not had raiding expenses so there is no excuse really.<br />

I have had a lot of people with blues and made epics hitting 4k, and it is excellent to see these people, it truly is.</div></div><hr />

as we all know, that one has the most boring encounter ever.<br />
Sooo, some lock decided to AFK the whole fight, and as a healer I wanted to get her killed by standing on her to have more chance for the last beam to kill her.<br />
Sadly enough, she survived with 2k hp...<br />
Anyway, after the fight (finaly) ended, I just healed her and she got back.<br />
I just wanted to kick her as she simple went AFK so she didn't have to do the encounter, but I got the error that I couldn't kick her.<br />
Well I just thought it was because we didn't loot the chest yet and thought it was an anti-ninja system,... it lasted untill we walked all the way back to the door of the last boss.<br />
By the time it finally worked the other members probably didn't see the reason for the kick (as they prob also didn't see her being AFK) and declined...</div></div><hr />

It's a GAME. Try playing because it's fun, not because you get to be a jerk. If you don't like the idea of getting put RANDOMLY with someone that might be inferior to your epic skills, or doesn't play to your time frames, et - Don't use the random tool..</div></div><hr />

I can see the no sockets and maybe no enchants but you'd kick people in quest gear? I mean, thats kind of harse...its not like its not doable with that gear...depending how they gear. I did heroics at 80 in half tier 6 and a few quest blues and we dominated them. Why cant you just see how the run goes before you make any judgements? Its thinking like you are doing that is making the game less fun for others. If someone in poor gear was in a heroic and kept dying or face pulling...yeah I can see kicking them. Or if they actually have epics but didnt gem them...or enchant some of the easier pieces...I can see that too. <br />
<br />
I dinged 80 on my paladin Monday night before the patch...ran toc regular once..got one epic and the rest of my gear was poor. I didnt have much quest gear, I got some stuff off the ah (still blue) and had heirloom 2h axe, heirloom shoulders and chest. I did a bunch of heroics, sat at about 2k dps and we didnt have any problems. Save your judgement for 5 or 10 minutes into the instance. Or at least to the first boss. If they struggle or die to standing in something...then kick them. <br />
<br />
Dont bitch that &quot;I want fast heroics, not heroics to gear people&quot;. One person with lower gear isnt going to slow you down immensley. Then chances are, if you kick the dps...you will get a hunter who will complain that he'd rather have kings than might, go over you in threat and then claim you aren't doing it right. Do you really want that?</div></div><hr />

You have seen the people pulling less than 1.5k dps in epics. Everyone has seen at least one person like that. http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com/2009/08/ungeared.html is my answer to anyone that thinks that gear is everything.

What's there to wonder about? If somebody in the raid has the appropriate quest and if the boss drops a shard, only one person out of all those with the quest can loot it. One raid group is only meant to get 2, maybe 3 Shadowmournes until Cataclysm hits.</div></div><hr />

What it likely yo happen is that it will be a rareish drop, and only one per boss, until closer to the expac and blizz will give more of them, either by making it 100% drop or allowing more than one to loot it.</div></div><hr />

Unless its ToC hc or one of the IC hcs, freshly dinged players have as much right to be in those groups as you do. When i'm doing hcs on my main i dont give a crap what others are wearing as my dps more than makes up for any slack from gearing players.<br />
<br />
On the other hand i've also got a freshy dinged Ele Shammy still wearing some questing blues/greens, some bought blues and one or two hc epics, easily capable of 3k dps.<br />
<br />
So on one of my hc pugs yesterday i got put in a Gundrak hc group, we get to Slad'ran, kill him with the achievment i'm sitting at about 2kish dps as i was curing poison etc. alot but the groups resto druid decided i wasnt good enough to be in his group and pleaded with the other guys stating that &quot;we cant do achievments with low dps&quot; even though i was second on dps after the fight (yes even with 2k dps) ofc i got kicked and saved then.<br />
<br />
Did you people start your chars at level 80?. Anyway i dont see why you people need to have a slightly quicker more achievment packed instance run in a pug, if you're so great and you have great guilds go make an achievment group and do them quicker than you could ever do with a pug. Also if i met someone like your or the resto druid in my post while i was on my main and you tried to pull the same bullshit i'd be voting to kick you over the freshly dinged player.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ohh cool I will make an alt on your realm, sounds like if I have greens, no gems, no enchants you will give me a free ride in any heroic :) , yeah right get real and get off your high horse.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is exactly your problem, you see all freshly dinged players as &quot;looking for a free ride&quot; where someone who isnt a selfish asshat would see the same players as &quot;trying to gear up so they can contribute more to groups&quot;. Sure you get bad and freshy dinged players but you need to judge that on a case by case basis. Ofc when i mean bad i dont mean &quot;questing green without and 200g enchant&quot; but more like &quot;DK doing 200dps, dps'r bodypulling every group etc&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Why haven't I heard of anyone seeing these yet then? According to Armory, even the first four bosses should drop them 25-50% of the time. Seems like they're still acting as Quest Items and not visible until people are on the quest. Either that or my server is just VERY unlucky.</div></div><hr />

Nerf to hasted corruption<br />
I do want to point out one side effect - when we could roll hasted corruption we COULD top the DPS charts - not destroy other classes but we had a chance to reach the #1 spot. I hope this issue will make GC re-asses our lack of damage output.<br />
No, you were destroying the other classes, except for Mutilate rogues and Unholy DKs, who were also nerfed. I think the only difference is that for the rogues and DKs it was easier to do so, while only the better locks could really come out with the great numbers. But being hard to do is no excuse for someone's dps to be gratuitously higher than everyone else.

We were in ToC Regular and our healer shows up wearing no gear. Literally. He had nothing. We got through the joust okay and the tanked who apparently hadn't noticed started the fight. We wiped naturally and the tank immediately leaves.<br />
<br />
When we asked the priest (I think) why he going gearless, he says &quot;My account was hacked.&quot; We offered him a couple of quick suggestions and then kicked him.<br />
<br />
I don't care if people are last in dps, I don't care if they are wearing greens, but if you are going to sign up as the healer or tank, you owe it to the other people in your group to act responsibly and be reasonably prepared.</div></div><hr />

If somebody had seen a shard by now we all would have heard about it. So obviously, you cant see them till you're on that step.<br />
<br />
That step comes after you build Shadow's Edge (25x Primordial Saronite + 2x acidic blood) and after you farm 1000 souls and after you put yourself at risk in 3 special ways while fighting Putricide, Lana'thel and Sindragosa. It's pretty much the last step.<br />
<br />
A lot of people are going to get Shadow's Edge, decidedly fewer will even come close to doing Shadowmourne. And if you look at the questline you'll see very quickly that the quests that reward both Shadow's Edge and Shadowmourne are decidedly thin on text (the former being entirely empty) so I suspect we'll see a patch on the tuesday that Putricide's door opens which fills out those quests and maybe makes building Shadowmourne even harder. For example I wouldn't be surprised to see the 3 special infusions change to require heroic mode.<br />
<br />
The good news is the price of Primordial Saronite is dropping like a rock. First couple were 50k, then 10k, over the weekend it fell past 5k.

<br />
I've seen it both ways. On my druid alt (moderately geared tank, mostly Ulduar and some Ony 10 stuff), I was in an H-CoS group where I was the number 2 DPS. The number 1 had around 2.5 K, and 3 and 4 were both around 1.5 (I came in around 1.8 which is about right for a tank in my gear). We still managed to get the timed run with a minute or two to spare, and the under geared newbies in the group got to roll on a pretty dragon mount. It will seriously not kill anyone to spend an extra 5 minutes on the random heroic. At first I was surprised that the system gave me such a low geared group (it's supposed to match pretty well, and does for my rogue), but I think it's starved for tanks. If you queue as a tank you get groups much faster, but I think we can expect some of them to not be as good. <br />
<br />
On my Rogue (main, pretty well geared, pulls 3.5 to 4K DPS in most five mans) I nearly always get really good, really fast groups. In some ways it is almost annoying. No one talks, there are no breaks, healers sometimes beg for a few seconds to drink. Our healer in one UP group asked 3 times for the tank to stop so he could take care of something real quick IRL. He finally just stopped moving and went to do his thing. It took the tank 3 more pulls to get low enough that he finally had to stop and wait. You could see it practically killing him. Twice now I've actually finished instances with time left on the 10 minute &quot;you can't use the LFG random tool yet&quot; timer. Only a few seconds, but still. <br />
<br />
In these group I've already seen seen two votes to kick (well a few more for DCs and stuff, but two votes to kick a real active player). One was for a DPS who was doing a perfectly respectable 2.5K, and one was for a healer who (gasp!) had to stop and drink once or twice. Both failed (thankfully), but seriously, are people really that impatient? I haven't seen the achievement for &quot;Finish Gun'Drak in Under 9 Minutes&quot;, but apparently there is one and I'm just missing it.</div></div><hr />

Are we even sure of the quest order? I find it a little strange that Blizzard would make you wait until you kill Sindragosa before you begin the long process of collecting 50 shards and then killing 1000 scourge. The patch was released on the 8th of Dec. The next phase will be 4 weeks from the 8th. If we assume a gate of every 2 weeks, it will take 8 weeks just to start the shard collection. Given mmo's predictions, you then tack on 6 weeks for the shards. You then have another week for the 1000 souls. That gives you at least 15 weeks (nearly 4 months) to get your first one. That means the first one will be out at the end of march. That would be like getting your first val'anyr near the start of August. I don't think they are going to make it take twice the time of Val'anyr. (The first val'anyr was recieved June 8, patch 3.1 hit on April 14th. That took 8 weeks).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you look at top dps for deathbringer which top affliction warlocks should stay on the boss for <br />
<br />
The top warlock in the world for that fight is 20 percent behind the top rogue, 10 percent below the top fury, 10 percent below the top unholy dk, 3 percent above the top arcane mage, 6 percent above the top feral, 7 percent above the top hunter and 8 percent above the top ret although i expect that most hunters were kiting and killing adds along with boomkins or eleshammies who wouldnt be top spot competitive.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact the top 200 are almost all mutilate rogues and a 5 percent nerf would keep the top 100 or so rogues pretty far above any other class still.<br />
<br />
With the changes plus the hunter ammo buff i expect warlocks to be below all of those classes in single target dps. I mean destorying means being below fury and within 7 percent of 4 other classes when counting world class single target dps then i guess he is right.</div></div><hr />

Right, as a guild recruting , WE (being the guild) wont be able to tell a fucking newb from a good player because you (blizz) loaded his ass with tons of tier 9 and lowprice epics.. Thanks again Blizzard ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
As with ANY player before 3.3 you tell the noobs from a good player by their ability to listen, learn, and not die in fire. I've seen too many (before 3.3) &quot;geared&quot; players die to Grobulus in Naxx, because they are just bad. So my suggestion to a guild recruiting: go run Naxx, go run some Ulduar, even if its on Farm mode. Because you'll figure out right away which people are the bad ones, and which ones you want to keep.</div></div><hr />

So to get frost emblems you have to do a random heroic. If that wasn't in there then queue times would be 30min to an hour. I'm not even sure how people find doing mindless 5mans 10x a day is fun. But hey if someone wants to spend 15bucks a month to do mindless 5mans I guess it must be fun.</div></div><hr />

Apparently, if you read Wowhead for the quest chain, it shows 1 &quot;Shadow's Edge&quot; quest after the first quest (you get it at friend) rewarding you the 2h axe.<br />
<br />
Just complete that first quest and the weapon is yours, next month when they open the 2nd wing.</div></div><hr />

The only gear restrictions they have in right now are for TOC and the ICC 5 mans. And they're not much, I think anyone with an average of 200-213 ilevel can get in those. The fact is raid geared players WILL dominate whatever charts they're monitoring because the majority of people doing them need the gear and badges more than you do.</div></div><hr />

You can see that it is no longer a quest item, which means only one person is able to get them, and they will NOT have to be on a quest. <br />
<br />
<br />
How come nobody have seen it drop yet if it is like val'anyr fragments?<br />
<br />
Do people actually have to have the quest for it to drop or what?<br />

This is really not clear. Before investing a lot of time farming for primordial saronite I'd love to know how it drops and if it's sharable.</div></div><hr />

There's this thing called taking them on a run and seeing how they do. I hear there are addons called &quot;damage meters&quot; and sites where you upload your logs and look at the data from the run to help you determine who is good and who is fail.<br />
<br />
Gear has nothing to do with who is good and who is fail. Skill does. You can't tell someone's skill from an /inspect. Lrn2trialrun.</div></div><hr />

Do the shards drop for the questgivers only or are they generic boss drops? We've not had any drops on our servers and plenty of guilds have cleared it.

Your question makes it quite clear who the retard is tbh ^^<br />
<br />
As stated in earlier comments on this post, there hasn't been a single drop in the world yet. Which basically means they are only visible to people on the quest, period.</div></div><hr />
