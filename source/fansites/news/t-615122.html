I'd like to bet against you on that one. They're keeping the beta build and the PTR build in sync, which means no feature freeze on the PTR, which means no release any time soon.<br />
<br />
I'd put $10 on 3.0.2 going live Tuesday November 11. That was the original plan with Burning Crusade, the only reason we got to play with 2.0 for a month was because of a last minute delay in BC release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But seriously finally nice that the Beta and PTR will be the same version, was getting confusing haveing like 3 different talent trees lol.</div></div><hr />
