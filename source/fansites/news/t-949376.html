vodka was the first guild to defeat Ragnaros in the US, finally closing the race for the regional first kill of the last challenge of Patch 4.2. Congratulations to them!

As of today, only 6 guilds killed Ragnaros and I think that at this point it's safe to say that it was one of the most challenging bosses we've seen in the past few months/years.

Diablo 3 Beta Announcement<br />
No date yet, except that we kinda know that the beta is supposed to start mid august. However, there's an official page/FAQ with beta information that you might want to read, along with an official recap of the Auction House. <br />
Countless hours of consulting the ancient prophecies and poring over dusty tomes have resulted in the unearthing of new information about Diablo III. The upcoming Diablo III beta test will introduce a treasure trove of exciting new features, including a new Auction House that will provide a powerful new way for your characters to acquire the implements of war. Prepare yourselves!<br />

Blizzard also released extra screenshots of the AH on the Auction House Overview Page (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/events/diablo3-announcement/#auction:auction-summary), including 3 screenshots of the characters selling/buying panel. (Fairly low resolution, if you know where to find higher quality screenshots please post about it in comments)<br />

<br />
Auction House API is live!<br />
If you're developing tools for World of Warcraft, you will most likely enjoy this news. If you're not, just skip it, it's developer mumbo jumbo talk. <br />
We're very pleased to announce that the first version of the Auction House API is now live - we have been hard at work on this for the last few weeks, and are looking forward to seeing what new and exciting applications spawn out of it!<br />
<br />
As of right now, US and Europe are live and populating, and Korea will be following in a couple of days.<br />
<br />
Please refer to the documentation at http://blizzard.github.com/api-wow-docs/#id3683980 for further information, and don't hesitate to post any thoughts on this thread.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience!<br />

It's the future of gaming. I bet over a couple of yours, it'll be perfectly normal to trade through video games using real money, maybe even to the point where professional gamers can make a living out of it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chupathingy</div><div class="date">2011-08-02, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it does show characters being sold for real money, but if they are I'm pretty much done with d3 before it even started</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simca</div><div class="date">2011-08-02, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Character selling/buying is extremely common - people who quit don't care about getting banned and buyers don't have to worry about their main account getting banned so it is relatively safe.<br />
<br />
I guess a lot of the shift we're seeing is because of new games like League of Legends that are based on similar systems. They are HUGELY successful (seriously, LoL is enjoying HUGE growth atm - far beyond WoW and SC2) and older companies look to their systems for future endeavors. As the companies based on different principles (i.e. Blizzard) advance forward, they adopt similar features (i.e. Real ID on forums, Blizzard Pet Store, and Diablo 3 AH) and it causes a massive backlash from fans who want things to be the same and want their eternal love to perpetually fill Blizzard's coffers.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that doesn't work, and companies have to change (or do they?).<br />
<br />
Edit: As for all the people not going to buy it: Why not just buy it and play it with your real life friends or WoW friends? That's what I'm doing. I'm not going to play with random strangers (the people who would use these systems) anyway...<br />
<br />
It's not an MMO - you get to pick who you play with.</div></div><hr />

Well it will end that way, premium service this premium service that, im still waiting for the announcement of $25 for moving BoA's to different realms, nothing surprises me anymore.</div></div><hr />

There is no Single Player so and no mods also. No extra content for this game.<br />
And can only be played online ;)</div></div><hr />

Why?<br />
Because I do not want to support Blizzard by paying for game which is endorsing such things as selling items and characters for real money.<br />
I had 2 copes of D2, play WoW, have SC2.<br />
But, D3 is where I draw the line... while I really wanted to play it and buy it, this will just make me get torrent of it, and play cracked version.<br />
When this reaches WoW too (matter of time), at least this will be enough to make me stop play that too.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't count on that seeing as you have to be online 100% of the time to play it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ehhm yes there is a single player option, and the 100% online time will most likely be circumvented in some way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because scammers and toads mess up the game doesn´t all of a sudden make it ok for Blizz to the same. Why don´t they just start selling gold, chars and hell world firsts in wow also. The idea that a persons irl financial situation should be able to give him an ingame advantage is downright retarded and also destructive towards &quot;fairness&quot; and any and all sense of personal achievement in a game.<br />
Instead of being greedy twats Blizzard could invest some of their massive capitol into safeguards against such crap, but it seems they would rather make an ekstra buck than actually do anything about shit like this.</div></div><hr />

Ubisoft tried this with Assassins Creed II.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LanceDH</div><div class="date">2011-08-02, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 FAQS that I think are worth pointing out: <br />
<br />
How will the currency-based auction house work?<br />
<br />
Players will be able to make purchases in the currency-based auction house using a registered form of payment attached to their Battle.net account. As with other popular online-purchase services, players will also have the option to charge up their Battle.net account with a balance of funds that can be drawn from for purchases of any digital product available through Battle.net -- this includes not only auction house items but also things like World of Warcraft subscription time and paid services, to name a few examples. On the flipside, when players sell an item in the currency-based auction house, the proceeds of the sale are deposited into their Battle.net account and can then be used as described above. Note that this process might be different for certain regions; we’ll provide further region-specific details as we get closer to launch. <br />
<br />
<br />
Can players choose to get cash from currency-based auction house sales, instead of having the proceeds deposited into their Battle.net account?<br />
<br />
 Yes, as an advanced feature, players will have the option of attaching an account with an approved third-party payment service to their Battle.net account. Once this has been completed, proceeds from the sale of items in the currency-based auction house can be deposited into their third-party payment service account. “Cashing out” would then be handled through the third-party payment service. Note that this process will be subject to applicable fees charged by Blizzard and the third-party payment service. Also, any proceeds from the sale of items in the currency-based auction house that have been deposited into the Battle.net account will not be transferrable to the third-party payment service account. Not all regions will support this advanced feature at launch. Region-specific details, as well as details regarding which third-party payment services will be supported and the fee that Blizzard will charge for the cash-out process, will all be provided at a later date.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragonwing</div><div class="date">2011-08-02, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why?<br />
Because I do not want to support Blizzard by paying for game which is endorsing such things as selling items and characters for real money.<br />
I had 2 copes of D2, play WoW, have SC2.<br />
But, D3 is where I draw the line... while I really wanted to play it and buy it, this will just make me get torrent of it, and play cracked version.<br />
When this reaches WoW too (matter of time), at least this will be enough to make me stop play that too.<br />
<br />
It is really sad when people feel the need to stop playing a game they like in order to make a 'statement'.</div></div><hr />

They took ideas found in other free to play games and added to a subscription based (WoW) and a full pay (D3) game. Is it morally wrong for them to do it? Of course it is! Will it pave a new movement in the gaming industry? Of course it will. Why because everyone is just going to take it up the backside just because it’s Blizzard. Blizzard has proven to the rest of the industry that if you condition customers, you can get away with anything. This is Blizzard’s business model. And with the responses I have read here in the last few days, it’s a jackpot. Please stop being a lemming and realize that this is just the beginning. That more companies will start doing this spreading like wildfire to other parts of the gaming industry. Look at EA, a $5 deposit on a digital game that does not go to the purchase price of the actual game… I mean really! So unless you own stock in either Activision or Blizzard, this is not good customer practice. Sound business model, horrendous customer model.</div></div><hr />

How the hell is it morally wrong to allow people to earn some money off of a game they love to play? Hell, how is this even a moral issue? You're not buying stuff from Blizzard, you're buying stuff from other players. Do you appose the regular AH since you can pay to win through that as well? People have done this for years through seedy sites and people have lost money and had their identities stolen. Blizzard just said, &quot;Hold on sonny Jim, don't go losing all your life savings on that random back alley site.

<br />
How is this morally wrong? Let’s see you take a model that up to 6-12 months ago only existed in Free to play games and add a full retail value to it and subscription. Knowing full well that this model works in an environment where you do not pay full price first then milk your customer base with items that will have a direct effect on said game. They know this, I hope you realize this as well. They know it goes against the moral standards that are inherited into the current model of free to play. And they went ahead and institute it into their full retail game model to maximize profit. It’s pretty simple. Whether you disagree with moral conduct in this regard or not it’s your personal choice. <br />
But I see it as a cash-grab with disregards to their fateful (often blind) fan base. And please keep in mind that this is just one door of many paths that we will see unfolding in the years to come.</div></div><hr />

I will apologize of hand if this comes across as rude. But you are very naive if you think this will have any kind of effect on that. They can’t control the third-party stuff that goes on in their games. I Understand. Solution: Join them and disregard it all together for the time being. And yes, no-one has seen this function in action. But to say that it will not have a direct effect on the actual game is beyond my comprehension. Blizzard put that into the game, so it’s a big part of it. In the end, this is not the end all be all practice. This is just the continuation of things that because people let them, will lead to something even bigger than this. What that will be?

I think when presented with a legitimate option, and an illegitimate option, most people will choose the legitimate one. The previous methods of obtaining those items could include giving away logins/passwords to less than reputable people, or going to potentially virused websites. Giving an incentive not to visit these websites definitely will help cut down on hacked accounts, as people won't have to go to potentially dangerous means to acquire items they would have otherwise acquired that way. Since that is a major source of hacked accounts, that number should go down.<br />
<br />
I think your comparison of free to play economy is slightly off as well; in almost all cases, you are comparing the parent company for free to play games selling items in an &quot;item shop&quot;, whereas Blizzard has taken the stance of never doing so. If they did decide to start selling items, I'd be rather irritated as well; however this is simply players interacting with other players with Blizzard acting as moderator, as they always have. They also have only decided to take a cut of the &quot;action&quot; for those who are using the &quot;real money AH&quot; to some considerable amount; ie. those that are &quot;power sellers&quot; and play the AH. Considering how much additional support it's going to cost to implement this, I'd say it's a pretty fair trade off.<br />
<br />
And as has been repeated many times over the last few days, the slippery slope argument is a logical fallacy. As Blizzard has changed and reversed their stance many times in the past, there's no telling what their direction will be... and arguing that it will continue down a particular path is speculation at best.</div></div><hr />

So you don't think by greatly diminishing, if not eliminating, gold selling websites that Blizzard is lowering the chances of people making phishing sites to steal people's information?<br />
<br />
Honestly, if people don't want to take part in the real world currency part of D3, then don't. If you don't like the fact that there's an AH, don't use it. There's ways around these issues that do not involve whining about them. (Not directed at you, just people in general)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Diminish? Maybe, eliminating it? Highly doubtful. What will happen is that the gold-selling/phishing sites will adapt to the new rule set and circumvent the system like it always happens. Just like you or I can sit there and farm for a certain drop, so will they in a more efficient manner. With more people available to manipulate the system that now legitimizes the gold selling/ item selling in game (referring to the gold-selling/phishing industry). But I digress, I won’t tip my hat to Blizzard for implementing a function and dipping into it numerous times for greed’s sake and making out to be the &quot;We do it because we care&quot; statement they offered. And I do understand the argument of “You don’t have to use it if you don’t want too”. Not were my concern lay, but what this will lead to.</div></div><hr />

They also have only decided to take a cut of the &quot;action&quot; for those who are using the &quot;real money AH&quot; to some considerable amount; ie. those that are &quot;power sellers&quot; and play the AH. Considering how much additional support it's going to cost to implement this, I'd say it's a pretty fair trade off.<br />
<br />
And as has been repeated many times over the last few days, the slippery slope argument is a logical fallacy. As Blizzard has changed and reversed their stance many times in the past, there's no telling what their direction will be... and arguing that it will continue down a particular path is speculation at best.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is where this will eventually lead to? Whether you think so or not, that is the logical next step in this business model. Once Blizzard sees the money they generate just from transactions that they do not initiate. What is to stop them from adding &quot;vanity/premium items&quot; to the game in order to maximize the monetary gain? Not a thing since the player base is ok with the issue as long as they can get a “piece”. Or maybe I am wrong and this may well revolutionize the gaming industry all together for the better. Who knows, but I do thank MMO champion’s user base for intelligent arguments.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">themortalgod</div><div class="date">2011-08-02, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is this morally wrong? Let’s see you take a model that up to 6-12 months ago only existed in Free to play games and add a full retail value to it and subscription. Knowing full well that this model works in an environment where you do not pay full price first then milk your customer base with items that will have a direct effect on said game. They know this, I hope you realize this as well. They know it goes against the moral standards that are inherited into the current model of free to play. And they went ahead and institute it into their full retail game model to maximize profit. It’s pretty simple. Whether you disagree with moral conduct in this regard or not it’s your personal choice. <br />
But I see it as a cash-grab with disregards to their fateful (often blind) fan base. And please keep in mind that this is just one door of many paths that we will see unfolding in the years to come. <br />
<br />
fateful? (or faithful?)<br />
<br />
I think you heavily misread into the nature of ethical behavior. Especially in business. A leader of a company is morally obligated to maximize profits. Their chief responsibility is to share holders, not customers. Many business leaders even believe this responsibility is so strong that it is morally acceptable to engage in socially immoral practice so long as you remain responsible to this mandate.<br />
<br />
The reality is simple the cost of developing a game like Diablo 3 is astronomical in comparison to say Diablo 2. Furthermore the profit margin that a single retail sale provides in contrast to say WoW Subscriptions is so minuscule that creating a game like Diablo 3 becomes trivial and wasteful from a business point of view. Thus Blizzard was forced to come up with another source of income. (Note: they plan to do the same with Starcraft 2 via the map store)<br />
<br />
All that said their solution for this I feel is far more elegant than other company's pay to progress models as they aren't just creating a system where they have a license to print money. Instead, they give the players a venue to choose how they wish to play, whether it will cost them money, make them money, or be monetarily neutral. Furthermore they have created a stream of revenue for themselves that will give them incentive to continually add new content and items to the game as that will lead to more auction house sales and more income for Blizzard. Thus because of this I imagine we will see content updates much like WoW without the monthly subscription. <br />
<br />
In all, however, there is nothing morally wrong about their move. From both a business and social viewpoint they are creating a system that will earn them more income that will at the same time be giving the players the freedom to play how they like best. Some players don't want to spend 8 hours/day magic find farming, others do. Both will have incentives to play the way they like and outlets to allow them to thrive in that environment.<br />
<br />
Just because other companies have done it differently before Blizzard doesn't make Blizzard corrupt for changing the model. Are Apple and Google also immoral for charging for their mobile devices then charging for the apps as well? If Blizzard had announced the game would be free but they would be selling weapons and armor themselves I would not have played Diablo 3. However, this slightly different approach not only intrigues me but seems like a much better solution.<br />
<br />
Also to close, if you compare the longevity of Blizzard games to competitors they are by far the most cost effective form of entertainment there is. Some players have been playing sc1 or D2 for a decade on the original $100 cost for game and expand. Even playing soccer/football outside would have costed more just on the cost of replacing your soccer ball and running shoes several times over the last decade.</div></div><hr />

When/if this continue, and regards what many say, going to be a succes, and people start earn alot of money, is it then considered as a job where you have to pay tax from? In most country's if you earn more than X money you have to pay tax, if you on social care you would losethat or get redused in payment, and if you just dont mention it to the right places you risk going to jail for cheating state. So how can this be legal? Im pretty sure noone think of the consequences of this, they just YAY i can get rich by doing this. If you win in Lotto/other games you pay some % of your win to the state, and the compagny that have the game running is oblicated to inform the state too. So if you sell for say 1000$ in game is blizzard oblicated to infomt the state too? Or can they just ignore it? I would check all this before doing this, if I where you.</div></div><hr />

How the hell is it morally wrong to allow people to earn some money off of a game they love to play? Hell, how is this even a moral issue? You're not buying stuff from Blizzard, you're buying stuff from other players. Do you appose the regular AH since you can pay to win through that as well? People have done this for years through seedy sites and people have lost money and had their identities stolen. Blizzard just said, &quot;Hold on sonny Jim, don't go losing all your life savings on that random back alley site. If you want to waste real life money on pixels, we are giving you a safe place to do it in&quot;.<br />

Solution: Join them and disregard it all together for the time being. And yes, no-one has seen this function in action. But to say that it will not have a direct effect on the actual game is beyond my comprehension. Blizzard put that into the game, so it’s a big part of it. In the end, this is not the end all be all practice. This is just the continuation of things that because people let them, will lead to something even bigger than this. What that will be? Who knows, but we will find out soon enough at this rate.<br />
<br />
Things like you can't give (or sold like ppl love making money with games here) your old game to someone else because the company feels that they need to receive the $$ spent on it again the let it be fully functional AGAIN instead of a chopped off version that was alread paid before???<br />

<br />
Very simple, right now Blizzard is alread counting all the their profit with the game as &quot;people who will just buy it = normal profit&quot; + &quot;people who will buy it and pay us more using our AH = normal profit + extra&quot;.<br />
<br />
Right now they're not acknowledging the option &quot;people won't buy it because our behavior is unaceptable&quot;.<br />
<br />
So yes, the most efective way to make a &quot;statement&quot; is not buying it. Do whatever you want. Forget about it, torrent it, play other games... but don't buy it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you read what Paragon wrote about the boss, it took them over 500 wipes to get the kill. Wrap your head around that number. They took 500 attempts at a boss that lasts 15+ minutes in two weeks time. Imagine if they held a normal work week and maintained a 3-4 hour raid night. How long would the boss take to kill then? At best, you can get in 15 wipes an hour and that number goes down the further you get into the fight. That is a lot of time spent on one encounter. As far as I can remember, no boss took them that many wipes to get down, not even H LK or Alone in the Darkness.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, when the people who have actually killed a fight say it is the hardest fight that has been in the game in a very, VERY long time, I'd value their opinion over some anonymous person bitching on a forum about things he/she has yet to do. Then again, I am an elitist asshole.<br />

Also, before I forget to re-address this...Blizzard isn't selling items to anyone, PLAYERS are selling gear to other PLAYERS. In a technical sense, they still haven't changed their policies or lied to anyone, people just don't want to admit that this is the same thing as an already existing auction house...it just uses a different currency. Is trading Pokemon to get them to evolve unfair since it is unobtainable to those players who don't trade? Is buying a Darkmoon Card: Volcano from a scribe unfair to all those people who are either not scribes or don't have the gold to buy it? Shit no, D3 is not a MMO like WoW, so their models on pricing and playability do not coincide. Grow the fuck up and l2business.</div></div><hr />

All that said their solution for this I feel is far more elegant than other company's pay to progress models as they aren't just creating a system where they have a license to print money. Instead, they give the players a venue to choose how they wish to play, whether it will cost them money, make them money, or be monetarily neutral. Furthermore they have created a stream of revenue for themselves that will give them incentive to continually add new content and items to the game as that will lead to more auction house sales and more income for Blizzard.

If Apple and Google charged you for every time you called someone who didn’t have either an Iphone or Nexus phone would you use it? Would you be ok with getting a charge for say sending your business card to a colleague via Bluetooth or email on top of whatever you pay on a monthly plan? The fact that they charge for additional apps doesn’t deter people from using it as a cell phone, which is the primary use for it. I completely grasp the business mechanics in play. I did state that this is a great business model that they are building. And yes the company’s loyalty is with share/stock holders not consumers. But at what point will you/I/anyone stop and say &quot;Ok they are going a little too far with this&quot;. Leading innovation is always good. A company stating that they “will never” do a certain thing and then condone it on the other end is wrong. And again, this is just the push that will set everything else into motion.</div></div><hr />

If some rich guys are willing to pay money to probably poor ones because they provide gold or items to increase their childish e-peen so be it. I don't believe it will change much and if rich guys go around in unique items feeling pretty so be it (just like it is already on D2 or F2P games), I'm going to play with friends anyway and D3 has little to none real competitive aspect anyway.

When I'm comparing to the amount of time spent on a single boss, not an entire damn instance, you bet your sweet ass I can. H LK took them 100-200 or so wipes ON HIM, he only lasted as long as he did due to the limited attempts. If those were gone, H LK would have been killed in a day. Try as hard as you want to lessen the fact that Paragon has said that Ragnaros is the hardest boss battle Blizzard has made in years, but seriously, stop trying to make it seem like Firelands is a joke. Seven guilds have cleared it. SEVEN, out of 23,000+ registered guilds. I'd say that's a pretty damn challenging and successful raid.<br />

When you're in business, you only care about ethics and legality.

Though, to get a bit semantic here... &quot;the discipline dealing with what is good and bad and with moral duty and obligation&quot;, that's the first definition of ethics. So...if they are acting ethically, they are being moral. It's not like Blizzard is bending you over, violating your posterior, then clapping while you give them more money. They are offering a service that one may or may not participate in parallel to another identical feature which no one has qualms with. Grow up and welcome to the real world.</div></div><hr />

So...if they are acting ethically, they are being moral.But we're not talking about &quot;ethics&quot; and &quot;morals&quot; without context. We're talking about business ethics and personal/societal morals. Those are not the same. Use the words interchangeably if you want, but what's ethical from a business's standpoint isn't necessarily moral from a personal or societal standpoint. As you said, all a business cares about is not violating legal rules; all an officer/director cares about is not violating legal or ethical rules (or more honestly: not getting caught).<br />
<br />
When Poster A says, &quot;Company X acted immorally when they decided to charge 1000x more for a service than it actually cost Company X.&quot;<br />
A response that, &quot;Company X isn't violating any laws or established ethical rules,&quot; completely misses the point. Poster A isn't evaluating Company X's behavior on legal or ethical rules of business, but on personal or societal morals. <br />
<br />

It's not like Blizzard is bending you over, violating your posterior, then clapping while you give them more money. They are offering a service that one may or may not participate in parallel to another identical feature which no one has qualms with. Grow up and welcome to the real world.Sigh. You grow up. Silly exaggerations that that do not aid in any serious discussion. As you so eloquently put above, companies will do virtually anything to maximize profits, provided it doesn't lead to prosecution or a director/officer getting caught in a serious ethics violation. That means that Blizzard has a duty (ethical, moral, whatever) to keep adding more and more ways to get money from its customers. If dissatisfied customers don't express their dissatisfaction to Blizzard, then Blizzard has no reason to slow down or stop this practice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menegroth</div><div class="date">2011-08-02, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is this morally wrong? Let’s see you take a model that up to 6-12 months ago only existed in Free to play games and add a full retail value to it and subscription. Knowing full well that this model works in an environment where you do not pay full price first then milk your customer base with items that will have a direct effect on said game. They know this, I hope you realize this as well. They know it goes against the moral standards that are inherited into the current model of free to play. And they went ahead and institute it into their full retail game model to maximize profit. It’s pretty simple. Whether you disagree with moral conduct in this regard or not it’s your personal choice. <br />
But I see it as a cash-grab with disregards to their fateful (often blind) fan base. And please keep in mind that this is just one door of many paths that we will see unfolding in the years to come. <br />
<br />
Except D3 DOES NOT have a subscription fee. Also this model DID NOT EXIST IN F2P games. F2P games have had a micro-transaction method, where you buy in-game items directly from the developer. As in, they were NOT found in the game, and are NOT being sold by other players. This simply allows for the items that players dig up in game to be traded to other players for real world cash. With some feed associated for some profit, as well as a need for fees in any auction based system.<br />
<br />
You really don't know what you're talking about do you? Just blindly bashing anything that blizzard could potentially make a profit on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This, 1000x this.<br />
<br />
Also, I like Valve's method of in game purchasing with TF2. Bought items are permanently marked (and untradeable), letting people clearly see the difference between someone who has &quot;earned&quot; the item and someone who simply shelled out some cash. D3's system is is different, but shares some similarities, and I would hope that there in fact is some kind of negative impact to buying an item over getting it yourself. This won't happen of course....<br />
<br />
Lastly, I fear that every 6 months we'll have a mini-gear-reset (ala wow) where the &quot;super awesome proc ring&quot; or whatever will suddenly be nerfed to make the &quot;NEW super awesome proc necklace&quot; more attractive. Or random mechanic/balance changes, or huge changes to stats &quot;because we didn't expect players to scale like this, even though we created this entire game and knew exactly what we were making from the start but still think the consumers are idiots and will believe this bullshit excuse as a real one so we have a reason for you to play/buy our latest greatest&quot;.<br />

Well guess what you still have to pay blizzard for putting up that unsold item that was under cut by $0.01-0.50.<br />
<br />
As far as i know the second 2 &quot;cuts&quot; are one and the same (wouldnae quote me on that), and you get a certain amount of free AH posts per week per account.<br />

If Apple and Google charged you for every time you called someone who didn’t have either an Iphone or Nexus phone would you use it? Would you be ok with getting a charge for say sending your business card to a colleague via Bluetooth or email on top of whatever you pay on a monthly plan? The fact that they charge for additional apps doesn’t deter people from using it as a cell phone, which is the primary use for it. I completely grasp the business mechanics in play. I did state that this is a great business model that they are building. And yes the company’s loyalty is with share/stock holders not consumers. But at what point will you/I/anyone stop and say &quot;Ok they are going a little too far with this&quot;. Leading innovation is always good. A company stating that they “will never” do a certain thing and then condone it on the other end is wrong. And again, this is just the push that will set everything else into motion.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure they said they would never sell anything that would give an ingame advantage. I feel like bolding and cap'sing the next part.<br />
They are not selling these items, anything that is buyable has to be crafted or found by another player. I've seen a lot of posts concerning this and I'm assuming none of said posters understand the loot system from the diablo series or may never have played it. If i have picked you up wrong on your intent I apologize.<br />
<br />
PS. On a side note they are taking the power from farming sites and putting it into the players hands. So long D2jsp.</div></div><hr />
