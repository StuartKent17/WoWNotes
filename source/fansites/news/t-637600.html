Overhead Smash (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=64003) - The not so massive attack Inflicts Physical damage and decreases armor by 25% for 30 sec.<br />
Petrifying Breath (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63980) - Inflicts 18750 to 21250 Nature damage every 1 sec and increases damage taken by 20% for 8 sec. (Brittle Skin (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62055) - Increases damage taken by 20% for 8 sec.)<br />

Ulduar - General Vezax Testing<br />
The testing of General Vezax is now finished on EU PTRs, Ensidia (http://www.ensidia.com/) killed him in both normal and hard mode in 25-man and received a bunch of new items. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/generalvezax_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/generalvezax.jpg)<br />
<br />
Abilities<br />
Health - 30M (25-Man) / 7.7M (10-Man)<br />
Shadow Crash (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63277) - Fires a shadow missile at a target, dealing 11310 to 12690 Shadow damage to all enemies near the impact point and knocking them away. After impact, leaves an energy field that lingers for 20 sec, increasing magical damage dealt by 50%, reducing healing done by 50%, and reducing mana costs by 30%. (10-Man (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=60833) - 5655-6345 damage)<br />
Searing Flames (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62661) - Deals 13875 to 16125 Fire damage to all enemies within 100 yards, superheating their armor and reducing its ability to protect them by 75% for 10 sec. (2 sec cast time, interruptable)<br />
Surge of Darkness (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62662) - Empowers the caster with dark might, increasing physical damage by 100% but reducing movement speed by 50%, for 10 sec. (Self buff on Vezax, you have to kite him around the room while the buff is up, lasts 10 seconds)<br />
Aura of Despair (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62692) (Prevents mana regeneration from nearly all natural sources. Aspect of the Viper, Judgements of the Wise, Shamanistic Rage, and Spiritual Attunement remain at least partially effective. Also reduces melee attack speed by 20%.) is active throughout the whole fight, the only &quot;normal&quot; way to regain mana is to use potions. You can also destroy the crystals flying in the room, they will drop a green cloud on the ground and will restore your mana, they will also damage you for an equal amount of health points (1000 Mana regen = 1000 Damage), this buff stacks and will regen more and more mana (and deal more damage as well) over time. The hard mode version of the encounter require you to not use these clouds<br />
After Vezax spawns the 8th crystal, he will also spawn an add with 8M HP (25-Man) / 2.3M HP (10-Man). This add will repeatedly cast Profound Darkness (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63420) (Inflicts 500 damage to all enemies, and increases Shadow damage taken by 10% per application. Stacks up to 99.) and stack it on the raid, 20 debuffs means you will get 200% more damage from shadow spells (including Shadow Crash missiles from Vezax) <br />

And you get your challenge from doing the Hard Modes. They're not as hard as 25 man, so you don't get a legendary. Capiche?</div></div><hr />

READING THE POST IS HARD. They are placeholders. <br />
<br />
Also blues already said 10 man sarth 3drake is the exception where 10 man hard modes are harder than 25 man hardmodes, they aren't meant to be and that was an oversight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
this is true, however without seeing the rest of the loot, we can't be sure whether is is going to be one of those item's that's considered a weapon for hunters, that's still viable for the plate classes to use because the better ones haven't dropped or there's too much competition for them. with a 3.4 speed, i'm hoping this really is the bottom of the barrel, in terms of both damage and stats (in the eyes of plate classes)</div></div><hr />

It seems to be account bound.. which is strange.<br />
<br />
after you get the disk you go to the room behind the council and access an event...then you get another quest..for which you need to kill Thorim-Hodir-Freya and Mimiron in hard mode to get a sigil from each one.AFter you have all 4 sigils you open the door to ALGALON THE RAID DESTROYER TEAR QQQ EATER bwahahhaa &gt;:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As someone who has done both the 10 and 25 man content from right now, I can say that the 10 man content, not just sarth 3D, is harder except for a few select bosses (KT, Thaddius). Honestly, I don't know why 25 man Naxx drops better loot than 10 man. It should just drop more loot, except maybe KT. 25 man is just undertuned with respect to 10 man right now. If they're going to make Val'anyr fragments drop only in 25 man, they better be a LOT harder.</div></div><hr />

Look at the Idol that dropped. Identical to the Naxx25 drop and the new one is ilvl 226. I want to say all of these items are placeholders (graphically and statwise), but that's not the case.<br />
<br />
35minutes. &quot;Best&quot; guild in the world and all, but the boss probably took 10 minutes to kill. Wouldn't be surprised if Ensidia got a brief on all the bosses so they can plan ahead so Blizz has a team that will run the boss to the end.

<br />
Note on loot - Most of the models here are placeholders, for Ulduar weapon models please check this post. Also, some of these items don't have their own stats yet and will show up with the same stats as the Naxxramas version of the item, just wait for the next patch and they will most likely be updated.<br />

Possibly for testing... to make sure it's dropping correctly, instead of spontaneously crashing WoW for everybody upon looting. Hence... testing realm.</div></div><hr />

Yeh, but take a look at the tactics, it's a kite-phase style boss like Supremous / Buru, with a few survivable, and avoidable AoEs. The hard mode being to kill it before healers go OOM. Probably needs more HP if it goes down so easy though.</div></div><hr />

Too bad he means the Blizz takes wepons like for instance, (Armageddon), renames it and changes stats to such patches and new content.<br />
I agree with him, i am getting tired of paying for a game when they are that lazy to come up with new skins for gear/weapons.<br />
It is annoying, if they are running out of ideas it sounds like they need to find new graphic designers...Thats why im going play Darkfall when it comes out. Blizz has been failing it up since mid-BC!</div></div><hr />

THE MODELS ARE PLACEHOLDERS!!!!!! Why do people not get this? Same with a number of items being the SAME items that drop in naxx with a new name and item level. This is for TESTING purposes. Also note that because this is for TESTING that bosses are intentionally UNDER tuned so that more and more raid groups can down it to make sure that all the abilities are working correctly. Thus they might not hit as hard or have as much health as they will on live. This is to test the abilities, the graphics, the system etc, not something that is on live. Some of you just need to take your head out your ass and read and, and i know this is a stretch, THINK.<br />

They are placeholder drops. These drops you will see with the same name and item level for sure but they will have a different set of stats on them. Right now they have the same stats as other items because those items are already cached in the server so it makes the items less unstable, because the last thing you want is looting crashing a server. Another possibility is they have these stats because they don't want anyone knowing all the loot yet. This is hte most likely. The items that ARE the exact same as naxx items are simply placeholders as has been stated, and I guarantee you 100% they will be the same item name and level but with different abilities on them. Think about it.</div></div><hr />

Again no nonset hitarmor for eleshaman and the spell dd trinket is a copy of the one sapphiron drops. They should stop making trinkets that can only proc of dots.<br />
Slow 2handers (3.6 or slower and not crappy looking like this naxx25 mace) would be nice too.<br />
<br />
Maybe the trinket will be changed, but i dont believe in hitgear for my ele...<br />

Since you haven't seen the new models or stats yet, you really have zero idea whether anything you wrote will be true or not on live. Here's a tip: read the thread before writing your post. That way, even if you don't catch every detail in the article, you won't be the 40th dumbass to complain about the same stats on the items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Noblegarden, now on the ptr, have his own meta and by completing all the achievements of the said event, you get the title: The Noble and this time the Achievement is a FoS not like all the other events achievements. That said, they added the Noblegarden meta to &quot;What a long, strange trip it's been&quot;.<br />

Good to know, but shouldn't largely affect the people who will have the Violet Drake. Noble Garden is later on in the year, so no one's missed it yet.<br />
<br />
Noble Garden is only a single day currently on the Calendar though (Sunday April 12th). I assume they're going to extend the duration??? <br />

LOL @ the constant &quot;OMG SAME MODELS AS NAXX, I QUIT!!!111&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't even bother putting links to placeholder models, and especially placeholder stats. Just makes the retards go apeshit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where the heck are the healing 1h weapons, tho! And the shields?! :(<br />
<br />
I know, I know, testing isn't done. Maybe none of have dropped yet. But still, it's sad-making for a Holy Paladin not to see any possible upgrades yet. There's barely any spellpower+crit plate yet, either. Boo.<br />
<br />
WTB the actual weapon models! Some of these sound like they'll look awesome from the names.</div></div><hr />

OR, if you'd read the post, you'd notice that the models and stats are PLACEHOLDERS. This has been said so many times my head hurts.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mushin</div><div class="date">2009-03-09, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to remind that it's said that &quot;MOST of models are placeholders&quot;, wich is a little bit diferent than &quot;ALL the models&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
::) The models which do not use the previously revealed Ulduar weapon models are clearly placeholders, because they do not fit the thematic graphics of the dungeon and many of those Ulduar weapon models do not appear to be linked to any current loot.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fizyx</div><div class="date">2009-03-09, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Back on topic: I'm wondering about the accuracy of the note that states that the Flame Leviathan vehicles are based off ilevel and NOT stats (or unbuffed stats). I ask this because I was on the PTR fooling around with the vehicles on the first day that the Flame Leviathan was unlocked, and I noticed two things. First, the warlock and I, who have decently similar health pools, had similar health stats on the motorcycle. Second, our tank, who has a good 10k more hp un-buffed than I do, had more than 300k more hp on the siege engine then I did (I had about 500k, he had about 800k). All of us have the same general level of gear (most best in slot with assorted pieces we were waiting on), and the average ilevel of my gear was actually a decent bit ABOVE that of the tank. Maybe this was a bug, but if not, I get the strong feeling that the scaling is NOT ilevel related... anyone else have any imput?</div></div><hr />

I can hardly find caster items without mp5 or spirit. I hope for the other bosses becuase I don't want to wear healer gear as an elemental shaman. 8)</div></div><hr />
