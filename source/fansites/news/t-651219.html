Weekly Wintergrasp quests reset<br />

Non-mana users can't buff before the start of an Arena match<br />
It's a bug and seems to affect non-mana users. If the rogues would start buffing people they'd probably notice too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17615561454-unessecary-stealth-warrior-arena-nerf-.html))<br />

Classes Q&amp;A Sessions<br />
Yes I think there is some confusion here. Nobody from any Community team is assigned to just one particular class. We monitor the forums of all classes, and collect feedback from all classes too.<br />
<br />
In the case of our current Class Q&amp;A series, we are collecting questions from all classes across every WoW region in the world, and sending them through to our developers to be answered. We're not making major edits to the questions, so they are being sent pretty much as they are (as long as they are actual questions and not veiled suggestions! So don't worry, we don't necessarily need to be an expert in your class to collect your questions. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/9521372829-the-us-shaman-forum.html))<br />

Skin tones and Bear/Cat Forms<br />
Based on the current looks of tauren, I believe there are a total of 19 different skin choices for male tauren, and 11 skin choices for tauren females. Many similar tones will share the same bear and cat forms though. We're looking to release a break down of the tauren skin tones and night elf hair colors, as they correspond with the different cat and bear form color options, shortly after the new night elf cat form art is released. <br />
<br />
[...] Some of the skin tones and hair colors share the same forms, so while there are 19 male tauren skin tones, 11 female tauren skin tones, and 8 night elf hair colors, the total number of form color combinations is very close amongst them.

Healing as a Paladin<br />
This topic has strayed a little bit from &quot;Why are there healing niches?&quot; to &quot;I am a paladin healer and I hate my class.&quot;<br />
<br />
Look, we get that....<br />
1) Stacking mostly Int isn't fun.<br />
2) Having 70%+ overheal isn't fun.<br />
3) Focusing so much on the main tank in a raid isn't fun.<br />
4) Casting nothing but Holy Light isn't fun.<br />
<br />
We do have some ideas for how to fix these problems. They aren't redesign-the-class level because frankly we don't think the class needs that, but the proposed changes would fix the above four problems. Understand though that part of reducing overhealing and being a more flexible raid healer might come with regen or mana pool nerfs. It is possible that the only thing keeping Holy paladins from being too good right now is their narrow focus.

We hope to have the combined global Shaman Q&amp;A posted within a week or so. Because we are trying to ensure this is posted in all regions at the same time, multiple translations have to be made and there's been a lot of questions submitted, so it's not a super fast process unfortunately, but it is being done this way with good intent.

<br />
I did have to chuckle a little about &quot;Int stacking is not fun&quot;... well... why? The class that was the least affected by the mana reg nerfs is now complaining about the color of their gems???<br />
<br />
Edit: And I'm 100% sure that once the 70% overheal &quot;problem&quot; is addressed, they will whine about not doing 20k healcrits any more :)</div></div><hr />

- How come they got this achievement on a Freya kill and not on a Yogg kill? To be able to enter Gen V/Yogg's rooms, don't you have to kill all the keepers to unlock the door? Thus they still have to kill Gen V and Yogg without any deaths to receive the title.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RoboStac</div><div class="date">2009-06-04, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The achievement is done per boss, and doesn't reset. So each week you have one chance per boss to get the credit for that boss, and once you've got all the bosses you get the achievement. They'd killed yogg / vejax in previous weeks with no deaths, but had always had deaths on freya kills in the past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Look, we get that....<br />
1) Stacking mostly Int isn't fun.<br />
2) Having 70%+ overheal isn't fun.<br />
3) Focusing so much on the main tank in a raid isn't fun.<br />
4) Casting nothing but Holy Light isn't fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Why wouldn't it be? Why should I care what I need to stack? If intellect is good stat now, I will stack it. If mp5 was a FOTM stat, I would stack it, and some people would QQ about it beeing too good stat.<br />
2) Who cares? For this day, Blizzard has been keeping four healing classes different, someone uses direct heals, someone uses hots. If someone has made holy paladin, he/she has probably made it for reason, to be a healer using direct heals.<br />
3) IMO it is fun. And it is paladin's job. Why create a paladin if you don't want to singletarget heal? And also, in raid you can keep Beacon on your primary healing target and then spotheal randoms <br />
4) Cast FoL then? I keep casting them both in a single fight combined with Holy Shock and not getting bored.<br />
<br />
Paladin, a class hard to get inside, but once getting used with, the best and the most interesting healing class in whole game. Leave us alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
World first kills in video games = serious business?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Way hard. All it takes is a no lifer, with a massive amount of time on his hands and who can get out of the red shit on the ground to do PVE content.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All you have to do to clear PvE content is find 24 other no life, worthless to society virgins who aren't complete retards to raid with you. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Who gives a shit? More losers thinking they're succeeding in life by killing a boss in a game. Grats?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If only you knew how badly it tears me up inside that I can't go bragging around to my friends that I killed Algalon and Yogg Saron in the GAME World of Warcraft. I think life is over for me. <br />

I don't actually think that, but I was just repeating what he said.<br />
PvP isn't hard. At all.<br />
I think the people commenting on how gamers are virgins are stereotyping massively, because obviously they play WoW too if they're on this site, so they're calling themselves virgins. Are you less of a virgin if you play WoW just to PvP? I don't think so. There's millions of people on WoW, and with that it brings millions of different lifestyles, so we should drop that geek stereotype! If they don't play WoW but are on this site, then they're trolls and not doing anything productive with their time. I play WoW, I enjoy WoW, and I don't see how that makes me useless to society. I work and come home and play WoW with the rest of my time. How is working, and, say, coming home and watching TV or going to a bar with a friend more productive? What would one consider having a &quot;life&quot;? If you ask 100 people, everyone will give a different answer.<br />
I'm going to do what I like to do because it's my own time, and kudos to them for getting that title. There's alot of bitter trolls on today.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Can't we all just get along?</div></div><hr />

<br />
the reason we got conqueror on freya, is because we'd been doing knockx3 the past couple of weeks, and still had mimiron immortal left to do. after a 1% failure to mines last week, we got mimiron this week, and then went to freya. :-p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
To be honest, it's not such a big accomplishment either. It's pretty easy, the only reason some guild got it only now is because all the serious raidgroups have been practicing hardmodes.<br />
<br />
Gz anyway.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lazi</div><div class="date">2009-06-04, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not in Vicarious, but I feel like posts like yours have to be responded to. Firstly, Vicarious are ranked World #31 on Guildox, that's hardly &quot;some guild&quot; like they're sitting somewhere near the bottom of the rankings (like my own).<br />
<br />
Secondly, they've done every 'progress' achievement (going by GuildOx) except One Light in the Darkness (they've done 3), Mimiron Hard Mode &amp; Algalon. Plus they've done a lot of the 'extra' achievements. If you don't think they're &quot;worthwhile&quot;, that's your prerogative; but clearly Blizzard thinks they are or they'd never have added them in. <br />
<br />
So to say they haven't been working on hard modes, seems a little silly. If you really don't think it's a big deal, then there's no need to respond.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly what i thought -.- u need to have killed all keepers for the way to vezax and yogg to open... otherwise thers a massive wall blocking you... so this is probably a fake ...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocd9628b4295</div><div class="date">2009-06-05, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The achievement is done per boss, and doesn't reset. So each week you have one chance per boss to get the credit for that boss, and once you've got all the bosses you get the achievement. They'd killed yogg / vejax in previous weeks with no deaths, but had always had deaths on freya kills in the past.<br />
<br />

epic fail on blizz's part any1 agree?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm sure all of the people that continually failed at the old version of Immortal due to the fault of 1 or 2 people would disagree with you.<br />
<br />
While the old version was not necessarily inherently flawed, this version is less drastic. It was not Blizzard's goal to have individuals chastised or cast out, in extreme situations, because they caused the entire guild to fail on an achievement they had been working towards for the past 2-3 hours, so they changed it. Call it fail if you will, but after numerous failed attempts and the tension/drama that had caused, I for one am happy with the change.</div></div><hr />
