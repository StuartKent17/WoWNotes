Arena and Rated Battleground Season 9 is scheduled to end as early as June 21. At that point we will determine who is eligible for the end-of-season rewards, a process that should take approximately one week. It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for Arena titles and/or the Vicious Gladiator’s Twilight Drake to refrain from transferring their characters to another realm or faction until after Season 9 ends. During the break between seasons, all Rated Battleground and Arena matches will be unavailable.<br />
<br />
At the end of the season, Conquest Points will be converted to Honor Points, possibly exceeding the 4,000 point Honor cap. All Season 9 items will cost Honor Points (equivalent to their previous Conquest Point cost) when the season ends, with the exception of any items with rating requirements attached. These items will no longer be available for purchase.<br />
<br />
The next Arena and Rated Battleground season will begin for level-85 players approximately one week after the end of Season 9 and will coincide with the awarding of Season 9 titles and mounts. At that time, any Honor accrued above the 4,000-point cap will be converted into gold at a rate of 35 silver per point. In addition, Season 10 rewards will be made available for purchase with Conquest Points awarded during the new season. All Team and Personal Ratings will be wiped when Season 10 begins. Matchmaking Ratings, however, will carry over into Season 10.</div></div><hr />

yea this is true, cant possibly have a ilvl378 pvp gear out and firelands still not out, that would be weird for people would rather go in BWD HC with pvp gear since better stats by heaps lol<br />

so probably 22th or 28th june or 1st week of july</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure it's safe to assume anything going by Blizzard's patch track record. Also note that they said &quot;scheduled to end as early as June 21&quot; which really makes it sound like they're prepared for the possibility of it ending later than that.</div></div><hr />

if you copy a char to the ptr you end up with over 4000 Honour now (if you have more than 4000 from Honour and Conquest) I guess its them trying to make it easier for people to be geared given gear matters abit more than it does in pve (where been a week or two behind won't make it hell for you)</div></div><hr />

Actually if you read the blue post links, the devs already said that he 4000jp cap would remain. But besides your disappointment.. I have to ask why you are excited about those 4000VP turning into JP. There is nothing new you can buy with them, there is NO reason to save them. In fact, it is stupid to save them, the best thing you can do is buy the VP boots ASAP and sell them now before the bottom drops out of them. you really excited about spending 4000VP on one Maelstrom crystal?</div></div><hr />
