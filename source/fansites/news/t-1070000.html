I just received an update on the Patch 4.3.2, it seems that the update was postponed because of a very bad bug. As far as I know it means the patch won't happen tomorrow, however it might happen on wednesday in the US and thursday in Europe. If it's not the case it will be postponed to next week. <br />
<br />
The info was solid and was backed up by a few other things (announcement of PTRs going down, etc) but those last minute changes happen, and there's nothing I can do against them. This is also the reason why Blizzard doesn't announce patches early. <br />
<br />
Even if I always warn that things might be postponed, it still sucks when it does happen, and this is pretty much how comfortable I feel when I have to announce it (http://i.imgur.com/WEKwE.gif). Feel free to yell at me and make me sad. I'll be in my corner trying to hide in my happy place (http://i.imgur.com/zjL8T.gif).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think the 64 bit client is going live, it's probably a MoP feature. The testing on PTRs was extremely limited and restricted to people who actually took the time to download the .exe in a separate thread, etc ... Really, I doubt more than 100 people tested the latest build with a x64 client and that's not enough to go live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aaaaand that's why I prefer Blizzard over a horsewhipped-by-EA Bioware. Blizzard's more concerned than making sure that their patches actually WORK vs. releasing on a deadline whether or not they push something out that makes the game unplayable until they figure out how to fix it again. <br />
<br />
...Well, that and http://kotaku.com/5878669/<br />
<br />
Blizzard's Forums moderators are actually human beings that can at least differentiate between a web meme and an actual underage poster.<br />
<br />
Of course I do acknowledge the fact that the relationship dynamic of Blizzard/Activision and Bioware/EA is different. Blizzard gets a lot of leeway in regards to actually appeasing their customers because Blizzard is literally keeping Activision afloat, whereas EA would probably gut out Bioware and sell off the pieces if they even get the idea in their heads that they wouldn't obey Corporate's highly anal-retentive &quot;keep it T-rated always forever no matter what or where&quot; mantra towards policing their players.</div></div><hr />

How can you not release something on time when you dont even say when you release it? Just wondering...</div></div><hr />

The testing on PTRs was extremely limited and restricted to people who actually took the time to download the .exe in a separate thread, etc ... Really, I doubt more than 100 people tested the latest build with a x64 client and that's not enough to go live.<br />
<br />
We'll be disabling the PTR forums shortly. Going forward you will be able to find the latest 64-bit client on the Tech Support forums.<br />
<br />
Uhm..i think it will go live seeing that comment but not sure. Could be mistaken, but as i read it i can only think they are going to release it for everybody. <br />

How is that a surprise for you? It's easy to figure it out. <br />
<br />
All who are happy that it isn't going live are mages, rest are hunters.<br />
<br />
Hence mages gets a nerf and hunters get a buff.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard's more concerned than making sure that their patches actually WORK vs. releasing on a deadline whether or not they push something out that makes the game unplayable until they figure out how to fix it again.<br />
<br />
<br />
So the game was unplayable after a patch? You know, that's really strange because I could play every day since release. Must be a parallel universe you're living in.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. CAN is the operative term. It's all about luck. I'm all for nerfing the HIGH end but NOT at the expense of also nerfing our low end, which is like...sub-frost bad. You shrink the delta not the base.</div></div><hr />

He said it was coming, something changed and then he updated his news before anything relevant did or didn't happen. It's as reliable as ever, wtf are you talking about?<br />
<br />
also, the gif with the dog and the cupcake was hilarious.</div></div><hr />

It's not just a big fix patch, even though blizzard labels it as that.<br />
<br />
I'm sure a lot of us are hoping for the 64 bit client to be released with this patch too.</div></div><hr />

True.. Its only &quot;offline from 3:00-11:00&quot;, so as always (im guessing) we get it one day after US.<br />
Altho servers offline 2 days in a row meeeh..</div></div><hr />

Neither does the news for downtime on US servers.<br />
The screenshot above was photoshopped if you didn't figure that out.<br />
<br />
Blizzard almost never show that it's to apply a patch.</div></div><hr />

That's funny, because I just completely reloaded my WoW client to look (I'm a US player too). There is no mention of 4.3.2 in the breaking news.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, proof here: http://launcher.worldofwarcraft.com/alert -- that is the url for the message posted in breaking news section of the client. (The link is for US)</div></div><hr />

&quot;We will be performing scheduled maintenance on Wednesday, January 25th. Maintenance will begin at 3:00 AM PST and conclude at approximately 11:00 AM PST. During this time, all realms and many web services will be unavailable. Thank you for your patience. &quot;</div></div><hr />

Postponing a patch to fix bugs is way better than releasing it and then have your players to tell you what went wrong, this should always be the case, it's fundamental stuff to keep your subscribers happy. Nobody likes rushed work full of bugs that will only be annoying to everyone.</div></div><hr />
