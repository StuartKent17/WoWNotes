<br />
Calling all heroes: It’s time to draft your BlizzCon battle plan—the BlizzCon 2018 schedule (http://www.blizzcon.com/schedule) is here! Check out all the exciting developer panels, esports matches, and other events taking place during BlizzCon Opening Week from October 25–29 and at the main event on Friday, November 2 and Saturday, November 3 (note that times in the schedule are displayed in local time).<br />
<br />
When you purchase a BlizzCon 2018 Virtual Ticket, you’ll unlock access to live coverage of developer events and community content taking place on the Legendary, Mythic, and Epic stages. With this year’s BlizzCon All-Access Channel, you’ll also be able to keep up with all the big moments that take place during the show—and participate with live Q&amp;A polls and voting for the Virtual Ticket cosplay award!<br />
<br />
As always, you can catch Friday’s opening ceremony and all the tournament action on this year’s esports stages FREE here at BlizzCon.com.<br />
<br />
Attention Attendees!<br />
<br />
If you’re joining us in person in Anaheim, this year’s opening ceremony will be spread across more than one stage throughout the show. The live presentation will be jumping between stages as our developers show you what we’ve been working—stay tuned for more information on where you’ll want to seek out a seat. And of course, everything will be broadcast on screens and stages throughout the convention halls.<br />
<br />
There’s also still a chance to get tickets to attend the esports competitions of BlizzCon Opening Week in person at the Blizzard Arena—check out the announcement (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/news/21757770/attend-blizzcon-opening-week-in-person-tickets-on-sale-may-17) for all the details, and head to the Blizzard Arena Los Angeles ticketing site (http://www.axs.com/openingweek) to pick up tickets.<br />

One interpretation of this is that they have left room on the schedule for one extra panel on the Mythic and Epic stages by cutting each to 45 minutes and spacing them out. Possibly to add a last minute diablo panel in?</div></div><hr />

Well if they didn't convince me before to not give them the 50$ for virtual ticket I'm defo convinced now. 45 min of &quot;what's next&quot; in each game and very skimpy amount of panels.</div></div><hr />

wow-wide theres not alot they can really talk about though. We know the main stuff in 8.1 and by November it'll be way to early to talk about 8.2 in solid terms. So it will be 8.1 in detail and maybe like hints towards 8.2.</div></div><hr />

or a HD remake. I'd play the shit out of a D1 or D2 remake.<br />

That's exactly what I think. and people will be more excited for the remaster than &quot;what's next&quot; :D</div></div><hr />

That is my thought too. D3 is such a train wreck. I think Activision should avoid games that start with D and doing any more releases. See Destiny 2.</div></div><hr />

Hoping for this. News of a new Diablo, and then a Diablo 2 (or Diablo 1) remaster, and I will be extremely happy. This schedule definitely confirms we are getting something though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
8.1 will be almost out by then. And for Legions first Blizzcon they told us about every patch. up to 8.2 in detail. We will for sure get details on 8.1.5 and 8.2. Unless they are extremely behind with the expansion.</div></div><hr />

They just listed it that way so they don't give away the new Diablo. If you follow their format in previous years, it's pretty much telling you there is a major Diablo announcement being made.</div></div><hr />

Yes it does? You think they're gonna put Diablo 2 remastered right after the opening ceremony for 45 minutes? Please.<br />
<br />
The main juggernaut Blizzard has for profit is Overwatch and even that is afterwards, which means Diablo is getting higher priority</div></div><hr />

WoW will get some 8.1 info maybe, 8.2 reveals for certain, maybe 8.3 tease.<br />

Overwatch, the usual new hero + map + video I assume.<br />

Hearthstone new expansion obviously. <br />

or a HD remake. I'd play the shit out of a D1 or D2 remake.<br />
They did it with starcraft, this is a good possibility and one I welcome<br />
<br />
They wouldn't commit this much time to remakes. That they have a block right after the opening ceremony, and a Q&amp;A later for &quot;World&quot; means there's new content coming. D4? Maybe. <br />
<br />
I suspect it's a Witcher 3 type game. It's the perfect genre for their world builders and artists, and it's a tried and true genre now, that they don't have any games in. I kind of doubt they have a new MMO coming, but I'm not gonna rule it out, either, I'm just leaning towards a first person game, because the job listings over the last year or so mentioned first person. That, or D4. They wouldn't have any reason to do a Q&amp;A about the Diablo world for HD remakes.<br />
<br />
I think they're working on something else, that won't be announced this Blizzcon, and that could very well be a new MMO. I kind of doubt Holinka went to anything Diablo related.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
That is my thought too. D3 is such a train wreck. I think Activision should avoid games that start with D and doing any more releases. See Destiny 2.<br />
<br />
I always laugh at the D3 criticisms. The game is 6 years old now, the expansion 4, and it's one of the best selling games of all time. Yes, that's a total trainwreck.</div></div><hr />

I wish that the D game, and they could make a W game, in them style of a single RPG (dark souls, witcher, etc ) with optional multiplayer. That would be Sick as F, god that would be so good. And re reales d1-2 w 1,2,3 remasterd.<br />

I don't expect the next game soon either with only 45minutes of publicity over all of blizzcon.<br />

And the gearing is fantastic. Everything you pick up has value, thanks to Kanais cube. <br />

If they make ANY gameplay changes from vanilla, there will be a minor shitstorm. People who want classic overwhelmingly want the real deal.<br />

<br />
Taking the fact that there was also no WoW Vanilla announcement yet back at that time, I guess we won't hear anything else this year except for a status update on WoW Vanilla and possibly patch 8.2.

Just accept that Classic isn't ready for a Blizzcon segment yet. If there's anything to announce, like a beta or release date, the opening ceremony is the place to do it.<br />

There's a whole panel dedicated to classic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taking the fact that there was also no WoW Vanilla announcement yet back at that time, I guess we won't hear anything else this year except for a status update on WoW Vanilla and possibly patch 8.2. I'd be surprised even if they'd mention anything about the final patch this year as they did with Legion in 2016.<br />

<br />
They could do it if they make Diablo 4 more like Marvel Heroes was..Dungeons were party/self only but main areas outside of that is mmo-esque.</div></div><hr />

Yup. When i'm looking at that planning, EVERYTHING feels way shorted and the overall thing just feels empty.</div></div><hr />

Most the panels are. God forbid there would be any time to have a short QA!<br />
<br />
Also &quot;This year there is one less stage stream than last year.&quot;...<br />
Yeah, that +25% on the ticket price seems totally worth it!</div></div><hr />

I really hope all stuff related to Classic will be told on opening ceremony. Because what is more to say that it will come (I guess) fall 2019 and demo is released (BUY VIRTUAL TICKET WE HAVE DEMO BUYBUYBUY)? Rest are just boring technical details.<br />
<br />
And for Diablo, it must be IV or new big project (and no, mobile Diablo or II remastered are not &quot;big projects&quot;). Anything else would be disapointment.</div></div><hr />

Well, if they would buff one or two things, I wouldn't even be mad. Like the pala buffs that lasted only 5 min. Give them a raid wide buff option. Wouldn't hurt the game or play style, but greatly improve quality of life :3<br />
Or remove the decurse limit on bosses (40 max), warlocks will love you.<br />
<br />
Dunno - classic had so much shit in it that was just bad design... and many seem to have forgotten.</div></div><hr />

I know that's what occurred during the closing ceremony, but I think that doesn't necessarily mean there will be a major act closing the ceremony. It seems like whoever was closing the ceremony was announced much sooner than the month or so we have to go to the con. Just wondering. Maybe it has been announced and I just didn't see it.</div></div><hr />

Diablo is THE big annoucement of blizzcon just by being right after the opening ceremony, deal with it. It certainly wont be a near finished game releasing closely. But there will be a new diablo annoucement.<br />
<br />
Not sure what you're aiming for with the &quot;deal with it&quot; statement. I enjoy Diablo, I would very much like another game as well. But people have been screaming for D4 the past few yeas, every Blizzcon is the same. For all we know, this could be about the Nintendo Switch release or a mobile game.<br />
I honestly just don't want to get my hopes up again, but perhaps people will be right this year. Who knows.</div></div><hr />
