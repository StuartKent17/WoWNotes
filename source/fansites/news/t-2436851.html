If two people in a party, one with war mode enabled and one with war mode disabled are at a summoning stone then they can't use it because the game puts them in two separate phases which is annoying to say the least.</div></div><hr />

For real. What is this?</div></div><hr />

From my perspective, she is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She is alliance, war mode should be off. Horde overpopulate war mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on faction if she is alliance she would be correct to have it turned OFF. If she was horde she would be correct to have it turned ON. This is due to there be so many more horde than alliance its really noticeable playing both factions. My alliance toon cant run around for more than 5mins without bumping into loads of horde. My Horde toon can run around for like half the day and not see a single alliance.<br />
<br />
So as alliance its not worth having it on, you will get ganked over and over. As horde you may as well keep it on as no loss only gain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But if this is about phases, summoning, and warmode on/off. Maybe everyone has to turn &quot;on warmode&quot; because of that &quot;one guy&quot; because it takes 5 minutes to turn a pvp flag off? So faster for everyone to turn on?<br />
<br />
So yea still a bit slow on it for me this AM lol.</div></div><hr />
