PTR Development Notes - Build 25807<br />
Hi all!<br />
<br />
Today's PTR update includes a new method for acquiring Legendary items: the Purified Titan Essence. This item can be purchased from Arcanomancer Vridiel in Dalaran in exchange for 175 Wakening Essences.<br />
<br />
When used, the Purified Titan Essence will immediately grant a Legion Legendary item appropriate for your specialization. Note that this item is bind on pickup, and that the Legendary item granted by the Purified Titan Essence does not affect your chance to earn a Legendary through other methods.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the Awoken Titan Essence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/154879-awoken-titan-essence) used to upgrade Legendary items to item level 1000 is now sold by Arcanomancer Vridiel as a vendor item, rather than as a quest reward, for the same total cost (50 Wakening Essence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1533-wakening-essence)). The quest will no longer be offered, but can be turned in if your character already has it active.<br />
<br />

Balance Druid and Assassination Rogue January 9th ChangesAssassination and Balance Rotation Adjustments on Tuesday<br />
In recent weeks, we’ve seen the rise of a pair of unusual builds for Assassination Rogues and Balance Druids, both of which end up abandoning core abilities like Solar Wrath, Lunar Strike, and Mutilate in favor of Moonfire and Fan of Knives spam. While player ingenuity often devises interesting and unexpected ways of optimizing performance, in this case the resulting gameplay became one-dimensional, and we’ve heard feedback to that effect.<br />
<br />
As a result, with the upcoming weekly resets in each region, starting on Tuesday, January 9, we’ll be making some targeted changes to reinforce the core rotational abilities of these two specializations, with only a minimal effect on overall balance:<br />

Balance<br />
Wax and Wane (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/238083-wax-and-wane) (Artifact trait) damage bonus per stack reduced to 6% (was 25%).<br />
Lunar Strike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/194153-lunar-strike) damage increased by 8%.<br />
Solar Wrath (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/190984-solar-wrath) damage increased by 8%.<br />

Assassination<br />
Mutilate (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/1329-mutilate) damage increased by 20%.<br />
Balanced Blades (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/192326-balanced-blades) (Artifact trait) bonus increased to 4% per point (was 2% per point). Poison Knives (Artifact trait) reduced to 3% per point (was 4% per point).<br />
Deadly Poison (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/2823-deadly-poison) triggered instant damage increased by 15%.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for all of your feedback. I can't overstate how much we appreciate the valuable class discussion taking place here and elsewhere<br />

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3.2<br />
The test realms saw this patch pop up in 2012, and a few interesting additions were found. The popular 64 Bit Game Client was added in a build called “test x86”, and while this patch was only supposed to bring small bug fixes, it was also found that three new items made it into the game. The Feldrake, Eye of the Legion, and Demon Hunter’s Aspect were all found and speculated to become TCG items. <br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/january/thumb/feldrake.jpg (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2609-Patch-4-3-2-Items-Blue-Posts-Diablo-Anniversary-Page) <br />
<br />
Patch 5.2 The Thunder King<br />
This content Patch brought a few additions to the game. A small update to the Transmog system allowed players to transmog similar weapon styles, such as Swords into Daggers. Warlock Island was also found, and speculated that it would be used during the Green Fire Warlock specific questline. This patch also added new Heirloom items which scaled to level 85, along with a new zone called Isle of Giants.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Time for an Item Level Squish<br />
The Warlords of Draenor Item Level Squish was intended to bring the numbers of players health, damage, but especially that of bosses to a lower number. The last boss of Siege of Orgrimmar Mythic, was designed to heal to full health several times, because the game engine could not handle a number large enough to have his health progress as a regular boss would. It was also made very clear that this item level squish would not affect players clearing older content, such as raids for transmog, because everything will be scaled accordingly.<br />
<br />

<br />
Warlords of Draenor Cinematic<br />
A special event was held to reveal the cinematic trailer to the newest WoW expansion. Streamers, YouTubers, and Blizzard employees were all at this event, revealing the introduction cinematic, which gave us some insight into the Horde on the world of Draenor. This expansion would take place years in the past, when Gul’dan tried to corrupt the Orcs of Draenor with fel, however many resisted to preserve their freedom.<br />

<br />
Warcraft in China<br />
The Warcraft movie mall tour in China was the largest exhibition mounted for this new film. With over 150 props from the movie, visitors had the opportunity to see statues, Orc huts, and many more items during the tour. This was in an attempt to appeal to the Chinese audience, who ended up making up half of the gross total ($220.8 million) after the release.<br />

<br />
Activision Blizzard Acquires MLG Assets<br />
Major League Gaming was once the largest esports organizers in North America. After years of innovating the esports scene, the emergence of other organizers such as ESL put MLG in a tough spot with multiple competitors. This caused some financial struggles causing them to sell all assets to Activision Blizzard for $46 million. The platform was, and is still used to host WoW tournaments, and the newly formed Overwatch League, among others.<br />

<br />
Diablo 20th Anniversary<br />
The Diablo franchise celebrated its 20th Anniversary early 2017. To celebrate this event, a new dungeon was added to Diablo III. This new area was designed in the style of Diablo I, with graphics, movement, and sound being filtered to capture the feel of the game. This event was also celebrated in WoW, where killing a Treasure Goblin would allow players to reach The Secret Cow Level, and kill the Cow King for some Diablo referenced loot.<br />

And for those who rerolled and upgraded all of them already. And who haven't got BiS ones and most likely won't have BiS ones, they can suffer in silence again I guess ?<br />
<br />
This has to be an oversight, if anything, if they want to make it fair for everyone. Release a 2nd currency for it.</div></div><hr />

Whilst true, going into the patch being able to afford several tokens off the bat is huge compared to those of us who who'll only get the quest then</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean catchup mechanics like they did for the Ring in WoD?<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter much anyway since the system is going away in Battle for Azeroth and Antorus clears have already happened.<br />
<br />
Most people right now are either waiting for LFR to open to get their ring, done it on Normal/HC or are progressing Mythic.</div></div><hr />

I would imagine not, due to being able to get leggos for a random class or smth after you have gotten all your leggos, due to an update a long time ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't matter much anyway since the system is going away in Battle for Azeroth and Antorus clears have already happened.<br />
<br />
Most people right now are either waiting for LFR to open to get their ring, done it on Normal/HC or are progressing Mythic.<br />
<br />
It might not matter to you, but this is a great change for me. I got bis leggos on main, and 2 of my 3 regularly played alts. My final alt has KJ and cindaria, which suck, so I welcome this!</div></div><hr />

I didn't mean to me. I meant in general because the system is going away soon so now is the perfect time to offer one final catchup burst for it before it's gone. It doesn't have a huge effect in return because a lot of the raiding is done now anyway and the only people left to get the free 1000 ring will get it in a couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
Hell I welcome it too. Means I can actually be bothered to work on my 12 alts now. :)</div></div><hr />

Calm down there is no way that you will can save essence now and get an advantage over other players, wont make it live that way.<br />
They will implement that old essence are for upgrade only...</div></div><hr />

<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you upgraded all the legendaries you have you can't get the quest anymore.<br />
<br />
So you are incapable of reading?<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, the Awoken Titan Essence used to upgrade Legendary items to item level 1000 is now sold by Arcanomancer Vridiel as a vendor item, rather than as a quest reward, for the same total cost (50 Wakening Essence). The quest will no longer be offered, but can be turned in if your character already has it active.<br />
<br />
So the essence is no longer a quest objective-currency hybrid, but just a currency.</div></div><hr />

Can't hurt to anticipate on this actually not happening.<br />
<br />
I'm certain they won't wipe essences or introduce a new currency in the last months of the expansion when all tiers are cleared.</div></div><hr />

I think if Blizz does anything, they will put a cap on how many essences you can hold at once, and anything over the cap will be turned into gold. They've held a dim view on squirreling away currencies before, so it's not unreasonable to think this time will not be any different.</div></div><hr />

Blizz won't go live with the system as is - they'll wipe existing essences or something like that. Seriously, grow up and stop running around in a childish panic about something that is obviously still being worked on.</div></div><hr />

All legendaries crafted AFTER the Anthorus release are already iL 1000. So nope, your idea is not THAT simple at all. ;-) On my server there are no &lt;1000 iL legendaries left.</div></div><hr />

It is simple. But yeah, you need to buy those that are 970, most of them are bought up by gold makers (me included) by now, and relisted for 10x the price :)</div></div><hr />

Yes something like this will happen for sure - they won't let people who are lucky because they can still collect the essences to have a edge against people who can't collect them anymore. <br />
<br />
And when did blizzard allow such a thing like collecting things in advance to use them on patch day. They for sure will have a solution which sucks for everyone :)</div></div><hr />

It's not like anyone is getting a massive boost come BoA, since leggos will be gone. Just let people bank a few hundred essences to test out the leggos we missed and then be done with it. FWIW, I have not hoarded them, but I do have some un-upgraded ones on alts, so I have a spattering of essences spread over multiple chars. I *might* consider farming 175 on maybe one or two classes which I played very little, to test them out, but since it takes quite a bit of time, I probably won't. And if they indeed wipe whatever little I have collected so far, I'll certainly not bother. Now... if they allowed you to use 50 essences to get a random one, THAT would be something to strive for.<br />
<br />
All in all, this would have been a great feature one or two patches ago. Since they decided to &quot;balance the raids&quot; around legendaries, it's kind of amusing that they still insisted them to be totally random, up until now.</div></div><hr />

I'm still a bit salty that DH cannot mog their warglaives into fist weapons. Some Vengeance DH weapons are held exactly like fists but no...<br />

Regarding this Titanic Essence nightmare, they should do one thing to solve all their problems. Wipe out all Essences of everyone, automatically upgrade ALL legendaries to 1000, then removing this thing from the game and simply add the &quot;random leg token&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It states to me people want an option to build up an alt quicker. With EVERYTHING being a grind, it would be nice to be able to funnel time on your main to your alt i.e. in the form of purchasable legendaries for your actual alt, not some random garbage loot box system. This has been the WORST expansion by LEAPS and BOUNDS for punishing people for having more than one character. Maybe making it slightly easier might have been a nice touch.</div></div><hr />

But bows and guns only have one animation<br />
The fist VS swors atacks are way too diferent. Yes, it would work out fine nonetheless, most vengeance dh glaives look like existing fist weapons from wod, tbc etc anyways...</div></div><hr />
