Also, a 355 Azerite Armor chest is the new conquest reward for this week for those who capped last week. If you did not cap last week then you can continue your progress for the weapon and start on the new reward right after.<br />

Call to Arms: Zuldazar<br />
This week's Call to Arms is Call to Arms: Zuldazar (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/52951-call-to-arms-zuldazar) or Call to Arms: Zuldazar (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/52952-call-to-arms-zuldazar). Head to Zuldazar with warmode enabled to kill 10 players of the opposing faction. You no longer have to loot an air supply! This will reward you with conquest and 75 reputation for either 7th Legion (https://www.wowdb.com/factions/2159-7th-legion) or The Honorbound (https://www.wowdb.com/factions/2157-the-honorbound).</div></div><hr />

Honestly. FF14 patch 4.4 is next week. Might just have a mini break from WoW again and play that.<br />
<br />
Because Blizzard are seriously starting to irritate me now. We just had imo a great expansion in Legion and the whole &quot;glamour&quot; of this one wore off fast if you catch my drift.<br />
<br />
If I enjoy FF14 I'll just play that until 8.3 or w/e when the catch up is in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where did I say that? Please don't put words in my mouth.<br />
<br />
I said they could have at least shown some full clarity on the matter. Rather than the obscurity as you yourself admitted to.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm irritated because this expansion for some (not all) features lacks clarity on their side. And when they finally do give some clarity it's very last minute.</div></div><hr />

It's longer than that. You have to take your cycle in to account as well. You do everything once when you are in control. Then you have to wait for your cycle to end, Horde cycle to begin and end, then get control back THEN you can do it. So more like a 3 week reset.</div></div><hr />

You don’t need further explanation. You nailed it with “beyond stupidity”. What you may be mistaking for confusion is disbelief that the system really is that bad.... but you understand it just fine.</div></div><hr />

That's kinda idiotic to advertise &quot;up to 3 items&quot; if the probability is 0.1%.<br />
That's the easiest way to piss off the population. Better to not say anything, and once someone loots 2 or 3 items, you draw the Tweet &quot;yes, that's a possibility :) Enjoy !&quot;, and you seem like the good guy.</div></div><hr />

But you can only do it once while you control it. So if you do it on Day 1, like many of us do, then you have to wait through your entire cycle and their entire cycle before you can do it again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, that's pretty much it. There are two states, Control and Assault, with the factions altering states about every two weeks. The Assault is broken into two parts, Gathering and Warfront scenario.<br />
<br />
When your faction is in Control (Alliance started in Control, lasts approximately two weeks) the controlling faction can do some quests (one for a 340+ item) and the world boss (once during the whole time, 370 loot chance + bonus roll).<br />
<br />
The Assaulting faction first spends five days collecting resources (it's not clear anyone actually has to contribute anything in order for it to complete, but the turn-ins reward a lot of Azerite Power and are worth doing I think) then at 100% it unlocks the PvE Warfront scenario and a one time guaranteed 370 drop quest for winning the scenario the first time plus one 340+ drop for EACH time you run the scenario (instant queuing, takes 20-30 minutes to complete normally).<br />
<br />
Once the 7 day Warfront scenario timer counts down to zero, presumably the Control changes hands, the new Assaulting faction will start contributing resources, the new Controlling faction will get the world boss and quests, and the new 120 Arathi Highlands rares will reset and offer BOTH factions loot/mount/pet drops again (to be determined if this is in fact the case, but they did not reset with maintenance today).<br />
<br />
So the whole cycle is about a month before you get back to where you started. In that month you'll get to kill all the rares in the Arathi zone twice for ~10% each chance of a drop (340+ or pet/mount), kill the world boss once, and have a week of running the Warfront scenario over and over for ridiculous amounts of 340+ gear with a high chance of Warforging+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly, in the future it will take longer than those 4 or 5 days to gather the resources. People wanted to try the new feature so they spend more time and money in collecting the resources than they will in the future. I'd be not surprised if it took the Alliance this week already longer, since the Alliance now knows how lacklustre the feature is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaxien</div><div class="date">2018-09-11, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that's pretty much it. There are two states, Control and Assault, with the factions altering states about every two weeks. The Assault is broken into two parts, Gathering and Warfront scenario.<br />
<br />
When your faction is in Control (Alliance started in Control, lasts approximately two weeks) the controlling faction can do some quests (one for a 340+ item) and the world boss (once during the whole time, 370 loot chance + bonus roll).<br />
<br />
The Assaulting faction first spends five days collecting resources (it's not clear anyone actually has to contribute anything in order for it to complete, but the turn-ins reward a lot of Azerite Power and are worth doing I think) then at 100% it unlocks the PvE Warfront scenario and a one time guaranteed 370 drop quest for winning the scenario the first time plus one 340+ drop for EACH time you run the scenario (instant queuing, takes 20-30 minutes to complete normally).<br />
<br />
Once the 7 day Warfront scenario timer counts down to zero, presumably the Control changes hands, the new Assaulting faction will start contributing resources, the new Controlling faction will get the world boss and quests, and the new 120 Arathi Highlands rares will reset and offer BOTH factions loot/mount/pet drops again (to be determined if this is in fact the case, but they did not reset with maintenance today).<br />
<br />
So the whole cycle is about a month before you get back to where you started. In that month you'll get to kill all the rares in the Arathi zone twice for ~10% each chance of a drop (340+ or pet/mount), kill the world boss once, and have a week of running the Warfront scenario over and over for ridiculous amounts of 340+ gear with a high chance of Warforging+.<br />
<br />
I think a little clarification is in order. I truly believe that it is intended to be a 2 week cycle. LET ME EXPLAIN. Keeping in mind this is based on the first week(last week). There are quests(That show up as blue exclamation points, giving you the sense that they are repeatable, when in fact, they are NOT. I suppose they have to be flagged that way because they will be available again on the next cycle of gathering. Being early on in the expansion, I can tell you that the resource gathering was effing OUTRAGEOUS. Nobody in their right mind was going to spend the gold they would have needed to last week to buy the materials to make the quest items or the actual quest items themselves. I have no data to back this up, but I truly believe that the gathering phase is designed to last 1 week, and would slowly creep up to 100% if NOBODY contributed to it. This would ensure that no matter what, the cycle would continue instead of one side just sitting on it forever, which would eventually happen, because we, as a human race, have a tendency to be assholes when we have nothing better to do. <br />
<br />
Contributing only speeds up the process. Therefore, it stands to reason that as we get more people hitting 120 on their mains and alts, and maxing out more professions, gathering more crafting materials, which will drive the price of said materials down, the gathering phase will become shorter and shorter every cycle. What took over 4 days last week will likely take less and less time as time goes by, to a point where it is no longer beneficial to even alts, at which point it will start to revert back, unless they continue to release more and more warfronts with better rewards. This almost HAS to be the case to ensure continued participation.<br />
<br />
All of that being said, even though I am on the Horde almost explicitly, I feel the way this all works is broken. If there were true PVP involved in this, I think the view on this would be much different. Unfortunately, there is literally NO PVP involved, not in the gathering phase, and not in the Warfront Phase. It is all AI. Because of this, What is the point in making the opposite faction wait for so long? Why not just either:<br />
<br />
1. Have everyone on a simultaneous rotation. This would encourage racing to gather the resources and transition to the next phase to do the Warfronts. During this time, the world boss is up for your faction in Arathi so you still get the chance to do them. How quickly your faction completes the resource gathering determines how soon your next cycle will start.<br />
<br />
2. Do away with the resource gathering completely and make it so you control for 1 week, when you have access to the world bosses, and then attack for 1 week where you can do Warfronts. This would eliminate the gold dump that Blizzard is trying to encourage by having us &quot;gather resources&quot; in order to activate the warfront. If we all boycotted this and just let the timer go for a week, we are really only hurting ourselves by delaying the cycle by a couple more days.(and punishing the opposite faction while we are at it, by causing them to have to wait that extra 3 days to have access).<br />
<br />
I dunno, I agree with a lot of people that their intentions might be good, but I don't think the idea was thought through very well.</div></div><hr />

By your own explanation, wouldn't that make it a 4 week cycle / monthly warfront?<br />
<br />
Week 1 - alliance controls Arathi, horde contributes resource<br />
Week 2 - alliance controls Arathi, horde queues for scenario<br />
Week 3 - alliance contributes resource, horde controls Arathi<br />
Week 4 - alliance queues for scenario, horde controls Arathi<br />
<br />
As for the repeatable quests, I can't remember now which color the Darkmoon Faire quests have, but they're also &quot;monthly repeatable&quot;. Maybe they should find a different color for the &quot;more than daily reset repeatable quests&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Warfront is an event based on the system used by the Broken Shore buildings from Legion, and they in turn were not affected/determined by the weekly reset.<br />

<br />
Except that the Mage Tower/Broken Shore buildings were a cycling turn-in event similar to this and were affected by the weekly reset. If the WB bulding went up on a Monday and it reset on Tuesday, you could rekill the boss on Tuesday for a second shot at loot for that cycle. So it would have made sense that in this case, it too would have that situation, especially given how long each side of the cycle is. By making a cycle of nearly 2 weeks per side, you effectively make that content virtually a non-part of the game since it happens so infrequently. It is like using a holiday or the DMF as a tent-pole for propping up your expansion. While it is a featured event, it is so rare that it seems silly to use as some huge selling point given how rarely you get to actually do it. Currently, with the estimates of 11-12 days per cycle, there will be about 2.5 Warfront Scenarios per month. So effectively, Warfronts are as common to play through as the Darkmoon Fair with the rares being about the same. Yay?</div></div><hr />

Effectivelly it's a once per month activity (each part in the cycle), with each of the 4 phases lasting about a week. This whole &quot;once per month&quot; is arguable, indeed. It is now clear why they're giving a guaranteed high ilvl epic and why they wouldn't have been able to do it if it was a weekly event (if it was weekly, you'd also just get a loot every 4 weeks/kills). So yes, while this is a design decission, what's bad is that all this cycle is not easily explained anywhere ingame for the normal player to understand - only a fraction of the player base knows how the thing works and as we can see, not even these few that post on mmo-c know it very well, because it's all confusing.</div></div><hr />

I guess, personally, I would rather they had set it up where the contributions effected, say, the quality of the mobs you start with, but that it was a timing issue for the scenario. Reset on Tuesday, contribute until Friday morning, scenario opens and your troops are of a quality depending on your contribution level, and you have until reset. Then you control for a week while the other faction does the same. Adjust the drop rate of the 370 gear (and higher ilvl later on) to account for this. I say this as someone playing the game and wanting to actually have shit in game to do. Getting all your shit done while &quot;controlling&quot; on the first day and having nothing to do for nearly 2 weeks is boring and ridiculous, from a design standpoint. You effectively make your content pointless and hardly worthwhile. Literally the only redeeming quality is that you can likely level a 110-&gt;120 inside the same reset to get a chance at the WB or Warfront. That's it.</div></div><hr />

It is exactly this. Every two weeks ownership of Arathi changes to the opposite faction. This means every two weeks you can do something there (which takes about an hour in total between rares, quests, and world boss/scenario depending on which side you’re on).<br />

Your math is a bit off. It’s 14 days per cycle. It doesn’t matter how fast a faction gathers in regards to speeding up the process. If next week the alliance manage to gather everything 10 minutes after the servers reset, they still have 14 days to kill rares and do the scenario.</div></div><hr />

I said they could have at least shown some full clarity on the matter. Rather than the obscurity as you yourself admitted to.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm irritated because this expansion for some (not all) features lacks clarity on their side. And when they finally do give some clarity it's very last minute.<br />
<br />
I agree with you. Blizzard introduces this new features in BFA, but there is no in game explanation or guide for anything.<br />
<br />
Nobody knows how anything works anymore. <br />
<br />
And I don't think they even give clarity at very last minute. It is because US server has already done maintenance and players find out by themselves.</div></div><hr />

Comments like yours are so stupid as people like you fundamentally don't understand how RNG works. Yes, you can get unlucky. I got boots in my first 5 WEEKS of M+ in Legion.

It doesn’t matter how fast a faction gathers in regards to speeding up the process. If next week the alliance manage to gather everything 10 minutes after the servers reset, they still have 14 days to kill rares and do the scenario.<br />
<br />
Has this actually been confirmed or is this speculation? Because the only thing I have seen is that, once the scenario opens, the faction (Horde, this time) will have 7 days to mess with the scenario before the the opposing faction can contribute. That tells me that the faster you contribute, the faster that 7 day clock starts, so if, as in your example, the Alliance turns in 100% contributions in 10 minutes right after reset, they would only get that week to complete. So if it was confirmed at a 14 day cycle, then I must have missed where that was clearly stated. Can you provide a link? Just curious about what the Blues said with regards to it all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Week 1 - alliance controls Arathi, horde contributes resource<br />
Week 2 - alliance controls Arathi, horde queues for scenario<br />
Week 3 - alliance contributes resource, horde controls Arathi<br />
Week 4 - alliance queues for scenario, horde controls Arathi<br />
<br />
As for the repeatable quests, I can't remember now which color the Darkmoon Faire quests have, but they're also &quot;monthly repeatable&quot;. Maybe they should find a different color for the &quot;more than daily reset repeatable quests&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mia Culpa, I didn't clarify, I meant for each side. So yes, a full cycle would be a month.</div></div><hr />

This week's Call to Arms is Call to Arms: Zuldazar or Call to Arms: Zuldazar. Head to Zuldazar with warmode enabled to kill 10 players of the opposing faction. You no longer have to loot an air supply! This will reward you with conquest and 75 reputation for either 7th Legion or The Honorbound.<br />
<br />
Hey, is this repeatable? Just hit rev with 7th and that would be very much appreciated.</div></div><hr />
