FOTM reroller pissed they can't reroll again easily this expansion - nothing to see here.<br />
This patch is great with the rebalancing of a lot of specs - some need more love still, however. Even though I will have 5 of the classes @ AK25 pre-patch and another @ 23 - bring on the AK catchup! Incoming rest of the classes without having to feel like gaining AP is useless!<br />

I've played the same character as a main for 10 years you twat. The patch is a disaster because they are massively overhauling some classes part way through an expack due to completely ignoring feedback given to them in beta.</div></div><hr />

Patch 7.1.5 Hype! What is everyone looking forward to the most? For me, Brawlers guild!<br />
<br />
As a member of progression guild and me trying to earn a slot in the mythic team. Im looking for to Nighthold. Im making a Aff Warlock for it. Currently lvl 70 and im also looking foward to a BiS on this aff and the NH tier set for it also :) <br />
<br />

You can purchase up to AK15 for 500 each AK. This means 12-15 costs 1500. For alts you can purchase 5/10/15/20 AK 1000 depending on AK on your main. So someone with AK10 on their main can purchase AK5 for alts, AK25 can purchase AK20. It's 1000 for all the levels if buying the BoA AK for alts. So AK20 costs 1000, not 20000.</div></div><hr />

That's just too funny. In the same sentence you are complaining because Blizzard ignore feedback and simultaneously complaining that they have responded to feedback. There's no pleasing some people.</div></div><hr />

Quite the truth. Still I kind of can't shake the feeling that it's just the same old only dressed up prettier. We will see in around a year's time how things settle down. Had fun until a week or two ago... barely logging nowadays.</div></div><hr />

I second this, I have a lot of alts that I want to get to 110 but I don't have the dedication to level AK on a bunch of alts. I have over 36k order resources on my main just to be on the safe side though and plenty of bloods just in case.</div></div><hr />

This means 12-15 costs 1500. For alts you can purchase 5/10/15/20 AK 1000 depending on AK on your main. So someone with AK10 on their main can purchase AK5 for alts, AK25 can purchase AK20. It's 1000 for all the levels if buying the BoA AK for alts. So AK20 costs 1000, not 20000.<br />
<br />
Are you sure about that? If this is the actual case, catching up on alts is nowhere near as painful as I thought it would be.</div></div><hr />

You can do it with rogue if you want ak20 on alts, or with DH if you want ak15 on alts. <br />
Or you can buy with DH til ak15, and add last 5 from rogue.</div></div><hr />

So .... what I gather from what you're saying is that the &quot;1-20 catch up&quot; is a BOA item which I could buy on my hunter (AK25) for 1K order hall resources and then mail to my 110 alts. Is that correct?</div></div><hr />

Shaping up to be a real solid disappointment. 7.2 better be dope.<br />
7.1.5 is just a &quot;micro-patch&quot; focused on &quot;evergreen content&quot; that is being release to coincide with the opening of the next raid tier.<br />
<br />
They already outlined what 7.2 would feature at Blizzcon: Broken Shore zone + campaign, flying + class mounts, Legion invasions, new dungeon and raid, PVP Brawl mode, etc. 7.2.5 will be another micro-patch and 7.3 is the journey to Argus.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the expansion's only been out for about four months, yet we've already gotten two content patches. Following the current release schedule, 7.2 will probably be out in early April (PTR within a couple weeks), with 7.2.5 in June and 7.3 in September.<br />
<br />
By then we'll have had Gamescom and we'll probably know what the next expansion will be and how they intend to bridge the content between 7.3 and 8.0. Then we'll see if they can truly keep their promise of keeping a steady stream of content for the entire lifecycle of the expansion. Assuming they don't instead announce a change to their overall business model or something.</div></div><hr />

lol so your saying this expansion is worse then wod?<br />
<br />
an expansion that allready has more content then wod did (counting when nighthold comes out) with 2 more guaranteed raids after, one allready being known to be massive<br />
<br />
also i dont think you know what SJW means... you just chose to use the word cause you get triggered easily and hate the word, so you chose to use it as a term that means nothing<br />

WotLK&gt;BC=MoP&gt;Legion&gt;&gt;Cata&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;WoD for me<br />

I'll go TBC=WOTLK&gt;Legion&gt;MOP&gt;Cata&gt;WOD. Legion has beem nice but also because it's not as bad as the three previous for me. If Blizzard could knock out a TBC/WOTLK level of epic expansionism they will be back at the top. Legion bit too small for me.

Nuance? What's that? You can still think the expansion is good while thinking there are issues and there most certainly is, class balance is horrid, quite possibly the worst its ever been outside of vanilla. But if you think the game is currently worse than WoD, you're full of it or never played it. Also if the game is so frikkin bad and &quot;dead&quot; why are you here? Stalking your first love or what? If you don't enjoy the game, leave. I don't understand why people who don't like the game hang around here. It's mental!

We're also getting Nighthold, which yes, it has been in the files, but so what? The raid team is already off working on 7.2 and unlike 6.1, we didn't have 2 massive raids in the months beforehand. Glad they wised up and didn't throw it all at us.</div></div><hr />

To expect even a little bit of content from (by previous expacks standards) not even a minor patch is ridiculous. Before, a X.Y.5 patch would bring us some bug fixes and a little bit of rebalancing. What we have is more than all the X.Y.5 's combined brought us. You want 'real' content? Wait for content patch, fool.<br />

As stated in Blizzcon, the patch delivery system was modified for Legion to allow for more streamlined content release rather than overwhelmingly large chunks. <br />
<br />
7.0, 7.2, 7.4 for example were always going to be big raid patches as they have been in the past.<br />
7.1, 7.3 7.6 are to be the smaller content patches with things like karazhan etc as we have seen much similar to MOP was with smaller story arcs<br />
<br />
7.1.5 style patches were not meant to be content heavy patches. They're essentially the hotfix/retuning patch and also a chance to implement content that wasn't quite ready in time. Which is why we get mini-holidays and timewalking for example. <br />
<br />
At Blizzcon Blizzard said they would rather release patches like this so that rather than hold an entire patch back for months and have a content drought, we have instead a steady stream of content available. So this isn't a content patch, 7.1.5 is meant to be the bigger tuning patch that requires a patch to implement changes. The fact we get time-walking and mini holidays is simply because they were not ready for implementation in time during 7.1. <br />
<br />
I hope now those whining feel a little bit more informed rather than crying. Not likely though.</div></div><hr />

Not looking forwards to destruction talent changes - but I'll live with them and enjoy being able to try out and have fun with a new spell or two even if it's forced onto me. More AoE viability is a bit fun, even if it's not efficient and it'll hurt my numbers, me and my guild will still kill all the bosses we need to. <br />
<br />
Brawler's guild looks great - it was a pretty interesting chain to climb before, though I never played it myself I was exposed to it a lot. I don't plan to play the brawler's guild at all but I can see it'll be a good bit of fun for some friends I know who enjoy different things and who would enjoy it. It's a nice addition to the game at max level. <br />
<br />
Mop Timewalking I can take or leave. More variety is always nice, and everyone likes it when timewalking week rolls around. Even if you don't plan to/ enjoy doing the MoP dungeons, a few new cool rewards to just pick up from the vendor for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then one week later, Nighthold's out. We're all looking forwards to that in my guild. We just got Ahead of the Curve Xavius heroic last week, and we're happy and proud with the progress we made together over the weeks since Legion launch, both in gear performance and organisation. We'll likely never touch mythic due to it's strict 20-man requirement but we're not bothered by it, we enjoy the content we have and it's lasted plenty long for us. <br />
<br />
<br />
But we're super psyched about taking all that teamwork and banter and fun into nighthold. It'll be plenty fun regardless of what talents I have to use or if destruction warlock is 2% lower than fire mage or some other silly thing so many people moan so much over, and shoot themselves in the foot, sabotaging their own hobby and falling into the negativity trap.</div></div><hr />

What about Heroic CoS/Kara etc? Or is that for 7.2? (Not sure why it would be, 7.1.5 seems like a good time to bring those in)<br />
<br />
They said at Blizzcon that 7.2 will have all that plus the queueable Mythics. This is a micro patch. Best I could compare it to is a .5 patch in FF14. Both are minor patches. Blizzards idea now after Karazhan is Major-Minor-Major. Which if they can get the pacing down I think is brilliant. Although I think they still intend to do medium sized patches like 7.1.<br />
<br />
Note I said &quot;IF&quot; though. Because well they have said they wanted to do quicker pacing for years and I'm not gonna suddenly say &quot;it's happening&quot; because of 1 medium and minor patch.</div></div><hr />

i think he's more referring to the fact that SEF had bug reports very early on in the legion beta and we're JUST NOW getting fixes for it. I main WW, and while i'm glad they finally fixed our signature 2 minute steroid cooldown, i'm not impressed that it took them THIS LONG to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that's the case why not just announce the actual date it's going to be available? and nice meme<br />
<br />
Edit: The in-game calendar goes through feb with the weekly events (not the annual ones) so I'm guessing march. Again, why even make it sound like it's going to be released on Jan 10th when in reality it won't be out for months?</div></div><hr />

<br />
WotLK&gt;BC=MoP&gt;Legion&gt;&gt;Cata&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;WoD for me<br />
<br />
i was hating on WoD when it was current but from the perspective of time... being able to only log on for raids and not do anything else in wow was pretty great, tbh legion is the expansion that made me stop playing</div></div><hr />

<br />
This will be a dumpsterfire of a patch once the majority of the playerbase learn of the damage Blizz has done to the game.</div></div><hr />

It's not really new content if you can't actually do it. Either cram it in (sorry World Quest Bonus week), add it as a special one-time thing (to later recur as normal) or wait until it's actually live.</div></div><hr />

It's fine though this is the only website where you still find whiteknights/SJW's everyone else in the community knows how garbage this game has become and this expansion being the worst to-date.<br />
<br />
Wow I thought your tears were delicious the first time, but this new round is like a delicacy. <br />
<br />
You might want to invest some time in some google searches to help you understand the concept of complexity, shades of gray, and what SJW means. Also, it's still hysterical that your dislike of the game equates in your mind to a dead game.</div></div><hr />

Also my class is also the worst.<br />
Any changes are always bad.<br />
There is always too much and too little to do.<br />

Patch 7.1.5 covers all the bases I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What a joke.<br />
<br />
There's kinda like this huge thing effecting your stats, spells and talents in this patch you might want to get a clue about since you'll probably have to relearn your rotation and reconsider your main spec. For most people, that's a pretty decent amount of work. Just a hint though. If you're doing something other than pet battling or collecting pretty outfits for your waifu Night Elf you'd be aware.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure why you think changing your rotation is content.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure why you don't. It's work, effort, research and satisfaction when you reach your goal. Maybe you should get a better understanding of what content means.</div></div><hr />

<br />
brawlers guild has new bosses ... not new content? ok then<br />
micro holidays like being a guard to defend stormwind, ride around on a boat or air balloon and do shit, also raise a hypogrph baby? all not content? ok then<br />
mop dungeons isnt really content, thats right but yeah<br />
<br />
also this is a fucking x.x.X patch.... this is not the biggest patch ever there has been no x.x.X patch that has unleashed new content<br />
<br />
X.x.x is the expansion number<br />
x.X.x is the CONTENT PATCH NUMBER like 7.1.0 had karazhan, trial of valor raid, and new world quests, falcosaur, etc<br />
x.x.X is a minor patch, like bugs, minor added content, or changes<br />
<br />
if your complaining that &quot;WTF 7.1.5 HAS NO RAID, DUNGEON, OR MASSIVE QUEST CHAINS WTF&quot; <br />
its allmost like its a minor patch used for bug fixing, balance changes, and minor additions...</div></div><hr />

<br />

in this patch.<br />
<br />
I think you need to understand that changing a rotation isn't content, Nor is it adding anything to the patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh there's a new patch out for XXXX! They're making me change my rotation, SUCH CONTENT! MANY COOL! MUCH AWESOME!<br />
<br />
Said no one ever.</div></div><hr />
