During the livestream, you’ll get a first look at some exciting changes we’re making to the Virtual Ticket this year—and as a bonus, we’ll be revealing the first of this year’s BlizzCon in-game goodies! We can’t wait for you to join us.</div></div><hr />

Probably just be business as usual.<br />

Pet for WoW. Murloc related obviously.<br />
Portraits for SC2.<br />

I know that, I'm curious as to what they're going to involve though.<br />

I don't expect to see a Murloc though if they're announcing the next expansion at BlizzCon, since the murloc is always related to upcoming content, at least usually is.</div></div><hr />

Really seems expensive in a twitch world, but they did at least try to add value with the additional ability to buy Blizzcon goodie bags. Back when it came out a long time ago at that price point, it was either buy that or the $75 DirecTv PPV (PPV got you the Blizzcon bear though). Won't be buying it this year</div></div><hr />

lol good catch! hard to know if it's void related or naga related...<br />

True, but they also don't have login screen music until much later in the Beta cycle usually.</div></div><hr />

Um no it's not. The bass is much lower than that video and there are different instruments and songs used in their rendition of Legends of Azeroth. I'm not spreading any lies nor am I spreading it as the blatant truth either so stop acting like it.<br />

That part is commonly used in the login screen music. It's present in BC, WOTLK, Cataclysm, and Legion. MoP and WoD had it nearly entirely redefined but still retained it's original theme.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not just the bass is lower but the music itself has a much stronger feeling and a different pace than the other themes. This is all speculation but Blizzard hyping up their product for hype [which sells] is not unusual since Blizzcon is less than 62 days away. They could reveal the login theme as a first time as well as when they revealed cinematic [as they did with Legion] before an actual release date was given.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not trying to point out the blatantly obvious here. but 7.3 has already been out for a while. we can assume (because of it's similar design to 5.4) that this is probably the last patch of this expansion. We haven't even heard of any new expansion yet, it's not even been rumoured. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard doesn't announce an expansion it would mean a minimum time of 8-16 months of 7.3 (or 7.4)<br />
<br />
Time gap between previous expansions (last patch - prepatch):<br />
<br />
MoP - WoD 2013-09-10 ---&gt; 2014-10-14 (11 months)<br />
<br />
WOD - Legion 2015-06-23 ---&gt; 2016-07-19 (13 months) <br />
<br />
I'd bet at least a 12 months. so the release of the next expansion would be around september-october 2018</div></div><hr />
