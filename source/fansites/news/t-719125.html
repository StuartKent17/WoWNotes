Cataclysm Screenshot of the Day<br />
A new screenshot has been added to the official Screenshot of the Day Gallery (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/ssotd/). Today is another look at Gilneas. <br />

Reminder - Ruby Sanctum PTR Testing Today<br />
Now that the 3.3.5 patch is available for PTR testing, we wanted to have a round of focus testing for Ruby Sanctum. Only normal mode will be available, with Heroic testing to occur at a later date.<br />
<br />
Everything related to this zone is implemented for this test, please note any issues with the trash creatures and sub-bosses, loot, achievements, and quests.<br />
<br />
US Testing Schedule:<br />
Date to be determined<br />
<br />
EU Testing Schedule:<br />
Tuesday, May 18 starting at 19:30 CEST.<br />
<br />
We plan to allow testing for an extended period. However since this is the Test Realm, unforeseen issues could delay or cancel testing at any time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Elitist Armory<br />
Today is a slow news day, so here’s a new armory website that popped up! It’s related to an addon I mentioned a few months ago, Elitist Group (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/elitist-group-blue-posts-comics/).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/may/elitistarmory_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/may/elitistarmory.jpg)<br />
<br />
Elitist Armory (http://elitistarmory.com) is done by the author of Elitist Group, as with Elitist Group it gives you information on what kind of equipment, gems and enchants a player is using. It also tries to show you information you need, rather than just giving you everything and the kitchen sink.<br />
<br />
I’ll be lazy and steal the examples used on the website, Shadow (http://elitistarmory.com/us/mal'ganis/shadow) is a perfect profile, while Amarand (http://elitistarmory.com/us/mal'ganis/amarand) has multiple item and talent issues.<br />
<br />
Powered by<br />
You can add support for tooltips showing Elitist Armory information by using the powered by (http://elitistarmory.com/powered) support, all you have to do is include a little bit of Javascript.<br />
<br />
Guild<br />
The guild feature will allow you to quickly see how good and how accurate your raid teams gear is. This guild (http://elitistarmory.com/g/us/mal'ganis/internet%20relay%20chat/0/9) is probably not going to be killing 25-man heroic Lich King anytime soon!<br />
<br />
Equipment, gems and enchants<br />
Items are categorized into their basic types by stats. Items with defense rating are tank items or if they have spell power then it’s a caster item. Players are classified into a tank, caster dps, melee dps or range dps role depending on their talents and profiles are built based on if an item is useful for them. A Hunter would be penalized for wearing items with Spirit, while a Holy Priest would not.<br />
<br />
Unlike Elitist Group, it will also warn players who are Jewelcrafters, but don’t have three Dragon’s Eyes socketed, or Blacksmiths who aren’t using their extra sockets. It will even show a players gear for both of their specs if it’s available.<br />
<br />
It includes basic searching for item upgrades by their type, such as finding upgrades for Boots of Wintry Endurance (http://elitistarmory.com/item/45565/spirit-healer).<br />
<br />
Dungeon experience<br />
Rather than showing experience by a long list of achievements, you can a simple summarized percent based on the same numbers used in Elitist Group. Dungeon experience is broken down by number of players and by heroic vs normal difficulty. Claiming a character (http://elitistarmory.com/faq#claim), will let you show your main characters experience if you play a lot of alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because they've shown us this part of Gilneas before right? Not. This shot is completely new, as it's also the first shot of Gilneas outside of the city. And how dare Blizzard not give away the entire game with their screenshots?!<br />
<br />
P.S. Do want Cata now plx. cannot wait to see that area as mah worgen.<br />

<br />
It doesn't take into considerations the fact that Feral druids can be DPS &amp; Tank, and instead classes them as &quot;Melee DPS&quot;.<br />
<br />
My Feral Tank had a rating ofl like 35% because i was apparantly &quot;gemming and speccing&quot; wrong.<br />

I use it regularly and the queue is mostly of 1-2 people... Thank you MMO-C! ;P<br />
<br />
Anyway - It is a very good alternative to GS. It tells you what is wrong with the gear + the avg. iLvl. Who cares if the player has 7k GS when wearing nothing nut PvP gear and has never set foot in ICC?<br />
<br />
A new feature that came up yesterday is a link from the ingame add-on to the site. If you paste the link from a party or raid, it'll show you a nice overview of these people. Very helpful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes and no, a feral tank is going to have a few talents for them to be &quot;actual&quot; tanks rather than hybriding and trying to do both roles. Right now it requires at any combination of at least 3 of these: 3/3 Thick Hide, 1/1 Survival Instincts, 3/3 Natural Reaction, 3/3 Protector of the Pack to be considered tanks. If you want to link your profile, or PM me the link I can look into it further.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When I try to use that site to find my guild it says 'you are 1285 in the queue'? it has been sat there for about 10 mins already.<br />
<br />
<br />
The load is making it occasionally time out which causes the queue number to not update, if you refresh it'll give you a new number. I'm fixing that right now.<br />
<br />
I can't do much about the queues being higher, that's just due to the load that MMO-Champion generates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Mostly it comes down to a single point of failure, namely the DB. I'm working on setting up something like Amazon EC2s to handle the extra load, but at a certain point the DB can only process so many requests before it slows down.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Addons like that are completely useless. They are handy for those avid guildless puggers(why on earth do that), but how many are there of those? Alts wont have much completed.<br />

for raiding there is no viable spec that you can do both well in, the last time you could was when naxx was current. so you are doing it wrong. you're either a bad tank spec or a bad dps spec. the site is right.</div></div><hr />

I was specced as a full-on tank, not a Hybrid.<br />
<br />
Even though i was specced, geared, gemmed and chanted as a tank, it classed me as Feral DPS and said all my choices were wrong.<br />

People need to understand how a caching system works. If there hasn't been ANY active interest in a profile there's no point in this website keeping your profile updated. It's a waste of bandwidth and computing power. On any normal day you'd have an up to date version to look at, but currently there's so much traffic that the server just can't handle it right now.<br />
<br />
Try again in a couple days, and it should be back to working as intended.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was Blasted Lands too at first; it is indeed the same tree model and the ground reminds of it (it's red grass actually), but if you check with you-know-what, you'll find out it's really Gilneas, precisely a zone called The Blackwald.</div></div><hr />

The screenshot of the day is actually not of Gilnaes. It's a picture of the Tainted Forest, the zone replacing the Tainted Scar in the Blasted Lands. I'd recognize that tree anywhere!<br />
<br />
<br />
As a few of us have pointed out now;<br />
a) WoW's Twitter Page has it listed a Gilneas.<br />
b) Compare today's and yesterday's (which WAS the revamped tainted scar zone) SSotD and play spot the difference.<br />
c) Do not assume without facts. i.e. please don't claim some IS something unless you know without any doubt that you're right.<br />
<br />
Also, a little research, such as going on to youtube and doing a search for Gilneas will prove, without doubt, that this is Gilneas. However, I suggest only viewing the video if you don't mind seeing things now instead of when you finally get a chance to get in there yourself. [i](just discovered that the particular video that shows the area doesn't appear unless you search for the uploaders name as well. Herecius)</div></div><hr />

Character data is cached on their server. You need to tell the site to reload your data from the WoW Armory (which is *exactly* what the long queues everyone is talking about are).</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has been said before, but obviously since dimwits like you continue to post the same garbage over and over:<br />
<br />
You do realize that if it did this there would be even longer queues? Not to mention there's no point in updating, for example, my characters as I am not even playing the game right now. If the site actively checked my Armory every other day to see if there was updates it would be wasting server resources that could be used to update someone who is requesting their info be updated on EA because they are playing. Wasting resources on unknown variables is staggeringly stupid.<br />

You single-handedly crashed ElitistArmory by putting it on MMO-Champ's front page. Now they're having to go into overtime to fix it because it's not working at all.<br />
<br />
You broke the internet, I hope you are proud of yourself. :P</div></div><hr />

It's Gilneas. Go back a page or two, we've already confirmed this.</div></div><hr />

ElitistArmory would be awesome if it didn't have out of date character data (should just &quot;fetch&quot; current armory profiles tbh instead of caching character data) and it doesn't really tell me very much more than wow-heroes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard throttles armory requests to roughly 1 per a second by region. Currently, since EA is self funded I can't toss money at it to increase my throughput. Meaning I'm limited to about 40,000 new characters per day, including refreshes that is around 42,000-45,000. Currently I have around 2,400,000 characters cached, if I were to try keeping absolute up to date information it would take me 30 - 50 days to do a full refresh.<br />
<br />
Every armory site has this limitation, you just don't tend to notice it.</div></div><hr />

The queue counter was breaking the site, I have to rewrite it and that will take a day or two.</div></div><hr />

You would have to be more specific, it pulls form the EU armory fine.</div></div><hr />

I personally wouldn't expect the site to be working for a couple days after it's been MMO-Champ'ed, but the immediate updates, extra work and even hanging around these forums to reply to people is pretty damn impressive. Really, hats off to you guys, and keep up the great work. :3</div></div><hr />

Thanks! All of the queue and load issues should be resolved at this point, and the queue is slow enough that individual requests are completed within 10-30 seconds, and guild requests within a few minutes.</div></div><hr />
