<br />
Only the Death Knight, Hunter, Mage, Warlock, Rogue (Female), and Priest sets are currently in the game files. The other sets are just not here.<br />
We call them Tier 8 armor because they're labeled as the &quot;G&quot; sets in the game files. Basically the warlock set is named RaidWarlock_G_, RaidWarlock_A_ is the Tier 1 set, B Tier 2, etc ... Obviously G should be the 7th tier but this one reused the old tier 3 &quot;C&quot; models.<br />
Most of these models have been here since the beta, they might not be representative anymore of what the final sets will look like in Patch 3.1. Wait a few more weeks before complaining about it. <br />
No, there isn't any music or sound.<br />

Patch 3.0.8a Download<br />
Mirrors for the small bug fix patch are still available. Don't forget, downloading from third-party sites is NEVER safe and you should ALWAYS use the Blizzard Downloader if you have the choice. Moving the patch to your WoW folder and running the downloader to let it check the file is also a good idea. <br />

New Arena Matchmaking System Overview<br />
We recently introduced a new Arena matchmaking system with the intent of better matching up players against opponents of similar skill level, and to address potential abuses under the old system. We realize that many players have questions regarding the new system, and as such, we would like to provide more insight into the new matchmaking system.<br />
<br />
First and foremost, the primary goal of the new Arena matchmaking system is to match players against opponents of similar skill, regardless of your or your opponents’ team rating. This means that once an estimated skill level is determined, you will more likely be matched against other players of a similar skill level. Please note that the estimated skill level is constantly being evaluated and will adjust based on each team’s continual performance. Ratings that are won or lost also take into account skill level, so that you will not suffer a high penalty if you lose against a team that is much better than their actual team rating. <br />
Another important aspect of this new Arena matchmaking system is a smaller range of maximum rating that can be won or lost. Because of the differences between how the new system assigns rating points at the end of a match, we are still tweaking rating gain versus loss per match to improve the experience. <br />
If you were previously ranked with a high skill level and decide to create a new team, it should now be much easier to reach your team’s correct rating. This ensures that players will not feel penalized for moving between teams, and high ranked teams will not feel penalized for trying out new players without much risk to the team rating itself. <br />
Finally, the core and fundamental reason for the new Arena matchmaking system is for players to participate in Arena games that are fun. We feel that with this new system, higher ranked players will most likely find the challenges that they seek, newer players will no longer feel that Arenas are closed to them, and players will not feel as penalized for trying new things in the Arenas. <br />
<br />
We like the way that matchmaking works in the new system and feel that it is working as expected. However, we acknowledge that there are some aspects of the way rating is calculated under the new system that could use some tweaking. As with all things, your enjoyment of the game and its systems are very important us, and this system was implemented in an effort to further promote the enjoyment of the Arenas. As always, we welcome your feedback and would constantly be striving to make this system even better. <br />

Mana regeneration<br />
We think mana regen is too trivial at the moment in PvE and just right or too difficult in PvP (depending on the class). Now part of that is because the content is easy. Part of it is because we’ve given players a lot of reasons to avoid having to worry about the FSR. Part of it is just generous talents (like Illumination). Part of it was the change to let Int scale regen to some degree. The whole package is something we’re looking at. Mana regen is supposed to be part of the game – you aren’t supposed to graduate out of it with enough gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14637264068-why-are-priests-considered-a-hybrid-class.html))<br />
<br />
Question: would not it be simpler for Devs, Class Designers and Boss Designers not to have to deal with the FSR, and rework the mana regen system and simplify it between healing classes ? (I've never heard about a DPS class running oom anymore, as they did in Vanilla) Eventually change talents and values around it, and rework Spirit too to make it a more valuable stat for all classes ? (why would warriors not put some Spirit to really boost their health regen ?)<br />
I think you can make a good argument that the pendulum has swung back towards Spirit and away from mp5. I think long term the whole system is in need of an update or re-design, but this is not a 3.1 level task.

Buff system overhaul in WotLK<br />
We overhauled the buff system pretty dramatically and there are going to be some rough edges. We are currently in the process of evaluating when the same buff is not truly equal, because one class gets it passively for example, or one class doesn’t have to talent for it. Saying that a buff isn’t useful because every raid *always* has some other spec is not persuasive in our minds because we are explicitly designing around the assumption that you may not have one of every spec. (Minus a few gimmick encounters like Raz that we are carefully evaluating.) Divine Spirit is a good example of something that looked like it would be competitive with other versions of the same buff, but feels like it falls short in practice. Therefore we plan on changing it. <br />
<br />
[...] Even if it is shared more, 10% crit is a very powerful raid debuff -- probably too powerful. There is a melee debuff that is equally game-changing, which is something else we would like to fix. <br />
<br />
[...] We don’t think Heroism / Bloodlust is 100% necessary. It’s a very nice buff to be sure but it is nothing like it was in BC. Because any shaman can bring it, it’s also going to be more common than say a buff that shows up as someone’s 31 point talent.

WWS Reports on official forums<br />
We like numbers. It's awesome when players post them. However, understand that if it was as simple as players just posting WWS or other stats, then all you are really doing is linking to data that we can go gather ourselves.<br />
<br />
The reason we like seeing players discuss numbers is the discussion. It's great when someone says &quot;Yeah, I get numbers like that too,&quot; or &quot;Hmmm. Those numbers look suspicious,&quot; or &quot;Wow, were you exploiting a bug?&quot; or &quot;Yeah, I can get those numbers but only if I am really lucky with a complex rotation,&quot; or &quot;I can do that with this spec but not some other spec, so picking these talents may mean a 20% dps increase.&quot; That is all information we can use that goes much deeper than just &quot;Ret pallies do 4000 dps&quot; (or whatever).<br />
<br />
It's not realistic to expect the community to come to a consensus on anything, even what dps various specs can achieve. But you can see trends. You can see the issues that come up. You can see when things are controversial or confusing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14697489850-so-are-wws-and-wowmeteronline-useless.html))<br />

Blood of the North<br />
Blood of the North was the first of the Death Rune talents we implemented, largely to fill a hole in the deep Frost tree. At the time it needed to be 5 points or Frost had to backtrack a lot in order to go deeper.<br />
<br />
But the other two trees ended up with cheaper versions of the talent and Frost has changed so much that I don't know that it needs to be 5 points any longer. This is something we might look at for 3.1. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14637475185-blood-of-the-north.html))<br />

Shadow of Death<br />
We will be applying a hotfix that will make it so that it will no longer be possible to use this while in Arenas. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/14637464100-shadow-of-death.html))<br />

Beast Mastery is over-nerfed and could be buffed before Ulduar<br />
We talked about it a great deal today and agreed that we probably over-nerfed BM. Marks is in a good spot and Survival might be too high once we look at the changes we are making to all other classes.<br />
<br />
Our plan is to buff BM before Ulduar, but I can't give you a timetable more detailed than that, and things could change for any number of reasons. We are unlikely to touch Steady Shot for the reasons I have mentioned before. We are more likely to look at Kindred Spirits and Serpents Swiftness again.<br />
<br />
Again, huge caveats: Predicting changes we are discussing making but haven't made yet is fraught with peril. I only wanted to address this issue because it caused a lot of consternation in the community.<br />
<br />
I don't mind admitting when we make a mistake in the hope that it builds our credibility in the community. This was one. It won't be the last. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14578748409-hunter-bm-and-mm-are-broken.html))<br />

Arcane Nerf in 3.0.8<br />
1. Arcane Barrage can no longer clip arcane missles for the arcane blast buff (figured this would be fixed soon).<br />
2. Arcane Blast Glyph is apparently only 3% per stack instead of 5%.<br />
3. Arcane Blast Glyph bonus damage is no longer applied to arcane missiles.<br />
<br />
1. This change was by design. While it might have been a fun test of skill, the fact is that Arcane is probably too powerful in PvE and PvP and we didn't want to make matters worse with this little trick.<br />
2. This change was also by design. As many players have pointed out, it was just too good.<br />
3. This is a bug likely caused by the previous two changes. Such is the risk of making changes quickly. We can hotfix this bug out though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14697589662-real-classy-stealth-arcane-nerf.html))<br />

Paladin damage in Naxxramas<br />
Another issue I have hinted at before is that a lot of Rets will claim &quot;Naxx is full of undead. We should win the meters or otherwise we never will.&quot; While it is logical to reach that conclusion, we don't actually like the design of Ret doing great dps in some instances and not on others based on the type of creature. Assume that the damage you do in Naxx is what we want you to do all the time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14697489850-so-are-wws-and-wowmeteronline-useless.html))<br />

Ritual of Summoning<br />
The Warlock Ritual of Summoning was corrected in two stages. The first stage you patched with 3.0.8a and the second stage was applied via a hotfix. It should now be functioning correctly. Please feel free to let us know if there are any further issues. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14697589958-summoning-is-broken-still.html))<br />

Ppl told you to not use Naxxrammas (or any &quot;undead party&quot; place) as the standard damage when balancing (nerfing) Ret paladins.<br />
<br />
Now they're all &quot;omg, we forgot the increased dmg output against undeads! Ulduar won't have undeads!&quot;<br />
<br />
Just like Karazhan full of undeads/demons against other raids in TBC.<br />
<br />
And that's funny, because against undead/demons, Ret paladins have more dmg output thanks to talents AND extra attacks, so they should be at least on par or very close with pure dps classes (using the 5% diference between pure and hybrid) that doesn't care about the type of the mob.<br />

<br />
Having to mind control the trainees for the raz fight is what makes it different and interesting. As it is in the 10 man with the channeling stones, the tanks are the ones who do that so you might as well just not bother with the mechanic in the first place and just have another tired tank rotation fight. We already will likely never see a fight where a warrior's spell reflect is needed, and I can image we will soon find things like spell steal or warlock tanking requirements to be extinct as well.<br />
<br />
But when you have healers with 1k bonus healing and dps who can just barely manage to pump out 1500 dps on a tank and spank boss requesting invites to heroics and raids, you see the kind of imbeciles Blizzard is targeting this game towards now.</div></div><hr />

I did. However, he excluded the class/spec of him and his partner, he excluded info about how they usually do, who drops first, who survives, etc. You know, and the stuff Blizz count as &quot;skill&quot; (while I have no real idea just how it goes down, I believe it has something to do with the player's performance in the match, not just the win or loss of the team itself). How well geared is he? How well geared is his friend? Gear is taken in consideration as well. So... what else was there to read if not QQ?

There are two ratings, good sir. Team rating, and personal rating. Now, the ghost rating is the third one, and it seems to be something between the two. Personal rating is gained by the player's performance. Not the team's performance, player's. That is something new, something that many people can't grasp. Personal rating is no longer based about how many games you played and won, it now is about HOW WELL you play in your team. Seems to me that his friend is carrying him trough, but the poster is afraid to say that, because usually these kinds of posts (such as yours) are made by exactly that kind of people. No real proof, no information, just QQ about how that is OP, that is stupid and how they are entitled for more.</div></div><hr />

Stupid system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stupid because you cannot be carried trough anymore? Aww. Just as your team is rated (where the TEAMWORK is rated), you also get a personal rating (where YOUR INDIVIDUAL performance is rated). Your team might be uber, but that does not have to prevent you be the deadweight of the team due to inability or slacking. Hell, as long as the rest of the group is good, you can do 0 thousand and 469 dps in a 10 man Naxx. Yes, your group still kills the boss, but clearly you do not deserve the loot, because you are a dead weight for the group, only a slot filler and they could do just as well without you. I anticipate your next &quot;BAWW IT STUPID&quot; comment without backing up anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
My partner and i are at equal rating. What i don't understand is that when we lose against a team that is obviously better geared and higher rating, they gain 5 but we lose 14. Is this intended? Are you always supposed to lose more rating than you gain? I miss not feeling totally terrible about unequal matchups because we'd only lose a few points....<br />
<br />
Possibly this is being done to seperate your team and the higher geared and rated one. While you are less geared, thus moved down, to be matched with about equally geared players. This is a rather complex system, which was not wise to implement in the middle of a season, and in time it should slowly stabilize. It requires huge amount of observational data about your performance, so it cannot be 100% correct towards you at the first week it went live.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MuTe</div><div class="date">2009-01-28, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new arena system DOES suck because of the following reason.<br />
<br />
U wont be matched again vs ppl that have same teamrating anymore (to prevent &quot;skilled&quot; ppl at low ratings to pwn &quot;bad&quot; ppl with low ratings and farm there way up). Instead u will face teams with the same &quot;invisible&quot; skill level as you. The skill level will not only be based on gear, but also on, survivability, teamwork, kills, dmg/heals, tactics and stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Now im a skilled player, its arguable ofc, but ive had 2.2k+ rating in all previous seasons, and multiple servers top teams. However, im at 1650 rating atm because im facing 2.2k teams.<br />
For the record, i play a Surv hunter with a Disc priest. Both have some savage, hatefull, and a few deadly's which can be obtained by farming 1650/1700 rating.<br />
<br />
Because my skill and gear level is rated &quot;high&quot; i'm suppose to win vs 2.2k rated paladins and dk's. (and we face them all the time). When we win, we get 7 teamrating and like 12 personal, and the opponent loses like 15 teamrating. When we lose, i lose like 12 teamrating, but more like 17 personal. This way its really really hard to match your personal with your teams rating. As well its almost impossible to get your rating up. If i win 2 battles, and lose 1 ive gained nothing. This does not make any scense.<br />
<br />
Also, i am farming gear so i can become better for arena. Instead im getting punished for having good gear, and i face ppl who are same &quot;skilled&quot;, but have a way better combo like PALA/DK, PALA/Rogue etc. Sure i can find a better combo, but i though they wanted to make every spec/class valid for pve and pvp?<br />
<br />
At the moment i will always face ppl that the arena system considers good, and ill never face bad players. Every arena match is a hard challenge, and the rating won is always low, and the rating lost is always high. The better gear i get, the more ill lose vs the really good teams, or really imbalanced setups.<br />
<br />
If blizzards idea of this new system is to make arena more fun, then they really missed the ball here. Arena is really hard atm, and PVE is really easy. Nice balance indeed..</div></div><hr />

It's not stupid at all. If this example holds true often, it means shite players can't get carried by better ones into gear they don't deserve. *TEAM* exploitation is the behavior being addressed, so damn right that one guy gets to buy and the other doesn't. <br />

<br />
I do like a challenge, but not at 1650 rating when im still farming better gear (wich i cant get). The reall challenge should be around 1900+ ratings. Thats why the ratings of those deadly set pieces are so high, it should be a challenge to get them.<br />
<br />
However it should not be mindblowing hard to get hatefull hands (1615) rating. And to win 3 matches to get +7 rating when uve lost 1. Especially with 5 minute ques on my server the &quot;fun&quot; part is really gone out the window. People who are skilled dont want to play weeks and weeks of arena to get past 1700 rating. Also its a punishement for new people to join a team, cause they will never be able to raise their personal, because at 1500 personal, but &quot;invisible 2k&quot; they will have a really hard time to raise that.<br />
<br />
Also take into consideration that PVP is even more imbalanced then it was in previous seasons, and that its mostly DK, Pala, mage, and rogue that hold the top teams, and thus have a way easier time to get gear, and face easier teams with same skill level according to the matchmaking.<br />
<br />
What i wonder. If you get the really easy raid epics and go arena with them. Would the matchmaking system rate you as skilled? Since the purpose of PVE gear is not PVP! it should suck in PVE, and you should want to have PVP gear to survive, which u currently do not.</div></div><hr />

If you are skilled enough, you will rise in rating. If you stay in the same rating weeks and weeks on end, you should reconsider, maybe that rating is your place, your current skill roof? You can claim yourself being extremely skilled and all, but if you stick in the same rating for so long, allow for me to disagree.<br />
<br />
Also, &quot;the real challenge should start at 1900&quot;. So what, you want to faceroll your way up to there? Then the equal chance should be given to every scrub out there, but it is impossible for 10 out of 11,5 million players to be at 1900 rating. It is a ladder, and if you are in the bottom and have no strength to climb up, then the ladder is not at fault. It is you.<br />

I haven't done arena since the patch, but I disagree with what you're saying. If what he's saying is true and he's been assigned an invisible rating of 2.2k and is constantly fighting 2.2k-ish teams, if he has 50% win-loss, he should gradually make his way to the 2.2k rating. However, from the sounds of it, v. 2.2k rated teams, a win yields less TR than a loss removes while he is in the 1650's. That goes completely against what the post said:<br />
<br />
&quot;If you were previously ranked with a high skill level and decide to create a new team, it should now be much easier to reach your team’s correct rating.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you fight on a roughly even ground with 2.2k rated teams, imo your &quot;correct rating&quot; is 2.2k, and the way they worded the system is that it would make it easier to get there (I assume they meant fewer games played,otherwise why not just q them v. 1200 rated teams but give them 32 TR per game, or just let them start the team at the invisible rating?<br />
<br />
As far as it accounting for everything you do in a match, I think there are flaws in that too. I think judging that is far too complex for them to rate. If I trinket a cheap shot do I get downrated, even though v. some teams (only time I do it), I'm dead before the CS ends unless i trinket it? If I mana burn the opponent, does it count as me &quot;doing good&quot; even if the opponent doesn't go OOM? Do they rate you on how quickly you dispel stuff? Different comps are played different ways, will I be downrated for not mass dispelling a bubble when the goal was to force the bubble, but we don't plan to utilize the bubble being gone till after a few CD's come up (and i don't wanna waste the mana to mass dispel for no reason if, for instance, we're waiting for my fear cd to be nearly up to get a CC combo on pally+finish off his partner). It also can't calculate other stuff like when you're a bit low on mana and you see an opening, your partner has cd's up, he tells you to go drink and he'll be fine, and he dies b/c he fails to use his cd's at the right time. Does it count against you for trying to drink or your partner for failing to appropriately use his CDs? It can't assume background conversations...If it weren't established that I was going to drink, my not healing is my fault.<br />

There are just way too many variables that blizz won't always have, so if that's how they do it, it's bugged.</div></div><hr />

Your &quot;skill&quot; level is based on the combined average of your ilevel of gear (even in bank slots).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, I have asked this before but have never gotten a response.<br />
<br />
Where exactly did a blue ever post that your &quot;skill&quot; level is based off of your gear (including bank slots)?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it isn't true, I just want to figure out once and for all where so many people came up with this claim, please someone come up with a link where a blue actually posted officially this is how the new system works!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balbaroy</div><div class="date">2009-01-28, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">holy crap this new arena rating is so confusing lol. I remember a time when I used to be able to understand what rating meant and like, how much i should be getting after a game was done. I haven't really played with it that much because arenas in general are crap right now, so hopefully it'll dawn on me eventually. All I know is my personal rating is 70 points lower than my team rating :/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MuTe</div><div class="date">2009-01-28, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you are skilled enough, you will rise in rating. If you stay in the same rating weeks and weeks on end, you should reconsider, maybe that rating is your place, your current skill roof? You can claim yourself being extremely skilled and all, but if you stick in the same rating for so long, allow for me to disagree.<br />
<br />
Also, &quot;the real challenge should start at 1900&quot;. So what, you want to faceroll your way up to there? Then the equal chance should be given to every scrub out there, but it is impossible for 10 out of 11,5 million players to be at 1900 rating. It is a ladder, and if you are in the bottom and have no strength to climb up, then the ladder is not at fault. It is you.<br />
<br />
Oh, and about the gear... do VoA, it is free pvp epix for absolutely no effort.<br />
<br />
<br />
1st i havent said im stuck at the same rating weeks after weeks. I said if i WIN a match i get 7 rating. If i LOSE a match i lose 12+ meaning i have to win 3 out of 4 battles to gain rating. Does this seem fair to you? Inmagine u play vs 2k+ rated teams all the time and win 7 each game. GL getting to 2k with that kind of progression.<br />
<br />
Besided, ppl who have 2.2k rating now will also face ppl with 1500, but with a high skill level. They will also lose more rating then win. Eventually there is gonna be an avarage rating for everyone. My team pulls itself up from 2k rated, and 2k rated get pulled down by 1500. At the end well all end up in 1800 bracket.<br />
<br />
Ill give another example for why this system sucks:<br />
<br />
According to blizzard the Survival hunter requires more skill to play, thus puts out more dmg if played well. On the other hand, the BM hunter is an easier spec to play, thus requires less skill to play and therefor the spec does less dmg.<br />
<br />
Now define &quot;Skill&quot;. IMO it takes more skill to get, lets say 2k rating as a BM hunter since he does less dmg, has no cc, has no survivability.<br />
Survival on the other hand has alot of abilities, does more dmg, and can help the healer alot more then a BM can. So he requires more skill?<br />
<br />
Point is, you cant define what skill is. And you should not be ranked at the way you play. If you as a druid pillar kite every match, and throw a few hots on ur prot warrior and win match after match, you are ranked skilled.. roflmao</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blahblahnameblah</div><div class="date">2009-01-28, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: So when you say HR tracks &quot;skill&quot;, it's still solely based on win/losses and such through your history of arenas, and does not vary based on class/gear/comps?<br />
<br />
Blue: This is correct. <br />
<br />
From what I can tell from reading the Blue posts is that the Matchmaking system tracks your wins / losses through (I assume here) the season (although they do say history, so who knows: they might even be including TBC Arena as well, which is ludicrous considering how much some classes have changed).<br />
Which means (theoretically) that if a team brings in a &quot;ringer&quot; to help boost their ratings, the ringer's overall rating (let's say he's won 80% of his matches this season) will be included rather than ignored in that teams horrific 1450 rating.<br />
<br />
For those people noticing the difference between personal and team rating, the Blue mentioned that this is going to be adjusted so that personal rating converges towards the team rating rather than converge towards the matchmaking rating as it is currently. <br />
So those of us who have been seeing a difference between those two should see them stabilized / converge in the future.<br />
<br />
Eversor: The amount of misinformation in your posts is epic fail.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ishir</div><div class="date">2009-01-28, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a bit puzzled.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, the rating system was originally implemented to show someone's skill in PvP arena - higher rating meant you were better.<br />
<br />
Now they've introduced an &quot;invisible&quot; rating which, from the Blizz comments that I've read, is supposed to more accurately match you up against opponents - i.e. skill.<br />
<br />
So what does the visible rating actually measure? Is it just an arbitrary number? Why not replace it with a win-loss record then? Or change personal rating to the new invisible rating?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what I thought all along. The reason I thought this:<br />
My partner and I have only played games on 2 teams this season: our 2v2 and our 3v3. We both have played 100% of the games. Our gear is very different.<br />
<br />
Our personal rating has been identical every game this season.<br />
<br />
There is no way it would be identical every single game considering we have very different gear, and do very different things in the arena. No way is our personal rating based on damage/healing/dispels/gear.</div></div><hr />

Quote from: Aratil (Source)<br />
I clicked on the tab in the first blue post... then read the thread.<br />
<br />
and Ds_swoosh... yeah, I agree it's not working as intended, or flawed at the least, but...<br />
The wowriot article &quot;example&quot; is not only pure speculation, it's wrong, and wrong headed. <br />
It is not gear based, pure and simple. I have one team atm, I have mixed hateful/deadly full pvp gear, my buddy has none. <br />
We get the same PR every match we play. <br />
There is quite a bit of difference in the overall ilvl of our gear.<br />
The gear = skill is a myth.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MuTe</div><div class="date">2009-01-29, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say test the syetem yourself and come to your own conculsions.<br />
<br />
What blue thinks happens and what it actually does are 2 different things. (I would never call blue a liar ofc ;) )<br />
<br />
Have a read here - http://wowriot.gameriot.com/blogs/World-of-Ming/308-Blizzard-Ruins-Arena-New-Death-Knight-Specs<br />
<br />
Test it yourself, then tell me that blue is correct. I'm sure you will see it isn't working &quot;as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
Lets not forget blizzard already admitted to making one mistake with it, and it didn't work as intended once already.<br />
<br />
<br />
This article was written the 21st of Januari, and has been hot fixed. The bug was that even on lose, the personal rating would go up instead of down. This doesnt happen anymore. When playing around 20 arena matches yesterday im still keep getting +7 team rating for wins, and are now getting -5 team rating on lose instead of the -12 i had before. Maybe the system has adjusted something about my skill level or something, but now i dont have to win 3 games to make up for 1 lose.<br />
<br />
However, ive been playing roughly around 100 arena matches since i joined this team, and my personal rating is not getting closer to the teamrating what so ever. Also +7 rating on wins isnt really much, and i now have to play twice as much arena to get the rating i desire then before this matchmaking system.</div></div><hr />

Is there like two PvE hunter versions, and two PvP hunter versions of the set, or is it just so that you can decide how you want to look?<br />
A bit confused.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Holy poo, I am silly. 10 man and 25 man.<br />
Thanks me. xD</div></div><hr />
