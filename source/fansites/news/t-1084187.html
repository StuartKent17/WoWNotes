A lot of people have been asking me when we should expect a MoP beta or more updates on the game, and the answer to that question is simple: soon. All the recent events indicate that the internal alpha testing already started:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The old WoW2 Battle.net accounts used for the Cataclysm Beta have finally been removed from some players Battle.net pages.<br />
The recent update of the official talent calculator had multiple spells tagged as &quot;NYI&quot; (Not Yet Implemented). This is what we see in Alpha/Beta stages of the game to indicate that a spell doesn't work in-game yet. <br />
Community Managers have posted actual screenshots of new spells tooltips in-game. It means they have a server they can easily connect to for that, and it's most likely the biggest proof. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Now what does it mean for players? First, let's be clear, this is the internal alpha and it is different from the Friend &amp; Family Alpha where non-Blizzard employees can play as long as they know someone in the company. This one would be restricted to employees only and Blizzard executives are probably watching anything happening there very closely. <br />
<br />
However, it definitely means that if everything goes well we should see a Friend &amp; Family Alpha or a Beta within one or two month, and the Mists of Pandaria press tour on March 19 is most likely a way to prepare fansites to that. For Cataclysm, the press tour happened about 2 weeks before the start of the closed beta. <br />

NAO Invitational Tournament<br />
Curse (http://www.curse.com/), Skill-Capped (http://www.skill-capped.com/), and Logitech (http://www.logitech.com/en-us/gaming) are sponsoring a player run Arena tournament with over $4000 in prizes. You can find the list of prizes on ArenaJunkies (http://www.arenajunkies.com/news/429-nao-invitationals-2-prizes/). See the structure and rules (http://www.arenajunkies.com/topic/217764-nao-invitational-tournament-2/) for more information about how the teams are selected. <br />
<br />
This tournament will not allow 4.3 PvE gear and will have the final matches later this evening. <br />

Those 3 points are interesting with the 3rd one seeming as the strongest one but is it really? Technically they had a server with MoP up on Blizzcon already, people played as pandas there. And it would seem logical they will have some test realm as soon as there is something to put on it but calling it alpha testing seems... Not correct let's say.</div></div><hr />

Better not be, considering what they sacrificed from cataclysm to speed up MoP development. No later then June IMO. They scrapped 6 months worth of content for MoP to come out 6 month sooner, it better come out 6 month sooner.</div></div><hr />

Or they almost had buying mop? i believe it was add to months, meaning they wanted u to try the game out with annual pass, aka it would come out early.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normally i would say that you are going delusional, but since they have to do a closed alpha, then a friends and family beta, then the open beta. Im afraid you might be right!. We might see MoP on August or late October, and the whole Diablo 3 deal was a way to keep people subscribed untill MoP without releasing new content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming it follows the same pattern as Cata, then Beta starts in April, 2 or 3 months of beta (loads of people to test the expansion this time round and no 1-60 levelling content to fix too) and a lovely Summer release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
April or May??? Are you NUTS? If the INTERNAL alpha is underway mid-February, that probably means we (won't) see the F&amp;F alpha around the timeframe you mentioned, perhaps a tad sooner. That means Beta testing underway mid-late summer, if we're lucky. Which probably means a 2013 release.<br />
<br />
Best case scenario would involve everything happening a month or so earlier than I predicted above, which would have to include Blizzard somehow finishing a game promptly for a change. If this were the case, that would put us at a late late 2012 release (ie: holiday release).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eon Drache</div><div class="date">2012-02-19, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard waiting till December this time would make it a hell of a lot worse for them as a company then releasing it now would. Also, finally a video that makes dragon soul look somewhat epic in the first 3 minutes. Blizzard failed at making it feel like a real raid to go for this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knowing how bad is blizz to sticking to deadlines , my guess is MoP will be out around December :(<br />
Yes, this points out - just as I said times before - MoP will be release at the start of december :-P <br />
Now Internal Alpha, March F&amp;F Alpha, Summer Beta till at least November and release in December cause you cant forget Blizzard<br />
has to release D3 &amp; SC2 Addon 1 before MoP....<br />
<br />
<br />
And then subscriptions will go down to what,five million?:p<br />

A lot of people don't play in the summer, so Blizz could risk making a real flop with a summer release. Fall is good, December (=Christmas) is probably best, and they do like to drag out release times. Unfortunately, another year of Dragon Soul just isn't going to cut it and it will hurt the game. They really need to work on their timing with these expansions to reduce the amount of wait time between the last tier of the old content and the first tier of the new. We're already sitting at round 2-3 months of Dragon Soul.</div></div><hr />

March press tour saying that closed beta starts in a few weeks. Beta starting early-mid April. I'm guessing 3-4 months and there you have your July/August release. It won't release later than that I'm guessing due to the sales call in August.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tilgare</div><div class="date">2012-02-19, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BC beta: 3 months<br />
WOTLK beta: 4 months<br />
Cataclysm beta: 5 months<br />
<br />
Yep, I did the math and came up with that as well. I think the Cataclysm beta was just longer because it was such a massive overhaul of the game... so let's assume a 4 month beta for MoP instead of 6 months. I don't think we'll see a 3 month beta again like we did in BC, but anything is possible - depends entirely on the amount of internal testing they've gotten done.<br />
<br />
If we get F&amp;F Alpha in the next 2-4 weeks, and Closed Beta about 2-4 weeks after that (ie, 2 weeks after the press event), we could conceivably see release EARLY Q3 which would stick pretty closely to their 6 month content cycles. We got Dragon Soul in early December, so if you estimated with only that in mind, you'd guess approximately June for release. July isn't much further off and we would get our systems update in May-June anyways to tide us over.</div></div><hr />

If the INTERNAL alpha is underway mid-February, that probably means we (won't) see the F&amp;F alpha around the timeframe you mentioned, perhaps a tad sooner. That means Beta testing underway mid-late summer, if we're lucky. Which probably means a 2013 release.<br />
<br />
Best case scenario would involve everything happening a month or so earlier than I predicted above, which would have to include Blizzard somehow finishing a game promptly for a change. If this were the case, that would put us at a late late 2012 release (ie: holiday release).<br />
<br />
There is no way its a 2013 release lmfao. Do you honestly think blizz can keep people playing for another 10 months?</div></div><hr />

ye i agree, ive said all along to people i bet it wont be out untill the annual pass is up, for me i hope it isnt at least that way i can try the beta and if i dont like it i dont have to buy the expansion and be bothered about still having to pay for something i wont be logging into.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't make any sense, even from a corporate greed spin. If they were greedy, they would want to retain as many of those players as possible. Seeing how those players will be subscribed either way, Blizzard's &quot;greed&quot; would dictate that they retain those players AFTER the pass is up. Do they do this by delaying content from players, making them bored and more likely to quit the game? Or do they give them a new expansion fill with more content to keep the subscribing long after the annual pass is up? <br />
<br />
Your argument comes down to, &quot;it's a super smart move to have your players sit in year old content in order to get them to come back for another year harp a larp&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While the setting in Dragonblight is tied closely to dragon lore, it's position in Northrend, coupled with the fact that its covered in ice and snow, and not excluding that it was already quite a dull zone, makes it starkly different from where I think the final battle between the heroes and the crazed, molten, lava-spewing final boss raid should occur. Combine this with bosses that have no previous stake in lore, nor any real established relevance. In contrast, examine ICC- professor putricide may have had no previous mention in WotLK, but he is easily identifiable as the scourge mastermind behind developing the plague and creating the Lich King's more horrific abominations (which also helps establish festergut and rotface.) Lady Deathwhisper is established as the leader of the cult of the damned. Now, back to dragon soul... look at Stormbinder Hagara. What, exactly, does she do? What positions her as a more &quot;powerful&quot; shaman above the others? Why is she qualified to be a boss? Warmaster Blackhorn could have been nicely tied in if the forces he leads, the elite dragonriders, had been seen once prior to DS. Even without specific mention of his name, he would have had some &quot;authority&quot; as a raid boss, so to speak.</div></div><hr />

At least ICC was fun, and the achievements were fun, and raiding was fun, and you tried to get the achievement mount because it was cool, and wasn't out shined by some store mount, and it had 12 bosses, and heroic mode bosses actually features different mechanics, instead of a new healthpool, and there was enough bosses for there to be easy bosses and hard bosses, and the legendary took at least some time to get, and ulduar was still worth going back to. Hell, alts were still fun to make.</div></div><hr />

I'd agree, but the numbers say the &quot;Annual Pass&quot; only softened continued losses. And while it may only be anecdotal, I can say that only two people in my fairly large guild only bothered with it...and that was for Diablo 3. They haven't actually played WoW in months.<br />
<br />
If Boub's powers of deduction and Spock-like logic are correct, then &quot;Internal Alpha&quot; has been going on. If that is the case, then the expansion is on track to follow previous patterns of starting Beta a month or two after the Press Tour.</div></div><hr />

I think the same thing. Seems like every time a new Warcraft expansion is announced people think blizzard is going to turn it around it six months which they have never proven able to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly, Beta will take 4 months or so, as it has for all the expansions. Even if they annouced beta tomorrow, that would push them to July. Likely it'll be mid to late March for the F+F beta (plus release of info), with that for a month or so at least. So I reckon May/June for the full beta to start.<br />
<br />
Secondly. There is the issue of D3, scheduled for 'late Q2', ie May/June. Theres no way they'll release both products within say 6 weeks of each other, especially if they have known crossover between customers. <br />
<br />
I think Blizz are relying on people picking up D3 to cover the summer for subs, and then when that gets stale after 6 weeks or so, to hit them with the expansion in Sept time.</div></div><hr />

Well, they had a playable Mists of Pandaria demo at Blizzcon 2011 with the pandaren starting zone and the monk class playable, so they've had &quot;enough code written for the game to start&quot; for quite a while now. Not to mention videos of most of the new zones.<br />
<br />
I'm curious as to what you think the developers have all been working on for the last four months if you think there isn't &quot;anything there&quot; yet.<br />

In contrast, examine ICC- professor putricide may have had no previous mention in WotLK, but he is easily identifiable as the scourge mastermind behind developing the plague and creating the Lich King's more horrific abominations (which also helps establish festergut and rotface.)<br />
We don't know he was the scourge mastermind behind that stuff. If he is, it's never been said in the lore and he didn't appear in WC3, where the Scourge plague was created by the Burning Legion and abominations were built in generic Slaughterhouse buildings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lady Deathwhisper is established as the leader of the cult of the damned. Now, back to dragon soul... look at Stormbinder Hagara. What, exactly, does she do? What positions her as a more &quot;powerful&quot; shaman above the others? Why is she qualified to be a boss?<br />
Hagara was one of the first orc mages, training under the Forsaken. While learning how to summon and bind elementals, she came into contact with Al'Akir the Windlord and became one of his minions, joining the Twilight Cult as a Stormbinder.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warmaster Blackhorn could have been nicely tied in if the forces he leads, the elite dragonriders, had been seen once prior to DS. Even without specific mention of his name, he would have had some &quot;authority&quot; as a raid boss, so to speak.<br />
Warmaster Blackhorn is the leader of Deathwing's personal escort and master of the few dozen twilight drakes that have survived this war.<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest of the bosses all have lore, too.<br />
<br />
Morchok was the most powerful elemental still under Deathwing's control at the time of the assault.<br />
<br />
Zon'ozz and Yor'sahj are minions of the Old God N'zoth who have been sent to help support Deathwing's efforts. Zon'ozz also once led an army for N'zoth when the Old God warred with C'thun and Yog-Sarron.<br />
<br />
Ultraxion is the only twilight dragon to ever be praised by Deathwing, and has spent his life absorbing the essences of nether drakes. Ultraxion is probably the only truly &quot;cheap&quot; boss in the raid, as he's most likely a substitute for Chromatus which I suppose may have been too difficult for Blizzard to model and implement in time for the raid.</div></div><hr />

They need it to sell well, fast. <br />
<br />
They might release DIII in summer but definitaly not pandas.<br />
I'm curious as to what you think the developers have all been working on for the last four months if you think there isn't &quot;anything there&quot; yet.Showing few cinematics is entirely different than having functioning, alive zone.<br />
Either Blizz carry out speedy testing this time round, or they'll fail to deliver the 'yearly expansions' that were promised. :)Yea, except if MoP came out in a year then it'd be out for 3 months already... There is no way they'd do yearly expansions, people would just give them the big ol' finger if they wanted them to pay 50 bucks for almost nothing (in addition to sub) every year.</div></div><hr />

Hell, alts were still fun to make.<br />
It was fun, especially with how easy it was to play alts (in comparison, Cataclysm sucks) and had a bunch of bosses. That said, as fun as it was, nobody wants to do the same raid for a year.</div></div><hr />

More people = Faster gathering of data = Faster release (or so I hope...). Oh, and please don't compare Cata beta with MoP. Cata had the whole 1-60 redesign going on so it took more than usual. I'm guessing that the MoP Beta will last about 2-3 months.</div></div><hr />

Anyway for a lot of overly excited people in this topic, get a bit real please. Whatever is Blizzard doing right now isn't even a regular alpha testing, that will come some time in the future and take let's say up to 2 months, then we'll have beta test taking about 4-5 months and we are lookign at a fall release, there's no way Blizzard releases the game in summer. They need it to sell well, fast. <br />
<br />
They might release DIII in summer but definitaly not pandas.Showing few cinematics is entirely different than having functioning, alive zone.Yea, except if MoP came out in a year then it'd be out for 3 months already... There is no way they'd do yearly expansions, people would just give them the big ol' finger if they wanted them to pay 50 bucks for almost nothing (in addition to sub) every year.<br />
<br />
Get real? Beta testing for 4-5 months wont happen. will be 3 or 3 1/2 most likely and just because it might not be regular alpha testing does not mean it will be 2months before F&amp;F alpha or any announcement of beta. Cataclysm had revamped content for whole kalimdor and eastern kingdoms which is quite alot of work in addition to the 5 new zones.<br />
<br />
A release during the summer is questionable yes but in that case then a possible release in August or early June seems most logical, with more favor towards August release. They have stated they want new content out faster than before so it wont be a &quot;ICC-2&quot; for DS-</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly, Beta will take 4 months or so, as it has for all the expansions. Even if they annouced beta tomorrow, that would push them to July. Likely it'll be mid to late March for the F+F beta (plus release of info), with that for a month or so at least. So I reckon May/June for the full beta to start.<br />
<br />
Secondly. There is the issue of D3, scheduled for 'late Q2', ie May/June. Theres no way they'll release both products within say 6 weeks of each other, especially if they have known crossover between customers. <br />
<br />
I think Blizz are relying on people picking up D3 to cover the summer for subs, and then when that gets stale after 6 weeks or so, to hit them with the expansion in Sept time.<br />
<br />
Why do People allways forget that before the release of MoP not only D3 comes out but SC2: Addon 1 too? wich makes a summer/August release for MoP impossible...</div></div><hr />

From posts from SFA blues on the Customer Services forums Blizzard would much rather take away the benefits of the annual pass then turn away a potential customer.<br />
<br />
IE They would rather take the mount off you , take away the free D3 and take away your beta spot in the MoP beta.... Then look into collection agencies to recover the remaining payments in the 12 month contract.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that if you give Billing a call and you talk to them about your financial situation they'll be willing to take you off the Annual Pass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just stop or cancel your subscription. You automatically lose all bonuses tied to the annual pass, but I imagine that a lot of people will do this. Annual pass sounded like a great idea when people thought Diablo would be release Early Q1 with MoP to follow about 6 months later, but with how slow they're moving I expect another big drop in subs before any games release this year.<br />
<br />
I mean how can the second 1/3rd of a game take so damn long, they released Starcraft and the expansion for SC both within a year of each other and the expansion had as much content as the original game. Oh yeah that's right they had a full dev team working on one game. Now they try to juggle their development team between four games and never focus on one game. That explains why the Diablo III beta is still so broken after all this time and nowhere near release. I wish they never dissolved Blizzard North and lost most of the devs from that team. Diablo III would have been done 1-2 years ago, minimum.<br />
<br />
At their current pace we'll get Starcraft 2 the full game released completely after 8 years with the expansion taking another 4 years for finish for a total of 12 years. It only took then maybe 3-4 years to completely develop the original Starcraft from the ground up and this time they're only copy pasting the original with better graphics and a few new very minor additions. Diablo III was announced in 2008 so they were playing with ideas a minimum for 1-2 years prior which makes a 4 year + development cycle for the game alone with the expansion taking another 2 years at this rate for a total of 6 years...How is that acceptable by any means.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I liked SC2 I just liked it better the first time I played it as Starcraft. I hope that doesn't happen with Diablo III. From what I've seen it offers the same exact experience that Torchlight. I'm hoping Blizzard has something bigger then real life money on in game items.<br />
<br />
TLDR: I hope their skeleton development teams start gaining members so we can actually see Blizzard make some progress this year, especially with the complete and utter lack of attention and focus on WoW.</div></div><hr />

You can't cancel your subscription if you have opted into annual pass. You basically signed a contract when you signed up for it and it's not going to be broken easily. You have to contact Blizzard and give a reason that is on their list of criteria. I don't know any exact reasons off the top of my head.

Maybe we'll get open beta in may and then it'll get released in august. There is absolutely no set time-frame for the games development process. For all we know it could have been well underway behind our backs. But on the internet conspiracies like these are expected. :/ (It could be over half finished for all we know at this point.) And FYI you will get D3 and beta. Even if D3 doesnt come out til fall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paying my sub for more than six months with NO NEW CONTENT just wasn't, in my opinion, worth it. Especially when the content was progressively less and less. <br />
<br />
I wish only good times to those of you who remain subbed and are enjoying the game. The content patches just weren't worth more than $100 to me any more.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2012-02-21, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't get why people bought into the Annual Pass. Most of you were after the mount (which you got), some felt they were going to be playing WoW anyhow (which most of you are, and obviously don't remember what the end of an expansion looks like, it's pretty damned dull), and some were after the free D3, which all added up was a zero sum game for allowing them to nail your credit card once per month. <br />
<br />
As a person that's dealt with people who break contracts only to have them end up in collection, let this be a really good lesson for the future. If you are asked to sign up for something and commit to an annual or multi-year payment schedule for a consumer item or service, tell them NO EFFING WAY. <br />
<br />
I personally thought the name itself was misleading, as I always felt they should have requested full payment up front rather than the opportunity to pay over time since this was going to lead to a ton of bad feelings when they didn't make good on the Q1 delivery of D3 and they were going to starve the WoW playing public for content over the next year until they released MoP. Sure you get Beta Access. Get ready to be pissed off when you're bored out of your skull with that and they wipe your realms a few times. <br />
<br />
TL;DR: Caveat Emptor, never trust this or any gaming company when you think you know they will deliver on your schedule and not theirs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Queen of Hamsters</div><div class="date">2012-02-21, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">-_-'...It is really tiresome seeing adolescent know-it-alls going on about how they pity those that signed up for the annual pass, how we got &quot;suckered&quot; into it and how we should let this be a lesson...I have gone into contracts with breeders for dogs worth 2000 euro with breeding rights worth about 10k-15k euro per litter with average litter size accounted for, I've entered into contracts for insurance, house/apartment, cars and so on...Most adult people that signed for the annual pass, have entered contracts before without a problem at all, contracts concerning a lot more than game time. Do I really have anything to learn from someone too stupid/raged at this game/bad at economics to see that the annual pass was a good deal to some people when they try to give me a lecture? No...of course not. The very thought is just way too hilarious to fathom.Did some people sign the annual pass without giving it much thought? Sure, but they weren't suckered...they had the rules written in front of them and still signed without thinking. That's not Blizzard's fault. Just as it ain't their fault when some people grow bored/fail so hard at the game that they grow angry at it. <br />
<br />
What's next, Blizzard getting blamed for people in general living beyond their assets?I signed up for this pass after carefully reading it (yes, actually reading it! HURR!) and simply realizing that it would benefit me. I have not felt regret even once, and despite this being the end of yet another expansion I'm enjoying myself enough to stay subscribed, just like I did at the end of WOTLK. Simple.Thinking.And.Knowing.What.You.Want is all that goes into my decision to sign that annual pass. <br />
<br />
I'm sure the same can be said for most adults that signed, and those that are the exceptions...well, they should learn a thing or two, that's true. But again, it ain't Blizzard's fault in any way. Now, time to keep playing and shuffling and leveling and raiding and doing all the fun stuff that's fun in the game still. :).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2012-02-21, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never said it was Blizz's fault Rorcanna, you made my point exactly. You're obviously someone happy with the contract, and happy with the purchase, and not part of the 14-21 year olds that are so dumb they can't read terms and requirements. Read the text of what you sign, and think ahead. I deal in contracts on a daily basis and the dumbest thing I've ever heard was &quot;I didn't read it before signing&quot; and even dumber are the people that didn't comprehend it. The point is, I like reading stories where people didn't read, because I hope that it teaches them for life down the road. If you live in the USA, we honor contracts here, so don't expect anyone to let you out of them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ImpTaimer</div><div class="date">2012-02-21, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why are people still pissing and moaning over the annual pass. It's a straight gain to go for it unless you don't want to play WoW. If you don't want to play WoW, don't sign up for it.<br />
<br />
For assumption purposes: $60 (Diablo 3) + 25$ (Tyrael's Charger) = $85. That's OVER a 6-month subscription ($77.94 USD - Six Months Recurring ($12.99 per month)). They even throw in a free beta access. Assuming the length of the beta, lets assume a few months, that's practically getting another free game in itself (another $30-60). Even if you don't care about the mount, you still profit from doing the annual pass just from two free games (most single-player games run their course in at least a month unless you play them sparingly or it has mod/multiplayer support).<br />
<br />
Lets be honest, you're only pissed off because you haven't been told exactly when Diablo 3 or MoP beta access will come out, so you feel like you're wasting money sticking to a game you're bored with. You'd rather play Rift, SWTOR, or etc till these things come out, but you're stuck with this annual pass. If that's the case, you never should've signed up. <br />
<br />
Developers these days are really keen on the &quot;it'll be done when it's done&quot; gimmick when in reality they're just creating superfluous hype for their game. They know when they want to push it out, otherwise you wouldn't have to worry as much about them releasing half-empty, buggy, boring games. &quot;When it's done&quot; is just the new gimmick game companies adopted to sell games. Get used to getting set up for failure. Pre-orders, DLC, and mod-kits pretty much pampered developers into releasing crapware. When people stop pre-ordering and buying DLC, we'll see some better customer care.<br />
<br />
I mean really people, if you can't handle a little math or commitment, don't even bother with marriage.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
But don't get me wrong... I blame Ghostcrawler for most of the fun that got sucked out of the game. He's in charge of classes, the key-fun-factor in the game, and he failed miserably. Waiting whole Xpacs to even attempt anything drastic with a class is just pathetic, especially for a game you pay a subscription for. PTR is just a fucking joke.</div></div><hr />

Well we might actually see a raid tier that lasts longer then Icecrown after-all! Look at the bright side D3 might be available by then? That or Heart of the Swarm? No.. no.. who am I kidding those are wishful dreams. Blizzcon 2012 will come before all of those (zing).</div></div><hr />

Too late, simple as. You walked into blizzards hands as do so many on a monthly basis, look look.. here's some shiny things and such now throw your money at us. By the time you realize its the same ould junk and boring crap its too late.. they haz all your monies. They no longer make games for gamers but for the masses! And to the guy going on about his financial situation, tbh why would you put money into a game if your finical situation could decline so swiftly where you couldn't afford to play a game :( I mean did you do just like the above and see 'oh shiny things' and auto sign up without even thinking about it.</div></div><hr />

Your wrong - there will be no Blizzcon this year - they just dont have the time for that while they have to release 3 games :D</div></div><hr />

Even if they don't wanna say anything cause of NDA, lying and saying it's a month or two away wasnt needed.</div></div><hr />
