Starcraft 2 Commemorative Bundle<br />
In appreciation for John &quot;Totalbiscuit&quot; Bain and his family's contributions to Starcraft 2, Blizzard is releasing a commemorative bundle (https://starcraft2.com/en-us/news/22481041) of cosmetics for the game. 100% of the profits will go to the Bain family as well as from any future sales of John's Announcer Pack. The bundle will be available this week and is a limited time item, becoming unavailable once it sells out or by December 31, 2018.<br />

<br />
Besides making an artificial scarcity, there's probably a few reasons for limiting a number of digital bundles. Odds are in this case they have a set amount that they would want to donate because their financial people have figured out that if they were to donate a bit more then it would cause tax issues for either them, Genna, or both that would potentially lead into owing more money next year than they would like. Or if they live in England, there's possibly laws and limits about transferring money.<br />
<br />
Also I like how the coin seems to be the one Reinhardt had. I do kinda want that.<br />
<br />
<br />

It's the Diablo they use in the Darkening of Tristram event in D3 - he has the horn instead of soulstone and the figure in the box has a tail (the D1 Diablo featured the horn but no tail but they added a tail to the model in the DoT event).</div></div><hr />

There are people out there who helped others a lot more and died in cancer and nobody cares about them. <br />
<br />
Btw This is disgusting because Blizzard will use this income as charity in their book so they can write it down in their tax returns. Avoiding taxes via dead people. It is a new low.</div></div><hr />

wow, you are a sad person. So what if it counts as a charity. So you are saying companies should never do charitys for anything? Give charity to the people of a hurricane? how dare they avoid taxes by natural diasters. victims in a shooting? how dare they avoid taxes by people getting shot.<br />
<br />
i think it is great blizzard are is doing it. This is not avoid taxes via dead, this is support the Widow of a man who did a lot for starcraft, which he did, and his wife is in pretty massiv debt, because america and health care</div></div><hr />

I don't think you know how income tax returns work, the guy is technically correct. Not saying he is correct about Blizzard's motives of course.</div></div><hr />

And did those people also have a massive influence on the communities, eSports development, and popularity of one of Blizzard's games? No? Oh, then I guess you understand why this is relevant.<br />
<br />
Also, who gives a shit if they're avoiding taxes? They're helping out someone who has fucking cancer. Yes, Genna Bain, single mother with a special needs child who just lost her husband, has cancer. Maybe look up the situation before calling Blizzard out on shit that isn't an issue.<br />

The difference here is that Blizzard is not actually giving to charity in this case, but are still reaping the benefits of giving to charity. It is a very common tactic and is basically just a way for huge companies to increase their write offs without actually giving the money themselves. That's why you always see drug stores and grocery stores and whatever trying to sell you little one dollar donations to whatever charity. It's not because they're trying to do a good thing.<br />
<br />
Just to make up some numbers, pretend Blizzard sells enough of these bundles to make $1,000,000 to give to the charity that has been set up for TotalBiscuit's wife(and there will be a legal charity set up... its not like they're just going to mail her a personal check). They donate the money to the charity, and then get to write off $1,000,000 on their taxes as a charitable donation without actually spending the $1,000,000.<br />
<br />
If they wanted to help out his family they would just do it. These types of things are set up specifically so that the company can look like its giving to charity and receive the benefits without actually spending their own money. There's a big difference between a company donating money to a disaster relief charity and a company saying, &quot;Come buy this thing and we'll donate the proceeds to charity!&quot; The first one is the company trying to help out, the second one is the company trying to look like they're helping out while increasing their tax write offs.<br />
<br />
It's not a BAD thing. The money still gets to where they need it. But don't pretend when a company(not just Blizzard. It's a game as old as the idea of taxes and happens everywhere in the world) does something like this they're being altruistic instead of just trying to make their bottom line look better at the end of the year while gaining some good publicity.</div></div><hr />

No and i agree. That companies are dicks, If they got NO benefits from it, they would not give a Penny to TB's wife.<br />
yes they do it so they can write it off as chairty. but. that is the way of the fucking world. They could alos choice NOT to do it, and pay taxes on it, and then no money would go to charity.. That is why there is that &quot;loop hole&quot;. i said many times, the essence of a company, would throw a man of a Skyscraper and killing the man if the Profit from Why ever they did it, Outweghts the negativity and lost of money that it would do.<br />
<br />
but fact is. Blizzard could not have done this, i am happy they did, do they get something out of it? yes.<br />
i am not claiming blizzards are saints. but in a choise between donating or not donating to Genna Baine, I am happy they are doing it.</div></div><hr />
