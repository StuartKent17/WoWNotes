2/10 Alpha Build Design Notes<br />
Hey all,<br />
Yet another new Alpha build is on its way, hopefully today. More new and revised things are available to test:<br />
<br />
<br />
New Specializations Unlocked – A whopping 6 new specializations are ready for testing! We’d love any and all feedback about their gameplay, artifact quest lines, abilities, etc.<br />
<br />
Holy Priest Holy Paladin Protection Paladin Beast Mastery Hunter Demonology Warlock Arcane Mage<br />
<br />
Class Status – We’re continuing to iterate on our class abilities and talents, based on testing and feedback. This build has many revisions scattered around the classes, but here are some highlights:<br />
<br />
Retribution Paladins – Several talents have been revised.<br />
Enhancement Shamans – Many talents have been revised. We also revised some of their baseline abilities, and passives.<br />
Elemental Shamans – Many talents have been revised. We also revised some of their baseline abilities, and passives.<br />
Guardian Druids – Their core offensive combat abilities have received significant changes. Hopefully this should create more engaging gameplay.<br />
Blood Death Knights – Many talents have been revised. We also revised some of their baseline abilities.<br />
Subtlety Rogues – We’ve significantly revised their core combat abilities. We’ve also tweaked what abilities each spec has.<br />
Marksmanship Hunters – Several talents have been revised.<br />
Survival Hunters – Several talents have been revised.<br />
Discipline Priest – We revised some baseline abilities. <br />
<br />
Creature Tuning – We continue to tweak the health levels of creatures in Legion. In this build, creature health has been raised, because combat times were generally too short. Feedback on whether creatures take too long or too little time to kill is valuable, as well as how sparsely or densely populated with creatures the world is. Be sure to mention specific locations when giving feedback on this!<br />
<br />
Thanks, and we look forward to your feedback!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2016-02-11, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">... Wait, so Blizzard's giving back single target rez for non-healers but giving healers a mass rez? So Blizzard does listen. Only took numerous complaints to get that to change. :rolleyes: They never should have changed it to begin with. It was never broken. What dumb ass DPS/tank complained that rezzing was too hard?<br />
<br />
Still doesn't make me view Legion in a positive light. The fact that we have to fight tooth and nail for things like a baseline rez is plain stupid. We shouldn't be fighting with Blizzard over anything, and yet that seems to be what's happening. We should be excited over a new expansion, not wondering what will be taken from us next and wondering why our version of &quot;fun&quot; is being destroyed for Blizzard's version of &quot;fun&quot;. I'm still not happy with Blizzard taking my earth shield and grounding totem from me as a PVE resto shaman. Given what I've seen with shamans alone, I'm not too sure I want to even look much at other classes for fear of hating Legion that much more.</div></div><hr />

Fully agree, although a lot of 13/13M raiders who also got it before 2/2 was released also didn't get in :(<br />

It's because they botted in the past. Only clean accounts got it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Been like that for the last 10 years. Did you really expect that would change now?? Usually it needs patch x.1 to get them halfway fixed..and by patch x.2 the melees and druids scale so well with increasing GS that shadows are crap again. Every single addon the same.</div></div><hr />

The addition of gnome hunters already meant gnome hunters galore. That just compliments it.</div></div><hr />

Well if there was going to be a list of new legendaries, they might as well have thrown it in.<br />
<br />
Looks more like they just removed the chance on hit effect from the old one. Makes about as much sense as adding a new version and keeping it at the same ilvl as the original.</div></div><hr />

They still have night elf eyebrows! they still have hair growin at the back of their ear and they still have ugly mismatched colours as if something puked on them! Not to mention that they don't match with bear form combos, which are nice looking. <br />
<br />
I made an quick edit how it would look like if the forms were TINY BIT adjusted to match the bear form :<br />

Blizzard, along with Konami, dropped their business with Upper Deck after it was discovered that they were printing and selling counterfeit YuGiOh cards.</div></div><hr />

They aren't nearly as impressive as some of the other artifacts, and I think a resize would do them a lot of good. If you look at the bows currently in game, the cooler ones are big. The bow in alpha looks tiny as fuck when sheathed.<br />
<br />
(I'm not talking about &quot;Golden Bow of Quel'thalas&quot; big, but a little resize would mean a more aggresive and badass looking weapon)<br />
<br />
I was hesitant about the new bow model, but now I think I kinda like it, I just hope there are better color variations in store for it</div></div><hr />
