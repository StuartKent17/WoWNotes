Love is in the Air (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/423-love-is-in-the-air) once again, at least until February 24! It appears that nothing has changed this year, but you can still run the Crown Chemical Co. encounter every day for a chance at the Big Love Rocket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/50250-big-love-rocket) though! <br />

Warlords of Draenor - Casting While Moving<br />
Casting on the move is something we've talked about a lot, and we're definitely making some changes along those lines. I don't have any details I can share at this point, but I can at least give some insight into our thinking.<br />
<br />
We like casting on the move, but not as a default. Spiritwalker's Grace is a good example of something we like; used intelligently, it can be very strong, and it feels good to use. On the other hand, Lightning Bolt always being castable on the move we're less excited about. You don't feel smart or skilled for using Lightning Bolt while you're moving, it's just sort of a free bonus that we're not sure is really needed.<br />
<br />
Things like Kil'Jaeden's Cunning fall somewhere in the middle. The effect is similar to Lightning Bolt in that it's always active and you don't really have to think about it. However, you are effectively giving up either Archimonde's Darkness or Mannoroth's Fury in order to take it. Whether or not that's enough of a tradeoff is something we're discussing, but we have seen a lot more Warlocks giving up KJC for something else since Patch 5.4.<br />
<br />
It's also important to note that the ability to use a cast-time spell while moving is only part of the issue. In fact, while there's only a couple of classes that can do that, almost everyone has some number of instant cast spells they can use while moving. To really start shoring up the differences here, we need to reduce the number of instant cast spells as well. That includes healers.<br />
<br />
We're still iterating rapidly on all of this, so anything can change at any point, but that's what we're currently thinking.<br />
<br />
Million dollar question here. Hunters are arguably one of, if not the most, mobile ranged classes in the game. We can maintain our full rotation while moving. Are we considered a caster for the purposes of this discussion? Being able to do 100% rotation on the move is one of the few reasons I decided to roll hunter.<br />
We like mobility as the Hunter's &quot;niche&quot;. I won't guarantee you'll still be able to do 100% of your rotation on the move, but we want to try to keep what we can there. It's something we're likely to do a lot of iteration on.<br />
<br />
doesnt really change the fact that they said talents will be the same and wont be getting an overhaul like previous xpac.<br />
We're not going to overhaul the entire talent system again, correct. That doesn't mean we aren't going to change any talents.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Don't you think talents should be spec specific? Fine keep this 3 talents in a row stuff but have separate trees for separate specs<br />
It wasn't in the original implementation but we do have the ability to customize talents per spec now. You'll see a bit of it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/427284579347492864))<br />
<br />
Planning to scale back incoming tank damage when we lose the cloak proc? Or should we just deal with it?!<br />
Incoming tank damage while leveling is always really mild for well-geared characters. At 100, content tuned to available gear. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427007978613383168))<br />

i noticed that demo locks with green fire turn into a green demon but when they are getting demonic fury they are purple, fix?<br />
I believe we didn't notice that until the last minute, and getting that art greenified didn't make it in time. Fixed in 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427022122515300353))<br />
hey that's really great to hear, is there any other warlock aren't getting updated for green fire?<br />
I think there was one other super minor thing... Like a glow trail you leave behind you when Demonic Leap, or something. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427032537383202816))<br />

Are there any plans to make Fury warriors less complicated?<br />
Rotationally, not significantly. We'll be taking steps to reduce button bloat, just like with everyone else. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427024402861924352))<br />

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/us-en.png US Connected Realms - Update 2/7<br />

<br />
<br />
http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Connected Realms Update - 10/02<br />
The following realms are scheduled to be connected this week:<br />
<br />
English Realms<br />
<br />
(PvP) Bloodfeather and Kor'gall/Executus/Burning Steppes<br />
(PvP) Spinebreaker and Dragonmaw/Haomarush<br />
(PvP) Dunemaul and Auchindoun/Jaedenar<br />
<br />
<br />
French Realms<br />
<br />
(RP PvP) La Croisade écarlate and Culte de la Rive noire<br />
<br />
<br />
German Realms<br />
<br />
(RP PvP) Die Todeskrallen and Die Arguswacht/Das Syndikat<br />
<br />
<br />
The following realms are currently scheduled to be connected during the week beginning 24/02:<br />
<br />
English Realms<br />
<br />
(PvP) Xavius and Skullcrusher<br />
(PvP) Vashj and Dragonmaw/Haomarush/Spinebreaker<br />
(PvP) Laughing Skull and Shattered Halls/Balnazzar/Ahn'Qiraj/Trollbane/Talnivarr/Chromaggus/Boulderfist/Daggerspine<br />
<br />
<br />
French Realms<br />
<br />
(PvE) Suramar and Medivh<br />
(RP PvP) Conseil des Ombres and La Croisade écarlate/Culte de la Rive noire<br />
<br />
<br />
Spanish<br />
<br />
(RP) Los Errantes and (PvE) Colinas Pardas/Tyrande<br />
<br />
<br />
Any chance of English PVE realms getting some connecting love from you guys as to this date only 2 of these connections have been made versus 15 PVP connections.<br />
<br />
Top of my head I would say Bronze Dragonflight &amp; Hellfire are in dire need for a love connection to be made sooner rather then later.<br />
We've nothing against PvE realms at all, there just happened to be more low pop PvP realms, which is why the list is a little PvP heavy right now. We're trying to help some of the smallest realms first, then work our way up to the bigger ones where possible.<br />
<br />
Even if this is an exception, it does bring about the question how it will be handled that rp(pvp) have additional policies that are likely to conflict with policies in place on pve/pvp realms.<br />
This is indeed an exceptional case for Spanish realms, due to the fact there was only one RP and one RP PvP realm. We asked the players on these realms what they would prefer, and this was the option they went for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well we know what's causing it. The gateways and portals disappear once you get out of range. Especially in the case of the Gateway it's very annoying as the furthest point is usually already ~40 foot away so moving away from it just a bit will cause it to poof.<br />
<br />
But yeah, we need a fix for this. Even if not for SoO then at least an acknowledgement that it woń be a problem in WoD any more</div></div><hr />

Besides ele shamans have no instant spells to use as filler while moving except the shock spells which are on 5 sec cooldown while almost every other class does even if they dont warlocks/mages make up for the loss of casts by hitting like trucks when they stop on one spot :\</div></div><hr />

You better not screw casters blizz just because some casters (mage) have lots of instants. Fix melee first then play with casters not the other way around.</div></div><hr />

It's today (so they said) but it's still early (6am Blizzard HQ time right now). I would think it will come out anytime between before noon.</div></div><hr />

If people unsubscribe or subscribe because of something like a holiday event not giving 500+ ilvl... I'm glad those players aren't playing anymore.</div></div><hr />

For me, Holiday events weren't the straw that broke the horse's back, but it definitely was one of the contributing factors to that poor horse. Sure, they put most of their resources into raids. But raids become stale after a month. Where's the incentive to log in? How many more years do we have to look at that same stupid tent at DMF under construction??? &quot;We know you guys want more content, so here's another Blizzard store pet!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole 5man Dungeon thing in MoP or WoW overall is screwed up. By the time the final Raid patch comes out, those 5man dungeons are dropping crappy gear, and very outdated. Those dungeons were designed around 5.1 gear, but with patch 5.4 and gear drops of i572, the i450's in 5man dungeons are stupid. <br />
<br />
Why doesn't Blizzard upgrade gear stats on dungeon drops with each new major patch release ? When Patch 5.4 released, all the dungeon drops should have been bumped up from the original i450 level, to like i516 / i522, and also make the bosses tougher and harder overall.</div></div><hr />

Play melee much? Some of us melee would like to actually hit our targets in pvp. Casters aren't casters if they don't have to actually cast anything.<br />
Don't forget the nerf to interrupts and cast speed debuffs, so this is a good time to nerf instant casts.</div></div><hr />

Really, let's make elemental shamans the most boring static game charakter ever build in the entire mmo history! .... Crap times ahead i guess...<br />

I think the KJC style &quot;cast your low rotation on the move but your big damage spells/resource users require standing still&quot; makes the most sense. SWG is so fucking awkward I almost never use it on my Shaman. You don't want to use it because hey, you might need it more a few seconds later and it has a serious CD. Really clumsy solution.<br />
<br />
When I played a Warlock with KJC it was like having the chains lifted off my shoulders.</div></div><hr />

Way to take the most shallow interpretation. If you are still logging on to repeat the same dailies, do outdated holidays with ilvl drops below trash in the Isle and try to raid, I feel sorry for your RL social life. <br />
<br />
I played through a Garrosh kill, then realized I had absolutely nothing to look forward to for the next 6-8 months at least. I have already spent countless hours trying to farm old content gear/mounts/pets. Those I do not have I have given up on as a waste of my time. Why gear my alts in Raids if their gear will be replaced, why do the same dailies again and again and why pay $15 a month to literally fly in circles in the vale while I wait/hope for enough ppl to be on to raid (cause pugging a raid hurts soooo bad).<br />
<br />
My statement generalizes the way in which Blizzard treats its customers. We are paying $15 a month for current content, not for the Xpac. The Xpac will cost you $49.95+, that is what should be paying for it. My $15 should be used to continue to provide content for the current expansion along with the customer service etc. When Blizz starts focusing on the next xpac, my $15 a month is stolen from current gameplay to float the next Xpac, thus I am being forced to pay for content I may not even purchase.<br />
<br />
So I choose to cancel my subscription. I may or may not come back with the next xpac. Additionally, I will probably be offered nice incentives to come back, like free gameplay, mounts, pets etc. While you devoted players who payed $15 a month for no new content, will get nothing. (I am jaded cause in the past I played constantly and got pissed when the players who stuck around got nothing)</div></div><hr />

Perfect post, and sums up WoW. LFR SoO is like going to the dentist, so painful. Flex of Regular with a good Guild is a lot more fun, but never easy getting the schedule down for everyone, so finding that good 10man Regular group for SoO can take a while.<br />
<br />
We pay $15 / month for content, but where is that $15 per month going at the long drought of NOTHINGNESS between final patch and new expansion ? End of Cat to beginning of MoP was 10 months of NOTHING new, almost a full year with the same old stuff, and we are paying $15 for what during that time ?. And now patch 5.4 released in September, with nothing new until this Summer / Fall with WoD, will be another year or so with nothing new.<br />
<br />
And then they ask $49 for a new expansion ? WTF. I think my $150 I spent over those 10 months of nothing new should be covering the cost of the expansion.<br />
<br />
Right now MoP is at that dead time. The last Raid patch was released 5 months ago, and SoO is getting stale and boring. I run my weekly old Raids for Transmog and mounts on Tuesdays / Wednesdays, but even that is getting old after so many weeks doing the same thing with no drops.</div></div><hr />
