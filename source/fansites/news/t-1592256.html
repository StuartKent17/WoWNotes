<br />
Release the Names! Character Name Reclamation Coming<br />
With the upcoming Warlords of Draenor pre-patch (6.0.2), we will be releasing sidelined characters’ names back into the wild. <br />
<br />
Any characters that have not logged into the game since November 13, 2008 will have their names freed up, making them available to anyone creating a new character or using the paid Character Name Change service.<br />
<br />
How Do I Preserve My Names?<br />
You will need to log in to World of Warcraft and enter the game using each character whose name you wish to retain before patch 6.0.2 goes live. While it is possible no one will claim your recently released name and you might be able to snag it again, it is probably not worth the risk if you want to keep your names intact long-term.<br />
<br />
Our goal with this great name liberation is to make sure new and returning players have a large and varied pool of names available to choose from—so log in now if you wish preserve your unused characters’ names for your journey intro Draenor.</div></div><hr />

How the hell is it low, if a person doesn't play the game for 6 years, why should their name be saved?<br />

The bottom line is, if you haven't logged on since 2008 which is the release of Wotlk, then you OBVIOUSLY don't play the game, and don't want to.</div></div><hr />

i don't get why people want their name reserved if they haven't played in 2 or 3 years anyway, i'm pretty sure you can just make a new name since nobody will remember you anyway.</div></div><hr />

If you haven't subbed the game for 6 years in a row, you don't give a shit about the game anymore and couldn't care less if someone is now using a name you haven't used in 6 years.</div></div><hr />

So you've been sitting on a name for SIX GOD DAMN YEARS without using it or touching the character at all, is what you're saying?<br />

Well, if you intend to come back for Warlords, maybe you should reup your subscription and start playing these ancient, dusty, decrepit characters, before they rightfully lose their names.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. At this point its just being greedy. I'd show no sympathy for a 6 year old untouched character to lose their name simply because someone was unsubscribed and can't log into it. If they haven't used a character 6 years they had no serious intentions of using the name anyways, good riddance.</div></div><hr />

Eh, I'm okay with them releasing names that haven't been used in half a decade. But that said, this is exactly the kind of thing where I expect slow creep.

They will just block its name, not delete the char mate.<br />
<br />
Still seeing current situation of subs I can't help but think of it as: &quot;If you want to keep your name please buy a subscription&quot; :D If it didn't happen before on few occasions I'd be sure they just want more subs:P</div></div><hr />

No one is losing their character. They are losing the ability to retain a specific sequence of characters associated with that name that they literally have not used in over 5 years. This is definitely not the end of the world.</div></div><hr />

It really is true that no matter what Blizzard do there will always be at least 1 idiot there to complain about it.<br />
<br />
If you haven't logged into the game for 6 years, You have lost all right to complain about losing character names or what Blizzard does.</div></div><hr />

You really think somebody who has been away for over 6 years cares about the name they once used in a game, or even read the news for a game they haven't played in 6 years?<br />
<br />
I know I don't give a shit if somebody takes a name I once used in a game I haven't played in 6 years, I don't even remember what I called myself in games I havent played in over a year.<br />

This. If they didn't do this, they would eventually reach a point where all new players would have to enter random text in the name box until they found SOMETHING that wasn't taken.<br />

But that said, this is exactly the kind of thing where I expect slow creep. Give it a year or two (or more, Blizzard is diabolically good at slowly boiling frogs) and it'll be &quot;resub for a month every year or lose your names&quot;.<br />
<br />
1. what are you basing that on?<br />
2. That would not be very good for business. Surely you can understand that? That would turn off people who subscribe for expansions and then fade out till the next pack. <br />
<br />
They've lost 5 million subscribers in the last 3 years or so. That's a lot of names being taken up by people who just aren't coming back. If you havent logged into a character in 6 years, what is the point of hanging onto that name? That's a very long time. If you are a subscriber, it takes 2 seconds to fix by logging in as it now. If you arent one right now, then what does it matter that you're going to have to pick a new name for a character YOU HAVEN'T LOGGED INTO IN SIX YEARS?</div></div><hr />

If you want to keep the names of your characters that you haven't played in 6+ years, then go sub and log in. <br />

Your character will just be flagged for a name change, not deleted.<br />

You're already able to ticket a GM to clear up character names that haven't been active in years, they're just doing a mass wave of it themselves.</div></div><hr />

Those that resub just for this are probably in denial about not wanting to play any way(i've seen this first hand). And so should just either enjoy the game or make a final decision to get over it and let the name go.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure if you haven't logged in over the course of almost 6 years the potential of losing a character name isn't going to be an impetus to get you to re-subscribe to a game you obviously don't care about.<br />

<br />
Maybe I'm reading the blue post wrong, but it seems even those level 1s will be freed up if they were reserved before 2008 and never played since. You actually have to log in to each character to save them.<br />
<br />
If they were created after 2008, then yeah, too bad. Still, this frees up a ton of names from even active players.</div></div><hr />

No see, the people saying that are the people who quit for some reason (probably mostly the ones who threw a temper tantrum and said &quot;THIS IS IT, I QUIT!&quot;) and still WANT to play.. but can't. So they have to make it all sour grapes.</div></div><hr />

Typical Blizzard conspiracy rants in this thread... for shame guys, this is a long time coming. If someone hasn't played since '08 then what is the point of even having names anymore? That's like 6+ years of inactivity.<br />

It's just that all the people who made characters in vanilla and BC, when WoW was shiny and new, who then lost interest and never came back, whose characters will sit on the server taking up perfectly good names forever... that is a problem in a game with a limited number of names.

Agree'd but we were always able to get these inactive names by sending in a ticket request, this is just doing it on a massive scale so everything is up for grabs. Literally every name I am using right now has been request from a GM for inactivity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please explain to me your logic here? Honestly curious. You mean to make me believe that Blizz thinks that freeing up a name that hasn't been used in 6 years is going to make somebody (who again, hasn't played in 6 years) want to resub?<br />
<br />
And better yet, you think that Blizzard believes that these said players are going to check the WoW site (again, a site for game they haven't played in 6 years) daily just on the off-chance that something is said about their old vanilla/tbc toons?<br />
<br />
<br />

Yes there is a way. You log in and create Bob and see if it's available. Names get taken per server and names should be unique, so I'm not sure why do you want to check all Bobs on all servers.<br />
If Bob is yours, just log onto him to make sure the name is locked.<br />

I'm pretty sure I have at least two characters I haven't logged into in about 6 years and my account has been active for the entire time.<br />
<br />
Will I log into these characters I created to check out a different server at some point in the past? Probably.<br />
<br />
If I don't, will I be horribly upset about losing the names? Definitely not.<br />
<br />
It's people in this situation who are being informed by Blizzard that a name release is coming soon; people who have not had an active subscription for some time (up to or over 6 years) likely will not see this and will not care.</div></div><hr />

You didn't quite get it.<br />

For instance, one fact: ALL servers have a &quot;Bob&quot; character. But what you DO NOT know, is whether he's inactive since 2008 or not.<br />

Trolls gonna troll. They just like to piss people off. If you don't ignore them, you're just feeding them.<br />

I think this is definitely needed in a game as old as wow. Though it should sooner then 2008. If you haven't subbed in 1 or 2 xpacs, I doubt you'll be coming back any time soon.</div></div><hr />

If this was some kind of coax then they would've put the cutoff date around 2010. . .when the game peaked with subs, or maybe put the cutoff date at the release of Cata or MoP. . .<br />
<br />
If you haven't been on a character for 6 or more years (even if it's on an active account) you don't deserve to keep the name. Better released to someone who's gonna actually use it. Players who haven't had an active account for 6 or more years won't know or care -.-</div></div><hr />

No desperation at all, if someone hasn't been here since Vanilla/BC they obviously don't care. That being said not many people keep up to date on this kind of thing so they likely will never know. Only a small few stay up to date on a game they don't play anymore, and usually they just like sitting in the forums to whine about how &quot;bad&quot; the game is ... in their own opinion.</div></div><hr />

I made a bunch of characters on different servers to reserve names for me so I had a backup option if w/e server I was playing on went to shit, which happened 4 or 5 times during the time that I was playing, so having those backup characters ready and waiting made it easier for me to reinvest the time to level up new characters again as well as continue to stay subscribed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After asking our customer service people what took up a large amount of their time, and what we could do to alleviate that, one of them was: &quot;Getting the name of someone who hasn't logged in forever&quot;. After doing a bit more digging, we found that this was usually done with names that were before 2008, aka at the peak of Wow subs. People picked cool names when a new server came up, and soon afterwards, there were less cool names. This is an easy way to not upset people who are on a vacation or whatnot, while reducing the amount of stuff that CS has too do.<br />

More of a personal choice of the developers wanting players to have unique names without tags as well as a pre-battle.net 2.0 system. Seems most of the issues with the battle.net system including offline mode stems from WoW. The developers was also thought it was tacky to have realm mergers with player names with their original realm and the developers ended up doing what they should have from the start. So much things get held off in search of a better solution and the developers turn around and do just. Understandable when things tend to stick after implementation, but it hasnt stopped the developers from shoving in other systems and messing with and even remove them due to out of date due to game changes or bad design. Understandable, but then Blizzard has messed with things post launch and even gone the way of sidelining or even removing a system.</div></div><hr />

I originally created this character in vanilla when I found out that my friends had already started on a different server, and I wanted to catch up to them in level. Well, needless so say they quit playing around level 50, so I quit leveling my toon around level 30. I know that this toon is not yet in the blizzard armory, as I haven't logged into him since it became active.<br />

I'm not going to... no reason too. If the name gets taken (which I doubt), I'll just pick another... if I ever decide to play him again.</div></div><hr />

Still seeing current situation of subs I can't help but think of it as: &quot;If you want to keep your name please buy a subscription&quot; :D If it didn't happen before on few occasions I'd be sure they just want more subs:P<br />
<br />
I see it more as, &quot;The number of petitions to free up names is getting crazy and wasting our GM's time. How about we just free up everything that hasn't been used in 6 years and we don't have to deal with the requests anymore.&quot; This is sensible, and I agree it should have been 4 years, not 6.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently if a name hasn't been used in 6 years you can petition a GM to free it. Because this takes time most people only do it when they actually want to use the name.<br />
<br />
With the mass freeing of names there's going to be a 'gold rush' as people create loads of level 1s to reserve the best of the newly freed names. After this happens you won't be able to petition a GM for the name because it's been assigned a to a new character too recently.</div></div><hr />

What? It's not being used as a method to bring in subscriptions but rather towards new players or players who already have active subscriptions. Why would someone who has their subscription canceled care about spending $15 on the off chance that xxsephirothxx is freed up if they had no interest in playing the game anymore?<br />

This is simply what it is, freeing up names of ancient characters that haven't been played in six years for those who play the game now.</div></div><hr />

I have many alts at 90 with less than 6 days played that I don't log into often in an expansion but level each expansion. Seems it would be silly to get their name changed every 90 days if I have a small post expansion break.</div></div><hr />

Meh. The one time I petitioned for a name to be freed up, a name I hadn't see the owning player since they were level 35ish in Vanilla, it cost me nothing because it was for a new character.

Then those people are clueless. You can claim the name of your deceased friend and family TODAY. If they have the login data they can log in today, claim 10 free days and be done with it for another 6 years.

What? My relative xyz died and so his name should be reserved forever? And who says they are not making this up?

A lot of players already have a lot of characters leveled. I would say most want these new names on their main characters not level 1 alts. Which means paid name changes. A lot of them. This will generate a LOT of revenue and at the same time cut customer service costs since they won't have to respond to the name tickets.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you CAN do this, but it takes more effort on the individual's part. They have to open a ticket, possibly create additional tickets, and in the end, their request MAY be rejected.<br />
<br />
With the releasing of the names, however, blizzard is releasing a large number of names en-masse (There are currently only close to 7 mil active accounts. Throughout all of WoW's history, however, there have been over 100 million accounts. Thats a lot of potential freed names!).<br />
<br />
Now, lets say that 500k accounts decide to grab one of the free names (less then 10% of current playerbase, a reasonable number). Out of those, 50k (10% of the amount) decide to pay for a name change. That right there is a whopping 7.5 mil dollars generated!<br />
<br />
And, of course, there are those with more money then sense who will pay for multiple name changes.<br />

Not buying your story since I've been told 4 times now (trying to get names already taken via GM) that players who've been inactive for less than quite some years can't be freed up. Now, I don't know exactly how long it has to be inactive but I know it's 3+ years because a GM tried looked to free up my EX girlfriends char name but said it was not inactive long enough which was a little over 3 years =)<br />

Wait.. WAIT... Hold on.. THAT is a good point!<br />
<br />
Announcement! I am now retiring from WoW for 6 years so in 2020 I can have a FREE $10 name change! Man, this plan is GENIOUS! <br />
<br />
You're WRONG, sir, absolutely WRONG! That is an EXCELLENT suggestion and a VERY good point of the post you quoted! I mean, I'll save 6x12 monthly subscription money AND get a free name change! Just 'cause I won't get to play one of my favorite video games or hang out online with my friends in a world I've come to love and hold dear is just tough. A sacrifice well worth making :rolleyes:<br />

<br />
Considering that the primary focus of this website is news coverage and discussion on Blizzard games why are you even here if you hate them so much?<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt anyone that quit 6 years ago is going to return just to preserve their toon's name. Anyone that has been gone that long is most likely not coming back for very valid reasons.<br />
<br />
-Stable career that pays well takes up a great deal of time.<br />
-Is now married with children to raise.<br />
-Has moved on to other games with no interest in returning to WoW.<br />
<br />
Many veteran players that do happen to return after an extended absence, often just get a new account. It's far easier to level up and learn how to play a new toon in game than to take an old one and have to relearn to play it again.<br />
<br />

I'm really happy you got the names you wanted, and share in your joy!

I mean, unless you're telling me you actualy have no intention of using those 6+ year old chars you're so happy to have your names on anyways..? In which case, why does it bother you, exactly? =S<br />

It doesn't bother me.. hence the &quot;oh well&quot;. Sorry I made you get all passive aggressive.</div></div><hr />

If people that used to play want to keep their names, they're forced to log into those characters, thereby requiring an active sub to do that. They're holding people's names hostage in an attempt to try and mask that this is a dying game, and that quarter 3 is probably the biggest losses we've seen this expansion if not ever. <br />

I have a few alts that I probably haven't logged into in a long time, but my sub is currently out because there's nothing to do until WoD. I'm not going to resub, but I will cancel my account entirely if they take those alt names from me. I chose them, I play them, they're mine on my servers.

If you have alts that you haven't played for 6 years, then that's your problem. Clearly you don't want to play them, and considering it's been so long, I highly doubt you are ever going to play them.<br />
<br />
Stop being so selfish. You're literally complaining and making a fuss over nothing. It's people like you that are ruining the community. Always negative and talking about how the games dying, always hating on Blizzard for EVERYTHING they do, etc etc. Please, just stop.<br />
<br />
You don't play. Good for you. Leave the people that do actively play to enjoy what their doing.</div></div><hr />

If you havent logged onto your alts in the past 6 years you are not gonna play them again... and therefor you dont deserve to keep your names.<br />

If you dont play the game anymore, you have no reason to keep cool names away from those who actually do.</div></div><hr />

I can't imagine anyone who hasn't played a game in 6 years returning just to secure their name. That being said given WOD being about 90% focused on trying to lure back old players presumably this might work with some &amp; Blizzard is assuming they might decide to stick around &amp; play WOD. <br />

Good luck to them, I still think they'll be launching WOD with less than 6 million players subscribed but I guess they are desperate enough at this point that anything is worth a shot.</div></div><hr />

Any thing that you remotely even need to 'login for' that has even the faintest hint of a time limit lining up with ANY date of the year is somehow Blizzard forcing you to fork over a fortune for some large, unmissable event or item that specifically ties with the date of 'insert perfect time for financial quarter beginning/ending/halfway/quarter of a way in/quarter of a way out/waxing and waning of the moon/the stars aligning/the Messiah being born'. <br />

It's like their rants on the forums are going to make people quit WoW or something. <br />
<br />
This is a good decision by Blizzard and one of the many nice things that are happening to this game this year. So many people are going to come back to WoW when WoD hits and so many pathetic F2P games are going to die again. (hello Archeage hype train)</div></div><hr />

Ha, that is EXACTLY what I was just thinking when I heard about this. However it's also kind of nice because this means a lot of good names will be freed that might not otherwise have been. Example, one name I wanted on Illidan was taken. I asked the GM to free it but he told me he can't because while that character/name hasn't been logged in for years, the account itself is still active. So that meant that name can't be freed. <br />
<br />
But yeah I don't see why anyone is really mad about this. If you haven't played in 6 years then chances of you playing again are slim to none.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people are complaining but honestly if you *still* care about a character name, a character name, that existed 6 years ago then you'll probably care enough to resub and protect the name. If you have a contention about the whole thing then don't have beef with Blizzard, simply realise it's time to move on and that your character name was, is and will be a thing of the past and -for the best -your memory.</div></div><hr />

You are right. It is designed to force players who didn't log in for 6 years to purchase subscription for game they will never play again anyway. They even made sure such players know about it by making a blue post, which all players who left game 6 years ago read daily. *tinfoil hat*</div></div><hr />

Blizzard don't make good content anymore to get back old players, they punish them if they not pay again. Nice concept, you are on the right path!<br />
It is like Blizzard get back their game from the old players who bought this game too. Interesting. It has got a good taste in the mouth when veteran gamers want to go back but there are no more named characters on their account.<br />

The greed is real!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know the content until SoO. And I see only copy-paste raids and dungeons after WotlK.<br />
<br />
I am sorry if my opinion hurt you, I just replied for those who think It's not all about the money... <br />
I know 4-5 people who had to stop playing this game for a long time because more responsibility in their life (family, children, work, become poor etc.) and one day when they settled down would like to come back and get some fun again.<br />
<br />
Blaming this on greed is a bit far fetched, all they're doing is freeing up the names and any dormant account will have there characters flagged for a rename when or if they ever log in again. There's no financial gain in there at all, they're not saying that if you find your name has been used by someone else you have to pay for a new name.<br />
<br />
As I see things it'll be exactly the same thing that happens when you copy a character for PTR and Beta realms, as with those they'll always be the likelyhood that the old name will still be available if you try to use it. Over the last 10 years there will be millions of character names locked to realms that in reality are never ever going to be reactivated, it doesn't make sense for Blizzard to keep these names locked on the off chance that several thousand of them may one day be logged into after what already been 6 years of inactivity.<br />
<br />
The &lt;charactername&gt;@&lt;realmname&gt; isn't all that much different from a Domain Name, if you stop paying the lease then it's free for anyone to jump in and use. If after several years you find someone else is now using it you can't suddenly lay claim to it as being yours because you had it first. In my opinion the 6 year window is more than generous, I know we all become attached to out character names but at the end of the day it's their game. I'd understand people complaining if they were flagging every name that isn't attached to an active subscription but we're talking about people who haven't played or logged into the game for several expansions. I'd imagine that 99% of the names they're unlocking belong to people who &quot;1) Will never know&quot;, &quot;2) Couldn't care less&quot; or &quot;3) Are dead&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: As others have mentioned, for anyone who hasn't played for 6 years and cares about their character names there's the free 10 day trial.</div></div><hr />

If they have not played in 6 years, chances are they're not coming back. Quite frankly they've had 6 years and 3 expansions to decide if they will come back. If 3 expansions later they've not resubbed or logged in, that's their loss. I'm sorry but this is far from &quot;Resub now to keep your name&quot;. 6 years is a very long time to decide if you want to come back or not. If it takes you that long, then you just don't enjoy the game anymore and won't ever. Period. That's more than half of the game's lifetime to decide. <br />
<br />
Most people that have been inactive for 6 years have probably received an e-mail for a free 10 days of gametime to decide if they still enjoy it. They can easily retrieve their name and prevent it from being taken if they really wanted to. If they don't, then that's on them, not Blizzard. <br />
<br />
I'm assuming you realize they're only taking names from inactive characters from 2008, and not onwards (Let me make this simple for you; any character that has been inactive in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 or 2013 won't have their names taken from them.) You've had since 2008 to decide if you've wanted to play Warcraft again or not; that's 6 years! If you haven't played it since then, you should probably drop this unhealthy obsession of bad mouthing them. An obsession that stems 6 years is a bad unhealthy thing.</div></div><hr />

But lets look at the other side. You are a player that has not played WoW for 6 years. You have lets say played on a couple of different realms and you have lets say 31 characters. Now all those Characters get a FREE RENAME SERVICE when you start to play WoW again. I mean that is a Bunch of money that those players get for FREE. <br />
<br />
This is so unfair! I want free RENAME SERVICE for all of my characters! FU** U Blizz!!!!</div></div><hr />

Part of the problem is these names have been tied up since 2004 or whatever. If people quit and don't come back, they are still tied up and not available for people who do play. This isn't a renaming service, this is a service for people playing and want to have certain names that otherwise sit in the beyond section at Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond.<br />
<br />
The amount of bitching about this is ridiculous. I'm betting a good majority of the people complaining don't even play the game, as it's typically standard in society to bitch and moan about things that don't even affect us. And if you are bitching and still play, you're stupid as a person for speaking before actually knowing something.<br />
<br />
Also note I'm not specifically talking to you Tallemo.</div></div><hr />

They have 10 free days on their account. All they need is to log in - FOR FREE. That's all. If they can't be bothered to do that they still don't lose their character - just the name. Really people, stop the whining about nothing.<br />
<br />
Blizzard took away my free 10-day trial when they gave me MoP for free. I'm not allowed logging in unless I pay $15 for the monthly fee. They gave me a $10 product for free, and to use it, I have to pay $15, so they make $5 profit. They're a greedy, sneaky company now.</div></div><hr />

You haven't played that character/account in 6 years, now all of a sudden you're at risk of losing your name you suddenly care? You've had 6 years to decide whether or not you want to play again, hell that's 3 expansions and more than half of the game's life. If you still are not wanting to play after 6 years, it's quite clear you probably won't come back. If you're intrigued by what WoD brings, you can sub a week before 6.0 and keep your character's names. If not, well then that's on you for not having a genuine interest after such a long time and probably should drop this 6 year obsession. It's unhealthy dude.<br />
<br />
No sympathy for someone that hasn't played in 6 years and now suddenly cares because their oh-so-precious name is under threat. People like you seriously need to just.. Distance yourselves from the game and it's development because you have shown zero loyalty to them, zero care to their every expansion past Wrath. Just leave.</div></div><hr />
