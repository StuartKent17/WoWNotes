After years in exile, the Darkspear trolls are preparing to invade the Echo Isles and reclaim the land once bestowed to them by Thrall. Led by Vol'jin, a wise and highly regarded Darkspear, the tribe's bravest warriors will set out from Orgrimmar and Sen'jin Village, seeking to bring about Zalazane's fall and begin the process of rebuilding their homes and villages on the Echo Isles. In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, new troll adventurers will begin their journey on these tiny islands off the coast of Durotar, where they'll be able to experience this time of trial and transition firsthand.<br />
<br />
Though the Darkspears may once again have their land, the tribe's turmoil is far from over. The impending cataclysm will spark rivalry among the Horde leadership, and after years of running from a seemingly endless string of conflicts to preserve the Darkspear nation, Vol'jin is done fleeing. The Darkspears have reclaimed their islands and have no intention of settling elsewhere. Of course, as an untested member of the tribe, you'll have some training to do before tackling the Darkspears' larger matters.<br />
<br />
Every great hero starts somewhere. As a troll of the Echo Isles, the journey begins with safeguarding your people's well-being. Early in your adventures, you'll be charged with protecting the local Bloodtalon raptors and hatchlings from the sorcery of a nearby sea witch, slaying the beasts that feast upon the Darkspears' primary food sources, and assaulting the naga who've overrun the northern isle. But it won't be long before Vol'jin trusts you with vital -- and potentially dangerous -- information about the political struggles plaguing the Horde and, ultimately, the fellow members of your tribe.<br />
<br />
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, you'll face these trials and more in the trolls' new and enhanced introductory questing experience (level 1 to 5). Be steadfast and honorable, and your actions will help usher in a new era of Darkspear perseverance in a time of ultimate peril.<br />

<br />
The real zalazane's actually raid-boss power, the ones we always killed were trolls hexxed to look like him<br />
<br />
We're going to need the help of vol'jin, the tiger loa zintabra, and the watcher of the darkspear dead to defeat him for good<br />
<br />
Also, something I caught about that bit with the horde's politics, could this mean there's more anger at garrosh's rise to power than just from the playerbase?</div></div><hr />

no it will be like valley of trials or northshire abbey, just a 1-5 place, which is a shame really, these look great and its a pity we'll only get to experiance them for like 30 minutes, I guess there couldnt be much done on that though<br />

only question though is if this is just a starting area will voljin be there ?</div></div><hr />

PS: To all the people being amazed by the new water effects - do you really measure the quality of water effects in WoW just by comparing it to the one we have atm? It sure looks better but damn, it's on the level of Fable 1 graphics (and that even had little waves, splashes if you fiddle around it)... I doubt WoW: Cataclysm water effects will ever have that xD</div></div><hr />

I think it would be neat if they had players choose a side (Garrosh or Vol'jin) and you were hostile to whomever chose the other side. Then you could actually feel like there was a true uprising when fighting other players and NPCs.</div></div><hr />

That kinda graphics doesn't hog power at all, only if you set it to like ultra high, the ripple effects can probably be disabled, actually it probably can be set to old school water for people who cant handle the new graphics (But like seriously? the 1 gig Nvidia are like 70$ maybe upgrade?).</div></div><hr />

In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, you'll face these trials and more in the trolls' new and enhanced introductory questing experience (level 1 to 5). Be steadfast and honorable, and your actions will help usher in a new era of Darkspear perseverance in a time of ultimate peril.<br />
<br />
<br />
And like someone said earlier: Training dummies != City.<br />
<br />
Echo Isles, like the surface of Gnomeregan are starting zones for Trolls and Gnomes.<br />
<br />
Nothing will stop you from hanging out in the Troll Starting area, but you will have to travel to Ogrimmar for all your banking/auctioneering/trade chat needs.</div></div><hr />

Nope just sweet Starting Zones, they still share the major City with Orcs and the Gobby's<br />

They have to update it becasue water is going to have new mechanics (and play a big role) with both combat and riding. There is a massive underwater deep sea zone (and probably other areas, including 1 dungeon underwater and at least 1 underwater raid).<br />

<br />
sadly they may catch up only with water textures( which look very Morrowind-like), ambience textures are still very unsharp and are using DirectX 9-graphics or maybe DirectX 8.Other thing is how much performance will water effects really cost ( see shadows introduced with woltk).As far as i´m concerned this graphic upgrade is sth not been designed for wow-engine,and it will be a reason for hardware hunger.</div></div><hr />

No. If you read carefully all that is saying is that Vol'Jin is tired of running and plans on reclaiming the land that is rightfully his. Other than that, just like any story with a narrative, all that blue post is saying is that IN the Cataclysm there will be rivalry between the Horde's leadership. Nowhere in that sentence does it infer that the Horde is aware of Deathwing's return or of a cataclysmic event at this time, but they obviously WILL be come the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A little food for thought, through the Lore it's known that Trolls try to disassociate themselves from the forsaken, seeing them as restless spirits, and whilst there's not much on the Blood Elves relationship with the Darkspear it's important to remember that they're outcasted Night Elves which were responsible for pretty much annihilating the Troll empires. Ontop of that, the main reason the Darkspear are part of the Horde is purely down to Thrall's influence and Sen'jin's trust in him, and they're only real allies within the Horde being Thrall &amp; the Taurens, it's going to be very interesting to see how this plays out when:-<br />
<br />
Thrall leaves<br />
Garrosh takes up warchief, an Orc who's proven to be very hotheaded recently<br />
the possible removal of Cairne creating more friction within<br />
The Forsaken's loyalty from within being under great scrutiny<br />
and the fact that noone still cares who Lor'Themar is<br />
<br />
I'm getting a vibe that the Horde will be on the verge of destabalization come the end of Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

Like I like how this helps the story progress, good lore and gives us something to do until cata (and helps introduce cata) but doesn't seem at all logical T_T.<br />

<br />
<br />
No. Technically, Cataclysm (the expansion) is just both new races, their starting zones and new zones from 80 up. Everything else will be available to everyone and encompases considerable update of existing content. As with previous expansions, the preparation patch will be released before the actual expansion, with evidence of a pre-expansion event (gnomereagan/echo isles liberations, as well as some other stuff).<br />
<br />
Regarding the post, interesting info on political situation. So Garrosh doesn't have full support (something we already knew from cata web page, really, it was just vague) and Thrall leaving is somewhat unfortunate. Something tells me we're gonna see major civil war, followed by triumphant return of Thrall near the end of Cataclysm. Unfortunately, it may well be too late to prevent a major conflict between Alliance and Horde by then.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if cata will bring a DX10/11 client, or maybe just switch compleatly to OGL3.2. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blizz will likely never move to DirectX, they wouldn't be able to share as much code between the Windows and Mac clients. Using OGL is why they've always been able to release Windows and Mac version of everything simultaneously and seamlessly (well part of why). Given that they continued to maintain a virtually identical game experience on the two platforms for years when Apple appeared two steps from the grave, I doubt they'll change now that Mac's have a measurable and growing market share.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I understand it, both the Echo Isles and Gnomeregan are going to be pre-Cata events. Pretty sure a while ago it was hinted at that regardless of level, you'd be able to have some involvement, whether that's killing boars to feed the armies or being part of the honour guard of Vol'Jin making the first initial push to claim back the isles. Those skulls we took were just troll voodoo mon! Drifts wood effigies or mind slaves cunningly disguised by Zalazane. Each level is going to have something to do. There will be phased encounters depending on level I assume, the final level 80 encounter unlocking when each other level zone has been completed in some way.<br />
<br />
The Island city itself looks nice, if a little exposed. But it doesn't look like a city. Not enough hustle and bustle. I remember hearing that Garrosh rebuilds Org out of metal and kicks all but Orcs and Tauren out as they're &quot;too weak&quot; to defend its walls. If this is true, the trolls will need a refugee camp of some sort.</div></div><hr />
