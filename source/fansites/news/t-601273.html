<br />
Transcended (http://www.transcended.org/) released a video of their fight (http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=40076) against Anetheron, 2nd boss of Hyjal Summit. They just fought the boss itself and not the trash waves (a GM deathtouched them) that are part of the event before the fight, it may look easier than what it will be on live servers. <br />

Method Interview<br />
Method will be interviewed on WoW Radio (http://www.wcradio.com)'s flagship show 'Blue Plz!' on Sunday 13th of May about their Lady Vashj kill and end-game experiences. Join them for a musical preshow at 17:30 servertime (Paris time) (11:30 EST) with the live show kicking off at 18:30 servertime (12:30 EST).<br />
The interview is 60 minutes long and will include a full run down of everything Vashj related, all the bugs, and tons of drama + general opinions on end-game raiding.<br />

Arena (Via WoWinsider (http://www.wowinsider.com/))<br />
The Arena System Q&amp;A #2 (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=285038857&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#1) was updated on the official forums, we now have the list of the titles that players will be able to chose at the end of the season based on their ranking. <br />
Q: What ranks can we earn?<br />
A: There will be 4 titles total for players to earn. The ranking needed for each Arena title is as follows: (Rankings are based by Battlegroup):<br />
% - .5% : Gladiator (and Armoured Nether Drake sent in mail)<br />
.5% - 3% : Duelist<br />
3% - 10% : Rival<br />
10% - 35% : Challenger <br />
<br />
Screenshots<br />
Endarion (yup, again.) sent me a lot of screenshots showing the different colors of new 2.1.0 items. That's a lot of different skins, probably for a lot of different loots !<br />
