Does a loyalty system makes sense in WoW lore, could it be possible? <br />
for example: a newborn character should gain rep faster with his kin, however , this new loyalty system would now enable your relations with whoever you face in WoW. Now you ask: Can a player cross sides after a while ? Can a player join a factions and pledge loyalty to it? <br />
<br />
I ask you , why not? <br />
<br />
This is what languages were meant for, along with reputation. To be achievable!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nightstalker</div><div class="date">2018-11-01, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did they feel like they've overdone it with an early gear catchup system via the Arathi rare grind that completely devalued all of the BFA zone World Quest reward items?<br />
Why was the Honorbound/7th Legion War campaign quest chain so short? With Suramar players had months of weekly content tied into a great storyline.<br />
Why do Warfronts feel like a Stop&amp;Go Dragrace? Constantly waiting for people to just turn in all the materials at once and then having to wait for the slow demolisher crawl towards the gate.<br />
Why does the battle end so abruptly once the gate in the opposing factions warfront base is breached? In the Outdoor Area you see a completely damaged base which should have been the result of your actions inside the warfront scenario. If this feature should feel like Warcraft 3 it should not just be building a base (the same every time) and then killing the leader of the other faction. It should also involve tearing down the enemies base which was done a lot better in Wintergrasp 10 years ago!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fazaim</div><div class="date">2018-11-01, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Question 1: Do you still consider the older talent trees as an &quot;illusion of choice&quot;?<br />
Do you agree that we both now and then could google the cookie-cutter build, but you left us no room to experiment with in this newer version of talent trees?<br />
<br />
Opinion: Without artifact trees and legendary effects we have lost a good amount of synergy in our rotation. <br />
<br />
Question 2: Do you think it's time to sacrifice some specialization fantasy (which it really is) for class fantasy and personal character identity?<br />
<br />
Opinion on the matter: I used to be a rogue who specialized in combat, instead of lurking in the shadow I stepped toe to toe with warriors, parrying their attacks and disarming them. I used to be a mage who used knowledge in the arcane to cast instant pyroblasts and I could slow enemy's with cone of cold or frostbolt to get away. And my sheet of choices were accompanied with beautiful artwork in the background. I could base my character around my own fantasy of the class. I could spread my skills across different styles and mix the martial arts.</div></div><hr />

Warmode certainly brought the light that there are a lot more Horde players than Alliance.<br />
<br />
Even the Mythic Hall of Fame shows it. There was a time most high rated PvPers were alliance, and top PvErs were horde. Now everyone is Horde.</div></div><hr />

Is this intended or a bug and if it was intended whats the intention behind this design? It makes no sense when a player only plays the caster dd and can't trade a trinket he doesn't need, like for example in my raid the Mythrax trinket and the moonkin. He needs to loot a higher healer trinket before he can trade this trinket. Whats with this failure in the personal loot system that was forced on us in every situation or do we get the option back for masterloot or do you intend to loosen some of the trade restrictions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Randir076</div><div class="date">2018-11-02, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">QUESTION 1: Will we ever see weapon restrictions on abilities for certain specs removed? <br />
EXPLANATION: BM Monks, WW Monks, Frost DKs, and Fury Warriors are mainly the ones it affects the most. All have these arbitrary limitations on weapon use in their spec even though they have those weapon skills. It still seems very clunky after Legion especially in the case of Death Knights, as they have the only dps spec that uses one handed strength weapons which means they have to compete with tanks for loot drops. Meanwhile Guardian Druids and Vengeance Demon Hunters use the exact same weapons as their dps counterparts with no restrictions given, with druids having the only two melee specs in the whole game that are able to switch between dual wielding and 2handers<br />
<br />
<br />
QUESTION 2: For dungeons, what is the purpose behind still having a heroic and normal difficulty? <br />
EXPLANATION: Heroic in particular has such a small lifespan, it requires an item level of 305 but really only lasts until 320 because of Warfronts and LFR. Also especially due to mythic and mythic+ dungeons they fall into total obscurity for the endgame. And since Warfronts were released, the only time I've ever had reason for an alt to queue for a heroic dungeon was to get that last bit of small item level difference that world quests or the rares in Arathi couldn't get me, and after 4 alts that's only ever happened once. After that, the only reason I ever touch them is if there's a world quest involved, and that's very rare since the time spent doing that usually isn't worth it. Both difficulties should be combined with a similar loot scaling system to world quests added in, which would also benefit leveling players with faster queue times due to the increased queue pool.<br />
<br />
<br />
QUESTION 3: After the large changes to professions, will racials ever be altered to accommodate for the new system? <br />
EXPLANATION: Having additional points in a profession offers no benefit anymore, especially with gathering professions. Dark Iron, Lightforged, Worgen, Tauren, Dwarves, and Highmountain all have traits that permit additional benefits to their profession racials that are actually very fun and add to the race. Meanwhile Gnomes, Draenei, Blood Elves, Goblins, Nightborne, and even Pandaren are given a racial that feels entirely useless no matter how they are played and add no identity to the race at all, and also in some cases feels like it takes away would could have been another better racial in its place.</div></div><hr />

On one hand, it is nice that we can make one piece of gear become viable to more specs, allowing us to potentially generate revenue. The problem is that we have absolutely no control over what we end up with. It feels like we are getting materials to make a lever for a slot machine than we are making a product. Can you guys create a system where we have more control of what we can make? Plenty of materials to make items, and yet no impact or difference to how it works is making us push away from creating products and instead farm materials for better gold profits as it is more reliable and stable.</div></div><hr />

Im tired of there being so many professions and none of them really requiring many cross profession mats or alchemy being the only real consumable creating profession. I want the old rp of vanilla where gear isnt the old thing your looking for out of a raid/dungeon. Why is aZerite the pnly real resource we look for when each expansion adds a new herb/mineral/skin/etc... when can we see a change to professions that isnt just heres your epic alchemy stone /jewel and thats it for professions this expansion?

If their niche is supposed to be stacked healing, but raid fights tend to move more and more away from raid stacking because it limits the engaging abilities that can be included, then in order to tune shamans to compete with other healers on non-stacked fights, they would far outperform every healer on stacked fights. No other healers seems to have a niche problem this complicated.</div></div><hr />

Right now they are a prestige reward for players. Returning players come attracted by their advertisement and have difficulty to unlock them, especially the ones requiring legacy content. For example remove exalted with faction requirement and leave that for heritage armors.<br />
<br />
Also can heritage armor requirements for allied races be equal to normal races in the future: exalted with their faction and unlocked by their exclusive scenario?<br />

There have been many blizzard promotions and wow specific promotions events such as the &quot;10 year Molten Core anniversary&quot; or the &quot;Tarren mil vs. South shore battle&quot;, the &quot;Azeroth Choppers&quot; event and some others! I wanted to ask this - if there is big enough interest in the community to make those items available again would you actually do it? Maybe as rewards that can be bought with tokens from the wow anniversary annual event vendor or in some other way? I, like many others, simply didn't play wow back then, but was very disappointed when i found out you cant get those rewards anymore after i started playing in WoD! Im sure an event like that, to get those rewards again, would generate much interest and publicity for the game ( not to mention lots of play time for the player base)! Thanks for asking my question in advance and have a happy Blizzcon celebration! ;)</div></div><hr />

Me and my friends having a blast playing BfA despite all sayings toward it. There are tons of activity to do while playing with 5 man group of friends. Yet there is one thing we cannot call neither fun nor activity. It is raiding. The premade group established standart raid size 2/3/9 or 2/4/14 and nobody want to make them smaller or more fluent depending on classes, so it became the opposite of flexible, people keep thinking that more people = more loot, yet there is more mistakes or leavers or loot grinders, if we trying to make smaller size group people just arguing that bosses are harder to kill, so question is there any chances of making flexible raid size more flexible. Making a group of larger size just to be sure that you will get a loot or someone else will get it to trade with is not the definition of flexbility</div></div><hr />

All these features changed the gameplay and made it more diverse, more dynamic. Many people pumped these classes precisely because of these abilities.<br />

Warfront: what happened about creative quests for the zone, maybe add some &quot;Down to earth&quot;quests with some story. Instead of boring &quot;kill 20 bla bla&quot; quests.<br />
<br />
Azeroth: what about making the world be a lot more relevant, for example add some incursions in low level zones. Or the way you did it in WoD, where u had a max level area in each zone, where there might be some world quests at times, just sometimes and not all the time. You got alot of Mountain areas to fill by the classic zones.<br />
<br />

Right now structured PvE on Alliance is dead, mostly due to the Horde racials being stronger for the majority of the time the game existed. Balancing racials alone is too little and too late, noone is gonna switch back just because the Horde's pool of players is 10x higher. You've created encounters that favour one faction (KJ with goblins, Zul with blood elves) and allowed Blood Elves to rule in m+ for the entirety of Legion, so what are the plans to deal with that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) How impactful of a choice will this be? No lore specifics needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Will this feature be implemented more in the future? If so will it be for both Alliance and Horde?<br />
<br />
<br />
I like this idea as a way of personalizing the experience for each person. Also making it feel like you choose the causes you support. Could be a neat system for future faction relations if expanded on. <br />

We are getting more sets, but they lack uniqueness. The tier 1-3 warfront sets are just elaborate versions of the same set, as is the Mythic compared to LFR-Heroic. It was said we would be getting higher quality, but so far we have only been getting higher quantity. Will class tier armor set appearances make a return?

Their fans ave stayed loyal, and refuse to surrender to the Horde, especially now, when faction matters more than ever.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rowaasr13</div><div class="date">2018-11-02, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've posted those as separate posts on EU forums already, but here it is as a nice wall of text just in case you'll like any.<br />
<br />
Can't you add back all &quot;when it was current&quot; rewards (titles, mounts, etc) with system similar to Ulduar's &quot;Herald of the Titans&quot; achievement.<br />
<br />
Can we make learned RECIPES account-wide? Each character would still start from 0 skill points and need to retrain them by crafting on changing profession, but there would be no fear of losing rare or even permanently losing no longer available recipes.<br />
<br />
Can we have cross-faction instanced PvE groups - being locked out of playing together with half of player base is not fun.<br />
Also, there are numerous drawbacks to &quot;faction war&quot; stories. You can't please everyone, because someone have to lose and even winner can't have really noticeable win to preserve status quo. Can we please stop with such stories - they're not fun either.<br />
<br />
Will be any rewards (I'm mostly interested in transmogrification) that can be brought from Classic to Live?<br />
<br />
Why human language voiceover was added to Faceless and other Old God related creatures' Shath'Yar? It was much creepier before. Can we have option to turn it off, so human-readable part only appears in whispers as before?<br />
<br />
Merc mode grants honor, but doesn't grants reputation for 3 BGs where it matter. Can you please enable it? (Yes, that looks somewhat strange &quot;lorewise&quot;, but the merc mode itself does as well.)<br />
Also, since I switched main 2 times since I started playing, I have all of those BG reps sitting in &quot;Revered&quot; on several characters. Can those (and maybe some other) reputation maintain account-wide progress so progress on all characters will be added together? You did it with honor and honor kills already.<br />
<br />
Can you add &quot;spell transmogrification&quot; - a table of all possible animations used in past for a spell, so a player can select whatever version he liked most? Maybe even not just exclusive radio buttons, but an entire set of options for every spell. Like radio button for pyroblast - v1/v2/v3 and additional checkmarks for &quot;more glow&quot; and &quot;bigger explosion&quot;. You can make tons of questing content for unlocking each variant/checkmark. That will make big battles - i.e. raids - looks much more diverse instead of dozens of identical fireballs flying around.<br />
<br />
Back before Throne of Thunder, Shadowy Apparitions copied player's own look - race and gear. It was changed for performance reasons when Lei Shen's trinket produced just too many of those apparitions. Can we please have option of old look of SA back?<br />
<br />
Bikini plate and other similar armor is typical fantasy gear. Looking around any city or at prices on AH - they're as popular as ever for transmogrification. Why you no longer add items with such design (or add like one at most per expansion)?<br />
(Yes I know, there are vocal opponents for this, but surely there should be some statistics to see that they have many more silent admirers.)<br />
<br />
Can we have glyph/some other option for shadow priests and druids to completely disable spec and form visual effects? It feels really unfun when I look at all the transmogrification I've gathered and it doesn't matter in the end, since I ever can see them clearly only on login screen.<br />
<br />
Can you make all auto-LFG queues (both PvE and PvP) work while you're already in party? I hate choice of having to wait for other players of my current shard to wander in to elite WQ or dropping all my other queues for using LFG. I also would like to solo queue for BG/LFR while I'm already in a dungeon, for example.<br />
<br />
Are there plans to update resolution of old popular armor models or add new versions? A la ToS, but not only for tier armor?<br />
<br />
Violent Hemorrhage debuff uses icon with very interesting name &quot;sha_ability_warrior_bloodnova_nightmare&quot;. Were there any plans in MoP to have classes learn Sha-based abilities?<br />
<br />
Any plans to boost Vanquished Tendril of G'huun? It is so pathetic compared to other trinkets right now, so when it drops from FINAL boss or from a very rare heroic chest, it feels like spit in the face right now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">badzerath</div><div class="date">2018-11-02, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why do you feel it is necessary to arbitrarily restrict the amount of progress can be made on a character via mythic plus? Why not just allow azerite gear to drop from mythic plus chests or allow us to just earn a badge-like currency at the end of a mythic plus dungeon we can trade directly for upgrades? Even with the vendors being added the system seems designed to artificially inflate the amount of time required to acquire the gear I want for my character if I don't get lucky.That isn't fun or interesting.<br />
<br />
2. Why implement a system like azerite power that is designed to inherently have minimal impact on character progression, but yet simultaneously is supposed to motivate me to grind repetitive content in island expeditions as a means of personal character progression to unlock azerite traits I had on blue gear? <br />
<br />
3. Am I wrong for feeling that azerite traits are just a frustrating mixture of tier gear and old glyphs? <br />
<br />
4. Why would you charge me to reforge my azerite traits to optimize for the spec I want to play, but not charge me to change my spec to begin with? Do you believe hamstringing players who want/need to change spec often (that are also suffering from lack of azerite gear availability in the system you designed) is engaging?</div></div><hr />

Also has Blizzard thought of player housing since Garrisons? I know this feature received mixed reviews, I for one thought they were amazing and loved every aspect of them. Would you consider a &quot;Garrisons 2&quot; on Azeroth.
