The Sanctum is the PvP building-- it gives you PvP related open world bonuses, quests for killing your favored enemy race in PvP, and grants access to a PvP arena event. Unless you're a completionist and absolutely must have the level 3 version of all buildings, you probably wouldn't be using one of your limited slots on this one as a PvE player. <br />
<br />
It's similar to if, for example, you saw that the pet battle level 3 building requires you to defeat all the Draenor battle pet trainers or complete x Draenor pet battles, then complained that you needed to pet battle in order to unlock the highest tier pet battle building. (Disclaimer-- I didn't look this up, and I'm not sure if this is how you unlock it.)</div></div><hr />

The map is a gameplay convenience, not a strict lore document. Our world map in game right now isn't an accurate depiction of what the twisting nether looks like between outland and azeroth and there aren't monsters off of the edge of the map.</div></div><hr />

Alright, but how will we be able to travel to both places at the same time? Outland will be through the dark portal and draenor is time travel if Im not mistaken?</div></div><hr />

you are missing the point, okey it is a convenience, but due to Cataclysm Azeroth changed, and since Garosh has altered the timeline how can Outland still exsist? there is no pre-Cata version of Azeroth for anyones convenience, but here we have Azeroth til lvl 60 than OUTLAND from 60-70 yada yada yada... and than we got Draenor at 90... how??? if Garosh altered the timeline Outland should simply not exsist, just a matter of technicality, how are you going to go to Outland and/or Draenor, when there only supposed to be 1 Dark Portal, either its to one or the other, not both, or they will make it level based and you cant see or know about the current lvl 90 timeline until you get to lvl 90, since your game has not progressed to that time in the game yet, should/could have done the same with Cata aswell btw, guess it was easier if they are solving it like this with Draenor since its a totally standalone place not a part of Azeroth</div></div><hr />

Alright, but how will we be able to travel to both places at the same time? Outland will be through the dark portal and draenor is time travel if Im not mistaken?<br />

The current timeline portal will change red once you take the quest and no longer take you to outlands, but I imagine once you hit the portal it will give you the option once it is finished.<br />

All timelines are always progressing forwards and backwards at all times and interwoven into the fabric of space time, imagine an infinite amount of strands of infinitely small strings represent each timeline woven into a rope and then someone adds a loop around 2 of the strands creating a link between 2 points in space and time. Regardless of the distance and time they are now linked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No need to be such an jerk, especially when I don't think you quite get it either. The changes in this build have nothing to do with the design of abilities; Celestalon said they're essentially done with that phase. They are on the tuning phase now, and this build represents the first round of tuning changes. The concern raised is that in the first round of tuning passes they're taking a fairly weak class on beta and nerfing it. While your point that they just started is correct and things can change, it's a fairly ominous start.</div></div><hr />

In the original design, I always just assumed they were supposed to represent Medivh and Gul'dan, the twin masterminds behind the portal. <br />
<br />
It's kind of cool to think that though the impetus behind the portal was to prepare for a Legion invasion, and Medivh was controlled by Sargeras at the time, that one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of the two worlds was masterminded by an orc and a human working together.</div></div><hr />

Well that sort of takes the drama out of it. As someone who has leveled countless toons, I don't really care, but for someone who hasn't I hope they at least plan something to make it make sense rather than just head to major city and get ported to Hellfire. In the grand scheme of things, it's not very important though.</div></div><hr />

The bit that's always confused me is that there's a sculpture of a dragon on top of the gate on the Draenor side, yet AFAIK there were no dragons on Draenor till after the portal was opened.</div></div><hr />
