WHY<br />
<br />
<br />
Because Blizzard thought shammy pvp burst was too much. Whether this is true or not I don't know but I believe that was the reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't really see a difference.<br />
<br />
All i see one is darker than the other. So it just boils down to personal preference. <br />
<br />
At least it means I'll be satisfied with the 10man version. Unlike Ulduar raider drakes, where 25 version is the best looking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In certain circumstances you could cancel eclipse if the time left was less than the cast time of Starfire or Wrath, therefore jumping into next eclipse short of the 15 second timer.<br />
<br />
But somebody at Blizzard has a raging boner to keep the balance druid down and thus figured they HAD to do something.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, the t8 2pc bonus nerf. Way to go Blizz, learn to make gear IMO.</div></div><hr />

Nope...but the 2pc T8 nerf is a NERF. They are essentially FORCING us into using a SHITTY T9 set. Fuck off Blizzard IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a nerf if you didn't use it (because you were effectively gimping yourself), major nerf if you did.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc73fb8ac2b2</div><div class="date">2009-11-24, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to refrain from profanity, but the fact is that I am livid at the Balance druid nerf right now.

Between the two HUGE (and by HUGE I mean GIGANTIC) nerfs, I can't see how Blizzard can even show their faces. They disgust me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel ashamed to be the same class as this guy. Talk about drama.<br />
<br />
I'm a moonkin. My dps doesn't top the charts, but it's sufficient for togc25. I don't use WisEclipse, I recently jumped from 2xT8/2xT9 to 4xT9. Neither of these nerfs are HUGE, nor are they GIGANTIC.<br />
<br />
WisEclipse saved you a cast on your eclipse. If you needed this addon to do sufficient dps, you were probably doing it wrong anyway. If your idea of doing enough DPS in a raid was topping the meters, then your view of &quot;enough&quot; is off by a mile. Moonkins are hybrids, supportive buffers of the raid's casters. That's the reason we don't top charts, however this &quot;nerf&quot; DOES NOT make us useless.<br />
<br />
The 2PCT8 nerf also isn't as big as is being claimed. The difference between 2xT8/2xT9 and 4xT9 is not very big at all, and in fact as you gain higher ilevel gear, 4xT9 actually overtakes the alternative (Would you imagine that, the higher tier actually beats the lower tier at higher gear levels :O). It's a nerf, granted, but now you have a reason to get the T9 that you would've wanted eventually in your quest for minmaxing your dps.<br />
<br />
P.S. Grammar and spelling may be way off in places. Tiredness ftw.</div></div><hr />

If you realy think wise eclipse will only get you a slight dps boost you propably should refrain from talking about other people doing something wrong, as you obviously don't know what you are talking about yourself.<br />
<br />
And 4xT9 is only superior if you can't use your eclipse procs, but since we will get t10 when this changes go live it doesn't matter unless you are just catching up.</div></div><hr />

Elemental Mastery now gives you 15% spell haste for 15 sec instead of increasing your critical strike chance.<br />

<br />
If I had to guess it would be something to do with the fact that shamans already easily hit 50% critical strike rating with decent gear without this talent and at that point critical strike rating becomes rather pointless and haste starts scaling a lot better. Just a thought though.</div></div><hr />

Fixing a bug is a nerf? Seriously! I don't like that they are RNG dependent anymore than the next kin, but there is no way allowing a bug to help make up for part of that is going to make it easier for Blizzard to justify a buff.<br />

Not to mention, the t8 2pc bonus nerf. Way to go Blizz, learn to make gear IMO.<br />

<br />
Blizzard has said time and time again that when you set a bonus up so that its so good that people have issues decided rather they should upgrade to the next tier or not then its time to nerf that bonus when the next tier is out. That is the case here. When it was just T8 the bonus was fine. Now, it needs nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding 4pc T9 or wise eclipse?<br />
<br />
Either way I can't realy provide proof right now, but on the matter of wiseeclipse: It is not only saving you a cast, but if you are in a lunar eclipse your starfire will still have the extra % crit from the eclipse, but will trigger the solar eclipse, so 95% of the time you will trigger your solar eclipse right after a lunar eclipse instead of wating for a lucky crit, thus a nice dps boost.</div></div><hr />

Now that they added the 15 second cool down I'll let the people that know theory crafting better than I do decide rather its still worth it to do what we did in 3.2 or if we should go back to before 3.2 when our focus was procing lunar only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Bug? A rather easy /cancelaura macro can perform the exact same function. It is about how THEY want the toon to be, not what the playerbase wants or thinks. Like I said elsewhere, some Blizzard dev got outdamaged on a boss fight by a boomkin and went emo.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SBS</div><div class="date">2009-11-24, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's probably a good thing that they fixed 2pT8 (which was balanced around the earlier way eclipse worked) and the &quot;bug&quot; that allowed you to just about always jump from lunar eclipse to solar, _but_ this is a good 600ish dps loss and balance druids aren't exactly OP as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's not what the addon does. It doesn't just track eclipse timers. SquawkAndAwe does that.<br />
<br />
I'll give the brief rundown in the hopes those who don't understand will read this and understand.<br />
<br />
Eclipse lasts 15 seconds. The opposite Eclipse will not proc while Eclipse is up. Eclipse procs for the opposite spell on CRIT. The Eclipse for Starfire increases Starfire's chance to CRIT 30%. Whether a spell crits or not is decided ON SPELLCAST (not on hit), but the Eclipse proc occurs on hit.<br />
<br />
All of the above will lead the logically-minded among you, even who don't know a thing about boomkins, to realize there's a big opportunity here. After the last Starfire you'll be able to cast under the Eclipse timer leaves your hands, you can /cancelaura Ecilpse. That Starfire still gets +30% chance to crit, which raid-buffed is nearly 100%, so you'll proc the Wrath Eclipse immediately upon that Starfire hitting the target. NOT using WiseEclipse or manually using a /cancelaura macro at the proper time means casting more unbuffed Starfires (at least one per rotation, if not more), because you'll need to cast it at least one more time for the Starfire Eclipse to have fallen off on its own by the time it hits the target, and since that Starfire is getting 30% less crit, there is a reasonable chance you'll need to cast more to get one to crit. In addition, due to chain casting, you'll be halfway through ANOTHER Starfire cast when Wrath Eclipse finally procs, meaning you lose some Wrath Eclipse time. Using the addon/cancelaura you can start casting Wrath immediately after the last Starfire of that Eclipse, assuming it'll crit, since its crit rate is above 90%.<br />
<br />
Now all of the above in reality amounts to a 3-5% increase in dps over not using the above. But that's still an increase. Boomkins who didn't use an addon or manually /cancelaura will see no changes from that nerf, since both Eclipses can't be up simultaneously anyway.<br />
<br />
The reason for the nerf isn't to &quot;keep boomkins down&quot; or anything silly like that. And the addon wasn't an exploit, nor was any of this due to a bug. It's normal game mechanics, NOT a bug. However, it IS unintuitive play (no one can say it's INTUITIVE to cancel a buff early in order to increase your dps) and Blizzard doesn't like unintuitive play. It was changed for the exact same reason as the rogue poison change, to remove an addon from being functionally necessary for maximum dps with the spec.<br />
<br />
The difference was that the rogue change was done dps-neutral with rogues USING the addon, and a dps increase to rogues not using the addon. The boomkin change was done dps-neutral with boomkins NOT using the addon, and a dps decrease to boomkins using the addon.<br />
<br />
The 2pT8 change was also necessary, since boomkins without access to Heroic 25-man Icecrown gear were going to STILL be using T8.5 gloves and shoulders with all their 25-man normal Icecrown gear. Which is silly. Blizz doesn't like people using one tier old gear (see shaman T9 set bonus change), much less two tiers old.<br />
<br />
However, while both changes were good and necessary changes, both of them are nerfs, yes. So the only thing I can hope is boomkins get some kind of buff baked in to make up for them. Because I'd really hate to see boomkins drop down to shadow priest levels at the bottom of the pack. Hell, with the frost mage changes in 3.3, FROST may outdps shadow and balance, and THAT would just be sad.</div></div><hr />

Or maybe it just means they have a short week since it is Thanksgiving for us Americans this week after all. I'd expect them to work up to Wednesday and take a 4 day weekend.<br />

And by looking at the testing schedule of a regular week, they only give 3 days out of 5 regular working weekdays. 1 out of 3 isn't far-fetched either.

I don't play my rogue much anymore (mostly played him in vanilla), but isn't the rogue change a DPS increase to both because whenever you switch a weapon, you incur a GCD penalty (this was introduced in vanilla because of rogues switching in weapons with weapon chains on the off-hand while fighting warriors :P)?

<br />
<br />
The prevailing theorycrafting over at EJ has been saying overall rogues should see similar dps with this change as they had using the addon, which is a buff of a few hundred dps over not using the addon, but otherwise dps-neutral.<br />
<br />
It's still across the entire rogue population a buff (since not all of them were using the addon), while this change is across the entire boomkin population a nerf (since at least some of them were using their addon).<br />
<br />
I'm hoping for a boomkin baked-in buff to make up for these changes, but doubt it'll be in 3.3 directly. Maybe in a 3.3.2 rebalancing patch a few weeks later, perhaps alongside the start of the next arena season (and the addition of the Arthas fight, since it's looking more and more like 3.3 will release without that fight's data even in the patch, so people can't listen to sound files and know what's going to happen ahead of time).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As I understand the fight, there's very little RNG to that achievement at all. Very few people get the Vampiric Bite buff from Lana'thel herself (and with VERY bad luck you might keep getting it initially every time, but the chances of that more than a few weeks in a row would be quite low); most of the raid gets it from being bitten by other raid members. So for this achievement, you just make sure the raid leader gives standing orders NOT to bite X, Y, and Z this week so they can get the achievement, and cycle through your highest dps (since they'll be the highest priority for getting bitten under normal circumstances for the damage buff) like that until they all get it. Voila.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's probably because Blizzard heard so many PVE Ele shamans complaining about how they hated crit (see the T10 badge totem, got changed from crit to haste, because it was going to be a downgrade).<br />
<br />
I bet you someone was just like &quot;well, if they like haste so much, here's some more of it!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In certain circumstances you could cancel eclipse if the time left was less than the cast time of Starfire or Wrath, therefore jumping into next eclipse short of the 15 second timer.<br />
<br />
But somebody at Blizzard has a raging boner to keep the balance druid down and thus figured they HAD to do something.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, the t8 2pc bonus nerf. Way to go Blizz, learn to make gear IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is clearly the same issue as what they just went through with Mutilate Rogues. Blizzard doesn't want custom UIs or mods or timely buff canceling or weapon swapping to be mandatory to do competitive DPS, as any class.<br />
<br />
You should expect buffs in normal fashion if your DPS is too low after this. Blizzard is finished allowing wonky mechanics to exist just to keep a spec competitive.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
And good god, why would you want to keep using T8 when T10 is available? Who cares about old set bonuses?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope...but the 2pc T8 nerf is a NERF. They are essentially FORCING us into using a SHITTY T9 set. Fuck off Blizzard IMO. <br />

Do you want to know how atrocious moonkin DPS can be when you end up casting out of Eclipse because you had to move out of fire and lost the second half of your Lunar Eclipse and now you have to try proccing a Solar with a 2.2 sec cast crit?<br />
<br />
If they don't fix the variability in 3.3, I'm done with moonkin. It's not uncommon for Lunar Eclipse to REFUSE to proc for a good 20secs of chaincasting, through multiple crits. And in 3.3, you no longer get to transition from Lunar to Solar, so that doubles out of Eclipse casting time. Casts make up a good 80% of moonkin damage.<br />
<br />
The next upgrade from T8 is T10. Not T9. How soon do you think we can get T10? The only &quot;upgrade&quot; that we can reliably get is.... T9, which apart from 2pc T9.... is a DPS DOWNGRADE. Imagine that! T10 or bust.</div></div><hr />

You can't expect to be competitive in dps with old gear anyway, so no one really cares what happens with T9 or..hell even T8.<br />
The &quot;nerf&quot; was obviously implemented for the same reasons as the mutilate &quot;nerf&quot; for rogues.<br />
I still think moonkins are broken because they have a freaking crazy rotation. I mean it's not only RNG-based it's actually the definition of random.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um. There's a little thing being released at the same time as this nerf (hint: it's 3.3 PTR changes) called tier 10.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah I just leveled my 3rd alt (boomkin) to 80 and have been saving up badges for T8 2 set bonus seeing how running uld these days is pretty useless, but having a weaker boomkin T8 2 piece is just a major cock block.</div></div><hr />

Right now the best combo is 2T8, 2T9. After the patch, your DPS will drop by a few hundred according to current EJ modeling. Your upgrade path is to replace T8 with T10. What if you don't get T10? Miss a raid or two? You can't upgrade to T9 (purchasable with Emblems of Triumph).</div></div><hr />

I'm not the best moonkin but I was pulling a good 7k on the reg using the regular squawk and awe - going back and forth between eclipses. Some taking longer to proc than others.<br />
<br />
How did I not know about this wise eclipse addon? HOW? This is ridiculous. Instant proc for an eclipse. I can imagine this being a good 500 or so dps increase at least.<br />
<br />
Ah well, at least I can enjoy this for a few weeks until it gets nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a nerf to our dps because we're back in that little niche where when we want burst damage for a certain amount of time, the best we can do is pop a wild magic potion and hope that Eclipse lines up again rather than get out a solid chunk of Eclipse procs with very little holes of downtime.<br />

If you've never cancelled your Eclipse buffs early, this nerf will do absolutely nothing to change what you do. It can't. Period. Lunar Eclipse can not proc while Solar Eclipse is active and vice-versa. So without early cancelling of your buff, you already HAD a 15 second cooldown on the opposite Eclipse after an Eclipse proc.<br />
<br />
So those who did not either use the addon or manually /cancelaura will see NO CHANGE. Basically the change is that if you cancel the buff early, you still can't proc the other Eclipse until it would've fallen off naturally anyway.<br />
<br />
I think some Boomkins are confused as to what is changing here.</div></div><hr />

NO Change? I usually (95% of situacions) crit with last Elipse and then activate Solar Elipse (+30% dmg to wrath spam until 15 seconds are gone) which is imo a BIG BUFF.....Now they are going to take it from us....damn i hate them.</div></div><hr />

Please, read the change again, and you'll realize he's right. What the change does is this, and only this: When you proc an eclipse, you can't proc the opposite eclipse for 15 seconds. These 15 seconds are NOT counted from the end of the first eclipse, but from the moment it starts. This means, as long as you don't cancel the first eclipse, then your 15 second cooldown ends at exactly the same time as the first eclipse. Hey, presto, you can proc a solar eclipse the moment your lunar eclipse ends, just like before. What you CAN'T do anymore, is cancel the lunar eclipse mid-starfire-cast and thus get a solar eclipse proc out of the starfire that finishes casting before those 15 seconds are up.<br />
<br />
Now, I've never played a balance druid, but it seems to me it should be quite possible to just time the last starfire you cast during a lunar eclipse so that it finishes casting after the lunar eclipse ends, achieving the desired result at the cost of maybe delaying that starfire by a small amount. As far as I can tell, this is what crafty players without the addon have been doing already.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymrohd</div><div class="date">2009-11-24, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Developers want rotations to be intuitive. Whenever something less intuitive creatively uses game mechanics to improve dps they take action to change it. Maybe they are mean and want to nerf your class, maybe they want to dump down the game or maybe they thing that excellent performance should be independent of such behaviour. It doesn't really matter. I will agree that it does dump down the game a bit. But then again I look at simcraft models for PTR data and see almost all classes within 10% of each other in dps (OP ass rogues post poison buff and the three broken dps specs (arms warrior, BM hunter, frost mage) nonwithstanding). Throughout WotLK balance has been great and becoming even better with each patch something that did not happen in classic or even TBC. So if people want to keep whining about 1-2% dps nerfs that still keep them within an acceptable range of every other dpser I call them drama queens. (for god's sake people are whining about a nerf of a set bonus that will be 2 tiers back in ICC. Will 2t8 be relevant in 264 level gear?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then the mix of newer bonuses (and powerfull ones always only with 4pc) + better stats on the next set would always be better than the older tier 4pc bonus.<br />
<br />
I think it would be acceptable to wait until you get like X number of new gear pieces to stop using your old tier 4pc, but NOT changing because a tier (or 2 now!) old 2pc is still gamebreaking no matter what stats you have on your new gear or even the new tier 4pc bonus... stupid design.</div></div><hr />

The logic is &quot;Old set bonuses were too powerful&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kokiron</div><div class="date">2009-11-24, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please, read the change again, and you'll realize he's right. What the change does is this, and only this: When you proc an eclipse, you can't proc the opposite eclipse for 15 seconds. These 15 seconds are NOT counted from the end of the first eclipse, but from the moment it starts. This means, as long as you don't cancel the first eclipse, then your 15 second cooldown ends at exactly the same time as the first eclipse. Hey, presto, you can proc a solar eclipse the moment your lunar eclipse ends, just like before. What you CAN'T do anymore, is cancel the lunar eclipse mid-starfire-cast and thus get a solar eclipse proc out of the starfire that finishes casting before those 15 seconds are up.<br />
<br />
Now, I've never played a balance druid, but it seems to me it should be quite possible to just time the last starfire you cast during a lunar eclipse so that it finishes casting after the lunar eclipse ends, achieving the desired result at the cost of maybe delaying that starfire by a small amount. As far as I can tell, this is what crafty players without the addon have been doing already.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was raging until I read this, now I understand. Thank you :3<br />
<br />
I'd only heard about Wise Eclipse, never used it myself, but I figured it was essentially going to be called an exploit and something done about it.<br />
<br />
Still think we moonkins could use at least a tiny buff, though, with the nerf to the 2p t8. It WAS an OP bonus though, glad I went ahead and had 4 pieces of t9 bought already...<br />
<br />
I think some kind of a cooldown like the current Elemental Mastery would be good for us.</div></div><hr />

Just saying!<br />
<br />
<br />
No, it doesn't. I don't think you know what burst means. In PVE, over a long period, haste gives the same damage as crit. But crit provides those spikes of 2x damage. A person with just haste will have stable, linear damage, but a person with just crit will experience spikey damage i.e. bursts.</div></div><hr />

They fixed the problem with rogues and weapon swapping but buffed the class in place of that change. Now you can go ahead and give me the whole &quot;Pure&gt;Hybrid&quot; speech but shadow priests are getting a whole lot of nice buffs. Elemental Shaman get what looks like a PvP nerf, PvE buff? (correct me if im wrong) Moonkin are getting, more health on treants... they aren't exactly topping charts to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Get over it. According to wowprogress, 4.65% of guilds have killed yogg+1 so &quot;everyone and their mother&quot; does not have an ironbound drake. It's sad that your gameplay experience is boring or fun depending on how many people have the same drake as you.</div></div><hr />

Lol I didn't know whe had such whiners in the community. You have what, two viable damage-producing trees? Caster DPS that bad? Oh noes.<br />

Am I ever glad and pleased that I'm a feral. Cannot believe how much capacity people have to moan about a change that requires you to NOT need an addon to do viable DPS ::)</div></div><hr />

So in your opinion, it's a mount that not everyone who plays should have a right to try and get? =p</div></div><hr />

I have not at any point denied your right to anything. It's great when the playerbase in the first place have these mounts to fight for.<br />

<br />
I don't mind that so many people have the ironbound drake. I have personally earned ~50k gold by selling the drakes so they have been a cash heaven for me. I just think it's very boring seeing them all over the place. Admittedly this is partially because of my realm as 10 guilds here have the drakes (and 3 are just firefighter away) so there isn't much colour outside the raid portals where I spend alot of my time, unless I'm jumping around Ironforge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If boomkins were doing viable dps without the addon, I don't think they'd be complaining. The issue is that this'll put them at the bottom with shadow priests (or below shadow priests, since spriests are getting a buff here) unless some compensating buff is added. You'd be crying if feral just received a giant nerf to drop them below casters. But melee is Blizz's favorite right now so that won't happen.<br />
<br />
You also act like every boomkin can just switch to feral and everything will be okay. Gear may be easier than ever to get, but getting a viable feral set to raid ICC in time for 3.3 starting NOW would be a bit difficult. It also takes like 5 other classes to get all of the boomkin buffs, so it'd suck for raid leaders if all the boomkins suddenly swapped main specs as well.<br />
<br />
Think outside your own spec. I know it may be hard, but non-ferals exist, and they deserve to have a reaction when their spec is changed.</div></div><hr />
