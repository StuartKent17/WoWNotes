Feedback: Epic Battlegrounds<br />
We’re working on some hotfixes to Epic Battlegrounds. These changes are not yet live, but should be ready for the game in the next few days.<br />
<br />
Alterac Valley<br />
<br />
We’re modifying the scaling in the zone to make creatures more difficult for players at high item-levels. Our goal here is to make gameplay feel more similar to the difficulty of Alterac Valley in early Tides of Vengeance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Isle of Conquest<br />
<br />
The health of destructible walls will be increased by 30%. This is intended to offset the power that the docks has given players with recent 8.1.5 improvements.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle for Wintergrasp<br />
<br />
The damage done by the Catapult’s Flame Breath ability will be reduced. We still want Flame Breath to feel scary and powerful, especially against other players, but we feel that current values are too high.<br />
<br />
<br />
We’ve been monitoring Wintergrasp closely, and have been pleased to find that win rates for defense and offense are quite even, with a less-than-5% advantage for defenders. The change above to Catapult could have an impact on that, so we’re holding back on making further changes until we see how this one goes.<br />
<br />
We have some other improvements to Epic Battlegrounds, including a new UI to track Lokholar and Ivus turn-in progress, that we’re bringing to the game in the Rize of Azshara content update.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your continued feedback on Epic Battlegrounds. We really appreciate it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thelxi</div><div class="date">2019-04-11, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm very surprised that this is their fix for AV. NPCs are already tanky and strong, to the point where doing a boss with less than 4 towers/bunkers down is not possible and galv/balinda being skipped 100% of the time already. The real problem in AV as far as I can tell is that the current meta of defending IB and SH and slowly pushing through is heavily in favor of the Horde, since IB is much easier to defend not only because of tower vs. bunker layout, but because of the chokepoints and high ground. If they keep buffing NPCs, which in this case might be more the case of just keeping things as they are in anticipation of average player ilvl inflation, Horde will just cling on to their map advantage. This really fixes nothing. <br />
<br />
The IoC changes don't really have an impact one way or the other, other than making docks even riskier because glaives would have to stay alive longer. If anything this makes hangar even better and even more consistent. The turret on siege will still 2 shot entire raid groups in a few seconds and demos will still be very effective vs. players. <br />
<br />
The WG changes I personally find very sad. Catas being so strong allowed players like myself to have an enormous impact on the BG, sometimes getting 50+ killing blows and really hard-carrying the match. Yes Catas are absolutely OP, but simply nerfing them will get ahead of players actually realizing how dangerous they are in melee range and how squishy and rootable the vehicles are. Currently just 2 good dps can absolutely 2v1 a single cata without dying as long as they properly kite and use cc and defensive cooldowns. A single person that knows what they are doing will lose the 1v1 against a cata, but at the very least take most of its health down with him. I don't like this change and I wish Blizzard would give the community a chance to learn how to deal with catas before taking away the high risk and high reward potential of catas. Depending on how big this nerf is, demos might just be the best vehicle now, just sitting at 100 yards shooting at groups of people, vehicles and of course walls. <br />
<br />
I wish they were more transparent about winrates across all the epic BGs too btw, this is only half the story they are telling here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly what I thought.<br />
The main reason why I don't play epic bis anymore are the russian &quot;premade&quot; groups in the EU. I don't have any issues with being slaughtered ingame if the enemy team pushes towards victory in a fast and efficient way. But this completely reactive and defensive play just drives me mad. Sometimes I just want some AV nostalgia and end up in a 1hour IoC where nobody in my team even wants to fight anymore.<br />
<br />
Regarding Wintergrasp: It was a pure pain during Wotlk already. Bringing this one back is another example for analysing data in a wrong way. The only cause of Wintergrasp was to unlock the bosses afterwards. This is why everybody participated because there was just free loot including gladiator gear waiting for the players. <br />
<br />
Another reason for me personally is the ongoing balancing / fixing of the epic bgs. It seems that everbody has a different state of knowledge what does work to win and what does not.</div></div><hr />

Then we join it and it's like the name Epic is ironic, it's mind numbing.<br />
<br />
People don't like doing these. <br />
They are:<br />
1. Not effective - the time it takes vs conquest points earned<br />
2. Has way too long of a queue time<br />
3. They are simply not FUN<br />
<br />
Your maps can have a less than 5% difference in win ratio on defence vs. attack all they want. <br />
<br />
Balanced maps don't automatically make them fun.<br />
Just like balanced classes does not automatically make them fun. It actually makes them incredibly boring.</div></div><hr />

I still get wrecked on any of my characters if I try to fight 2 graveyard guards at once. They hit for 50k a swing at 400 ilvl. Riding by iceblood tower and getting hit by the archers takes half my hp before I'm out of range. Is it different on the horde side since the alliance towers are set up so you can only be hit by 1 or 2 archers at once (except in dun baldar when in range of 2 towers)? You get hit by 3 horde ones at a time regularly and 5 or 6 in the horde base.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Has way too long of a queue time<br />
<br />
<br />
This is only a horde problem (or maybe EU). Alliance Epic bg queues in the US are 2-3 minutes except maybe really early morning when you might get a 10 minute queue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just want to point out this part specifically real fast.<br />
<br />
Don't you think that the fact that two bosses that use to be required kills had fallen into becoming 100% skipped? That does not seem like a design issue to you at all from lack of BG maintenance? If anything, this change should make them out to be more valued targets to hit. Why is it strange to think that Blizzard wants players to actually care about objectives like Galvanger and Balinda?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Galvanger and Balinda are skipped because they're too strong already and their importance decreased because of the switch to 700 resources instead of 600. They're still usually killed in resource win games, but other than that there's no point in wasting so much time on them to try to kill them. It's too easy to wipe anything but a full raid on them with a minimal amount of resistance.</div></div><hr />

Imagine 80 people in one spot in a BFA quality area with constant combat going on. It would either lag or be nigh unplayable. And it already lags admittedly on rare occasion in IOC when it gets a bit intense.<br />

<br />
I note you said 'rarely' and not 'never.' So at max settings you do encounter the brief bit of lag - when the environments are at Vanilla-level design.<br />
<br />
Do you really think they won't suddenly start lagging a lot when you update things to use models that have a hundred times the polygons?</div></div><hr />
