Over the course of WoW’s nearly 10-year history, raiding has probably undergone more iteration and change than any other game system. To put the upcoming Warlords of Draenor raid changes into proper context, this three-part blog series will attempt to retrace the twists and turns of our raid design philosophy from Molten Core through Siege of Orgrimmar.<br />
<br />
In this final entry, Lead Game Designer Ion “Watcher” Hazzikostas wraps things up by taking a look at the raiding philosophy and design changes coming in Warlords of Draenor (Warlords).<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor (2014)<br />
<br />
As we announced at BlizzCon, we’re excited about the opportunity to extend our Flexible Raid tech to address some of the long-standing problems we’ve been grappling with as a design team for over 5 years now. Here’s a quick breakdown of how the new system works: We’re relabeling Flexible Raid mode Normal, and it will serve as the new baseline point of entry to organized raiding. We’re also combining the current 10-player and 25-player Normal modes into a single Heroic difficulty. Finally, we’re consolidating 10-player and 25-player Heroic into a new fixed-size 20-player Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
This system will allow the vast majority of players to raid with a wide variety of possible raid sizes, and reap the benefits of that structure. One of the major upsides of a 13-player raid is that you don’t have to worry about canceling if one or two people aren’t able to make it; you also don’t have to worry about asking someone to sit out if everyone shows up. This, in turn, means that raiding in an organized group is possible without the same feeling of obligation, and that such groups will be much more resilient in practice.<br />
<br />
While we’ve made significant strides in tuning 10-player and 25-player Normal modes to be comparable in difficulty over the course of Mists of Pandaria (Mists), precise 10 vs. 25 Heroic tuning has continued to be a major challenge, especially on important fights such as Lei Shen (easier with 10) and Garrosh (easier with 25). Consolidating to a single raid size for Mythic will allow us to focus on delivering the best possible experience for our competitive hardcore raiders, while the flexible nature of Normal and Heroic mode provides an avenue for smaller groups to organically grow and continue raiding if they want to give Mythic a try.<br />
<br />
Group Finder<br />
Another central innovation in Warlords is our Group Finder feature, which will allow players to easily form and search for raid groups (among other activities) with players from their entire region. While this series of blogs has mostly focused on pre-existing social structures, pick-up groups continue to be tremendously important. Chance meetings in such groups have formed the basis for many a friendship, and recurring weekly pickup groups have given rise to more than a few guilds over the years. For players who want to take the next step beyond Raid Finder, or who want to find a weekend run for their alt, or who just need a last-minute tenth member for their raid, Group Finder will make that process easier than ever before.<br />
<br />
Raid Finder<br />
Raid Finder still has an important place within the new Warlords raid structure. Many players cannot or simply do not want to commit to a fixed group. And no matter how convenient we make organized raiding through Group Finder, it’ll never be something you can jump in and do for 45 minutes during your downtime on a busy day, the way you might do a Raid Finder wing.<br />
<br />
However, we’ve also learned other lessons from our experience with Raid Finder over the past two and a half years. Raiding a single zone with a guild or group of friends can stay engaging for months, and one of the core reasons for that is the pacing of progression through a zone. A raid group might start out learning a new boss or two each week; that pace slows as the raid reaches the later bosses near the end of a zone, and more time each week is spent re-clearing “farm content” to gear up further. This keeps the experience varied, and even if you don’t get the specific loot you were hoping for in a given week, you’re seeing your friends and guildmates progress and get stronger, and you’re feeling the impact of those upgrades as you kill bosses faster and faster.<br />
<br />
Raid Finder offers none of that. Your ninth clear of the Underhold section of Siege of Orgrimmar is likely no faster than your second (and might even be slower); you aren’t experiencing anything new or different. So how can we make Raid Finder a more compelling and enjoyable experience? A decent first step is to make it significantly more generous than it has been in the past, nearly doubling the rate of reward to better match the overall pacing of the content.<br />
<br />
Our intent is for Raid Finder to allow players to experience our raid content, see the conclusion of major storylines, and witness the epic environments that our artists create without needing to commit to an organized raid group. We’d like to focus on that purity of purpose, and minimize the elements that have made guild raiders feel like they needed to do Raid Finder each week as part of their core progression. Accordingly, while loot will be awarded more frequently, Raid Finder in Warlords will have different loot tables than the Normal, Heroic, or Mythic versions of the raids, along with different item art. The gear will fall in between dungeon loot and Normal mode raid loot in terms of power, as it does today, but without the set bonuses and specific trinkets that tend to make raiders feel like they need to run Raid Finder alongside their weekly guild raids today.<br />
<br />
After a player gets quickly geared up through Raid Finder and starts thinking about venturing into Normal mode for better rewards, their Raid Finder loot and combat experience should prepare them to take that next step—and Group Finder will make the process easier than ever before.<br />
<br />
Raid Lockouts<br />
In Warlords, each raid difficulty will have its own weekly lockout. We gave careful consideration to how the lockout system should work, and which difficulties (if any) would share lockouts. Having seen how Flex works today, it’s clear there are many benefits to having our raid difficulties on separate lockouts: Players might currently raid Normal or Heroic Siege of Orgrimmar with their guilds on a set schedule, but then join real-life friends on another server for weekend Flex runs and a chance to grab some off-spec loot. Players who are regularly clearing Normal, let alone Heroic, Siege of Orgrimmar quickly find that they don’t need much main-spec loot from Flex. Most players who are doing Siege in multiple difficulties each week are doing so with different social groups, and we’d like to preserve players’ freedom to do so.<br />
<br />
As for Heroic and Mythic, having those difficulties share a lockout would present a number of technical as well as logistical challenges: Heroic is a flexible-size loot-based lockout; Mythic is a fixed-size boss-based lockout, limited to a single realm, with a static ID. The two simply aren’t congruent. Having these on a separate lockout also simplifies some things for high-end guilds that are trying to manage progress on a limited schedule, and currently have to carefully budget enough time at the end of each week to re-kill remaining bosses on Normal difficulty for loot. In Warlords, those groups will be able to frontload their farming for the week and then work on Mythic progression for the rest of the week without worry.<br />
<br />
Reflecting on the “Trial of the Crusader problem” in Patch 3.2, much of the issue there stemmed from the way Emblems worked at the time. Badges obtained from raid bosses and dungeons were necessary just to buy set pieces, and so guilds felt obligated to keep clearing something like 10-player Normal Trial of the Crusader, even if they needed none of the loot, just for the extra Emblems. In Warlords, we are scaling back Valor, along with the incentive to cap Valor weekly. Less linear layouts and shortcuts that allow experienced groups to skip to certain bosses should let raiders target the specific content that interests them. In general, we’re erring on the side of giving players choice and freedom, and we feel that our character progression systems are better structured now and will not encourage excessive repetition of the same content.<br />
<br />
Raiding Draenor<br />
The raiding system we’re introducing in Warlords draws upon ten years of experience and all of the lessons we’ve learned along the way. We feel this system will provide the best possible raid experience to as many players as possible, regardless of their play style, and we’re excited for you all to try it. We’ll be paying close attention to your constructive feedback, and watching carefully once raid testing begins in our upcoming beta.</div></div><hr />

How is this the best watercooler ever?, i am confused it's a good one but they have had a few that was way superior to this one ;)<br />
<br />
And yeah it's cool looking back, i want to know about how classes was since vanilla and forward, would be interesting seeing how classes have developed from unique to almost the same across the line. (no sarcasm i am genuinely interested).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chib</div><div class="date">2014-04-30, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a chuckle to myself here after that, I've got experience of all end of this game and while people complain that its far to easy now it keeps the games population large and servers healthy. Damaging LFR by curtailing its loot tables, increasing the drop rate and more importantly giving what people will consider inferior artwork on the sets. We will see more people finish the content faster and have no interest in staying for the long haul.<br />
<br />
Like most above me I might have taken that attitude in my AQ 40 or Naxx 40 days but that's the past and that horse long bolted when Pots and elixirs were nerfed and 25 man raids came in BC. Its a shame as I think its not going to do good and panders to a small group of vocal users and not the masses who pay the bulk of the charges for the game.<br />
<br />
Such a shame.</div></div><hr />

That would mean a HUGE gap between heroic dungeons and flex ilvl for trinkets. As much as i hate running RF its needed for that gap that was there in the past. The problem will probably fix it self when new raid tiers come out, but for the first 5 months of wod it will be a bitch closing that ilvl gap for trinkets.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yakrion</div><div class="date">2014-04-30, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems like they should have left tier in LFR just without the set bonuses. LFR Raiders get to keep their visuals while more advanced raiders don't feel forced to chase the tier piece that just won't drop for them. I don't see the point of removing the tier visuals from them unless it's to try to incentivize more LFR raiders to move on to flex. Which I do approve of.<br />
<br />
I'm curious to see if this will mean LFR has no trinkets at all or just more simplified trinkets that are less important (like the timeless isle ones).</div></div><hr />

<br />
No offense, but LFR is just to &quot;SEE&quot; the content, its not even remotely close to a real-life raid environment. You are doing &lt;50% of the normal work and expecting all the glory of doing 100% of the content/work? C'mon man.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vongimi</div><div class="date">2014-04-30, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good stuff, but I don't like how LFR loot &quot;will fall in between dungeon loot and normal mode raid loot.&quot; I was hoping they were going to remove LFR from the progression path COMPLETELY by making it drop loot on par with dungeon loot.

<br />
It will essentially be progression for the first week or so, and than a catch-up for alts. With no set bonuses or trinkets, sounds like you could pretty easily skip it. Plus challenge modes (and maybe heroic scenarios? Havent heard anything about those) will drop equivalent gear. Even if you do end up running it for gear, with double the chance of loot drops you won't run it for long. Its pretty well removed from the progression path, you might &quot;need&quot; to run it for a week or two it looks like, but after that you will never have to run it again for the rest of the expansion (except as a catch-up for alts).<br />

<br />
Or they could get that half to try something a bit harder. IMO it would be a victory if 25% stopped and 25% started doing normals (flex now).</div></div><hr />

Silliness. Not only will top guilds be farming both flex difficulties with alts and funneling tier sets and trinkets to mains, but what Blizzard doesn't realize is that killing bosses on easier difficulties really destroys the feeling of accomplishment for a first kill. With 20 man being a singular hardest difficulty, there was no need to have other raids available if this is your chosen path. Such a huge mistake in my opinion, but we shall see.</div></div><hr />

With 20 man being a singular hardest difficulty, there was no need to have other raids available if this is your chosen path. Such a huge mistake in my opinion, but we shall see.<br />

i so agree. This is why i quit in mop, this is why i am not coming back to wod. Blizzard makes me raiding mindlessly and excessively. Not gonna happen.</div></div><hr />

With no set bonuses or trinkets, sounds like you could pretty easily skip it. Plus challenge modes (and maybe heroic scenarios? Havent heard anything about those) will drop equivalent gear. Even if you do end up running it for gear, with double the chance of loot drops you won't run it for long. Its pretty well removed from the progression path, you might &quot;need&quot; to run it for a week or two it looks like, but after that you will never have to run it again for the rest of the expansion (except as a catch-up for alts).<br />
<br />
True, true. They've addressed the reluctance of many players to run LFR by making it much less necessary across the board for progression, so maybe running it for alt-gearing once or twice won't be so bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as I'm aware, there is no confirmation about heroic dungeon loot being anywhere close to LFR loot in terms of how good it is.<br />
<br />
Watcher actually just tweeted that LFR loot will be better than heroic dungeon loot (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/statuses/461557185781067777).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NickCageFanatic</div><div class="date">2014-04-30, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, if someone has enough time to do LFR, they have enough time to find a group for flex. I've sat in some pretty long LFR queue times, or sitting around waiting on this or that.<br />
<br />
Just because someone had the time to sit in queue for an hour and spend 45 minutes running SoO on Monday at 7:00pm - 9:00pm doesn't mean they are going to do the same thing at the same time next Monday, flex groups are set up by PuGs that typically require above and beyond the gear actually required to clear Flex. <br />
<br />
So regardless as to whether you think people that run LFR can do Flex, there are other issues with Flex that prevent people with a sporatic game time schedule from moving up to that level.</div></div><hr />

This won't be the case. In the beginning of the xpac, I am pretty sure (not 100% certain) that normal (todays flex) will be released over time, like it was in 5.4. So, top guild would have no need to do flex when it is out because they would already have gear from doing Heroic (since the entire first raid will be out a week after the release of the expansion) and some Mythic pieces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it is between NORMAL dungeon loot and normal raiding. Raiders will be able to bypass LFR by doing HEROIC dungeons, which will have similar ilvls to LFR and you can spam them the first week or two of the expansion, whereas LFR will be delayed and open up a wing a time.<br />
<br />
First week for raiders<br />
Level to 100, run some normal dungeons, SPAM heroic dungeons... start raiding second week and maybe keep spamming heroic dungeons for some upgrades. You will have 2, or maybe 3 weeks of being able to run heroic dungeons for gear before the first wing of LFR even opens.</div></div><hr />

I do really like that Flex mode raiding is being implemented into normal mode raiding. So now Normal and Heroic modes support 10-25 players based on whoever you have online.

Dont get me wrong i love wow. despite its problems its still one of the best MMO's out there. WoW has its issues of course. but the biggest issue is actually the company that runs it. they are bound and determined that they are going to tell you how to play the game. I am not saying its the best. but LFR has become the most popular(attendance) form of raiding in the game as per blizzard statement. Taking away tier gear and trinkets will not force LFR players to find flex and normal raids, it will simply make them quit as you take even more options away from them. this has been proven time and time again you can not force your player base to do what you want..they will play the way they want to play or leave when they cant.<br />
<br />
I simply refer you to 3 releases of your major games and the uproar of dissatisfied customers. CATA, Pandaria, Diablo 3, success is not defined just by the amount of units you sell, but by the amount of customers you retain, the long term loyalty they bring to you. you have succeeded at the first and are loosing the battle on the 2nd and 3rd. Somewhere along the line you forgot who you are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is just false. LFR is very easy... it can, and is easily cleared by ´bad´ players in bad gear. You know what makes LFR suck? raiders who are toxic. besides Galaron for 2 weeks, I never was in a hopeless LFR. Wiped plenty, wiped twice a few times, but never wiped so often that I quit. But you know.. 100% of the toxic players I´ve encountered in LFR were normal raiders.<br />
<br />
The target audience for LFR doesn´t care if they wipe, they don´t care if it takes 45 minutes or 55 minutes, or that is someone doesn´t have their gear gemmed perfectly for their spec. What makes LFR suck has always been the toxic players, not someone doing 20% less dps than other people.</div></div><hr />

Considering tanks are the limiting factor on most LFR groups filling up and that you'll still need two to continue most times, I don't see how flexing down to 10 will help. Let alone they are reducing the pool of tanks to LFR-only players who, as we already know, make excellent tanks... Not to mention the lower the group size goes, the more detrimental having a few AFK or 100 dps (after squish) players becomes.</div></div><hr />

I know plenty of raiders that do LFR without complaint. These are the people that understand the point of what gear progression is. Heck, even if they don't need gear from LFR, they still do LFR.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because they enjoy it. They don't treat it like a chore. Maybe if you didn't look at it as a &quot;chore&quot; you'd feel differently.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Revak</div><div class="date">2014-04-30, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My take:<br />
<br />
I really do not like having to do LFR at the moment. It really is no fun. I do it for set bonuses, trinkets, and certain transmog color gear or weapons (as well as required drops for the legendary quest line). <br />
<br />
I do not think LFR should have better gear than heroic dungeons. If they were not going to give tier set bonuses they should make the gear look A LOT better than they have b/c it is ugly. Queue times are going to skyrocket and those people he refers to only wanting to raid 45 minutes or so at a time (which is unrealistic now as queues are that long just to get in) are now going to spend hours just for each wing of LFR. No tier sets, trinkets, tier bonuses, and ugly art are going to be the downfall of LFR. A lot of people who go nowadays do not need it but do it for those sets/bonuses, transmog, and valor. Less players, lower geared players, and less skilled players are going to make each wing of LFR take longer to complete. Unfortunately I think that WoW is going to lose a lot of players b/c of this. No matter the what peoples' opinions are on their skill or whatnot, while this might be good for &quot;real raiding&quot; (and I'm a vanilla player) this will not be good for the subs in WoW.<br />
<br />
All the other raid stuff sounds pretty good. Glad we can just go with who we have on a raid night and not have to worry about odd numbers online. We no longer raid hard core 4 nights a week like we did in vanilla, TBC, and Wrath so these changes are welcome as a lot of our guildies, including myself, have kids and are a lot older nowadays and just want to raid when our friends can and do it together.</div></div><hr />

Grown ass men and women who started playing this game 10 years ago, demands playing it today. They want the same stuff, but now many of them want it in a easier &amp; less time consuming way.<br />
<br />
Listen. Im 27 years old. I started playing this game 10 years ago. I was 17, not a worry in sight. I could play the game so much over the years, I put in the job to get alot of gear/achivs/titles etc. Can I do that now? 10 years later? No, I cant. Do I still play the game? Yes I do, but I also realised that I cant expect the same thing from the game anymore when I dont have the chance to put the time and effort into it. <br />
<br />
This game needs some kind of standards. Right now there is no god damn standard for anything. Queue lfr, go afk mode, get loot, leave. Those poor souls in LFR trying to make something out of it is always left out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next thing: LFR. This is what LFR should have been from the start. People get to SEE the content. The raid, bosses and maybe finish quest chains that goes into the raid. If those people who ONLY do LFR and nothing more of raiding, why does it matter that some gear is left out? This is your content, this is what you do. It wont take you more time. There is no more progression for you. LFR loot is the top. Im glad they are removing tier and trinkets from LFR loot table. Say what you want, but there is enough tier bonuses &amp; trinkets that was well worth getting, even LFR versions.<br />
<br />
Last note: I might not be able to do alot of raiding besides flex normal. Maybe I just gotta stick to LFR. Im cool with that. Its not the games fault. As wow has, I have grown up. I have changed, my life has changed. That does not mean a fantastic game like wow should to. Those younger then me should also experience the epic journeys to be had in this game. Not some halfassed lfr run.</div></div><hr />

Just tweeted by Watcher (over several tweets):<br />
- LfR itemlevel is between heroic 5-mans and normal raids, since LfR and 5-mans being equal would kill LfR, and Blizzard doesn't want that :P<br />
- This is offset by LfR having a weekly lockout while 5-mans have a daily one, also 5-mans are open on day 1<br />
- 5-man heroic gear is good enough for starting organized raiding, so you can skip LfR<br />
- There will be other sources of catch-up gear, crafting, garrisons, &quot;Outdoor objectives&quot; (Whatever those are :P )<br />
<br />
Nothing about the trinkets yet though, but since Watcher also said LfR is its own progression path, i presume some lesser trinkets (Compared to normal+) will drop there...</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the positive, Flex being available via raid finder offers solo raiders or players in a guild that doesn't raid who want more challenge an alternative to LFR. On the negative, I can't run LFR to try and fill some loot gaps (like trinkets or tier pieces to complete a bonus that refuse to drop in flex), because joining a Flex, now Normal, outside of my raid nights locks me out. <br />
<br />
What I'm not clear on is that if now Flex becomes Normal, Normal becomes Heroic and Heroic becomes Mythic, what's the difficulty breakdown? Is the WoD Heroic the same difficulty as MoP Normal? Does a guild have to clear the new Normal (old Flex) to do Heroic (old Normal)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The competition amongst ourselves is extremely toxic, unnecessary, and downright detrimental to the game. I don't care about DPS or proper specs, thus the meta game is lost on me now. I have no addons whatsoever. I play with the standard UI and haven't even bothered to macro a fucking thing.<br />
<br />
When you get to my point in the play the game, one might ask, why still play? I play because I enjoy the content, the environments, the lore, from when I played WC as a child. That is Warcraft 1. I want to see the story played out, and I come back into the game just to see what it's like.<br />
<br />
All this shit about no flying and nerfed LFR content is nothing but bullshit to me. Even though it affects me, it doesn't change the way and will I play.

Like Crusader said, I'm old now (31) and I can't devote time to a set raiding schedule. Not with a 6 and 4 year old.

Oqueue and OpenRaid are the tools I'd used to do a smattering of flex raids in MoP. I'm hoping this is implemented fully into the WoW UI. Make it work, Blizzard. My raiding days depend on it.</div></div><hr />

Grown ass men and women who started playing this game 10 years ago, demands playing it today. They want the same stuff, but now many of them want it in a easier &amp; less time consuming way.<br />
<br />
Listen. Im 27 years old. I started playing this game 10 years ago. I was 17, not a worry in sight. I could play the game so much over the years, I put in the job to get alot of gear/achivs/titles etc. Can I do that now? 10 years later? No, I cant. Do I still play the game? Yes I do, but I also realised that I cant expect the same thing from the game anymore when I dont have the chance to put the time and effort into it. <br />
<br />
This game needs some kind of standards. Right now there is no god damn standard for anything. Queue lfr, go afk mode, get loot, leave. Those poor souls in LFR trying to make something out of it is always left out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Next thing: LFR. This is what LFR should have been from the start. People get to SEE the content. The raid, bosses and maybe finish quest chains that goes into the raid. If those people who ONLY do LFR and nothing more of raiding, why does it matter that some gear is left out? This is your content, this is what you do. It wont take you more time. There is no more progression for you. LFR loot is the top. Im glad they are removing tier and trinkets from LFR loot table. Say what you want, but there is enough tier bonuses &amp; trinkets that was well worth getting, even LFR versions.<br />
<br />
Last note: I might not be able to do alot of raiding besides flex normal. Maybe I just gotta stick to LFR. Im cool with that. Its not the games fault. As wow has, I have grown up. I have changed, my life has changed. That does not mean a fantastic game like wow should to. Those younger then me should also experience the epic journeys to be had in this game. Not some halfassed lfr run.<br />
<br />
same argument can be used against you. why are you doing normal or heroic. since you are not going to get beyond those, the gear obviously has no use to you so why are you doing it? the answer is the same for you as it is them. PERSONAL PROGRESSION. YOU are not the deciding factor on how far you progress in the game. YOUR RAID TEAM is only as good as its weakest members which means if your team cant get past which ever boss.. that's it.. you wont go any further than the other 9 players will take you. not every guild is a server top 3 or world top 10 as such most never even see the end bosses in a Raid Environment except in LFR.<br />
<br />
The gear is already lower ILvl, its already recolored. and it has its own set of aggravation from afk/griefers/unprepared players. removing tier and trinkets does nothing to anyone but punish LFR players for being LFR players. someone used an argument earlier that it forces top end guilds to farm the lower teirs.. well.. at least you have that option LFR players don't have the option of farming multiple tiers as guess what.. they cant, don't want, or refuse to participate in higher tiers for what ever their reasons are.<br />

I still don't get why they bother with the change. If anything, they should remove tier pieces from world bosses since those take way less effort to down and are far easier than LFR. Oh well, looks like LFR reall won't change much except I'll get loot faster. Yay!</div></div><hr />

Hopefully the flex mode in WoD will be well buildt in. Though, Blizzard has done some poor attempts at those earlier..<br />

Atleast in this group tool people will be able to search for other like minded people and create a raid on theyre own. Take ownership in the raid. Care for who joins and want people to do some effort. In LFR you get tossed at 24 other random people with 12983712 reasons not to perform.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but LFR raiding is not raiding. It does not require coordination and it doesn't not require knowledge of how fights work. It is not and should not be a form of end game progression. It should be solely for people who only want to see the content but don't want a challenge. Like reading a book. Reading is not challenging (well, that may be a stretch...) and it tells you the story.<br />
<br />
Raiding is about coordination and teamwork AND being a part of the story. That's not LFR.<br />
<br />
Normal raids should be the new standard for raiding. I just hope it comes with a smidgeon more challenge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea me too :( they said that heroic dungeons will gear up for normal raid and normal will gear up for LFR...this is a hit to the small friend groups that like dungeons but not willing to do raiding.

I'm fine with LFR not carrying Tier gear or even trinkets so long as:<br />
<br />
a. Gearing up from LFR Patch1 is sufficient for participation in LFR Patch2.<br />
<br />
b. The Warlordly Epic (or whatever they call it) achievement can be achieved through LFR. Whether that means they provide inferior but high enough iLvl trinkets through LFR or make the trinkets accessible through other means (crafting, rep, anything but PVP!), I don't really care but LFR should gear in the same way as &quot;normal&quot; raiding... just on a lower iLevel.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also agree with Potassiumgluconate, if Blizz waters down LFR too much they are definitely going to see a decline in raiding numbers because there is no way that Flex numbers are close to the jump in raiders they saw with the introduction of LFR.<br />
<br />
The fact is that WoW is an old game and while the subscriber base is incredible and I still love the game, the changes they have made to the raiding models over the years are not solely in reaction to the mistakes that they have made, they are also in reaction to the changing landscape of the player base. More and more people are playing WoW less and less frequently, often even canceling and re-subbing around their life schedules. LFR was introduced because of this and the fact that WoW is becoming an increasingly less social game. <br />
<br />
It is not becoming an antisocial game but guilds have more members now because players want the perks and to avoid invite spam than because they want to be a part of the guild. Group Finder for raids in WoD is because fewer and fewer guilds can field a full team. <br />
<br />
TL;DR: LFR is a significant chunk of the raiding player base today and if Blizz dilutes the value of playing at that level too much to appease the &quot;LFR dimishes my accomplishment&quot; crowd, they're going to lose those players, not see them jump to Flex/Normal.</div></div><hr />

There will be a new raid browser for Normal raids and you'll be able to complete them with coordination and teamwork. If you actually attempted to not be terrible in LFR, then you won't be doing LFR anymore...you'll be in Normal raids. That's the whole point. They aren't taking away your preferred raid style, they're moving it into a different tier.<br />
<br />
And hopefully, it's a better one. I am quite excited for it.</div></div><hr />

Today's environment with OQue, Open Raid, and probably the in-game interface already changes how people raid. Even if I wanted Tier stuff from LFR, I still don't have any motivation or desire to do it, because I can raid Flex at my own schedule whenever I want because of any of the three mentioned tools. (Well, maybe not the in-game interface, since I've never even looked at it)<br />

That's exactly what they want. For you to WANT to do Normal and Mythic if you want the challenge/better looking gear. LFR was always meant to be a way for people to experience the content and learn the very basics. Not a way to look cool or take it to the next level.

The only actual issues I see if the difficulty of organizing a 20 man mythic team and how the flex system will change the commitment level of regular raiders. <br />
But seriously, being sad that LFR will not have tier is like being sad that they forgot to put mustard on your shit sandwich. All I can see here is &quot;hallelujah, I only have to run LFR once or twice&quot;. <br />
<br />
The good news is:<br />
Normal/Heroic guild raids don't have to bench people because they are full<br />
Teams can now build around a larger core of players so that if one can't make it you don't have to pug<br />
If you do want to pug you don't have to post &quot;LF SoO, 556 Boomkin at Malk&quot; because there will be tools to help find groups and it doesn't matter what boss you're loot saved at<br />
If you are farming LFR you'll be done three times as fast, twice because of the double loot chance and one more time faster because you won't be hunting for tier tokens<br />
Saving a mythic lockout will be much easier as it doesn't mean loosing out on farming heroic<br />
<br />
The downsides:<br />
20 man teams are harder to manage and still have the same problems of set size we experience today<br />
With the flex system being at heroic level people will feel less need to commitment to their team and holding together a team after you stop needing gear will be more difficult. Right? If I only need gear from wing 3 and 4 of SoO (for example) and my team raids twice per week why not just stop coming to day one and only show up for day two? We might end up in the trap of forever gearing up new people because more geared people see less reason come to both nights. This kind of inconsistency could be hard on the group and make regular teams less regular. <br />
The fellow who thinks his LFR tier makes him badass will have to put on big-boy pants and go do some normal raiding. This will make him sad and he and millions others will unsubscribe because blizz doesn't care about what players think. This sad person really has no business raiding anyway and I for one will not miss him/her.</div></div><hr />

How does someone with no Add-ons accomplish method? Pugging is straight up dead. The days of pugging are gone. I refuse to use add-ons, I'm shit out of luck?<br />
<br />
You rely on tools not even offered by Blizzard to accomplish something, speaks a lot about the community and the company producing the content.</div></div><hr />

We will see more people finish the content faster and have no interest in staying for the long haul.<br />
<br />
LFR didn't exist during WoW's highest subscription periods and people were still staying &quot;for the long haul&quot;. Adding LFR to the game was good, but it was poorly implemented. Blizzard is correcting that.<br />
<br />
<br />
No Tier in LFR confirmed.<br />
<br />
And like that, Blizzard will spend the rest of the expansion scratching their heads wondering why half the population stopped raiding.<br />
Blizzard already had this problem when less than 1% of their playerbase was actually raiding &quot;current&quot; content during the first 2 iterations of the game. Not gonna pull up numbers for AQ40, Naxx40, TK, BT, MH, SWP but almost no one except the most hardcore or brute-force guilds saw those places when they were introduced.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard will be OK with their decision so long as people keep seeing content (in what ever tier they can).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spaceboytg</div><div class="date">2014-04-30, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having already moved on from WoW due to many of the decisions being made for WoD (including, now, this one) I do think this is a good idea overall. WoW needs to stop trying to hold onto the 'crown' of MMO's, that whole &quot;we have X subs more than anyone else!&quot;, and decide what game it wants to be. Clearly, the new philosophy is that it wants to be a game aimed at the 5% while still retaining just enough of the remainder to remain viable. To do that, the company has to be willing to accept that they are going to shed a tremendous amount of subs (which was going to happen over time no matter what they did) very quickly but be left with a more stable playerbase that will go along with whatever they decide simply because those players cannot fathom playing anything else ;)<br />
<br />
WoW is going to shed subs, the raiding minority is going to be happy with the game that's leftover (now that there is realm mergers to ensure population minimums), and the MMO genre overall is going to be better off with the influx of former WoW players trying something new and discovering all the great games that are out there ... which will lead to more innovation in the genre.<br />
<br />
I'm glad Blizzard has decided they don't want me playing their game anymore :) The sooner others realize it's true for them as well, the better for them and the game.</div></div><hr />

And yes, with LFR now being available in flex-style 10-25 players, those queue wait times are sure to skyrocket, because, um, backwards logic, I guess.

Until this day, I was always agree with changes that blizzard made and I never complained about one. But this time, as a LFR player ( and i'm not shy to say it ) I'm not really sure that I will buy WOD.<br />
<br />
This is straight up not true. People don't do LFR because they are bored. If this was the only reason to do LFR, most people wouldn't bother. The fact is that RNG is RNG and that a lot of the times trinkets and tier sets from lfr are better than your previous tier's heroic trinket. Example: Amplification trinket in SoO. WAY BETTER than heroic thunderforged trinkets from ToT. Or how about UVLS from previous tier? What if you are not getting it in your normal runs? LFR trinket may have lower rppm, but it still gives 100% crit which allows to do some insane stuff. I personally play a holy paladin and I could not get horridon's freaking trinket last tier. It just never dropped for me. So I ended up running with LFR version of it for the heroic progression. How does that make sense?</div></div><hr />

WoW needs to stop trying to hold onto the 'crown' of MMO's, that whole &quot;we have X subs more than anyone else!&quot;, and decide what game it wants to be. Clearly, the new philosophy is that it wants to be a game aimed at the 5% while still retaining just enough of the remainder to remain viable. To do that, the company has to be willing to accept that they are going to shed a tremendous amount of subs (which was going to happen over time no matter what they did) very quickly but be left with a more stable playerbase that will go along with whatever they decide simply because those players cannot fathom playing anything else ;)<br />
<br />
WoW is going to shed subs, the raiding minority is going to be happy with the game that's leftover (now that there is realm mergers to ensure population minimums), and the MMO genre overall is going to be better off with the influx of former WoW players trying something new and discovering all the great games that are out there ... which will lead to more innovation in the genre.<br />
<br />
I'm glad Blizzard has decided they don't want me playing their game anymore :) The sooner others realize it's true for them as well, the better for them and the game.<br />
<br />
New and unique post. Posts like this never happend during classic, bc, wotlk, cata. Know that this game grew larger and larger long before the idea of LFR was put out. I cant fathom how a LFR change is going to decrease insane sub numbers. LFR is still there for people to see the content.<br />
<br />
and what? the 5%? So right now, there is only 5% of the playerbase using Flex raiding for SoO? If so, Blizzard would probably never go on with that feature.<br />
<br />
As you actually mentioned, Blizzard gotta decide where they want the game to be. There needs to be some god damn standards in this. Its a MMORPG. If you cant devote time and effort, well then you cant do it all.<br />
<br />
I refuse to believe that there are millions of players out there who are happy with current &quot;raiding&quot; situation. Queue up, wait 50 minutes, join raid with 24 different kind of people, some in wrong spec(and wont change), some afk, some just rude and so on. <br />
<br />
If there are millions of people that love current LFR, then there are so many out there with little to no standard &amp; demand towards Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

That's my only remaining concern about LfR: will LfR using flex-technology compensate for fewer people queueing up for it?</div></div><hr />

Gee aren't you a special snowflake wannabe. You just proved to everybody that you don't care about &quot;seeing the content&quot;, you just care about getting epics for zero effort. Good on you - do you expect A grades in school for no work, too? And you're quitting just because of a change to the raid scenery? So are you a casual or not? Obviously someone who laments over a change to LFR can't be a serious player, thereby we can deduce you have lots of other stuff you can do in game. <br />
<br />
Frankly your attitude is disgusting. You'd have everyone else's content watered down just because you're too lazy to play the game as intended. The fewer people like you this game has, the better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think the queue times will be awful in the weeks the wings open. People will queue up, get in, complete it while being showered with awful gear, then never go back. Maybe 3-4 run tops to get everything you need. A month after a wing opens up it'll probably die off. I also imagine it's going to have to be tuned even easier than it currently is due to the fact that anyone that actually cared about their performance (including people like myself, IMO. I only ran LFR but still did everything I could to be the best at it) will no longer be present in the LFR content.<br />
<br />
They really should have just put a stake in the heart of LFR and declared it 'finished' :) But they are incapable of creating compelling content for non-raiders so they have to do at least something in hopes of keeping some number of non-raiders subscriptions ... and dumb-as-possible raid content is all they can think of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well i'm agree with you. In some case new stuff from LFR can be better than Heroic stuff from previous tier. But in you're example, It was good to have trinkets and tiers gears in LFR since without it you'll have finished with the previous tier trinket and not even experimented the new one. In the future expansion, will end up with previous tiers stuff if you're not lucky. So LFR gives you the opportunity to have it in a lower version. If you ok with your previous stuff, just don't go in LFR, no ?</div></div><hr />

Either that or they are gonna have to offer some form of incentive for tanks and heals like a bag that has 100% drop rate for teir gear or something. Otherwise its just going to flop hardcore this xpac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're really funny :)<br />
<br />
That whole &quot;seeing the content&quot; thing is what players who don't like LFR came up with to try and beat the people they sneer at around the head with ;) LFR is a form of progression for people plain and simple and even Blizzard recognizes this or LFR would give NO gear whatsoever.<br />
<br />
And cupcake, if you were ever in an LFR with me it was probably me carrying your toxic ass across the finish line ;) I never finished less than in the top 2 DPS in any LFR I ever ran and spent numerous hours re-teaching people how to defeat the content. You know exactly jack about me other than I think this is a good change though it will bleed subs and that it's one of many reasons why I'm no longer interested in the game. I find it very funny that you are offended that I dare to not like a game lol.<br />
<br />
And there's that whole 'lazy' thing we see thrown around so often. Do people not realize this is a GAME? A form of entertainment? It's not a job, it doesn't put food on our tables (maybe for the top 0.5%ers lol), it's not going to solve the problems of the world. The fact that you are sitting in a chair typing on a computer to argue about a game right now ranks you (and me!) as part of the top 1% most lazy people in the world :D<br />
<br />
I don't even find you attitude 'disgusting', as you call me. I find you and all those others like you to be funny and amusing ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is the problem most of the people here complaining have....<br />
They are the ones afk'ing in every boss, only auto attacking in every fight, queued as a healer when they are actually retri/shadow/elemental for faster queues screwing the rest of the group,screaming at others calling them bad or noob or worse when they are dead in the very first second of the fight because they suicided to be afk (again)....<br />
<br />
<br />
and now they are saying that they will/have unsubscribed WoW because of the &quot;decisions made by the DEVS for WoD.....<br />
They dont want to try, they dont want to play, they want a chat system that gives epics for free ....<br />
<br />
If most of the ones saying that they will quit, PLEASE DO QUIT.....<br />
try other MMOs , see how shitty they are and then you will return to WoW and complain again.....<br />
<br />
i am the definition of &quot;casual&quot;... between work and family i dont have time for organized raiding, i only LFR and pvp and im fine with the changes.... maybe i will have more fun in lfr if these QQ'ers really quit the game...</div></div><hr />

Ok , it simplifies your tuning of the encounters (Great, i didn't care). Is this again an attempt to reduce development cycles and costs ? I believe so. Another demonstration of will to try to reach the mark of 1 expansion per 1.5 year ?<br />
<br />
I really don't see how most of non-hardcore guilds that have reduced their organization to perform well in 10HC will be able to recruit and go back to a raid20 roster. It was a pain to recruit and maintain a raid25 roster when we abandonned the idea and switched to raid10HC, i don't see why it would be different now.<br />
<br />
So now raid10 roster would be restricted to easymode , clean content in 1-2 monthes then pause their subscription for 4-8 monthes for a new raid tier to show up ? Is that it we have as a future for WoD ? Expect lots of raid10 motivated groups to stop there the adventure.<br />

<br />
If this crutch is gone in Warlords, expect LFR to bite the big one. And that's fine... but if that's going to be the case, they should scrap the feature sooner than later. We'll end up with Warlords being the death-knell of LFR, and maybe they'll say &quot;we admit, it's not working and it's time to remove it&quot; in the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not you not liking the game that's the issue. The issue is that you believe a brain-dead experience is a pivotal aspect of the game and that it should reward with the same gear as other, more challenging content, albeit with a small tweak in stats.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes, it's a game. Even so, the risk-reward system still applies - the greater the risk, the greater the reward. The risk in LFR is minuscule, therefore the rewards can't be all that good.</div></div><hr />

Nothing new, but it's likely to be worse.<br />

We will see more people finish the content faster and have no interest in staying for the long haul.<br />

<br />
I agree. Regular raiders should be out of LFR, and LFR should be only for very casual players that do not wanna commit time and effort to gear, gem and learn rotations. LFR was toxic not because of the attitudes of the committed players, but because it was a getaway drug to getting burned from useless, excessive raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're going to give Raid Finder crappy ugly loot that will still provide a way to gear up with more than likely horrible rates of dropping, and then we're going to put all of the tier gear and weapons that we put actual effort into in Normal and Heroic modes. That way after you get done grinding Raid Finder you can start grinding the regular versions of the road.<br />
<br />
It's not because we want to drag out the content, it's strictly for your enjoyment so that you can get a better experience. Because we ALWAYS do what's best for you! Now go ahead and open up that wallet.<br />

<br />
No Tier in LFR confirmed.<br />
<br />
And like that, Blizzard will spend the rest of the expansion scratching their heads wondering why half the population stopped raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really am wondering how they think this will make a positive impact. Such a terrible decision. They think it's going to make their raids last longer, but all it's going to do is cause the people that don't want to do normal or heroic versions but want to see the raid run raid finder once and then never look back. If they even run it once.<br />
<br />
I'm sure this has more to do with somekind of business strategy than catering to the &quot;hardcore&quot; players, but it seems like those hardcore players are the only ones they aren't willing to sacrifice losing. Which is sad considering how much of a minority they are.</div></div><hr />

Regular raiders should be out of LFR, and LFR should be only for very casual players that do not wanna commit time and effort to gear, gem and learn rotations. LFR was toxic not because of the attitudes of the committed players, but because it was a getaway drug to getting burned from useless, excessive raiding.<br />
<br />
I gear, gem, study and practice my rotations and I prefer raid finder.<br />

It's a flip of a coin in that regard. Lower caliber players are a lot of times more preferable to play with than some over geared lunatic who verbally berates every person in a raid for not cowering to his l337 skills.</div></div><hr />

They shouldn't have the same things that normal / heroic / mythic mode raiders get. When the content is piss easy, and fail buffs stack up so high that chance of failure is almost non existent, why should they be privy to what higher players get?<br />

<br />
No tier or SPECIFIC trinkets, not eliminating all trinkets. I am sure there will be trinkets but you wont find people running lfr for bis trinkets like we have since DS because they are so overpowered or people running LFR for tier bonuses. LFR will go back to what it should be which is people just gearing up or people running on alts for fun. I would assume this also means the death of legendary quest line items in LFR which should have never ever happened. And this is coming form a guy with 5 toons with cloaks, 2 of which mostly cane from said LFR runs.</div></div><hr />

RF allowed me to get great looking gear with good stats on it with the time I have available to me. I liked getting tier gear as I hadn't gotten a piece of tier since Wrath. It was cool seeing the content, but I also loved still feeling like I got valuable gear that went together. The stats weren't as great as Normal or Heroic, but it was essentially the same model, which I was content with. Not allowing trinkets or tier gear is a little disheartening to me. I didn't chose RF because I didn't want to commit to a normal raid group, my schedule didn't allow it. I can't commit to 2+ hours in a raid as I might have to jump up and do some damage control with the kids at any moment. RF doesn't necessarily alleviate that, but it made it a lot easier. Without the tier gear, which was super awesome to get, I won't be doing RF. Tier was enough incentive to do it for me, but without it, I'll probably pass. I'm hoping they change this before launch, but if not, it is what it is. I was so happy to have RF, to finally have a via option to get end-game gear with my schedule. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaylock</div><div class="date">2014-04-30, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My take:<br />
<br />
I really do not like having to do LFR at the moment. It really is no fun. I do it for set bonuses, trinkets, and certain transmog color gear or weapons (as well as required drops for the legendary quest line). <br />
<br />
I do not think LFR should have better gear than heroic dungeons. If they were not going to give tier set bonuses they should make the gear look A LOT better than they have b/c it is ugly. Queue times are going to skyrocket and those people he refers to only wanting to raid 45 minutes or so at a time (which is unrealistic now as queues are that long just to get in) are now going to spend hours just for each wing of LFR. No tier sets, trinkets, tier bonuses, and ugly art are going to be the downfall of LFR. A lot of people who go nowadays do not need it but do it for those sets/bonuses, transmog, and valor. Less players, lower geared players, and less skilled players are going to make each wing of LFR take longer to complete. Unfortunately I think that WoW is going to lose a lot of players b/c of this. No matter the what peoples' opinions are on their skill or whatnot, while this might be good for &quot;real raiding&quot; (and I'm a vanilla player) this will not be good for the subs in WoW.<br />
<br />
All the other raid stuff sounds pretty good. Glad we can just go with who we have on a raid night and not have to worry about odd numbers online. We no longer raid hard core 4 nights a week like we did in vanilla, TBC, and Wrath so these changes are welcome as a lot of our guildies, including myself, have kids and are a lot older nowadays and just want to raid when our friends can and do it together.<br />
<br />
a) They are nearly doubling the rate at which you get LFR gear, so you will gear up much faster.<br />
<br />
b) After you gear up in your LFR gear (very quickly), you will then be decently geared to start doing flex.<br />
<br />
c) You are delusional to think that this is going to lose subscribers. In fact, old subscribers will probably start returning (like me).<br />
<br />
d) Transmog players that raid heroic raids will want to enter LFR just to get the transmog sets there as well, so you will still have a good pool of players that run LFR even if its just for the easy mode gear for transmog<br />
<br />
e) Your &quot;this will not be good for the subs in WoW&quot; is based purely on speculation and has no basis of truth.<br />
<br />
f) set aside an hour or two, three nights a week, and you are now in a progression raiding guild. Simple.<br />

<br />
Confirmed by a bunch of whiny entitled players who don't realize nothing is really changing for them of course. The only confirmation needed!<br />
<br />
Do you feel insulted that they decided to remove sets from lfr? Why do you feel that way (if you do)? It only means you feel entitled to the raid sets even though you are doing a significantly smaller amount of effort. I dont think you really know what entitled means, look in the mirror before you start throwing that around.<br />

I liked the initial idea of LFR as an optional end-game for casuals, but it seems that the LFR experience was unsuccessful in this regard. <br />
I would love if LFR was harder and challenging, not a faceroll tourist mode. :(<br />
But maybe this is impossible, because soon people would cry for nerfs anyway..<br />

<br />
Personally, I think it would have been great if they had just made it so that gear with the LFR tag did not function at all in normal/heroic/mythic raids. As if they were just wearing nothing in that slot.<br />
<br />
And then, conversely, make normal/heroic/mythic gear not function at all outside of those raids since the claim has always been that the reason they need that gear is to do that content. So clearly they don't need it to be superior at world pvp or solo content.<br />
<br />
Gear that is acquired through a certain type of content and best for that content, on ALL levels (not just raiders gear) is the solution to all these problems without alienating anyone.</div></div><hr />

He means current heroic, next expansion's Mythic, which isn't flexible. So yes, he will need to find 9-10 new players. But that's a 5 months old news. So if he didn't plan in advance, it's his own problem. He also has time before WoD launches + he can always merge 2 guilds.</div></div><hr />

The gear in LFR is better than heroic gear from dungeons. You wanna make normals easier, do LFR simply due to the gear. I mean think about it, what if you have 1 or 2 pieces of gear that you can't seem to upgrade through normal due to RNG, well even if it isn't tier gear, LFR gear will be better. The big problem however is LFR will become more barren as time goes on during the tier. Due to the drop rates being upped, you will become more geared faster. Even people who just do LFR will be geared in no time. I know I will do LFR still especially since it helps gear for normal, but yea I would hate to see queue times especially towards the end of the tier when tons of people are geared with no incentive to do LFR. The only thing I think might help is people with lagging alts.</div></div><hr />

You failed to see all the other content that is catered to casuals, such as tougher 5 man heroics, challenge mode 5 mans, garrisons, scenarios, pvp, etc etc etc. The game is not all about raiding, and you dont need tier sets to complete LFR. You just want it to look &quot;kool&quot; and feel like you are a bad ass (when in reality, there is nothing bad ass about LFR in the least bit)<br />
<br />
LFR was meant to be &quot;tourist&quot; mode, as blizzard said it themselves. It was never meant to be the gear progression path. It serves a purpose, and now it will do a better job of serving that purpose as it wont be something that higher players feel compelled to do to gear up.<br />

Haha, another funny guy completely incapable of reading what someone actually said :) You're gonna go far with that mind-reading/intention-gathering ability of yours there, I can tell it.<br />

editing to make sure even these try-hards can understand: I'm moving on to Wildstar, where I will almost certainly never raid at all and never see a single piece of raid gear and have no problem with that at all ... because there will be content designed solely for solo/small-group players with gear that is superior for that solo/small-group play. I'm going to put the time and (haha, in a game!) effort into the content I desire to experience and be rewarded with progression in that content.

Your queue time is atrocious because you are a DPS class in a sea of DPS players, and the proportion of players queuing as DPS is TOO HIGH for a functional raid. This is simple supply and demand. This is why people can sell tanking services, and why Blizzard implemented the &quot;call to arms&quot; role bonus for tanks and healers. If a 25man LFR raid is 2 tanks, 6 heals, 17 DPS, that allows for 68% of people queuing to be DPS, and the vast majority of your queue time is because this proportion is too high.<br />
<br />
Even if a lot of people stop using LFR (and trust me, it's not like it'll go completely unused after a couple weeks, don't be ridiculous), it'll still successfully organize groups just fine, there will simply be FEWER TOTAL LFR GROUPS. The only thing that will affect your queue time is the relative demand of your role, i.e. the proportion of people queuing as DPS, when you're a DPS class. Sure increased liquidity (total number of queuers) might help the overall fluctuation of queue-times, but it's not getting at the actual problem, which is the proportion of DPS players.<br />
<br />
What's the difference in your LFR queue time if there are 1 million concurrent LFR queuers versus only 10,000, assuming in both cases 80% of the people queuing are DPS? ZERO. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.<br />
<br />
What the change to LFR means:<br />
Gear rewards for LFR are reduced (boohoo I have to work for nice trinkets and tier now) -&gt; fewer serious raiders have incentive to ever join LFR -&gt; LFR's difficulty must be made even easier, system won't need to be abused by hardcore guilds -&gt; queue times UNAFFECTED assuming the same proportion of tank/heal/DPS, even though less total people queuing for LFR at any given time.<br />
<br />
In fact, queue times, the ability to push through and finish LFRs, and lowering the chance of being queued into a failing LFR might all be improved with:<br />
1) LFR being easier<br />
2) the flex 10-25 system<br />
3) having only 1 tank or ~4 healers required<br />
<br />
Blizzard might do well to try to cater a little more to the &quot;flex-schedule&quot; folks... perhaps some kind of heroic LFR, where you personally have to complete normal LFR with some benchmark performance? Honestly that's kind of what they're getting at with the change to normal / flex raids anyways.<br />
<br />
Hopefully blizzard's raid grouping system will help facilitate real raiders going in to flex raids, actually communicating with other people, and you know, actually raiding. LFR's loot pinata needed a nerf.</div></div><hr />

It's simple, there is a significant part of the player base for whom LFR just works. Blizz has identified that. <br />
<br />
LFR needs to provide rewards because we don't just play WoW for the lulz. <br />
<br />
Those rewards don't have to be part of the same-tier raid progression model because most of the people who LFR for the core reasons for LFR (see the content AND some sense of gear progression) aren't going to Flex when they gear up, as some have suggested they should, because SCHEDULE.<br />
<br />
What those rewards do need to do, for the players who aren't using LFR as a resource for filler gear, is be sufficient for put the LFR player at a sufficient iLvl for the next tier of LFR when it is released.</div></div><hr />

Find a guild that doesn't raid purely for the purples.<br />
Find aguild where social interaction and progress are valued.<br />
<br />
Less likely to get an arse that grabs loot and disappears, though you'll never get rid of that completely.<br />
<br />
Most importantly: Don't play for the purples yourself. Gear is a tool needed to be ready for the next content. Nothing more.<br />

Doubtful. But possible. Devalue until unused -&gt; remove without much QQ.<br />
<br />
Still, LFRers don't need set bonuses or OP trinkets. Raiders do. (As in NEED for the next Boss that is designed with that OP loot in mind)</div></div><hr />

I remember my rogue getting screwed on getting his legendary in Cata... the guy was a RL friend of my raid leader... he got the second set... and then he left. The. Fucking. Day. After. Up until that point I was the only rogue in the guild, and this dipshit comes swooping in from a break on an alt... I'm glad my work schedule prevents me from going hardcore again.

Great. Now I have a full set of LFR gear. Whens the last time someone with a full set of LFR gear was invited to a normal or flex group?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
b) After you gear up in your LFR gear (very quickly), you will then be decently geared to start doing flex.<br />
Except the Flex groups will all be requiring you to have heroic gear in order to do it so its going to block anybody actually trying to step up.<br />

c) You are delusional to think that this is going to lose subscribers. In fact, old subscribers will probably start returning (like me).<br />
People number of people that will leave will more then likely be &gt; then the people that come back. As these changes really only help put up more barriers then really are necessary.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
d) Transmog players that raid heroic raids will want to enter LFR just to get the transmog sets there as well, so you will still have a good pool of players that run LFR even if its just for the easy mode gear for transmog<br />
Yes the over whelmingly small percentage of people that actually do heroic content. The subcategory of that, the Heroic Transmog Raider enthusiast is going to keep this afloat. So that's what maybe 5000 people across all the servers?<br />

Just look at the begining of cata. MMO Champ was gleefully swimming in the tears of all the people that couldn't do the heroics. Look how that turned out. Removing accessibility in this game DOES NOT make people step up. They just outright quit as there is a million other PC games that actually offer progression paths that do not require relying on 24 other people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And from what I'm reading, that would be the case. The progression to Normal (ex-Flex) raiding should be Heroic Dungeons and LFR loot will be right between that and Normal rewards level.<br />
<br />
<br />
... which in an interesting twist could put H-Dungeons in more danger than LFR. Whichever one has the lower queue times could quite possibly make the other obsolete, since both offer the gateway gear into N-Raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another funny thing here is Normal has no iLvl restriction, where H-Dungeons and LFR do. So while LFR is the supposed bottom-feeding, entitled lazy crowd, they actually have to achieve a certain iLvl before they can participate, while the &quot;REAL RAIDERS&quot; can jump into N-Raid with whatever gear happens to BIS for pre-raid, even if that's a quest blue/green.</div></div><hr />

you are wrong from the very beggining of the sentence, subs loss was at the END of the expansion and was PURLY coused by the massive outrage that was 1 year of DS and damn pandas at the end of that waiting, yea ppl were barging about difficulty , but guess what ? it coused NO SUBS LOSS ! even more subs were still raising ! the moral from this story is this story is that, ppl get ALWAY upset about ANY change and keep spamming troll comment sections like this, but if game is still enjoyable (and trust me it will be) they won't quit</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can see this now, if you are not either in a raid group already or in a guild that intends to raid. People are going to be treat as if they had the plague wearing lfr gear. It will be even worse than those that try to wearing PVP gear into a raid. The gear is going to make them stand out because it will not even look like normal and above raid gear. Hell someone with Heroic dungeon gear will be let into a flex, normal, or whatever this group finder option is going to be. It will be no different then now, they presently require the meta gem, cloak, and a 540 ilvl to do flex SoO. This is going to be a mess.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I do not think it would be to be a stretch to see them lose more than they gain here. They got more than a few things above and beyond this and flying that many are pissed about. They might get some of the people like you back, but some of them might not like the game they have not played in awhile this player base has gotten pretty toxic over the last 3 or 4 years. I guess if your in a decent guild with friends it will have little impact, but your in for a rude awakening if you have not play since wrath or better. <br />
<br />
<br />
Transmog players that raid heroic raids will want to enter LFR just to get the transmog sets there as well, so you will still have a good pool of players that run LFR even if its just for the easy mode gear for transmog<br />
<br />
Not sure why someone that is going to be getting T17 gear would want the likes of the LFR style gear in the first place for transomog purposes in the first place. The crafted gear looks better at this point and I am sure even the normal and heroic dungeon gear will look better as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
Your &quot;this will not be good for the subs in WoW&quot; is based purely on speculation and has no basis of truth.<br />
<br />
This has the potential to kick Blizzard seriously in the behind. People are going to be treated worse because they have gear that looks total different, not just color this time around. They are going to b treated as if they has Leprosy. This fix, is not just to keep the normal raider from going into the LFR. This is to further segregate the populous between the raider from the non-raider for good. Someone with this gear would be better to use it to get them through the proving grounds, if needed to overcome it and then turn around and get heroic dungeon gear as quick as possible or just find a group of people to go to the various heroic dungeons, if they plan to raid. Because they are not getting in with LFR gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
set aside an hour or two, three nights a week, and you are now in a progression raiding guild. Simple.<br />
<br />
Some people just do not have three night a week to devote to a scheduled raid team and if its anything like I have experience since the end of wrath. It took more than one hour or longer most nights to get the team together, let alone try to kill a boss or clear some trash. I stopped because I just could not take the disregard or disrespect some had for others. At the beginning of MoP I went searching for raid group on another realm, find one joined and transfer characters over. Two weeks, is all it took and the group fell apart, because someone got butt hurt and did not get their own way. This lead to the rest finding another guild or to making one to raid in, I followed a couple of the decent people, same thing happened again. After moving from one guild to the next (mine you, I was in one guild for all of BC and Wrath) 7 times, I finally gave up. That is when I stuck to the LFR, until I just could not stand all the numb nuts on both side constantly bitch and complaining and acting like complete asses, I stopped doing that after awhile too. <br />
<br />
I made the switch to playing ESO and Diablo, having a blast with both, at this point I am just not sure I want to come back to playing WoW. If I could find one of those Friends and Family type guild I used to be in for two xpacs, I probably would. Because I do not want anything to do with the coming rendition of the LFR and being treated as if I were an outcast. I also have no desire to go back to normal type of progression guild, I just don't have the time to waste on that again.</div></div><hr />

I am in a heroic guild so the LFR changes wont really affect me.Hell the only times i did LFR was for my alts to get the legendary quest items else i wouldn't set foot in it.But i guess i will do some LFR in WoD if we have some cool items for transmog there (since the items there are different than the other dificulties &quot;amirite&quot;?).<br />
I haven't been interested in capping my valor for months now as i have nothing to spend it on,so the change to valor in making it less incentive to cap it makes me happy.<br />
<br />
LFR was designed to be available for people who don't care about joining competitive raiding (normal,heroic) or don't have the time raiding in schedules set by guilds.It's just an environment to make those people experience the game content.<br />
<br />
Since pretty much the higher difficulties we have nowadays gets downgraded in WoD,perhaps the people running LFR now will run flexible mode in WoD.<br />
<br />
As for some peoples concern regarding flexible normal/heroic mode in that some guildies will step out from the raiding day/night if the guild plans to kill bosses they don't need loot from,well do like this: &quot;fool me once,ok;fool me twice /gkick&quot;.Raid scales anyway.</div></div><hr />

No I'm not. There was a huge Sub loss right after the release of the game Cata was the first Xpac that started hemorrhaging subs immediately after the initial bump from the new expatiation. Cata lost subs every quarter the entire xpac until the end where they only stabilized because of the yearly deal that got you Diablo 3 and guaranteed access to the MOP Beta.</div></div><hr />

They began falling steadily through Cata. 11.4 million first quarter after the start of Cata. 11.1 second quarter. 10.3 third quarter where it evened out until a drop to 9.1 at the end of Cata. The subscriptions went back up to 10 million at the beginning of MoP and then started dropping again to where we are now at 7.8 million. Cata caused a 3 million subscriber loss.

2) However I have no problem with removing trinkets and sets from LFR, Flexi will take over a lot of that particular niche anyway. And at least it'll shut up those &quot;OMG I have to do LFR&quot; people. For about five seconds.<br />
3) NM and Flexi were on different lockouts and this mostly worked out okay (though I wasn't gearing that seriously this tier). I'm not entirely sure that the new NM/HM being on different lockouts will work so well.<br />
4) Especially concerned about Mythic not sharing a lockout. TOTC had a handful of bosses and two difficulties, we're now talking about four versions of a raid on separate lockouts with many more bosses. Non linearity is great and all but there's always going to be one guy in the raid who needs the wrist off that boss everyone else wants to skip. Even taking VP out of the picture, I'm concerned there will be a lot of people who feel like they should clear bosses 2-3 times per week, or even 4. It's possible the payoff will be low enough that this won't be a huge issue, but we've already seen that people will burn themselves out simply because doing way too much content is theoretically optimal.</div></div><hr />

If some 8 people leave after the first boss, the rest of the players can do the remaining content.<br />
<br />
My understanding is regardless of the 'flexibility' LFR will still require two tanks &amp; that is traditionally where the problem has occurred with queue times. With the other changes to healing &amp; gearing I think you can expect a lot less healers to do LFR as well which will further exacerbate the problem. Queues time will not shorten just because now you don't need a full complement of DPS to start.</div></div><hr />

(They said &quot;equal to heroic dungeons&quot; before, is that still true?) There was also mention of &quot;no specific trinkets&quot; that would &quot;force&quot; raiders into LfR, which i assume means &quot;different trinkets&quot;? (None at all would be overly harsh IMO)<br />
<br />
Oh well, at least we have some actual information now, i hope some of the details get filled out with replies to the watercooler... (I can't ask myself, i have an EU account. :P )<br />
<br />
They won't necessarily be horrific, because theoretically the same % of healers, tanks, and DPS won't play them anymore. So queue times should remain similar.<br />
<br />
What I see happening is a very dead opening tier of LFR. With no practical loot incentive, who's going to put up with the crap of other 9-24 other randoms? Folks will run dungeons to gear up, which allow many more drop possibilities. Since there are no incentives for raiders to do LFR, even past the initial tier where the non-raiding casual will start going since it will then theoretically start dropping significantly better gear than dungeons - however the raiders will still bypass it, meaning LFR will have to be even more of a joke than it currently is for a group of 10-25 not-raiders to down bosses.<br />
<br />
I'm not really tore up about it though, regardless of the fact that I think it will go largely unused and be a joke instance. To be honest, I really don't care for doing LFRs currently. I know many folks run it, so I can see there being a negative impact to the player base, but it won't hurt me since it gives me more reason to never step foot in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The sad part is that they did learn the lesson in Cata, and gave us a very easy (a little too easy, IMO) DragonSoul. I say they did learn because they stanched the tide of sub losses in the first 6 months of DragonSoul that we saw all during T11 and Firelands. Then after confusing LFR as the &quot;fix&quot; and not an easy overall raid tier, they repeated the same mistakes in T14 &amp; T15 and made normal raiding even less accessible than T11, and saw subs immediately start dropping again.<br />
<br />
Personally, I believe the answer for player retention in PVE end game falls largely to an accessible &quot;bear league&quot; flex (soon to be normal) mode, I think we'll be ok with LFR dying out. The key will be to continue to allow the soon to be, normal mode, accessibility to friends&amp;family raiders who don't raid kick guildies because they suck.</div></div><hr />

The thing is, over the course of 9 years, not much has changed in Wow, speaking of the gameplay. And that's where there's a lot to gain. All expansions have an x amount of raids and dungeons, and that's where the focus is. Instead look at games like ArcheAge or Everquest Next, and what they're adding to the game experience. Innovation never has been Wow's strong suit.</div></div><hr />

Improve upon the core in a significant way, that's not something they have done or will ever do. And I get why they won't, to not alienate their core audience, but at least add things that will enrich the gameplay.<br />
(Guild)housing, farming, boats, more exploring, less themepark, there are loads of things they could borrow/copy from other games to make the experience richer. ArcheAge is a great example btw.</div></div><hr />

But that said, I'd rather raid with a 15 man team that changes from week to weak and suffers from inconsistency than a solid 8 man team that sits at the outside the instance while the raid leader spams trade chat for to fill the last two spots.<br />
<br />
This just truly lets me believe, people have no idea how these feature came to be, in the first place. No, it was so bad with guild jumpers and such, that LFG and LFR were implemented in the first place. Gearing up a couple of people, in the premise that they are committed to the guild, only to quit when progression slows. This problem was so bad near the end of TBC, it took most of WOTLK to get the LFG for use. Which is some of the reason we had ToC. The player based DEMANDED the tool due to the arguments you are spouting. Shits come full circle.<br />
<br />
The reason you need an MMO to be HUGE is the pool of players. The game is getting more and more exclusive with each sub loss, people that are good enough to raid Normal or Heroic, might not. Simply because there isn't a place for them. Personality clashes, skill overtures, class supply, time issues, and fuck ton of other valid reasons. You have limited spots with limited organization. Sub losses are VERY bad for the game and all this shit about double such and such game, is a fucking rhetoric nightmare.<br />
<br />
Eventually, you will get excluded too. When that times comes, and it will. You might want to play the game still, or maybe not. If you do, you want options. When options are taken or changed on you for no reason with little to no logic behind it, you will say something about it. I just hope people remember these moments.<br />

Let me ask you something, what reason is there to take away Tier gear from LFG? It's a lower Ilvl, its unoptimized, and looks worse than it's counter parts.

Is it bad that something is reserved to higher difficulties? <br />
<br />
The problem was that it pushed elitist jerks down into the LFR raids because some trinkets and setbonuses where so OP that even the worst versions of them where an upgrade over BiS from the last tier. So people that has no interest of being at LFR level + People that is LFR level players = Not a good combination.<br />
<br />
More then once have I seen hc raiders rage, curse and mock other players for their low effort/skill.<br />
So in one way it add some prestige to the higher forms of raiding. And in another it removes toxic assholes from LFR.</div></div><hr />

LFR will now be used by the people it was intended for, those who can't or won't go into normal mode raiding due to schedule, skill or any other factor. Getting gear that's &quot;close&quot; on regular raid gear...QQ about sets? Really? C'mon...<br />
<br />
Time and time again there's this &quot;I can't join a normal guild because you won't let me in as I'm using wrong gems or whatever&quot;. That's a bloody load of bullshit. No, heroic (mythic) progression guilds will probably not let you in. &quot;Normal&quot; social guilds who are on a more normal level don't lock out people as a rule. Some might, but others won't. Just make an effort at least, if some of that is mistakes that's ok, at least you've tried. But an application that consists of &quot;I'm awesome in LFR and I want to raid with you, invite plx&quot; isn't going to cut it. You don't need to be awesome, you just need to show that you will try and you will contribute the same as everybody else does, that's it. That was the case BEFORE LFR was introduced and it's the case now. Difference is now you can quicker and easier get the gear you need/want in order to be ready for &quot;normal&quot; raiding through LFR.<br />
<br />
For those that cannot or will not commit to guild raiding: What has changed? You wouldn't raid without these changes, you won't raid with them. Why care?<br />
<br />
Again, set up a raid yourself if time constraints is a significant issue, with the new normals being easier, flexible and cross realm you have such a minimal reason to QQ it's absurd. This is QQ just to QQ, behaving like spoiled brats.<br />
<br />
We may lose some people due to this but as these should be the forum QQ'ers then good riddance, it will improve the game vastly to finally have you gone. Unfortunately that won't happen but..</div></div><hr />

Well at least it's nice to know a few players understand the underlying problem. Kudos to you for so succinctly explaining the issue. None of the people you reference as being part of a larger problem will listen of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is some revisionist history. I was in the top raiding guild on my server at the time of Cataclysm. In the beginning of Cata most raiders were completely unaffected by the terrible start Cata had, blind to what the casual experience was. This is not my opinion, this is objective fact; when you reached level 85 the game essentially ended. If you were not a progression player you would not in normal circumstances be able to stay sane doing random heroics. People said then, and you will likely say now &quot;they should have joined a guild&quot; frankly, this is not an option for millions of people, believe it or not. For others they are just not good and they are HAPPY not being good. They like being casuals, they don't want to be super hardcore raider with that kind of guild.<br />
<br />
So what Cataclysm did was listen to the vocal minority and created what was essentially forced difficult punishing content unless you were in a raiding guild. And yes unless you were in raid gear or heroic/raid gear as I was before we moved on to HMs the heroics were absolutely unpuggable. You cannot with a straight face tell me that MoP does not have hardcore content when fights like H Garrosh exist. But in Cata no one even wanted a healer that wasn't a Holy Paladin. The raid tier was short and overall the few months of Cataclysm was objectively awful. Objectively by anyone with the good sense to look at both perspectives. For me I had a raiding guild and I had an alt guild (as alts were not allowed in guild unless they were also raiding.)<br />
<br />
Cataclysm lost over two million subs in a few months, just think about that. That was right at the beginning. They got a good portion of those back when they introduced LFR. Pandaria saw tremendous growth and put the derailed train back on track. Casuals dictate the game. As a raider I am the 5%, but personally I detest quite a lot of entitled raiders who personally think the game's life revolves around them, that they have to be catered to or they'll &quot;Leave for Wildstar! I'm super serious this time Blizzard!&quot; Only to come back in WoD.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm was a terrible expansion that's biggest problem was listening to the hardcore playerbase, and they understandable wanted to close the book on that xpac as fast as they could. So development ended on Cata and began on Pandaria, resulting in a stagnant end raid and weak final boss. The result is Pandaria which in my opinion as someone who's been playing from vanilla beta is third behind TBC and WotLK as the best eras WoW has ever had.<br />
<br />
Cata was terrible, which is sad because I'm also a Warcraft junkie in general and looked on in horror as what happened to the xpac overall.</div></div><hr />

Its extremely hard to grow your raiding guild, especially if you aren't high on the world ranks. Why they're putting such a huge hardship on small tight raiding guilds with the 20 man mythic I'll never understand. Worst change by far for general health of top end raiding in wow and raiding guilds in general. Think about how long it took you to get a consistent 10man raid group going. Now double it! Sound fun right? Huge high end raids don't work. Haven't you guys learned that lesson with 40man raiding in vanilla and the 10 man shift? And its STILL server limited. Poorly thought out.<br />
<br />
There is almost no difference between current flex difficulty and LFR, except that you use 3rd party tools to group instead of bliz made tools. Probably the most meaningless change they've made in terms of getting players to &quot;step up to the challenge&quot;, but the most harmful in general for the lower end raiding crowd. Which also happens to be the hugest raiding segment. More artist time devoted to poor looking alternate sets for content instead of truly new raid content. Higher queue times because people have no real reason to run lfr more than once since loot is no longer a factor. <br />

<br />
As for Heroic and Mythic, having those difficulties share a lockout would present a number of technical as well as logistical challenges: Heroic is a flexible-size loot-based lockout; Mythic is a fixed-size boss-based lockout, limited to a single realm, with a static ID. The two simply aren’t congruent. Having these on a separate lockout also simplifies some things for high-end guilds that are trying to manage progress on a limited schedule, and currently have to carefully budget enough time at the end of each week to re-kill remaining bosses on Normal difficulty for loot. In Warlords, those groups will be able to frontload their farming for the week and then work on Mythic progression for the rest of the week without worry.<br />
Does this mean that the heroic and mythic are in a separate lockout and you can do them both in the same week? How is this in any way in line with their previous mention that they don't wanna people to burn themselves out and feeling obligated to clear multiple difficulties in the same week? How I see this turning out is that every serious mythic raider is going to want to clear the heroic difficulty first as long as anyone can get loot from it and then move on to mythic. It's going to be even worse then on this expansion when you have to clear the remainder of your ID's bosses you couldn't kill in heroic in normal.<br />
<br />
Why not just make them separate lockouts but one excluding the other. You pick either heroic or mythic difficulty for the week and once you have picked you can't choose the other anymore. This way you won't feel obligated to run them both and potentially make the content feel redundant in the end of the tier because you've been essentially killing the same bosses twice. Anyone who actually wishes that you could run the both difficulties every week?</div></div><hr />

Not sure why this is any different for players, LFR is not really meant to be the end game.LFR is end game for far more subscribers than all of the rest of raiding.<br />

Why does the content in wow constantly get better, but the way to access said content swing from good to terrible and back again so much?According to a tweet from one of the developers yesterday, LFR gear ilevel will be between heroic dungeon gear and normal raid gear. So, I'm not seeing why people won't be running LFR to gear up for normal raiding. Apparently, we can go from heroic dungeon gear to normal raiding but to get even better geared for normal raiding, the route is LFR. See you all in LFR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem was that it pushed elitist jerks down into the LFR raids because some trinkets and setbonuses where so OP that even the worst versions of them where an upgrade over BiS from the last tier. So people that has no interest of being at LFR level + People that is LFR level players = Not a good combination.<br />
<br />
More then once have I seen hc raiders rage, curse and mock other players for their low effort/skill.<br />
So in one way it add some prestige to the higher forms of raiding. And in another it removes toxic assholes from LFR.<br />
<br />
You side stepped my question.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with reserving better gear for higher difficulties. LFR &gt; was better optimized, with a higher ilvl and better colors. <br />
<br />
So again, why wasn't that enough?</div></div><hr />
