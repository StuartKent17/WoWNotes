<br />
Is it to much to ask that essences are bound to their own content, or letting us get them by doing whatever content we preferred? during legion you could get every single legendary by doing the content you actually liked, instead of having to do PvP so you would be able to min-max your PvE experience...</div></div><hr />

No one forces you to do that. The rank 3 pvp talent essence is actually even for a PVE player &quot;easy&quot; to get.</div></div><hr />

Meanwhile, Ret gets to move 30% unless you need to hold on to Freedom to actually remove a snare with.<br />
<br />
Almost like when you slap movement speed onto it, it makes the design counter-intuitive because you want to move as fast as you can usually, yet in doing so you're not going to be removing snares all the time.<br />
<br />
How fun.<br />

I don't see anything saying you have to do PvP to get this.<br />
Just that it allows you to use a PvP talent in PvE.<br />

Get out of here with that crap, people wanted class specific things, the entire essence system should have been class/spec specific. Now they do give you one class/spec specific thing and most of them are garbage.<br />

What are you talking about there are like 3 other spec specific Major Essences. Pick one of them then. Or roll one of the classes you think will have that broken essence. This is good for the game. If everyone gets the same it will be boring af.</div></div><hr />

They don't have to be the same, but giving boomkin that and then something like smokebomb to rogue is broken as fuck.<br />

Maybe an other class specific essence will be a défensivement for druid and dps for rogue you know. So rogue will target the other one, unless they want a double talent for pvp</div></div><hr />

It's only spell crit, so won't be that huge a dps increase. <br />

However it will still be mandatory since that means more crit for your healers. <br />

Smokebomb would be great for saving M+ runs on bad pulls, and the hunter ones allows them to double soak if needed; Rets are always complaining about mobility.

12% Spell crit, so about 6% more Raid DPS isn't to shabby. Feral is much weaker with only 5% physical crit.<br />
<br />
Especially since keeping that up is pretty trivial. Once you stacked it up, you just need one SS every 18 seconds, and if you can't manage that, you're probably not up to raiding to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i belive you get it wrong. Every starsurge = 4 % spell crit to 8 players for 18 seconds. They can stack up to 3 times.<br />
<br />
So one moonkin casting 3 starsurges in a row would give a total of 96% spellcrit for 18 seconds. His fourth starsurge like 5 seconds later give another 32% spell crit for 18 seconds (but to other casters since the first 8 already got 3 stacks, although its gonna be random i belive).</div></div><hr />

There are two other spec specific essences.<br />
<br />
One example.<br />
<br />
<br />
Memory of Lucid Dreams<br />
Major Power (Instant, 3 min cooldown): Clear your mind and attune yourself with the Heart of Azeroth, increasing your Holy Power generation rate by 100%, and your Leech by 874, for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
Minor Power: Your spells and abilities have a chance to refund 50% of the Holy Power spent on them and immediately heal you for 10,860. When Lucid Dreams refunds some Holy Power to you, gain 543 Versatility for 8 sec.<br />
Vision of Perfection<br />
Major Power (Passive): Your spells and abillities have a chance to activate Crusade for 50% of its base cooldown. When the Vision of Perfection activates, the cooldown of Crusade is reduced by 10 sec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For 1.5 seconds? Grats, you immune a big ability and die to small ones, same as normal. It also requires the use of FD, so if timed wrong you can actually hurt a groups wipe recovery in a m+ or raid group.<br />
The point is it is so inconsequential it’s nearly pointless.<br />
PvP it can work because you can help keep yourself alive thru a Greater Pyro or something along those lines, but as it stands Blizz could give BM the Basilisk trait, MM could get Sniper Shot, where SV would literally get nothing for a damage increase (great design there by Blizzard btw), and I’m sure Ret has a damage increase.<br />
The FD is purely situational whereas the damage boosts are gauranteed gains.<br />
As someone else stated, all of these should be damage increases or mobility/survival increases.</div></div><hr />

well, i never said that i was being forced to do it, but if you know anything about high-end raiding, you also know that whatever advantage you can get to help push progression (ie getting server first and shit), you will be expected to go and get that advantage (either by farming islands, pushing alts for split runs, etc). so when blizzard decided a pvp essence would be strong for pve, that kinda makes me mad cause i know my guild will expect me to go and farm that one :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's not about the difficulty in getting the essence. is the fact that grinding content you have no interest in, just so you can use that in the content you actually are focusing on, is annoying. i don't want to do bgs (or rated bgs for that matter) so i can maximize my own utility in raids<br />
<br />
you might be ok with that, but i'm not. doesn't mean i won't do it, but i'll hold the grudge against blizzard for making this bad design choice (as will other players who do not want to do pvp in this game, but still want to be useful in their raid groups)<br />
<br />
as Onikaroshi said: &quot;They should just give everyone back their Artifact ability&quot;<br />

It turns out doing something based on that spec makes it spec specific. Some specs will get a lot more then others from increase cooldown uptime or more resources.

<br />

<br />
Possibly, but how many of these have we seen this xpac? Rogues get several seconds of immunity where Hunters get 1.5 seconds. So on a fight like Jadefire and soaking flame patches, Rogues could use cloak and sprint over them without getting popped up. Hunters have turtle for this. A FD bonus would just drop the damage from the burst and require Disengage to land without dying and you only soak 1. So yeah, it could clear 1 every 30 seconds, but with a rotation of classes you will be more efficient just doing that with 3 players over the fight.<br />
The utility can be nice, but it’s just too situational.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It literally doesn’t do the same thing for every spec. Getting more holy power isn’t the same as getting more mana, getting a faster recharge on your shield isn’t the same as getting more rage. For some specs it changes game play for others it doesn’t that makes it not the same.</div></div><hr />

Just because they have to give it something else because giving a prot paladin mana regen would do nothing doesn't mean they're different.<br />
<br />
They do the same thing, its all generic trash, the passive skills on you artifact weapon were more interesting.<br />
<br />
they accomplish the same thing, they're boring, generic, trash.<br />
<br />
They should have done things like &quot;Sacrafice all your demons for a soul bolt that does X% of dmg plus Y for every demon sacraficed&quot; for demo lock or something, not all the boring generic garbage they did.</div></div><hr />

No, it doesn't, because one affects mana and one affects runic power doesn't make them anything but generic.<br />
<br />
Honestly it probably won't stay that it affects SotR because that's far too much for that ability.<br />

They do do the same thing.... how are you not seeing this? Ok, let's look at your precious SOTR one and then look at the other tanks:<br />
<br />
SotR by 50%, ok, cool, you get to hit sotr more.<br />
DK: runic power gen by 100%... guess what... that means you get to hit Death strike more since it's runic power based now!<br />
Warrior: rage gen by 100%.... oh yea, both IP and shield block cost rage so you get to hit them more!<br />
Monk: energy gen by 100%..... so you get to hit more jabs which lowers the brew cooldowns... so you get to hit more brews....<br />
DH: More pain generation... more soul cleave...<br />
<br />
Hmm... pretty much the same across the board, just had to do a LITTLE differently with Paladin because mana regen doesn't affect anything with Sotr so they had to give the extra uses directly instead of through resources.</div></div><hr />

That's not how PvP talents work in PvE. PvP talents work in war mode, against mobs too, and the talent scales based on what you're fighting, with a damage cap. Note it says -up to- 6%. Same with Greater Pyroblast, fire mages dealing 35% of max health works on players, but has a hard cap damage on mobs. You don't see a mage 3 shotting a world boss.</div></div><hr />

Your the one who keeps bringing up sotr I was using holy power as an example as it’s far more game changing. <br />
<br />
But even going though tanks do you really think they all work the same? 100% more rage doesn’t effect a warrior the same way 50% sotr would as sotr is just a physical mitigation while ignore pain is every thing. Then theres dk’s where death strike is a heal so you could recover from being low in a way you couldn’t do your self as a Pally or warrior.<br />
<br />
You wouldn’t just slap this essence in and have it effect all the tanks playstyles the same.</div></div><hr />

It's generic, it does basically the same thing. Decreasing a major Cooldown like perfection enhancing gearbox does affects each spec differently but it's still generic.<br />
<br />
Also, I think they removed holy power from the Memory of Lucid Dreams, it no longer says it provides it.</div></div><hr />

I think you, and others, misread what that says. It says the Damage is capped at the players maximum health, meaning if 6% of the bosses HP exceeds the DKs health, then it just does damage equal to their maximum health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Especially since keeping that up is pretty trivial. Once you stacked it up, you just need one SS every 18 seconds, and if you can't manage that, you're probably not up to raiding to begin with.<br />
<br />
The feral crit + heal is humongous though. 6% of your max health every 6s could save the raid in a lot of clutch situations. <br />
<br />
Either way I can see every bleeding edge group requiring one of each. <br />
<br />
Which is really the big deal, it locks at least one if not two raid slots. Although on bleeding edge I think it's feral that needs more love than a lazer chicken.</div></div><hr />

The problem isnt really that we get op stuff, but rather that specs like boomie get 12% crit chance, while other specs get some C-tier pvp talent that gives some crappy uttility. Unholy for example should get abom, not necrotic strike.</div></div><hr />

No, those talents/abilities have a damage cap. For instance, if I do a 2m HP elite for a WQ or so, it doesn't do 6% of that npc's life. Much less.</div></div><hr />

The whole point of this essence is that these abilities become usable in PvE, well that and allowing PvPers the option to have 4 (not including the trinket slot) talents.<br />

&quot;The latest PTR update added a new essence, Conflict and Strife, to the repertoire of options currently in the patch. However, this one is a little more interesting as its major slot allows a specific predetermined talent from your spec's PvP talent pool to be used in PvE content at all times.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
sry, but you are wrong, here is why:<br />
1.) spell crit from moonking is always random targets, so even melee can get the buff. <br />
2.) you can not manage which targets will get the stacks per cast, so the stacks will often drop, loosing their potential<br />
3.) if healer will get stacks, it is not &quot;more Raid DPS&quot;<br />
4.) even if 1.) + .2) points were wrong (which they are not), considering 25 man raid size, 2-5-9-9 for example, there are 9 dps casters and 11 melee dmgers (9 dps + 2 tanks)<br />
if 8 casters will get + 12% crit chance, it is exactly 3.84% dmg increase (considering random targets and drops of buff, it is somewhere at 0.7-1.6 based on luck). on the other side, there are 11 melee dmgers with stable 5% crit, which means 2.2% increase at all time. not mentioning minor increase to, for example, shadowfiend, which also benefit from melee crit, etc.<br />
and forgot to mention feral aura is healing these 11 people almost every 6 sec for decent amount of hp, big stuff, even for the tanks. feral aura &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; moonking aura, clearly</div></div><hr />
