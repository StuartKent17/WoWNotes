Numbers scaling up over time<br />
They are just numbers. Automobiles used to cost hundreds of dollars a few generations ago and now they cost tens of thousands of dollars. But most everything else economic related has scaled up as well.<br />
<br />
There isn't any inherent scaling problem with WoW's numbers getting absurdly large. The only real issue is comprehension when you're looking at a rogue doing 240,000 dps to a boss a billion health. But consider that we aren't that far away from character levels themselves being in the triple digits.<br />
<br />
To fix the issue, we would have to go back and have level 1 characters do less than 1 point of damage, which would be pretty weird. Or we could use some kind of metric system where the last few zeros just get lopped off after a certain point. We joke about breastplates with megastamina and megadamage and megadps. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25172040531/historical-dps-trends-and-cata/))<br />
<br />
Haste / Attack Speed Bonus<br />
Yeah, it went from &quot;melee haste&quot; (which needed a modifier to distinguish it from spell haste) to just &quot;melee attack speed.&quot; At this point it's probably safe to just call it &quot;attack speed&quot; since that sounds like weapons (melee and ranged) and not spells. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25134893717/cataclysm-utility-of-a-shadow-priest/))<br />
<br />
&quot;Unique&quot; Item Procs<br />
The main problem they bring is how to balance them. You mention several items that were definitely cool back in the day, but some of they also had to be nurfed into oblivion due to the problems they caused. Then on the other side is that a proc sounds cool but to keep it balanced the proc chance is super low or something like that which makes a stat-stick item more consistent and more useful.<br />
<br />
That said, the unique item procs idea made a bit of a comeback in Icecrown Citadel and is something we like doing. We have learned a lot of the years on how to balance these types of items while also trying to prevent it from interfering with something like arena PvP. We would like to keep doing procs and we'll see how things go in Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
[...] When examples are used that doesn't mean they are the be-all-end-all reasoning for things. We have also run into problems with procs that are so awesome the item is used way beyond the expected range for it. (Hi Thunderfury, how are you today? Have you been chatting with your buddy Stormherald lately?)<br />
<br />
We want the procs to be cool, fun, but not overpowered. The overpowered aspect applies to both PvP and PvE. While we would love to make procs that just ignore the min/max factor of gear, we can't really do that as it will either make the item overpowered (see above) or possibly so bad that even the previous tier is ahead. Also, while we stayed away from them for awhile, we did make a bunch in ICC and they were pretty successful so will see how things go in the future.

Warlocks in Cataclysm<br />
We like Shadow Bolt being the nuke for both Demonology and Affliction. That isn't likely to change. Talents don't have to be in &quot;your tree&quot; for them to be good talents for your build. We generally consider 0 / 0 / 71 builds to be a failure.<br />
<br />
Fel Flame's role is for situations where you have to move a lot, or possibly in situations where you don't have time to get multiple dots up. We don't anticipate it becoming a rotational ability for any warlock.<br />
<br />
None of this is to say that talent trees and possibly even rotations won't be changing. I'm pretty excited with the current state of the Cataclysm warlock talent trees. We've fixed up some awkward parts and come up with some cool mechanics. Hopefully we can share them soon.

Wow that's weird.. so &quot;melee haste&quot; will be incorporated into attack speed?<br />

Thrall has blue eyes, and it looks like that orc has brown eyes.<br />
<br />
In any case, the banner is ripped and the pole is broken, so he seems to be holding it as a trophy, not a personal banner.</div></div><hr />

Could be a reference to Minsc from Baldur's Gate. He travelled with a small Hamster called Boo in his pouch. <br />
<br />
&quot;Boo points, I punch - it's a very simple relationship, but it is effective!&quot;<br />
&quot;Minsc will lead with blade and boot! Boo will take care of the details.&quot;<br />
<br />
and of course, my two favourites;<br />
<br />
&quot;He mutters occasionally about fellow hamsters that will kill you all, but he is just moody, so don't worry. See how he glares? Shhh, we should leave him be.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What? Boo is outraged! See his fury! It's small, so look close. Trust me, it's there.&quot;</div></div><hr />

thats because you don't understand that affliction warlocks are forced put 15 or more points in destruction to get ruin because without ruin their shadow bolt is garbage, so every pve affliction warlock puts 15 in destruction and is screwed because they would need 11-15 points in demonology as well to get soul link or fel domination.

On a side note boub uve gone all soft I would have demanded multiple hugs from casey<br />
<br />
EDIT** <br />
I read it wrong blizzard said fel flame not demonbolt, i swear warlocks are getting a spell called demonbolt wasn't that released in the new spells blue post?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes but it seems to be more like the demonology equivalent of chaos bolt instead of a new filler spell like people were thinking...</div></div><hr />

Awwww, that's the only reason I watch that show anymore. I usually just skip to the end where Uncle Casey's Mailbag starts. I often think it's quite funny some of things people write in about. :P</div></div><hr />

Also a little potential &quot;hint&quot; about beta... in the section of blue posts about Warlocks in Cataclysm and the &quot;fixed&quot; trees...<br />

Mmo-report was awesome as usual, and I thought that we'd use Fel flame in our rotations, since it refreshes Immo/UA and probably deals more damage? (atleast more than UA, since UA doesn't deal any direct damage).</div></div><hr />

thats because you don't understand that affliction warlocks are forced put 15 or more points in destruction to get ruin because without ruin their shadow bolt is garbage, so every pve affliction warlock puts 15 in destruction and is screwed because they would need 11-15 points in demonology as well to get soul link or fel domination. Does your stupid rogue or mage have to spend 15 points in every tree as well ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, warlocks aren't the only ones forced to put so many points in a tree (18 for Blood Caked Blade for DKs, to name one talent, or 11 for Icy Veins for arcane mages), so I don't really think that's an argument that stands. However, I always did find it obscure an Affliction lock had to go 15 points for a single, filler nuke (while Blood Caked Blade and Icy Veins have much more general purposes than benefitting one single nuke that's not even considered to be part of your tree), but that was the way the destruction tree was built and it's difficult to change that all around just for the sake of making it feel less obscure for a single spec. That said, Affliction is not underpowered at all, so why would we need to pick up Fel Armor? Would it be any more fun to spend that many points in Demo instead of in Destro (13 points, of which only 3 benefits our dps and 3 others can be considered somewhat useful? If anything I personally find it retarded that as Destro, I need to spend so many useless talent points in Demo, points I'd much, much rather spent elsewhere (especially when under the hitcap) just to get Demonic Aegis. I wouldn't mind those pointless talents if my original tree felt &quot;done&quot; (as in, there's not much else to pick up anyway), but somehow for me Destro never feels &quot;done&quot;.<br />
<br />
So both way around, Destruction and Affliction, in my opinion, the second tree I go into feels kind of weird and obsure. Again, that's probably very personal. The point being though it works and is balanced in the sense that though we may not be top dps, we're not even close to the position shadow priests were for most of this expansion. That gives Blizzard little motivation to make such drastic changes so late in the expansion and I'm fine with that. I love this class regardless of awkward trees.<br />
<br />
Which brings hope for Cataclysm, since they're revamping all the trees and talents and Ruin is essentially a 'boring' talent, it may well be going away, or else be replaced by something else. They already admitted the warlock trees are awkward on several points, so I think we can expect some major overhauls. Also, we will be spending more points in offtrees in Cataclysm, so even in the unlikely case Ruin stays the same in Cata, 15 points in Destruction won't be all that strange or feel that weird.</div></div><hr />

Hehehe, well I agree with you, though. If Cataclysm comes out without Blizzard updating the models some things are just going to look disgusting. I find it bad enough looking at something like a Night Elf and then a Draenei. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />
