<br />
I don't think its unreasonable to want higher iLevel drops from seasonal bosses. Blizzard already has done it with a 226 BOE from Beerfest. Now that casuals can pick up 245s from heroics, its certainly not unreasonable to let them get a few more 226s from the occasional seasonal events. iLevel 200 is sort of a joke at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got two brooms - one rare, one uncommon.<br />
<br />
The uncommon broom is 14 days.<br />
<br />
The rare broom does not have a time limit on it but 'requires hallows end'.<br />
<br />
The rare broom will fly in flyable zones, but if you have to remount when you leave Dalaran (eg) as the flying property is decide based on where you mount it.<br />
<br />
Sadly, they didn't make the rare broom unique (assuming I am right about it not hacving a time limit), as people were continuing to roll for it after they'd won one.<br />
<br />
The mount also don't become 'spells' like other mounts but remain in your inventory.</div></div><hr />

It certainly looks it (126k health and all), but it's not necessarily in your interest as you get one chance at loot rather than 5 in a full group. Of course, there's no competition but most of the items drop quickly enough anyhow.</div></div><hr />

If it was really a &quot;simple holiday boss&quot; why bother even updating it to level 80?<br />
<br />
People complain because Direbrew ended up having a ilevel 226 1H BoE Mace that made the event actually worth running long after you got a mount or remote or whatever you were in there for. Even though the trinkets were ilevel 200, they still saved alts around 40 Conquest badges considering how you don't really have any other good options for trinkets unless you're getting carried through raids. Meanwhile, this holiday is dropping ilevel 200 rings, about on par with drops from Heroic Gundrak, but worth far less than the rings you can buy with the emblems that currently drop from Heroic Gundrak.</div></div><hr />

People would have bitched if they didn't update him. People are bitching now because they are &quot;only&quot; getting ilvl 200 equipment from it. People would be bitching if it dropped ilvl 298 gear...welcome to the forums and the internet. The argument that &quot;another holiday dropped higher level gear&quot; is just as valid as the &quot;I raided for my higher level gear&quot; argument people use against badge stuff. Is one more valid than the other or are they both equally retarded in the long run? The 226 mace was added mid event...so if your concern is over a lack of &quot;reason to go back long after you got a mount&quot;...maybe we should wait a few days before we all have a panic attack.</div></div><hr />

This is a Holiday GIFT to US, how can you even begin to complain about something that's been given as a gift, I bet you're one of those rotten kids who complain every Christmas for not getting what your friends got. Be happy you have something else to do besides farm heroics all day for your welfare epics.<br />

The ring was kara equivalent kara being the lowest teir of gear. This year naxx being the lowest. Although kara was a 10 man. It sucked last year and does this year as well. I mean why would I keep holiday gear in my bank just because. I didnt wear it last year and I dont need to again this year. Kind of sad holiday bosses are just a joke. They should be fun and bring upgrades that people can actually use not just crap.</div></div><hr />

People are bitching now because they are &quot;only&quot; getting ilvl 200 equipment from it. People would be bitching if it dropped ilvl 298 gear...welcome to the forums and the internet. The argument that &quot;another holiday dropped higher level gear&quot; is just as valid as the &quot;I raided for my higher level gear&quot; argument people use against badge stuff. Is one more valid than the other or are they both equally retarded in the long run? The 226 mace was added mid event...so if your concern is over a lack of &quot;reason to go back long after you got a mount&quot;...maybe we should wait a few days before we all have a panic attack.<br />
The mace was &quot;added&quot; mid-event even though Blizzard had promotional ads for buying the Mug o' Terror all over the forums? Unlikely.<br />

No one is having a panic attack here. It's just disappointing.</div></div><hr />

i think ppl mostly complain about the items being crap compared to brewfest boss, which gave badge trinkets (that are decent) and a trinket with ALOT of stamina which many tanks liked, while these items currently arent that good for any1 except some 1h sword users(who??) and plate wearers(plate helm) aswell as no tank items</div></div><hr />

The sword is decent for a combat rogue who just dinged 80, and doesn't want to shell out 1k for the mug from the last event, but that's about it. But yeah, still pretty terrible.</div></div><hr />

You don't think they have enough metrics from Brewfest to know what people want/expect from HH? You don't think that people have been making threads since the FIRST HH about how they want more than a plate helm so others can have the nifty on use effect?<br />
<br />
I'm failing to understand why anymore time should be given, when they've had all the time in the world already.<br />
<br />
Granted, I'll still kill HH for the mount, and I will still enjoy the event, I just think it's ludicrous to expect much to change when they already chose not to give a wider variety of loot.</div></div><hr />

I don't know. I guess that every holiday doesn't have to be the exact same shit. Kill boss for mount and uber-ish gear would be a little lame for every holiday. Besides, even the stuff that coren dropped was shit.</div></div><hr />

Naw, QQing would require one or more of the following.<br />
<br />
1) Using all caps.<br />
2) Making up words.<br />
3) Using strange conjunctions and abbreviations of words that are not hard to type.<br />
4) Over usage of exclamation marks.<br />

My boyfriend and I duo'd it easily, cycling through our alts.

According to the latest comment on the item on Wowhead (posted one hour or so ago), no. You MUST LOOT the item to get the achievement.</div></div><hr />

I can confirm that you have to loot it. I actually thought of trading it earlier, so we tried it, and no achievement. Luckily, 2 more helms dropped afterwards so it wasn't much of an issue, since only 3 of us wants the achievement anyway.</div></div><hr />

I mean that the Headless Horseman's &quot;Horrific&quot; Helm - should at least be ilvl 226 (same as t8.5) <br />
since u already can get that for.. yeah almost free (58 Emblems of Conquest). <br />
<br />
The Horseman's Baleful Blade - ilvl should be the same as ToC (5) normal drop, which indeed is 200. So that is okay.<br />
And the rings should be atleast ilvl 213 as the ones you can buy for Emblem of Valor (25 emblems).<br />
<br />
+ they should add a tank ring. (I know there wasnt any at 70 either, but yea.. it definitely should've been one)<br />
Then its fine. No overpower ilvl.. just one that seems okay and normal.<br />
<br />
And no, I personally dont need any of the items I stated above... but that ilvl is at least logical.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canopus</div><div class="date">2009-10-18, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow. I truly hope this isn't it as far as loot is concerned. Blizzard did an excellent job on upgrading Coren Direbrew this year to meet with Lv 80 characters. Now, the fight was easy. The loot that dropped was very appealing. Especially with all those Tankard O'Terrors you can still see in most AH's. At least those items were of or around Lv226.<br />
<br />
Granted, I haven't actually done any of the Headless Horseman kills yet today. But, if that loot table is reading right, it's going to be mostly vanity stuff this year. Lv 200 items, are you kidding me? The only things worth going after are the mount, if it still exists, and the Squashling pet. <br />

One other thing. Does anyone remember that optional boss in Karazhan last year? The one that dropped the &quot;axe&quot;? :) I wondered if he's part of the whole Hallow's End this year, or was it just a one time deal? Or could he possible be part of the &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; event after Hallow's End is over? I'd like to get that Bat pet again :)</div></div><hr />

Fairly certain he was part of the Scourge invasion; the minipet you get for killing him is a Feat of Strength.</div></div><hr />

with my paladins team(5) and shamans(4)+pala tank<br />
<br />
confirmed all drops (ofc) hehe. ++ commons are casters rings. just 1 sword and 1 helm.<br />
rare quality mount (got 6) and 1 rare pet.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
hitted 27 times: 2nd helm, many rings drop. 2nd pet, no mount, a couple of new(for me) rare quality cloth &quot;Hallowed Helm&quot;, useful for achievement &quot;Sinister Calling&quot; (requires hallowed helm and pet sinister squashling)</div></div><hr />

The reason they don't give drop percentages is because THEN we would have people bitching about the math, instead of whining about wanting to see the percentage. <br />

I've done the HH over 60 times so far, around 30 this year alone, and I've only seen the mount drop once. And I won it :)<br />
<br />
For that reason, I sincerely hope the mount drop rate is incredibly low. At least it has som worth, and players are as happy to see it as I am to own it. <br />
<br />
I've seen a couple players with it too, meaning for the huge amount of players actively farming this, on 3-4 alts most, the drop rate is pleasently low. <br />
<br />
Well, at the minute anyway. I hope Blizz don't increase it. EVERYBODY and his brother has a Kodo now. :(</div></div><hr />

Dunno if anyone mentioned it yet but it doesnt bug. You can do it twice if you have the pre quest. You can only do it twice once, if that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

But anyway, I was lucky enough to get the headless horseman's mount the last day of Hallow's End last year, so this year is all about farming for my boyfriend!

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slife</div><div class="date">2009-10-19, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok so after reading 11 pages of ppl saying 'they drops are dissappointing', all i have to say is.... dude go raid.<br />
<br />
i mean seriously, good gear drops from:<br />
nax 25 (ya some of that gear is still ok to get and easy to down in 2 hours)<br />
ulduar<br />
ToTC<br />
Onyxia<br />
<br />
... and some ppl want leet ass gear to drop from a lvl 80 holiday boss with 126K health??? we all can agree that blizzard made epics easier to get over the years, but thinkining they SHOULD give you the most awesome gear .... from a holiday??<br />
<br />
the holiday is meant to be fun and give VANITY gear. of course the rings arent visual on your toon but the helm, sword, both mounts, and pet are. thats what the holiday is here for. not to gear up your noob asses and expect ppl will take you seriously in holiday epics when you want to do ice crown.<br />
<br />
so do yourselves a favor, quit expecting gear to be handed to you, go raid (or pvp even), and do the HH with me so i can use ur daily quests for a better shot at that mount kk?<br />
<br />
and the event JUST started... give it time, maybe something will happen... and if it doesnt, who cares? you might get a sweet looking helm that laughs or a sword that spawns an army of pumpkins (pumpkins vs army of the dead, omg someone do it and post it on youtube)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You appear to be pigeon holing me into the group of people on here that QQ about everything. You are wrong. <br />
<br />
I am very happy with the drop rate. I know, I am truly lucky, A) to have had the opportunity to roll, and B) to win the aforemention roll. <br />
<br />
I had no problem with the drop rate before I had the mount, And I have no issue witht he drop rate now that I have it. <br />
<br />
Personally, It nice in these times of Free Epics, (something I have taken nice advantage of on my alts btw, before you QQ), Cheap and early mounts, and accesible content for all, that a few items still have a little prestige. I am actively farming Sulfuras for that very reason.</div></div><hr />
