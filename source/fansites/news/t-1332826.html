Classes<br />
what 3 spell abilities do you feel were spread too much? imo:1. MS 2. Pets 3. CC (close with dots).<br />
For me, 1. MS, 2. Interrupts, 3. Cast while moving. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368445973896261632))<br />
<br />
Do you think that now that classes have similar toolkits, players fixate on small dps/hps deltas more now?<br />
Yes. 200% used to be the &quot;unacceptable&quot; delta. Then it became 30%. Now maybe 10% or less. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366286379090575360))<br />
<br />
Why are warrior/DK buffs still 5 min duration? Other class buffs are always-on passives or 60 mins. There a reason?<br />
They also provide resources so the intent is supposed to be you use them fairly frequently. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368393111958863872))<br />
Isn't this just adding to bloat? A 5-min standard buff, even granting resources, is just another bind. Does it add flavor?<br />
We could turn all buffs into passive like Trueshot Aura. Is that better for the game? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368447726976921600))<br />
<br />
We know, now we are just scared that this will be nerfed. As last time you buffed swp it did not last too long.<br />
The trick is not to view in progress patch notes as final. You can't lose something you technically never had. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367874432213073920))<br />
<br />
While I understand different healers are ok to have different reliance on spirit, how far do you think that should go?<br />
The less Spirit users should not be able to just stack throughout stats and then outheal the more Spirit users. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367874122136571904))<br />
<br />
You have the numbers. I'm sure there's more than MM too. No reason to bring a SP vs a mage/lock in 5.2 progression though.<br />
Mage and lock ended up being too good in 5.2. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367386113125523456))<br />
<br />
Why? Valid argument is valid by definition. Tell us what to focus on. Millions of players, use us to make your job easier.<br />
Players as a collective are always going to want more changes than the game can handle. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366718960504274944))<br />
Would you be excited about 200 pages of patch notes for 5.4? As a player, I would find that really intimidating. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366719051638120448))<br />
And typically you can't just focus on your class. You often need to know how other classes changed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366719132319744000))<br />
So even when arguments are good, we're often not going to make a change unless we think it's pretty important. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366719263421116416))<br />
<br />
Then why did Warlocks get such massive changes, then? Constantly hearing &quot;Hunters are fine&quot; from the devs gets old.<br />
It was an experiment. Warlocks consistently among the least popular classes. Wanted to see if big changes changed that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366713819185168384))<br />
Probably too early to tell still, but we're not sure it had much effect and we probably lost some locks over the changes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366713913192099841))<br />
One the other hand, hunters have consistently been among the most popular, so more risk if we overhauled them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366714043928543233))<br />
Consider we still get a fair amount of feedback that focus, ammo, min range and aspect changes were bad. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366714532384616449))<br />

Ooooo goodie!! ... Wait... Does it include any Feral stuff? You know since we're totally confused about what's going on!<br />
No major new Feral changes in the blog. ATM we also think their damage in 5.4 is also fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365938560399970305))<br />
<br />
Lore said you were planning on giving Spriests and Boomkins active mitigation abilities. Where is this ability?<br />
This was a miscomm somewhere along the line. We meant that mitigation was too high not that we wanted to swap passive for active. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365935804180213762))<br />
<br />
You had said you were getting rid of passive Dmg reduction in turn for cooldowns will balance get any? Barkskin is weak.<br />
No, we said we were getting rid of passive damage reduction on some of the ranged specs. They felt too tanky to us. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367810260834078720))<br />
(And we understand those of you playing those specs disagree.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367810374084485121))<br />
<br />
Instead of nerfing the Balance T16 4Set because we were being capped on SS procs, why not consider letting SS procs stack to N<br />
We considered that, but it procs so fast we thought you'd never be able to burn through all the stacks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364952064389951490))<br />
<br />
Can you actually give some insight into the Balance change and whether you will compensate? to calm the masses.<br />
On the PTR we were seeing a rotation with almost no Starfire or Wrath usage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367348191017971712))<br />

I'm sorry if this was already answered but was readiness removal for hunters needed for pve or pvp reasons?<br />
In this case, both. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/366278620961972224))<br />
<br />
(my reply was referring to general hunter nerfs i've read about. not the idea about applying dot via arcane shot.)<br />
I just meant we're not thrilled with the idea of hunters bringing the perceived best MS if it's easy to apply from range. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364599751812984832))<br />
I don't get it. It's baked into warrior attacks why not bake it into hunter ones? what exactly is the diff?<br />
Range. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365568814290702336))<br />
given how many distance closers you've given warriors (and melee in general) it's pretty easy for them to apply ms as well<br />
Good. It was originally their ability. If anyone needs the best MS, it should be warriors. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365946562234417154))<br />

on subject of mages, an you guys do something new with arcane mastery next xpac? And their kit as well?<br />
Unlikely. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365949918864609280))<br />
<br />
on the subject of mages, an you guys come up with something better mastery wise for the next xpac? Thought passive dmg was bad<br />
What is a spec that you think has a good mastery? I ask bc some players want passive dps, while others want procy mechanics. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365949792293109760))<br />
<br />
is the reasoning for fire nerfs to force us to play another spec because you &quot;worked so hard on frost mastery&quot;.<br />
No. Fire's damage was just unacceptably high in our 5.4 testing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367377754485829632))<br />
Combustion was a good thing to hit since it causes such huge swings based on perfect timing and a little luck. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367377834416672768))<br />
I don't play Fire, so I have no axe to grind. You are aware that currently combustion is doing 100% of ignite dmg though ?<br />
Yeah, just a bug. It isn't worth delaying every PTR build until we catch every bug, or we'd release far fewer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367808214122778624))<br />
<br />
I mean I get how insanely hard fire is to balance without killing lower ilvls. Maybe time for a redesign?<br />
As I mentioned in the blog, we have concerns about Critical Mass and AT + Combustion that we'd like to solve eventually. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367376331182309376))<br />

Not a mention of revival, why do you think it's so strong that it deserves to hit for what a TFT uplift does?<br />

The reason paladins are so high is borked scaling. Too weak at low or no vengeance but OP at high veng. Examine.<br />
We don't really see them weak at low V and only a problem in &quot;I'll tank it all mode&quot; which should be fixed now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364610684836773888))<br />
<br />
It feels like the EF mastery nerf was intended to redirect us to SH or SS but it's ending up as a mastery nerf instead<br />
We'd be open to buffing mastery. We don't like the gameplay of using a hot to constantly refresh it though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367374337080176640))<br />
<br />
It has felt like we've been given tools then had them arbitrarily taken away because of a vision we don't have access to<br />
You have EF. We just thought the interaction between EF and mastery was a bit degenerate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367376969949655040))<br />
Which is why I have a hard time with the &quot;now paladins don't have an identity because we can't roll bubbles with hots.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367377088296124416))<br />
My hope is that anyone who has stuck with us for very long would understand why that violated our design intent on many levels. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367377257624379393))<br />
<br />
Again we hear that EF doesn't fit the style you want for holy without saying what style you want. Help?<br />
EF is fine to use. If every paladin uses it, it is no longer fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367352298457927680))<br />

I don't feel that claim holds water. We admit when we're wrong all the time. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/368398658057695232))<br />
<br />
Players argued that spriest needed buffs. Devs crunch numbers and buff spriests. Players were right.<br />

I have no reason to doubt you. Still, 10-man is the majority of groups, and atm shadow doesn't fit well.<br />
In 10s, I am pretty sure there are more Shadow priests raiding than Fury and Ret combined. They are fitting in somewhere. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367382832068321280))<br />
In 10s lots of Rets went Prot b/c Prot is OP w/ same gear. Look at diff in Ret representation between 10s and 25s.<br />
Not sure that's true. We agree Prot is too good on live, but some Rets just want to be Rets. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367386550843088896))<br />

In my dreams I see SW:P buffs and castable-while-moving Mindflays. I'm so happy here in my dreams, but is it time to wake up?<br />
SW:P is a good place to buff if we conclude they need it. Mind Flay on the move would be too good. You'd be very mobile. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940502127841284))<br />
We could do a Spiritwalkers treatment, but really everyone with Spiritwalkers is just more class homogenization. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940620973449218))<br />
We'd rather Shadow just be strong in other places if they're weaker on the move. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940703408304129))<br />
Agree moving Flay is too good. Maybe turn Spike into a shadowy Scorch/Fel Flame?<br />
Possibly, but does every caster need a Scorch analogue like every melee has a Kick clone? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365982595105816576))<br />
Overall, we're worried we have been too kind with the &quot;but I need X ability&quot; to the point of class over-similarity. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365982889835368448))<br />
I guess as long as you refrain from strengthening class niches people are going to ask for equal tools<br />
But if class niches are too strong, that's not cool either. Leads to class stacking etc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365994056213463042))<br />

Sp community quiet because a lot of them were asked to go disc.Shadow utility and dps in bad place<br />
Skeptical. Shadow is one of the most popular DPS specs for raiding. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365274471315156995))<br />
Rep doesn't tell you everything but it can help tell if someone is being benched. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365274668904615940))<br />
So we have to be underrepresented before you consider bringing Shadow on par (Single Tar.) with other casters?<br />
I was just arguing against the questionable claim that we get little Shadow feedback because they were all asked to respec. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365567145763016704))<br />
I guess because most Theorycrafters addressed you once and then said &quot;He has the data, his move.&quot; instead of mass QQing.<br />
Shadow vs. e.g. hunters or Elemental in 5.2. looks pretty good. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365600291065839616))<br />
And we believe the data suggests Shadow is competitive except against locks and mages, whose DPS is too high. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365600190662590464))<br />
You keep saying lock and mage dps is too high yet you do nothing to adjust that. You might aswell buff Shadow.<br />
If we hotfix buffs to everyone else, then you can suddenly beat all the content quickly and there is no progression. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940060639596544))<br />
If we hotfix nerfs to outlier specs, it risks a group being unable to beat a boss they previously had on farm. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365939979463045120))<br />
Obviously those are two extremes and we do make adjustments despite the risks, but we want to be careful. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365940157649657857))<br />

Neither do I. I've never said broken, just +10% undertuned vs our direct raid spot competition.<br />
Priests looking for more competitive damage in 5.4 should be happy. The ones with long lists of mechanic redesigns will not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365949000479817728))<br />
<br />
So its main reason why Shadow just ignored? I like shadow but you force me to reroll<br />
If you think Shadow is horribly flawed, you're likely looking for something different out of the spec than we are. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365568166836965377))<br />
When you completely gut a spec in PvP and give no compensation, Expect a plethora of tweets and complaints.<br />

Lore said you were planning on giving Spriests and Boomkins active mitigation abilities. Where is this ability?<br />
This was a miscomm somewhere along the line. We meant that mitigation was too high not that we wanted to swap passive for active. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365935804180213762))<br />

Why play shadow when everything else has an advantage over it. Those who played it for years tell you and u brush them off.<br />
It's one of those cry wolf deals where we hear so regularly how all 34 specs are doomed that it just becomes background noise. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365929757042413569))<br />
FWIW, the most common mistakes we see are downplaying your own spec's advantages or comparing yourself to an overpowered spec. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365929933396115459))<br />

Binding recuperate to a single spec would be very bad news for rogues <br />
Remember, that was a totally off the cuff example of how rogues could change. It's nowhere near an announcement, (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364600329142153216))<br />

Misunderstood your post. It was interesting to utilize another finisher. Being forced 2 keep Slice/Recup up sucked<br />
Yeah, for sure. One pitch is to parcel out Rupture, SnD and Recup, but maybe that is still too similar of a maintain X feel. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364879254690865153))<br />
How about,all specs keeps slice and rupture, but focus on adding exciting moves with short cooldowns,or limited use?<br />
So many rogues complain about SnD maintenance that giving them an opt out would be nice. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364956951731376128))<br />

One question: Why 10 seconds on Evasion now?<br />
We thought the &lt;100% was too RNG (you can almost count on it but not quite). But the duration at 100% felt too long with Prep. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364616156033720320))<br />

And you are happy with rogue population too, cause thay are falling down??? Changes need to hapen cause thay are outdated...<br />
They have been dropping almost since launch. We've looked at the issue a lot, and two things seemed to hasten the decline. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364607997525237760))<br />
First, it became harder to gank someone from stealth in the world. Second, we introduced DKs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364608115733315584))<br />
In any case, we're not sold on the idea that overhauling rogues leads to a population increase. Not sure that worked for locks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/364608281454452736))<br />

Looking at the 1st round of DPS tuning: Are you guys intending assassination to shine again in execute range? If so, thanks!<br />

Hey, was healing on my shaman again on PTR. Could you please rethink stacking Earth Shields?! Huge QoL issue, seems outdated.<br />

I don't get why shamans were the only class to get all nerfs and no buffs this update...I feel a tad sick right now.<br />
You'll be fine. If that's your reaction to patch notes, you might be obsessing about patch notes a smidge too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367873927822860288))<br />
<br />
Then revert the healing rain change. Pretty sure that falls under the &quot;but mah niche&quot; buff section<br />
The problem for Shaman was that they had big weaknesses in ranged or movement fights. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367375591126728704))<br />
We'd rather offset a weakness (assuming it isn't debilitating) rather than remove that weakness. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367375683518869504))<br />

Concerning Stormblast and Elemental Blast, why not give them the Colossus Smash treatment instead of affecting sustained PVE?<br />
We were concerned about Elemental DPS being too high in PvE as well. The numbers aren't final though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367808643900522496))<br />

Hey GC please reassure me the Enhancement tweaks are bad data mining by MMOC ?<br />
No, their damage was too high in both PvP and PvE. We nerfed SS largely because there have 30 different damage sources. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367372168885059585))<br />

remove heroic strike coz now specially after hamstring buff its useless , remove Op stack , stacking op is really boring.<br />
HS may not have a role for Arms anymore. Fury and Prot use it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365930300565495808))<br />
Why the push to remove HS all the sudden? Unless you make Slam take its place, HS IS essential to rage managemt<br />
Only for brief periods IMO. Usually it was at X gear level, you now have rage to spam HS as well as your normal rotation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365950991004213248))<br />
We think more rage management is more fun, but we have to balance that with players who want to fill every GCD. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365951198261547008))<br />
If you are GCD limited it's hard to also be resource limited. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365951251420164097))<br />
But without HS, at those X gear levels, you'd have no way to bleed that rage. Would feel bad to sit at 100 rage all the time.<br />
Not disagreeing. I'm saying rage management needs to be a core piece of gameplay not something you gear out of. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365953505535598594))<br />
Before the MoP rage changes, warriors were rage starved until X, then overpowered and felt understandably they had earned it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365953771651612673))<br />
But then it sucked to be a warrior before X, and sucked to be everyone else after. Not a stellar design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365953906724966401))<br />
Due to the HR glyph, using Shield Block is defensively AND offensively best. HS is in a pretty dire spot.<br />
We'd agree but there are several examples of this when we considered tank dps more optional so made glyphs for it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365992920655986689))<br />
The logic is that survival glyphs are mandatory, but these days tank dps is Kind of a Big Deal, so they aren't optional either. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365993068081582080))<br />
<br />
coz its not Op , or buff Ms damage , slam is not the way to make warrior good , it will hurt pvp and pve for most , you like .<br />
It's tough with Arms (PvE and PvP) to keep either OP or Slam from being ignored. With more OP dmg you might not Slam at all. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365930615494803457))<br />
But if Slam does too much damage, you just save all rage for it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/365930674085040130))<br />
<br />
Is it possible to just see Sunder Armor become a part of CS for 5.4? I don't think I have pushed this button all xpac.<br />
Not for 5.4 but maybe eventually we'll just merge it with Devastate and CS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367874251501490176))<br />
<br />
I like the concept of Meat Cleaver. It's just that Cleave has no part in our AOE rotation. Too much rage cost, too little dmg.<br />
We could cut Cleave and just let you WW and RB. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367385904739926016))<br />
<br />
Most warriors I know don't have it on their hotbar even. Second point: Fury aoe feels clunky at best. Anything to smooth it up<br />
Hmm. We really like Fury AE. Meat Cleaver is fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367368443491659777))<br />
<br />
So, how serious were you about removing Cleave? I'd think only prot warriors would complain as they actually use it.<br />
It's an iconic spell and one warriors have had forever, but if it is superfluous, it's hard to justify. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367810519387738112))<br />
<br />
making Thunder Clap have no CD for Prot would solve everything, allow us to get agro on pack of mobs all the time<br />
So would a no CD Challenging Shout, but we don't want to take all the skill out of tanking. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367348642740314112))<br />
you mean mocking banner.cause banner doesnt fixate big adds and bosses. again.fixate not taunt.<br />
No, I actually meant CS. The idea is to give tanks tools and let them use them, not to make it trivial to do anything. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367374714525589506))<br />
Back when threat control was trickier, there was a place for CS. These days threat is easy. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367374830099640320))<br />

<br />
Can I ask why, when Arms Warriors need sustained damage buffs, you buff slam and not MS/OP?<br />
Common feed we hear is all the attacks feel about the same. We think Slam can hit harder w/out the rotation just being Slam spam. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367346498171711488))<br />
DW buff = sustained damage. BTW I've always thought OP should be free, Slam as rage dump with HS emergency rage dump<br />
OP didn't work well as free because it let warriors ignore all rage generation but MS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367369330758938624))<br />
<br />
Are you after a rotation where Slam is better than Overpower under Colossus Smash? Bank rage for SD so HS dies?<br />
I wouldn't use HS much as Arms unless you need a hit ASAP for some reason or have tons of rage from e.g. Zerk stance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367364383355043840))<br />
<br />
how do you intend Slam to function in the Arms rotation in 5.4?<br />
It does more damage during CS, so in PvE use it then. In PvP you can use it anytime you need a big hit and have the rage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/367363686416912384))<br />

It does not matter? Time grows short, and hunters still have 0 buffs. official or datamined. nothing.<br />
Almost every bossfight have adds and/or burst phases SoO - we are weak on both.<br />

So the damage buffs to the signature moves aswell as a buff to arcane shot damage (with a cost nerf) in the official notes are nothing then? Since I count atleast 3, one to each spec, seriously read before posting.<br />
<br />
On another note, the number passes arent even finished yet so being worried about raid spots is incredibly premature.</div></div><hr />

Those buffs are not enough. Arcane Shot was previously buffed to 150% weapon damage at a cost of 50% more focus, so it just got a major nerf. It does a lot to cause focus starvation as well as getting stuck in a Cobra/Steady Shot when more potent abilities come off cooldown.<br />
<br />
Beast Mastery and MM need a lot of help. SV needs a slight bit of help. Both T16 set bonuses are pretty awful and should have been reworked. Deterrence needs to be affected by CTHD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try actual math. <br />
Kill command buff is less than 2% overall damage buff,<br />
Arcane shot is NERF - damage increase from 110% -&gt; 125%(13% buff), BUT 50% focus increase is HUGE? HUGE, HUGE!!!<br />
Here goes you &lt;2%.. more actually! <br />
<br />
They moved damage from arcane to signatures, that is all! NOTHING more. Slight nerf overall! <br />
<br />
Please, try hunters on PTR before post more nonsense.<br />
Seriously use brain before posting! <br />
---<br />
<br />
+ Arcane shot focus increase will break hunters in a LOT of situations as well, mostly on quick target switch.<br />

<br />
On top of that, they buff rogues, HUGE buff.<br />
They are already top dps spec + they got strong utility for pure dps.<br />

They buffed a dead spec to try and convince people that it's worth playing. Assassination might be near the top, but combat is nowhere near &quot;top dps spec&quot;, which is what the Vitality buff covers (which is what you're flipping out about). I can tell you right now, that even with that buff, I'm still not touching combat with a 10 foot pole. The spec feels bad, it IS bad, and they need to address all of the other problems that combat suffers from. <br />
<br />
All this buff says is, &quot;We don't know how to fix it, so, here's a flat damage buff&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Lol! Really, wtf people? are you blind or just skip whatever pleases you? <br />
Miss assassination buff?<br />
Assassin's Resolve buff? 5% on top on 125 = 4% buff overall.<br />
<br />
Why not buff other classes who really need those 4 % ? instead blizzard just buff &quot;top dps spec&quot;.<br />
Why????????<br />

Assiassinations got HUGE buff..<br />
Fan of knifes,<br />
Sinister strike, <br />
Assassin's Resolve,<br />
Mutilate.<br />
<br />
Its more than 10% overall, not just 4%!!!!<br />
<br />
I don't get this.. Assassinations is BEST melle spec atm. little behind mages and locks.</div></div><hr />

No, I didn't miss it. The 5% damage buff to Assassination is an attempt to make up for how truly horrible melee is going to be in Siege of Orgrimmar. Hop on PTR, or even watch some streams, and tell me how many people are in the top 10 of a given fight.<br />
<br />
They don't want to Dragonsoul us where melee just get a flat AP buff, so they're giving out incremental buffs. The strongest spec had it's passive damage ability go from +25% to +30%. Hooray. I'd express more excitement, but that's all I can muster.<br />
<br />
Rogues are, and have traditionally been, the &quot;top pure DPS spec&quot; because of their lack of raid utility. You bring a rogue for their damage, period. With the Smoke Bomb utility added, that isn't true anymore. We're allowed to be middle of the pack. We are currently, and we will be in the future. There are fights where we will be top, there will be fights where we're mid, and there will be the insanely melee-unfriendly fights where we will be at the &quot;top of the bottom&quot;, which will consist of all the melee at the bottom of the meters.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry your class, whatever it is, didn't get a buff (yet). To cry doomsday and apocalypse scenarios because a -DEAD- spec got a big buff (that still isn't enough to make me or any rogues I know want to actually play it), is a little asinine. Familiarize yourself with the class before you start going on incoherent banters about what you perceive as an overpowered buff.</div></div><hr />

If that's an attempt to make up for how bad melee are, where are all the other melees buffs at? Enhance nerfed, WW nerf, paladin, same-ish, warrior same-ish. Don't be so silly. Just going to be another tier where rogues dominate. I'm sure next you'll tell me all those classes were in fact deserving of those nerfs cause you couldnt keep up with em in damage with your 4 button rotation.<br />
<br />
I Imagine you forgot about these already:<br />
<br />
Assassin's Resolve now increases damage by 30% (up from 25%).<br />
Dispatch now deals 645% weapon damage (up from 460%).<br />
Mutilate now deals 280% weapon damage (up from 200%).<br />
<br />

First. Again, no, I did not forget about other personal buffs that the rogue class has gotten. Believe it or not, I do keep up to speed with things. The numbers pass has just begun, and they have a little over a week to figure out how they want it exactly. I wouldn't even be surprised to see the patch pushed back a week, but they seem hell bent on this release on the 27th. <br />
<br />
Second, I'm not going to get into an e-peen &quot;DPS meters&quot; argument with a random guy on MMO-C. My numbers are fine, and speak for themselves (http://www.wow-heroes.com/character/us/Whisperwind/Daltin/). Let's not get into the argument of who parses more consistently (http://www.wow-heroes.com/character/us/Kel%27Thuzad/Vish/) vs those other classes.<br />
<br />
Frost Deathknights got buffed.<br />
Feral hasn't been touched yet.<br />
Retribution got buffed, I don't know what you're talking about. Guardian being a 3 minute CD now. Inquisition got buffed pretty significantly, too.<br />
Enhancement was indeed nerfed as you mentioned, though I cannot speak from experience as we don't use one. I've heard through the grapevine that Enhancement was pretty strong.<br />
Arms has some buffs and some design changes. Lets ignore Deep Wounds having a +65% damage buff, why don't we? Also, lets ignore B&amp;T increasing Thunder Claps damage by 50% now. <br />
Combat rogue had some significant buffs to try and sway people to actually play the spec, due to it's horrendous representation.<br />
<br />
Assassination. Do you want to know part of the story behind these &quot;buffs&quot;? They're rebalancing our class due to destroying how RPPM trinkets effected our damage output. Juju and Renataki are not going to be the masterpieces they were in 5.3 post-RPPM buff for us like they are now. With them changing how RPPM works, it directly hurt all the melee, but it hurt rogues a lot more than you're assuming.<br />
<br />
We got the same &quot;Siege of Orgrimmar melee buff&quot; that everyone else got, and we got a little something extra to compensate for how shitty our RPPM trinkets are going to be for the first few weeks until we get the new trinkets.<br />
<br />
I understand you're pissed off that Windwalker Monks got completely shit on. Our monk isn't happy about it, either. Every monk I talk to is pissed, and justifiably so. They certainly over-did it on you guys, when in reality you guys were on par with all of the other melee. There will be buffs headed your way, no doubt. They won't let the new class of the new expansion be in the shitter for the last tier of their introductory expansion.<br />
<br />
And seriously, 4 button rotation? Are windwalker monks really in any position to criticize someone else's combat rotation? Tiger Palm, Jab, RSK, BoK. Compelling stuff. And no, Rune of Reorigination does not make Windwalkers exciting. That's why they're breaking it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enhancement currently loses 20% dps compard to live. And Enhancement is worse than assa rogues already.<br />
<br />
Where can this be balancing?<br />
<br />
Yesterday there was some ptr testing and rogues were always p1-p3. And to make it even worse, 50-100% above dps shamans on pretty much every try.<br />
<br />
This isn't balancing, this whole shit is just a complete mess. DPS shamans are currently unplayable, they were behind DKs already before those buffs and now are 20-30% behind rogues/mages/warlocks and 10-15% behind nearly all other melees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the Shaman nerfs are a complete mystery, even more so that Assassination was buffed as well as they other rogue specs (although they arent doing as well). Yes we were strong, we have fantastic burst. Horrible cleave and horrible AoE in the context of ToT (and will remain just as horrible in SoO). We had one saving grace and that was our burst and Single Target DPS - with that being said we were still behind Assassination and Feral, Ret and Warriors were not to far behind us. Melee, apart from Death Knights have been pretty well balanced this tier.<br />
<br />
If Melee are currently facing bias because of the encounters (which they are) nerfing melee is just face palm. Enhance could have been left alone (or slightly buffed with Assassination) and the other melee specs given buffs following suit.<br />
<br />
Right now, these PTR notes are leaving everyone scratching their heads. Ive been testing the Shaman changes on the PTR for the last few days and I just do not know what to think.

I cannot add anythign to what you said. It's perfect.<br />
<br />
Lats night on PTR me and a fellow enhance were ready to just delete our PTR client. Sure we get to test the new bosses, but at what cost ? We're not doing any damage at all. We don't have the healing burst either anymore, so we're just fully neutered. I just can't see how their internal testing showed that enhance / ele were doing 'wayyyy&quot; too much damage to justify these class-destroying nerfs.<br />
<br />
At this rate there will literally be no point taking an enhance shaman to progression fights as we bring nothing but a healing tide and a stormlash, which is fully outclassed by bringing an extra rogue as he'll double our dps and give more raid utility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway i'm tired of the shaman roller coaster and just a lot of stupid balance stuff in game.<br />
They fail to see that everyone gets a package and they always buff/nerf all aspects of a spec when it overperforms.<br />
There will be less than no reason to take an enhancer next tier. bad damage in AoE and ST, no offhealing, less survival than rogues, and resto can drop stormlash also...<br />
Elemental will be nice for resto's off spec when outgearing the place.<br />
<br />
Resto seems really solid though, they might be even better than disco's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it went from 165% to 125% how is that a buff ? they kept the 50% cost increase exactly the same, basically right now on live as is 110% dmg for 20 focus, now it's gonne be 125% for 30 focus, it's a nerf and quite a big one.<br />
<br />
Readiness removal means less BW so less Overal dmg, less AS spam which doesn less dmg now anyway.<br />
<br />
Overal with all the nerfs I lost almost 15k DPS compared to old ptr build and 10K DPS compared to live, the shittiest DPS class get's nerfed into the ground.<br />
The signature shot buffs is nothing, it doesn't even come first on total dmg done and the increased dmg is weak.<br />

They would have to double it's dmg for it even to be neither a dps gain or loss.</div></div><hr />

Actually I do, the rogue buffs are to counter balance the rppm changes since they are a class which is hit quite badly by them, according to our resident rogue. If hunters arent getting sweeping damage buffs initially they are unlikely to get them later.<br />
<br />
Plus, I don't need to use maths to disprove your point that you received 0 buffs which you so stated, 3 =/= 0 unless you mess around with modulus. The buffs may only have a minor effect on DPS but you received buffs despite your statement, and to be perfectly honest I wasn't doing maths for a class I don't pay a whole lot of attention to, I just saw people complaining about no hunter changes when they were 2 news posts down in patch notes regardless of how big they were. <br />
<br />
On the note of utility though, rogues bring... smoke bomb and that is it. I don't know why you consider your utility nothing at all since being able to bring any buff and even hero in BM is considered utility, some of the pets you can have bring utility like the farstrider's AoE armour debuff, what do you want a raid wide damage reduction?.</div></div><hr />

The buffs may only have a minor effect on DPS but you received buffs despite your statement, and to be perfectly honest I wasn't doing maths for a class I don't pay a whole lot of attention to, I just saw people complaining about no hunter changes when they were 2 news posts down in patch notes regardless of how big they were. <br />
<br />
On the note of utility though, rogues bring... smoke bomb and that is it. I don't know why you consider your utility nothing at all since being able to bring any buff and even hero in BM is considered utility, some of the pets you can have bring utility like the farstrider's AoE armour debuff, what do you want a raid wide damage reduction?.<br />
<br />
If you think the only utility rogues bring is smokebomb, you're not playing your class correctly in raids.<br />
<br />
As for the rogue buffs, yeah you guys really needed that huh ? Top of the charts on live, top on the PTR. Rogue just continues to shine with their ridiculously forgiving specs, whereas Enhance has to shit there and continue to be shit. They only thing we had going for us was our offhealing / utility and burst.<br />
<br />
Now that burst has been nerfed to the point we won't even appear top 10 at the start of a fight, our offhealing has gone and our sustained damage is non existent ( I can literally just spam lavalash on cd and do more dps on live than I'm doing wiht my full rotation on PTR. It's horrible, and today's round of PTR changes have made me lose all hope that Enhance will get the buff they so desperately need ( elemental too btw ).</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't it, to some extent, be considered &quot;utility&quot; that rogues can pretty much take care of themselves? At least in terms of a lot of the boss mechanics in T15. Feint coupled with elusiveness I feel has a big impact on the raid damage we take, and being able to ignore abilities with cloak even more so. To my knowledge our own personal cooldowns have a pretty decent impact on both raid damage and DPS time on the boss on at least half of the encounters in ToT. I don't feel rogues are the &quot;pure&quot; dps machines we once were, we have quite a few tricks up our sleeve to make us more attractive in terms of structuring a raid.</div></div><hr />

You talk as if hunters are unaffected by RRPM trinkets and won't suffer any DPS loss from these trinket changes also. We have RRPM stuff too you know, and the fact that this is the 2nd number tuning build, with no hunter buffs, just goes to show you those false promises Blizzard stated about letting us do more DPS than that of 5.3.<br />
<br />
Lets just be clear that there's 2 things on the line here.<br />
<br />
1. Changes to compensate those classes who relied on RRPM trinkets - understandable and welcomed<br />
2. Buffs to classes that were ALREADY performing average/sub-par and not as attractive as higher DPS classes such as Mages and Warlocks (i.e, hunters) *lets not forget utility and the fact that some classes you could say, make up for this with their high DPS<br />
<br />
I think it's safe to say Blizzard may have forgotten #2 and most likely got ahead of themselves with balancing all of the other classes that were already more favorable than Hunters in 5.3. The result is that Hunters will fall behind again since many classes have received flat out, straight up buffs which were most likely related to #1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a holy paladin, so yes I am playing my rogue incorrectly. On the terms of enhance I don't know why they were nerfed quite badly, I can only guess a scaling issue or a PvP issue, and to be honest the amount of offhealing an enhance could do with healing rain and the healing storm glyph was absurd and it was right to be nerfed. Elemental I literally don't get since elemental was behind enhance in the ST department so that one baffles me, again I'm guessing a scaling issue or PvP, which are the usual reasons.<br />

<br />
Well from the scale of the buffs, its safe to say rogue's were more heavily affected than hunters were, but are people going to really keep comparing themselves to mages and warlocks? everyone knows the world will end before we see a mage/warlock even remotely down the pack. As I said before, the numbers pass isn't finished, there are still classes up in arms about their classes not just hunters. Even those who have received buffs still complain it's not enough, but we'll see.</div></div><hr />

Smoke Bomb is a defensive raid cooldown without a damage/player cap. It also gets a shortened cooldown with the new Assurance of Consequence trinket. Rogues have better survivability than just about any other class thanks to feint, cloak, smoke bomb, etc. This survivability allows them to perform tasks like soaking sparks on Will of the Emperor, soaking Corrupted Anima on Ra-den, soaking Anima Rings on Dark Animus and other raid mechanics.<br />
<br />
One thing I personally want is for Bloodlust/Heroism to be a baseline ability. The way I see it, shamans and mages of all specs can bring a very powerful buff, but in order for me to bring it I have to play BM. That's fine, but I often have to pet twist because my 10-man has neither mages nor shaman. The way I see it, 25-man groups are pretty much always going to have Bloodlust/Heroism anyway. 10-man groups are much more likely to be missing multiple buffs. Giving hunters Bloodlust/Heroism as a baseline ability would not affect any relevant forms of PVP either.</div></div><hr />

Well classes that will dominate in 5.4:<br />
<br />
Warlocks and Rogues, later Mages, especially fire mages<br />
<br />
Classes that will perform very well due to Multidotting and be close to teh top:<br />
Shadows, Moonkins<br />
<br />
Classes performing solid due to high single target dps or cleave or execute:<br />
Hunters, ferals, warriors, DKs<br />
<br />
Classes that will suck becuase of weak aoe/cleave/mechanics and mediocre single target:<br />
Both Shaman speccs, retribution palas, windwalker</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where can this be balancing?<br />
<br />
Yesterday there was some ptr testing and rogues were always p1-p3. And to make it even worse, 50-100% above dps shamans on pretty much every try.<br />
<br />
This isn't balancing, this whole shit is just a complete mess. DPS shamans are currently unplayable, they were behind DKs already before those buffs and now are 20-30% behind rogues/mages/warlocks and 10-15% behind nearly all other melees.<br />
<br />
First you said they were 50 to 100% behind rogues, then it was 20%. Which is it?<br />
<br />
Does anyone here actually test, or are we slinging napkin math around? I dont know what streams or ptr testing anyone has done here , but if you're witnessing rogues in the top 3, that speaks to the level of skill of every other player in there, I.e. not good. 3 rogues on the midwinter stream yesterday were barely sniffing the top 10. Why? Is it ranged bias, the health of the class, or both?<br />
<br />
RPPM hits rogues exceptionally hard with the nerf. Based soley on Renataki, I will either be in first after 2 minutes at 400k or 15th at 190k. That is the strength and weakness of rppm. Those 195 pulls become more common after the change. That's why you're seeing a lot of rogue &quot;buffs&quot; which are just counterbalancing the rppm slaughter.</div></div><hr />

Thats great, Enhance also got devastated by the RPPM nerfs. <br />
<br />
Then got gutted to oblivion with the Stormblast, Lava Lash and Stormstrike nerfs. Then to add insult to injury got nerfed again with Fire Elemental.<br />
<br />
I was apart of a raid test this morning and we had a rogue constantly sniffing the top 5 spots. Warlocks dominated coming in first and second every attempt.<br />
<br />
Mages were also scraping in the top 5.<br />
<br />
Ele Shaman was around mid - bottom. Enhance may as well have gone to the toilet, made a drink come back and auto attacked.</div></div><hr />

It was a cleave fight. It's 20% on single target and 50%+ on cleave fights and where rogues can cheat mechanics by using cloak/feint and so on.<br />
<br />
Though i did some testing today on Simcraft and i managed to get my dps something up again, but still dps drops despite of reforging/regemming by 13.4% on patch day for my char. And 13.4% on single target is just terrible, it is the difference between middle of the pack and bottom and totally unnecessary. And it's even more on short fights beause burst got really big nerfs (from 900k to 561k top).</div></div><hr />

I can't believe this is even happening lol, obviously i play a hunter and we have just been shat on. Now our rotation includes a lot more cobra shots because we are focus starved due to them starting off by buffing the arcane shot damage and doubling the focus cost, then removing the damage portion and leaving the high focus cost. Readiness gone due to pvpers crying, slight buffs to our signature shots that are nowhere near enough to bring us to a competitive amount. The only 'good' buffs are stampede back to 100% damage (which we had prior, plus the pets abilities) and the amoc 40% buff (which is worse then live anyway because we cant double up at the start with readiness. I seriously hope they do a PROPER buff before this goes live and not a mid tier (after we have already cleared content) +5% aspect buff again.</div></div><hr />

Don't know about MW's rogues, but our rogue was far and beyond top of the charts doing all 4 bosses yesterday on 25. We merged with another top 40 guild to do our testing and had 2 of each class minimum by luck. Pretty much all of them were paired for dps. Rogues &gt; Everyone</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I just simmed rogue T15 heroic setup and you know what? <br />
<br />
The result before the buff of today was that rogues did about the same dps as before (at least Assa).<br />
219176 -&gt; 218865 ( I don't want to upload the screenshot)<br />
<br />
<br />
And it's possible that Rogues might get even somewhat better by reforging.<br />
And with this change as of today:<br />
Assassination<br />
<br />
Assassin's Resolve While wielding daggers, your maximum Energy is increased by 20 and your damage is increased by 25% 30%. Requires Daggers. Rogue - Assassination Spec.<br />
<br />
Assas will actually gain about 4% damage on patchday WITHOUT gear optimization, while Enhancers in its current PTR state lose 17% without Gear optimization and 13.4% with gear optimazation. So the gap between Assa and enhancers raises by about 17-18%, not to mention that combat cloud be new Nr. 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course it is. When warrios are on the same level single target wise, they tend to dominate all other melees because of mechanics.<br />
<br />
But from yesterdays testing, warriors were clearly the second best melee. All Enhancers, WWs and ferals were without chance against a warrior, though ferals performed a little better.<br />
<br />
But as i see it, they might try to balance all melees except rogues close to each other and rogues 10-15% ahead of all other melees. And this is ridicilous balancing.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that enhancers also lost a lot dps options. They also had a glyph nerf which gave them some extra damage for some fight lengths, this got nerfed. They also got their offhealing cut in half, seriously nerfing their raid support. All of this would be okay for a class that performs really well on PTR.</div></div><hr />

On the note of utility though, rogues bring... smoke bomb and that is it. I don't know why you consider your utility nothing at all since being able to bring any buff and even hero in BM is considered utility, some of the pets you can have bring utility like the farstrider's AoE armour debuff, what do you want a raid wide damage reduction?.<br />
<br />
It's not like they haven't increased the damage of our signatures, but so far our position on the PTR is barely different from where we are on live. Things like moving damage from arcane shot to our signatures is the kind of thing that shouldn't happen in the numbers pass which is used to balance dps, not fix mechanics issues.<br />
<br />
As far as utility goes, don't just be another sheep believing that being able to bring a buff is somehow comparable raid utility to smoke bomb raid wall. EVERYONE brings buffs, and the fact that we get to choose ours makes up for the fact that we bring less buffs/debuffs at once than most every other class in the game. AoE armor reduction is also pretty funny, it has very slow build up taking about a minute just to get to 3 stacks and most AoE mobs are dead by then. But that follows the theme of the hunter class I guess, our utility is things that every other class already brings. Rogues bring attack speed, armor reduction, magical damage weakness and cast speed reduction, while hunters bring trueshot aura and one additional ability from our pet. So which do you think is superior? Rogues bringing 4 buffs/debuffs or hunters bringing 2 buffs/debuffs?</div></div><hr />

Removal of healing rain being used as &quot;raid utility&quot; to heal melee as enhance via nerf to healing storm.<br />
Fire Elemental nerfed a flat 10%. <br />
Lava Lash, Stormstrike - the bread and butter of our constant damage rotation, which is already piss poor, cut by about 18%.<br />
Stormblast cut by the same as the lava lash and Stormstrike.<br />
<br />
And all this after the RPPM nerf, which alone, would have easily brought down Enhancement's dps by a solid chunk.<br />

<br />
You don't understand, enhancers lose 10% dps and don't get compensated at all. They compensated the best melee dps class by far, rogues, 100% for their RPPM nerfs and on top of that, they got a 4-5% dps buff. Enhancers lost 10% via RPPM and lost another 5% via further nerfs.<br />
<br />
So it's now 15% nerf. <br />
<br />
How can a 15% nerf to a middle of the pack spec be justified when top melee spec gets a 4% dps increase???<br />

Don't forget the fire elemental glyph nerf which was very often a solid dps gain. This is on top of the simmed values since they compare non glyphed FE.<br />
<br />
If we were talking about a 3% nerf, the sky wouldn't be falling down. But 15% just is way way too much to stay calm. Especially since raid testing only showed what everyone expected: rogues being far far far far ahead of enhancers. And they still receive another buff to be on the same level like warlocks and mages. Yet, we just feel totally left alone since it's more and more like &quot;Bring the class, not the player&quot;.</div></div><hr />

So I'm guessing Blizzard has already figured out all Ferals are just going to, or have already, switch back to heart of the wild. Which would completely negate the change Blizzard tried to do lol. <br />
Kinda hard to tune Ferals when every parce from 5.3 had them all using DoC. I'm personally happy about it though, it was annoying to watch predatory swiftness procs to then use healing touch to then line up your bleeds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daltin</div><div class="date">2013-08-18, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First and foremost, I'm a melee player. Secondary, I'm a rogue. I don't want rogues to be the only ones to get the buffs, nor do I want any melee to get nerfs.<br />
<br />
I don't give a shit if I'm first in overall DPS, first in melee DPS, or last in melee DPS. I know I play my character at a high level, and I help my guild progress. That's what matters. <br />
<br />
All the shit-slinging that's been going around just isn't necessary. &quot;4 button rotation&quot; comments, and the like.<br />
<br />
I'm not &quot;making excuses&quot; for the reason why they're buffing Rogue, as some suggested. I'm not a dev, I don't make these decisions. All I'm doing is attempting to put real-world application to the number changes, instead of percentage based napkin math. Trying to help those who don't know much about rogues understand why some of the buffs appear to be rather large. I'm aware that they are significant buffs, and will probably be readjusted at another date. I explained what RPPM did to Rogues in particular with the change. <br />
<br />
Everyone jumping my ass &quot;well rogues blahblah, why did WE get nerfed and not you?&quot;. I don't know. I'm not the only rogue in the world. I just so happened to be one that was online when this conversation was taking place. Next time I'll just keep my thoughts to myself and let everyone bitch at eachother. <br />
<br />
I'm just as frustrated you guys got nerfed as you are. Relax a bit, yeah?<br />
<br />
All that being said, I have no idea what they're doing to Enhancement Shamans.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc4ec7d51a68</div><div class="date">2013-08-18, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not like they haven't increased the damage of our signatures, but so far our position on the PTR is barely different from where we are on live. Things like moving damage from arcane shot to our signatures is the kind of thing that shouldn't happen in the numbers pass which is used to balance dps, not fix mechanics issues.<br />
<br />
As far as utility goes, don't just be another sheep believing that being able to bring a buff is somehow comparable raid utility to smoke bomb raid wall. EVERYONE brings buffs, and the fact that we get to choose ours makes up for the fact that we bring less buffs/debuffs at once than most every other class in the game. AoE armor reduction is also pretty funny, it has very slow build up taking about a minute just to get to 3 stacks and most AoE mobs are dead by then. But that follows the theme of the hunter class I guess, our utility is things that every other class already brings. Rogues bring attack speed, armor reduction, magical damage weakness and cast speed reduction, while hunters bring trueshot aura and one additional ability from our pet. So which do you think is superior? Rogues bringing 4 buffs/debuffs or hunters bringing 2 buffs/debuffs?<br />
<br />
And i'm totally okay with rogues being top melee. I just can't think of any reason why the current balancing happened. It's just no fun to do everything perfectly and be last on damage. I think it's also not funny to be always 10% higher because where's the challenge when it's a no brainer.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velshin</div><div class="date">2013-08-18, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First. Again, no, I did not forget about other personal buffs that the rogue class has gotten. Believe it or not, I do keep up to speed with things. The numbers pass has just begun, and they have a little over a week to figure out how they want it exactly. I wouldn't even be surprised to see the patch pushed back a week, but they seem hell bent on this release on the 27th. <br />
<br />
Second, I'm not going to get into an e-peen &quot;DPS meters&quot; argument with a random guy on MMO-C. My numbers are fine, and speak for themselves (http://www.wow-heroes.com/character/us/Whisperwind/Daltin/). Let's not get into the argument of who parses more consistently (http://www.wow-heroes.com/character/us/Kel%27Thuzad/Vish/) vs those other classes.<br />
<br />
Frost Deathknights got buffed.<br />
Feral hasn't been touched yet.<br />
Retribution got buffed, I don't know what you're talking about. Guardian being a 3 minute CD now. Inquisition got buffed pretty significantly, too.<br />
Enhancement was indeed nerfed as you mentioned, though I cannot speak from experience as we don't use one. I've heard through the grapevine that Enhancement was pretty strong.<br />
Arms has some buffs and some design changes. Lets ignore Deep Wounds having a +65% damage buff, why don't we? Also, lets ignore B&amp;T increasing Thunder Claps damage by 50% now. <br />
Combat rogue had some significant buffs to try and sway people to actually play the spec, due to it's horrendous representation.<br />
<br />
Assassination. Do you want to know part of the story behind these &quot;buffs&quot;? They're rebalancing our class due to destroying how RPPM trinkets effected our damage output. Juju and Renataki are not going to be the masterpieces they were in 5.3 post-RPPM buff for us like they are now. With them changing how RPPM works, it directly hurt all the melee, but it hurt rogues a lot more than you're assuming.<br />
<br />
We got the same &quot;Siege of Orgrimmar melee buff&quot; that everyone else got, and we got a little something extra to compensate for how shitty our RPPM trinkets are going to be for the first few weeks until we get the new trinkets.<br />
<br />
I understand you're pissed off that Windwalker Monks got completely shit on. Our monk isn't happy about it, either. Every monk I talk to is pissed, and justifiably so. They certainly over-did it on you guys, when in reality you guys were on par with all of the other melee. There will be buffs headed your way, no doubt. They won't let the new class of the new expansion be in the shitter for the last tier of their introductory expansion.<br />
<br />
And seriously, 4 button rotation? Are windwalker monks really in any position to criticize someone else's combat rotation? Tiger Palm, Jab, RSK, BoK. Compelling stuff. And no, Rune of Reorigination does not make Windwalkers exciting. That's why they're breaking it.<br />
<br />
I agree with you in almost everything except the retri buff. Yes we got our guardian cd down to 3 mins instead of 5 mins but they also nerfed the strength buff it gives down to 12% from 20% so yeah...it might be buff indeed but not big one. About inquisition in fact it was more of a quality of life not a buff they just increased it's duration.</div></div><hr />

A: Good. It was originally their ability. If anyone needs the best MS, it should be warriors.<br />
<br />
Hmm can we have a monopoly on misdirect abilities then? Or at least the best one? Rogues can MD and buff the target. It looks like more &quot;Hunters can't have nice things.&quot; Also the BS about removing Readiness for PvP and PvE, maybe but its like 99% PvP reasons and 1% PvE(some people think its hard during pulls). Readiness is actually an interesting ability to use and time in PvE and since they removed frost mages readiness ability, it is actually something nice only hunters have.<br />

Lots of people have them for soloing or farming too which also doesnt count. Besides since when does class balance depend on representation? All classes should be balanced based on abilities and then representation will just boil down to what type of play style people like instead of this stupid &quot;We need to buff rogues because theres only 2 of them.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. This is from the previous build. It was split into 2 builds for some reason and this was the second part of it. So this is the 10%. And they have buffed them by 10% 5 or 6 times in the last 3 expansions. It's never enough, and it never will be.</div></div><hr />

Well, you should've seen it coming: you had utility, mobility, survivability AND dps, all at the top.<br />
Too much, ain't it?<br />
Plus, it's not the final damage pass, and simulations say nothing about how the spec will behave in the next patch. I'd rather base myself upon raid logs.</div></div><hr />

But they come on MMO-champ and see that Blizz is acknowledging that their class was tuned a little lower than optimal and they're like &quot;hey, yeah, that's why I'm doing so bad! Blizz sucks!
