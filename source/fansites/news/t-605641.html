Arena Tournament Battle<br />
GMs and members of the community team will be on Tournament Test Realm once again today ! You might want to drop by if you missed it the first time. <br />
We’re once again bringing the fight to the Tournament Test Realm (TTR) and challenging players in the 2v2, 3v3, and 5v5 arena brackets. Blizzard will be out in force taking on any challengers and making personal appearances near the various vendor locations.<br />
<br />
The Tournament Arena Battle will take place on Wednesday between 5:00 PM PDT and 8:00 PM PDT, and members of the Community and Development teams will once again be present to dispense mayhem and destruction upon all who challenge them. You’ll be able to easily spot any Blizzard employees as we’ll be the only players who are in a guild, which will be “Blizzard Entertainment” for Horde, and “Blizzard” for Alliance.<br />
<br />
As this is a stress test we do anticipate that the realms will be stressed to their maximum capacities and there is the possibility issues may occur. Have no fear, we’ll be watching and waiting to resolve any issues that may crop up as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Visit http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/ptr/ (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/ptr/) to begin downloading the PTR client if you haven’t already. No character copies will be needed for this unique event as you will get access to the character and gear of your choice just by logging in. The 2.4 PTR client will provide access to the Tournament realm so download it soon and we’ll see you in the arenas!<br />
If you didn't see them two days ago, here are the screenshots of the latest Arena Tournament Battle event held during the week end.<br />

Fixes/changes included in major content patches<br />
So ... Why does it take so long to get things fixed sometimes, just because Blizzard wants to add it in a &quot;big&quot; patch and not just fix some of these issues during a maintenance ? Tigole answers. <br />
1) From a technical standpoint, we can't make some of the changes stated above without patching the client and server. We *need* to patch them in. We can't just make those changes magically appear during maintenance. Some of those changes are beyond the scope of what is possible in a hotfix as well. We'd love to be able to change stuff like that on the fly, but we can't do it from a technical standpoint.<br />
<br />
2) Even if we could do those changes without a patch, it would be very risky. Any change, however small, can cause a ripple effect of bugs in the game. It's very important to test out any change before pushing it live.<br />
<br />
3) Assuming there were no bugs, we still want to see things on the PTR to test things from a design standpoint. Think about all of the changes that were done in 2.4 which were eventually backed out. The change to drinking, the class changes etc. We need to see how some of these ideas play out in a semi-live environment first.<br />

WotLK system requirements<br />
If your computer can run Burning Crusade, WotLK should work just fine. <br />
What I'm saying is that we are continuing to develop with as many users as possible in mind. I'm not going to call out any specifics since we haven't publicized any at this point in time. I couldn't tell you if any upgrades would be needed or not since it depends on your machine and what it can handle. The likelihood of us switching to any one particular platform after supporting what we do right now, would be very low.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that now there reducing the distance to use cyclone is yet another nerf of Balance (if not all) druids that makes the class harder to use. There doing the same thing to Druids that they did to Marksman hunters. While at the same time Warlocks are the most overpowered class in the game they decide to even add some abilities; Like dotting someone while they're feared and being attacked by a pet wasn't bad enough!!!<br />
<br />
Here's a suggestion Blizzard, wake the hell up, and stop sucking the fun out if the game. Add some abilities instead of taking them away for certain classes and don't just favor Locks (and Shamans) which happens so often.<br />

Resto druids are favoured in 2v2. Ferals and Balance druids are barely represented in ANY arena size, and are the ones that are being hit hardest with these nerfs to Cyclone and Lifebloom (Restos lose ~4% co-eff. on LB due to the buff to the HoT talents. Other specs lose the full 20%). They depend on it for survival more due to weaker self healing, and makes kiting a lot harder on the melee classes as Balance.<br />
<br />
I find it difficult to arena or even BGs as either Feral or Balance spec, so I don't bother as it's just way too frustrating. This nerf makes it even more limiting for any druid that isn't dedicated Resto to be remotely viable, even in the lower ratings or any Arena size.<br />
<br />
Cyclone is a druids &quot;trump&quot; card. It's really the only spell that makes Balance/Ferals &quot;playable&quot; in PvP.<br />
<br />
Note: I agree that the post was a bit obscene, but his general intentions are correct to a degree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing too 'class breaking'. The things that were way too strong in arena (for druids) were heals, cyclone, drinking and fleeing.<br />
<br />
All those things are getting addressed. Makes it more fair.</div></div><hr />

Since I am only missing two epic jewelcrafting recipes, this will give me a 1-up in the initial weeks of 2.4.<br />
<br />
Having any jewelcrafting scrub be able to buy those recipes for a cheap price and grinding easy rep was a bit of a slap in the face for Hyjal jewelcrafters. It takes a long time to get scale of sand rep, and some of these recipes weren't available until revered.</div></div><hr />

In one nerf blizzard has crippled OP pvp class so they are no longer &quot;playable&quot;. <br />

What Blizzard doesn't seem understand is 2v2 the most popular bracket, most people prefer it to the others because it's easier to get one other person and just do it. Balancing around 5v5 will imbalance peoples favourite bracket further.<br />

If you dominate in 2v2, why do you need to play 5v5? It's obvious.<br />
<br />
Some classes must play 5v5 to escape being dominated by their anti-classes in 2v2. <br />
<br />
AFAIK if 1-2 classes owns a particular bracket they do not need any more buffs or balancing for 5v5. They already have Arena on farm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Some classes are pretty balanced thus they work in 5v5 as they are meant to according to Blizzard. Druid only work in one bracket really. I'm all for wiping out 2v2 and 3v3 completely. But in order to do that they'd have to fine tune druids, which yes, includes some much needed buffs to certain specs. Hell, there are several specs of your choice of class that need work, but it won't get done. Aside from WSG flag running druids have never really been sought after for much, esp pre-BC. The whole community implodes on itself when druids are finally good at something, when clearly SL/SL locks have been dominating the whole of pvp forever. <br />
<br />
You wanna nerf resto druids? Fine, nerf the resto druid tree. Not the whole bloody class. (I'd like to add with an edit that a nerf on cyclone range isn't gunna change anything for the pillar humping HoTkity. Just putting that out there.)</div></div><hr />

And what do you think other healing classes have to do?<br />
<br />
If a healer has a mob on him he is either busy healing himself or dead. A tank does not die instantly. If the healer has aggro the tank has a grace period to get the mob back under control. If he cannots its uaully a wipe, but that is the case for every healing class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Have you played a healer much? I've played extensively as both holy priest, holy paladin, and restoration druid.<br />
<br />
A paladin has the following options: punch, bubble<br />
<br />
A priest has the following options: fade, shield, fear<br />
<br />
I don't know what a restoration shaman does, I haven't played that one.<br />
<br />
A good healer has to know how to defend themselves. There are plenty of situations where there is no choice (aggro wipes, uncontrollable adds). The most common is an unexpected sheep pop, hunter trap failure. Sure, sometimes you have to let the tank float, but bearform is around 4-5 heals worth of mana, and doesn't free you up to continue healing. <br />
<br />
Heck, in some groups the healer is really not that important. There are times with a warrior tank in H shattered halls where i just have to blast out the heals and accept some mob may come kill me. By the time I'm dead, the shaman/balance druid/spriest can pick up the heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When your healer is perma-cycloned by a druid, warrior by &quot;themselves&quot; is ALWAYS a reality.<br />
<br />
MMS Hunter + healer the hunter can still do plenty when the healer is CCed or dead.<br />
<br />
Stop trying to place warrior as if they are powerful. Just look at the stats post by blizzard. Warriors are not as highly represented as people think nor are they most prefered in any bracket.<br />
<br />
Just because you preceive warrior as a &quot;dumb&quot; or &quot;easy&quot; class to play due to it's lack of utility (not fault of the warrior, but fault of the class) doesn't mean that it is. You try to stay ahead of kiting as a warrior before going about saying warriors are OP. There is only so much you can do as a warrior in terms of abilities, where for classes like druids and hunter the possibilities are limitless.</div></div><hr />

You should see these druids healing their dps partner to full while having sex with the tomb in lordaeron ruins, it's comical. Have you ever seen 2 warrior/druid teams fight each other? It's like watching the special olympics. Yet these teams can still beat any other combination with lifebloom/pillar humping alone. Thats really not what blizzard had in mind for 2v2 im sure. about 75% of teams 1900+ that i've seen have pillar humping druids. Thats why blizzard is changing it.</div></div><hr />

In one nerf blizzard has crippled OP pvp class so they are no longer &quot;playable&quot;. <br />
<br />
seriously, its a range nerf. No ones going to die over it.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's not the point.<br />
<br />
The point is they're nerfing an entire class instead of the spec. They're just giving a blanket solution to a specific problem, which invariably effects other players that rely on it a lot more. <br />
<br />
This won't fix Resto dominance in 2v2, it will however push Balance/ferals out of the picture even more in ALL brackets.</div></div><hr />

Fear is unuseable in 90% of all pulls because you have a very high probability to aggro additional mobs.

what do you mean shield is unusable? shield is only what, a 3 or 5 second CD? unless you meant pain suppression as shield, but you rarely see that in pve healing situations. also if your party can't address adds in 10 seconds you should find a new group. <br />

Cuz 9 seconds is perma...trinket much? And yes, a trinket DOES kill the duration of cyclone by at least 3 seconds. I am still blown away by how fear is the best CC in the game but no one bitches about it, dispellable or not. Maybe everyone plays lock o.0</div></div><hr />

It's not like the bubble is actually called bubble by the game. I don't see people talking about &quot;Divine Shield&quot; much.<br />
<br />
Your thesis seems to be that druid healers should *not* use cyclone? It's their superior form of defense. Bear is the second (or third, depending upon options) line of defense.<br />
<br />
As for fear, my priest usually stands very far to the back of the group, and fear is safe to use a significant percentage of the time. It's the second line of defense after fade, in many situations. Shield is definitely something you use on yourself, and it's better than a heal for self-protection because - again - it allows you to continue casting. Damage that the shield eats cannot pushback on a prayer of healing, greater heal, etc.<br />
<br />
There certainly *are* times when, even with a full lifebloom stack on the tank, rejuv, and regrowth both ticking away, the tank will *still* die if you stop healing him for about 4 seconds or so. The window to refresh one of the hots is missed, the throughput falls, and the tank dies unless you have nature's swiftness in reserve.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what your point is anyway. Cyclone is one of the important tools in a healing druid's arsenal, as bubble is to a holy paladin, and fade is to a priest. As a PVE healer, it is sad that my lead-time to stop an add is getting reduced. It's not a huge reduction in utility, but as a high-threat, fairly squishy healer, it's not one I'm excited about.</div></div><hr />

Shaman *pray* that our (20minute cooldown) Rock elemental doesn't get oneshot himself. If that fails, we use our Ahkn to wipe agro (our 40minute cooldown with talents, otherwise it's on an hour timer). Usually, you make sure to pick a decent tank if you want to heal anything other than PvP. <br />
<br />
Shaman PvP on BG9 consists of watching the match after you were trained down in the opening. Hopefully, you got Hero/Blood off before you entered stunlock. :D<br />
<br />

(for the uninitiated, use of the Ahkn requires you to be dead)</div></div><hr />

what do you mean shield is unusable? shield is only what, a 3 or 5 second CD? unless you meant pain suppression as shield, but you rarely see that in pve healing situations. also if your party can't address adds in 10 seconds you should find a new group. <br />
<br />
Reading comprehension? Where do I say shield is unusable? I said FEAR is unuseable. Unless you do every single pull WAY back a fear will pretty much gurantee aggroing another group, which is in most cases worse then the healer dying.<br />
<br />
And, again, the point is if the tank cannot survive for 10 seconds till it pulled the add of the druids so it can shift out of bear..same thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
its true shamans do just stand there, but at least you are able to take hits with ~10k+ armor and some heals on yourself until the add is handled.<br />
<br />
As can a druid in bear form. It does not need cyclone.<br />
<br />
I can tank minor adds a bit, yes. But then I need to focus heals of myself (aka none for the tank). And I HAVE been oneshotted by adds myself. Those guards in sethekk halls are great for that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Psykhe</div><div class="date">2008-03-13, 09:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your thesis seems to be that druid healers should *not* use cyclone? It's their superior form of defense. Bear is the second (or third, depending upon options) line of defense.<br />
<br />
No, my thesis is that druids do not need cyclone to be viable as PvE healers.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for fear, my priest usually stands very far to the back of the group, and fear is safe to use a significant percentage of the time.<br />
<br />
The fear lasts quite a long time. Also, unless oyu clear every isngle group of an instance, which is rarely the case, you will be near mobs even if you stand far back. The priests fear is a desperation tactics.<br />
<br />
<br />
There certainly *are* times when, even with a full lifebloom stack on the tank, rejuv, and regrowth both ticking away, the tank will *still* die if you stop healing him for about 4 seconds or so.<br />
<br />
In which situation with other healers if they stop focussing on the tank because the need to deal with an add a tank death is also the most likely result.<br />
<br />
Sometimes an error results in a wipe. Thats life. And that is NOT different with other healers.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what your point is anyway. Cyclone is one of the important tools in a healing druid's arsenal, as bubble is to a holy paladin, and fade is to a priest. As a PVE healer, it is sad that my lead-time to stop an add is getting reduced. It's not a huge reduction in utility, but as a high-threat, fairly squishy healer, it's not one I'm excited about.<br />
<br />
Firstly, there is one utterly major difference. Those abilites have cooldowns. Cyclone hasn't. If you want to give cyclone a 5 minute (or even 1 minute) cooldown as the shields (or HoJ) have, sure. But for an ability which can be chained... no..it is definately not compareable.<br />
<br />
Secondly, what is YOUR point?<br />
<br />
You complain that the reduced range of cyclone is nerfing PvE druids because they have to get close to their group.<br />
<br />
WHY? Why do they have to get close? Please answer me that.<br />
<br />
The ONLY, singular, reason for that which I can see would be if they want to use cyclone to save ANOTHER group member. If they want to save themselves it does not matter if cyclone has a 40 yard, 30 yard, or 20 yard range. Because the mobs run to the druid. If you are able to cyclone them if they are 30 yards away from you, but unable to do so when they are at 20 yards already then you should work on your reaction times.<br />
<br />
For the self defence ability of druids the cyclone range nerf has zero, zip, zilch, nada, *no* negative effect. The priest fear or the pally &quot;punch&quot; - which you list as effective abilities - have only *half* the range of the nerfed cyclone.</div></div><hr />

And yes, a trinket DOES kill the duration of cyclone by at least 3 seconds. I am still blown away by how fear is the best CC in the game but no one bitches about it, dispellable or not. Maybe everyone plays lock o.0<br />
<br />
<br />
9 seconds with no cooldown? I'd say that pretty freakin' perma.<br />
<br />
Trinket kills, but if you trinket out of cyclone it is pointless. Your root cooldown will be up and you'll just root the said warrior really easy, and get out of the intercept rage again.<br />
<br />
Fear is the best CC in game? Many classes can break it in pvp, plus it is quite hard to use pve. It is the WORST CC in game.<br />
<br />
Lock is hard not because of fear, but because of their endurance and pet. Stop trying to THINK you can beat a lock with a druid. They are your counterclass. Just like warrior is rogue's, or spriest is warrior's, or hunter is mage's. The fact that you think you can/you should be possible to beat a warlock already shows how OP druid is. Warrior never think they can break a spriest unless they undergeared/in disadvantage in some way. They try to run away or let someone else deal with them.<br />
<br />
Many classes can beat locks. Just not you.</div></div><hr />

Nor do other healers need their defense mechanisms. It's possible to have a flawless execution where none of this stuff is useful or important.<br />
<br />
But I play my healer to deal with as many situations as I can. My goal is to keep the group alive as best as I can regardless of what unexpected events happen, or mistakes are made. I believe that dealing with errors is the mark of a good healer.<br />
<br />
As for full clear or not, a full clear is normal in a progression run, which is when you play to the fullest. Sure when we're all doing H mechanar for the 50th time for some quick badges, we don't. And I've certainly run mechanar more times for badges than I did to learn it (cold). But I don't really think quickie badge runs are really where the game shines, nor where it's interesting to discuss class abilities. You don't use most of your abiltiies because there's no need.<br />
<br />
Then you're making things up. I said this change will reduce the distance at which it can be cast, which reduces the TIME there is to cast it. This doesn't mean I will stand closer to the tank than before. It means that there will be less time to cast cyclone when an add is running at me. Less time means I may get hit before the spell lands. One cannot begin to cast the ability until they are in range, there are times when 20 yards may be insufficient but 30 yards are enough.<br />
<br />
Is this a huge change? Of course not. I said it's &quot;unfortunate&quot;. It was an opinion made in a forum for talking about the changes that are listed. <br />
<br />
Cyclone allows me to cc the mob for 6 seconds while taking no damage, continuing in my healing patterns, and allows the tank those six seconds to ready a taunt or what have you. Bear lets me.. get hit.. for somewhat less damage than I would otherwise get hit. And after I get hit, if I'm still alive, I might have enough rage to do something about the situation, like bash or charge away. Sure, I can use those tools and sometimes do, but you seem to erroneously believe that I should choose to take damage as a healer when I can elect to not take damage.<br />
<br />
As for fear and punch having shorter range. Sure. They're also instants. Fear affects a number of nearby enemies. Fade and bubble affect the behavior of all enemies. Cyclone is spammable. Cyclone is a 1.5 second cast and only affects one target. Fade reduces the threat on the healer (temporarily). Cyclone increases the threat on the one targetted mob greatly! I don't really know what sort of threat signature bubble has, maybe someone who knows could chime in, that would be interesting!<br />
<br />
All this variation among the tools provided to classes is interesting. There's a lot of different limitations and options that the different classes have to work with. I dont' think &quot;lol you don't need one of your powers&quot; is interesting. Blizzard provided the druid class with cyclone. It's a useful tool in a wide variety of situations. <br />
<br />
I don't understand why you're acting as this is some kind of competition between healers. Or somehow trying to prove me wrong in some internet shouting match. Sorry, I'm not wrong. Cyclone is useful to defend myself as a healer, the distance reduction will make it slightly less useful. That's unfortunate. End of Message. If your thesis is some wankery about how druids have it &quot;too good&quot;, I'm not interested. Or even if you're somehow just playing armchair game designer and claiming various classes don't need the abilities they have, that's not interesting to me either. I mentioned other healers for comparison because I think it's interesting to compare various healers and what tools they have for various situations, such as tank healing, group healing, panic healing, and *other forms of defense* against death.</div></div><hr />

a druid has to shift making them unable to cast heals, cyclone is greater than bear in a heroic when trying to stay alive from a loose mob, but why are u guys crying about cyclone in pve, if a mob is on u pop barkskin and heal urself everyone knws that, if the tank cant pick it up by then with u casting a 2sec regrowth u need to die and re think ur strat<br />
<br />
i play both a druid and lock, and i think that nerfing lifebloom and the pvp speed bonus is plenty to help balance the 2v2 and 3v3 bracket, i dnt think it will help much but it might a bit, the cyclone bit seems odd, if they increase the cast time or make it instant with a longer cool down it might be a bit fair, blizz is loosing it imo<br />

<br />
As said already, then you need to work on your reaction times. Mobs do not move 20 yards in 1.4 seconds. The 10 yards extra range compared to a HoJ or psychic scream are *plenty* to compesate for the casting time if you are not sleeping. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
No, I am not. My point is that you can *afford* to choose to tank a mob temporarily instad of CCing it.<br />
<br />
It is blindingly obvious that CC a mob is the smarter and better solution. But it being better does not mean that it is *required* and that druids are without it not viable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fear affects a number of nearby enemies. Fade and bubble affect the behavior of all enemies. Cyclone is spammable. Cyclone is a 1.5 second cast and only affects one target. Fade reduces the threat on the healer (temporarily). Cyclone increases the threat on the one targetted mob greatly!<br />
<br />
The major difference here which you fail to see is that healers work differently. Druids rely to a FAR great margin on HoTs than other healers. If a priest or pally healer has to focus on himself the tank gets no heals at all usually. A tank with a druid healer still gets heals from the HoTs even if the druid healer cannot focus on him atm.<br />
<br />
This is why priests and pallies (but not shamans) have superior ways of avoiding getting distracted by adds - because they need to continuously focus on their healing target a lot more than druids.<br />
<br />
Yes, sometimes the HoTs are not enough.<br />
But sometimes the HoTs are the only thing which kept the tank alive while the druid was silenced or CCed and where the tank would have died with a pally or priest healer.<br />
<br />
Different strengths. Different Weaknesses.<br />
<br />
<br />
All this variation among the tools provided to classes is interesting.<br />
<br />
It is. Your problem is that you completely ignore your classes strengths but only focus on the weaknesses.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont' think &quot;lol you don't need one of your powers&quot; is interesting. Blizzard provided the druid class with cyclone.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are no godlike beings inable of errors. Just because they do something it does not mean it is required. <br />
<br />
If you think that them giving you an ability is proof enough that you need it then them reducing the power of that ability is also proof enough that druids do not need such a long range CC.<br />
<br />
Or are they only right in decisions which boost you?<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't understand why you're acting as this is some kind of competition between healers.<br />
<br />
You act like that. You keep trying to justify why you &quot;need&quot; a 30 yard cyclone as druid because of your imagined weakness compared to the other healers. Which simply isn't the case. I am simply pointing out your fallacies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, I'm not wrong.<br />
<br />
Saying so does not make it so. Statements without arguments behind them are worthless, hot air.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Do you need it to be viable as druid healer? No. End of message.<br />

<br />
I mentioned other healers for comparison because I think it's interesting to compare various healers and what tools they have for various situations, such as tank healing, group healing, panic healing, and *other forms of defense* against death.<br />
<br />
Exept you compare only one single part of them. Their defence against mobs. I haven't see you talking about *any* other aspect.<br />
The fact that druids have the greatest tools of still healing their target even if their are incapacitated in any way is something you completely ignore.</div></div><hr />

The speed of mobs varies, lag varies, some have charge at x distance mehcanics. Druid healers do not wear high armor bonus items, and often cannot tank mobs even in bearform. 4 realz.<br />
<br />
I never said this would make druids unviable, that's an invention on your part. <br />
<br />
The difference of hots vs direct heals is simply when the healing lag occurs. Placing the healing lag later is sometimes beneficial, sometimes it is meaningless. A someone who has actually played both styles, the only serious difference is in silence mechanic fights, which are, agreed, foolishly easy on a druid.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
To review, my position is: Cyclone is useful to a restoration druid. Being able to start the cast earlier is useful in some situations. That this is being changed is too bad, but not very important.<br />
<br />
Can you disprove that? are you trying to? Why do you care?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your original comment:<br />
<br />
&quot;There's bearform, but then i have to stop healing, and the tank will die.&quot;<br />
<br />
It won't. At least not to that extend as with pallies and priests. If they stop healing the tank *really* dies because he gets zero heals. With a druid healer the tank will still get a very fair share of heals. With a shaman and earthshield, too, but shamans won't be able to heal much when they get aggro as well.<br />
<br />
After that you keep talking and talking about what the other healers have and druids having without spareing *one* *single* *word* about what druids *have*.<br />
<br />
If you know the strengths of druids you sure kept very silent about it.<br />
<br />
Getting aggro is not the only thing which can get wrong. Many mobs also have silence and CC abilities which are largely random. A pally or priest getting hit with those has a far, *far* greater effect than a druid getting hit by them. And thats for those the druid isn't immune too.<br />
<br />
The lack of defence of the druid in one area is compensated by an additional defence of the druid in another area.<br />
<br />
Arguing that druids &quot;need&quot; cyclone because certain priest and pally abilities, but ignoring the strengths druids have is nothing but an attempt of manipulation. Or you are despite your assurances clueless. What is it?<br />
<br />
<br />
The speed of mobs varies, lag varies, some have charge at x distance mehcanics. Druid healers do not wear high armor bonus items, and often cannot tank mobs even in bearform. 4 realz.<br />
<br />
Who said they could? At least longterm. But they *can* tank them for a short time, enough for the tank to pick them up. Similar like a priest can also only fade for a short time and a pally bubble for s short time.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never said this would make druids unviable, that's an invention on your part. <br />
<br />
&quot;There's bearform, but then i have to stop healing, and the tank will die.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, that sure sounds like the description of a viable healing class.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Your original post:<br />
<br />
&quot;But this change is yet another example of PVP gimping PVE. As a restoration druid in 5-player content, cyclone is how i defend myself against goofs and unexpected situations. I need the distance on cast to be able to reliably target, cast, and have the spell land before i get 1-shotted.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Gimping PvE&quot; and &quot;I need the distance&quot; do not sound &quot;not very important&quot;. You made it sound like an essential ability of druid healers.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for why I am caring: I do not like manipulative argumentations. Yours, with the classic example of &quot;lets focus on the weaknesses and ignore the strength&quot; was one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that now there reducing the distance to use cyclone is yet another nerf of Balance (if not all) druids that makes the class harder to use. There doing the same thing to Druids that they did to Marksman hunters. While at the same time Warlocks are the most overpowered class in the game they decide to even add some abilities; Like dotting someone while they're feared and being attacked by a pet wasn't bad enough!!!<br />
<br />
Here's a suggestion Blizzard, wake the hell up, and stop sucking the fun out if the game. Add some abilities instead of taking them away for certain classes and don't just favor Locks (and Shamans) which happens so often.<br />
