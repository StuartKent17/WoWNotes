Class Q &amp; A Series -- Rogue<br />
<br />
Community Team: This segment is all about the rogue; we will delve deep into this class with Greg Street and discuss the elements that make the rogue class incredibly unique.<br />
<br />
Q. Where do rogues fit into the larger scope of things currently and where do you see them going from this point forward?<br />
<br />
A: They’re a premier melee dps class -- the personification of skulking and swashbuckling flair. It’s their primary and only role -- they’re not going to turn into tanks or healers.<br />
<br />
Rogues were once the best dps class hands-down, and a lot of the other classes were just there to buff rogues. Rogues were supposed to be selfish and not bring many buffs or utility of their own. We’re not really happy with that design any longer, and have pushed rogues to be a little more normal -- great damage in the right conditions, but also some good utility and synergy as well.<br />
<br />
Rogues have nearly always been strong in PvP, just because their shtick of coming out of stealth to stun and then unload on an opponent translates so well to everything from Arena to random world ganking.<br />
<br />
Q. What is it that makes them unique compared to all other classes?<br />
<br />
A: Rogues have a complex resource system with the balance between energy and combo points, and rely on active abilities to respond to situations rather than passive effects. This leads to a very interesting tension between planning out what you’re going to do ahead of time and reacting to proc-based resource gains (energy/combo points from things like Combat Potency, Relentless Strikes, and Ruthlessness), and rationing your active timers and abilities to survive.<br />
<br />
Community Team: Let’s look at rogue abilities, the combo point system, and the feedback our rogue community has provided on some of these.<br />
<br />
Q. Do we feel the current combo point system is working out fine for rogues, not just for Subtlety, but for all three trees? Are there any plans to improve how combo points are awarded later down the road?<br />
<br />
A: Yes, but there’s always room for improvement. Combo points are meaningful in all aspects of the game, and provide a necessary limiter on some of the rogue’s more powerful abilities. Too many combo points runs the risk of completely overwhelming your normal abilities and breaking the natural flow of the class, as Subtlety rogues who raid probably know all too well. I would expect that abilities that modify how combo points are acquired are something we’ll probably be careful with in the future.<br />
<br />
Overall, we really like the way the combo point and finishing move system works. If anything, the risk is that we could push too many other classes towards this system, which makes it less unique for the rogue.<br />
<br />
Q. Vanish, as you know, is one of the class’s staple abilities that sets it apart from other classes. However, there are times when Vanish doesn’t execute quite as the rogue intends, especially when they vanish right in the middle of some kind of enemy channeling spell or when a class sends their pet after the rogue “mid-vanish.” Do we feel that, in its current rendition, Vanish is working properly in this respect? What variables should be considered when Rogues decide to utilize Vanish to avoid it being negated?<br />
<br />
A: No, Vanish isn’t working properly and breaks when you breathe on the rogue funny. There are two problems with fixing it. One is that technically it’s just not easy. We would need to change the ways spells are resolved on the server side. Now that is something we can do, but the outcome would be taking a powerful ability and making it more powerful. We need to solve the frustration part of the ability, but not also greatly buff rogue survivability or damage potential when doing it. The solution we like the most is something like Vanish puts you in stealth for 1 second minimum no matter what else happens.<br />
<br />
Q. We’ve seen some changes made to both Mutilate and Overkill; how do we feel these abilities are faring currently and do we believe they require any additional adjustments?<br />
<br />
A: Both abilities are largely where we want them -- a poisoned enemy is still meaningful to the Mutilate rogue, and the modern Overkill keeps the feeling of being awesome while in or emerging from stealth, while being relatively more balanced than the prior incarnation. The changes seem to have had their intended effect of reducing rogue burst damage.<br />
<br />
Q. There has been mention in previous developer responses on the forums about changes planned for Hunger for Blood. Players are interested to know what is in store for this ability in the foreseeable future.<br />
<br />
A: The current design for Hunger for Blood is in place to boost rogue PvE damage without substantially boosting PvP damage. It’s not a terribly exciting talent in its current implementation, but it does the job. As such, we do have long-term plans to change it, but we think the current design works for now. Long-term we want it to be a more reactive ability -- something you use depending on the situation but use often in a fight, and not just a passive damage buff that requires a lot of management. Long-term we’d also like to get it back into PvP.<br />
<br />
Q. Rogues appreciated the original rendition of Shadow Dance and felt it to be incredibly unique. Do we have plans to implement the original functionality later down the road?<br />
<br />
A: No. The repeated snare-breaks from chain-Vanish were way too good and basically made the rogue immune to snares and roots for the duration of Shadow Dance. It wasn’t intended to be Bladestorm.<br />
<br />
Community Team: Going into the Subtlety spec for a little bit, many rogues are huge fans of the Subtlety spec and have shared similar concerns regarding this specialization such as damage output compared to Assassination and Combat.<br />
<br />
Q. Players feel Subtlety captures the essence of a rogue with the majority of its abilities revolving around stealth and utility. How do we feel this specialization is performing currently and where do we see it in the future?<br />
<br />
A: The damage is behind the other specs in PvE, and due to all the neat utility tools, Subtlety would immediately become the default spec in PvE if the damage were comparable. In the future we’d like to make it competitive, but it’s an interesting balancing act between too good and not good enough. It has a place in PvP, and should be more compelling in the post-3.2 world where survival talents will be more valuable.<br />
<br />
Long-term, we’d love to see more of the utility talents from Subtlety core for the rogue class in general, or alternatively, we’d like to see more of the damage boosts from the other trees made passive so that rogues of all trees were choosing utility versus utility when making talent choices instead of utility versus damage.<br />
<br />
Community Team: We would like to touch on various PvE aspects of the Rogue. Let’s get started.<br />
<br />
Q. For both groups and raids, utility such as raid buffs and debuffs offer great benefits for improving your party-member’s effectiveness in most PvE encounters. While rogues do have abilities such as Expose Armor, Blind, and Sap, do we have plans for added utility later on?<br />
<br />
A: Yes, the question is where we add them and how we do it without unbalancing the tightrope between the specs we walk in both PvE and PvP, and giving them too much access to their PvE damage potential in PvP. We think Tricks of the Trade is a fun utility ability that lets the rogue feel smart when it’s used most optimally. We want to make sure rogues have enough group raid buffs (currently they have Expose Armor, Mind-numbing Poison, Master Poisoner, Wound Poison, and Savage Combat), but rogue damage is sufficient now that they are pretty attractive members of the team.<br />
<br />
Q. The majority of a rogue’s damage seems to stem mostly from white damage; we’ve seen devs in the past mention revamping this to avoid it being the main source of damage. Also, with changes made recently to abilities such as Mutilate and Slice and Dice, players would like to know how exactly we plan to change this aspect for rogues.<br />
<br />
A: Rogue ability usage is still a very meaningful part of their damage, and rogues who use their abilities and timers skillfully perform much better than those who do not. As such, there aren’t really plans to change this significantly, as it’s an interesting distinction between the rogue and more ability-driven classes such as the death knight. Putting more damage into their abilities also increases the damage on an already bursty class.<br />
<br />
Q. Cool-downs are another topic that has been discussed consistently within the rogue community. Rogues understand that they are strong and efficient when they have cool-downs readily available, however on the same token, they feel a bit constrained by the limitation to their class because of various cool-downs. In a dungeon/raid encounter, they feel that they are unable to provide significant damage contributions even when attempting to manage their cool-downs to the best of their ability. How do we currently feel about cool-downs for their damage-dealing abilities?<br />
<br />
A: In dungeons they’re absolutely right -- one of the disadvantages of scaling so well in a raid scenario is that you need to start at a lower baseline. They’re better than they used to be for dungeons due to a mostly reliable Sap, but they’re still not great compared to a caster or melee hybrid. In a raid they’re great, and the problem exists between the chair and the keyboard if they’re not contributing damage effectively in that scenario. <br />
<br />
Community Team: Jumping into some PvP action with the next set of questions from our rogue community, let’s get to it!<br />
<br />
Q. Cloak of Shadows is an incredible ability; it helps rogues avoid most incoming spell damage and effects. However, how do we feel this ability stacks up versus classes that possess both melee and spell damaging abilities? Do we still feel the 90% avoidance is sufficient to aid Rogues in PvP encounters against spell casters and hybrids?<br />
<br />
A: It’s meant as a tool that’s part of a toolkit, not an I-win button. It’s sufficient, and extending it to 100% would make rogues largely immune to interesting PvE effects they shouldn’t be (e.g. Mimiron’s Shock Blast).<br />
<br />
Q. Rogues feel they take an extensive amount of damage against various classes and have very limited abilities with long cool-downs to help combat this, so they rely heavily on their avoidance abilities in PvP situations and have little to fall back on to survive. How do we feel rogue survivability is currently and are there any plans to supplement this?<br />
<br />
A: Rogues are probably too survivable when they can apply all of their crowd control to a single target and much too squishy when they can’t. Moving some of the survivability from active abilities to passive ones without losing the interesting flavor of the class is an ongoing challenge, and we’d like to do it in ways like the Feint change rather than simply adding in &quot;takes 20% less damage&quot; to a random talent.<br />
<br />
The current rogue design could be described as fragile, but rarely takes damage, since it’s possible to apply so much crowd control. Chaining crowd control and countering crowd control is a huge part of PvP that’s fun for a lot of players and we don’t want to remove that. On the other hand, we often run into problems with the rogue where we can’t diminish or change the DR on crowd control because then the rogue just takes damage and dies. An alternative model is a slightly more tanky rogue than can survive more damage (perhaps only when cooldowns are up or something), but can’t keep someone locked down so long. Also note that this would improve the rogue level-up experience as well. It’s effective and occasionally fun but can get pretty slow and tedious to have to approach every opponent from within stealth. Sometimes you just want to stab a relatively non-challenging mob to death and move on.<br />
<br />
Q. So, over the past years, rogues have utilized macros for swapping in/out weapons with different poisons to aid them in different situations, but sometimes it can become slightly cumbersome to swap between weapons to gain added utility where needed. Do we feel this is a suitable approach in aiding rogues in this respect? Are there any plans to change this later down the road to make it easier for rogues to swap poisons mid-fight?<br />
<br />
A: We agree it’s clunky to swap weapons and that’s because we don’t want it to be a major feature of the game. We could see making it a major feature, something much more like the weapon swapping of Diablo II. Currently you swap weapons more for macro-ing a shield for Spell Reflect. A rogue swapping poisons feels a little more interesting than that, but it’s pretty much the only example we could think of. Until we can make weapon swapping feel less clunky for more classes we aren’t going to push it as an important feature.<br />
<br />
Community Team: Rogues have a passion for making the best out of most every single one-handed weapon currently available in game and have definitely provided some feedback pertaining to some of these weapons available to them and utilizing them to the best of their ability with the spec they have. Let’s get into a couple of these.<br />
<br />
Q. Lots of rogues are fans of the “Combat-Daggers” setup. Do we feel this is a viable option in PvE versus other traditional setups?<br />
<br />
A: Not really. It was always a very simplistic spec that only used one finisher and limped along with no combo point income. The “rotation” for this spec, if you can call it that, was Backstab x 5, Slice and Dice, repeat. In sexy Naxx gear with a cool energy-boost set bonus it became Backstab x 5, Slice and Dice, Backstab x 3, Rupture, repeat. It was clunky to play, had massive ramp time (say 30 seconds) and positioning issues, and you couldn’t ever use your combo points or energy on anything but damage or it all fell apart. It might have been effective, but we didn’t think it was very fun and we don’t really want to promote it.<br />
<br />
To be clear, it’s always a tough call when players find a creative way to use combinations of gear and talent specs like this. Sometimes we want to reward the players for being creative. Other times they are just taking the design in a direction we’re not crazy about. There are no hard and fast rules to when “unintended” equals “bad” or not.<br />
<br />
Q. With the advent of one-handed axes coming into play as another plausible choice of weapons for rogues, why did we decide to add this feature this far into the game? What are the benefits of having one-handed axes versus the traditional weaponry available to rogues?<br />
<br />
A: We were in a world where we continued having to drop one-handed maces all the time, because swords couldn’t be used by shamans, axes by rogues, or fists by death knights. We wanted to have more variety in the type of one-handers we dropped. We discussed it quite a bit, and included the world designers and keepers of the lore in those discussions. Ultimately, we settled on axes for rogues. Rogues are supposed to be the masters of melee weaponry and there’s extensive support in classical literature for brigand/swashbuckler/lightly armored warrior types using axes (pen and paper RPGs, pirates, Native Americans with tomahawks, gladiators). If a rogue would pick up a broken bottle to use as a weapon (the infamous Barman Shanker) it seems likely they’d use a good axe. As a result, shamans and death knights should see more axes in the game overall. (Though remember, the 3.2 patch largely focused on the new Isle of Conquest BG, so we don’t have a ton of new raid bosses to itemize. That will change in 3.3.)<br />
<br />
Community Team: We’re at the end of our Q &amp; A, here, but we would like to finish this with a couple of unique lore-based questions.<br />
<br />
Q. Rogues have definitely embraced the lore behind them, including the Ravenholdt quest-line. Do we plan on expanding into this anytime soon? Players feel this specific lore really defined rogues early on in the game and would like a continuation of that.<br />
<br />
A: The problem with class-specific quests is that you’re cutting off 90% (give or take depending on class popularity) of players from seeing the content. Put another way, you can offer 100 class-specific quests per class, or 1000 quests that almost everyone can see. We don’t have any announcements of new content in that quest line at this time.<br />
<br />
Q. Are there any other lore-based quests that we will be providing not just for rogues but for classes in general, later down the road? Players feel these provide their respective class with a unique touch and allows for a more immersive feel to their gameplay.<br />
<br />
A: As I said above, class quests are expensive from a content-development standpoint. That said, we recognize why they are so popular and can be so memorable. We made a lot of death knight-specific content for Wrath of the Lich King, and it may very well be the best zone of quests in the game. With content like this we don’t operate on a yes or no level, but off of a wish list. We would love to add more class-specific quests, but there’s a ton of other things we want to do with World of Warcraft as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I doubt the season will end on patch release day. The new raid is being released one boss per week (this is still true right?), which means if they released the new season on day 1, PVPers would potentially have access to higher DPS weapons than PVEers, which has been a problem in the past.<br />
<br />

They can activate Season 7 later. patch =/= New Season, just &quot;new season material&quot;.<br />

The new raid is being released one boss per week (this is still true right?), which means if they released the new season on day 1, PVPers would potentially have access to higher DPS weapons than PVEers, which has been a problem in the past.<br />
<br />
My guess is that the season will end 4-5 weeks into the patch, once all bosses are available.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm going with this. I think they'll officially announce the patch today, and end the season 1 week into the patch. That gives one last week w/o the changes, and 1 week with them (1+1 = 2 yay!), but extremely limited access to the near gear before the season ends. Then they can take however long to begin the next season, all changes/gear included.</div></div><hr />

I knew it would be useful to be french at some point. A Blizzard employee made a VERY interesting comment on the french technical support forums. I'm not sure if it means that the patch will hit the live servers this week or the one after, but it's definitely one of these two. (Note: I'd bet on this week) <br />
French Version<br />
Les mises à jour sont triées par ordre, il vous faut trouver toutes les mises à jour jusqu'en version 3.1.3... et 3.2 à partir de mercredi prochain. <br />
<br />
Translation<br />
Updates are sorted based on their release date, you have to find all the updates up to patch 3.1.3 ... and 3.2 after next wednesday. <br />
<br />
<br />
Being French Canadian, basically what this means, or what is said, is that Updates are filtered by order, you have to find all the updates until version 3.1.3 and starting this Wednesday from 3.2 and on. Since updates are done on Wednesdays on EU servers, I would assume that 3.2 will be out tomorrow on US servers.</div></div><hr />

They CAN do whatever they want.<br />
Will they is the question.<br />
And i said this before in the other pvp whine topic, they patched the TR as well 2-3 weeks before that &quot;season&quot; ended which caused alot of comps to be forced to change their strats and whatnot to claim their position on the ladder.<br />
And that's in an environment competing for possible rl cash, which ways alot higher then a title+mount in my book.<br />

<br />
1. Blizzard has always given arena players 2 weeks notice as to when the season is ending, to allow for players to have a last chance to earn their gear and ratings, and to allow others to purchase any gear they have been saving for. Arena Points reset after this season.<br />
<br />
2. Patch 3.2 brings about all kinds of changes including talents, glyphs, items, skills, certain gameplay and mechanics (totem bars), and RESILIENCE CHANGES. If 3.2 came out tomorrow, and people had two weeks to get their respective titles AFTER the 3.2 changes were implemented, then the entirety of season 6 would be moot. This is the most compelling evidence in my mind. They simply cannot release the patch and have the resilience changes and season 6 coincide. At all. <br />
<br />
3. New loot. Although the new raid instance is only being released slowly (i think?), Koralon still drops currently unattainable items, including relentless pieces. Again, having this gear available DURING season 6 is unacceptable, and if the patch came tomorrow and season 6 was interrupted without warning, the world would explode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Who said the arena season is going to end? <br />
2. Indeed it does, but if they can do that on a TR (which is more important), why not on live servers? Also, most of the people sitting on titles are mostly people that got it in the first two weeks and haven't played since. Think this will change that?<br />
3. New loot? Yes relentless. If you think back to the start of wotlk, you could go VOA and get 3/5 deadly pieces before S5 had even started. But you couldn't buy the new honor/arena pieces as the vendors just weren't up, why are they unable to do this again.<br />
<br />
Its becoming apparent that you can't say that blizzard can't release a patch JUST because of arena.</div></div><hr />

It can mean both really, hard to say without context (which we will never get).<br />
&quot;Mercredi prochain&quot; can mean both &quot;coming wednesday&quot; or &quot;next wednesday&quot;.</div></div><hr />

What is said is that &quot;To play, you'll need to download the 3.2 patch after next Wednesday&quot;. If you're forced to download the patch, it means it'll be released on servers.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Orton</div><div class="date">2009-08-03, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Evidence that 3.2 is NOT coming on Tuesday. <br />
<br />
1. Blizzard has always given arena players 2 weeks notice as to when the season is ending, to allow for players to have a last chance to earn their gear and ratings, and to allow others to purchase any gear they have been saving for. Arena Points reset after this season.<br />
<br />
2. Patch 3.2 brings about all kinds of changes including talents, glyphs, items, skills, certain gameplay and mechanics (totem bars), and RESILIENCE CHANGES. If 3.2 came out tomorrow, and people had two weeks to get their respective titles AFTER the 3.2 changes were implemented, then the entirety of season 6 would be moot. This is the most compelling evidence in my mind. They simply cannot release the patch and have the resilience changes and season 6 coincide. At all. <br />
<br />
3. New loot. Although the new raid instance is only being released slowly (i think?), Koralon still drops currently unattainable items, including relentless pieces. Again, having this gear available DURING season 6 is unacceptable, and if the patch came tomorrow and season 6 was interrupted without warning, the world would explode. <br />
<br />
<br />

2. Indeed it does, but if they can do that on a TR (which is more important), why not on live servers? Also, most of the people sitting on titles are mostly people that got it in the first two weeks and haven't played since. Think this will change that?<br />
3. New loot? Yes relentless. If you think back to the start of wotlk, you could go VOA and get 3/5 deadly pieces before S5 had even started. But you couldn't buy the new honor/arena pieces as the vendors just weren't up, why are they unable to do this again.<br />
<br />
Its becoming apparent that you can't say that blizzard can't release a patch JUST because of arena.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. I'm aware that a new patch does NOT mean a new arena season. I should have stated that explicitly but apprently it's too big a flamebait for people to resist. This doesn't change my point. <br />
<br />
2. It's not an issue of what they CAN or CANT do, but putting major changes like the Resil changes on the live server is a big, big deal. Why in god's name would Season 6 be active while these changes are implemented on live servers? The final ratings of Season 6 cannot be based on the major changes that come with 3.2. And don't give me that crap about &quot;most of the good players would already be up there.&quot; Most doesn't matter. <br />
<br />
3. True, but Deadly gear was PART of Season 4. Relentless is not part of S6, and therefore it would be backwards for this gear to be usable for any part (especially the last two weeks where ratings matter) of S6.</div></div><hr />

Stopped leveling most of my alts waiting for the patch. Got a 70 priest now dying to get her flyer for Northrend and a warrior and rogue sitting on the gold for epic flying. Waiting on the new heirlooms and dailies, too. Getting so bored doing the same dailies between all of my toons.<br />
<br />
As for arena, between season 3 and season 4, a major content patch (2.4 if I recall correctly) was released causing a lot of wannabe arena title holders to suddenly drop out of the running in the final weeks and get replaced with the Flavor of the 2.4 Patch classes. It's not unlikely that this season will see patch 3.2 released while it is still running and thus many of the Flavor of the 3.1 Patch classes will start to fade for the newer Flavor of the 3.2 Patch classes. Those that face rolled their way to what they thought would be at least a title for arena will have to fight to keep it once the patch hits. It's likely many may lose their spot for a title. Those that actually have skill will likely retain those titles once the season ends. You have the skill, you have nothing to worry about. You facerolled to your title spot, then you should be more worried.<br />
<br />
Either way, if the patch is this week or next, I doubt Arena will end before Blizzcon hits so there will be a lot of class balance changes that people will have to contend with. Should be fun reading chats to see who's whining about what class and arena combos.</div></div><hr />

Even with this logic of your's they can put out 3.2 and say the current one will end in 2 more weeks.<br />

3.2 was confirmed to be the start of season 7; seasons always receive two weeks notice before ending. Wouldn't the logical conclusion be we are at least 2 weeks from 3.2?<br />

<br />
They would never implement sweeping class changes mid-season. It would stand to reason that the end of s6 could be announced today/tomorrow with the understanding that 3.2 will be released in 2 weeks' time. That being said, my guess would be that the EARLIEST we will see 3.2 hit live servers would be August 18, and that is only if they announce it in the next ~24 hours.</div></div><hr />

Hey, remember how Blizzard introduced a completely new ratings system in the middle of season 5? Somehow I don't think resilience change is as major as complete rewamp of the ladder system. So this point holds little to no grounds.</div></div><hr />

Have you been on the PTR??? The Resilience changes have an enormous impact on every match. They are not at all comparable to the changes they made in S5, which were to fix an apparent bug that changed team rating but not player rating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A season can end before a patch, during a patch or after a patch.<br />
<br />
Usually, they like to give time for the PvE part of the game to line up with the PvP part of the game. As in, top tier weapons will match the PvE/PvP progression.<br />
<br />
Since the last boss of the new instance is locked away for at least another 4 weeks after the patch, there is no need to start a new season as soon as the patch hits because it leaves potential for players to have the top tiered weapons before Anub'Arak is even seen on any server.<br />

I have it on good source (aka, speaking both) that French and Quebecois aren't the same thing.<br />
That said, as has been said many times &quot;this &lt;insert day&gt;&quot; isn't a commonly used phrase in either language, and &quot;prochain &lt;insert day&gt;&quot; is used to refer to both the coming day and the one in the next week.<br />

Didn't know about Vault lockout, but regardless...I say again...<br />
<br />
RESILIENCE changes and CLASS changes are too grave to have involvement in the end of Season 6. If this really happens tomorrow...think of all the rets who would have gotten glad and all the resto shamans that steal it away from them in the next two weeks. Season 6 Gladiators (ie patch 3.1) with patch 3.2 rules??? Doesn't make sense!!!</div></div><hr />

Yeah, trying to balance the season doesn't make sense. Blizzard MUST keep imbalanced chars alive over one season, they can't just nerf those classes and buff new ones.<br />

Because they could also end the season at the same time. Then give everyone a 2-3 week grace period to get used to the new system and talents before the new season starts without having to worry about the PvP progression passing the PvP progression...<br />
<br />
...and if you PvP for titles, mounts and rewards. You should have been playing the last couple of weeks as if the season was about to end. So don't go crying as if you didn't know the patch was coming soon. The PvE'rs were able to deduct that the patch was 1-2 weeks away once the PTR patches stopped showing new class or boss changes.</div></div><hr />

They can release the patch without starting season 6 right away... The put the patch out on live servers, give 2 weeks to finalize your purchases with arena points and such, get used to the new resilience change and different class changes they have made and then launch the season 6 of PvP... It isn't because the patch will be made live that all the content will be introduced... best example for this is the expansion... it's called wotlk and yet, you can't even kill him nor do we know when it will be made available... same can apply to this patch...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am starting to side with the arena folks. I really think they will not roll it out Tues. I think they will announce the end of the season Tues. I just see too many changes to not give the arena folks a heads up. <br />
<br />
BUT I really hope it does come out Tues. I just leveled my 4th 80 (for PvP), and have started having fun running heroics again. I would be nice to have a reason to play my main besides just raiding. I log my Main in for raid, then log out until next raid day. It would be nice to get use out of my other Spec (Tank), besides a fill in when one of our tankls can't make the raid.</div></div><hr />

They can just push a little button and stop Arenas. Push another button and start them.<br />

I think you're talking about me. I'm not arena-centric. I just have a good sense of things. I don't think continuing Season 6 into 3.2 with the major changes to resilience is a good idea. At all. And I think the complications of implementing 3.2 before season 6 ends are evidence enough that it's not coming, but apparently that's not the case. <br />

That said, we recognize why they are so popular and can be so memorable. We made a lot of death knight-specific content for Wrath of the Lich King, and it may very well be the best zone of quests in the game. With content like this we don’t operate on a yes or no level, but off of a wish list. We would love to add more class-specific quests, but there’s a ton of other things we want to do with World of Warcraft as well. <br />
<br />

I think their current design philosophy standpoint on class quests is utter BS.<br />

There were some fun class quests in Vanilla WoW, and I think class quests are really fun and get you into your class. I don't understand why they can't take a little time and make some new class quests.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, Naxxramas sure takes three raidnights when Ulduar geared.<br />

You take a blue post and treat it as the holy-grail of truth. This is much similar to players taking something a GM says as pure gold. PROTIP: GMs and &quot;Blues&quot; have the ability to talk out of their asses and are completely capable of being wrong. There is absolutely NO WAY a new patch will come in the middle of a season, and you are just naive to think so. Like it or not, PvP is a part of this game and Blizzard will not make major changes to a season while it is still going.<br />
<br />
My guess? Blizzard gives us a one week notice of the season closing instead of the usual two, and they make this announcement very soon, making the patch release date next week.</div></div><hr />

I like how people whine about everything... So I made certain I covered the basis for the people who might whine over the PvE changes and their Proto-Drakes.<br />
<br />
Continue with the whine-fest. I am going for some cheddar.<br />
<br />
@TheDrifter2k - Please. Try and read the context behind the message. Read what the both of us said. I said they try and keep seasons inline with pve progression based on the weapons. He thought for some reason I meant VoA... which does not drop any weapons.<br />

<br />
Good analogy.... except those Drakes are not being removed.<br />

<br />
1. The PTRs do not need to be down for them to push a patch. In fact, this hasn't been true for most of the patches in the last year<br />
<br />
2. The arena season does not need to end on a patch. Especially when PvE equivalent gear won't be available for 5 weeks. Blizzards logic is that good teams will till be tops, even with the class changes.<br />
<br />
Even still, everything about this patch (no testing in the last two weeks, 3 new builds in 3 days- all very minor bug fixes, the 3.2 in review thread by zarhym) absolutely screams that this patch is ready. You have one thing that says it isn't. Baring any unforeseen complication, the patch is coming out tomorrow. <br />

In this edition of Shop Talk, we’d like to offer a peek at the new information found on our Under Development page for those who may not have seen it yet. The upcoming major content patch, Call of the Crusade, will bring a host of new features for World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
<br />
The Argent Tournament Expands: With the help of Azeroth’s heroes, the Argent Crusade will finish the Argent Coliseum just in time to call for all brave citizens to prepare for battle with the Lich King. New dailies, rewards, and more will be available at the Argent Tournament grounds to lure adventurers into the coliseum.<br />
<br />
Crusaders’ Coliseum: In order to prepare for a siege on Icecrown Citadel, players will be called by the Argent Crusade to test their mettle in the coliseum. 5-player, 10-player, and 25-player challenges await inside.<br />
<br />
New Battleground: Isle of Conquest, a new large-scale siege Battleground, will be open. The Horde and Alliance will battle head-to-head for control of strategic resources to lay siege to the keeps of their opponents.<br />
<br />
New Arena Season: Season 7 will officially start, paving the way for all-new items and challenges.<br />
<br />
Much more to come. Stay tuned!<br />

<br />
Whats happened in previous arena seasons when it comes to end of season? Seem to remember when the last patch came out I went to cash in my saved up honor points but it was still the last seasons items there, which left me feeling daft, had to wait a few weeks for them (although strangely enough, the new WG items were out).<br />
<br />
On another note, can't help but think that patch won't be out just yet, not so much because of new items, but because of the resilience changes. Before the tunnel vision yells start I'm not saying 'hold up the rest of the game for the arena people' I'm saying... well would you want to be on the receiving end of the bile Blizzard would get if the patch is out before the arena season end is announced? Even if they do get lots anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What. So apparently that logic never applied to the Death Knight starting quests and the quests in Northrend, or the Paladin/Warlock mount quests. I mean, come on - if you're not going to give just Rogues class-specific quests, revive class-specific quests for each class. Every class has an interesting background and a specific organization aligned with them - there's huge potential for high-level quests.</div></div><hr />

Try again.<br />

Also, look at Season 3 and 4. Both released different times to the patches. See, i don't need to bring up the minor rating changes (yes, the one that screwed everyone for a week due to it only increasing ratings), but i will bring up relevant evidence when needed.<br />
<br />

I too was glad that they acknowledged that Vanish had some issues with it, but in reality, Vanish is still an uber ability and probably the best &quot;escape&quot; ability in the game. My idea would be to change Vanish so that direct damage taken while under its effect would not be taken (other than DoTs). Otherwise, it's still one of the Rogue's most enviable abilities - no need to QQ about it when it's already awesome.</div></div><hr />

I am french too.<br />
Generaly &quot;mercredi prochain&quot; means &quot;next wednesday&quot; BUT, on tuesdays, as you would preferably say &quot;demain&quot;, &quot;tomorow&quot; , &quot;mercredi prochain&quot; becomes the wednesday after the next in the mind of many french. <br />
This phenomenon occurs also on mondays.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There were some fun class quests in Vanilla WoW, and I think class quests are really fun and get you into your class. I don't understand why they can't take a little time and make some new class quests. <br />
<br />
<br />
Because they don't want a small minority of people to be spending more time on this game, thus giving Blizzard more money - they want EVERYONE to do that. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The wow.com thread has a huge debate over this now, regarding what circumstances you would use &quot;next wednesday&quot; and what it means being two days from the Wednesday or if its used differently in French and this and that. I think what &quot;next wednesday&quot; can mean varies from person to person so I don't see any sense in trying to interpret that post. Kind of amusing what people will argue about in the ambiguous and dangerous game of patch prophecies. <br />
<br />
Regardless, I think this patch is ready to go and I don't think that they would hold it back two weeks for a cleaner arena season change.</div></div><hr />

The guy that said that is probably (unemployed by now) a technician on the servers or something simillar. This means that the patch data is in their archives, it does not I repeat, does NOT mean it's going to be installed on the servers.<br />

Example (i'm german, btw) -&gt; It is Monday: For some people in german means &quot;next [nächsten]&quot; wednesday the wednesday coming in 2 days for others the wednesday coming in 9 days. <br />

Pretty much all of the comments here are about arena or how to read French.<br />

I know most people here are very PvE centric, but if you stepped back for a minute you'd realize that season 7 arena is supposed to start with this patch, along with implementation of all the new gear bought for WG tokens, honor, and arena points. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has not given any notice to current arena players that the arena is going to end. They have consistently stated that players will recieve, at minimum a 2 week notice prior to each seasons ending so that people can make their final push for titles, and spend their points. At the bare minimum, the patch will release 2 weeks from tommorow, so August 18th.</div></div><hr />

Why so ?<br />
Please notice that the 3.1 patch has been released before the Arena Tournament ends in America realms... and it was giving a lot of major updates in PvP... which resulted in real changes in the arena tournament rankings. ;p</div></div><hr />

You're right, it definitely could be tomorrow. I was looking back at some of the older maintenance posts corresponding with patches and they also made no mention of a patch.<br />
<br />
One of the only things that makes me think there isn't a patch tomorrow is how it isn't extended maintenance for all realms, just a select few battlegroups. If I remember correctly, they always schedule extended maintenance for all realms when a patch is being released.<br />
<br />
With 3.1.0, it was extended for all realms with one or two battlegroups having longer extended maintenance for hardware upgrades.</div></div><hr />

Although rogues do have this on our side, that is not what the PvE concern was, infact we are perfectly balanced in PvE at the moment with the exception of a few gimmicks, we are probably the most balanced PvE class there is at the moment. So please don't spray ignorance.<br />

Because it's been stated that the season will be ending shortly. Now, let's assume they release the patch tommorow and then announce the ending of season 6 two weeks later.<br />
<br />
Do you realize the sweeping changes to many classes, as well as resilience, would completely throw the PvP ladder into chaos a mere two weeks prior to its ending? Really? Honestly? The ladder wouldn't even have time to fully readjust to the changes, it would be a clusterfuck of epic proportions. <br />
<br />
When the changes of 3.2 go live, the season MUST end with it. For balance reasons and balance reasons alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The 3.1 changes were made with ample time remaining in the season. Time for everything to readjust. Two weeks is not enough time. <br />
<br />
Bottom line is believe whatever you want to believe, it's pretty irrelevant. Mark my words though, you won't be playing 3.2 on anything but test realms until the 18th of august, at the earliest.</div></div><hr />
