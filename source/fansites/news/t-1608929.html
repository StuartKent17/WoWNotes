<br />
<br />
Iron Horde Invasion - Blasted Lands Quests<br />
Upon logging in you should be able to start the short Blasted Lands quest line. These quests reward Iron Starlette (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/111660-iron-starlette), The Iron Invasion (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/9618-the-iron-invasion), and the &lt;Name&gt; of the Iron Vanguard (http://beta.wowdb.com/titles/426-of-the-iron-vanguard) title.<br />
<br />
You can find more information about the quests on the WoWDB pages for the initial Alliance (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/36498-iron-horde-invasion) / Horde (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/36499-iron-horde-invasion) quest.<br />

<br />
<br />
Gearing Up Alts<br />
If you want to gear up alts to make leveling in Warlords a little bit easier, there are now a few more ways to do so. Keep in mind that lots of items can be upgraded at the cost of 50 x Lesser Charm of Good Fortune (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/738-lesser-charm-of-good-fortune).<br />
<br />
<br />
Upper Blackrock Spire - The new version of UBRS drops item level 550 blues (ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=550&amp;filter-ilvl-max=550&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-reqlvl-max=90&amp;filter-quality=8&amp;filter-slot=2359278), which is better than you can get from Normal Siege of Orgrimmar (without upgrades). You need item level 510 to queue.<br />
Honor - Battlegrounds and arena skirmishes can give you honor to purchase item level 550 Prideful gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=550&amp;filter-ilvl-max=550).<br />
Gold - Gear that was sold for Justice or Valor previously is now sold for gold!<br />
<br />
Item Level 522 - If you have the required rep with the Shado-Pan Assault, you can grab this item level 522 gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-req-faction-1=1435&amp;filter-req-faction-2=1&amp;filter-ilvl-min=522&amp;filter-ilvl-max=522).<br />
Item Level 496 - Tuskripper Grukna (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/69060-tuskripper-grukna) (H) and Agent Malley (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/69059-agent-malley) (A) from Patch 5.1 sell some 496 items that may be of use.<br />
Item Level 489 - Commander Oxheart (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64606-commander-oxheart) sells lots of 489 gear.<br />
<br />
Timeless Isle - You can get lots of 496 gear from chests on the isle (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1328815-In-depth-Timeless-Isle-Hidden-Chest-Guide!). If you get tokens for armor you don't need, you can send them to other alts.<br />
World Bosses - The world bosses have a 15-30% chance to drop gear. Don't forget Ordos is now accessible to everyone. <br />
Siege of Orgrimmar - Flex is now normal and scales from 10 to 30, so take advantage of the Group Finder to get some gear. If you are item level 496 or above, you can get item level 528 gear from Raid Finder.<br />
Throne of Thunder - If you are at least item level 480, you can do Throne of Thunder. Bosses have a ~30% chance to drop item level 502 gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.0.2 Known Issues<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Priest - Switching targets while casting Mind Vision can cause Mind Vision to sometimes show the Priest's PoV instead of the original target.<br />
Priest - Holy Word: Serenity does not work with mouseover macros.<br />
Paladin - The temporary crit rating buffs are not increasing Parry chance through Riposte.<br />
Mage - Frozen Orb has its projectile pathing blocked by objects, such as trees, that don't block line of sight for targeted spells.<br />
Monk - Healing Spheres summoned by Gift of the Serpent will not spawn near the NPC party members during Proving Grounds.<br />
Priest - Chakra: Serenity is not increasing the healing of Glyph of Power Word: Shield (56160).<br />
<br />
<br />
Environment<br />
<br />
Trial of the Crusader: There is a camera issue when moving the camera into the alcove where the mobs enter the arena.<br />
Orgrimmar: There are three areas in the ground in the Cleft of Shadow where you can see under the world.<br />
Vale of Eternal Blossoms - There are sections of missing water and extra planes of water in several locations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Obsidian Sanctum - Drake mounts may not drop if players kill Sartharion too fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons:<br />
<br />
The special level 90 version of Upper Blackrock Spire is not visible in the dungeon finder dropdown unless you meet the average item level requirement of 510.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
It is possible for players to receive multiple Brew of the Month Club mails or no mail at all.<br />
Some Brew Vendors may not always sell the brew of the month to players who are eligible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters, Creatures, and Mounts:<br />
<br />
Creatures will rotate to face a player if the player is moving after landing the killing blow or if they one-shot the creature.<br />
A minor animation error will occur when Female Trolls do the &quot;read&quot; emote.<br />
A minor animation error will occur when Female dwarves drown.<br />
Multiple HD character models sit incorrectly in various types of chairs.<br />
The Murkablo Battle Pet isn't playing idle animation sounds, and is missing a visual fire spell effect.<br />
Orc Male's beards can sometimes appear untextured in the character creation process.<br />
Fel versions of the Dreadsteed and Felsteed mounts display some non-fel effects.<br />
Players mounted on a multi-passenger vehicle on a transport are not shown the transport loading screen when crossing continents.<br />
A minor animation error can occur with some drake mounts (Nether Drakes, Frost Wyrms) when they land after jumping.<br />
<br />
<br />
UI:<br />
<br />
Female Blood elf cloaks animate as though they are female Draenei.<br />
Players, other than the party leader, are prompted to select a role, the first time that specific group queues for an arena match.<br />
Account-wide achievement criteria may not always visually display progress (Logging in and out sometimes resolves this).<br />
Mouse-over tooltips maybe sometimes only remain on screen for a fraction of a second.<br />
The rewards tooltip for Guild Vault Voucher (7th Slot) visually displays the wrong requirements.<br />
Holy priest chakras do not work with the stance conditional.<br />
The equipment manager and title panes of the character pane may sometimes visually be blank.<br />
Some sections of the item upgrade UI (before you select an item to upgrade) has not been updated to reflect that PvE upgrades should now only cost Lesser Charms of Good Fortune. <br />
The Professions window can appear gray if opened after viewing a grayed out page of the Spellbook or Core Abilities tabs.<br />
With the Recruit-A-Friend faction suggestion active, Create New Character will autoselect races from either faction. <br />
The indicator used to show which direction the Eclipse Bar is going for a Balance Druid appears to visually flip randomly throughout the process of the bar as a whole. <br />
The skybox flickers when CrossFireX is enabled.</div></div><hr />

15-30% is the world bosses. Flex SoO has a ~25% drop rate for items.</div></div><hr />

You need item level 510 to queue.<br />
<br />
I was trying to make a list of items to farm for my resto druid.<br />
<br />
Some of the items on that list are for lvl 92 or 95 characters? The item list was confusing me. So I compared the list to wowhead version and there are many differences such as http://beta.wowdb.com/items/-barov-lumberjack-caller is not listed on the wowhead site as dropping in UBRS pre-patch event. Wowhead says 17 items are available from the special event. While the list here is 31 items.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what information is correct. Any clarification would be appreciate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There shouldn't be a known issues post before the game's ever available imho.<br />
<br />
You sound like one of those people that would rather that there be no &quot;known&quot; issues and find out about them when they get in the game.<br />
<br />
There is no game on the planet that doesn't have some kind of issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will be able to see it in our tooltips when gear switches based on spec. For example: Spellbound Runic Band of Elemental Invincibility (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/118308-spellbound-runic-band-of-elemental-invincibility)</div></div><hr />

For macro-heavy users, it makes playing a holy priest extraordinarily annoying until those issues are fixed. Last time they fixed those exact same issues it took them months. Maybe they can just copy paste the fix back in this time ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I decided to not worry about finishing my cloak with the last few Gaze buffs since the only thing I really wanted to try with a Cloak was Ordos and since I no longer needed it I figured i needn't subject myself to LFR.<br />
<br />
Then they revert it on Patch day. G fucking G Blizzard. As an avid Blizzard supporter I am actually pretty annoyed with them about it.</div></div><hr />

You can modify the launcher fairly easily.<br />

Basically you add an image called background_wow_wod.jpg to this folder<br />
<br />
Replace the XXXX Below with the current version or the &quot;BIGGEST NUMBER&quot; <br />

It has been free for all players for a few weeks at least, a friend of mine noticed when he re-subbed he had 2 expansions (inc. mop) that he didn't have before.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eace</div><div class="date">2014-10-15, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Upper Blackrock Spire - The new version of UBRS drops item level 550 blues (ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=550&amp;filter-ilvl-max=550&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-reqlvl-max=90&amp;filter-quality=8&amp;filter-slot=2359278), which is better than you can get from Normal Siege of Orgrimmar (without upgrades). You need item level 510 to queue.<br />
Honor - Battlegrounds and arena skirmishes can give you honor to purchase item level 550 Prideful gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=550&amp;filter-ilvl-max=550).<br />
Gold - [B]Gear that was sold for Justice or [COLOR=&quot;#008000&quot;]Honor previously is now sold for gold!<br />
<br />
Item Level 522 - If you have the required rep with the Shado-Pan Assault, you can grab this item level 522 gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-req-faction-1=1435&amp;filter-req-faction-2=1&amp;filter-ilvl-min=522&amp;filter-ilvl-max=522).<br />
Item Level 496 - Tuskripper Grukna (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/69060-tuskripper-grukna) (H) and Agent Malley (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/69059-agent-malley) (A) from Patch 5.1 sell some 496 items that may be of use.<br />
Item Level 489 - Commander Oxheart (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64606-commander-oxheart) sells lots of 489 gear.<br />
<br />
Timeless Isle - You can get lots of 496 gear from chests on the isle (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1328815-In-depth-Timeless-Isle-Hidden-Chest-Guide!). If you get tokens for armor you don't need, you can send them to other alts.<br />
World Bosses - The world bosses have a 15-30% chance to drop gear. Don't forget Ordos is now accessible to everyone. <br />
Siege of Orgrimmar - Flex is now normal and scales from 10 to 30, so take advantage of the Group Finder to get some gear. If you are item level 496 or above, you can get item level 528 gear from Raid Finder.<br />
Throne of Thunder - If you are at least item level 480, you can do Throne of Thunder. Bosses have a ~30% chance to drop item level 502 gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is that supposed to say Valor? Or is 522 Honor gear really purchasable with gold? *excited*</div></div><hr />

Ohh sorry misread. Yes you are right, im sure it should have said Valor and not honor. (Damn its to early for me here... hehe.)</div></div><hr />
