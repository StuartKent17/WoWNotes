Explanations on arena exploits<br />
Kalgan made a short post about exploits in arena rankings.<br />
We're keeping an eye on the new queue mechanics for exploits, but there is some critical information missing from this example. If the two players in question had not been exploiting, what rating would they be capable of maintaining?<br />
<br />
The Elo system doesn't actually rely on same-rating matchups to work, meaning if you're only skilled enough to maintain a 1800 rating, but you play 1600 rated opponents all day and night, you'll still hang around the 1800 rating mark regardless.<br />
<br />
So, in the example above, the exploit should only work if the players in question were 1850 quality players anyways, in which case their exploit didn't actually change their chances to get 1850 (or reduce on average the number of games they'd have to play to get there), it only changed who they played against to get there.<br />
<br />
The exploit would only work if you were able to consistently play against opponents that were actually worse than their rating said they were. So, for example, if players at 1500 rating on average were actually worse than 1500, than it might work. However, if anything I think players feel that playing 1500 rated matchups is just as likely (if not more likely), to put you up against a team that is actually much better than 1500, in which case this exploit is hurting your chances more than helping. This only becomes more true the more players attempt to use this tactic (since more high-rated players would actually be queuing at lower ratings).<br />

5-Man Dungeons in Wrath of the Lich King<br />
We are currently planning to keep the 5 person dungeons in Wrath of the Lich King fairly short in length, but with a boost to their overall epicness - the preview we have of The Nexus is a great example of this. The more vast and sprawling dungeons will be found in the raid dungeons which more players will be able to experience with the changes to the setup.

Death Knight creation restrictions<br />
Q :*Bornak (I think) clarified that if a server is not yet open to transfers, then you need a level 55 on that server to create a Death Knight. Once it's open to transfers, though, it's fair game.<br />
A: This is correct. At this point in time, we don't have any further limitations on the creation. As always, I like to give a caveat that this could change if we feel it's necessary. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=6441123344&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1#19))<br />
It should hold to the same idea of character creation now in regard to PvP or PvE. So if you are on PvE you could make them of the opposite faction, the same as you can now.

US forums reorganization<br />
The US forums reorganization is now complete, for the moment none of these changes are affecting european forums. <br />
Thanks everyone for your patience as we shifted things around a bit. Just a quick run-down of changes we made:<br />
Aside from the &quot;crucial&quot; forums such as Customer Service and Tech Support, everything that isn't in a sub-category has been alphabetized. &quot;Non-critical&quot; forums such as SCII and WotLK forums are left at the bottom.<br />
The Guild Recruitment forum has been split into an Alliance and Horde variation, I would fully expect traffic to increase substantially for a bit while people rush to get their ads up, but it should slow back down after a while.<br />
There's a new &quot;Gameplay Discussion&quot; subsection which now houses the Dungeon &amp; Raid, PvP, Professions, and Quest forums. Possibilities exist for other forums to be added to this subsection in the future, but for now we think its pretty solid.<br />
The drop down menu (the thing in the upper left of every forum) reflects all of these changes, and should hopefully provide a clearer and more logical separation.<br />
In addition, the &quot;WoW&quot; prefix has been removed from all forums as everyone should already be aware they're looking through forums related to World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
We now hope we never have to change them ever again. Thanks again, and happy foruming! <br />

The New and Improved Gadgetzan Times<br />
While the opening of the Dark Portal and the scandalous return of Kael’thas to the Sunwell Plateau might have been good for adventurers all over Azeroth, they haven’t been good for the goblins at the Gadgetzan Times. Known for their interest in all things explosive, there has been a significant shortage of reliable, sensible goblins to report on the events and news for this illustrious newspaper. When crisis looms, goblins get creative, and when the first ‘all-purpose automated author’ self-destructed, there was only one solution - call in the experts.<br />

You really seem to have no clue. First of all, the Elo system has absolutely nothing to do with Blizzard or MMOs. The Elo ranking system has been used for decades to rank participants in various competitions, mostly in chess.<br />
<br />
Can you please explain why a good player should gain rank when beating crap players (1800 vs 1600)? A player ranked 1900 who loses to an 1800 player wasn't really worthy of his 1900 ranking and should drop a bit. The 1800 should gain. But if either the 1800 or 1900 player beats 1600 players, why should they gain in ranking at all?<br />

<br />
<br />
From your own link: The Elo rating system is a method for calculating the relative skill levels of players in two-player games such as chess and Go.<br />
<br />
Go you.... your winning logic just about applies to Duels and nothing more.<br />
<br />
The current system is flawed in that players of a higher rating are playing at below their rating, thus ruining it for anyone who is not the god of PvP (such as myself) because they have to face 2k rated players in their 1600 team as things stand!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Comm</div><div class="date">2008-05-23, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem didn t come from Elo or Blizzard, its come from the use of Elo system to gain items.<br />
<br />
Elo work well on chess, and its also work well on the arena tournament (everybody got the same stuff)<br />
<br />
But when you apply it on the game server its become totaly broken !<br />
I will compare it to chess :<br />
<br />
Imagine that a player with 2 tower, 2 knight, 2 bishop win X times versus players with 1 tower, 2 bishop, 0 knight and therefor gain a Queen for the next game. Preventing at the same time the other player to gain his first knight ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only because they have not played enough matches to get their correct ranking. Read again. As long as players play enough matches for the system to sort everyone out, it works just fine.<br />
<br />
A 1600 player that should have 2000 rating will likely win most of his matches and therefore gain ranking, until the point where his opponents are his equal and he will only win 50% of matches. Now he's at the right spot. The same logic applies to team, be it 2, 3 or 5 players. They will find their correct team spot. Any player in that team that sticks with the team will also get a peronal rating that matches the team rating.<br />
<br />
The ONLY time you are out of phase is when a player resets the system, by resetting his own ranking when joining a new team, or when the team changes and the actual skill of the team changes. The team ranking will then be adjust up/down accordingly with matches played. The single player changing team will also return to his rating within the new team he plays.<br />
<br />
Where's the flaw? If your Godlike 2000+ player plays like a 1600 player, he wins/loses like a 1600 player to stay at that rating. If he beats everyone at 1600 his rating will per definition rise then and he will be out of your 1600 area soon enough.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thelegend</div><div class="date">2008-05-23, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm more talking at points past the start of the season where these disparities are always going to be present. <br />
<br />
The design of the system lets people compete at a lower level as discussed in a few other threads about it by lowering the team's rating through members. I personally feel it is flawed and that I should ever have to face someone considerably more skilled than me at PvP inside my own lower level bracket. It hinders my own progress because it is a mismatch in skill terms and I can learn very little when being steamrolled by players in full Season X gear compared to my minimal Resilience gear.<br />
<br />
Now admitedly that same person will move quickly up and we would hopefully not be matched again, but this assumes that they don't leave and join a new team, which traditionally the people who play in this manner do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Talk about not having a clue.<br />
As has been mentioned, the Elo system works for one on one competition.<br />
The whole reason that Kalgan's logic is so incredibly flawed is because all anyone needs to do with the current system to fight &quot;lower-skilled&quot; teams is have a few people who constantly join and quit the team in order to bring down the team rating (ensuring that the 1800 &quot;skilled&quot; team only fights 1500 teams).<br />
While the PERSONAL rating gain (for the players not quitting and rejoining) will be less than if they win vs. &quot;equally skilled&quot; teams, they will still gain personal rating.<br />
Someone going for personal rating is going to be much less worried about not getting as many points per week from the team rating as they will be about getting the rating required to buy their shoulders or their weapons.<br />
It's not that hard to figure out, but thanks for trying to flame me, and also, thanks for your link of failure.</div></div><hr />

(Not directly with Elo System, but more of a consequence of game design, which relies on classes and different builds )<br />
<br />
1 - Party composition (and spec themselves) give a direct advantage to certain class/builds combo, which directly defeats the purpose of Elo system. In chess both players have 16 &quot;equal&quot; pieces.<br />
In comparison with WoW. Feral druid is like a chess player without queen, 1 rook, 1 bishop, 1 knight and 4 pawns. Now try to &quot;fight&quot; normal player with only 1 rook, 1 bishop, 1 knight and only 4 pawns (and king of course)! <br />
<br />
2 - Gear difference plays enormous role. Especially Arena sets are (S3!) to good when fighting at 1500/1600 where some player do not have even complete S1 set.<br />
<br />
There should be imposed personal minimum arena rating limits to use S2 / S3 gear. Beacuse of common fair play and give arena rating some more meaning. No one wants full S3 players at 1500 rating!<br />
<br />
<br />
1400 - 1st S2 item // S2-S3 weapon not allowed<br />
1550 - 2nd S2 item // S2-S3 weapon not allowed<br />
1700 - 3th S2 item + 1th S3 item // S2-S3 weapon not allowed<br />
1850 - 4th S2 item + 2nd S3 items // S3 weapon not allowed<br />
2000 - 5th S2 item + 3th S3 item // S3 weapon not allowed (full S2 set allowed)<br />
2150 - 4th S3 item // <br />
2300 - full S3 set allowed <br />
<br />
Below 1400 rating gear player can have up to S1 set or PvE equipement equal to iLevel of S1 + 15 (This bonus of increased iLevel on PvE gear is because of lack of resilience.) For higher level PvE gear the exact same formula applies!</div></div><hr />

Well thats exactly what the problem is, they shouldn't gain rating, BUT in the arena system they do.<br />
<br />
Now they can exploit this by giving themselves a MUCH HIGHER chance to face someone thats worse rated then them.<br />

While the PERSONAL rating gain (for the players not quitting and rejoining) will be less than if they win vs. &quot;equally skilled&quot; teams, they will still gain personal rating.<br />
<br />
It's not that hard to figure out, but thanks for trying to flame me, and also, thanks for your link of failure.<br />

You simply cannot gain personal rating by being in a lower ranked team playing against lower ranked players. Clue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now they can exploit this by giving themselves a MUCH HIGHER chance to face someone thats worse rated then them.<br />

I don't think they do. Again, from Blizzard:<br />
