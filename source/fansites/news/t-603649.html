2.3.2 - Earth shield changes reverted.<br />
Just temporarily until they find out how to address the dispel issue.<br />
In the current version of patch 2.3.2 we added a 30 second cooldown to earth shield and lowered the mana cost by approximately 50%. We have decided to temporarily revert both of these changes until we address the dispel issue, which will likely be for patch 2.4.<br />
<br />
In short, earth shield will not be changed in patch 2.3.2.<br />

<br />
<br />
What changes would you like to see in WoW PvP, are warlocks/druids overpowered?<br />
Druids aren't really in my opinion, but warlocks on the other hand are a huge problem. Not only do they have unlimited mana, as a mana user in a very mana balanced game, but they also have a pet to prevent their opponents from ever drinking to restore mana. Add this to how self sufficient they are with drain life/siphon life, the extreme amount of damage they can output, and the massive amount of control (especially on caster damage) and they are just pretty insane. I'm not a developer and I don't have the perfect solution, but I can easily tell you something is wrong :)<br />
<br />
Funny, after hearing this my next question would have been &quot;well if warlocks are so overpowered, why the hell are you playing with a Rogue, Priest, Mage setup&quot;. Apparently warlocks are so overpowered they aren't worth using. I don't even play warlock anymore but it is obvious that the class still has some serious issues. To take the mage, rogue, priest setup for example, everyone in it will have 70 shadow resistance, the rogue and the mage can both totally remove all of a warlocks spells using either ice block or clos, the priest can dispel any that land on him. Of course the warlock could spec 41 points affliction to prevent that, but then of course he will get insta-gibbed because warlock survivability is non-existent without soul link. How someone can be on a team where every single team member can remove all of a warlocks abilities and simultaneously claim that warlocks are overpowered is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

Just looking at the mage, rogue, priest team you have:<br />
<br />
Polymorph, Counterspell, Frost nova for the Mage.<br />
Stuns, Blinds, Sap, Gouge for the Rogue.<br />
Psychic Scream, Mind Control for the Priest.<br />
<br />
Fear spam is no better than any other CC spam. You can do some damage while its up (if you are lucky) but anyone who has ever been pyroblasted while sheeped knows that that isn't exactly unique. Not to mention the basic point above, if warlocks are so overpowered how come neither team used one in the final? I guess $45,000 isn't enough of an incentive to make them use the most powerful class ...</div></div><hr />

problem is in that combo a lock has to be sl/sl. as ua you take way too much damage, especially against multiple physical damage dealers.<br />
<br />
a very very viable combo is rogue/lock/druid, which has a step up on rmp, and is equally dangerous to others. also the idea is that warlocks in general are op, don't base your justification on 3 people who are amazing at this game and have a very powerful combo and outplayed the other combos which did feature a lock :P<br />
<br />
that tournament is for the very elite players, doesnt mean the other 98% of locks arent op just because one lock didnt win some money</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mentioned the UA or SL/SL problem in my post above. It is the ultimate flaw of the warlock class, a totally dispellable magic system and some survivability, or a decent magic system and be the easiest class in the game to zerg down. Since the warlock can't respec inside the arena he is left with a 50/50 chance to be either useful or useless for any given matchup. He can spec UA and kick ass against all caster teams, or spec SL/SL and kick ass against melee teams. That is not OP, that is a coin toss. Yeah, if you come up against a warlock who happens to be the correct anti-spec for your team he may seem OP but pretty much everyone has a couple of teams they can do very well against.<br />
<br />
Either way the logic doesn't add up, if you truly believed that warlocks were OP, and you play this game for a living, would you be on a team without a warlock? I think not.</div></div><hr />
