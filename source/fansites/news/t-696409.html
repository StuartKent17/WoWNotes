We have several changes planned for Battlegrounds in the next minor content patch and would like to share them with you now. This patch will be available for public testing and we encourage you to participate, queue up and provide some feedback on these changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;ul&gt; Firstly, say goodbye to Battleground Marks of Honor. We feel this currency system is a bit outdated and are getting rid of it. Any items which require these marks as currency will have their costs adjusted appropriately to remove this requirement. The quest NPCs will still be available to award players Honor for turning in leftover marks, but this is only to help players clear this expired currency.<br />
&#13;&#13; Next, the Battleground holiday weekend will now be denoted as &quot;Call to Arms&quot; in the Battleground tab and Calendar. If you prefer a specific Battleground over all others, look for those words next to its name to determine whether or not you'll receive bonus Honor. The bonus awards for Call to Arms Battlegrounds have been adjusted.<br />
&#13;&#13;&lt;ul&gt; Winning a Call to Arms Battleground for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13; Additional Call to Arms Battleground victories after the first win for a player that day will award them with 15 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13; Losing a Call to Arms Battleground will award players with 5 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.<br />
&#13;[/list]&#13; To bring the rate at which players obtain PvP rewards with Honor more in-line with the rate at which players obtain PvE rewards via the Dungeon Finder, we'll also be increasing the amount of Honor awarded for an Honorable Kill by 100%. In light of this, the amount of experience provided from an Honorable Kill, and the amount of Honor awarded for completing the Wintergrasp weekly quests, have been reduced by 50%.<br />
<br />
It's important to note one thing about these 50% decreases. All Honor awarded for completing objectives in Battlegrounds and Wintergrasp is actually based on an Honorable Kill conversion rate. So if you destroy a tower in Alterac Valley for example, the Honor you're awarded is actually based on a flat number of Honorable Kills. Since Honorable Kills will now award 100% more Honor, completing such objectives will also award more Honor. This is why experience gains based on completing Battleground objectives and Honor awarded from the Wintergrasp quests are being decreased by 50%.<br />
&#13;&#13; Now that we hopefully have your attention, we're pleased to announce the implementation of the Random Battleground system! This system will work virtually the same as the Random Dungeon option in the Dungeon Finder. Players can queue with a group of up to five players for a Random Battleground in the Battleground tab. As with the Random Dungeon option, the Battleground chosen will not be revealed until players zone into the Battleground for which they are selected. The bonus rewards for this system are identical to the updated Call to Arms bonuses.&#13;&#13;&lt;ul&gt; Winning a Battleground using the Random Battleground option for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13; Winning additional Battlegrounds using the Random Battleground option after the first random win will award players with 15 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13; Losing a Battleground using the Random Battleground option will award players with 5 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13; When using the Random Battleground option, players will not receive additional rewards if the Battleground chosen is under the effects of the Call to Arms bonuses. In other words, the bonuses do not stack. In addition, if a player has been rewarded 30 Honorable Kills worth of bonus Honor currency from either the Random Battleground system, or the Call to Arms Battleground, he or she will be rewarded 15 Honorable Kills worth of bonus Honor currency that day for each additional victory. This applies whether the Random Battleground system is used, or the Call to Arms Battleground is chosen specifically, as a player cannot be rewarded the full amount of bonus Honor more than once per day.&#13;[/list][/list]<br />
<br />
All of these features and changes will be available in the next minor patch which should be hitting the public test realms in the near future. Please help us out by testing this system and providing your feedback so we can make some fine-tuning adjustments before the patch's release.</div></div><hr />

because you still get the 15 bonus for randoming, you only get that for specific Q if you choose the bg that is the &quot;call to arms&quot; bg or currently called &quot;holiday&quot;<br />

it won't be less, it will be the same, unless you cant do &quot;plus 100% and minus 50% = same same&quot; <br />

nope, see the part where you only get one or the other, not both in the same day. after you get the 30, each one after that gives 15.</div></div><hr />

From the Blue post you were replying to:<br />
<br />
o Winning a Battleground using the Random Battleground option for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.<br />
o Winning additional Battlegrounds using the Random Battleground option after the first random win will award players with 15 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.<br />
o Losing a Battleground using the Random Battleground option will award players with 5 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.<br />
o When using the Random Battleground option, players will not receive additional rewards if the Battleground chosen is under the effects of the Call to Arms bonuses. In other words, the bonuses do not stack. In addition, if a player has been rewarded 30 Honorable Kills worth of bonus Honor currency from either the Random Battleground system, or the Call to Arms Battleground, he or she will be rewarded 15 Honorable Kills worth of bonus Honor currency that day for each additional victory. This applies whether the Random Battleground system is used, or the Call to Arms Battleground is chosen specifically, as a player cannot be rewarded the full amount of bonus Honor more than once per day.</div></div><hr />

All in all I like this - finally something to queue for while farming as I HATE random heroics now. One a day is pretty much all I can stand aside from the 3 new ICC H's for battered hilt but not so much HOR because people still fail badly at it.</div></div><hr />

Nope. Read more. You cant get both bonuses from &quot;Call to arms&quot; and &quot;Random BG&quot; in one day. If you won random bg and then signed for CtA bg, and win it, you'll get 15HKs, not 30.</div></div><hr />

Wont this mean that ppl will be even more &quot;stuck&quot; in midfield, farming honor and screw1ng the objectives (i.e. radical stuff like capping flags and defending a spot and such)... I mean, it's bad NOW, imagine with 100% more honor for mindless midfield-farming? :(<br />

Of course, we might still get AFKers in the BGs that offer good honor, but I can deal with that.<br />
<br />
<br />
@ Dumsnut<br />
<br />
The reason to do the random BG is for extra honor. The badges are needed for the random dungeon because that's how you get gear, but you only really need honor. I do think they should combine the BG daily with it, so the first random win will give you the 25 Arena points (akin to getting frost emblems) and additional ones will just give honor, but I think it's a lot better than the current version where people pretty much only do BGs for marks.<br />
<br />
@ Doctadrew<br />
<br />
I think Strand is fine, in theory, the problem is, it's not implemented the way it should be because, if the attackers don't make it, their option is a tie or a loss, and so often people leave or AFK and so the defenders basically win in a situation that very well could have been a tie. Really, what the hell is a tie in a battleground? What if one team is right on the brink of breaking into the relic when they run out of time and the other team can't get off the beach in the same amount of time? There is supposed to be a winner. At least have some way of breaking the tie. Or simply redesign so you don't do both, you only attack or defend, and if the attackers breech, they win, if they don't, defenders win. Obviously, add some things to make it interesting like ways to add/remove time from the clock, buff yourselfs/debuff your opponents, etc.</div></div><hr />

Considering the honor gear no longer needs them, they really are useless except for handing in - in order to get additional honor or the pvp mounts (though i got them all a long time ago...).<br />
<br />
I can't be the only one thinking that that there isn't really any changes here or additions (random bg) that really enhances the overall experience of battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesnt mention about the arena points gained through BG's will they remain or not =/<br />

You get the 25 arena points from doing the BG daily quest and that hasn't been changed at all. <br />

<br />
Even if I ahve arena gear, the horde significantly is more pvp geared than alliance, just look at how many horde arena teams.<br />
<br />
I loled a bit inside, do you really think every battle group is as bad as yours?</div></div><hr />

There might be only ONE group where alliance dominates. It certainly is not bloodlust, ro any of the &quot;pro&quot; battle-groups.<br />

In bloodlust Ive gave up on EoE,Strands,and most AVs due to so many horde baddies that dont understand killing healers &gt; DPS or that Flags &lt; Towers. <br />

On the servers I am on, there are either Alliance heavy or Horde heavy as far as PvP goes. There are times where we can go days, and even weeks before we get lucky enough to win a Wintergrasp. And even then, it's only for that 2 hour span before the opposite faction reclaims it. I truly hope fixes this soon.</div></div><hr />

Just to show you:<br />
My litle broth hit 80 2 days ago with his mage and wanted to combo PvP and PvE:<br />
<br />
The PvE part<br />
First he farmt ToTC 5 normal and 1 HC after.<br />
After that he farmt the 3 ICC instance and became full decent epic in 1 day.<br />
He did some easy raids and..well can now do ICC 10, the final raid<br />
Join some VoA to get some..PvP gear in a nice PvE way<br />
<br />
PvP often means: Famr the same boring BGs till you get nust and buy one epic pvp reward, if you are lucky 2.<br />
Still farm instance because you cant get a proper weapon from you hard earnt honor &gt;:(<br />
After that join for your weakly quest in WG and just get to know how much lag one area can have<br />
If you do this every day, you will have some nice PVP gear.<br />
After that you have t find some one who is just as nuts as you and you can form an arena team.<br />
Do this again with 2 and 4.<br />
If you all have some skill you can earn points, if you do this every weak yoy can have some decent gear after....1/2 months???<br />
This option only remains for those who HATE pve and LOVE PVP....like my brother ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of people have already quoted this but no one has pointed out yet that you only get 30 HKs for the first random or Call to Arms win. Every win after that, again in the random or Call to Arms BG, only gives you 15 HKs worth of honor. 15 : 5 = 3 : 1 So basically a mark is worth 5 HKs.<br />
<br />
Also, if I understand it correctly you no longer get any bonus for winning a non-random or CtA BG. So in theory it favors the winning team less than the current system.</div></div><hr />

I think it's 64 honor per HK at level 80 (it's around there anyway), but it's variable by level so that's why Blizz doesn't just give a set number.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't really say...not a lot.Wowwiki says it &quot;depends on your level and their level&quot; which would be the same @ 80.<br />
<br />
I think I've looked in the log before and it was something like 25 honor for killing another player. So now it would be 50. Kind of sad that I have over 100 hks still don't know for sure :X<br />
<br />
Edit: It's definately not 64 hps for one hk...I regularly get ~40 hks in any BG I join, but I don't get ~2,500 honor. Even in BGs we win I hardly get 1,500.</div></div><hr />

Many people are asking this, but it's quite clearly stated that any items which require marks as a currency will have the requirements adjusted, likely in the form of Honor.

To bad that most people already made more honor than they could ever spend anyways. Sure, you can spend it all on gems and sell those, but the truth is you can't get gear unless you arena, and most people don't bother with arenas. Blizzard needs to do something about that before they bother throwing more honor at people.<br />
<br />
The one good thing about this is that you will be able to get decent gear easier as you level because low level awards will most likely just cost honor now, and you can buy honor for your alts with stone keepers shards.</div></div><hr />

You seem to misunderstand A LOT. For starters, objectives in battlegrounds will be DOUBLED as well. On top of that, there have not been diminishing returns on honorable kills for quite some time.

Its really not whine...its completely valid argument. The &quot;good changes&quot; were nothing more than throwing more free honor at people already swimming in honor that they can't spend on anything other than gems because you have to arena to benefit from any of the actual PvP rewards. If there was a system that required you to have the Lich King on farm before you could wear gear you got from ICC then most people would bitch until it was changed. Its the exact same thing with Arenas being held above Battlegrounds. Why bother doing a BG when you can't wear the gear, no matter how easy it is to get honor?</div></div><hr />

If you are actually using BGs to level up in then you are doing something wrong. SMART questing is still the best way to get experience unless you have heirlooms in which case random dungeons are possibly the best way if you are a healer/tank and get blessed with groups that do not suck.</div></div><hr />

The only real currency in WoW is TIME INVESTED. If you invest two times the amount of time to accomplish something in WoW than someone else than you spent more currency than they did. I would have to say that time invested is pretty damn equivalent to work in a good 90% of all cases, unless you are in some rare job that doesn't pay you by the hour (and even salaried positions take into account the number of hours you will be working).</div></div><hr />

the XP will not be reduced as far as i understand it.<br />
XP are based on HK Honor. the honor gets oubled,but the XP halved. so no change here.<br />
<br />
the ammount of &quot;one HK&quot; would indeed be intresesting to know.<br />
i get 62 Honor for some enemies, sometimes about 40, sometimes only about 20.</div></div><hr />

so very true, especially the part about lack of sufficient quality rewards<br />
i for one used to play bg a lot becouse of my play time (not suitable to raid) so bgs were stuffing between instances<br />

This link shows that across all US servers at level 80, Alliance win every single BG more often than horde. Sure, this isn't a complete sample, but I think the sample is large enough to conclude that just because you're Alliance, doesn't mean you automatically lose in BGs.</div></div><hr />

Area 52, an average wintergrasp is usually about 100 horde vs. 20 alliance if you're lucky and it just ends up with us 24 vehicles to 0 camping them in the graveyard where they just AOE and 1 shot any horde that comes near with 20 tenacity. Every time. I can count twice alliance has won WG in the last month. You're lucky to make rank 3 in the average WG. So if the weekly is cut in half, and we still get almost no HK's, sounds like a pretty big nerf, at least to some. <br />
<br />
Also Retaliation battlegroup is terrible and horde lose most BGs about 75% of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since when did Blizzard begin to be the US tax code.<br />
<br />
You can recieve this tax credit if you have not already recieved that tax credit. If you have recieved that tax credit this tax credit will be null and void unless you fall into the category for this other tax credit which will then allow us to take your money from the 1st tax credit and credit it back in such a way as to make the 3rd tax credit actually worthless.</div></div><hr />

to do a mark turn in you had to have at least 1 of each mark so 6 losses equals 1 turnin i think thats about 1400<br />

Well not so much, but that is still 10 games to win for each BG (and who wins 100% of the time anyways)<br />

But with this new system, you will likely be amassing honor much more quickly, and the cap still remains 75k.<br />

<br />
SHORTER QUEUES<br />
<br />
Just think of it like this, say at the moment you have 8 people in a WSG queue, 12 people in an AB queue 12 players in a SotA queue and 13 people in a EotS queue. All those people will have a 30+ minute waiting time because they have to wait for 2/3/3/2 more players respectively. Nobody gets in.<br />
<br />
Now put these 45 players in one big pool, and you have a guaranteed AB + 2x WSG (or any other combination).<br />
<br />
If you currently have 200 people in a BG and 300 people randomly queued across several BGs, then after the patch you might have 400 people in an active BG and only 100 queued.<br />
<br />
Even if your battlegrounds appear empty there is usually a lot of people in the queues, by pooling them in 1 big cluster you're guaranteed to see at least some action. With the removal of marks, which BG really doesn't matter, other than preference reasons.<br />

Same applied to heroics. Finding a group to a particular heroic could take half a day, by using the LFD system it takes between 5 seconds and 20 minutes depending on your role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
yet not T10.5/75 or this seasons Arena gear. This makes gearing an Alt up quite easy. You try getting a full run of naxx going that isn't for achievements going, and let me know how it goes. Hmm i wonder how long you would last in the crafted blue PvP gear, with a quest weapon? about 1 second instead of 6 in last seasons gear. So why don't you go complain about things that are actually an issue, like no Achievement for not dying in ToGC10, no mount in ICC10, rotface having the same slime spawn rate in 10 as 25, or the lack of melee daggers in the first wing of ICC10, but there are 2 in ICC25, and 7 caster weapons. <br />
<br />
People having the 232 T9 gear isn't a problem, you can always get the T9.75 stuff to look &quot;leet&quot; all of that gear still doesn't get you out f the fire or help you max out your dps.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;good changes&quot; were nothing more than throwing more free honor at people already swimming in honor that they can't spend on anything other than gems because you have to arena to benefit from any of the actual PvP rewards. If there was a system that required you to have the Lich King on farm before you could wear gear you got from ICC then most people would bitch until it was changed. Its the exact same thing with Arenas being held above Battlegrounds. Why bother doing a BG when you can't wear the gear, no matter how easy it is to get honor?<br />
<br />
<br />
ill consider this a valid arguement, but its whining nonetheless. Personally i dislike the arena just as much as some PVErs do because i was around for the glory days of world pvp and BGs. Now that i think about it this really does nothing for 80s lol. im lookin forward to it on my lower lvl characters tho, i wish they would remove the honor cap and updated the old school BG gear and made it so it was only purchasable through load of honor points and was completely unrelated to arena stuff, different titles and all. So that way ppl that like to do arena will have arena gear, and BGers will have BG gear. im sure there are moer things that would have to be worked out, but i wish it was something on the lines of this</div></div><hr />

The random BG que should make getting into a BG quicker just like the Random LFD made it faster to find heroic groups.<br />
<br />
Now instead of a bunch of people spread out over six BG ques, you'll have them all feeding from one que. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, for the people that say this just encourages HK farming, learn to read.<br />
All honor awards, like capturing a flag are based on HK's. At level 80 it's about 62 honor for each HK. So say capturing the flag gives 10 Bonus HK's worth of honor. It'll now be doubled the amount of honor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, the reason people get varying amounts, even at level 80 vs level 80 is several reasons. If you are in a group, the amount of honor you get is spread out to all members in range, just like when leveling in Pve. If not in a group, you get honor based on how much damage you did to the target.<br />
<br />
If you killed him solo from 100% to 0, you get the full honor. But if someone else helped, it's split. Or he takes falling damage, or is already hurt, or is also being attacked by a mob, etc etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To bring the rate at which players obtain PvP rewards with Honor more in-line with the rate at which players obtain PvE rewards via the Dungeon Finder, we'll also be increasing the amount of Honor awarded for an Honorable Kill by 100%. In light of this, the amount of experience provided from an Honorable Kill, and the amount of Honor awarded for completing the Wintergrasp weekly quests, have been reduced by 50%.<br />
<br />
It's important to note one thing about these 50% decreases. All Honor awarded for completing objectives in Battlegrounds and Wintergrasp is actually based on an Honorable Kill conversion rate. So if you destroy a tower in Alterac Valley for example, the Honor you're awarded is actually based on a flat number of Honorable Kills. Since Honorable Kills will now award 100% more Honor, completing such objectives will also award more Honor. This is why experience gains based on completing Battleground objectives and Honor awarded from the Wintergrasp quests are being decreased by 50%.&lt;/li&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you kidding me?<br />
I am on Vindication EU.. As Horde the average wait time for WSG is approximatly 10 minutes, 15 minutes per AB and upto 2-3 hours for AV/SOTA/IOC/EOTS, And you're telling me that the only certain gain of honor a week, is now being halved... again?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karaghan</div><div class="date">2010-02-19, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that 30 honorable kills curency equiwalent is not even near the amount of badges you get from random hc.<br />
For example the minimum badge amount you can get from random hc is 5 and average piece price is 50 badges so each run gives you 10% of badges needed to buy one piece. Now 30 honorable kills are equal to lets say 250 honor now so it will be 500 honor later on and pvp pieces wary betveen 40.000 - 60.000 honor so it will be 1% needed to buy one piece. Imo thats not really going to speed things up. The double honor from BGs will give you the same honor as it is now with marks of honor. <br />
<br />
On the other hand some BGs will be reanimated through that system. Like IOC or SOTA (which arent that bad, problem was in my case that when i was full of all other marks i had to wait like 1 hour in queue just to join it and lose in 5 mins 20 vs 40 or so)</div></div><hr />

There will always be a certain number of d-bags on your team which, after seeing the opponent tap Stables earlier than your team taps Farm (or the other way around if you're Alliance, though, I have to say, I always see Stables tapped juuust a few seconds earlier than Farm, even with a paladin on my team) or first capture a flag, shouts to &quot;just let them win quickly&quot;.<br />
And honestly, who's to blame them if this actually provides them with a better honor-per-hour rate? Three lost matches in a shorter time than one hard-pressed victory.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
what will this mean for the low level pvp-rewards?<br />
<br />
will they be purchaseable just with honor?<br />
<br />
Would be veeeery nice<br />
<br />
Indeed, didn't think of this. Honor isn't usually the problem for these rewards, even without commendations (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44115), but the marks are, e.g. see above. After the change, they will be a nice addition to your levelling process without ever entering a battleground still populated with the remainders of twinks!<br />
<br />
Since certain items already cost 60k+ honor plus marks, does that mean the honor cap will be raised?<br />
Would be nice even for me, the guy who mostly just does Wintergrasp to gain access to VoA and a few random BGs (I should do some achievements) and always exchanges his honor points for epic gems for alts.<br />
<br />
<br />
And you're telling me that the only certain gain of honor a week, is now being halved... again?<br />
<br />
If you read the other changes, you'd notice the overall waiting time for battlegrounds should decrease as well.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Supercool</div><div class="date">2010-02-19, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Mark change is fine and dandy. Absolutely no complaints there.<br />
<br />
Regarding the random BG tool, though, it's obvious they're both trying to emulate the success of the random dungeon tool, which is without a doubt the single most popular and beneficial addition to the game throughout the entire expansion, as well as bridge the gap between the present BG system and the planned rated BGs in Cataclysm. The biggest reason this won't be as big an achievement is simply that BG queuing is already as convenient as it has ever been. You can already queue from almost anywhere in the game at your convenience, and unlike putting together dungeon groups, BGs have never explicitly required a fixed group composition or trade chat negotiations. This tool will somewhat alleviate wait times and encourage slightly more people to enter the BG system knowing the wait times will be shorter, but it's no rated BG system. The rewards aren't any more worthwhile, and that's the single thing that is keeping most people out of the BGs right now.<br />
<br />
In short, this is a step in the right direction, but BGs need to go further. Bring on the rated BGs.</div></div><hr />

Like we win AV most as alliance but are screwed for the others...<br />
<br />
Why would I join the random bg, knowing I will lose most likely?<br />
<br />
First thing I should do is check the 'promoted' bg of that week (or weekend, or day, whatever the timing will be).<br />
Whatever it is, it will give me a bigger chance of winning because at least most people of my faction will be there too. Queue times will be short so many games either way.<br />
<br />
The bonuses don't stack, so I should take promoted bg over random every time.<br />
<br />
If the promoted one is horrible, should I take the random one?<br />
Maybe, BIG maybe, untill I get one win, than get the hell out.<br />
<br />
At that point, or sooner, go to the bg we win (AV in my example).<br />
<br />
Once you are at the gear you should be at 80, you do 1 random heroic for the frosts, after that you only do other random heroics IF you want to farm gems...<br />
Random bg's will be the same AT BEST.<br />
Most groups will go for the promoted bg, and most individuals will pick the one bg they can win since they don't need marks of all anymore for max honor turn in...<br />
<br />
What puzzles me is this: why not promote bg objectives more?<br />
The ratio will be the same as now, meaning the objectives will still reward LESS than hk farming.<br />
I have returned 4 wsg flags in one game, and ended up with second to last honor that game... and that's just one little example.<br />
BG objectives are jokes, Blitz before towers in AV, midfield farming before anything everywhere, etc.<br />
The new system has the perfect chance to set this straight, but no, they keep the same ratio.<br />
<br />
Same ratio because:<br />
objectives are rewarded based on a number of hk.<br />
That number is reduced by 50%, while the worth of each of those hk's is increased by 100%<br />

I would venture to bet that at least half of the justicars out there initially got exalted with WSG and AB with the mark turn ins... That grind is ridiculous<br />
<br />
I am happy about the increase in honor... I am just sick of getting at most 30 rep from a WSG, i have 44k HKs and I am not exalted with WSG yet...<br />
<br />
i had 77k HKs b4 i got my Conqueror =O Makes it more of an achievment ones you're done with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would migrate at the point that I have no friends left.<br />
Sadly a few of my best friends play here and it'd mean that we'll have to part.<br />
<br />
That said, I find it rediculous that we have Ruin / Conviction / Bloodlust and Vindication as small battlegroups in EU, and they deny merging these groups to generate better experiences for many players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will soon be attempting to save enough Halaa marks to get the War Talbuks, which will be no small feat, since large scale pvp in Halaa is almost non-existent. I don't want to start the long grind of gaining that many Halaa marks if they're going to remove them from the game.<br />
<br />
But still, the confusion remains. The post mentions 'battleground marks,' so I'd assume this excludes Wintergrasp and Halaa, but is there any chance those will be included as well?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Easy fix to that, and it's along the same lines as the Deserter debuff.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you leave a random battleground, you will be unable to queue for random battlegrounds for the remainder of the day.&quot;<br />
<br />
Problem solved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's my 2cents on it:<br />
<br />
Random BG just will not work as Blizzard intend. The reason? Most people dislike any battlegrounds except for Alterac Valley. They purposely do not queue up for anything except for AV, unless they need the marks. If they don't need the marks, they don't queue.<br />
<br />
Based on my PUG experience :<br />
best honor per hour = AV<br />
best honor per effort = AV<br />
best honor per gear = AV<br />
best honor per AFK = AV<br />
best battleground for playing the way you want to = AV<br />
<br />
That's why Blizzard are putting this in, but...at the moment, you still get virtually the same, if not more honor by just spamming AV all day long, than by doing the other BGs and doing turnins.<br />
<br />
This will not make people want to stay in terrible EoTS games for example, or fail Arathi Basin that takes 30 minutes for ~300 honor (if you are lucky). <br />
<br />
If you are in premade, it's different, but then you don't really care about doing the other BGs if you are in a premade. I simply cannot see people staying in fail battlegrounds (which 90% are) for a few honor, when they can just continue spamming AV blitz for more honor.</div></div><hr />

I like the idea of a random battleground scenario. I'm not sure which battlegroup you're on, but I'm a casual PvP'er (I avoid Arena like the plague) on the Ruin battlegroup. Oh, and I'm also horde. :( The horde SUCKS for PuGing PvP on Ruin. Alterac Valley is not good BG for Horde on Ruin, at least not until late at night when more people 'in the know' are running it. Before late a night, it's one AV loss after another. If an AV loss = more honor than X battleground win, I can see your point. Otherwise, at least on my battlegroup, spamming AV PuGs is NOT a very fun endeavor.</div></div><hr />

Why would I use the random BG queue then when I can just choose the one I Like to play.<br />
<br />
My God. Stupid changes are stupid.<br />
<br />
<br />
# Winning a Battleground using the Random Battleground option for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.<br />
# Winning additional Battlegrounds using the Random Battleground option after the first random win will award players with 15 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.<br />

They doin everything to make easier honorfarm, but thus changes still didn't makin BGs interesting, most BGs now is simple pvp gearscore test. <br />
Sad that BG is now playin for honor, not for Victories.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyno</div><div class="date">2010-02-19, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that 30 honorable kills curency equiwalent is not even near the amount of badges you get from random hc.<br />
For example the minimum badge amount you can get from random hc is 5 and average piece price is 50 badges so each run gives you 10% of badges needed to buy one piece. Now 30 honorable kills are equal to lets say 250 honor now so it will be 500 honor later on and pvp pieces wary betveen 40.000 - 60.000 honor so it will be 1% needed to buy one piece. Imo thats not really going to speed things up. The double honor from BGs will give you the same honor as it is now with marks of honor. <br />
<br />
On the other hand some BGs will be reanimated through that system. Like IOC or SOTA (which arent that bad, problem was in my case that when i was full of all other marks i had to wait like 1 hour in queue just to join it and lose in 5 mins 20 vs 40 or so)<br />
<br />
<br />
I think your a little off this change will bring hks up to something like 120-130 before they're broken down. This would mean you would be getting closer to 3600-3900 honor for 30 hks given by the Call to Arms or your first random then followed by 1800-1900 honor for the rest and 600-650 for losing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xenoie</div><div class="date">2010-02-19, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This won't change anything gameplay wise for PVPers. Those who choose to spend most of their time PVPing will still be competing against players who choose to spend hours raiding. The honor buff is nice, but it doesn't put PVPers on par with raiders in any way, which is what the are attempting to do here. Random bgs are already in effect. Who doesn't queue for two BGs and take the first pop?<br />
<br />
This is why:<br />
<br />
What if raiding was a ranked system, and if your rank wasn't high enough you couldn't obtain or use the gear that dropped?<br />
What if every time you wiped on a boss or died to trash your rank went down and could only be raised by successfully killing a boss in the current end game dungeon?<br />
<br />
It would suck, and 50% of raiders wouldn't get anything which is how arenas are currently. You don't even need to be good at PVE raiding anymore. Didn't one guild down the lich king the first day he was out? <br />
The only thing challenging is hard modes and you are not required to do them in any way.<br />
<br />
You can also currently obtain PVP gear sets by running heroics and raids by turning in badges of different levels. You can't obtain PVE gear sets from doing PVP. PVE gear packs way more dmg then PVP gear, that's a clear advantage. <br />
<br />
Either take PVE gear out of the PVP areas (BG/ARENA) or allow players to obtain PVE gear from arena points.<br />
<br />
Arena weapons are great, but how are you supposed to get them when you are forced to compete with players who have already obtained a weapon of that level by other means?<br />
<br />
Rated BGs will be awesome when guilds who choose to focus on PVP are put up against players with access to high level pve weapons, trinkets, and gear sets to mix in with their resilience.</div></div><hr />

They specifically said that capturing objectives yields 100% more honor aswell... We are looking at a huge buff to honor grind - twice as much honor per BG + nearly an addition 4k honor for first win, 2k for the rest.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HolyDKPriest</div><div class="date">2010-02-20, 02:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the implementation of faction transfers and LFD-Xrealm Heroics, a lot of PVP focused Alliance faction changed to Horde (prior to the undead racial nerf), or started avoiding BGs entirely and now farm mainset badges/honor in heroics.<br />
<br />
Whilst the overall population may be close to even, PVP participation is a lot more lopsided in favor of Horde on most battlegroups.A vast majority of battlegroups have Horde outnumbering Alliance considerably, hence why Horde queues are long and Alliance queues are instant (but Alliance usually starts outnumbered in off-peak matches).<br />
<br />
While the BG changes may get some people back in and may improve queue times a little bit for Horde. It's going to be a hard sell to what is left of a now minority group of &quot;dillusioned&quot; Alliance players that are now avoiding BGs entirely. <br />
<br />
Especially when its easier to move to a PVE server as Alliance and its &quot;still&quot; somewhat faster to farm honor in heroics than queueing up every BG only being outnumbered/facerolled by the overpopulated faction.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolex Snob</div><div class="date">2010-02-20, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yet not T10.5/75 or this seasons Arena gear. This makes gearing an Alt up quite easy. You try getting a full run of naxx going that isn't for achievements going, and let me know how it goes. Hmm i wonder how long you would last in the crafted blue PvP gear, with a quest weapon? about 1 second instead of 6 in last seasons gear. So why don't you go complain about things that are actually an issue, like no Achievement for not dying in ToGC10, no mount in ICC10, rotface having the same slime spawn rate in 10 as 25, or the lack of melee daggers in the first wing of ICC10, but there are 2 in ICC25, and 7 caster weapons. <br />
<br />
People having the 232 T9 gear isn't a problem, you can always get the T9.75 stuff to look &quot;leet&quot; all of that gear still doesn't get you out f the fire or help you max out your dps.<br />
<br />
