On this fantastic day of April 1st, Blizzard unveiled the latest addition to World of Warcraft: Pimp My Mount! (https://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/underdev/mount-p1mpage.html)!<br />
Tired of your mount looking like every other raptor, wolf, horse, kodo, or nightsaber out there? Want to spice it up with some armor plating, a few spikes or chains, or maybe even some flaming decals? Then Z to the A to the zzber (whew, that's a mouthful!) will be glad to welcome you to his shop where you can epic-ize your mount with some phat total pimpage!<br />
<br />
Coming in a future content patch, we plan to bring you a new feature that will allow you to alter the color, the armor, or add decorations to your in-game mounts. Simply drop in to Zazzber's Local Fix-'Er-Up, pay a small fee, and leave your mount there overnight. The next morning, you'll pick up a mount that is uniquely yours! <br />
<br />
The Epic Pimpage<br />
The process of pimping your tired old mount is quite simple. Drop by Zazzber's local Fix-'Er-Up (available in Orgrimmar, Ironforge, and Dalaran with a very special PvP-oriented shop over in the phrigid lands of Wintergrasp) and talk to our resident mount pimp, Zazzber or his high-tech redneck assistant Janie Sue and, for a small fee, they'll overhaul your hauler, tricking your tired old vehicle out into something worthy of the Achievement &quot;Pimp My Mount.&quot; <br />

[color=#0099FF]It used to be that whenever I rode my horse past the Exodar, the other draenei laughed at me. &quot;Silly girl,&quot; they'd say, &quot;get yourself a proper elekk!&quot; But now, thanks to Z-dawg's ultimate pimpage, those other goat-heads all wish their mounts were half as fly as this guy![center]http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/pmm3_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/pmm3.jpg)<br />
[color=#0099FF]The other trolls, mon, used to think I was strange for preferrin' my kodo to a raptor. But then my main man, Z, hooked me up with some upgrades to my sleek ride. I've got some shade even under the blazin' beach sun over in Stranglethorn and my kodo? He's pimpin' it out with his superfly hat!<br />

Maybe coming back from the dead changed me; I'll never know for sure. But all I know is that I've always loved my kitty-cat. Sure, the other death knights thought it was a little silly but now I fire up my cat's phat nitro-boosters and blast those death knights on dead horses out of this life!</div></div><hr />

Too obvious.... I mean adding a hat on a kodo and a turret on a tiger... come on...<br />
<br />
But WHY didn't they really put some options to twink some collors or a few MINOR details? (ofcourse not turrets and hats, but some chains or armor plates, or anything that makes sence)... <br />
If models are a problem, then at least collors would be something I am sure everyone would like to be able to play with. Anyone who played Guild Wars knows how fun it was to play with different dyes you could apply to change some collors.<br />
The idea on itself is verry interesting, and would be another fantastic gold sink. Maybe this April's fools joke could be a start of something.<br />

Let's just hope that this joke is their test of cheking if people would actually like the idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How would this be feasible with the current mount system. All mounts are considered spells. Say for example that your Great Green Elekk is spell 50001 and maybe that Black War Raptor is 60001. <br />
<br />
If you wanted say the Great Green Elekk to have some Northrend looking armor and maybe a new saddle and possibly a small Alliance flag... they would have to have spells setup for reach of these combinations of options. The same would go for the Black War Raptor. Lets say they add customizing and everything.. they would have to have added a new spell to the game for every combination of options. This could be daunting for a single mount if you had... say 4x new options. What about other types of mounts like the rays or chopper. Ok.. the amount of options is getting daunting.<br />
<br />
Now what if you had 100 mounts and had to create all the possible spell combos for each. Also, what happens to your old spell for say your Great Green Elekk and or Black War Raptor. Do you unlearn it to be able to possible learn it back later if you wanted to un-pimp your mount? Absolutely mind boggling amount of work. Yeah, if it happened it would be fun, but we would have to have a new contest... Tackiest Mount of All. This could be an achievement if you say added all the tacky type mods like a pirate ship sail, an umbrella, fuzzy plush saddle and maybe also an air horn. <br />
<br />
This little bit of logic shows how this is just not easy to do. Plus being April Fools today.. I was greatly pleased at reading this bit of fun fiction. <br />
<br />
One thing that would suck is if you could not reverse it. What if someone had a pre 1.4 patch mount like a wolf or a black nightsabre mount with no armor. Say you accidently customized it to find out you could not revert it... it would suck. But thank got again that this is April Fools day.</div></div><hr />

Lame joke not enough effort, or Blizz should be working on 3.1, or it is too obvious. Can Blizz do anything without people QQing? The April 1st prank is impossible to pull off now, as everyone is waiting for it. Read it, laugh and enjoy it.<br />

I love how last year, when they did a full blown joke (3 of them actually), there was endless QQ on how they shouldn't waste so much time doing such extensive jokes, and instead should be working on WOTLK.<br />

It really is a legitimate idea though. Being able to change the colors and such would be pretty sweet. Or adding boots and guns to the engineering mount.

Im kinda surprised they ran 2 April Fool's Jokes</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dakkuuan</div><div class="date">2009-04-01, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard's April fools jokes tend to stuff that would be good ideas...and they never really make it in the game. The bard class is a good example of this. Other games even have a bard class. The pimp my mount idea would be cool, but i think there should be specific mounts to customize...as for the 'dance showdown' joke, that is just dumb lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">peacemaker</div><div class="date">2009-04-01, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a 100% April fools joke, but for sake of argument... what if they did to it.<br />
<br />
How would this be feasible with the current mount system. All mounts are considered spells. Say for example that your Great Green Elekk is spell 50001 and maybe that Black War Raptor is 60001. <br />
<br />
If you wanted say the Great Green Elekk to have some Northrend looking armor and maybe a new saddle and possibly a small Alliance flag... they would have to have spells setup for reach of these combinations of options. The same would go for the Black War Raptor. Lets say they add customizing and everything.. they would have to have added a new spell to the game for every combination of options. This could be daunting for a single mount if you had... say 4x new options. What about other types of mounts like the rays or chopper. Ok.. the amount of options is getting daunting.<br />
<br />
Now what if you had 100 mounts and had to create all the possible spell combos for each. Also, what happens to your old spell for say your Great Green Elekk and or Black War Raptor. Do you unlearn it to be able to possible learn it back later if you wanted to un-pimp your mount? Absolutely mind boggling amount of work. Yeah, if it happened it would be fun, but we would have to have a new contest... Tackiest Mount of All. This could be an achievement if you say added all the tacky type mods like a pirate ship sail, an umbrella, fuzzy plush saddle and maybe also an air horn. <br />
<br />
This little bit of logic shows how this is just not easy to do. Plus being April Fools today.. I was greatly pleased at reading this bit of fun fiction. <br />
<br />
One thing that would suck is if you could not reverse it. What if someone had a pre 1.4 patch mount like a wolf or a black nightsabre mount with no armor. Say you accidently customized it to find out you could not revert it... it would suck. But thank got again that this is April Fools day.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And that sir is why you are not a Software Engineer. How could I tell? ;D<br />
<br />
Anyway, it would be just like the barbershop, each mount would be linked to a single configuration which would specify it's appearance upon cast. Simple 1:1 relationship.</div></div><hr />

They used to actually be believable at one point in time.<br />

Yeah 2headed ogre playable class is believable.</div></div><hr />

because he's missing the game and needs attention on the net because maybe he realized his friends don't really have time for him in the WoL(world of life)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The would rank as the most stupid things bliz has ever done. AND THAT IS SAYING A LOT<br />
<br />
I think engineers should be able to build mechs. I took my dashi and solo'd 25 man NAXX<br />
ERRR well I just blew the fing place up...does that count?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dragonshardz</div><div class="date">2009-04-03, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The saddest thing will be if this (imagine) gets implemented for real... I saw like 3 April fool's jokes for each game, and if we count the dance contest as 1 for WoW... the horror. Forget just for one single moment, the boring and piss easy content, forget bugs, imbalanced classes, QQ this and that... would you really like Blizz to spent their money and imagination on implementing something so surreal and retarded... like they couldn't make something which will make the game more fun, like I dunno, making the bloody armor customizable so we can change the fucking color so we won't see our twins, triplets etc every time we visit the god damned AH...</div></div><hr />
