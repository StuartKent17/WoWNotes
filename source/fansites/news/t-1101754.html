<br />
Glyphs are looking pretty good, no more pvp or pve glyphs. They have some FUN glyphs that have no purpose in a raid but are just FUN to use outside of the raid or arena (remember not every glyph has to be used for raiding or pvp).</div></div><hr />

It appears that the glyphs have replaced a lot of talents. So I guess we aren't done with builds afterall. Now there will be glyph builds instead of talent builds.<br />

I was just thinking the exact same thing. They've essentially just reversed the role of talents and glyphs. Seems completely counter productive. All the boring, +damage stuff got rolled into glyphs. At least minor glyphs have some awesome effects. I'd say that's the biggest win from the whole pointless change. (I was previously on board with, and excited about, the talent changes).</div></div><hr />

So Blizzard has alluded to the fact they want to remove some. Then they add these glyphs and add a bunch more roots, silences, stuns, etc. Why do they do this every expansion? They claim they want to fix a certain problem so they remove of the offenders, for example for Wrath they removed rng stuns that existed in TBC nsuch as Mace Specializaton and Blackout but added the Death and Decay fear effect and Starfall RNG stun. For Wrath they said they wanted to remove armor pen but gave warriors Colossus Smash and every DPS spec a bunch of new offensive CDs despite PVP being too bursty. Now the playerbase says there is too much CC, snares, stuns, etc so they add more witht he glyphs. Why do they do this? Aren't they thinking?</div></div><hr />

Shaman glyphs are a lot of &quot;You get this, but we take this away.&quot; Sounds woooonderful...<br />

I dont know whar Sinister Strik will change, but thats not like Glyph of Unleashed Lightning or Glyph of Flame Shock or Glyph of Lava Burst ...<br />
These glyphes are not even op, so why do they need to change?<br />

I know it's early on and that there are boxes missing, but I hope that we'll have the option to change facial features or at least muzzles on the Pandaren. The males look phenomenal as is, but the females are a whole other story. Their bodies are great, their animations are stellar, too. And, their faces are pretty decent. But, dat muzzle. What's up with that? If you google search &quot;chipettes&quot; and find a good pic of Chipettes from the new CGI Chipmunk movies, you'll see where the artists obviously got their inspiration from, for the female Pandaren's muzzle. It's so bad, lol. Why didn't they just use the same muzzle style for the female that they did for the male? Didn't they learn anything from the female Worgen debacle? They have this awesome looking male Worgen and then this hideous female version. I just hope we'll see actual muzzle options or facial feature options available with release. What do you guys think of the female muzzle, compared to the male's? I just got done checking out the forums on the wow site and realized I'm not alone in this. I saw that and had just got done seeing the new Chipmunk movie with my little niece and was like &quot;whoah,&quot; because they were identical. So silly.</div></div><hr />

But, it doesn't seem like my first reply went through. I think the changes to the creation screen look amazing. And, the Pandaren look so incredible, too. I'm just wondering, do you think one of the missing option boxes will be for face or facial feature changes, including the muzzle? Because, I think the male Pandaren actually look perfect as is. But, while the female's animation is stellar, her body is great, and her face is pretty okay, dat muzzle is terrible. I just saw them for the first time tonight and as soon as I did, I knew where they got the inspiration from -- I just went to see the new Chipmunk movie with my niece and the female Pandaren muzzle looks exactly like the main chipette from the new movie. It's pretty silly, really. I have no clue why they didn't simply use the same muzzle for the female, that they did the male. Don't they want them to look similar? I hope that they'll give us muzzle options or facial feature options with release. What do you guys think? I just went on the wow site and realized I'm not alone in this, I guess some other people see it, too. Weird that they made another odd female face. You'd think after the female Worgen debacle, this wouldn't happen again.</div></div><hr />

Moron#1: &quot;Hey, we just took all these really cool talents out of the talent trees...what do we do with them now?&quot;<br />
Moron#2: &quot;Hmm...how about we make them Glyphs instead?&quot;<br />
Moron#1: &quot;I like that idea, but we can only have a limited number of Glyphs, else players will complain about too many to choose from!&quot;<br />
Moron#2: &quot;Hmmm...ok, here's how it'll work. We'll scrap all of the useful Glyphs we currently have (Granted, that isn't all that many...) and we'll take all of those mostly useless talents, and turn them into worthless Glyphs!&quot;<br />
Moron#1: &quot;Sounds good! Make it happen!&quot;<br />
Seriously, whose genius is behind the Glyphs? It's bad enough that, in Cata, most specs didn't have a full complement of Glyphs. Now, they took all of the old talents, and turned them into Glyphs, and got rid of what little we had to work with in the first damned place.

Many other glyphs show the limits of the new talent philosophy: while a talent that increases X by 10% may be boring it is still needed. It may not be in the talent tree any more but it is clearly there in the glyphs and some glyphes will become mandatory in the same way some talents were mandatory.<br />
Finally many glyphs are downright OP in PVP and while it will be fun for those who have them it will not help class balance at all.For example with aimed shot you could already 2 or 3 shot anybody in cataclysm most of the time, I guess with the new glyph it will be 100% of the time.Is this for a contest with rogues as to who can kill an opponent with the most ridiculous short amount of time?</div></div><hr />

In that datamine there are only two good ones, Glyph of Icy Touch and Death and Decay, the others will be absolutely pointless. Blizzard seems to think that DK's should have utility, which is stupid since we are a damage dealing and tanking class, leave utility for people with useful utility, those glyphs are so heavily PvP oriented or just flat out pointless, like who wants to weaken their disease damage?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trubo</div><div class="date">2012-03-24, 11:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DK glyphs are largely pvp ones, though the 3 someone earlier linked have some useful purpose. <br />
Druid glyphs are boring for the most part if you aren't feral. yes, I know they need to make stuff for when bear and cat no longer have the exact same trees and all but they pretty much ignored balance and I wouldn't bother with 2/3 new resto glyphs. Make Regrowth's direct heal increased by 40% rather than crit chance and it'd be fine for removing the hot. As for Healing Touch, should just be all direct heals reduce swiftmend's cd. The Lifebloom one is nice for tank switching. <br />
Just like DKs, Hunter glyphs are mostly pvp oriented, but seem pretty neat. Pretty much rogues at a range now. <br />
Mages: Gee, I wonder what Ghostcrawler will be maining in MoP. <br />
Haven't seen enough information on monks to judge these. <br />
Paladin glyphs really just feel like they just took all of the current talents and made them glyphs. Ranged consecrate is helpful though.<br />
Apparently Discipline is the new dps priest spec for pvp. <br />
Never played a rogue so not sure how these glyphs will be, though the Shadow Dance one looks nice. <br />
Shaman glyphs are really what all the glyphs should be like in terms of getting something useful but at a cost. <br />
Warlock glyphs are like shaman glyphs for the above reason. <br />
Lastly, for warriors, Cleaving looks incredible. Too bad the majority of the glyphs are worthless things such as Bloody Healing, Murder of Crows, Burning Anger, etc.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah &quot;Increases damage of ability X by Y%&quot;, those were totally useful glyphs that were fun to choose and it I mean the reason this wasn't baseline is pretty clear...wait no it isn't. That's the exact same reason the old talent system was a bloated load of feel-good clicks that actually didn't matter and could essentially have been baseline too.</div></div><hr />
