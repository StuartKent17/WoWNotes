Allied Races<br />
<br />
Players attempting to complete the Mag'har and Zandalari Troll Allied Race unlocks at the same time are now able to speak to Oculeth in the Great Seal.<br />
Kul Tiran Druids and Shamans are now able to complete quests in Northshire Abbey.<br />
Fixed an issue that caused the stun component of Kul Tirans’ Haymaker to ignore diminishing returns and effects that reduce the duration of stuns.<br />
Zandalari Troll Mages now benefit from Embrace of Paku.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Corrected issues with balance updates from Tides of Vengeance that were missing from this week’s update, including a Marksmanship Hunter damage increase and changes to the Equipoise and Replicating Shadows Azerite Traits.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Fixed issues with this week’s update that caused several bosses in previous expansion content to behave in unexpected ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug preventing players from entering portals spawned during invasions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue with items such as Monel-Hardened Shield that caused them to be unequippable.<br />
Fixed a bug that caused Incandescent Sliver to have too little Mastery, and fixed an issue preventing the sliver from working as intended near an ally in the outdoor world.<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
Roiling Storm will no longer grant you Stormbringer (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/201845-stormbringer) while out of combat and can no longer trigger Stormbringer in less than 20-second intervals. It will now grant you Stormbringer as soon as you enter combat.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: Our intention is for this trait to provide the same combat effectiveness, but to avoid putting a spell visual on your screen everywhere you go.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />

On “Atal’Dazar: Not All That Glitters…”, Alliance players should now be able to go to Atal'Dazar and collect an Eye of Dazar on non-Mythic Keystone difficulties.<br />

Flynn Fairwind should again drunkenly move along as expected during &quot;Lovesick and Lost&quot;.<br />
Fixed an issue where players who abandoned &quot;Homeward Bound&quot; could have difficulty re-accepting it. An Image of Mimiron just outside Ulduar now also offers the quest.<br />
Players can no longer access &quot;Paid in Blood&quot; while in the pre-wound version of Silithus.<br />
Fixed a bug preventing players from targeting Ritssyn while &quot;Rebuilding the Council&quot;.<br />

<br />
Seems to be a general thing. The tortolla shell game is also having a major flash compared to normal after the patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could anyone clarify this for me? So the damage increase was already in-game but wasn't documented in a hotfix? or it was in a hotfix, but never made it live? What was increased? Specific abilities?</div></div><hr />

The point is that most of these bugs were reported during the PTR and... weren't fixed.</div></div><hr />

Just the campaign would have made sense, but this is ridiculous. I literally can see the achievements all done minus the campaign ones which would make sense because they said that would still be a requirement.</div></div><hr />

I would like to know as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a priority queue for bugfixes. These were obviously lower priority.</div></div><hr />

It was starting to get annoying. Waiting for my queue to pop in Zuldazar was driving me batty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It made it live last patch, but the new patch &quot;reverted&quot; those changes (because they forgot to add them to the new patch), so they are now hotfixing the new patch to include those &quot;new&quot; old changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
The point is that most of these bugs were reported during the PTR and... weren't fixed.<br />
<br />
They are now fixed tho, so it means they actually worked to have them fixed. Just not in time for patch day. Not a terrible thing, right? Or are we now complaining about them fixing bugs too?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatakau</div><div class="date">2019-03-15, 03:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just play wow from wow.exe not from the battlenet launcher. What is annoying i then having to close wow, then open bnet, then bnet has to update then restart before it even gets to starting getting the patch downloading. Think this last patch is sitting at 6.1gb so far rounded up.</div></div><hr />
