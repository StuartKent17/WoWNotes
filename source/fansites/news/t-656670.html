...don't the horde plate sets remind you a lot of the Tier 6 armor for warriors?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">syvas</div><div class="date">2009-07-12, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">over the past week we've seen a steady introduction of t9 sets being released.<br />
I'm not really one for complaining, but in my opinion Blizzard has really let itself down here.<br />
I didn't really like the concept of classes that shared the same armour types sharing item models, but what's worse is the fact that many of the models are horrible anyway!<br />
I don't mind the Alliance plate models, nor really the horde plate (though I can think of many sets that are nicer to look a =P). These sets are meant to reflect our faction, though the Blood Elf Paladin set seems to differ in many ways from the DK and Warrior set, this is a painful reflection on the blood knights... why not aim for something more T2???<br />
It's no secret t2 pally happens to be one of the most popular (looks-wise).<br />
<br />
You no take candle =(</div></div><hr />

For horde pallies, you forget:<br />

<br />
If you look at the alliance sets, it's even worse. They are so similar, you have to do a double take to make sure you didn't mistake a clothie for a plate class. There's not even a uniqueness going from one armor class to another. At least the armor classes in the Sunwell tier could be differentiated. Even the color palletes helped more, between the classes in the armor class.<br />
<br />
It's almost like army issue issue equipment as opposed to the armor of a fantasy hero. These armors don't differentiate the individual from the rest of the crowd as being unique and powerful. They could just as well be the armors you start acquiring once you reach Northrend. I think anyone happy with these armors is propbably just happy their class/race combination doesn't look retarded.</div></div><hr />

Notice that the horde paladin is exactly the same as dk and warrior just on a very different race so it looks different. The colour is different yea but same model. They seem to have 6 models... Horde+Ally Cloth/Leather/Plate just a couple different colours and the odd skull tossed in here or there. Where the hell is this game going?

Well, I kinda agree with you, in the way this set fits only in sunwell.<br />
<br />
The fel magic and history of blood-elf paladins, as more light-drainers than alliance light-users.<br />
<br />
<br />
But its still green fel look, and horde paladins are definitly not corrupted by demonic fel energys.<br />
<br />
In my final opinion, this set would be awesome fitting to npc-boss in sunwell lore. Corrupted blood-elf paladin using twisted holy-light magic. Use change of looks of kaelthas from TK to MgT, and applz this for paladins, nice boss set.</div></div><hr />

T6 looked a lot cooler, though... :(<br />

I wish they'd start making those 8 piece sets again. That way everything would match, and it would have a more epic/professional look to it.<br />

you sir are an idiot. you wouldn't be able to hit 8-9k fol crits unless you were deep prot or stack spellpower for raids which is the most moronic thing ever meaning you are getting carried by other healers. please show me a pally doing a regulary basis 8k crits with stacking int into gems. even with the next patch stacking sp is worthless. yeah we are using FoL alot more and SS and less HL. 2 piece bonus sucks becuase we really dont need to keep judgement up .

I do congratulate Blizzard for not doing the Horde Pally the same way as Horde Warrior and DK, after all they don't &quot;share the same savage origin&quot; (or &quot;undead origin&quot; of Forsaken). So they did make it in a way to show they are diferent.<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
Sunwell gear? In fact: Silvermoon gear? Why not keep rolling with the Blood Knight theme/story line? It was very interesting (actually I always tought that they should have named the class &quot;Blood Knight&quot; instead of Paladin for BEs as they auto denominate) and probably would create a very good color scheme. Just look at the Blood Knights Tabard.<br />
<br />
Work the model with something like the Blood Knight Charger colors and it's aura, with the Silvermoon symbol on the chest like the tabard.<br />
<br />
Remember, they have pride for beeing Blood Knights.</div></div><hr />

I honestly dont want to see all plate per factior looking the same so, basically youll have 6 different colored plate gear in the same fashion. <br />
<br />
If blizz wants to name gear after heroes than make it really represent those heroes. Thrall is THE shaman of the franchise so if alliance gear looks horde-ish deal with it as Horde should deal with alliance like warrior gear as Wrynn is THE warrior. <br />

<br />
yeah would love to see you coming up with some ideas instead of bitching around, dont like it, dont play it <br />
<br />
and I bet the paladin is not finished yet as you can see every plate class has the same white smoke and also the white nothing under the shoulders, if they would change the green to dark red, that would be rad ! Good work on the warrior and DK plate though. And even if it would not change, remember that it will look 10x better in game (remember last tier)<br />

Overall, I don't like these sets. They are very much in the meh department. Kind of like Sunwell sets. Just meh. Nothing special. You'd think Blizzard would take this opportunity to make the sets belong to their respective sides like the old honor sets. At least an alliance/horde crest or something jeez!</div></div><hr />

You crybabes who tend to imagine how grass was so much greener few years ago, I made an experiment with my Rogue who has every single tierpiece (except tier 3 which is almost as tier 7). I dressed my rogue to different tiersets on random order. And after that I wanted them to name three best armorsets. I made the experiment to 6 guys one by one. None of them have ever played wow before and I gave them the opportunity to move the char themselves so my way of moving the camera didnt affect on the result.<br />
<br />
Tier 8: 4 times first, 1 time third<br />
Tier 7: 1 time first, 2 times second, 2 times third<br />
Tier 6: 1 time first, 3 times second<br />

If you stand back and look at it, the Horde Pally set isn't -that- terrible. From a distance it all blends together with a look that screams blood elf. IMO it was actually a pretty smart use of a color scheme. At first glance you don't even notice that it's the same model as the warrior and DK. Definitely more distinct than the Alliance plate sets.<br />
<br />
Waiting to see the Alliance Shaman set. I'm assuming it's getting similar love.<br />
<br />
All in all I like how the faction's sets across all the armor classes have a similar profile, especially in the shoulders. Silhouettes are very powerful, and I'm betting Blizz is deliberately trying to make a very clear distinction between Horde and Alliance right now. To the player, does it feel like the two factions have drifted apart? Not at all. Sure, we can't keep our airships in our pants in Icecrown, but that's about it. PvP has been going at the same speed for years now, even back when we were still at &quot;peace.&quot; Not to mention people always mingle in Sanctuaries like Dalaran and the Tournament. After 3.2 you won't look across the faction and think &quot;hey, a fellow warrior!&quot; Hopefully it'll be closer to &quot;hey, an Alliance warrior!&quot; Foster the hate!<br />
<br />
Also, I'm pretty much dubbing 3.2 as the Horde vs. Alliance (WAR in WARcraft) patch. New PvP, some fixes to old PvP, and a massive wall shoved between the factions in all the new PvE content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DK = Warrior = Paladin - chest piece looks a bit diffrent and colours vary from dark to light. Wow. Horde paladins look like some retadred toxic mutant. And suprisingly all horde plate wearers use same helmet as one of the previous warrior sets. New gear my ***<br />
Druid = Rogue - lightbulbs ftw. At least rogues dont get any other humiliating helm.<br />
Hunter = Shaman - I fail to see the logic here.<br />
Mage = Priest = Warlock - like &quot;omg priest heal me! What? You're mage? Sorry then&quot;. And what a coincidence! All this models for horde are not released yet. Well no matter because they will all look the same anyways.</div></div><hr />

yeah i see where your going at. 2.5k sp, 2.8k sp buffed and i hit 7k fol,its an ok bonus but could be alot better becuase of how it is now its not worth it doing 467 HoT. with set bonus 1k HoT but still your going to spam tanks on certain fights especially hard modes. the hot doesnt transfer through beacon so tanks wont benefit from it. if blizzard changes it then my answer is wrong.</div></div><hr />

On other note, good job reworking again another set, aka T6 warrior + bigger spikes = Horde plate. Nice blizz, nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well... you know what? I agree. :/<br />
Not the best colors Blizz have done over the years.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, ok... so the Argent Crusade is holding a grand tournament to recruit a bunch of new ordinary soldiers? Well I guess no. The tournament is meant to find the best of the best, heroes who are going to fight Lich King himself, not to be placed on the barriceades underneath his fortress. We'd like to see some hero armor that shines amongst the common soldiers, not dull uniforms, so Arthas would say &quot;mmm, heroes&quot; and not &quot;mmm, more cannon fodder&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for the colors of the rainbow... this is a game dude. You aren't camouflaging in the jungle, you're flying in on a fricken dragon.<br />
<br />
And this being a good post I'll have to agree as well. Although it WILL be an army, because it's not the 25 or 10 of us technically. It won't be lore wise. But you do have a point.</div></div><hr />

I was quite used to be a Mega Zord, or a power ranger, now I'm getting used to look like a red priest with a shield. But a paladin looking like a demon won't work. I'm a healer, I only play as a healer, and children will run away from me because it looks like I will suck their blood. We are a holy class, we just can't look evil and fel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They respected their promise, they are actually new models, but spread out to more than 1 class. They didn't reuse any previous model (non-tier or tier) to make them. And if i remember correctly, their promise was about not reusing PVE models for PVP , and not old PVE for PVE or anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Idk what happened with Blizzard, but i REALLY MISS the T5 and T6 times, T7 and T8 are not bad, but are really worst than T5/T6 design, and this T9 are very bad.<br />
<br />
I think blizzard just lost the hand on design, not just on sets, but on the world environment too. I really miss the nice look and immersion that we have on the old continents, Outland at least has Nagrand, but Northrend are totally ugly and bad designed places, not even attractive. <br />
<br />
And OH MY GOD, what's wrong with the ally sets? WHAT THE HELL are the DK and Lock sets on ally side? God.. i hope those sets are just garbage to hide the real ones...</div></div><hr />

^What he said and...<br />
<br />
2nd best looking Tier(overall).<br />
<br />
T2 takes 1st place (Pally/Rogue).<br />
<br />
Makes me want to raid on my warrior...and I hate raiding.<br />
<br />
These designs fit perfectly with the Coliseum raid/theme. I would much rather have plate all the same design with minor tweaks and color changes than have one good looking plate design, and 2 bad ones(or all 3 looking bad), even if they're unique.</div></div><hr />

...don't the horde plate sets remind you a lot of the Tier 6 armor for warriors?<br />

<br />
I really don't see where you're coming from. Personally I find the horde pala set to be amazing. he only thing that messes it up is the green colours. The design itself is really really cool. The helmet being the best. Make the green into black or even silver. Then we're talking awsome. I'm a warr btw:P</div></div><hr />

Horde Pally armor look like it was taken from a pool of dump. Alliance cloth look pretty generic and all of em look the same with no real differences. Horde Shaman look stupid, the shoulders make me lol so hard IRL.<br />

Someone obviously skipped art school the day they taught Color Theory.<br />
<br />
If you have a Primary Color and a Tertiary Color (that is an offshot of the Primary color you're using) you don't add a Tertiary color that is an offshot of the Complementary Color of the Primary color that is used as base. Red, orange-yellow, chartreuse in the RGB system. <br />

It's as easy as that. Some people will tell you that complaining gets you nowhere. I say that complaining has gotten you Tier 9. Honestly, it's not all that bad anyways. <br />
