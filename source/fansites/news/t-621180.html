Mana drain abilities<br />
The mana drain effects do seem to make more sense as a percentage than a flat number given how wildly mana pools can vary. The warlock version also seems lackluster compared to Viper Sting in particular given the difficulty in getting each of those off. This is something we're looking at. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/12065377584-from-the-pally-forums--drain-mana.html))<br />
<br />
Dispell Mechanics<br />
The whole dispel system in general is something we're actively discussing. Classes were not initially designed with a lot of thought into how easily their various buffs or debuffs could be removed in a PvP setting. We were pretty close to changing it a couple of times for LK but we had a lot of big changes already and wanted to make sure they got the attention they deserved before we started overhauling even more systems.

I'm pretty sure there are some sigils you haven't seen yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/12065328511-zero-new-sigils-in-northrend.html))<br />

Customization options<br />
New art for forms, customization per form, and even the possibility of showing some gear in a form is all stuff we are talking about. When we have a firm plan we're ready to unveil, I'm sure you'll hear about it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/11829579415-feral-druid-need-a-fair-chance-at-visual.html))<br />
<br />
Feral Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/12065146837-ghostcrawler--any-news.html))<br />
1. Feral Mana Pools are very limited, is there a planned fix for this? <br />
en you're in a form feels like it's enough to let you occasionally use that mana for something. We think you will probably still go dry quickly if you're healing a lot (which ultimately isn't something we want Feral to do a lot) or if you're chain shapeshifting (which is also something we don't want you ideally doing a lot, but recognize sometimes you need to -- dealing with a Frost mage perhaps.) <br />
<br />
2. Protector of the Pack limitation mechanic - not very fun, what was the thinking behind this and can the limitation be removed? <br />
I've avoided this debate for a long time because it seems to really, really upset people that they can't do something they really, really want to do in a very niche case. Bear isn't designed to be something you run around solo to kill things in, and even if you want to do so anyway, your damage reduction shouldn't be a big deal. It's designed as a tanking talent and &quot;solo tanking&quot; is sort of nonsensical. Bear itself works fine without it, and in fact you can even tank just fine without it as long as you aren't doing progression raiding. (If it affected your dps or something, I'd be a lot more convinced.)<br />
<br />
3. Feral talent point usage in resto tree, means we have to focus too many points on a non-feral tree, also very difficult to get all the &quot;tanking&quot; talents offered, no room for pvp choices in a tanking build - is this intended?<br />
We designed the new Feral tree with Omen as a trade-off. If we ever moved Omen around, we would also juggle Feral talents. We don't want you to be able to get all Feral talents and OoC. You can be a good bear, good cat, get good PvP talents or get Omen. But you can't do it all with one build. <br />
<br />
4. Swipe / Thorns combo (360') Aoe. Is it possible to get a 360' upgrade to our bear form aoe ability? <br />
We don't think too many druids are having trouble using Swipe in its new form. A little difference among class abilities that are otherwise very similar is probably good for the game. <br />
<br />
5. Feral Itemization issue 1: Too much Armor on some earlier tanking weapons compared to 25 man naxx gear is this intended? <br />
Do you mean you're going to keep using the older weapon instead of the Naxx bear staff?<br />
<br />
6. Feral Itemization issue 2: Not enough &quot;Armor&quot; trinkets in game making them invaluable to druids, basically once you have these trinkets you will not grab anything else unless you reach armor cap. - Can more armor trinkets be added, with different usage stats?<br />
My suspicion is you are still over-valuing armor compared to other defensive stats. I realize you don't want block or parry but that doesn't mean it's armor or nothing. <br />
<br />
7. Feral Itemization issue 3: Tanking gear - PVP gear seems to be better for tanking, more stam, why is this the case?<br />
PvP gear pays a lot more of its item budget on resilience than it did in BC so you're going to be giving up something else (like Agi) to use it. Also make sure you are comparing PvP gear to PvE gear of the same item level. <br />
<br />
8. Kitty AOE - Kitty form basically has no aoe ability, which limits damage output in multiple mob situations - we would have to switch to bear / caster which would mean taking a chance on pulling aggro or doing minimal damage with hurricane. Are there plans to add kitty form aoe?<br />
Hurricane and Swipe do pretty good AE, certainly better than rogues have (on which cat was modeled). <br />
<br />
9. Cat charge being linked to Bear charge. - Why is this the intended mechanic for these two attacks?<br />
We think this would encourage quickly shifting from one form to another, which is something we have actually taken pains to discourage (RIP powershifting). <br />
<br />
10. Berserk - The current version of Berserk feels weak now that the immunity to all snares has been removed, and its cooldown is too long. - Is there any way the snares functionality of berserk can be restored?<br />
We thought it was too good if it broke all snares and granted such a great dps increase. <br />
<br />
11. Savage Roar - Is it possible to have it persist through shifting? <br />
Same answer. We don't want to add anything else to the class that encourages you to say go cat, use an ability, then go back to bear. Changing forms is cool. Changing forms to buff yourself in one form then going to another isn't what we're going for. If you're a cat and shift to humanoid to heal or decurse or bear to survive when being attacked -- that's cool and what the Feral design is all about. It's when you start to chain several shifts together that we get uncomfortable. <br />
<br />
I use cat in short bursts when I feel like the opportunity to survive is there, but this seems to indicate you want people staying in cat OR bear for extended periods.<br />
No, that's not exactly it. Using cat in short bursts is awesome. Shifting out of feral to Innervate or Rebirth is cool, even if you immediately go feral again. Where it starts to cross the line is being a bear, going cat to hit a button, then going back to bear to benefit from the cat button. Doing feral charge bear, shifting and doing feral charge cat is not what we want. Anything that starts to feel like the old powershifting (changing just to generate mana) is what we're trying to avoid.<br />
<br />
If it helps, think about it this way: shifting once in a small window is cool. Shifting several times in a small window is less cool. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/12065146837-ghostcrawler--any-news.html))<br />
<br />
Infected Wound<br />
Infected Wounds is a disease, so it can fail, which shows up as a miss in combat logs. Stacking hit should fix the problem if it seems to happen a lot. Poisons have the same issue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/12060536329-infected-wound-problems.html))<br />
<br />
Balance high PvE dps at level 70<br />
I'm not sure which quote you're refering to, but we measure dps at a point in time and over the course of several minutes (and even longer if it looks like a caster might run out of mana). For PvP we obviously focus a lot more on the short-term dps.<br />
<br />
Moonkin dps does seem to be pretty high right now on Live, but we believe that is partially an artifact of so many groups AE'ing their way through the nerfed raid content (and Hurricane doing serious damage now). We'll have to see what the Starfire + Wrath numbers look like at 80 compared to our own testing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/12065277413-eclipse-making-moonkin-dps-balancing-harder.html))<br />
<br />
Healing as a druid<br />
In our minds, your go-to spells when healing anything bigger than a 5-player group are Rejuv, Regrowth and Lifebloom. You are probably not benefiting your raid the most if you are chaining Healing Touch on the tank while the paladin is trying to keep everyone up with Beacon of Light.<br />
<br />
Healing Touch, Swiftmend and Wild Growth are all very useful spells. But they are intended to be used in smaller group or when something unusual happens in a raid. If the entire group takes a lot of damage at once, that's a good time for Wild Growth. If a melee dps class is very wounded and you don't have time for the bloom and Swiftmend is on cooldown, go for the Healing Touch.<br />
<br />
Nourish is supposed to be a Flash Heal -- fast but expensive. It may be too fine a line for a class that already has Swiftmend and a (much improved) Regrowth. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/12065327434-gc-druids-are-fill-in-the-gap-healers-.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/hunter.jpg Hunter (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / Talent Calc. (9095) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
Aspect of the Dragonhawk and aspect swapping issues<br />
I do want to mention that it is currently possible to exploit the fact that Aspects have no GCD -- it is possible to benefit from Viper and another Aspect by rapidly swapping back and forth (which doesn't make servers happy either by the way). Our concern of course is that all hunters feel like this power Aspect twisting becomes the right way to play.<br />
<br />
If we can't find another way around this, we might have to put Aspects back on the GCD or make the shared cooldown a lot longer than 1 sec. Other solutions (like Viper doesn't kick in for 10 sec or whatever) also seem, well, bleh.<br />
<br />
We're hoping this isn't as big a problem now that you don't need to swap to Monkey immediately once you have Dragonhawk. But I did want you all to be aware of the problem. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/12065148728-how-are-people-liking-dragonhawk.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/mage.jpg Mage (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=670) / Talent Calc. (9095) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?mage))<br />
Frost tree in PvE<br />
We don't think the Frost changes were a major PvE decrease for mages and their PvE damage seems pretty good right now. We do still have some concerns that Arcane can be too bursty in PvP but I don't have any changes to announce there for the moment (and there may not be any).<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean there is no room for improvement in Frost. We would like to get Ice Lance back into PvE and it would be great to get Deep Freeze back into PvE too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/4/11829539215-i-3-ret.html))<br />

Judgement stacking<br />
Justice of Wisdom is not supposed to stack. We fixed this recently, but I'm not sure when it will go out. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/11829529171-hey-ghostcrawler.html))<br />
<br />
Judgement of Wisdom<br />
We're still messing with the numbers, but I think it's fair to say that Judgement of Wisdom doesn't give enough mana back to low-mana specs (Ret and Enhancement to name a couple). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/12065148937-request-please-hotfix-in-jow-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Retribution Paladins<br />
I admit that part of the reason I tried to take extra time to explain the changes we made to Retribution was because Ret has perenially felt like a whipping boy spec. We overhauled the paladin class significantly, and knew we were going to have to make some changes. Some of the changes also got announced in an awkward way when the beta was updated while the beta forums were broken. We also believe that mages have 3 strong dps trees, while paladins really only have 1 and we nerfed it pretty hard. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/4/11829539215-i-3-ret.html))<br />
<br />
Consecration<br />
I didn't mean to imply you have to give up Consecration. Consecration does a lot of damage. It's a good spell. But it's an expensive spell. If you're 80 and use Divine Plea when it's up, you should be able to use Consecration, heals and other spells, especially if you Judge Wisdom. I probably confused the issue by stating that our design was a paladin can use Storm, Crusader and Judge without running out of mana.<br />
<br />
When Ret paladins could use all of their abilities without ever worrying about mana, yes that was broken. I can see how it would be fun though. I once teamed up with a priest whose Inner Focus and Power Infusion got stuck on for hours when BC launched. We cleared out half of Hellfire. Then I reported him. (Not really.)

Holy and Discipline healers<br />
If any class is the &quot;fill in the gap&quot; healer, it's the Holy priest. Their strength is in versatility -- they have single-target heals, group heals, instant heals and hots. The standard (but by no means only) way to heal a raid is to have a Holy paladin on the tank along with a Resto druid, have a Resto shammy AE heal the group, and then put the Holy priest wherever you need them. We are also trying to get the Disc priest into a role similar to the paladin, but based more around damage avoidance than efficient, quick heals.

<br />
Linking replenishment to VT<br />
There were two problems with linking Replenishment to VT.<br />
<br />
1) We wanted Replenishment to have a duration of 15 sec. VT has the same duration, but with a cast time so it would be hard to keep the two in sync. You'd either clip VT or have down time on Replenishment.<br />
<br />
2) Having Replenishment work on VT ticks would be awkward. You'd have the same problem of not wanting to renew it too early and lose ticks or too late and miss ticks.<br />
<br />
Mind Blast is simple. Cast it and Replenishement procs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/11829509263-shadowpriests-have-no-role-in-raiding-proof.html))<br />

Warrior DPS vs. Rogue<br />
If you have two players of equal skill and gear on a fight that doesn't favor the mechanics of one over the other, then the rogue should do more damage. The delta is smaller than it used to be though, so very good warriors will sometimes &quot;win the meters.&quot;<br />
<br />
The reason we don't over-emphasize this design is players keep throwing up screenshots and parses of a rogue beating them and saying &quot;You said warriors should be able to beat rogues.&quot; You can't discount the skill, gear and encounter parts of the equation, as well as good old random numbers. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/12060686061-gc-rogue-single-target-dps--warrior.html))<br />
<br />
Sudden Death<br />
Sorry for the confusion.<br />
<br />
We were worried Arms warriors were doing too much damage, sometimes, when the RNG was in their favor. We attempted to fix that by lowering the proc rate of Sudden Death, but of course the RNG aspect just went up when we did that. We still might try alternative implementations, a 50 rage max Exectute perhaps, but we will probably not mess with it until we see Arms at 80 on Live in PvP and PvE to get a better idea of how the build is doing. (Note the adverb &quot;probably&quot; -- if we do end up changing it sooner, please don't tell me I broke promises to warriors.)<br />
<br />
I sometimes try and mention potential future nerfs or ideas for nerfs that we rejected, so that A) I'm not always bringing bad news about nerfs, B) If we do end up nerfing something in the future it may not be a total surprise, and C) You get a little more insight into how we work.

So far, the only thing I can assess from most blue posts: Well, we want to buff you...but by buffing you we mean that we want to take away the usefulness of the talent/spell/etc we're going to buff. That seems to be the trend for both classes.</div></div><hr />

So PVE can sneak in a little more dps? Because PVP wise, Aspect of Dragonhawk took care of the whole need for aspect twisting. If the warrior, goes battle stance, drop Dragonhawk, turn on aspect of the hawk. Otherwise what's the point of not leaving Aspect of Dragonhawk on?<br />
<br />
Seriously. If you can't wait the 1 second in arena to turn on Viper every few minutes, I don't know what to say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) the ability to dodge. At the moment, we're broken in this respect. Blizzard has agreed, and want to make our lives a little easier than having to toggle between monkey, hawk, and viper...which is why, atm, there is no GCD. That GCD takes away from our ability to do other things..like try and get out of the way of the folks that are mashing us because our dodge is broken and won't be fixed until a lter patch.<br />
<br />
2)The ability to regenerate mana without having to chain-click other things. We have a LOT of buttons to push. It's always been that way for us, which is just the nature of playing a hunter. From what I recall GC discussing was that they are trying to 'make things easier' for us to switch between aspects. So, dragonhawk = dodge(fixed version) + hawk; viper = regens mana. <br />
<br />
I think they said something about it being a 4%/3seconds (or roughly 80% over 1minute) regen...change. Personally, suiciding and waiting for the spirit rez timer to reset has more mana efficiency.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nubs</div><div class="date">2008-10-30, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) the ability to dodge.

Now this is true in live, but this is not the case @ 80. Aspect of Dragonhawk gives the same benefit as Aspect of Hawk as well as the same dodge as Aspect of Monkey (buffed to 18%). The only reason not to use Dragonhawk is facing a warrior, in which case leaving Aspect of Hawk on would be better, but otherwise, there is absolutely no reason to use Monkey in it's current form over Dragonhawk. The only arguement that is valid is switching between Viper and Dragonhawk, but even that is a weak case to make since it will take you a few minutes to go OOM with a few of the recent changes to mana cost for hunters.</div></div><hr />

Still no signs of them trying to fix us either, still bugged into oblivion.<br />

WTB some friggin fixes so that I don't have to log my alt when I raid. Despite going from Sunwell / BT to Karazhan level gear my alt still deals more damage :&gt;<br />
<br />
Oh and yeah, warlocks are not broken. Blizzard just fucked us over by making most of our new talents and updates bug. Haunt still has the wrong cooldown, Death's Embrace only applies to Shadow Bolt, Eradication still only on Corruption, Drain Soul (don't know if they removed it again, but it was on the PTR earlier) isn't doing x4 damage on targets below 25% hp, Shadow Embrace still only works for one warlock, minions aint getting our spell crit etc.<br />

The list is quite long now and the clock is ticking.</div></div><hr />

I admit that part of the reason I tried to take extra time to explain the changes we made to Retribution was because Ret has perenially felt like a whipping boy spec. We overhauled the paladin class significantly, and knew we were going to have to make some changes. Some of the changes also got announced in an awkward way when the beta was updated while the beta forums were broken. We also believe that mages have 3 strong dps trees, while paladins really only have 1 and we nerfed it pretty hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
The guy does understand that, pallies are a hybrid class while mages are a pure dps class?<br />
<br />
<br />
Which doesn't really matter since Blizzard is trying to make it so no matter what class you are, if you spec for DPS you'll be doing as much if not alittle more or less as the other classes with equal gear.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention the retardation that is conflag and blizz trying to &quot;complicate&quot; our rotation by forcing destro to cast 7 different types of spells at least once every 24 (to 28) seconds.<br />
<br />
Conflag is a PVP spell, period. Please don't force us to rely on conflag to DPS in PVE.</div></div><hr />

There were two problems with linking Replenishment to VT.<br />
<br />
1) We wanted Replenishment to have a duration of 15 sec. VT has the same duration, but with a cast time so it would be hard to keep the two in sync. You'd either clip VT or have down time on Replenishment.<br />
<br />
2) Having Replenishment work on VT ticks would be awkward. You'd have the same problem of not wanting to renew it too early and lose ticks or too late and miss ticks.<br />
<br />
Mind Blast is simple. Cast it and Replenishement procs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, this is major SPriest concern... VT triggering replenishment.... oh wait. <br />
Maybe for a change Blizz might focus on something really important? I mean,our usefulness got nerfed to the ground and all Blizz is doing, is explaining VT&gt;replenishment? I haven't seen one frecking post anywhere asking to change this combination. What the hell? <br />
<br />
It's like I am asking my boss for a raise, and he's explaining me how to get to a toilet in our office.... I KNOW how to get there, I DON'T NEED to be told why VT trigers replenishment. I DO NEED anything to help me being UTILITY class...</div></div><hr />

Aspect of Dragonhawk gives the same benefit as Aspect of Hawk as well as the same dodge as Aspect of Monkey (buffed to 18%). The only reason not to use Dragonhawk is facing a warrior, in which case leaving Aspect of Hawk on would be better, but otherwise, there is absolutely no reason to use Monkey in it's current form over Dragonhawk. The only arguement that is valid is switching between Viper and Dragonhawk, but even that is a weak case to make since it will take you a few minutes to go OOM with a few of the recent changes to mana cost for hunters.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's true, sorry about the late response...Overpower is a NASTY one. BUT, overpower is 8seconds cooldown, correct?<br />
<br />
Would +18% dodge be more effective than taking osme overpower dmg?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoceb1073a651</div><div class="date">2008-10-30, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You should consider the incoming dual-spec options. As soon as this hits, every hybrid will gain much more value then it already has now, as long as the equipent is sufficient for a given instance. Yes, specialist DDs should have their item set(s) completed faster that hybrids. But in the long run, hybrids will be on the winning side as long as the damage argument will not be in the favor of specialist DDs. (Mind the fact, that support/buffing is not important any more, so it falls out of the equation.)<br />
<br />
Personally, I think that every damage spec (no matter if it is one of the specialist-DD's or one of the hybrid's damage spec) should deliver an equal minimum level of damage concerning that the gear is on the equal level. Every surplus of damage should be coming from the special situation characteristics (i.a. AoE-damage, movement, ranged bonus, melee bonus, special magic school bonus etc.) and than be distributed equally among all the classes which benefit from these conditions. <br />
<br />
The skill of a player would then be: Find the best equipment for each spec, find the best specs for each situation you will be dealing with (incoming 2 specs), and use your skill in the best possible way (paying attention and such comes into the equation as well).<br />
<br />
So, leave the Ret enough damage to be comparable to the minimum level. Give them the special Paladin bonuses according to the class design (e.g. extra damage against undead). And don't nerf the other specs just because Ret comes out with too much power!<br />
<br />
(I'm a dedicated mage player if you wonder...)<br />
<br />
Addition: Blizz should finally realize, that this game needs a complete separation of the PvE game mechanic from the PvP game mechanic! But oh well, that's too much work...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've always maintained that Arena should be TTR style.* The TTR is fair, equal, and honest.* Live arena's are like an ePeen indicator, &quot;how long have you been in Arena&quot; measurements. <br />
<br />
I'm sure some of that will change with the advent of persistent personal ratings, however I really do love the idea of how the TTR worked.<br />
<br />
I think that if you still queued and everything from the live realms, then when you queue it translocates you the TTR lobby where you're your TTR toon (obviously you can replace TTR with &quot;live arena realm thingy&quot;).* Where you still get currency for your &quot;live realm&quot; toon to buy up some gears, but having a stat like resilience and then changing all the PvE mechanics around PvP?* A little like in Reno 911 when Jonsey sticks his dick in the peanut butter - you've got your PvP in my PvE.<br />
<br />
I never claimed to be some uber elite arena meister, but I will admit the couple of times I started getting a groove on I'd meet up against a team that had at least a full brutal partner.. warrior or healer.. and just sink my rating =) So I gave up on arena and just do BGs as losing can still at least be &quot;Fun&quot;. I would usually meet up with this team around the 1680 bracket. Weaksauce, I know, but again my resilience never got much higher than 250.. Arena is fun, but stacked teams are the bane of it's entertainment factor.. it's obvious that it's a friend helping out another friend - which is fine, I guess, it's just a shame to fight 7/10 games against one of those teams.. (obviously queue at a different time, I know, but sometimes I only have a certain slot of time when me and my partners are on where we actually play PvP vs. farm or PvE.).. so.. in all, I look forward to the new Arena @ 80. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have any idea of how well resilience is (or isn't) scaling for 80? I guess I could look up the PvP gear itemisation from a while back, or someone who's been following it can interject. But for now, it's off to work.</div></div><hr />

It's like seeing a heartattack before it happens but you're not sure when it'll strike; so it just wears you out.<br />
Sudden Death makes playing Arms fun, seeing big numbers- but it's not like you get to use it all the time. It procs, higher the crit, the better. Which, besides Bladestorm, gives the Arms tree a worthwhile point of even being played.<br />
IMHO. I'm glad they will wait until 80, because they should know, about midrange 70, our crit will be crap... saying around 25-35%. Compared to my 43% in PvP gear unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Then again, warriors are HEAVILY dependant on gear so.. we'll see if it's warrented for a nerf.</div></div><hr />

No, suddent death is still being changed to proc 10% on hit. They were thinking about nerfing it even further past 10%, then decided against it (for now at least).</div></div><hr />

Im not a warrior expert, but i think like every 8sec overpower can be used which is a fairly decent hitting ability that can only be used after your opponent dodges. basicly it gives warriors another ability to use on u.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yup, there's long been a discussion as to whether or not the 18% to dodge would be worthwhile for the Overpower ability.<br />
<br />
I think Overpower gives you the ability to hit that within 5seconds after being dodged. So, the warrior gets dodged and he hits Overpower. 3seconds later, he gets dodged and before that timer can run out he has the ability to overpower again.<br />
<br />
The question then becomes if it is worthwhile to accept an 8second hard hitting ability or if the additional dodge still makes it more worthwhile. It's one of those Random Number Generator things that make the idea of WoW being an eSport...well...not an eSport.</div></div><hr />

Actually, after 3.0 Overpower is on 1 sec cooldown for an arms warrior with the right talents so it will more or less be available constantly to the warrior and it has a 50% crit chance as well. Overpower itself can not be dogded or avoided. So anything a hunter can do to decrease the dodge rate is recommended against a warrior. With Glyph of Overpoer the Overpower now also has a 50% chance to proc on parry as well.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but however much you QQ you will NOT BE A UTILITY CLASS ANYMORE. GET OVER IT.<br />
