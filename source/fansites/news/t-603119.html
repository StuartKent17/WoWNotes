<br />
Rogues<br />
The overpowered poison bug has been fixed. <br />
Warriors<br />
The stance bug has been fixed. (Switching from one stance, to the same stance)<br />
<br />
<br />
New PTR Build<br />
The news will be edited to list all the changes, but don't expect too many of them, we're 5 days away from the release.<br />
The PTR is being taken down to update to a new build. We expect the downtime to last between four and six hours.<br />
<br />
There are no new character copies, no new pre-mades, and no new patch notes.<br />
<br />
Other Blue Posts<br />
PvP<br />
Something might be added to the Armory to provide accurate indications of qualified team numbers for each bracket, and possibly if a team is currently qualified or not. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2766101883&amp;postId=28557408255&amp;sid=1#366))<br />

2.3 Patch<br />
Warrior shouts and some feral druid spells can't be casted for free after a resurrection in a BG, this is working as intended. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856197212&amp;postId=28557112007&amp;sid=1#4))<br />
There is no plans for a free talent point reset in patch 2.3. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856006807&amp;postId=28557410732&amp;sid=1#41))<br />
If you're doing well in Karazhan, you should be able to go right into Zul'aman. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856007253&amp;postId=28557410073&amp;sid=1#2))<br />

<br />
Wrath of the Lich King<br />
There are no new races to let the dev team focus on Death Knights, Northrend, and all of the other features. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2856216361&amp;postId=28557408184&amp;sid=1#27))<br />

Stop adding things to the armory, nerf the 3 year loading time of the site just before raiding times.. yesterday it seriously took me 4 AV games to get the armory profile of a priest.. then another 2 games to load the talent tab.. I mean, this is getting out of hand.</div></div><hr />

Great, just great... This was one of the things I most anticipated: Finally I don't have to use blood rage every time I want to buff me or my group. Warrior buffs by now are very limited (cannot be cast on someone outside your group, need rage, max 3 mins duration). Now they don't even grant us free buffing in BGs... *sigh*<br />
<br />
Thanks, blizz, really great :(</div></div><hr />
