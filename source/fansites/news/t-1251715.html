It's probably too early to tell, although it's probably still going to get nerfed. I assume they're just clarifying it so someone playing the game can just look at the achievement and know what that person did as they're kind of vague for someone that wasn't doing the content at the time.</div></div><hr />

Question is what class will be left out in 5.2? To me it looks like holy palas are in for a torrid times. Blizzard has ignored their feedback so far and seems to be focusing on other specs and classes. Another Sunwell incoming? Looking at the 2 and 4 stat bonuses - it looks pretty clear.</div></div><hr />

LOL.... all they just did was make Disc as shitty as holy. Funny part is GC had said this was the intent. Idiots.<br />
Both specs now will have shit regen. Disc just lost every advantage it had. See you at the bottom of the meters. They alrdy took mastery away from SPirit Shell so that spell won't be as strong by far.<br />

Sounds rather like Throne of Thunder might not be available right away - probably just a fixed time, but (speculating) it could also be similar to the original idea for the Isle of Quel'Danas/Sunwell, in that server progress through dailies is required to unlock the raid.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you do not play a rogue and shouldn't comment on rogue abilities? I don't have a mage, so I wouldn't be a good person to talk about mage nerfs and buffs.<br />
<br />
If you do play a rogue, though, you should know how to (very) effectively use Smoke Bomb in PVP, and PVE as well. This is a fantastic buff to a glyphed Smoke Bomb for PVPers.</div></div><hr />

You're obviously not a rogue. Even at 40% and 4 targets, its still a nerf. There's only a couple fight with the right number of targets for the new blade flurry to be effective, whereas there is a lot of bosses where cleaving is useful. Not to mention that the range of blade flurry is pitiful, and won't be hitting everything unless the targets are nearly stacked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in pve it's near useless, its 1 of 16 bossfights where it actually has a use, count a 8 yard raid cd, against a 40 yard one, i never have commented on mages, and i've played a rogue since vanilla, its very easy to see band aid fixes, or changes that only feels like they didnt complete it, its a reason rogues are the class that is still stuck in vanilla and have dropped over 2% in player base. but it's better than nothing, it's still under par with what other classes got, kinda like most of our abilities, just that others have better ones.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaley</div><div class="date">2013-01-16, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woops quoted wrong person. Fixed that now.<br />
<br />
Well, you quoted me. This is awkward.<br />
<br />
It's pretty clear the direction they wanted combat to go. They did not want Combat to be a &quot;Use this only on 2 Add fights&quot;. So they stripped the low target cleave ability of it, and granted it a buffed multi (3-4) target cleave.<br />
<br />
They're buffing Combats damage to be close to Assassination's single target, and they buffed Combat's cleave to be close to Assassination's FOK spam. You now have a true choice to play whatever you want. Not Assassination for 1 target fights, Combat for 2 target fights, and Assassination for 3+ target fights.<br />
<br />
Now you get the liberty to play Assassination OR combat for 1-4 target fights, and Assassination for 5+ target fights. Feels pretty reasonable to me.<br />
<br />
Sorry, the sky is not falling for combat rogues, and no offense, but to overlook the other combat buffs to make some kind of suggestion/point on BF being &quot;nerfed&quot; is stupid.<br />
<br />
I don't think I'm the one that doesn't play a rogue, here.</div></div><hr />

It's a damn good thing that the change to smokebomb is related to it's PVP usage. Sometimes it has uses in PVE. You don't see any other classes complaining about their PVP abilities being useless in PVE.<br />
<br />
Smokebomb is can now be used defensively in Arenas, instead of nearly being 100% restricted to offensive use / shutting down a healer. Now in addition to Bombing your own healer to save them from a ranged, you can at least negate some damage from the annoying warrior sitting inside your smoke bomb.<br />
<br />
And in terms of PVE, yeah, you can effectively use Bomb on Garajal, but this is certainly not the &quot;only&quot; fight it can have a use in. Think outside the box.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the whole point was to nerf the cleave. Combat rouges were far and wide the absolute best for 2 targets by a long shot. No class should be that far ahead for any sort of niche (atleast one as common as a 2 target cleave fight). And Blade Flurry really does not have that small of a range.... as long as the targets are all within your melee range they will be hit. I've hit targets rather far away from each other (tentacle trash on Zon'ozz in DS) by stand in between the two of them at max melee range, one directly in front of me the other directly behind me, hitting both of them still.<br />

I really do like this change, I'm pretty sure though it was an almost pure PvE standpoint change, since there was quite often very little use for it. Only boss I can think of would be the icelance chick (can't remember her name) in DS. This will finally bring rogues some raid utility! Now that rogues aren't OP in PvP anymore, they can change it without to much whining :P It certainly does help in PvP, but smoke bomb could always be used defensively before, just not against melee really. Dropping it while getting bursted by a caster team and your healer is in a CC was pretty nice. I've used it a few times against melee to prevent charge/shadowstep/deathgrip and the like, but it was very rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was good on Hagara, you're right. It's also very good currently for Gara'jal.<br />
<br />
We never needed it's usage on normal mode, but when we progressed to Heroic Gara'jal, if you glyph into Smoke Bomb to extend it's duration, you get 7 seconds of no one in the raid taking damage from the shadow bolts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No these changes are actual buffs for disc pvp. Disc never uses prayer of healing in Pvp. And by halving PW:S cost, it will greatly help with mana, because you in pvp situations couldn't care to much about rapture because people wont wait to do damage when your rapture is ready.</div></div><hr />

lol no that is not what made spirt shell so OP. Mastery stacking with spirit shell was the large problem. Made spirt shell unreal good.<br />
Spirt shell was (OP) because players were smart enough to use it before raid damage. Then other healers cry. WAH we have nothing to heal and our meters suck. Thats directly blizzards fault with the design...</div></div><hr />
