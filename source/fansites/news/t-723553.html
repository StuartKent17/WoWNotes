Located within the Twilight Highlands, the Twin Peaks remains a crucial point of high ground for staging effective and debilitating attacks against the black dragonflight and the Twilight's Hammer, who dominate this foreboding environment. And now, two previous occupants of the nearby city of Grim Batol vie once again for control of the peaks' defenses. The Wildhammer clan, architects and original owners of the once-great fortress city, maintains some operations in forested outposts of the highlands. The Wildhammers now call upon heroes of the Alliance to help claim the peaks and fend off the Dragonmaw orcs. The Dragonmaw clan, having spent years working to enslave red dragons, once again provides strategic importance to the Horde. As the Dragonmaw and Wildhammers fight for territory they once called home, the Alliance and Horde carry out the struggle to control the Twin Peaks.<br />
<br />
Capture the Flag<br />
Twin Peaks is a new 10 vs. 10, capture-the-flag-style battleground. Much like in Warsong Gulch, players must work to dominate variable terrain, infiltrate the enemy base, and steal the enemy flag, returning it to their fortress while remaining in control of their own flag. The first faction to capture three enemy flags before time expires will win the battle.<br />
<br />
Dominating the Terrain<br />
Although the Wildhammer and Dragonmaw bases are virtually identical, the terrain surrounding each base is not. Players will need to work to control an asymmetrical field where the mountain peaks are divided by a valley river. A single bridge over the river serves as a choke point in the center of the map; although deep, the river can be crossed. On either side of the river sits an outpost where temporary character enhancements can be claimed. In addition, tree stumps and rocks throughout the valley create strategic points for you to use line of sight to your advantage. To prevent absolute domination by one faction through its control of the enemy graveyard, the Horde and Alliance players resurrected in Twin Peaks will spawn from one of two graveyards per faction.<br />
<br />
Wildhammer Longhouse<br />
Serving as the Alliance stronghold in the north, the Wildhammer Longhouse hovers above the valley, atop a series of plateaus. With three entrances to the complex, players have two primary means of reaching the longhouse: scaling the plateaus to the northwest, or using the stairwell up the middle in order to access any of the three openings. Be careful, though! Falling or being knocked off the cliff can not only cause damage, but it can also hinder a successful offensive against or defense of the base.<br />
<br />
Dragonmaw Clan Compound<br />
Acting as the Horde base in the south, the Dragonmaw Clan Compound sits over a body of water into which the valley's river feeds. With three entrances to the compound, players have a few means of getting inside. One entrance on the southeast side requires riding up an incline and crossing a knee-deep river. A second entrance is through a water pipeline leading from the surrounding lake, while the main entrance can be accessed via a bridge over the waterfront. You'll want to be aware of your surroundings when you use the main entrance, though, because players can be knocked down into the water, slowing their advance or crippling their defense.<br />
<br />
Those who seek to control Twin Peaks will face an intense battle. The lands surrounding this ever-troubled location are key strategic strongholds of Deathwing and all of his followers. The Twilight Highlands are as rich with history as they are fraught with disaster and tragedy. Will the Dragonmaw clan, reinforced by Garrosh's Horde, take control? Or will it be the Wildhammer dwarves, reunited with their Ironforge brethren and accepted into the Alliance, who seize the peaks? <br />

<br />
this new battlegrounds will probably have the same exact problem now to be clear i dont hate wsg what i hate is that the battlefield can get locked with no clear wiener because there is only 10 people and at low numbers harmonization between classes matters more then ever.</div></div><hr />

It makes sense because of the Horde taking over Ashenvale where WSG takes place. Essentially the Horde &quot;won&quot; the battle for WSG after all these years.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping I'm wrong because I love CTF and the more CTF maps the better.<br />
<br />
IMO battlegrounds need more than one play-mode. In FPS games the same map ca be CTF, DM, Team-DM, capture-and-hold, etc. If WoW did this it would greatly enhance the PvP experience.</div></div><hr />

As opposed to... ? I mean, you play video games right, you understand how they work? What magical system do you propose?<br />
<br />
<br />
My primary concern with this Battleground... that screen shot of the horde looking over the bridge better not be the &quot;choke point&quot; in the battle... Especially with being able to stay mounted in water these days, there's just no way that a tiny little river is going to drive people in to fighting in the middle.<br />
<br />
LoS gimmicks work well in Arena because the goal is killing each other. WSG isn't about killing, it's about running a Prot Paladin or Feral Druid to their flag with your whole team, then killing their FC at the mid-field, then watching the Horde cry as you /walk back to our base.<br />
<br />
If I see someone LoS in a BG I just ignore them, the point is the objective, on the HK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah well, WSG will prob be deserted now at 85 :/<br />
<br />
Naw, not with the random BG system they have in place. Maybe at the start, when people will choose this BG on purpose because it's new. But that would be true of any BG, CTF-oriented or otherwise.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I think this one was a long time coming. Of all the BG styles that exist, capture the flag is the most straight-forward. And when something is that straight-forward, you gotta change up the environment a bit.<br />
<br />
It's kind of like ladder games of Warcraft III: the end objective is always the same. It's the change of environment that makes it interesting and different.<br />
<br />
I liked WSG most out of any other battleground. I'm glad to have another one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's certainly a benefit to LoS for the flag carrier though, isn't there? I mean, in WSG when you're running around your base, hiding behind walls and whatnot you're basically exploiting LoS. All this does is expand that sort of tactic to the field as well as one's base. I mean, it adds another element to flag return strategy beyond &quot;run like hell, and hope they don't find you&quot; or &quot;get that holy paladin, discipline priest and resto druid to escort you&quot;<br />

<br />
Gilneas for what we know will be a 40vs40 so it might be AV style but with AB rules, a huge AB i believe cause its divided in districts wich leads me to think it will be like that hope blizzard gives us a preview on it next week, maybe with 40 people we actually defend flags instead of staying alone and be zerged by 10 guys haha :D, its also a battle for Gilneas so controling the zones seems the way to go to win a battle to conquer something from the other faction.</div></div><hr />

Well, you could have this sort of functionality in AV if you were able to coordinate it well enough. The reinforcements are a built-in kill counter, provided the NPC objectives were ignored and you spent the whole time fighting in the Field of Strife.</div></div><hr />

With the added LoS, the (admittedly almost useless) central bridge, and the cliffs, this looks like it'll be more fun. The bridge isn't entirely useless though, as the FCs still have to use it. Because you can't mount with the flag.<br />

<br />
TL:DR<br />
<br />
- Asymmetrical<br />
- Wildhammer location is on cliffs -- 2 entrances<br />
- Dragonmaw location is on lake -- 3 entrances<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, this BG will favor the alliance. Their two entrances are easily defended as one is cliffs, which allows easy punting...and the other is a stairwell tunnel that is easily choked.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the dragonmaw have 3 entrances on a lake, thus making waterwalking a 4th entrance. No on drowns anymore because the breathing rate has been tripled...thus making zero environmental hazards for trying to enter this base.<br />
<br />
Also...capture the flag? Pretty graphics don't hide game mechanics. Can we get something new and interesting?</div></div><hr />

Not true at all, you never played WSG I assume if you make that assumption.<br />

This maps looks kickass. They should have at least 10 CTF maps. It's probably the best mode in BGs. Though AB mode &gt; WSG CTF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TL:DR<br />
<br />
- Asymmetrical<br />
- Wildhammer location is on cliffs -- 2 entrances<br />
- Dragonmaw location is on lake -- 3 entrances<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, this BG will favor the alliance. Their two entrances are easily defended as one is cliffs, which allows easy punting...and the other is a stairwell tunnel that is easily choked.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the dragonmaw have 3 entrances on a lake, thus making waterwalking a 4th entrance. No on drowns anymore because the breathing rate has been tripled...thus making zero environmental hazards for trying to enter this base.<br />
<br />
Also...capture the flag? Pretty graphics don't hide game mechanics. Can we get something new and interesting?<br />
<br />
Asymetrical is good. Mirror imaged maps might as well be giant fields with nothing on them and one big barroom brawl in the middle. While that might sound fun, it would get old very, very fast.<br />
Both bases have 3 entrances.<br />
<br />
I also notice just about everyone is either missing or ignoring that there will be defenses you can &quot;build&quot; at your bases. Pretty sure if you try to overlook those while playing in here you'll be QQing cuz they're tearing you apart.</div></div><hr />

When going up the middle entrance of either side, you can be knocked off. Horde smack into the hard ground, possibly dying from the impact. Alliance splash into harmless water, thus staying alive but moving slowly. I forsee a flood of horde tears because of this.<br />
<br />
Anywho, I am not a fan of WSG, but this doesn't look to be too bad. I will give it a few tries to see if this is better than, equal to, or worse than WSG. I look forward to the preview of the gilneas battle, as well as tol barad.</div></div><hr />

- I am relieved<br />
- ... for about a minute<br />
<br />
and then the same thing starts, with people running around in BGs with PvE gear (because a drop is certainly better than this vendor-bought stuff with ... resililience? Is that how you spell it? Resililience? Whatever, I have 12k dps so I should kill anyone in 3 secs right? right!?! RIGHT!?!) and generally not knowing their class.

I take it you never did Horde Onyxia Attunement?<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically the idea was...<br />
<br />
We're the Horde...go kill all these dragons. We don't care if we're allied with them, because we're the horde. Then, when you kill these dragons...tell the black dragonflight so they think we like them, and instead can actually go kill them.<br />
<br />

The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Deathwing is a common enemy to orcs and the red dragonflight...past deeds can be overlooked in times of dire situations.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nilinor</div><div class="date">2010-06-04, 08:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can think of a few battleground things they could have done that are better then this.<br />
<br />
#1. a WAR battleground: 100 on 100 with 2000 reinforcements. Basically fight till you win. You can grab new GY's to progress, and maybe secure supply lines to get your reinforcement count up. But a coordinated war.<br />
<br />
#2. Think Gunship, except on the water. Remember how the 2 airships fight in mid air? Do that on the water, have 10 on 10 battle between ships, first to destroy the other ship wins (you can jump over to their ship with rocket packs, to disable their guns etc).<br />
<br />
#3. Siege: 25 v 25 battleground, where you siege a stronghold, and kill their commander, while they desperately try to protect. This isn't isle of conquest or Strands, but the mix of both to a new BG. Each side takes turns attacking while the other team defends. You have 30 minutes to kill their leader.<br />
<br />
That just a couple ideas that I have, that are different, or take aspects from a few bg's and combine into a brand new one.<br />
<br />
That wasn't so hard.</div></div><hr />

It looks like military style positioning will actually play a part here. Controlling the bridge choke point is important. You can get around it by swimming in the water, but you'll be a sitting duck to ranged dps while doing so if you're close enough the the bridge or the banks. There's also some high ground and LoS advantages to certain parts of the map.</div></div><hr />

I second this. A DOTA style bg would be fantastic. I think at lvl 85 our heroes are powerful enough to lead wave after waves of foot soldiers/grunts against each other. It would be a nice alternative to the arena system with 2s, 3s and 5s.</div></div><hr />

If they're adding a new CTF map, I wish they'd take out wsg from the mix. That way you wouldn't have a chance of getting two strategically identical games when queuing for a random BG.<br />

<br />
Oh Garrosh you sneaky bastard.<br />
<br />
<br />
This bothers me as well, Dragonmaw orcs were our enemies in outland, they were enemies to everyone in the books, and now that were all buddy buddy with Alexstraza, it seems like a terrible idea to be friends with the guys who turn Red Drakes into show ponys. But I'm sure Blizzard just wants to give us a reason to hate our own faction leader even more. <br />
<br />
As far as the argument of &quot;It's another Warsong Gulch Reskin, Lame&quot; goes, I think its far better to implement a tried and true mechanic rather than try something totally new. I mean, look at SoA, it didnt turn out all that great. Also with rated battle grounds, you can expect to see small pvp guilds of 10-20 who just want to play the smaller competitive games. Props to the PVP guilds who can pull off the 40 on 40 AV games though, I'm looking forward to some awesome footage from those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well you have to remember that it's likely the Azerothian branch of the Dragonmaw clan, who are not Fel Orcs. They are the same clan as Dragonmaw in Outland in name only at this point.<br />
<br />
As for why they are helping the Horde, who knows? Maybe the Horde is simply using them as soldiers and has no intention of giving them any real power.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has stated that WSG is the most played battleground by quite a large margin.<br />
<br />
Anyway, almost every multiplayer game that comes out today has a capture the flag game in it. I think WoW does it better then most, FPS capture the flag games can be fun but I always found it lame how you can just get 1 shot by a sniper at any given point. CTF in FPS is pretty much just a &quot;run and hope you dont get seen&quot; In WoW CTF is fun because its a mix of actual strategy and combat, and you need to rely on your teammates to protect you and win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Day of the Dragon gives a good prequel to the events we can assume happened in Outland prior to The Burning Crusade. <br />
Dragonmaw Orcs lived in Grim Batol where they had imprisoned Alexstraza, forcing her to give birth to countless drakes which the Dragonmaw stole for their benefit. After the 2nd war, the Orchish horde had all but been disbanded save for small pockets of resistance, the Dragonmaw clan used the enslaved Red Drakes to maintain air superiority and a huge advantage against the Alliance who wished to eliminate them. However when the Mage Rhonin was sent to merely investigate the Dragonmaws operations, the leader of the Dragonmaw Nekros Skullcrusher at Grim Batol under the command of Zuluhead panicked and overreacted, packing up his operation deep inside the Grim Batol and planning to move north. His hasty decision was one that both Death Wing and Korialstraz could take advantage of. Once the Dragonmaw Orcs left the safety of their fortress with Alexstraza and her eggs on carts and wagons out in the open, Deathwing strikes, stealing many of Alexstraza's eggs. It's important to note here that the Dragonmaw and Deathwing have NO AFFIALTION at this point.<br />
<br />
Deathwing was stopped by the other Aspects who were called by Korialstraz and Alexstraza was freed. However he and the Dragonmaw escaped with many red eggs. It is unclear what happened at this point but somehow the Dragonmaw orcs made their way to the Dark Portal and in their battered broken state, swore their allegiance to Illidan who gave them immense demonic power, and thus the Fel Orcs were born. Zuluhead, assumed to be driven mad with this paranoia and rage gained the title &quot;the Whacked&quot; and set about to create an airborne army for Illidan using the mutated Netherwing Flight. However during their operation Lady Sinestra , consort of Deathwing, contacted the Fel Orcs, took over and used the operation for her own nefarious deeds. Creating an army for herself with the aim to avenge her children’s deaths in Azeroth. <br />
<br />
Night of the Dragon explains the details of her demise, and the failure of this plan. Horde and Alliance players Kill Zuluhead in a quest and the remaining quests give evidence that the remaining Netherwing Flight wants nothing to do with the destruction of Azeroth. <br />

<br />
Well the way I'd figure it being presented is this:<br />
<br />
The bulk of the Dragonmaw followed the very path you outlined. However, the Dragonmaw presence in the Wetlands at the moment, sans fel orc corruption, seems indicative of a fracturing of the clan at some point. While many fled south to the portal, there was a nontrivial number of them who remained within the vicinity of Grim Batol. THESE are the Dragonmaw we affiliate with, not those who swore allegiance to Illidan.<br />
<br />
The question still remains, however, as to why these orcs would be taken in by the Horde as we know it. I think in this, the disposition of the New New Horde's leader is much in evidence, although even if Thrall remained the argument could be made that these Dragonmaw are somewhat de-fanged compared to their predecessors and, like the Forsaken who were once human and enemies to the Horde, they would be brought in and adopted into the Horde once more.<br />
<br />
If there's one thing the Horde cannot really afford at the moment, what with the fighting against Deathwing and the Alliance, it's being picky about where its orcish manpower comes from.</div></div><hr />

I'd like a BG where you have to gather resources from certain points (3 different points) while under your control, could be one at a time. Any combat in the zone will slow down production by a set amount per enemy there, and they can cap the flag there to take it away from you (ab style). After that is met, you have to return to your base to pick up &quot;x-number of bombs&quot; to blow up something like a trading dock, a metal shop, etc. Let it be 10 v 10, and require 5 bombs to blow up the objective, only two bombs being ready at a time even, with the bomb carries marked like they would be carrying the flag. I'm sure I can refine my idea a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been campaigning for...okay, muttering darkly to myself about how children should be targetable/killable in WoW for a while now. A BG where we run around trying to kill the most children first seems a bit...interesting. But like, the orphanages in the main cities, that stupid kid who won't give back his friend/sister's doll...yeah, they should be toastable IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Only thing I don't like is aesthetic, the change of the Dragonmaw windmill from Alpha into dragon wings looks tacky.<br />
<br />
F'real? Hmmm, not having seen the windmill originally in the Alpha I suppose I can't say for sure whether or not I agree, but the wings didn't strike me as out of place in the Dragonmaw compound at first glance. To be perfectly honest, it was kind of refreshing to me. What with all the lore generation in line with the expansion and the novels, dragons have kind of been elevated to this &quot;godly entity&quot; status, where save for a handful of dungeon scenarios they were viewed as allies to everyone. I kind of like the idea of having a faction that treats dragons like tauren treat kodos, despite that understanding. So it fits to me...but then again the alpha windmill might look better with the general decor (which, I admit, makes the dragon wings stand out to say the least).</div></div><hr />

I think this presents a false premise: that liking the new BG in some way means you don't want new features. I think it's perfectly reasonable to assume that a great number of people who like this idea would also like a brand new battleground set-up. However, they keep the latter sort of campaigning to pertinent threads, and focus on talking about the actual BG in question instead.</div></div><hr />

That battlegroup shit should have just been implemented for Arenas, and not for things like AV, EoS and such.

I really hope this is not the only BG being released with this expac or I will be incredibly dissapointed.

But if they are packaging this as the new big bg...so dissapointed. <br />

I still say it doesn't matter since people are only interested in hks nowadays. People act like there is no objective in any battleground anymore, especially with AV and WSG.

Ivory Raptor is one of the original epic mounts which is no longer available to players.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
hopefully it won't be as bad as that. I think it's more that both sides have to go the same distance, it's just over different obstacles. <br />
<br />
<br />
What Blizz should make is a 15v15 death match, where each player has 3 lives, and it's just a kill the opposition. Those who survive at the end of the time limit (something like 20minutes) gets extra honor. And the side that wins by defeating the other faction, or having more people at the end of the time limit get lots of honor. <br />
<br />
Idk how to work out what happens once you lose all your lives, whether you just sit there and be able to harass the opponents while your ghost form or something, or your just kicked out. But if you did, you would have a cooldown that would last for 20 minutes (if that was the time limit, and it would go away once the game is over) once you enter that prevents you from entering the bg again to stop team hopping. <br />
<br />
Seems like it could work well with the random bg'ers like me, or the pvp guilds too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyways, I like the CTF style, and it's nice to have an upgrade to WSG cuz it's kind of getting old, and I've only been playing since early Wotlk.</div></div><hr />

GREAT IDEA!!!.... wait a minute, haven't we all been playing this same sort of game type since pre-bc... Sad. Now let all of you QQ'ers come and tell me to stop playing the game if I don't like it, pathetic nerds.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sycus</div><div class="date">2010-06-05, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was really hoping that Blizzard would just make a &quot;Slaughter the ______&quot; bg.<br />
Give 1,000 reinforcements on each side, and the fight lasts until one team scores 1,000 kills on the other team. =(<br />
<br />
<br />
I hate games with ridiculous objectives.<br />
I dunno though, at least this looks mildly more interesting than wsg. . Maybe utilize more strategy than get a druid or a protection class to pick up the flag.<br />
I don't really like the addition of line of sight though =( Prepare for DoT 'n Hide LOL gameplay.<br />
<br />
I'm initially dismal about the concept of this bg. Of course, I'm sure I'll end up giving it a try anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think having a BG where you go in there and just kill the crap out of each other would be a nice change of scenery. Also, someone brought up a DotA-like BG earlier, and that would be very interesting see if done right. In general, I'd just like to see a new style of BG that doesn't involve vehicles.<br />
<br />
One concern I have so far is the LOS mechanics being brought in. Both good and bad, good cause now you can kinda hide from that caster, bad cause now any class with dots can just dot you and hide from you while you die (assuming you're not a class that can heal yourself sufficiently) but we'll see how that all pans out obviously. Another is their description of the bases... From the sounds of it, if you get knocked off trying to get to the Alliance base you could probably die from falling damage... Whereas if you get knocked off the Horde base, you fall into water and take no damage? Lava please. But seriously, they claim the water will &quot;slow their advance&quot; but taking 60% of your health in damage will do that too (i.e. time to stop and heal/bandage/eat) but also puts you at a bigger disadvantage by being an easier target. Anyways, not QQing about a BG that's not even released yet, but from what I've seen that's how it looks. Like Xelios said, I'll try it when it's out just nothing to get too excited over. The new map is awesome and exciting; same CTF gameplay with only minor changes? Not so exciting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although i have 1 issue with the post &quot;although the Wildhammer and Dragonmaw bases are virtually identical,&quot; not only is this phrase incorrect due to it later describing the entrances to each base are different for each but also that Alliances attackers have 3 optional routes to attack horde whereas Horde have just the 2. Tbh i feel even if 1 of the entrances had a advantage there's way too many variables to try and balance each side out.<br />
<br />
Each base should have 2 relatively similar and symmetrical entrances ! its the AV patch all over again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AB= resources<br />
AV= resources (used to be about- nowadays is a zerg )<br />
Eots = Resources (mainly as you cant win the BG withh Flag captures)<br />
WSG = Flag capture<br />
Strand = Zerg esentially<br />
Isle of Conq = Resource + siege<br />
<br />
<br />
The resource Battle grounds out number the Capture the flag ones considerably and 4 :1 (essentially).<br />
<br />
Also it is almost Polar opposite to the opposite of WSG - WSG has a huge , vast , sometimes daunting, open &quot;field to get from one end to the other , twin peaks , well im under the impression , that it is a twisty windy , tactical bg , the opposite of WSG .<br />
<br />
The idea put earlier about a 15 vs 15 death match is basically a big arena.<br />
And if you are randoming into that , that is like pugging a arena team . ie . it cant be done . And would basically be pot luck if you won that one , with the uck of the raid composition out weighing the skill needed to win.</div></div><hr />

Think about the multiple entrances in the WSG bases... instead of going down a longer ramp to the side this one makes Alliance go through water deep enough that it makes you seem through... so basically anytime Alliance goes the side way they will severely be slowed down by having to swim out... That is way more hindering than the potential to fall off a cliff for Horde... I mean there's not even that many classes that can force you off a cliff anyway and the one's that can, the Horde has more of them so yeah... <br />
<br />
And the whole thing with the Dragonmaw rejoining the Horde is total bullshit as well... I mean these are the guys that are hostile to everyone in Wetlands and the one's we infiltrate in Outland to free the Netherwing dragons from... and now they are back in the Horde and still in the business of subjugating dragons? How the hell are the Red Dragonflight tolerating this? I mean their windmill in Twin Peaks is made out of red dragon wings FFS... And the fact that there is a large red dragon area on the border of Twilight Highlands and the Wetlands overlooking both zones so they could just easily swoop in and burn all those bastards to death at any time and yet they tolerate their renewed presence... /facepalm<br />
<br />
Yet another stupid instance of Blizzard making huge exceptions lorewise for the Horde to give them more assets in game... I mean they could have just as easily made the Horde presence in that zone not with the Dragonmaws and even fighting against remnants of the Dragonmaws so as to gain more favor with the Red Dragonflight but no... We get another storyline abortion like Garrosh... Is Metzen like focusing all his time towards Starcraft now or something? :-\</div></div><hr />

WSG is terrible with the new timer, its basically whoever gets the first cap wins the game, there is no come back, because there is no time.<br />
<br />
WSG is based completely on how many healers you have.<br />

This is suppose to be the first BG introduced in the next expansion? It is WSG with a different skin. And blizzard, are you struggling on designers/modelers? Why not make a indoor style battleground? where is the weather? why not snow, be dark, use night vision, lay mines, get new buffs from houses besides berserker!?!? If this is what i have to look forward to in Cataclysm, then i will not play this game anymore and wait for star wars old republic. All i care about in WoW is battlegrounds. I get off work, eat dinner , workout and in the evening i like to just log in and kill some people. And now its been what 5 years and I am gonna be doing the same thing but with more flowers and stones on the ground. Im sorry but this is really my last straw with this game and the direction it is going. <br />
<br />
edit: by the way i have about 500,000+ HKs between all of my toons and about 150,000 on one of my rogues. Its obvious thats all i do is pvp and if im seeing this as a bad direction im sure other hardcore battlegrounders will too.</div></div><hr />

CTF and CP (WSG and AB) are tried and true multiplayer gameplay modes. It's worked in first person shooters, in real-time strategy games, and in real life paintball. Blizzard has failed 2 years now trying to reinvent the wheel, and I'm glad they're finally going back to the roots of multiplayer gaming. The only thing they don't have is a &quot;push&quot; map -- essentially a CTF map with only one flag that both teams go for, and you must cap it within the enemy base (dropped flags don't return to the spawn point, leading to gameplay where the flag is constantly going from one base to the other until it's capped). EotS is close to this, but instead it's a convoluted mess that probably would've been more fun if they just kept it simple.<br />
<br />
Playing only WSG for 4-5 years now is akin to only playing 2fort over and over in TFC. More maps = more fun. Keep 'em rolling, Blizz, or even have the community design maps for you.</div></div><hr />

Thank fucking god, maybe there getting the point that all we need in a BG is a place where the fighting is happening. Arathi basin, eye of the storm, and WSG are the very best BG's by a HUUUUUUGE margin because of this. Lets hope the rest of the BG's they make do nothing more than give us objectives to kill eachother at, no more vehicles for pussies to hide in, and objectives that arent for the point of killing eachother. If me putting your punk ass in the GY isnt winning the game for my team, then the BG is a waste of space. You should be able to check which BG's you want to keep out of your random rotation to halt the misery so good PVP'rs dont want to log off the game after getting two Strand of the Ancients in a row.</div></div><hr />

In every battle height is a big strategic advantage , also in wow.<br />

<br />
also to the people saying that alot of people were asking for this please go back and reread those comments. most people werent asking for a new BG with old gameplay, they were asking for the look of the old BG's to be changed a little to fit in with the rest of the cataclysm changes.<br />
<br />
to the people bashing the vehicles, i actually like them. i wouldnt put them in every BG but it adds variety. if blizz want to add new BGs they should make them actually new, like a pvp version of the ICC gunship, or a dota like BG. if you absolutely need to remake an old BG it should definitely be AV, make it more like it used to be, back when it actually felt epic. when AV lasted for ages it was actually an acomplishement when you won, it felt good summoning the elementals and the riders. the only reason it was shortened was becuase too many people were playing it for the gear and not the fun so the complained that they didnt want to spend all that time for so few marks of honour, well now that we dont need the marks anymore where the hell is my classic av.<br />
<br />
to the people arguing about the lore of it, wait until they actually release the lore, then if it still doesnt make sence shut the f@ck up, the lore of wow is still changing, just becuase something was true in the past doesnt mean it will be that way forever.<br />
<br />
to the people saing that cataclysm isnt as big as other expantions becuase they arnt adding a new continent, you are fools, they are esentially adding over 2 continents of new stuff, just becuase its in the same place as the old stuff doesnt make it any less new<br />
<br />
to the people wondering why im typing so much, im tired and i feel like typing. sure ill probably read this back in the mornig and realise its full of errors and mistakes but for the moment its keeping me entertained. well it was keeping me entertained, now im bored again so im going to bed.</div></div><hr />

Yea this needs to be changed right away, always alliance favoritism, <br />
Stables is a few seconds closer than farm always have been<br />
Alterac Valley is no way balanced, giant bridge to get knocked off of by the defense completely ruining your offense? oh what do horde giant A giant LOS building for alliance to walk safely through.<br />
Now this map you got knocked off at the alliance base you die, you get knocked off at the horde base you cast path of frost and then laugh.<br />
