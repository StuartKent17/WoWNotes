<br />
I dunno. the dps on the entry level weapons is between end T5 and beginning T6. granted the stats suck, but the actual weapon DPS (~100dps for one hand) is in-line with drops from end of SSC/TK/S2 and start of the next level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this is only beta and a lot of models for weapons will change!<br />
<br />
And about them being boring and uninspiring.. I will have to completely disagree. The models are finally based on on something epic and brutal (Norse mythology, vikings and all, you know the drill)..Even though I also liked the BC look,I find these models more appealing..My pally will finally look like an actual keeper of the light and not like a purple power ranger :/<br />

<br />
<br />
From the previous update on the main page:<br />
<br />
<br />
Spellpower:<br />
<br />
* All items and effects which grant bonuses to spell damage and spell healing are being consolidated into a single stat, Spellpower. This stat will appear with the same values found on items which grant “increased spell damage and healing” such as on typical Mage and Warlock itemization.<br />
* For classes which do not heal, they should see no change in the character sheet other than new tooltip wording.<br />
* Healing characters will see their bonus healing numbers on the character sheet decrease, however, all healing spells have been modified to receive more benefit from spellpower than they received from bonus healing, with a net effect of no change to the amount healed by their spells. Some talents have had to be rebalanced to accommodate this change, but the amount healed will remain roughly the same. In addition, some talents will provide only healing spell power.</div></div><hr />

Marks<br />
Sting Based 51 point marks talent - check<br />
Double autoshot firing talent - check<br />
<br />
Survival<br />
Mana/energy/rage regenerating talent - check<br />
<br />
I'm a bit reluctent to take them as real until i see them in game.<br />
On Chimera shot the wording suggests to me it does damage based on the damage done by the sting in question and thus gives an element of skill in that you should wait until the last possible moment to use it to give time for the sting to do damage<br />
I wish they had made the low levels of the survival tree flow a bit better though, currently you are still forced to take talents that you don't perticularly want in order to get into the higher levels</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Umm, what?<br />
<br />
It's not like a big deal, I'll just get the new best items once I hit 80, but it's a big change from TBC and I doubt I'm alone in this. It's one thing to replace T4 with blues... or to replace T6.5 with a 78 BoE epic that is a world drop, but to replace it from blues a day into the expansion? Just seems a little weird.<br />
<br />
I always thought the &quot;gear boost&quot; from levels in the expansions was supposed to help the people who were undergeared get to an acceptable level, not to immediately obsolete the best gear in the game. Look at TBC, people weren't replacing Naxx loot until 80.</div></div><hr />

Yes, people did keep Naxx loot till 70, usually for set bonuses and the like, but it still didn't stop people (like you) whining like little girls the moment TBC gear from Alpha started showing up in screenshots (AMGBLIZZYOUSUXXORMYLIFEISRUINED posts on every friggin' forum out there). Equally, I'm sure your shiny little SWP gear will last you fine until 80 or thereabouts, so no need to feel &quot;disgusted&quot;, yes? If the gear change does disgust you I would advise you to not buy WOTLK since, surprise surprise, the process will repeat itself in a year or two when the Maelstrom xpac comes out. Deal with it...</div></div><hr />

I'm not whining like a little girl, if anything you seem more upset than me. My life isn't over, because in the end it means very little, the first month of being 80 I'll have the new epics, anyway.<br />
<br />
The progression of gear just seemed a little more extreme than I was expecting. <br />

Over it. Beyond it. i am the skillz0rz&quot; or what? honestly??(i even made two question marks instead of one, see?)<br />
<br />
it's <br />
-because people worked hard for their items(in some case, in most cases i guess, harder than &quot;i did this entry q you know?&quot;)<br />
-because they LIKE them<br />
(-&gt;most of 'em will most probably look much cooler than stuff you get 'till 80)<br />
- because they played with them, and each of them holds memories on how they achieved them<br />
(-&gt;more important memories than &quot;yeah, well i did this 72 q in whatever)<br />
<br />
and that's just the stuff i came up with without thinking<br />
<br />
edit: i don't say it's a bad thing and i'm not crying my eyes out like a little sissy; it's just that this ignorance is getting on my nerves. <br />
and yeah, ofcourse this happens, this is what has happened the last expansion, and what was made clear from blizz since the beginning.<br />
another thing that came to my mind was the fact that people would actually want to try out the stuff they earned against stronger mobs, out of raid-instances or something</div></div><hr />

Heroic Leap in the Fury tree - Leap through the air and slam down on all enemies within 5 yards of the target area, causing 50% weapon damage and stunning them for 2 sec. Bleh. <br />
<br />
Imo, these two should be switched. Bladestorm makes sense to be in fury and Heroic Leap in Arms...<br />

User: <br />
&quot;Too late, Experience, MMO-Champion's Spoiling has taken hold, I can -...-not control myself. I beg you Gaming experience, stall the spoiling, <br />
stall it before I know everything about the upcoming expansion. The curiosity rages within my heart. Must release it. Screenshots! Videos! Beta Diaries! Cower gaming experience before the Spoil... No! I must fight this!&quot;</div></div><hr />

- also from the screenshots, you can see Baron Rivendare in as an NPC up in the Acherus, does that mean no more Baron kills in Stratholme and no more awsome mount from him?<br />

Not titles, although blizzard might make an &quot;achievement collector&quot; title or something. It's just a little system to recognize achievements that players have gotten over their time playing the game. For nothing more than pride.</div></div><hr />

hmm i can partly agree with your opinion since EPL was a great zone, pvping in tyrs hand in stratholem etc. But since TBC its dead there anyway.. so do you really mind if it gets tweaked to fit it into WOTLK (DK's)? Im up for changes, nostalgia is in your brain :)<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
and im sure that the AD faction will still remain, if its not in LHC it will be anywhere else. I think naxxramas will again have to do something with that faction (didnt read about it, am i right?)</div></div><hr />

2. Instanced version of the zone. The zone is taking place sometimes in the past. Rivendare, Morgraine and many of the Naxx bosses make an appearance there.<br />

3. The quests still remain the same. Present time zone is just as it is on the BC live realms right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not like a big deal, I'll just get the new best items once I hit 80, but it's a big change from TBC and I doubt I'm alone in this. It's one thing to replace T4 with blues... or to replace T6.5 with a 78 BoE epic that is a world drop, but to replace it from blues a day into the expansion? Just seems a little weird.<br />
<br />
I always thought the &quot;gear boost&quot; from levels in the expansions was supposed to help the people who were undergeared get to an acceptable level, not to immediately obsolete the best gear in the game. Look at TBC, people weren't replacing Naxx loot until 80.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which items do you have in mind? I've checked lvl 75 blue robe and it was inferior to T6.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah O.O<br />
<br />
75 void crystals to upgrade to the 'tier 3' wand, and it only bumps up the wand damage and not the stats?* O.o It may be a high damage wand (who the hell wands anyway? :)) , but you can already get better/equal wands than statless 19 crit rating, 30 +dmg wands now.* Pewpy, hope each tier has a small upgrade to it (have a feeling they will before release).<br />

Um yeah, it does... because having them for a short time only makes it okay that they look like crap. Right? ::) That's your argument. Apparently anything that you only have for a short time (if at all) is okay to look like something a spastic 4 year old shat out. Most of the folks who play have some taste and sense of style.

They might have a melee trinket with X AP, Y ArP, +25% to all potion effects (bumping haste pots up from 400 to 500), plus a proc effect giving a buff similar to Haste Potion, but weaker (say, 150 haste), and on a shorter internal cooldown (one minute or so).<br />
<br />
Once again, just some ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I assume they are going to rework spirit to be used by all casters. Just an assumption seeing as how felarmor spelldamage bonus is based on spirit.</div></div><hr />

Both screenshots are of the same mount with different colouring. The Horde and Alliance versions have the same model, with a different angle.</div></div><hr />

Does this mean Pallies and Shammies will actually start to use Spirit?<br />
<br />
Nah, this means that druids will be able to use shields.<br />
<br />
Also, if that bike really is an engineering mount, I'm soo switching. Imagine a Tauren on this ride...<br />
<br />

<br />
yup, Horde are Rockers, while Alliance are those nazi &quot;motorized bike&quot; riders from the Indy movies, which are always shoved aside/pushed down some cliff.</div></div><hr />

it increased spell dmg by like 30% of spirit, it made me happy i was a human.../cry<br />
and yes i know fel armor now gets 30% of spirit-&gt;dmg, but i wanted that extra 30% and only for destolocks&lt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />
