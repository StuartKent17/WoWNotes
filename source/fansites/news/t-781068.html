<br />
Sound lag.<br />
<br />
Since the patch, for example on boss fights, I have major sound lag. This means that everything just happens<br />
normally, but the sound 'gathers up' and then suddenly WOOOSSSh unleashes all the boss sounds/screams/warnings/whatever<br />
in a matter of a few seconds. That's really weird because you can hear the sound of Frozen Orbs long after Toravon is dead for example.<br />
<br />
I'm really confused on how to fix this, I tried numerous things but nothing work.<br />
Anybody else got this problem? ( it's not only raids, but also sometimes with mounting/casting spells etc. ) <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowkras</div><div class="date">2010-10-26, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sound lag.<br />
<br />
Since the patch, for example on boss fights, I have major sound lag. This means that everything just happens<br />
normally, but the sound 'gathers up' and then suddenly WOOOSSSh unleashes all the boss sounds/screams/warnings/whatever<br />
in a matter of a few seconds. That's really weird because you can hear the sound of Frozen Orbs long after Toravon is dead for example.<br />
Im having the same issue, couldnt figure out if it was my computer or the patch.<br />
<br />
but they fixed the most important thing:<br />
<br />
# Guild Tabards should no longer display on characters not actually wearing the Guild Tabard.<br />
<br />
<br />
seriously......<br />
Personally? I hate tabards, most of them, very few look decent and depends on your class/armor. Im relieved they fixed it.<br />
<br />
<br />
does ambush still hit like a truck in low lvl pvp ?<br />
It alway hit like a truck, difference is that you dont need to enchant all your gear with agi anymore, or farm wailing caverns for agi gear. Iv seen 1.5k ambushes before on 19bracket, and someone was complaining about 2k ambushes at 49 bracket yesterday on trade.<br />
<br />
Dude, same here. I was getting wrecked in battlegrounds because I couldnt see all the enemies. and I kept missing extra mobs during raids because I single targeted thinking there was only one mob when there were two+.<br />
<br />
finally some peace.<br />
Get a nameplate addon and you wont have trouble with that again. Tidyplates was working fine for me since patch day. And you can resize/recolor/alpha nameplates at will.<br />
<br />
<br />
and more importantly the horribly slow flying mounts when ur dead...<br />
Taking 5-10 extra seconds from graveyard to the portal will really make that big difference? Sometimes people take 10 minute breaks between wipes reorganizing, repairing and talking and you get annoyed by a slighly slower spirit run? Should have seen the spirit runs from vanilla.<br />
Be glad you can fly.<br />
<br />
Now bugs i want to get fixed:<br />
- Not being able to shift+click to buy multiple items at once.<br />
- Getting stuck at 0% or 100% loading. But this happens every other major patch.<br />
- Boss abilities targeting reticule (the circles) not showing. I tried doing Hodir the other day and surviving was a 50/50 bet, nobody could see where the ice was about to fall, we tried enabling/disabling every single option on video and interface menus and nothing helped, eventually we moved to the other bosses and 1shot them all quite easily.<br />
(PS: That should have been hodir's true hardmode)</div></div><hr />

<br />
/sigh, what a disappointment.<br />
Only thing i can address is the bolded. I have been having an email back and forth with the author or Satrina Buff Frames, and that is intended. If you use any kind of buff frame or a raid frame that can manipulate buff displays, you can no longer right click to remove them. This was restricted to the default UI by Blizz due to a cheat addon that feral druids were using; this addon automatically shifted ferals out of animal shape if hibernate was being detected as being cast on them.<br />
<br />
What I would really like to know, is when my monthly sub turned into a beta key? Honestly, Blizz has screwed the pooch on this patch and needs to really get it fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard is working on it, people! Quite a few of the bugs you're raging over stem from your own addons as well. But, you know, couldn't possibly be your own fault.<br />
If you do want the game to get better, complain through channels the developers actively monitor. They'd never get anything fixed if they were to read through every single whine post on here. ;)</div></div><hr />

As said by many people already, inspect is working as intented, there are limited number of inspects you can do in certain time and your addons are using all these inspects for you.</div></div><hr />

If you've noticed, dc's happen when the game is loading something while minimized.<br />

Use &quot;fullscreen (windowed)&quot; mode. This way the game is never actually in minimized-suspended state.<br />
<br />
It's also awesome in Windows 7 — i can see a preview of wow screen when hovering it on taskbar, i can overlay the game with other windows, doing something while keeping an eye on the game. And even more, game maximize and minimize INSTANTLY.</div></div><hr />

Just rename your addons folder, login to game and try to inspect people. If it works (which it should) just start working through all the addons one by one to find out which one is causing the problem.</div></div><hr />

Just did and it worked for the first guy I inspected then never again. I even waited around 3~5 mins before inspecting the next guy without any addon.

also not being able to Que for Wintergrasp when it is not full, and the bugged graveyards. $15/month x 7 million subscribers = over 100 mil a month so again i say cmon.... 2 weeks was too long to wait for the cogwheel fix.</div></div><hr />

If your pet bug isn't fixed yet, deal with it, they fixed the most important things until they ran out of time, and will do the same again, every week, forever...</div></div><hr />

Blizzard just had a little event known as Blizzcon which had just about every staff member cept some server moderators attending to keep servers running. How much time do you think tech suport had to fix anything AND get remote servers ready for Blizzcon? My bets are Blizzcon was foremost on their minds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'm hating the bugs like everyone else but I agree more. Blizzcon was amazing and I don't blame them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two weeks in a row my guild has had issues when changing from normal to heroic ICC between bosses. And both weeks we've had someone somehow get saved to their own instance when we switched over.<br />
<br />
You are not the only one :P</div></div><hr />

BoA items are intended to be more expensive .. not a bug ..<br />
the inspect problem isnt much of a bug its caused by gearscore</div></div><hr />

yeah i have to say, the &quot;inspect bug&quot; is a feature, i hate it when people are looking at my gear ingame<br />
<br />
i hope they wont fix it for a few months<br />
<br />
or i hope for an option in the interface &quot;block inspect&quot;</div></div><hr />

Try 12million subscribers</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andy_mitchelluk</div><div class="date">2010-10-27, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What of randomly spawning with 1hp on a Graveyard?<br />
1) What of textures from shadow trap not showing?<br />
2) What of not beeing able to inspect?<br />
3) What of when you manage to inspect it jumping to some random raidmember? I have seen Fury Druids and Retribution Mages...<br />
<br />
1) Check &quot;Interface Setting&gt;Display&gt;Emphasize My Spell Effects&quot; is turned off.<br />
2) This is mostly caused by addons, usually X-Perl. There are the odd few people that can't inspect that don't have X-Perl though.<br />
3) That would be due to mousing over another player while you have the inspect window open. I'm not sure if it's an addon causing it or Blizzard's Inspect API doing that. It's done that since way before 4.01.<br />
<br />
Other than that I was hoping for the Gryphons to have been fixed. It's screwing up my guilds Halion &amp; LK Heroic attempts as it takes so dam long to get back on every wipe.</div></div><hr />

And when I can, some items appear not gemmed. Once I criticized a dude for not having gems on his gear, while his armory showed different. So inspect is broken, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fyrestarter</div><div class="date">2010-10-28, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wondering if i could get some thoughts here: i have one account, four toons. Main toon is able to loot etc. Other three cannot loot, cannot mine, cannot collect herbs. Blizz says dump wtf, cache interface.. been there done that.. did nothing. Been repeating this to them over and over and over. Gets me nowhere. I have dbm, decurse, npcscan, recount as addons -- have not installed rest due to continuing issue with looting.<br />
<br />
Am also unable to buy spices<br />
<br />
cannot leave an instance in boomer -- says i dead.. obviously no im not</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldrumr</div><div class="date">2010-10-29, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes! Blizzard fixed five bugs! Now only 1,735 more to go. I would have to write a book to even begin to detail the bugs that came out with the last patch. I have been playing this game for years, and this is the most buggy patch I can recall. Dragons don't flap their wings, spectral gryphons don't show up or are very slow, upon zoning out of an instance after dying you come out alive in the actual zone of the graveyard, can't buy cooking spices, can't use some skills, don't get the buffs for some skills, random disconnects and crashes, random high latency, characters at the Argent Tournament attacking thin air for no reason, running in place after visiting the Argent Tournament grounds, Auction House pages not showing up, can't inspect people sometimes... Just to name a very, very few. <br />
I know that Blizzard is spending a lot of time working on Cataclysm, but in the meantime, we are left playing what is currently available on live servers. These critical bugs should have been hot fixed the next day, and the rest of them should have been fixed with the &quot;bug patch&quot;. We are paying a lot of money to play this game; I would think the billions of dollars of revenue for the company could at least purchase us a stable playing environment. It's time or Blizzard to set a standard. This type of junk is not acceptable.</div></div><hr />
