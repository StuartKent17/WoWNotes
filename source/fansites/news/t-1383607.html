<br />
I'm sort of expecting to hear changes to Blizzard's subscription/expansion system at BlizzCon. For instance, instead of selling an expansion every 2 years or so, they can sell &quot;content patches&quot; in smaller, bite-sized chunks.<br />
<br />
Everyone will see mechanics/systems changes to the game, but landmasses/raids/etc. may end up as DLC. Imagine if, at MoP launch, you could've chosen to purchase MSV, HoF, and ToES (or not). Purchase the Operation: Shieldwall pack. The Isle of Thunder (and ToT) pack. And the Siege of Orgrimmar pack.<br />
<br />
Then, when kids save their parents' credit card info for buying content packs, they can also buy the pets/mounts/etc. and Blizzard will make a few more bucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could tell you where he got it from, but I don't want to get infracted. &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
This is definitely a much lower drop than I was expected. Figured it'd be about 250k, which wouldn't have been too bad either, but I guess Blizz has mostly plugged the hole for now.</div></div><hr />

Seriously 100k subs seem too little but it is the whole decline thing that I think makes them worry. Hopefully with the developers they got back from titan and now that they are free from vivendi they are going to fight back :) I have faith on them and they should start remembering their old good shelf...saying nothing is happening and everything is fine and we are still first is not gonna end well for them or the people who really love this game</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">excession</div><div class="date">2013-11-06, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm one of those subs, but I plan on coming back once the new expansion is released. <br />
<br />
I am glad it's not dropped too much but the wait between expansions all ways takes a fair toll on the user base.<br />
<br />
For me there are just a few other games I want to spend some time on and a new console to entertain me over Christmas and that's a hard thing to do when you play WoW and have a full time job. Can't drop the job so had to drop WoW.</div></div><hr />

But I kind of expected the drop this quarter will not be that high. I based that on game time tracked by Xfire and Raptr which I keep following for various games. While most people dismiss those apps saying that most people dont use them, also those same people seems to be forgetting about statistical sample. So far I was able to put pretty accurate (well, general in nature, but still...) predictions just basing on Xfire.</div></div><hr />

I think the closest MMO is FF14 with 600k &amp; EvE has 500k, some corrected me in another thread for FF14.</div></div><hr />

SoO plays a big part. I was even considering checking it out but I resigned becouse I dont have time to play more than 1 MMO at the same time (playing smth else atm). Still, I am sure many people did resub for SoO.</div></div><hr />

This game is almost 10 years old, and has a good 20 years left. Time to give it up unless you really want to jump up and down in 2034 when it does finally die. <br />

<br />
No. Sub loss/gain is a balance between unsubcribers and resubscribers/new players. So for random example they could loose 900.000 accounts but gain 800.000.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It can feel that way, but this realm merging they are doing should help greatly once they get finished. Look at just how many realms they are putting together already and it shows how bad/widespread the problem was.<br />
<br />
<br />
Citation needed!<br />
<br />
Does this work?<br />
<br />
<br />
I resubbed to play for about 30 minutes. Hope that helps. Won't be playing until the expansion amazes me.<br />
<br />
I had resubbed a few times in the first few quarters trying to get back into it; but I just didn't like what they did to my classes and it ruined the experience; and I couldn't latch on to any new classes specs enough. In fact, after a break and coming back the second time, I found it hard to get into it at all and I had wished I hadn't taken the break the first time when I didn't mind it even though I was getting tired of my 'daily' routine :p<br />
<br />
I have some hopes about the next xpac; but most of my hopes are for others to enjoy it and others to return to the game. I think unless they reverted my class/spec to pre-mists, I wouldn't enjoy it again (pre-cata would be preferred). I've also become spoiled to the look of some other games; specifically I'm awed by the atmosphere if FFXIV ARR (game is not for everyone), the lighting (dark nights), the style; the world is beautiful and I enjoy the play. Graphics aren't everything; but sometimes it is hard (takes longer to adjust back) to step back to something you loved (still love) that is dated. My best example is King's Field II; I LOVE that game, but it takes a few hours to adjust to run speed and PS1 quality graphics (and when it was released, it was pretty amazing) with blocky NPCs and limited texture resolutions.<br />
<br />
<br />
100k we will take it, still Q4 may not be as soft as we would like it to be.<br />
<br />
It might not be as bad as you would think. We have to see what happens at Blizzcon, what incentives are given to sub/remain subbed (AP), how the excitement affects sub numbers, etc. If nothing too exciting happens (which is doubtful) might see a good decrease (10%?), if the next xpac is too far out, maybe a bit more. If the next xpac is sooner than some assume, if the content is really grabbing, there is possibility of a sub increase, as some want to come back and readjust to the game before it hits.</div></div><hr />

They won't give us that information. I'm sure those numbers leaking would be catastrophic for Blizzard PR.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't broken. The game isn't old. There is no reason for people to leave. Only thing is, the current market is not suitable for massive subscribtion based games. Too much choice, too many different tastes to satisfy. And most of all: less and less people actually using/owning a PC in this tablet/smartphone infested world.</div></div><hr />

Your proof? Oh wait, you don't have any. <br />
<br />
I don't think that WoW is in any quality state right now and that those numbers are padded by a few factors, but I also don't agree with your opinion that there are only 2 million playing customers.<br />
<br />
Those few padded reasons you ask? 5.4 was about a week before the end of Q3. That means that people that resubscribed to see the 5.4 content were counted, even if they currently have nothing to do with WoW. Additionally, they sent out free weeks of play time around the end of the month that must have been used or lost. Those are technically active accounts, and therefore were counted as &quot;Active subscribers.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
This game is almost 10 years old, and has a good 20 years left. Time to give it up unless you really want to jump up and down in 2034 when it does finally die. <br />
<br />
30 years is a long time to hate dude.<br />
<br />
Dear Fanboys, Worshippers, Fanatics, Apologista, ad nauseaum, and so on infinitum, et cetera,<br />
<br />
Why do you always assume that the only valid positions are: &quot;I love Blizzard and WoW because they are perfect and the best evar!&quot; and &quot;I hate WoW and Blizzard forever and want them to fail!&quot;? <br />
<br />
Personally, I hope this means that whosoever is in charge of future WoW development realizes that there were some solid improvements in MoP's world design and gameplay over Cata and Wrath, and doesn't throw the baby out with the bathwater simply because of subs lost during MoP. Cheers! ;)</div></div><hr />

I still pay for the game ofc, and i still enjoy it and every-single-day i go check for news on MMO champion wich just proves i still have interest in the game. I'm also very very excited about blizzcon and i've already payed for the stream and told wife to leave me alone in the weekend, wich i guess further proves i still love this game.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do believe that blizzard only needs to do something realy cool on the next expansion and subs will recover. Something strong lore-wise that many fans will like to play into.<br />
<br />
The game is now casual friendly, has many end-game options with LFR, flex, normal, Heroic, casual PVP, ranked pvp, arenas, you name it. I just think it needs a little bit of going back to the roots in therms of strong lore (MOP was a flop for me, i just didnt feel the whole panda/eastern vibe apeal to me at all), new character models, some gameplay changes for some classes (rogues fighting in stealth mode, warlocks tanking spec, hunter spec witout pets like a marksman, Hunters dual wielding, etc). <br />
<br />
<br />
Some wild creativity while keeping up with the Lore roots of warcraft 3 is all that it takes to bring people back. The mechanics are there, just needs creativity and lore back.</div></div><hr />

It's Blizzard's fault the community died. They've made the game completely anti-social. Nobody participates in the community anymore because they don't have to.<br />
<br />
WoW is a primarily single player game now and you can play multiplayer if you want to, and most people chose not to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly I've seen this happen a lot to players who quit in Vanilla/BC and come back in Wrath or later. One thing I've noticed a lot is there are players who played very simple dps classes and had a lot of fun with that, and now all the dps specs have such (relatively) higher skill caps it pushes them away. I had a friend who played a mage in vanilla and BC, did fire and frost at different times, tried to come back to playing a mage and got extremely frustrated with how much harder it was. <br />
<br />
I had kept playing my mage through Wrath so it wasn't as different to me, but I completely felt for him. I remember back to playing Arcane/Frost in BC and how ridiculously easy it was:<br />
Pop CDs when available, spam arcane blast for burst, otherwise spam frostbolt.<br />
THAT WAS IT!!!! That was the whole rotation, you could do excellent dps with that. <br />
I remember hunters with one button rotations from cast-sequence macros.<br />
<br />
Comparatively, classes are much tougher now for players who enjoyed that type of gameplay. And sure, you can play the class more simply, but a fire mage who, for example, only spammed fireball and used hot streak on proc would do absolute shit damage. No one would take them seriously or bring them to anything.<br />
<br />
Anyway, what I'm getting at I guess is, I wonder if they changed some of the specs for classes to have much lower skill caps if they'd get more traction from some of the players who come back from playing only in Vanilla and BC.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />

I have little doubt they will come up with some new annual pass type of ploy they'll reveal at Blizzcon to artificially float subs in Q4 too. If they don't, I wouldn't be surprised to see another 1 to 1.5 millon in losses. Simply put, this expansion is in a year long lame duck period and their isn't much compelling reason to play it anymore due to Blizzard front loading all the content into this year in a desperate attempt to stem sub losses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what it said on the box of the original World of Warcraft I purchased back in January 2007. It was one week before the launch of The Burning Crusade expansion.<br />
<br />
7.7 million subs now. After 6 years. Even after they systematically gutted everything that made this game great to make it appeal to a broader audience. Even after turning it into an extremely accessible, all-you-can-eat buffet of MMOs where everyone wins and there is no 2nd place.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong. 7.7 million is nothing to scuff at and any MMO developer today would give their only child to have that many subs. But, you'd think with all the changes to be more user friendly, WoW would be in a better place than it was back when it was considered a 2nd job by many and if you weren't a raider or a PvPer, you were leveling. Can't blame it on daily quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what it said on the box of the original World of Warcraft I purchased back in January 2007. It was one week before the launch of The Burning Crusade expansion.<br />
<br />
7.7 million subs now. After 6 years. Even after they systematically gutted everything that made this game great to make it appeal to a broader audience. Even after turning it into an extremely accessible, all-you-can-eat buffet of MMOs where everyone wins and there is no 2nd place.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong. 7.7 million is nothing to scuff at and any MMO developer today would give their only child to have that many subs. But, you'd think with all the changes to be more user friendly, WoW would be in a better place than it was back when it was considered a 2nd job by many and if you weren't a raider or a PvPer, you were leveling. Can't blame it on daily quests.<br />
<br />
Well, I know a lot of people would like to point out that casuals are far more fickle subscribers than hardcore &quot;no-lifers&quot; and perhaps that's why they're pretty much where they were before the first expansion. And to a certain extent that may be true, 10 casual subscribers who play for 6 months each is only worth 1 dedicated subscriber who plays for 5 years.<br />
<br />
But my question to you is this: <br />
A. How long have you been playing?<br />
B. In that time, how many of your friends have quit the game?<br />
and<br />
C. How many of those friends, HONESTLY, cited the classic &quot;WoW got worse&quot; reasons when they left?<br />
<br />
It may just be me, maybe I'm the exception and not the rule, but I've been playing since Vanilla and in the company of &quot;hardcore&quot; players pretty much that whole time. I've seen hundreds of them quit, hundreds. And you know what was never the cause, not once? Anything related to &quot;Blizz changed X&quot;. Not one cited a shift in the game's design that drove them away. The REAL reasons people quit, always tended to be one (or a combo) of these three things:<br />
A. Real life got too busy<br />
B. My friends don't play anymore<br />
C. I'm just bored<br />
<br />
So, the fact is, even if they changed NOTHING about the game's model, and just kept things going in the same direction, those hardcore players still would have left over time, except they wouldn't have any casual players to replace them.<br />
<br />
Whether Blizz made the right call or not, I cannot say, but one thing I know for sure is that no matter what model they take or what types of players they bring in, people will quit the game. They can only hope to bring in new players to make up for the attrition that they have, and frankly that's what they need to focus on more than &quot;choosing to cater to a certain group of people so they are happy and keep playing&quot;.</div></div><hr />

from a bussiness standpoint 5.6 million people paying to not play actually makes them more money in the long run because they dont have to pay energy costs for the extra server input so good for blizzard i guess?</div></div><hr />

People seem to have been expecting subscription numbers to constantly rise or stay level for 9 years ON THE SAME GAME. WoW has survived 2 generations of consoles and has competed with every PC game on the market. In the end, unless blizzard remake, WoW doesn't have much of a chance. It's still crazy that the game has managed to survive for so long with the amount of competition and development that has gone into PC gaming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, I'm glad to see such a small drop means the community is in a pretty good shape. Considering this includes 5.4 though, we'll have to see how they do the next quarter or two with no new major raid patches coming out, aren't the largest drops inbetween last major patch of expansion and new expansion</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sort of expecting to hear changes to Blizzard's subscription/expansion system at BlizzCon. For instance, instead of selling an expansion every 2 years or so, they can sell &quot;content patches&quot; in smaller, bite-sized chunks.<br />
<br />
Everyone will see mechanics/systems changes to the game, but landmasses/raids/etc. may end up as DLC. Imagine if, at MoP launch, you could've chosen to purchase MSV, HoF, and ToES (or not). Purchase the Operation: Shieldwall pack. The Isle of Thunder (and ToT) pack. And the Siege of Orgrimmar pack.<br />
<br />
Then, when kids save their parents' credit card info for buying content packs, they can also buy the pets/mounts/etc. and Blizzard will make a few more bucks.<br />
<br />
That sounds absolutely awful. Blizzard would lose FAR more than it would gain by implementing a weird system like that. I know I and the group I play with would be gone at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a great result, until you consider the fact that the quickest content release in the game's history, as well as a new patch with another glut of new types of content, couldn't stop the game from losing yet more players. By my count, they're dropping over a thousand players a day on average, with the end of expansion lull to be accounted for in the next earnings call. It would appear that the decline is terminal.<br />
<br />
We're not talking about bad news, but we're certainly not talking about good news.<br />
<br />

you're assuming that A there wont be a patch 5.5 and B the next expansion wont be out alot sooner then mists was. <br />
<br />
when we already know that there will be another patch this expansion with a big pre event we just dont know whether it will be called 5.5 or 6.0 and we already know that unlike the past 2 expansions when it was mostly talk that they have infact more than doubled their team and plan to increase it even more.<br />

you're also comparing dragon soul to siege which is alot smaller than siege is and thus holds interest for a much shorter time.<br />

No more content for another year = cataclysm, except this time it will be cataclysm for Blizzard.<br />

They have done a truly shocking job with Pvp, warrior/melee dominating pvp and they do not give a crap about pvp balance. They also blatantly ignore arena and expect everyone to love and accept rated bgs as the be all and end all of PVP. <br />

<br />
when we already know that there will be another patch this expansion with a big pre event we just dont know whether it will be called 5.5 or 6.0 and we already know that unlike the past 2 expansions when it was mostly talk that they have infact more than doubled their team and plan to increase it even more.<br />
<br />
you're also comparing dragon soul to siege which is alot smaller than siege is and thus holds interest for a much shorter time.<br />
<br />
PPL have killed the last boss in Siege now in LFR. Doesn't matter if its 2 bosses or 20. It gets boring at same rate. <br />
<br />
In terms of new content before next expansion... It will never retain subs against Heartstone open beta launch. There will be at least 1 if not 2 quarters of huge losses in subs for WOW. BLizzard will try to stem the flow with their new recruit a friend system - where each currently playing Subscriber is directly offered incentive to buy 2-5 new copies to gain rewards. The thing is... that's just delaying the loss... And most players with half a brain can see these tactics and realise how desperate BLizzard really are at this point when it comes to WOW.<br />
<br />
The only hope tho... Is that they are actually SO desperate that they might actually work on the game...</div></div><hr />

Wrong. Good 5 man content would do more at this stage IMO. But they need at least 2 or 3 of them in 5.5 if they are gonna keep their head above the 7 million mark.</div></div><hr />

i think you are overestimating the amount of wow players who are into card games. <br />
<br />
hearthstones a good game, and its popular, but it isnt THAT popular, not to mention its not the type of game you play tons of like an mmo. <br />

People seem to have been expecting subscription numbers to constantly rise or stay level for 9 years ON THE SAME GAME. WoW has survived 2 generations of consoles and has competed with every PC game on the market. In the end, unless blizzard remake, WoW doesn't have much of a chance. It's still crazy that the game has managed to survive for so long with the amount of competition and development that has gone into PC gaming.<br />
Shush with your sense-talking.<br />

If this was a bank account, and your monthly statement was always less than the previous month, would you actually be saying: &quot;Ohhh its okay I still have more money than that guy next to me so its all good bro I'm FINE with losing money k?&quot;<br />
<br />
Just a mind-boggling mentality...makes me wonder what some of you people do all day besides playing WoW. I can't imagine you'd even be bright enough to land a job at Burger King.<br />
<br />
No, the mind-boggling mentality is the ammount of people hanging around these forums and day after day they speak of nothing else but how WoW is dying or declining...<br />
<br />
My fun in the game is in no way affected by this &quot;loss&quot;, blizzard is still making way more than the game costs to maintain or even develop in terms of expansions, and frankly...<br />
<br />
What kind of morbid obsession is all this? Yes a 10 year old game is loosing subs and general interest, well of course it is... It's 10 years old, most of the die hard fans are probably family guys and gals at this point, I've played since the launch and as long as I feel the expansions to be interesting I will keep coming back, if nothing else to atleast go through the content once or twice.<br />
<br />
I will admit, other games provide me with far more entertainment than WoW, but I still sit here every time blizzcon rolls by, giggling like a fucking schoolgirl over the next expansion, and I always get the digital deluxe edition.<br />
<br />
This is despite me feeling that the game is WAY to easy atm, anything besides heroic raiding is just a joke, and it makes it boring to play outside of raid nights :P<br />
<br />
But yeah, back to the point, the mind boggling attitude is you and so many others that seem hell bent on trying to rush WoWs demise, it's not a bank account or a stock exchange, it's a freaking game, and 7.6 million players is still a damn massive ammount, and it won't go anywhere untill it maybe hit's the numbers of other MMOs, that is 1-2 million subs, then we might see some form of F2P elements, or talks about a next gen MMO.<br />
<br />
I mean we're at the 5th expansion.... EQ has had 20 so far, and as far as I know, that game is still being played to this day, despite being horribly dated.<br />
<br />
Money isn't everything, nor is other players... I'm having fun, I've had fun for 10 years, I couldn't care less how many quit, hell for all I care they could double the sub fee if they needed, I'd still pay and I'd still get more hours of entertainment worth for that money than any other game out there atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hearthstone and WoW, despite sharing the same branding are not competing goods or services with each other. I would actually consider them to be more of complementary products. Increased interest in one will have some impact on the interest of the other. I can't say this definitively of course or cite and produce numbers since I do not have access to Blizzard's marketing information but it is what I would expect. <br />
<br />
And to those saying diablo doesn't have 'patches' you clearly have not played any of the previous games in the franchise.</div></div><hr />

And well, it still didn't go up; I don't know why people are excited about this. Going down a little at a time when it probably should've gone up isn't good. That said, while I do think consistently losing subscriptions is indicative that the game isn't at its best, I'm not one of these people who say the game is dead if it doesn't have ten million players either, so whatever.</div></div><hr />

It clearly affects you more than you want to admit because you just wrote an essay about it. The game clearly has you so emotionally attached that you have to write a book report on it to defend it. I really could care less but however the numbers indicate nothing but negative.<br />

I dont get it though. On Kazzak-EU there is still a que to log in most evenings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well part of the reason is what you wrote right there. Paying 13EUR/month and waiting in queue every day of the week since about 2 months and exactly nothing is done to remedy the problem, let's not mention that for Kazzak specifically, the realm was unlocked until one week ago, so people could still transfer to it, yet the queues were already in the thousands two months ago - shows me that they really don't care about customer satisfaction, or that they are indeed bunch of amateurs who can't lock a realm when the first sign of queues pop up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The news that they are losing even more players is of course damaging to Wow and no doubt that they are behind the scenes discussing ways to revitalize Wow and inject new players into the mix. <br />

Wow will eventually decline in players, but it should not be at the current rate that they are losing players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think it's just because of the loss rate bottoming out, or because of changes to the game?<br />
<br />
The real answer isn´t about what they fixed this time. It is more ´what happened last December to cause all those losses´ The fact is that Blizzard never lost that many $15 per month players, what they lost were a lot of very low-paying cyber cafe players in China who switched over to a very high-quality free2play game that was released for Chinese cyber cafe´s last December.<br />
<br />
Numbers aren´t stabilizing now because of anything Blizzard did, it is just that everyone who left to play that other game, has already left.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has lost like 40% of its ´players´ since it´s peak, yet it´s revenues have not dropped barely at all. Obviously those 40% were not $15 per month people.</div></div><hr />

If it's 2m playing, I'd be surprised... most of the subs are just people that still pay for sentimental reasons as it's hard to cut the cord from something you once loved!<br />
<br />
Does that matter? If there was 100,000 people paying but 5m paying Blizzard would still release expansion packs and content and claim the game is still in good shape and it would be, WoW is a business and those paying is all the matters in the end</div></div><hr />

You can play EVE for free using ingame currency. <br />

I'm pretty sure that's the case and most likely Blizzard sees it that way ...they compliment one another and, as an example, in my case it did work ...i took a time off of WoW and while at it, i got a beta key for Hearthstone ...after playing it i felt nostalgic to go play my characters in WoW again and after a couple weeks i re-subbed.<br />

A loss of 100k subscribers is much better than what i expected ...last patch didn't have so much great stuff to make us all come back as some other poster noted as most stuff was targeted at those already at end-game content ...i believe game will go well below 7M before expansion and then back to 8M once WoD hits (hate the name still but should start getting used to it).</div></div><hr />

Shrug. Can we all go back to not obsessing about meaningless figures like sub numbers for at least a few months now?<br />

WoW: Still losing more subs than most MMO's gain.<br />
<br />
If that were true it'd be kind of a sad statement about the scale of other MMOs. Fortunately it isn't.</div></div><hr />

TBC at release was 8.5 million and WotLK was 11.5 million at release - BEFORE they opened it to the eastern markets like China. WoW is in a bad spot, make no mistake.<br />

Warhammer online is in a bad spot. AOC is in a bad spot. SWTOR is in a bad spot.<br />

<br />
If it's 2m playing, I'd be surprised... most of the subs are just people that still pay for sentimental reasons as it's hard to cut the cord from something you once loved!<br />
<br />
You think 5.6 million people are happy to pay $15 a month for a game they don't play?<br />

Did you ever consider that maybe your personal beef with the game is completely colouring your perception of it?<br />

I think it wouldn't be far off to say that WoW is starting to level out. I can see it staying around where it's at now for quite a few years. If you look at all of the previous drops in the past couple years it is usually way more than this, ballpark 800k a quarter. <br />
<br />
I think it's safe to say that this is going to be the new norm. New xpack in 8 months or so will bring the numbers up substantially only to level out at a little less than they are now. <br />

<br />
The news that they are losing even more players is of course damaging to Wow and no doubt that they are behind the scenes discussing ways to revitalize Wow and inject new players into the mix. <br />
<br />
Wow will eventually decline in players, but it should not be at the current rate that they are losing players.<br />
<br />
People like you who speak as though WoW is Blizzard's only game/source of income are hilarious.<br />
<br />
You make it sound as if the people who stopped playing WoW didn't simply go to another Blizzard title like Starcraft, Hearthstone or Diablo.<br />
<br />
Just because the numbers on one Blizzard game goes down doesn't mean the numbers on another Blizzard game didn't go up.</div></div><hr />

And well, it still didn't go up; I don't know why people are excited about this. Going down a little at a time when it probably should've gone up isn't good. That said, while I do think consistently losing subscriptions is indicative that the game isn't at its best, I'm not one of these people who say the game is dead if it doesn't have ten million players either, so whatever.<br />
<br />
The game has way gone past its best-before-date for it to gain subscribers again. There is nothing you can do but slow it down.</div></div><hr />

If your argument is money matters, then you should take a look at how much money those people have paid, not how many have paid money. And then how much they have paid before.</div></div><hr />

So? Every game gets old.<br />

WoW is 8 years old and completely dominated its genre for pretty much its entire lifespan. That's an unprecedented accomplishment. In that sense at least, it's probably the most successful game in history.<br />

wow is going well in game i agree, pve wise at least, pvp there will always be whines etc<br />
For all of you who say <br />
7.6 million subscribers but how many logged last 7 days, how many do actually pay etc i will tell you what i did . I went to wowprogress at August! and counted fast and roughly, 25man guilds that are doing ToT and10man guilds that do too. If you consider 25man guilds are from 35-45ppl = 40avg and 10 man is about max 12-15, i calculated, really roughly and found about 2.5million raiders!. I did htat some weeks ago, you are all free to check it. Now wow progress, i don't think it updates automatically, it is updated from guild leaders , so i assume we are like 3.5million raiders atm.<br />
Add about 50% of this population as players who don't raid past flex or are socials, we kinda reach 5million<br />
That's a good amount of active players i think. i wouldnt be surprised if instead of 5 there are 6 or more ...<br />
Future of WoW, i don't think we will see huge decline on subscriptions before next expansion. There are nice interesting things inside wow the last year, i would have to admit that MoP has surpassed TBC from my point of view, the things and the fun stuff you can do are way way many .<br />
Log term future of wow. What saddens me is that blizzard will have to slowly kill and give a dishonorable death to WoW at some point in order to hail the new king (whoever that will be). Players are too accustomed to wow interface and feel like. It is really hard to reboot players in a new game, unless you make the old game decline slowly and deteriorate on content..</div></div><hr />

The game still is following the typical life cycle of a product, so yes, its age is relevant.<br />
<br />
Major difference between WoW and other games is the scale of success. By all accounts WoW was, still is, and will remain a massive success for years to come as long as they keep the sub losses at these levels.<br />
<br />
Also, I am not going to dispute the game being fun. While I haven't played anything during MoP, it has had more to do with time and money rather than the quality of the content. Frankly, I have been quite impressed by some of the stuff Blizzard released this expansion, and I hope they keep that up in the next one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a disturbing amount of people on a WoW fansite who are positive they are talking about a game that doesn't exist anymore...<br />
<br />
Now, one thing I will grant them, is that they are right that the constant loss of subscribers does not bode well. But, for the record, in a competitive business, you definitely DO look at the people around you to judge where you are. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has a game that has just reached 10 years old, and it still has over twice as many subscribers as it did when it first came out of beta. Please, PLEASE, find me one other major MMO that can say that? WoW is still the most successful MMO in history, but it will eventually die. <br />
<br />
No, it hasn't died yet. If you have an opinion about the state of the game that makes you feel it is dead, you'd be wrong. Most likely stupid as well, but wrong at the very least. 7 million subscribers in a market where your next closest competitor only has ~1.5 million is extremely successful. It's borderline monopolistic in fact. Now, it's not AS successful as when they had 10+ million, but just keep that in mind. WoW isn't dead, it isn't failing, it is just less successful than it used to be. <br />
<br />
Now, since I'm sure it'll be said I'm just a fanboy, I'd like to clarify that I actually do think WoW WILL die, but saying WoW is dead or even dying before it is sub 3 million subscribers is pure foolishness. They had a huge surge of growth, they're in decline now, but they're still over the size of the initial subscriber base. Most MMOs peak within a few months of being released and start declining and then dying after that, WoW is one of the few exceptions where they peaked 6 YEARS after being released, and now are still, 4 years later, in decline. If you climb higher, you fall farther, but you're not dead until you hit the ground.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a good effort to be sure, there's some things that skew the numbers greatly that you're not counting on though.<br />
<br />
First, if a guild falls apart they're still counted<br />
Second, people raid on alts<br />
Third, some guilds have multiple raid groups<br />
Fourth is just an estimate BUT, <br />
Average number of players for a 25 man is probably closer to 30-34, 10 man is more like 10-13.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I imagine quite a few people posting aren't still playing. I know I'm not. Left in 5.3, came back for 7 free days in 5.4, in those 7 days I managed to gear up like 5 or 6 chars 2 of which I ran through the first 2 wings of SoO. Timeless isle was fun for about the first 2 hours. I managed to gear up most of those alts just doing timeless isle on my 2 &quot;mains&quot; so I didn't actually even need to play them. I did enjoy those 7 days, but at the end of it I didn't really see enough in there that would keep me busy having fun for a whole month.<br />
<br />
That said, I'm glad they are finally starting to level off, hopefully it continues, but the period from now until next xpack hit could be rough depending on how far out it is. Either way slowing down that decline is good for the health of the game, and they can't make new content and improve things if they aren't making money. I hope it sticks and hope the next expansion is great and I can get back into WoW and sink my teeth into some meaty content.</div></div><hr />

IDK man I actually enjoy some aspects of the Timeless Isle: <br />
<br />
1. Easy to get gear for my alts. This really opens the entire expansion to alts for me for the very first time since 5.0. It's a big deal. I really, really hated the &quot;VP gear is gated on 13 different reps you have to grind per character&quot;. Cutting the rep in half was better but not enough for me to play an alt. No more - now I have the opportunity to get my alts into TOT and SoO LFR. Mind you, I'd have been content to farm VP on each of them in 5 man heroics, but since that's such a _terrible_ thing somehow that I'm not allowed to enjoy this expansion, Timeless Isle will have to suffice. <br />
<br />
2. Got a piece I needed to help out my gear until I could replace it. <br />
<br />
3. Show up once a week to get a chance to get decent gear. My Tier 16 legs came from there.</div></div><hr />

For endgame current expansion is pretty great, but a lot of end-game players been playing wow so long that they are bored no matter what blizzard throws at them.<br />
So yes, they should really focus on the new players and make sure the leveling experience is interesting and not to fast.</div></div><hr />

It's subscriptions not players or subscribers. There a quite a few multi boxers that have 30+ active accounts. So the number of players is quite less. Glad to clear that up for you. :D</div></div><hr />

If it's 2m playing, I'd be surprised... most of the subs are just people that still pay for sentimental reasons as it's hard to cut the cord from something you once loved!<br />

Proof? Any proof at all? Anything? Anything even tangible?</div></div><hr />

Thats the population of a large city and their nearest rival (use that term lightly) has a little less than 2 million people playing. They really do need to turn around the game a bit though.</div></div><hr />

New players will level a lot faster then they are learning their new game &amp; character. The slower pace was a lot better for first time players. <br />

Personally I was extremely disappointed in the amount of leveling content provided in Cat, and it took me half as long to level in MoP. The number of actual enjoyable activities you can participate at endgame are fairly limited, while the number of repetitious activities you have to participate into to stay current is fairly high. Leveling has been so sped up at this point, all the fun has been sucked out of it and it is just a boring blur of activities to get you to max. I may be a minority but I actually enjoyed it when the journey was long, it made the world feel larger, it made it feel like an actual accomplishment, it took time and in the time I would get attached to the character. Now I can level a new alt in no time at all and have a full set of timeless isle gear waiting for them, all without having barely played them.</div></div><hr />

Even Asia, after a bit of research (google) i found some data about many other MMOs including Asia-only ones and WoW is still king with more than three times the amount of active players for even the second place (Aion).<br />
<br />
This includes those fancy and shiny famous MMOs like Rift and SWTOR which don't even make it past 1M.<br />
<br />
WoW is in a declining state, that's for sure, but it still will be long until some other takes the first place and, to my opinion, numbers will stabilize between 4M - 5M active players until Blizzard decides to shut it down and, even without new expansions, that will surely take it's good years.<br />
<br />
WoW is a behemoth without a doubt, an unstoppable force that's just losing some of its motion.</div></div><hr />

If you are going to compare with Asia using Western subscription games you are doing it wrong. There are games in Asia that are only available in Asia that have peaks close to 3 million concurrent users. That is likely close to the number of subscribers of WoW in Asia after all the losses we haves seen, except those are concurrent users and usually the number of concurrent users at peak is much smaller than the actual number of users. My guess would be anywhere between 5x-10x that number would be the active user count.</div></div><hr />

You are completely clueless. By the way it is significantly more than 1,000 losses a day. At the end of the day they are just as many people joining as there are leaving.<br />
<br />
A 1.3% drop is insignificant. It is nothing.<br />
<br />
There are 7.6 million subscribers. 100k is only 1.3%. It is NOTHING.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW will die..... some day. But not yet.<br />
<br />
And from the perspective of someone who did actually quit for about 6 months this expac and came back for 5.4, it's improved in the latter part of the expansion. And I'm not talking about timeless isle. Sure, the island was nice for gearing up alts, but my 2 mains are what I care about most. And Flex made it possible for me to not really worry about guild drama, or schedules, etc. I've had more fun raiding flex that I ever did when I was in a hardmode guild in Cata. I raid on my terms and I enjoy myself. I also spend many less hours wiping on end for the bragging rights that I never gave a crap about anyway.<br />
<br />
I look very forward to seeing what they announce at Blizzcon. Because right now I feel like they're moving things in a good direction for a changing playerbase. We aren't all teenagers able to blow off real life anymore. We've got jobs, kids, responsibilities. But nothing says we can't still get on and slay some dragons. The time to get that done is just reduced. And offering me the ability to get that done in a form such as flex where I have some actual say so on who I do that with unlike LFR is a HUGE improvement that I think will be a major contributor to keeping the game around even longer.</div></div><hr />

And when the new expansion comes out next year, we’ll see a spike of 1.5 - 2million again and lose another 2 million at the end of the expansion. The cycle repeats.</div></div><hr />

I got my data from http://mmodata.net/<br />
<br />
However their numbers for PCU(peak concurrent users) are pretty old, but I can't imagine they would be significantly lower now vs. 3 years ago, although the games in question have likely changed.</div></div><hr />
