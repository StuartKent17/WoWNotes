Totally agree and I thought they made new expac launches so much more interesting. I even remember standing in line outside a Gamestop or whatever it was back then to buy Wrath and talking to some guy at midnight who was going to race home and try to get realm first fishing. Love that things like this are returning. WooOOT</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, Demonic is already nice in M+ imo (never done very high keys though) thanks to his high uptime on metamorphosis (100% leech + dps), insane cleave, great control (stun + racial silence if Horde).<br />
Now with bloodlust on nearly every pack with T21 ? I take it !</div></div><hr />

<br />
With this, BrM is going to be unhittable on single target. Sure it doesn't reduce damage from boss abilities, but taking literally no melee hits will make sure you are always at 100% with empty stagger when a big hit comes. So that these will also never kill you. This bonus would be way too strong if it went live like this.</div></div><hr />

When 7.3 PTR was flagged as Release, it was Live one week after.<br />

Yeah, I honestly expect Antorus to come out on the 31st this month. During the Holloween Week, but before Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
The PERFECT time to release the most hellish of Raids.</div></div><hr />

Hard to tell honestly. They could make release build earlier, because next 3 weeks they will be busy with 8.0 annoucement and demo for Blizzcon. After Blizzcon they can release patch on live servers and focus on Antorus launch and tuning.<br />
<br />
I expect Antorus few weeks after Blizzcon, 7.3.5 PTR late November (but I'm not sure on this, 7.3.5 could be something in the middle of content drought) and 8.0 Alpha week-two after Christmas break.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it's hard to tell.<br />

Another possibility :<br />
<br />
7.3.2 may be live on Mar 24th October<br />
(why ? Because it's one week after his PTR was flagged as Released, as i said above)<br />
<br />
Antorus may open on Mar 31st October<br />
(why ? Because a raid never open the day of a patch, but one week after)<br />
<br />
7.3.5 may be live on Mar 14th November<br />
(why ? Because Blizzard said there will be another patch quickly after Antorus release for class tunning. Another reason, this date is the 77th day after the release of 7.3.0 on Mar 29th August)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure.. release a raid BEFORE Blizzcon and screw the world first race.<br />
<br />
Not going to happen. there will also be a pvp season end announcement 2 weeks prior.<br />
<br />
November 14 is the 77 days mark if that still holds, because from what we know, there is no pattern that is consistant in Blizzard's patch releases.<br />
<br />
Other possible date is December 5th, when AK55 is obtainable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, let's be honest.<br />
<br />
If they release Antorus BEFORE Blizzcon, then people will know about the Next Expansion more, and be prepared for that. <br />
<br />
However...<br />
<br />
If they release Antorus AFTER Blizzcon, then it'll feel like a last second move before the Expansion goes on Alpha stages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you talking about? Dodge DR affects the conversion rate of Dodge stat into dodge chance. The mastery stacks are just additive. Go and try it in game, if you have enough stacks to hit 100% dodge, you always dodge. No DR involved anywhere. <br />
<br />
Also keqe in the Brewmaster thread has already shown video of how this 4p gives you permanent dodge against one target.<br />
<br />
I don't like this tier bonus either, because it will lead to the most degenerate gameplay. It is overpowered and dumb. Doesn't change that on single target it would be a great survivability bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That gif only shows that it's going to ruin the entire BrM rotation which will also ruin the rate at which brews are gained. That'll just lead up to monks not having enough IB duration or any stored charges for PB. <br />
<br />
Who cares if you can dodge the bosses autoattacks if you won't be able to manage the actual hits that are coming in. 100% that it's getting nerfed before the raid even comes out like T20 did</div></div><hr />

Plus you can use kegsmash still. Also there is the wrist legendary. The bonus is still (in the form it exists right now) the strongest tank tier bonus. I personally just hope they scrap it.</div></div><hr />
