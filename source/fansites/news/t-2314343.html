Whether you’re joining us for BlizzCon® in person or online, get ready for an epic finale—Muse is coming to BlizzCon 2017! Blizzard Entertainment today announced that the Grammy Award–winning band will close out the 11th BlizzCon on Saturday, November 4, delivering a stage-shattering conclusion to Blizzard’s two-day community celebration for everyone attending in person and joining from home with the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket.<br />
<br />
Widely renowned as one of the best live acts in the world, Muse—Matt Bellamy, Dominic Howard, and Chris Wolstenholme—have won numerous music awards, including two Grammy Awards, an American Music Award, five MTV Europe Music Awards, two Brit Awards, six NME Awards, and six Q Awards. Since forming in 1994, Muse have released seven studio albums, selling more than 20 million copies worldwide. Their latest album, Drones, debuted at #1 in 21 countries around the world and scored the band their first #1 album in the United States—along with an award for Best Rock Album at the 2016 Grammy Awards.<br />
<br />
Returning to Anaheim, California for its 11th year, BlizzCon is a massive celebration of Blizzard’s universes and the global player communities that bring them to life. The event has drawn thousands of Blizzard gamers from all over the world to the Anaheim Convention Center for more than a decade, with millions more tuning in online. This year’s show, running November 3 and 4, will be loaded with in-depth developer panels, thrilling esports tournaments, community contests, and much more.<br />
<br />
“We’re thrilled to close out our 11th BlizzCon with a performance from one of rock’s greatest live acts,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “Muse has wowed millions of people around the world with their groundbreaking music, and we’re excited that they’re coming to give BlizzCon attendees an epic sendoff.”<br />
<br />
This year’s Virtual Ticket brings the Blizzard community viewing from home even closer to BlizzCon with expanded stage coverage, a new BlizzCon All Access channel, on-demand videos, and several series of weekly preshow videos—available to watch now on www.blizzcon.com. It also comes with a cache of commemorative in-game goodies for a variety of Blizzard games, including World of Warcraft®, Overwatch®, Hearthstone®, Diablo® III, StarCraft® II, and Heroes of the Storm®.<br />

Nothing wrong with Muse. At least it isn't rap, or pop music.</div></div><hr />

They should aim for more geeky bands, or just have an orchestra play their soundtracks, which are excellent.</div></div><hr />

Well to be fair they have been in video games. Guitar hero and the like has used their music before. Not everyone wants to see VGL all the time either.</div></div><hr />

However, I do wonder how Muse being the band will fuel the future expansion speculation (2013 had Blink-182 playing a song about time (WoD), and 2015 had Linkin Park, an angsty band for an angsty new class).</div></div><hr />

Completely objectively, yes, you can't really argue that they're not. Subjectively, who cares? Though personally, again I think yes. <br />

I don't understand why it's not a staple thing for blizzcon instead of getting random bands every year. Even ETC would be more fitting imo.<br />

That being said Muse is great at live performances and worth to behold even if their music isn't your thing.</div></div><hr />

ITT - &quot;Blizzard you should have got this obscure Lithuanian power metal band that me an my brother formed 25 minutes ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
NOW you're talking. Get Meshugga up there. I want Blizzcon attendees running from the hall with their fingers in their ears, tears in their eyes, screaming &quot;Make it stop!&quot; Since Motorhead and Gwar are no more (the &quot;new&quot; GWAR ain't GWAR), I want FEAR - book Pigface, or Skinny Puppy, or Prong. Go for the gusto and get Ministry in there. Al would love to terrorize the Blizzcon crowd, and he probably plays WoW. Book Hanzel Und Gretyl and watch the SWJ head's explode. Sepultura is active right now, get them in there to pummel the nerds. <br />
<br />
Hey, I can dream. <br />
<br />
Next year, it's gonna be Nickleback. You know it's true. They only book &quot;safe&quot; bands. Them, or Ariana Grande.<br />

That's what my ex-gf said about Dave Mathews, when she dragged me to his show. I was bored after the first song. I literally fell asleep halfway through. <br />
<br />
If you like Muse, fine, but I find them to be pretty bland, and the singer style of singing makes me want to hit stuff, because it's so annoying and affected. I'm not paying money to sleep through a concert ever again.</div></div><hr />

Why are you posting the tamest bands as if they are the most extreme thing on the planet? How would Meshuggah, Ministry or Sepultura make people &quot;run from the hall with their fingers in their ears, years in their eyes, screaming &quot;make it stop!&quot;? <br />

Those are literally bands that have very small fan bases. When they are selling out places like Wembly Stadium and headlining major festivals in the USA and Europe, then you can bring them up. Until then, Muse is a huge name in music and they are an awesome band live.</div></div><hr />

Drones was a lot fucking better than that shit fest that was 2nd Law.

They use music that fits with flow of the moment, not necessarily with the demographic of the audience. Muse has been used in many things including World War Z all the way to Episodes of Doctor Who, as have many bands. Just because a band was used in a crappy movie doesn't make them less of a band lol.</div></div><hr />

Elite Tauren Chieftains played, and you had the Orchestre there that played music from all three (Warcraft, Starcraft, &amp; Diablo) venues. Blizzard also had the group that did the Tavern Music there too. All three were AWESOME!! I would say don't bother getting modern rock or pop groups, keep it in house with ETC. That's my 2 cents.<br />

Confirms what I suspected - they're much, much, much more well-known and well-liked in the UK than the USA.</div></div><hr />

I agree with some other suggestions about music from the games being played. It's just not the right environment for a rock concert, the audience is completely disengaged aside from a few who really like the band that year. The only &quot;band&quot; they've had that seemed to get an overall good response from the audience was Tenacious D. I'm looking forward to watching the concert but it is a bit on the cringe side to watch a group try to respond to a completely disinterested audience.</div></div><hr />

I'm not so pedantic to judge a show by the clothes the front man is wearing?<br />
I'm glad I'm not with you either.<br />

<br />
Since 2 of the 4 have been gone a while now, and getting the remaining 2 would double the ticket price of Blizzcon...<br />
<br />
Yeah you have to consider they have to pay the band, it's not going to be an act so big that they play arenas because they can gross around a million dollars from one arena show, you're just not going to see Blizzard shell out that kind of money.<br />
<br />
But heck, Muse is definitely an appropriate quality band for the event, way better than Blink182 or whoever they had a while back...<br />

Question to people who have attended Blizzcon in the past and watched the band of the year: what's the sound like? Is it anything like a typical rock concert in terms of quality and volume? It's hard, and kind of sad to imagine Muse being pared down to fit into such a relatively small and meek setting. They're a monstrous live band and I hope Blizzcon's setup can do them justice.<br />
<br />
The main stage is actually pretty big. They have seating for a couple thousand people in that hall, if I am not mistaken. It's not &quot;pared down&quot; at all really. Now, I don't know what the sound system is like, because I have never attended Blizzcon, but I have seen the live stream, and the space is certainly as big a some music halls bands regularly play in many cities.</div></div><hr />

I can say for certain about last year, but all closing ceremonies and bands prior had vods up on VT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry but don't expect &quot;quality&quot; &quot;urban&quot; music like XXXTentacion at Blizzcon sadly.<br />
<br />
Either way, Muse is a stellar band by pretty much any metrics that probably costs an harm and a leg to get on stage, so good on Blizzard there. Might buy the ticket after all.</div></div><hr />

Unless they changed it from the last couple of years. There will be a vod up for a couple of weeks after blizzcon.</div></div><hr />
