Heroic Terrace of Endless Spring Progression Update<br />
Terrace of Endless Spring is close to being cleared, with the first three bosses already down by Blood Legion (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/illidan/Blood+Legion). Vodka (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/alterac-mountains/vodka) is in second place with 2/4 defeated, and Exodus (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/cho-gall/Exodus) is in third place with 1/4.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that the LFR version of Terrace of Endless Spring is now open! You can find guides for all of the bosses on Icy Veins (http://www.icy-veins.com/terrace-of-endless-spring-raid-wow).<br />

<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Patch 5.1<br />
Where is our unique anglers tabard, and where are our other water strider colors? <br />
Anglers tabard is a bug. We'll fix. Not sure we ever intended to make other striders available. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/263072257755209729))<br />
<br />
Questing<br />
Remove class specific quest rewards? When none of the items are an upgrade, I would always chose the one that sells for most <br />
Okay, weapon costs still vary. We made all armor types the same cost. It used to be, you were dumb not to choose the plate one. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262970910032666625))<br />
<br />
World<br />
Isn't the fact that the fans want flying on silvermoon enough justification to do it? Will it ever get done or r u sayin never <br />
Say you were the game director on WoW. Would you spend art time on Silvermoon or a new raid? Not saying there's a right answer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262971103834689536))<br />
<br />
Draenei are the SINGLE most neglected race in the entire game. Even Forest Song didn't get a single upgrade. <br />
I don't know who is the &quot;most neglected&quot; but we have plans for Draenei. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/262733725148798976))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Is it possible to make tab-targeting target the closest enemy in front of you instead of every totem, pet, critter and tree? <br />
Gotten that request a lot lately. We'll look at it. Could also do a mod-tab or something. <br />
<br />
Are the other members of SI:7 in Jade Forest dead? (ie, Amber Kearnen) Loved Amber. <br />
I believe Amber survived.<br />
<br />
Oh and where is my bat mount? Bats have been taxis forever and it's still not a mount. Hook a forsaken up! <br />
We need a better looking bat model, but after that, for sure. <br />
<br />
&quot;We are concerned about how money will we still get from servers transfers&quot; There, i fixed that for you. <br />
Nah. It's better business to have the game endure a long time because players like it than to make a quick buck. <br />
<br />
Can you talk about possible reasons why you would not allow a choice between old and new player models? <br />
We might. That would be a good way to reduce the &quot;looks great but not my guy&quot; factor. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which, what's your opinion on &quot;datamining&quot;? Is it a good thing or just something you're forced to live with? <br />
Probably good overall. I wish players didn't accept it as truth. The miners usually caveat everything pretty well. <br />
<br />
Did you ever expect so many guilds to make optional addons &quot;mandatory&quot; parts of joining/playing the game? <br />
I would not have predicted that players would become so focused on efficiency. Not fun or improving themselves. Efficiency. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261362197857456128))<br />
<br />
Will upgrading gear though valor points be added in 5.1? Or will it be added later? <br />
The plan is 5.1. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261360678206590976))<br />
<br />
Why don't you go with smaller and more consistent patches? It feels like you need to be able to monitor changes btr? <br />
Informed players (like many of you) might prefer that, but for many players it feels like near constant class design churn. <br />
Is there a problem with that honestly? The quicker its tuned, the faster balance approaches, its how it works <br />
Believe it or not, a lot of players quit playing if we're in a state of always tuning classes, even if better balance is achieved. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261361561648656384))<br />
<br />
Is there any chance of the Motes/Spirits of Harmony becoming BoA in the future? <br />
Perhaps in a future patch. We like the way they are playing for now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/261149962644107264))<br />
<br />
What is going on with revamped character models ,having a hard time finding a blue post on forums <br />
We've said we're working on it, but it's a huge task with a lot of risk so it won't be anytime soon. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/260776065977446400))<br />
<br />
How about a search feature for the mount tab similar to non-combat pet tab, purdy please? <br />
Yeah, we'll do one. <br />
<br />
But arthas death is still a bit unresolved, whats up?<br />
Unresolved? Dead as a doornail. (Source (https://twitter.com/ChrisMetzen/status/260421632307372032))<br />
I think what he means by &quot;unresolved&quot; is the whole &quot;where is his body&quot;<br />
I know - I was dodging. (Source (https://twitter.com/ChrisMetzen/status/260425292479332352))<br />
<br />
Can you explain what &quot;High King&quot; really means? Does it mean Varian is above the other leaders, or something else? <br />
Much like the &quot;Warchief&quot; of the Horde, the High King is trying to coordinate the actions of all the races in the Alliance. <br />
<br />
Why can't I put my herbalism spade in my herb bag? My fishing rod goes in my fishing bag.<br />
Great point! It has now been fixed for 5.1! <br />

<br />
Well you need to realize that they are on a WHOLE new level when it comes to raiding. They raid constantly for MANY, MANY hours at a time. They have alts more geared than most people's mains in their main run for raid comp reasons. It's just how they, and many other guilds at that level, are at.</div></div><hr />

It will open after maintenance today, already open in the US.<br />

Wonder if wow progress will take this into account and base it off time since release as if blizz keeps releasing content that can be cleared this fast it kinda of messes up the race a little, its like starting a marathon that isn't as hard as you thought and you get to start two hours before everyone else, its not about EU vs US, it would be nice for the race to be as fair as possible.</div></div><hr />

Just the weekly reset. Weird though that Blood Legion is already at 3/4 hc when EU servers still needed that reset. Giving them that much of a headstart on the last boss means a lot at that level. I realize Method can still clear the first 3 is the same amount of time, but there is no room to catch up to the US because some of those bosses are blocking the road you know?<br />
<br />
@Jakesterwars: I wouldn't call it a whole 'new' level, it's been like that for quite some time now. It's a freaking high level nonetheless ^^</div></div><hr />

I agree. I did it in the US today and rolled right through all the bosses, no one even explained the fights we just went right in. I think it's way too under-tuned (especially compared to the other LFR's)</div></div><hr />

Great that they're fixing it instead of fucking over Alliance players again, but weren't just a couple weeks ago they were defending it as a good decision because it meant the tabard was still obtainable and it connected the neutral Anglers faction to Theramore?</div></div><hr />

Nah. It's better business to have the game endure a long time because players like it than to make a quick buck. <br />

And still they do nothing.</div></div><hr />

Is it possible to make tab-targeting target the closest enemy in front of you instead of every totem, pet, critter and tree? <br />
Gotten that request a lot lately. We'll look at it. Could also do a mod-tab or something. <br />

They don't seem to realise that there's an option to unkeybind &quot;target nearest enemy&quot; and re-keybind it to &quot;target nearest enemy player&quot; this stops you from tab targeting to totems, critters, pets...</div></div><hr />
