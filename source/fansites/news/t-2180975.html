Removing Secondary Traits from Relics 
In the next PTR build, you’ll see that we’ve replaced the final Order Hall research (which caused relics to gain a second trait at random) with one that grants a chance for Artifact Power rewards from World Quests to be doubled.

Removing Secondary Traits from Relics<br />
In the next PTR build, you’ll see that we’ve replaced the final Order Hall research (which caused relics to gain a second trait at random) with one that grants a chance for Artifact Power rewards from World Quests to be doubled.<br />
<br />
We’re doing this for a few reasons, the largest of which being that we simply weren’t satisfied with the current state of the system. There were several rough edges, including a few which were pointed out by your feedback. While these issues could be solved, we weren’t confident we could do so in a way that meets our standards in time for 7.2, so we’d rather shelve the idea for now.<br />
<br />
That said, we definitely feel that there’s more that can be done with relics, and are discussing some possible ideas for a future Legion update. We don’t have anything to share just yet, but it’s something we’re thinking about. Thanks again for all the feedback on this topic!<br />
<br />

PTR Build Deploy 3/7/2017<br />
Greetings all,<br />
We'll be bringing down the PTR realms in order to deploy a new 7.2.0 build. No ETA for today's push but I'll ping this thread if things look like they're going to take longer than usual (4-6 hours). <br />
<br />
As always, I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
Druid Class Mount Issues<br />
Quick heads up about a change you'll be seeing in the next build.<br />
<br />
We've found a few issues, and we're going to need to temporarily remove the Archdruid's Lunarwing Form from the mount journal. The option to change the look of your flight form will be available as an NPC in your class hall, operating similarly to the Glyph of the Sentinel.<br />
<br />
We're working on getting a solution to you as soon as we can, apologies and thanks!<br />
<br />
Also, since we're here, if you prefer it this way, please let us know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's kind of a double edged sword. You're either excited you got a crap relic that has a good secondary or pissed you got a good relic with a crap secondary. <br />
<br />
The endgame for them would be hunting the bis relics still with the best possible secondary, a little too RNG for me.</div></div><hr />

I don't think its replacement is as terrible others are making it out to be, either. Maybe it's not all that great for mains (and I don't like it being a &quot;chance&quot;), but could be useful for alts or those who are late-comers.</div></div><hr />

That would likely depend on the class that you are playing. A few weeks ago I shelf'd my Hunter to raid on the Rogue, and all the guides that I've read point to the best relics still being worth an extra 15 to 20 item levels.<br />
<br />
I was really looking forward to the secondary traits. They might make a comeback with the Argus patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those that don't know, for fire relics for ret paladins, the BiS trait only comes from Shade of Xavius in DHT and Xavius in EN.<br />
<br />
I was really looking forward to the double traits not only as a spike in player power, (which is always fun) but also as a way to have a chance at BiS relics outside of very specific instances.<br />
<br />
It sucks even more that it was replaced with a chance for WQ AP to Titanforge. Removing an actual good system to add more RNG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The double traits actually meant less RNG cancer for a lot of specs. As a ret paladin, all my damage traits are pretty close to each other, except bonus Crusade duration, which is twice as good as other traits. Without this change, I am stuck farming Xavius, Chronomatic Anomaly, DHT and BRH for the rest of the goddamn expansion. With the double traits, any fire/holy relic would at least have a chance of having my BiS trait, instead of being guaranteed vendor trash.</div></div><hr />

Where are you getting 5% from? Blizzard is not THAT greedy, it will probably be more along the lines of 30%-50%.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather see something like 30% to double, 10% to triple, 3% to quadruple...</div></div><hr />

Not really. If you have BIS traits then you focus on it.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard wants the main factor of what's an upgrade or not to be ilvl. So, yes. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if we go back to main stat, stamina, and crit as the lone secondary stat next expansion to achieve this.</div></div><hr />

Did you even read what I wrote?<br />
<br />
You realize the double trait relics could not have two of the same trait, right? For men, any relic with WOTA+something else is automatically BiS, provided the other trait is not zero dps.</div></div><hr />

So the solution is to have an even more grindy RNG-fest because you're tired of running the same instances? How is that good for the game?</div></div><hr />

They had even already confirmed that the secondary trait would always be a damage boosting trait and not one of the utility traits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's good for me because when I run NH I have 6 chances at a BiS relic instead of 1.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
Indeed! Which means a relic that natively has WOTA would be automatic BiS, same as now, and a relic that natively had any other damage trait would have a chance at being BiS.</div></div><hr />

What if I didn't had WOTA but something else + something else.<br />
Still RNG. More random option means more RNG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then it's a relic that I would have vendored anyway before the patch.<br />
<br />
Currently there are 4 relics in the game that are BiS.<br />
<br />
With double traits, those 4 relics would still be BiS no matter what they roll.<br />
<br />
In addition to those 4 relics, there's dozens of others that could roll BiS in the double trait system. I would not be losing anything under this system, only gaining potential upgrades.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wouldn't you rather have a chance with higher base ilvl relics to give you the trait you want than continue to farm old content in the hopes of a titanforging? You'd still be dealing with the same RNG, not an additional layer of RNG</div></div><hr />

I'm not that updated on the double relic system, but was it really going to be &quot;All relic drops in 7.2 has a CHANCE to have a secondary trait rank&quot;? If so, that's just unnecessary and frankly a bit ridiculous. Quite a lot of people have issue adapting to WoW where being 100% optimal is and should be near unattainable.

No, the effect was a guaranteed random additional throughput trait for every relic. It was a good system, can't really see too many issues with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one will max it and believe me, no one will even grind it (maybe, just maybe hardcore will grind for first paragon before ToS launch):<br />
- it is in fact infinite, 50 is just a number, probably mythic+ keystones also have &quot;max' number that no one will ever reach<br />
- numbers are still not finished, but we know it will not be % damage/armor increase, but static number, so geting high titanforge in some slot will probably be much better upgrade than another paragon point<br />
- AP needed for next paragon will be ridiculous<br />
- from experience we will know that paragon points will go away next major patch, so your artifact is &quot;complete&quot; after maxing regular traits.<br />
<br />
No one (sane) grind for max titanforge bis, because all know it is impossible to get it in all slots. Warforge/titanforge removed need for bis in every slot, now the same is happening with artifact weapons.<br />
<br />
Paragon point are just place to dump your AP somewhere, AP encourage us to doing many different activity: WQ, PVP, dungeons. I know that many would like &quot;raid or die&quot; way, but most people like do many different stuff and get reward for that. You know, because they pay for this game monthly. When I log in, I want to have a choice instead of list of things that I must do before reset. Also AP is perfect reward for max level story quests like Suramar and Broken Shore/Argus in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is basically how I'd been doing it since the BIS trait relics never dropped for me. I mean, I cant sneeze at having three Titanforged relics boosting my weapon's ilvl to absurdity.</div></div><hr />

Still RNG. More random option means more RNG.<br />
<br />
Not all RNG is bad, this would have made a raid fire relic possibly BiS for ret which would be much easier to get then spamming DHT or pugging mythic xavius.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amabar</div><div class="date">2017-03-07, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mean, the core of the problem is that it is boring to only have a set place to get relics. If we could swap out relics like gear, then this might make sense; but since it is a replacement mechanic, they are considered consumable.<br />
<br />
Therefore, simply randomize all relic traits. Now, if I know that I could get a fire relic from a boss with a minimum item level close to my current fire relic, then I am excited to possibly get a better trait, or warforge. As it is now, if I don't care about the trait, then it actually feels negative - I know for a fact that I would not use the relic that could drop - no matter the titanforge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Caveat: yes, some classes have very balanced traits that don't really care, but some classes really do care a lot about the difference.</div></div><hr />

Said every raider ever. There is a reason why the AP yield of every boss in The Nighthold was increased recently.</div></div><hr />

On one hand I'm stuck with the same few Relics that give a great trait regardless of higher Ilvl relics dropping. On the other hand, getting a double BiS trait proc on a low ilvl relic would've been groanworthy.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BellicoseAxe</div><div class="date">2017-03-08, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">at the moment you have already enough Ressources for the researches if you played a bit. Till the patch comes out, you also have (if not already) enough AP for all traits.<br />
<br />
On a twink/new char you don't have enough ressources for all the researches and until you have them finaly, you have also already maxed out your weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, what exactly is the point of double AP ?<br />
To keep the world quests relevant. <br />
<br />
Order hall resources are best spent on acquiring your seals of broken fate, so you are spending 7k resources on that each week. You will run out unless you are going out of your way to farm them, even on your main.<br />
<br />
Then you mention alts, but those alts are also gated by their artifact knowledge, their inability to grind out higher Mythic+ level, so on. Besides, you will still be farming AP for a very long time because of the Paragon levels, so you will end up benefiting from the double AP perk regardless.<br />
<br />
As an aside, Nighthold didn't do it for me, so I will continue to enjoy the outdoor content until the Tomb Sargeras is released. My main character's main spec weapon is level 49 and his secondary spec weapons are even further behind, so this new research will benefit my main as much as it will benefit my alts.</div></div><hr />

It was probably changed because some guy there thought &quot;Hmm, perhaps the RNG factor is already too big, let's not make this shit worse...&quot;</div></div><hr />

Specs that are heavy trait constraint (e.g. ret pally) would had more sources of relics, now without the double traits they are stuck with only a subset of bosses that can drop a decent relic for them</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc93208f15ee</div><div class="date">2017-03-08, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im not sure if others have tested yet, but these all new nethershard drop rates are terrible. 5000 for one epic piece and whole greater beacon(elite mobs from portals) that was also time extended resulted in a awesome 12 nethershards.<br />
After 4-5 greater beacons... results were 10-15 nethershards per beacon. Normal beacon with normal mobs resulted in ONE nethershard :)<br />
<br />
Something seems off to me :) I get more just killing random mobs around the zone, they often drop 10 or so themselves.<br />
<br />
Also, relic token gave me 890ilvl one. And apparently those can have raid items too? I remember someone saying that, so if they fix shard drop rates, it might be a decent alternate source of relics.</div></div><hr />
