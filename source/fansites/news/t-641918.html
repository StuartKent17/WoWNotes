Wait, sorry, it's worse. What with having an instance chock-full of hard modes that you're going to have to forgo. (Note: I have Immortal, and I've replicated getting it a few times since the first time, and I still think it's stupid).<br />
<br />
Also, the talent calculator doesn't seem to actually be updated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do bosses 1-6 no deaths, they count. One wipe on boss 7, he won't be achievable for that lockout period. Finish the rest without any deaths, and the achievement is mostly complete : at the next lockout period, you can have wipes on all the bosses, as long as you do boss 7 perfectly you'll get the achievement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, I misread it as a change to the current Immortal system. This is just a tooltip clarification since that's how it was working regardless under the new system.<br />
<br />
Not too bad, then. Still not seeing any talent calculator updates, and they look... well, it looks like the live version, but with buggy tooltips.</div></div><hr />

Again because ppl are complaining that they spend 16k gold to find out it is not a normal mount! Stupid things like 2 sec dismount/mount times, unbuffable cause its a vehicle. They didnt think about the fact it now doesnt take fall dmg anymore, doesnt help vs rogue saps and other cc's.. since those were the only reasons i farmed 4 months for it. G fucking G! Uninformed scrubs control this game in every aspect<br />
<br />
Only reason i keep this profession now is because of the Arrows/Bullets i make, but that will probably become useless as well when Blizzard is gonna introduce non consumable ammo. (unless ENGINEERS ONLY will be able to make and use the best ammo ingame! *hint *hint Blizzard).<br />
<br />
Why cant they just add some better gear improvements for ENGINEERS ONLY!? I mean Rocket Boots!? Parashute Cloak!? Even if it had the exact same stat increase that come with enchanting + the rocket/parashute ability, it will only be just a &quot;funny&quot; thing to have. But i gues thats exactly what they want to make from this profession.<br />

<br />
<br />
Alright, let's see. I just have to respond to this, more of a lurker in general.<br />
<br />
Mount: Everyone can buy it. The helicopter? By now, everybody is swimming in Proto-Drakes, so who cares?<br />
<br />
Repair Bot: What about the Traveler's Mammoth? It has a built-in Repair Bot - mount up, have your raid repair, dismount. And if you wipe in Naxxramas regularly (which you do quite often, I guess, otherwise you wouldn't be here, complaning about Engineering), you can just repair at Venomspite. Please tell me, where do we need repair bots again?<br />
<br />
Rocket Boots Enchant: PvP only, until 3.1 - as soon as the patch hits, it will be great for getting rid of some hit rating. But still, why nerf it? Yes, it's a unique benefit, so what - JC gems or Blacksmithing bonus sockets do not get their effect cut in half, because a Jewelcrafter has a few hundred more HP or a bit more Strength when participating in &quot;high end PvP&quot;.<br />
<br />
And now, the Lightning Generator. If you want to experience how it is to be screwed by Blizzard every damn week, roll a Warlock and be a Miner/Engineer. :-\</div></div><hr />

Wait, sorry, it's worse. What with having an instance chock-full of hard modes that you're going to have to forgo. (Note: I have Immortal, and I've replicated getting it a few times since the first time, and I still think it's stupid).<br />
<br />
Actually, it's far better. You can get most parts of this achievement while you learn the respective encounters, doing them so well that no one dies actually is a good sign you can try hard modes now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again because ppl are complaining that they spend 16k gold to find out it is not a normal mount!<br />
<br />
Actually the 'vehicle' mounts get nerfed because you couldn't get dismounted and could fall from any height.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not get why they release so small fixes, that does not seem an essential patch...<br />
<br />
<br />
So you want a 500MB interim patch every time? It's just a minor PTR patch, I'd rather have several small ones that address problems right away than wait days to weeks for one big patch that fixes 4 things and breaks 7.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you also can ask a mage for a portal to orgrimar and then ask a lock to summon him back when he repaired. All these options are viable but take too much time comparing to repair bot. <br />
And no, im not complaining about engineering, its you who complain, like other engineeres have been doing since the profession was introduced. You are just whiny community flooding forums with your whining without a reason, and people get eventually frustrated to hear how you have been mistread by blizzard all over again.<br />
<br />

The Ulduar gems are UE, JC will not get the needed nerf until whenever blizz introduce standard epic gems. It does get a slight nerf for tanking with the introduction of a second stam trinket, but that's about it :(</div></div><hr />

Defeat each boss in Ulduar on Heroic Difficulty without allowing any raid member to die to that boss at any point during that raid lockout period.<br />
<br />
What that says, if you apply reasoning to it, is that you cannot wipe to Freya, regroup, and then down Freya with no deaths and expect to earn Freya's credit for Immortal v2. However, what that does NOT say is that a death on Freya will disqualify you from credit on, say, Mimiron.<br />
<br />
It essentially says that you must earn a perfect one-shot kill of each boss. Nothing more, nothing less.</div></div><hr />

And at the same time they said that they would fix that one day in a future patch. So, you tried to get a edge that would be nerfed soon. Common, it's stupid to fall all the way down from naxx and not die because you're on a bike? LOL.<br />
<br />
And btw, you do compare a expensive mount with a repair bot? LOL. I prefer those bots. Unless you pay the mount for me. :) wait, let's just use the mount inside naxx! hahaha maybe inside the huge Ulduar... bah, die and run back for a minor repair... let's waste everyone's time.<br />
<br />
I don't think engineering sux, it could use some improvements due to ridiculous unbalanced stuff like JC (huge money inc + gems perfect for metagem requirements with huge stats? gimme that!), but it doesn't sux. Hyperspeed enchant is good, not get stuck anymore to a goggle to find gas on minimap is good (and stack with belt socket), having both a gathering prof + gas clouds in your mini map IS good.<br />
<br />
It does need improvements, BUT it's not the &quot;wostr prufssinon evah, ggthzbilzz&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I could understand with their immortal v2 change, for a player to get the title, he'll have to kill every single boss from Ulduar without anyone dying, not just join a &quot;immortal&quot; raid for yogg kill.<br />
<br />
That's a huge improvement.</div></div><hr />

No, i compare the expensive hog/chopper with the similar expensive grand war mammoth with vendor and repair npc on it. The fact i hate the mammoth look made me go for the hog, but now they are both just expensive moneysink mounts, they better add a repair/vendor bag on the hog/chopper mount to balance it. Tbh give it a nitro boost, ive never seen a slower motorcycle ever.<br />
<br />
Would be nice if Engineers could actually &quot;pimp my ride&quot; the motorcycle with some boost, repair bags, transporter (like the trinket), equip a parashute in replacement for fall dmg absord. Theres enough stuff to make this mount worth the 16k and give engineers some nice craftables that benefits other ppl as well.</div></div><hr />

I can do without it looking like an animal, but it was much better when you actually were standing on it and not sitting down with your legs extending below it. It's seriously one of the stupidest looking things in this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference being that in Ulduar it's on a &quot;per boss&quot; basis and not the raid ID, so it really is quite a bit easier to get the title over time:<br />
<br />
<br />
Defeat each boss in Ulduar on Heroic Difficulty without allowing any raid member to die to that boss at any point during that raid lockout period.<br />
<br />
So, if you take 25 people in and kill &quot;that boss&quot; with no one dying, they'll get the credit for &quot;that boss&quot;, and no one else has a chance to die to &quot;that boss&quot; in the same lockout period. Nothing to stop you going off and dying to every other boss in the instance after that, you'll still get the credit for the boss you did kill without the deaths.<br />
<br />
Then you can go back the next week and maybe pick another of the bosses, and tick it off the list, and so on...<br />
<br />
The only thing that will make it challenging is the relative difficulty of the bosses compared to Naxx, and that may take some time for certain guilds to work through.</div></div><hr />

True, to have it perform like the automated one in Magic Carpet Ride (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=11636) would be cool - just like it would be cool if you sat on a dragon's back, like on taxi dragons, not on his neck, since as a Tauren, even with the mount scaling, it looks as if the dragon's neck could break any moment.</div></div><hr />

Ontopic - the generator was fine for most classes but DK's made it rediculous, group that up with their 8k IT while being stuck in a hunter trap and there you have it, the reason they nerfed it. Even though me and my hunter both used it in 2v2 for the extra burst it still required you being able to take advantage from someone else's mistake or doing it during a CC-chain. I've seen paladin/dk's use it randomly with my hunter at 100% HP (thus making even a supose, 4.5k crit next to useless). All in all, I don't think the nerf was tooootally needed, but it's more than welcome for me, that's for sure - the crit ontop of the rocket boot crit buff aswell is awesome. 100~ extra crit here I come!</div></div><hr />

This is probably why they win right here. It's a very uncommon team, so people think &quot;lol, free win&quot; as soon as they see them and then proceed to get demolished. When played properly, the combo of warlock/mage cc will completely shut one person down while they destroy the other person.<br />

Everyone has your mindset of loldestro, so they go with faceroll affliction and so no one takes the time to try and master something they see as harder and a waste of time. It may be loldestro to most now, but 3.1 will definitely see a ramp up in destruction viability for sure.</div></div><hr />

A lock that will die in a couple of seconds or a mage that is so busy CCing that won't even do damage? Okay, let's pretend that works. Also, I'm a paladin, not a lock, so I don't know if I have the skill to play destro or not, and I honestly don't care since locks are too easy to play to be any fun, only hard part is using your pet well. The point of me taking it as a joke wasn't the fact he was destro, the problem is the setups he plays are absolute broccoli. Triple DPS as number 1 in a BG? That's rediculous, and in 2v2, mage/lock? What? Go face the FOTM paladin/DK facerollers inc. and get squashed in the mouth by someone with half a brain. If they CC the paladin and kill the DK, just bubble while your DK skills the lock out by popping def CD's and the magic shield crap, making him unstoppable, by the time your bubble is over the lock's dead. Oh man, that mage's gona kill us now, be careful! Not. Also the succubus is aweful, first off it's like 2 shotable, the seduce is dispellable, shares DR, you name it. Even as destro I'm sure (if they can even summon one, I have no clue) a fel-hunter will do the same thing and be alot more effective, it's being a mage and saying you don't need counterspell 'cos you've already got sheep.<br />
<br />
And about buffing destro in 3.1, bring it on, I'm tired of SL/UA locks that can't play to save their own lives being overpowered to tits in arena. Any change to destro that can trick them away from that steaming pile of horse feaces is more than welcome.</div></div><hr />
