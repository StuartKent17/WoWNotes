Armory Stats - Battle Pet Collection<br />
It Pet Battle Bonus Weekend, so we are starting by taking a look at the battle pet ownership achievement completion rate of players. Today's data is from 2.1 million players (not characters) that were active after August 1st.<br />
<br />
You can see some of the same data to compare to last time we looked at pet battle stats, two years ago (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3654-Armory-Stats-Battle-Pet-Collection-Blue-Tweets-Winter-s-Veil-Fan-Art).<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the Safari achievements (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements?filter-search=Safari) require you to collect every pet on that continent. The Raiding with Leashes achievements (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements?filter-search=Raiding+with+Leashes) require collection of every pet that drops from different raid bosses. Crazy for Cats (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8397-crazy-for-cats) and Celestial Family (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8519-celestial-family) require collecting specific pets.<br />

Mythic Dungeons don't count as dungeons for guild challenges while in a guild group? Intended?<br />
Not ideal, but a consequence of how the system was originally built. Challenges require queued dungeon activities (LFG) only. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/645013934160809984))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Except the &quot;alternative&quot; is always substantially less rewarding, so it will never be cared about. You can't just offer easy vs hard with the same rewards. Nobody will opt into hard &quot;just because&quot;. <br />
<br />
How can you be so sure? I always choose the hardest difficulty without knowing if I'll get better rewards<br />
The comment was specifically about group PvE content. If you offer 5 difficulty levels, all with the same rewards, and don't provide easy ways for other players to see others' accomplishments, then my experience is most players will see no point in suffering through the harder difficulties. Some will, but my expectation is that group will be small. In general, if players do more challenging content, they expect rewards appropriate for their accomplishment. Those rewards could be power based rewards, or they could just be recognition from other players.<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean players don't like difficult content. I like difficult content. But generally in multiplayer games, players want some recognition or outright rewards that they did it the hard way. I think the mindset is just different in single player games. I play Dark Souls because I gain satisfaction over beating it. It's harder to lean on personal satisfaction in a multiplayer game where players spend a lot of brain space comparing their accomplishments to others. In multiplayer games, the social element is typically pretty massive or it wouldn't be a multiplayer game. Recognition, in my experience, is an important part of that social element. <br />

Poll - How Many Battle Pets Do You Have?<br />
Please vote with the number of unique pets you have. You can get a fairly accurate count by checking the pets section of your armory profile (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/thrall/Avadakedavra/pet#status=is-collected).<br />

The mouseovers on the middle graph are wrong. The 1 rare pet captured mouseover says 200 pets, 10 rare pets captured mouseover says 1 rare pet and there are two columns for 50 rare pets capture, which one mouseovers at 10 rare pets captured.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tuesday the paladin</div><div class="date">2015-09-25, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The poll data vs the armory data shows an interesting difference between the MMO-C viewers that vote in a poll, and the community at large. At the time of this post almost 29% of votes have 600+ pets, while in the greater community less than 3% have 600+ pets. Quite interesting.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2015-09-25, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That poll is incredibly suspect. It proves 1 of 3 things:<br />
1.) MMO-Champion skews hardcore on every aspect of the game and so opinions regarding the non-hardcore (casual) audience shouldn't be taken seriously at all. Taking opinions seriously here would be like taking the CEO of Microsoft's opinion of how to repair a car over an actual mechanic's.<br />
2.) People are lying just to skew the results. Or they're not reading and just picking the largest number because &quot;bigger is better&quot;.<br />
3.) People that have quit before August 1st but still participated in pet battles before quitting are voting. In such a case, might be better to include options like &quot;No longer playing&quot; or do a separate poll for those playing versus those no longer playing. But regardless, people won't read and just vote resulting in the skewed poll.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I'd be more inclined to believe people are lying despite it being an anonymous poll. I'd also suspect many here lean more toward the hardcore than casual audience. Wouldn't surprise me if the official forums skew generally hardcore, too.<br />
<br />
On another note, 688 pets here with all (levelable) ones save 4 at level 25 and rare quality. So part of the 2.78% here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unique as in you only have that pet once. So if you have 3 rats, only one of them is counted as &quot;unique&quot;.<br />
<br />
My collection: http://www.warcraftpets.com/collection/Rixis/<br />
<br />
720 unique, 706 at max level (the other 14 can't battle). There are 6 people with &quot;better&quot; collections just on my server, though I am on Draenor-EU, a very populous PvE server.</div></div><hr />

He seems to know nothing about video games. 2 powers + an Ultimate is a MOBA quality only. Did he start playing games last year? He openly doesn't play any Blizzard games. Who the hell is this guy. He didn't list Starcraft barely mentioned Diablo. wtf who invited him to Blizzard. Is he some CoD badass or something? Or LoL? I've never heard a worse commentator, I'd rather hear someone scream like a girl and yell insults.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sethala</div><div class="date">2015-09-25, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@GC's tweet: I think there's two reasons why people don't jump at higher difficulty content if there's an easier version with the same rewards.<br />
<br />
First, because it's multiplayer, not everyone is going to have the same willingness to do hard content. Sure, you may say you play games on the hardest difficulty setting just because you like the challenge... but can you find a group of 10+ people that all do the same thing? And even if everyone likes starting at the hardest difficulty, are they all willing to put in the same time? How many will want to call it quits after 5 wipes? Getting one person to do hard content isn't the challenge, it's getting a group of people to all do the hard content at the same time and at the same rate.<br />
<br />
Second, a lot of this conversation is about difficulty for raids. Raids have a unique reward structure that says, essentially, &quot;you must beat this at least once every week&quot;. Attempting the hard content and failing means people feel like they wasted their time, because they still have to do the easy-mode again that week anyway. There's also the idea of player burnout for weekly content; if you've done the same fights week after week for a month or two, you're not as willing to try &quot;the same fight, only harder&quot;. (FF14's kind of hitting that problem with Alexander Savage mode, which is the same raid as the normal mode but significantly harder... although at least there's better loot from the hard mode.)</div></div><hr />

http://www.warcraftpets.com/collection/Draconis92/ Another mmo-champ user with over 600 pets. Don't forget that the 2.78% number is every single player while the poll is for mmo users =P I know I only clicked on it because I like battlepets so it's gonna be different from the total since mmo users tend to be more hardcore about the game than most other players!<br />

<br />
Not really that suprising. Casual players likely don't visit mmo-champion every day. For hardcore players it ain't hard to get to 600. If you don't care for breed, rarity and level you just need to battle here and there while travelling/questing and you already get a few 100....and if you want to invest 100k gold or so(which ain't that much these days) you can definitely buy another 100 from AH(and then some from the pet shop...but they don't count in my book, just like blizzcon/CE-pets. You just buy them for money. You could as well just buy an account from ebay...that's about the same.). I'd say 600 is easy, then the real collecting with a certain amount of dedication begins. I'm at 704 unique pets.</div></div><hr />

Thanks! Your collection makes me want to log on and buy all the pets that are available but I'd rather earn them the hard way! Wish I could get every dragon pet but the ones I don't own are unavailable :( it's what made me start collecting in the first place I love the wittle whelps</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because many people click on the link, to see how many pets they have and they see: 7xx<br />
&quot;oh i got more than i thought&quot;<br />

That would be normal. Some pets (Squire, Guild Page/Herald) are character specific rather than account wide.</div></div><hr />

Maybe some players dont khow the difference beetween Unique pets and the total amount of pets. That why there is such difference with data from Armory and the Poll!</div></div><hr />
