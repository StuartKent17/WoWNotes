Battle for Azeroth Beta - Waist of Time Pendulum Removed<br />
Waist of Time (https://beta.wowdb.com/items/162690-waist-of-time) was datamined in the last beta build with a swinging pendulum but the recent update seems to have removed it from the cosmetic belt!<br />
<br />

Mage Tower Artifact Appearances<br />
I understand their reasoning; they want this to be a prestigious badge of honor for future expansions, a way of saying &quot;I was there,&quot; but I really couldn't be bothered with that. I detest having content removed for the sake of &quot;I was there&quot; trophies, despite having a few of them myself. The Hordebreaker title and the Kor'kron War Wolf/Grove Warden* come to mind for me. <br />
<br />
I don't feel at all special for having a few more things in my collection, and why should someone who wants them later on not be allowed to get them? It's a shame, but that's why I always have to scramble to get everything that will be marked unobtainable before they decide to cut it for the sake of cutting it.<br />
Though it can be easy to have a differing opinion here, I believe this is a part of it. <br />
<br />
The Mage Tower appearance will be akin to the Legendary Cloaks and other legendary quest lines from recent expansions, wherein it will serve as a badge of honor from Legion saying &quot;I was here&quot; and &quot;I did this&quot;.<br />
<br />
I personally think trying to keep the Mage Tower challenge balanced and up-to-date would be a bit of a distraction from current content, and it's probably not something the development team would want to devote time to. I'd much rather the development team focus on Battle for Azeroth content, and make something like Mage Tower again in the future when the timing is right.<br />
<br />
This isn't anything new, so I encourage you to take opportunities as they are available to try and complete the challenge!

Worgen and Goblin Model Updates<br />
Blizz. What did I tell you about making public announcements and then not following thru? Remember.....its' not good. Do you remember the discussion we had? The internet never forgets Blizz!<br />
We haven't forgotten either! It's still something we want to do and are working on but, there just isn't really anything to update with currently. The last time we talked about it was at the Q&amp;A at BlizzCon where Ion said that we're still working on it but it wasn't going to be in 8.0.<br />

Hopefully soon™ we'll be able to share more info on this. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1090591-worgen-and-goblin-model-updates-v6/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759161059?page=18#346))<br />

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Keyring Slot<br />
The Keyring bag slot is a relic of the past, that most people probably don’t even remember. In a time when 18 slot bags were the biggest out there, and many unused items taking up bag space, dedicated keyring bag slots were a nice quality of life feature. In patch 4.2 a new feature was added which removed key requirement for most gates in the game, thus eliminating the need for a dedicated key space. <br />
<br />

<br />
Grand Expedition Yak<br />
Wrath of the Lich King had the Traveler’s Tundra Mammoth, and then Mists of Pandaria got the Grand Expedition Yak. Some may not remember, the initial version of this mount cost 60,000 gold before any discount, and it held two vendors. One of these was the usual Traveling Trader, and the other was an Arcane Reforger. After the Reforge system was removed from the game, that vendor was replaced with a Transmogrifier leading to this mount becoming the famous Transmog Yak.<br />

<br />
Cosmetic Class Accessories<br />
Class Accessories such as quivers for Hunters, vials of poison for Rogues, and tomes for Paladins were something that the community has been asking for. In the days of the Cataclysm, and previous expansions, some classes had a Relic slot next to their weapon, but these were never a visual addition to any spec. In 2014 an idea was presented, which would add further customization to characters, and allow cosmetic changes to these Relics without actually affecting the power level of the player. <br />

Overwatch Short: Hero<br />
This short takes place on Dorado, where Alejandra is sent to the store to pick up some flour. On the way, she runs into members of the Los Muertos, who are beating up an Omnic. After this gang steals her money, a mysterious soldier equipped with a Heavy Pulse Rifle and a Tactical Visor takes them on in a fight.<br />

Tomb of Sargeras Preview<br />
The third raid of Legion was featured in the usual Raid Preview blue post in 2017. After fighting through the Broken Shore, players reach the Tomb of Sargeras, the final point of invasion of the Legion. Deep in this temple the Avatar of Sargeras was locked away by Aegwynn’s ward, however after Gul’dan successfully broke it, the Avatar awakens. After defeating the Avatar, players got a chance to fight the demon lord himself, Kil’jaeden.<br />

I think Chris Robinson said they might revisit the idea at some point. With tier sets being removed, now would probably be a really good time to implement them, as a way to backdoor in some more class-oriented visual flavor without having to go all out on full armor designs.<br />
<br />
Then again, with the addition of all the extra armor geometry, character models are starting to get a little cluttered.</div></div><hr />

I'd much rather the development team focus on Battle for Azeroth content, and make something like Mage Tower again in the future when the timing is right.<br />
<br />
This isn't anything new, so I encourage you to take opportunities as they are available to try and complete the challenge! (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)(can't comment on this on the official forums because ha ha, not living in the US, so can't log on the US forums. Great design there BTW.)<br />
<br />
I'm 100% on board with the player's argument.<br />
<br />
This whole trend of Blizzard to REMOVE content to create some 'exclusivity' effect is RIDICULOUS. And I too have my legendary cloak, rings, curves, titles and mage tower appearances (well, about 10 of them)... but I only bother doing them when they're relevant because I hate the idea of not being able to get them when I want (which is usually in a later expansion when I feel like it). I missed the opportunity to get Atiesh back in Vanilla / BC, and now I get to live with that regret for the rest of my time on WoW. :s<br />
<br />
But it's also incredibly stupid to put SO MUCH WORK in content like Wrathion questline in MoP and Khadgar's campaign in WoD. I mean COME ON, there are so much voiced dialogues. There was a freaking cinematic with that campaign to see how Gul'dan managed to corrupt the Iron Horde, and to explain how Cordana fel to the Legion's side. Now, aside from maybe a few Youtube videos, you can't experience that by yourself, and that puts a huge hole in the narrative, which goes against the whole point of making a story : &quot;whoops sorry, this chapter has now been removed because we wanted to reward those who read it when it had just been published&quot;. Blizzard, HOW HARD would it have been to remove the legendary items without wrecking entire campaigns with them?!<br />
And EXCUUUUUSE ME, but the ring is now a worthless paper-weight, taking space in my bank so I don't see the point of removing it in the first place. An achievement &quot;you dit it when it was relevant, gg&quot; would've been just as efficient.<br />
<br />
I actually feel really bad for the new players who finally started to play the game now. All that content locked away from them... That's just sad.<br />
<br />
Then there's the artifact mechanic and the soon-to-be Heart of Azeroth, which are both bad ideas, in my mind.<br />
Yeah, I said it.<br />
Artifacts were just an alternate talent system, just like the Heart of Azeroth. Soon, our artifacts will be gone and all the time we spent on them will be lost. Most of these traits we took so long to get will be lost because Blizzard can't shuffle all of them in the standard talent system or baseline skills.<br />
It's just a huge waste of effort to develop features like the artifact system if it's just to remove it at the end of the expansion.<br />
We all know how often Blizzard tells us &quot;we can't do that, if we do, that's less resources placed on the development of the next raid&quot;.<br />
Blizzard should stop working on these features and start improving the ones that are rotting away. We're far from the point where Blizzard can go &quot;alright, we have resources to spare, let's make more temporary sh!t&quot;.<br />
<br />
Some of these artifacts (like Ashbringer or Doomhammer) have some pretty big Lore with them, and they're gonna rot in the shadows of our banks, as if they were in Lore limbo... I haven't seen any clue pointing to us giving some of them back to people who could wield them. Thrall should be get his Doomhammer back. Someone in the Argent Crusade deserves to get Ashbringer. The blades made from the pieces of Frostmourne could be brought back to the Frozen Throne. Felo'melorn could be given to a Sunreaver or to Lor'themar.</div></div><hr />

It is not just time gated/going away but in some cases rng gated due to legendaries and certain ones neing borderline required for some specs. <br />
<br />
Not everyone has the time to farm content for legendaries<br />
<br />
Add in mage tower potentially being down <br />
<br />
And add in learning tje fights if not outgearing them <br />
<br />
Annnd bam you have a thing being removed with 2-3 potentisl roadblocksm now you also need to do it on every character/spec to get them all? Woth insane gating? No not good design in THAT way. The tower itself is great but mix with limited time to run it and the legendary rng annnd you get some issues with it imo. <br />
<br />
My suggestion is either make it permanently active or make it so tje skin unlocks account wide come bfa if you completed it on even one character</div></div><hr />

Well here is the truth: This is another way to force returning players to get out of them some extra sub months --&gt; money. If you check the announcements for &quot;We will remove these!&quot; you can see they always do that in those months when the sub numbers go down. This is a really effective way to boost their reports for exact quarters.<br />
<br />
Blizzard gives 0 f*cks about content in the game... or about their devs who had work on projects (for weeks) just to be removed.<br />
<br />
Why do you give away Beta keys? The first scenario is buged... So you cannot even get out to level or do anything.</div></div><hr />

you are contradicting yourself - if its really that easy now then there is 0 reason to remove it when it will be equally easy in future<br />

It is easy, but it require minimal effort - you have to level, gear up, grab legendaries, level your weapon, buy/make consumables, learn spec, learn fight. If I could get MT on 120, I would just unsubscribe and later smash them during BfA - as human being I take path of least resistance. But it would be shitty game design, currently earning skins is more satisfying (win for me) and I don't leave for last months (win for Blizz).<br />
<br />
Of course they could take another path and retune it for 120, but this would mean that they'd have to retune 36 fights EVERY expansion from now on - and in the future specs may (and likely will change) a lot more than Legion-&gt;BfA. It's pointless to spend so much on content that will be 4+ years old.</div></div><hr />

It is not just time gated/going away but in some cases rng gated due to legendaries and certain ones neing borderline required for some specs. <br />
<br />
Not everyone has the time to farm content for legendaries<br />
<br />
Add in mage tower potentially being down <br />
<br />
And add in learning tje fights if not outgearing them <br />
<br />
Annnd bam you have a thing being removed with 2-3 potentisl roadblocksm now you also need to do it on every character/spec to get them all? Woth insane gating? No not good design in THAT way. The tower itself is great but mix with limited time to run it and the legendary rng annnd you get some issues with it imo. <br />
<br />
My suggestion is either make it permanently active or make it so tje skin unlocks account wide come bfa if you completed it on even one character<br />

Literally zero mage tower appearance require any specific legendary with current ilvl. And by &quot;current ilvl&quot; I mean what you can easily get doing dailys, lfr and one m+ a week.<br />

Initially in the Mists of Pandaria beta, it was listed as 60,000g. It was subsequently changed to 120,000g presumably due to mounts becoming account wide. On live, it's always been 120,000g at base cost.</div></div><hr />

Thing is, with the next expansion, many abilities/talents/traits will change, so the challenge would not remain the same. In some cases it'd become easier, in others it could even become impossible - for example, if your class loses the ability to interrupt/CC/dispel a key mechanic, suffers a heavy nerf to AoE, etc.</div></div><hr />

Honestly? It probably clipped through everything all the time unless maybe they were trying to do some neat physics to make with swing with how your character moved. Even if they pulled it off, the belt would probably be unusable with any robe/skirt because it would still clip through it during any pose/animation that isn't just your character standing there. Hell, even some races just standing around would have had it clipping into their legs and crotch with every swing. So I mean, neat idea, but it probably looked terrible in action aside from other concerns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know... really frustrating that we seem to be no closer to getting these things. I mean, yes, we kind of had them in Legion in a limited capacity. Marksmanship hunters had quivers and Holy Paladins had librams... but that concept art is just way more impressive than anything in-game. And they’ve clearly elected to not do anything with these in BFA. No quivers, librams, ammo pouches, poison vials... nothing.<br />
<br />
Add to that the fact that there is no indication of Retribution being able to use the Holy artifact for transmogrification. Or Beast Mastery being able to use the Marksmanship one (assuming Blizzard fixes it before BFA launches (the quiver on the Marksmanship skin is glitched to not be on your back, but underneath your feet currently in the beta)).<br />

With the game becoming more and more focused on cosmetic rewards and progression, now would have been a great time to add little flavor items like these. But no. Just another thing on the very long list of things Blizzard would “like to do someday!” Translation: “We’re holding this idea just in case sub numbers drop to dangerously low levels. If that happens we’ll announce a bunch of new features to lure players back, including cosmetic class accessories.”</div></div><hr />

Because why did they not remove Dragonwrath and it's chain? Just like with transmog rules, same crap... <br />
And indeed, who the hell cares that someone played in Legion? <br />
Whats more, the cut legendary quest lines leaves story progress in the old continents with quite big holes, which are noticable. All that content is wasted...</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you'll subscribe later rather than today ? That's still 13 dollars in Blizzard's pocket right ?<br />
<br />
I can get both sides though. I don't really like removed stuff, for obvious MMORPGs reasons - some guy who made a break during MoP and WoD will never understand what happens there because legendary quests are heavily lore-oriented. But I get that some cosmetics must remain as &quot;exclusive&quot; to give people an incentive to play. But for this, I think the Titles should be enough (along with the mounts going from 100% to 1%, that's enough to create rarity). Titles (Fearless, Chosen, Titanslayer etc) should be Prestige titles and get completely removed while obsolete.<br />
Transmogs, on the other hands, should not be removed imo. Especially when they're already easy to obtain with minimum involvement during the expansion (like Mage Tower are or previous expacs Challenges).<br />
<br />
Honestly, there are a few classes I've not played during Legion because I don't care. But if in BfA, those classes are lit and I'd like to play them, I would hate that some transmogs are not accessible just because I didn't bother farming AP, Leggos, Tier Sets etc during Legion.<br />
<br />
At least, they should unlock transmogs once you've done the same Mage Tower on one char (for example if you've done the Twins on a Frost Mage, all Twins transmog - Afflock, Boomkins, SP, MM - are unlocked for you once BfA hits).</div></div><hr />

Ehm, in current system I subscribe both now (for Legion stuff) and later (for BfA stuff). If MT would be obtainable at 120, I would subscribe only later (for BfA stuff) and smash MT in 5 minutes (similar like I clear old raids by transmog, but they won't keep me in game alone). Logic is not your strong point, am I right? ;P<br />
<br />
And for the rest of post - yeah, just quests (including Mage Tower) should be available all the time for lore reasons, I don't know anybody that is against it.</div></div><hr />

You have to have fast reaction time otherwise you have no chance. Most of the 30years + cannot do that. their are too slow.<br />
<br />
I am older than 30 and did all 36 challenges months ago. I don't raid, I don't have a mythic+ group for my characters, it's all casual play and determination. Probably also over 20 years of gaming experience (not only WoW, of course).</div></div><hr />

You can use Mortal Coil trick that will completely cheese the fight. Blizzard never fixed it, so I guess they are fine with that.<br />
As someone rather low on ilvl (915) and struggling to complete the affliction lock challenge, I would love to know the &quot;Mortal Coil Trick&quot; that blizzard had never fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Summon infernal pet, make him passive.<br />
2. Stand near Karem, let him hit you and spam pet attack at same time. Karem will attack only infernal from now on.<br />
3. You can move pet (don't forget to tell him to attack Karem again) to bring Karem close to Raest.<br />
4. Stand at max range of your Mortal Coil, dps Karem, but save cooldowns for Raest.<br />
5. Most important. You must time Mortal Coil perfectly. As soon as Raest will start talking (at 33% Karem), hit Karem with Mortal Coil.<br />
6. Karem won't go for Purgatory (he still fight with infernal), Raest become target dummy, you only have to be careful with basic adds. I don't know if he ever hits another phase, at 930 item level I burned him rather quickly.</div></div><hr />

I remember that Blizzard just removed my achievement for it instead of making it a feature of strengh.<br />
I remember and will never forgive.<br />

I was wondering what happened to that achievement because I could have sworn I had it. Now it all makes sense. <br />
