Dev Q&amp;A and Class Balance<br />
I think the big problem is the balance discussion in the QA came over a bit high handed or even a touch meanspirited.<br />
<br />
While it is likely not exactly as it was intended, the whole 'we know yall need buffs but if you become the top spec it will upset the peole who play that spec so no love for you' impression taken from the QA was sort of crappy, especially for people playing Elemental or Frost - who also dedicated a lot of time and AP in the hopes that they would be buffed not to be better than Unholy or Enhance, but on par.<br />
Sorry to hear that it came across that way. <br />
<br />
Just to be clear, I was trying to explain why we sometimes may seem conservative or slow with balance changes. Frost mages were used as an example of a spec that we do feel is currently lagging behind in raid and dungeon gameplay, but not by nearly as much as data from public log sites might suggest. It seems less disruptive to buff a spec incrementally, allowing time for the results of each change to play out and repeating if needed, rather than risking overshooting the mark. (And yes, we definitely have failed in this goal at times - post-launch rogue spec balance comes to mind.)<br />
<br />
At the heart of balance concerns is the fact that people just want to be able to feel like they have a place in the endgame as their preferred class/spec, and we entirely share that goal. Class balance is an ongoing process, with new variables coming into play all the time, as item level increases, new trinkets, legendaries, and set bonuses enter the mix, players get deeper into their respective artifact trees, theorycraft evolves, etc.<br />
<br />
The Q&amp;A didn't delve into specific details because the exact list of changes is and was still evolving. There will be a new 7.1 build on PTR very shortly, and patch notes to follow. That patch contains some improvements for several of the specs that currently are currently underperforming (including both flavors of Frost). Those changes should in general move things in the right direction, but we'll be continuing to watch and adjust further as needed.

Karazhan PuG Requirements<br />
That already happens in 5-man heroic and regular mythics runs.<br />
<br />
There's nothing inherently wrong with having premade groups with inflated min ilvl requirements. <br />
<br />
The game gives players enough freedom for them to organize themselves in any way they want, it’s part of the social aspect of the game and extremely important for any mmorpg. <br />
<br />
Some geared players might just want to do a few fast runs and thus will use a very high minimum ilvl requirement on their heroic or mythic runs. <br />
Others (more altruistically) might instead put an even lower ilvl requirement than LFG has, just to help a few friends gear up more quickly than they’d do on their own.<br />
<br />
In the end, nothing is stopping anyone from starting their own group with the ilvl requirement they feel is more appropriate for any particular content. It’s all in the hands of the player (save a few hard caps here and there).<br />
<br />
GL in Karazhan! Hope you enjoy all the surprises it has in store for you and all the nostalgia moments! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/776416-lfm-karazhan/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613693027?page=3#49))<br />
<br />
Mythic Keystones<br />
This was one of the things touched on in the Q&amp;A last week.<br />
<br />
We definitely appreciate it's a frustrating experience having someone dropping mid-run from a keystone group. It's something we've been looking at but haven't yet come up with an alternative that wouldn't invite more serious abuse of the system.<br />
<br />
If you can swap in other people, the party leader could theoretically replace people with his friends. If your keystone didn't deplete if someone dropped, it would invite people to ALT+F4 or drop as soon as something went wrong which reduces the associated challenge of a mythic keystone run - particularly at the higher end.<br />
<br />
Keystones are plentiful right now, and if one run doesn't work out, then another one might. We like the social aspect of people finding new friends via the Pre-Made Groups finder who then link up later on to tackle higher difficulty keystones.<br />
<br />
In an ideal world it's best to go with people you know, but realistically that's not always a possibility. That's why it's always a good idea to make sure everyone is on the same page at the start of the run, before the keystone is even used. If it's intended to be a 3 chest run, communicate it. If you're just going for the clear, communicate it, so you don't have someone drop mid-run because they wanted multiple chests. <br />
<br />
Again, we understand that it's a frustrating experience to be involved in, and it's something we're continually monitoring. There have been some interesting suggestions in this thread, so please keep those coming.

Havoc Demon Hunter<br />
Moving to the Demon Hunter forums.<br />
<br />
I somehow missed part one of this thread, sorry for letting it cap out. I'll review this in the morning and get some questions out to the development team so we can share some insight on upcoming DH changes. Hopefully I will be able to help explain our thinking/philosophy here.<br />

Paladins and Crusade<br />
What do you mean by &quot;potentially incorrect datamined information&quot;?<br />
<br />
Up until the most recent PTR build, every datamined change was reflected on the PTR version. As of right now, Crusade isn't even functioning on the PTR, and the tooltip has reverted to the live version (except all of the numbers are replaced with 0).<br />
I assume this is a PTR bug that you're seeing.<br />
<br />
An update on this from the development team: we've reverted the change on PTR that folks were seeing from datamined information. Crusade will be staying the same in 7.1 as it is on live currently.<br />
<br />
We may take another look at this skill in the future (design-wise), however, and when and if we do so we will look to the community for feedback.<br />
<br />

Warlock Talent Changes<br />
Got some answers from the development team on this.<br />
<br />
The aim and ultimate goal of the swap is to create competition in the talent rows, with a secondary intent of adjusting tankiness and mobility overall. With this change (taking tuning into account), there should now be more interesting choices in some rows, instead of the usual feel of &quot;mandatory-ness&quot; that we've seen in this past cycle.<br />
<br />
Demon Skin previously dwarfed its competition in nearly ever situation, and its combination with Dark Pact offered too much survivability.<br />
<br />
With Demonic Circle, we heard the broad feedback about how it was missed when players had to opt-out of taking it because of better picks in its row. Now that it's lined up against more equally-powered and niche talents, we believe Demonic Circle will see more use overall.<br />
<br />
Hope this answers some of your questions - I'm here for feedback and discussion on this. ([Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20749707131?page=2#31))<br />

<br />
Some arena players and raiders were crying about the lack of mobility. Blizz said they wanted us to be tanky. Then proceed to nerf our tankiness in the first hotfix .then again now in 7.1. Then gives whiners what they want. Hopefully they will realise how bad their decision was.<br />
<br />
I am against the change. I think this is a terrible decision for both pve and pvp and circle won't change much. This is far from Blink, have a cast time, requires a set up etc etc. <br />
<br />
Loosing dark pact or this passive shield is a major nerf. Our class is currently the least popular / played class as well as underperforming both is high lvl pvp and pve (best spec being middle of the pack, the worst one being lowest dps spec currently in the game). Yet they nerf further more.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note: the comment on Kharazan about premading requirement is pretty funny. Blizz saying: &quot;It's not our fault if players are ***holes with their requirements, gearscore is great&quot; is pretty much like a gun dealer selling a gun to a gang member and saying it is not my fault if someone got shot. Pathetic.<br />
The idea of forcing premading can be good if you have a nice communauty. But WoW's pug pop is toxic at best 90% of the time. You might still find nice people out there but most are pro wannabes.</div></div><hr />

what's stopping you from farming it when it comes out? Don't like grouping with random people every week? Or will you be one of those asshole that ducks out of the place if the boss doesn't drop it when you're there?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arbs</div><div class="date">2016-10-18, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a side note: the comment on Kharazan about premading requirement is pretty funny. Blizz saying: &quot;It's not our fault if players are ***holes with their requirements, gearscore is great&quot; is pretty much like a gun dealer selling a gun to a gang member and saying it is not my fault if someone got shot. Pathetic.<br />
The idea of forcing premading can be good if you have a nice communauty. But WoW's pug pop is toxic at best 90% of the time. You might still find nice people out there but most are pro wannabes.<br />
<br />
Well that has been Blizzard's fault since Cataclysm they have allowed it to grow, Before it wasn't an issue when Server Communities existed. But now that they were basically killed off. But also if you don't like how other people make their premade groups than just make your group.<br />
<br />
But their is also fault on the players themselves, since Cataclysm as I mentioned above it has become a bigger issue &amp; what came out around the same time. LFD / LFR &amp; Cross Realm. Everything has side effects, they may open up system to becoming more accessible, but you than have people who abuse that. Now their not 100% the problem they just help make the problem worse. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard added in a Prefer this Player or Avoid this Player option for LFD that could really help alot. Now Premades is free game &amp; no restriction or other system needed. You don't like a premade just make your own group.</div></div><hr />

I feel like this is an oversight.<br />
<br />
Not all ghosts even fly. The manner of their creation is completely different. This isnt an oversight. This does not even matter. its been 10 years, this is utterly irrelevant. The headless horsemen was enabled to fly with a horse that has flaming hooves. Attumen and his horse were not.</div></div><hr />

Every dungeon difficulty should be queueable (at least before mythic+ which is a special case). I would rather have PG requirements back (silver for heroic dungeons, gold for mythic dungeons and LFR on top to item level requirements). It was quite a farce in WoD, that heroics had a PG silver requirement, but LFR had none.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Make your own group&quot;<br />
<br />
Great. But no tanks or healers will join the lower geared groups. So the tank-less and unhealed groups never get into the instance.<br />
<br />
This is one of the facets of the wow &quot;community&quot; that made me quit playing, the &quot;I got mine, screw you&quot; mentality. <br />
<br />
It's nothing new, either. In Vanilla it was all &quot;just join a guild&quot;. But the only decent guilds were requring resumes and tryouts and requirments that worked out to the same as a part time job. So nobody got into the guilds, and just sat in trade for hours. <br />
<br />
So they invented LFG and LFR for those people. And, it's been shit on ever since. Now it's so dumbed down, it's not worth playing - and we're back to sitting in town all night hoping a tank or healer takes pity on players who want to run content at the appropriate levels, instead of blasting through overgeared. <br />
<br />
Yay.<br />

You know you can still join a guild. That hasn't disappeared. <br />
<br />
And guilds only asked all that stuff if you were going to raid with them, not just for joining. A simple questionnaire asking your experience and &quot;can you move out of the fire&quot; was/is just there to stop you wasting 39 other peoples time if you're just some lazy ass who turns up and dies all the time and doesn't care or want to learn, the same reason the trial time is there. It was not like trying out for a job. Any form i've ever filled out to join a guild could be summed up as &quot;What class/spec are you, and are you capable of moving out of the proverbial fire&quot;. If you can, most of the time you had nothing to fear and if you can't then that makes you part of the selfish &quot;screw you&quot; mentality. It's not unreasonable to expect people in your team to pull their weight. <br />
<br />
Especially in vanilla where you had some naff rotation and raiding more or less was just move out of the fire a lot of the time. Do you think it's unreasonable to expect people to move out of the fire? <br />
<br />
And if you are a class that can heal or tank, take some initiative and be the healer or tank.</div></div><hr />

I was going to as well but they aren't Cata hard. If you are even LFR geared, they aren't that bad.<br />
They aren't challenge mode where your iLvl is averaged out. So long as you can follow DBM -- you'll be fine. They were only hard the first few weeks.<br />

Because they want to carry a friend and there are no consequences for being that kind of dickhead.</div></div><hr />

Unlikely to happen for a couple reasons. <br />
1. Attunemen is now the 4th boss due to how you enter the dungeon (side door not front door)<br />
2. Kara is on a weekly lockout<br />
<br />
So no real need to drop the group if the mount doesnt drop since you are half way in and cant just find a new group and try again.</div></div><hr />

Nice that it's the 4th boss, that mostly solves the issue then</div></div><hr />
