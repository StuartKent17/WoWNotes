When he started out, he was an outcast. Then he proved his worth and his determination, gained the respect of his peers, grew extremely powerful as time went on... eventually went into self-imposed exile to learn more powers from even more powerful beings, and then comes back to kick more ass against his old friend he always refused to kill and believed could be redeemed.. then starts wearing a long trenchcoat and looking like an ermit.<br />

I like majority of Velen's model. But does his general frame not seem kind of similar to a night elf? Something about it.. I almost wish they had kept the thin sharp features going throughout the whole body. The waist and below still seems a little scrunched up or broad or something.</div></div><hr />

I think the art team people said they were gonna revisit his, Jaina's and the models of other faction leads once they were done with the player models in order to keep them on par with the rest of the game.<br />

Well I never said I liked this one either. But yes, I suppose it does.<br />

Thank god, I thought I was the only one with this problem; and I've tried viewing in Chrome, Firefox, and *shudder* ...IE.<br />

Can someone please snatch the Thrall image and post it somewhere like imgur? And maybe possibly convert it to a PNG or something while you're at it?</div></div><hr />

I wasn't talking about liking or not, though, just comparing the two :)<br />

Maybe make him a little bit wider since it's supposed to be &quot;a different time&quot; or whatever but he's supposed to be a Blademaster. Thin around the waist and a little in the legs, buff in the arms and upper torso.</div></div><hr />

Beta generally refers to huge, public testing phases, alpha can be both pre-beta state or selective invitations and small tester pool.<br />
<br />
Hence why they calling it alpha now, they will only invite people that will actually provide qualitative feedback.</div></div><hr />

Invitation status has absolutely zero to do with what stage of development it's in.<br />
<br />
It IS beta in development, and the actual words, form.<br />

But Blizzard has to be different I guess.<br />

The only thing that bugs me about Velen is his beard being attached to his robes, but I suppose as someone else said the clipping issues would otherwise be insane so it's best that way. Otherwise I'm loving the models! So lovely!

Yeah all we've gotten was a stag form we should've had to begin with.<br />
<br />
Cheetah form (which is a glyph) is unchanged. Still looks like any ol' cheetah you'd see out in the world.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, in cataclysm ALL the drud forms was remoddeled...ALL...But ok, it may be enough for a while there are another classes there..No...Wait, why not give a Stag form in MoP as well? Or maybe put some armor in the boonkin form, why not? Ohhh, how about another Aquatic form too? It gonna be awesome...<br />

<br />
Remember when Thralls model was updated in Cataclysm his first version was with a hunch-back, I believe this isn't the final model of the Warlords as well, we can see in the Blizzcon trailer that Groom stands more eretic..so..<br />
<br />
And I have to say this, I play in the Horde and I not enjoy play in the Alliance, but if the Draenei male end up looking a little bit like this Velen, I'm gonna change factions in a second.<br />
<br />
But isn't this thrall a younger thrall as per say... The xpac after this which should go back to regular timeline, will get another thrall update in which he's much older lol.. Maybe i'm wrong</div></div><hr />

i qoute : <br />
<br />
I know right, they do the same with Druids, looks like every expantion they have new models, cat form, travel form, aquatic form but look at the Shaman's spirit wolf, same model since the Vanilla...<br />
<br />
your words...<br />
<br />
tbc : no new models. wotlk : no new models. <br />
<br />
you just admitted yourself that not every expansion they have gotten a remodel<br />
---------<br />
above all this. your ghost wolf. how often do you use that in combat? dungeons? raids?<br />
<br />
us druids have to look on that same skin day in day out. <br />
<br />
gaurdian druid who just got a new piece of gear? dont expect to ever see it!<br />
cat druid with a new weapon? betcha you aint ever gone see it!<br />
<br />
dont think you have much reason to complain about the shaman ghostwolf look. because atleast you have alternatives</div></div><hr />

You don't often use Ghost Wolf in combat, whereas Druid forms, that's all they get to see 99% of the time when fighting. You also got a bunch of new elemental models and a new transform yourself.</div></div><hr />

I mean yeah this is an alternate Draenor, but once again he's always been a lean Orc canonically.<br />
<br />
Blackhand on the other hand reminds me of Deathwing if he assumed an Orc form, which is meh. Could be better...Durotan on the other hand looks great, wishing dearly the wolf head/cape he's wearing will be available in game, now that would be a slick cloak/helm option. The giant belt is a bit meh since it makes him look smaller than he'd actually be, but that's a minor adjustment. Thrall is...ok...too bad players won't be able to get the non-hunching Orc model he uses. Spacegoat...uh is he supposed to look different? Looks no different to me, though its not like he's that interesting anyways.</div></div><hr />

Duratar looks great, Thrall aswell thank god he leaves his shammy life style behind and returns to his warrior ways and put his armor on again.<br />

Velen is also a nice design looks like the male draenei is going to improve alot.<br />

Because at the time when WOD happens, Thrall wasn't born yet, so Thrall is the exact same Thrall we know. The Thrall who got kidnapped as a baby. There is no Incarnation, it's the same guy.</div></div><hr />

Thrall is our Thrall, he was born on Azeroth after the fel taint was a thing. There is no Draenor Thrall equivalent because he's likely yet to even be conceived.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depending on how many years have passed he technically could be a newborn, as he was born nearing the midpoint of the second war. Or his parents could've been extra busy baby making as they weren't off being exiled to alterac, so he might even have an alternate brother or sister that exists in alternate Draenor.<br />
<br />
...or Garrosh, coming from our timeline, could've simply killed alternate Thrall as soon as he was born because of his experience with Thrall here. Probably what I'd do if I were him, just in case.</div></div><hr />

Now, almost every blade found looks like it was carved/chipped out by 6 year old Neanderthals!<br />

<br />
I say Blackhand looks like Garrosh in Deathwings armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grom was very young back in the day (it is said in &quot;Rise of the Horde&quot;), yet he looks older than Thrall and Durotan. EDIT: Grom was also supposed to look thin and have a black jaw.<br />
-Why is Blackhand the Deathwing version of Orcs?<br />
<br />
Well for Grom dont forget Garrosh is older than Thrall and Grom is Garrosh's father as well as Durotan is Thralls Father. As for Blackhand His sons killed Durotan in current Azaroth and when you encounter them they are pretty old so Im guessing Black hand is pretty old to and probably not likely to be alive today without some sort of mechanical or magical aid.</div></div><hr />

Dude, he's leader of the BLACKROCK ORCS who live in a mountain filled with lava and iron as they enslaved other races and crafted obsidian armor and fearsome weapons for the Black Dragonflight and the Orcish Horde (now the Iron one) war machine. Lava and Iron is his thing! more than it was DW. The guy is a a completely badass blacksmith.</div></div><hr />

Or his parents could've been extra busy baby making as they weren't off being exiled to alterac, so he might even have an alternate brother or sister that exists in alternate Draenor.<br />
<br />
...or Garrosh, coming from our timeline, could've simply killed alternate Thrall as soon as he was born because of his experience with Thrall here. Probably what I'd do if I were him, just in case.<br />
<br />
<br />
The horde stagnated for years after the destroyed the draenei. at this point in time Durotan and Draka wouldnt have had a baby yet.<br />

The only problem i have with this models: Thralls eyes should be blue, not Durotans. Also the ponytail is a bit weird.<br />
<br />
where you think thrall got his eye color from? :P</div></div><hr />

It's a closed F&amp;F Alpha.<br />
It is called &quot;beta&quot;, despite it being the alpha version, because that's what Blizzard labeled the files as.</div></div><hr />

Sigh....it's called a Top-knot, and it's something that the orc Blademaster's in WC3 had(inspired by Japanese samurai). It's part of Thrall getting in tune with his heritage. Thrall is dropping his titles of Warchief and World-shaman to go on a quest of self-discovery, so it fits PERFECTLY. It's my favorite change to his model(beyond losing the hood) by far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, Im wondering if Thrall will be the hero we know he is today. Remember, it was his trials and ordeal he faced while being enslaved by Blackmoore after he killed Thall's parents. Without that, would Thrall still become the hero/diplomat/warrior/warchief/etc that we know? Will be interesting to see how his story plays out.<br />
<br />
Or will there be 2 thralls? One from this world that chased Garrosh back through the portal and the one that was born and raised on Draenor...actually there could be 2 of a lot of people for that matter.</div></div><hr />

If i recall correctly we go back to before thrall was born and his parents killed, there won't be 2 thralls.. Atleast not for the time being.</div></div><hr />

Yeah 2 of the heroes here are dead so either a this expansion sends us back in time or b they're resurrecting them either way this consistent back &amp; forth with story content oh classic is suppose to take place more or less during &amp; after Warcraft 3 that's why u kept adding &amp; removing content then altering quest lines like 50times right? Bc is after Warcraft 3 really so why is the reign of chaos still in the dark portal while illidan has the scar on his chest from when Arthas was doin missions as a death knight for the banshee queen sylvanas? It's quite obvious the new story writers you have just breezed through the original Warcraft story line that's not even factoring in Grommash never was born or ever came down from the sickness effecting orcs making them red skin unlike his son. From being exposed to it as a early child so why is he red unless this takes place in the future when he's dead. so what? Thrall is goin to Rez him then he comes back red skinned &amp; Frankenstein? Do you really want to trash such an honorable hero of the horde that way blizzard?<br />

Oh to top it off you're altering how haste works yet again with dots &amp; hots when you blizzard practically openly admitted to having a hard time balancing pvp partially do to cc dr &amp; a consistent rework patch by patch of rescaling pvp power &amp; resil in fact why did u even add pvp power if you were goin to force scale resil might as well have not even invented the stat. All these new &amp; old changes blizzard still hasn't balanced out &amp; you thought to yourselves hey let's change how haste works with periodic spells cause that's a great idea when you still havnt figured out all these other imbalances &amp; bugs lots of bugs you guys are neglecting to fix or even pay attention too with this new technical support you Blizzard have neglected us your players=customers with this automated support &amp; lack of game masters system. Did you know there is a bug that's been here since mop 5.0 when the expansion came out that's consistently used in arenas where warriors have the ability to charm players &amp; use their spells such as heals on themselves? Like fix your game fix your story cya again in 2 years for the patch you intend to charge us for again for lvl 100-110 or 105 &amp; I'll look at the reviews for balancing &amp; bugs to see if it's worth my time <br />
