Patch 7.1 Hotfixes - Trial of Valor<br />
Trial of Valor Normal and Heroic got some nerfs to the Odyn and Helya encounters. <br />
<br />

Patch 7.1.5 PTR - Secondary Stat Changes<br />
In the latest PTR build, the amount of rating you need per 1% of Critical Strike, Haste, Mastery, and Versatility was changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Critical Strike - Now requires 400 rating per 1% Critical Strike, up from 350.<br />
Haste - Now requires 375 rating per 1% Haste, up from 325.<br />
Mastery - Now requires 400 rating per 1% Mastery, up from 350.<br />
Versatility - Now requires 475 rating per 1% damage and healing increase, up from 400. Now requires 950 rating per 1% damage taken reduction, up from 800.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.1.5 PTR - Artifact Knowledge<br />
Patch 7.1.5 makes catching up on Artifact Knowledge easier for new players and alts!<br />
<br />
New Players / Main Character Catch Up<br />
<br />
The Artifact Research Synopsis (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144395-artifact-research-synopsis) allows you to turn in (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/46125-furthering-knowledge) 500 x Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources) for one Artifact Knowledge level, up to 15. <br />
These are BoP items, so you can only use them on the character you complete the quest on. <br />
<br />
<br />
Alt Characters<br />
<br />
The Artifact Research Compendium items are sold by the Artifact Knowledge researcher in your Order Hall for 1000 x Order Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources). <br />
These are BoA items, so you can purchase them on your main character to send to alts. <br />
These only allow you to purchase a book with lower Artifact Knowledge than your current Artifact Knowledge level. <br />
For example, characters with Artifact Knowledge from 15-19 can purchase Artifact Research Compendium: Volumes I &amp; II (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144434-artifact-research-compendium-volumes-i-ii), granting their alt Artifact Knowledge 10.<br />

<br />
Legion Season 1 Ending Clarifications<br />
With today’s announcement of the end of Legion’s first PvP season on December 13, we’d like to clarify a few extra details.<br />
<br />
The Elite PvP gear appearance will be the same in Legion Season 2 as it is in Season 1. If you are unable to complete your set in Season 1, you’ll still be able to collect your missing appearances during Season 2.<br />
<br />
Additionally, after Legion Season 2 concludes, we’ll be adding the ability to purchase the complete Elite appearance set from a vendor. This will only be made available to players who have earned access to the Elite set by reaching a PvP rating of 2000 or higher in any Rated Battleground or Arena bracket during Legion Season 1 or 2.<br />
<br />
Finally, we’d like to clarify that the end of Legion Season 1 and beginning of Legion Season 2 are not tied in any way to the release of Patch 7.1.5. One of our major goals for Rated PvP in Legion is to have PvP seasons change over more regularly, which means we can now transition between seasons without requiring a patch. This transition will occur prior to the release of Patch 7.1.5.<br />
<br />
<br />
FEEDBACK: Lower Nighthold (Heroic)<br />
We're opening up the Nighthold raid on PTR, with Skorpyron, Chronomatic Anomaly, Trilliax, and Spellblade Aluriel available on Heroic difficulty. We'll be leaving these bosses up for a couple of days. Please use this thread to for feedback or bug reports on any of the encounters. When providing tuning feedback, please note the nature of your raid group (e.g. Mythic guild group, PUG, etc.).<br />
<br />
<br />
Nighthold Testing<br />
Watcher explain why we should test your dungeon you don't listen to feedback<br />
Well, part of the point of opening Nighthold and leaving it open for a longer period of time is to let groups get in and give contextual feedback on class mechanics, as well as to gather data to help with tuning. If we were solely interested in polishing the encounters, we'd be doing short 1-hour tests that could be observed by the encounter design team in their entirety. But this approach lets a lot more people get in and try things out.<br />
<br />
Basically no numerical tuning based on 7.1.5 changes has been done yet: in test builds and development, the primary initial focus tends to be on qualitative design changes, both to allow for time to iterate on them, and because there's a much smaller development window during which we can make large changes to text in tooltips (since everything needs to be translated for the game's different regions before a patch can be finalized). Numbers changes are best done when designs are closer to final (there's little point fine-tuning something that may get ripped out entirely next build), and can be done very late in the PTR cycle. Raid tests like this help tremendously with that process.<br />
<br />
The past couple of weeks have been full of distractions, with a long holiday weekend in the middle, and we haven't done a great job of communicating regarding the 7.1.5 class and systems changes. We'll be working to correct some of that in the coming days, but I understand that there's more than a little frustration and distrust to overcome.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I'll rename this thread, and make a new one for Nighthold. Please try to keep that one clear for feedback and logs from the instance, so that everyone can have a more polished experience in the long run. Thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.1.5 Warlock Feedback<br />
Feedback: you're leaving the warlock community out in the cold. Please communicate with us. We are extremely desperate.<br />
We agree with a number of the core concerns raised, but don't have immediate solutions (or those solutions will take more time to design, implement, and test than the 7.1.5 PTR cycle affords). A couple of examples off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
<br />
Steady/predictable Ember generation suited the Destruction rotation well, and something important was lost in the course of unifying the class to use a single shared resource, but fixing that at this point isn't just as simple as rolling everything back to Embers.<br />
Mechanics like Demonic Empowerment and Soul Effigy are cumbersome to manage and while they have strong spec-specific theming, the actual gameplay of using them drags down their respective specs.<br />
<br />
<br />
We're probably too reluctant to acknowledge problems for which we don't yet have a solution to present. But the fact that we haven't yet changed something doesn't mean that we think it's perfect as-is.<br />

you buy the compendiums on your main and send them to alts for 1000 resources. (alt catch up)<br />

the single use ones for 500 resources, are for new players (or mains) who havent hit 20 AK yet. (general catch up)</div></div><hr />

I'm confused aswell.<br />

<br />
It uses any research you already have sitting on that character, if any. This way you can't use the book to get to 15 and then use a bunch of past research to get even farther.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc14d85b5354</div><div class="date">2016-12-01, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It uses any research you already have sitting on that character, if any. This way you can't use the book to get to 15 and then use a bunch of past research to get even farther.<br />
<br />

Almost. You can buy the book for AK 5 when you have AK 14, not the book for AK 15. Once at AK 15, you can buy the book for AK 10.</div></div><hr />

So if My hunter reaches AK 20 will I then be able to buy: Artifact Research Compendium: Volumes I-IV to get a newly dinged alt to level 20?<br />
Or is there anything else I need to buy?<br />

<br />
You can buy 1-15 for 500 Resources Each. This is meant for people just joining the expansion on their main. <br />
<br />
For people who have Artifact Knowledge 15 or higher on a main, they can buy items for 1000 Resources that are BoA that instantly grant a character Artifact Knowledge 10. <br />
<br />
If they have AK 20, they can buy an item that instantly grants a character AK 15. <br />
<br />
If they have AK 25, they can buy an item that instantly grants AK 20.<br />
<br />
In short, the BoA ones are meant to be cheaper alternatives for people with alts, and extend further past where you can go with the basic catchup. (as once you hit 25 on your main, you can buy the BoA tome to go all the way to 20 on an alt, instead of 15 500 at a time)<br />
<br />
When 7.1.5 comes out, we'll most likely be at AK21-22, so expect a couple weeks after 7.1.5 being out before you can get to AK20 on alts rather easily.</div></div><hr />

At 20 you will probably be able to buy Artifact Research Compendium: Volumes I-III (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144431-artifact-research-compendium-volumes-i-iii) and get the alt to AK 15. It is always one tier lower than would be useful for you, as it is intended for alts.</div></div><hr />

That's not going to change when every stat is getting nerfed. This change is because they don't want people doing a billion DPS by 7.3, like what happened in Mists with SOO or WoD with HFC.<br />

Okay, so Blizzard's idea of having immediate solutions is just buffing/nerfing numbers in the tiniest and hoping for the players to be/act happy. <br />
I've been playing Warlock since the day I started this game and it was FUN. I was able to do good stuff, people would like me in their group and that wasn't just because I have summon stone or healthstone or CR. Warlocks were actually useful. Even WoD was a better time for to be a Warlock, it had good single target, it had good AoE(Charred Remains, duh), it actually had mobility(Burning Rush not being in the same row with Demonic Circle, which happened to be a core spell). It was actually useful. But right now, I'm just getting declined applying M+ groups just because I'm a Warlock. I love this class and Blizzard is just drowning my baby right in front of my eyes and I can't do shit about it.</div></div><hr />

hahaha nice joke .. rofl <br />
if they wanna fix the secondary stats .. they should remove this crapp once and for all .....or they should be sure the right stats comes on the right items for the right classes ....it cant be that a DH gets an 880 breast with haste mastery , and they say its better just cuz it got 300 aggility more ....while a breast plate with 865 and crit+versa should be worse while it got the right stats ....<br />

They said they wanted a higher ilevel item to always feel like it was a good drop and an upgrade. It often doesn't now because the loot specialisation doesn't really work and you can end up with like a 10-15 ilevel better item that's complete crap because it's got useless stats on it. So as usual, instead of improving something, they nerf something else to make it look better. <br />
<br />
So basically the way of making primary stats better is to make secondaries worse. It's what they do when you got one good and two junk talents: nerf the good one.<br />
<br />
The intention is I am sure to make ilevel the deciding factor on items: no matter the stats, higher ilevel will be better.<br />
<br />
On the PTR my affliction warlock - freshly copied - has gone from 125% of 118% Mastery. So my dots will hit for 8% less. The primary stats don;t seem to be upgraded, so basically...this is a massive nerf for everyone. <br />
<br />
It also sounds to me as though this is an easy path to make the raids harder. Just nerf everyone's damage.</div></div><hr />

They wanted Fire, specifically Fire, said by name, to get a lot of crit from gear early because &quot;having to wait till the last tier to really feel your class mechanics isn't fun.&quot;<br />

You are both right and wrong. Each player has 8 mastery &quot;points&quot; before gear/passives are considered, much like how each player has 5% crit before gear/passives are considered. The display of mastery changed in MOP to be less technical and more direct, but has worked the same way under the hood since its introduction in Cata.<br />
<br />
350 mastery on live gives you a bonus 1/8th of your base value at 110. The mastery &quot;points&quot; are different for each class and spec, but still exist under all that window dressing.</div></div><hr />

<br /> 
You get the BoA catch up ítems for people with alts. <br />
<br />
TL;DR: Once used it grants AK level as stated in the tooltip and uses all your alts Research notes if any.<br />
<br />
That's how I understand it.<br />
<br />
Say by the time 7.1.5 goes live I have a main with AK 23; I can buy the Artifact Research Compendium: Volumes I - III which would grant my alt AK 15. It would be so simple and super easy if they just put &quot;Grants Artifact Knowledge 15 on use&quot; on the tooltip, but people might try to abuse.<br />
<br />
I could have my alt right know (7.1) get its research notes and never use/read them, say I gather 10 of those (by the time 7.1.5 goes live); Then when 7.1.5 hits live I could send my alt the Volume III, my alt would reach AK 15 and then I would use the 10 research notes I saved and reach a total of AK 25. That would put my alt at a higher AK than my main.<br />
<br />
So it takes into account your alts current AK level and also the amount of research notes in its bags/bank/etc if any, then grants the level it says in the tooltip. In total giving you a total of = tooltip number - current level - research notes in bags/bank.<br />
<br />
Finally you have the BoP 500 Order Resources catch up mechanic for players that got in late and need to get to everyones level.</div></div><hr />

Dude, they just admitted the class devs are too incompetent at their job to fix LONG standing issues, in any relative decent length of time. <br />

Here I'll tell you the response to rogues<br />

&quot;We're reluctant to talk about issues we can't fix due to the in-competencies of our class design department. <br />
<br />
here are a list of problems<br />

We're too incompetent to fix them any time soon, maybe in 8.0 but certainly not until we hire competent devs which we may or may not be doing.&quot;<br />

Oh, and for at least Unholy, the one legendary that kept us competitive is getting nerfed. Essentially, could be worse, you could have an obvious problem and no feedback.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that unholy dks use castigator that revolves around crit making it a wanted talent thus making those bracer needed(just to play the way the spec should) but they nerf them due to being OP and popular and are now going to be even more popular due to low crit and SS not bursting more then 1 wound.

I definitely beleive Celestalon and crew bit off way more than was good for them this time around. They're making some pretty big changes, on class design that should have been baked in and only needing some tweaks at this point. <br />
<br />
So if they don't talk about a class, we can assume they're broken, and you don't have a fix yet? This is a GREAT message to put out there! <br />
<br />
We all know Blizzard moves slow. But it's at the point where they can't afford to. Celestalon and crew at this point look to be redesiging every class throughout the expansion - that kind of instability is game killing. <br />

No it's not. It's smart 15 is the perfect number. that means a new player can quickly get into the newest raiding content and not need months to catch up. This isn't rocket science.</div></div><hr />

The Artifact Research Synopsis allows you to turn in 500 x Order Resources for one Artifact Knowledge level, up to 15.<br />
<br />
Who cares this system is very ideal for returning players to be able to quickly catch up with their friends and for those who have a lot of alts.. And who really cares if new players have a catch up mechanic.. Not like they are going to level 15 right away not when it will cost them 7500 order resources which early on is not really viable since there are many other things those resources are spent on..</div></div><hr />

Actually, playing normaly you will have 9kish resources after finishing order hall campaing, which give 5k. You also would not have expensive class hall upgrades because 3rd one for 1k take 7 days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not a fix, it just makes our toon weaker once the patch hits and collecting new gear just to get to where we were in the first place before the patch.<br />
<br />
No.. the PROBLEM was secondary stats being too good compared to primary stats. By the time you get the gear to the same secondary levels like you say above, your primary stats will be much higher, so you will be beyond where you are now. Primary stats would and should be the most valuable.</div></div><hr />

The next build will have changes that increase the total amount of stats given by all items above level 800 to account for this gap, such that the overall power of your equipped items should be about the same (if not slightly higher) than it is currently in 7.1<br />

<br />
Sorry but you are full of it, not the fellow warlocks. Devs acknowledged that there is a problem where warlocks are at at the moment, in terms of mechanics and numbers but they haven't got a solution for it. <br />
<br />
Just because some sims showing demo in the top 3 dps, which doesn't apply for 99% of the fights, which requires movement, doesn't mean the class is in a good place. Even a split second of movement for demo will break the build up for the artifact ability therefore make you lose 15 secs or so for the next round. <br />
<br />
Just because your dps team is low or undergeared than your warlocks, doesn't mean, the class is not broken. Blizzard Devs acknowledged it so if you don't know the class, stop sharing crap and look like a fool.</div></div><hr />
