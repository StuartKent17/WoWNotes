<br />
I really like the new sets. Definitely reminds me of what I saw happen between T5 and T6. Of course, I should reserve judgement until I see the Paladin armor, which will be very interesting to see what they choose for that, given the fact a Paladin is a knight of righteousness and there is only one sort of creature (Varkyl) which would be the Priest armor inspiration I am sure.</div></div><hr />

Did I just fall into topsy turvy land?<br />
<br />
Why is the San'layn being tied to mages, when all of the San'layn creatures in the game cast shadow and fire magic?<br />
The same with locks being liches when liches cast mostly frost magic, with a bit of arcane and shadow.<br />
<br />
Also, ow. Some of those NEONBRIGHT mage sets just hurt my eyes to look at.<br />
<br />
Is this some sort of naming error, or are mages just getting a set that I personally think looks like relentless gladiator gear, but significantly worse, just so warlocks can look all evily?<br />
<br />
It's like &quot;Hm, let's give warlocks skulls and stuff on thier gear, because that's evil.&quot; &quot;Yeah! We'll make them look like liches / necromancers!&quot;<br />
&quot;... But wait, what's left for mages then?&quot; &quot;Mreh, give them the lame vampire clothes; they're casters too, I guess. Oh, but tone it down a bit, too, we don't want the mage set to look as good as thier's.&quot;<br />

<br />
If that's neonbright compared to some of previous sets...<br />
<br />
And as for being associated with the only real 'casters' in the Scourge army, I think I can handle it. It's sort of a large jump to say 'Blizzard fixes our most irritating debuffing ability, so naturally they'd want to offset it with making us look ugly.' Be reasonable here.<br />
<br />
And am I the only person who loathed T6-9?</div></div><hr />

Er, bugged? ToC belts anyone? either they are really just &quot;bugged&quot; so they also gonna fix the all the ToC belts, or this is a way to make them look more... 3D.

This is what pop ind my mind when I saw the warlock head:<br />

And that sucks to look like that... &gt;_&gt;<br />
(Can I size down the pic, without saving it on my computer?)<br />
<br />
I dont even know what KKK is, but it's something over in the USA, so I guess I cba, but still it was the first thing that popped in my mind. And it's ugly xD<br />
<br />
Mages armor is cool on the other hand immo, even though the metal is over done, or whatever you say..(call it)<br />
<br />
Just did a little research in the KKK, it's something todo with racism.. hmm.. &gt;_&gt;.. blizzard please change the warlock head :(</div></div><hr />

KKK was a racist group that pulled black people out of their homes at night and burned them on a cross and I have to say it doesnt look like that. It looks alot more like Ner'zhul, like some people already mentioned. As far as I know, Blizzard never took ideas from outside their game to make tier sets.</div></div><hr />

Hey guyz, Mage class wears plate now.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I first started playing (late sunwell), I didn't know anything about the game, nor how to look other player. I really thought that warlock could use plate. And they did look sick.<br />
<br />
Warlocks look really good.<br />
<br />
Human mages look awkawrd, but humans always do. Trolls are just insane.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. The mage set looks nice on BEs, Uds. I like the red color, yes finally something different from the usual mage colors. Make it look like cloth and not plate and i might end up enjoying it.<br />
<br />
That said, it looks shit on female humans like i thought. Oh and before one of the lore fanboiz come in again with the San'Layn story, i don't care, i seriously don't care. Say they had a big pile of shit as helm and shoulders, would you wear it? Probably, i guess.<br />
<br />
Another solution would be to let us have the race change services, so i can play what i want!<br />
<br />
Edit: for some reasons i like the green version more then the red one :o</div></div><hr />

I was hoping Blizz was going to bring their A-game on the final tier set of this expansion but the mage set is full fail regaylia. Why does our set have to look like a mix between Liberache and a colorblind Twilight vampire? I&quot;m keeping my t9.5 helm for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
C'mon, why are you just jumping straight to racism issues, people!? The helm has a Halloweenish touch imo, and looks SupaCool! I never leveled my Lock, but I have to admit, this helm is so tempting ::)</div></div><hr />

<br />
on the gnome it reminds me of Vivi the caster from FF9, only a wicked sort of scarecrow twist, the stiching is the cherry on top. One of the coolest cloth tier designs ever IMO</div></div><hr />

Someone don't got a problem being racistic in public?<br />
I suggest you think about what you just said, or how it could be interpreted by others.<br />
<br />
I really don't see the problem of remodeling the tier head, of course there is always someone who like and dislike it.<br />
I probably gonna hide it, since I don't think it matches the rest of the gear. But that's my opinion about the look.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tehlilone</div><div class="date">2009-10-19, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally overall like the warlock set. It reminded me of Oogy Boogy when I first saw it and I &lt;3 him. Not loving the stitching done on the middle of the robe tho. The gnome warlock's robe looks fine w/ proportional stitches but the others have HUGE stitches keeping that robe together. That makes it look stretched out ridiculously. I personally like the purple most and blue a close second.<br />
<br />
As for the mage... I think it's not horrible per se but it could use tweaks. With this set, skin showing on the arms seems a out of place. Also, like a lot of people I hate the helmet look. If anything I'd like to see it closer to how the bosses is and the current T9 with an open top. The side view during the video reminded me of a bowling ball someone set on one of those chairs in a bowling alley. I personally love the red color and like the purple one. But I dislike the green (too earthy) and the violet (reminds me of naxx) ones. There's the belt too... waaay too big. It's like the hips want to fall off.<br />
<br />
Also, whats up with the gloves? I go back to my arm comment... if you choose to make a set show some skin then commit to it. Covering up the head excessively but leaving the arms and hands showing seems to undermine the whole design. Choose to cover completely or show a lot of skin and I think it'd be more awesome. IMHO that's what makes this set look odd.<br />
<br />
anywhoo those are my thoughts on these two :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akabane</div><div class="date">2009-10-19, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very nice warlock threads. They should stick with the Fel Green color scheme.</div></div><hr />

Very cruddy mage threads. They should ditch the Fel Green color scheme.<br />
<br />
But honestly, if they either showed more skin (Mostly around the chest area, so we could wear the wraps in Dalaran, and -ACTUALLY- get an undead look going) or covered up the arms and hands more, changed the colour of effects from a felfire green (maybe to like, blue or something more mage-like? NONE of our spells are green... Arcane lightning, maybe?), maybe added some eye effect (To make the hood a bit more interesting than our constant hood + robe look) I would be satisfied.<br />
As it is right now, I feel like we just got a remodeled Furious set that looks worse than the Furious set itself. Sure, hard work was spent on it, but the design team seemed to really not want us to stand out from other casters. Atleast T8 had a rather unique look to it. I feel like I'm downgrading going from Kirin Tor Battlemage Gear / Sunstrider's Regalia to a standard hood and robe with essentially nothing special about it. Give us more magic! And making it fel-magic makes me feel like I'm just a beta version of a warlock. Or was that the joke, Blizz?<br />
<br />
T10 = Epic. Simple as that. This set =/= Epic, in my honest oppinion. It's just a set people look at and go &quot;Well, it isn't horrible. I kinda like it. It could grow on me.&quot; All in all, the set feels really uninspired, and just feels like a cross reference between arena gear and the San'layn robes, coming out looking worse than either. The &quot;fixes&quot; I'm proposing mostly don't involve remodeling anything, too. Modeling sucks, and takes the most work. This is just a basic retexture, recolour, and hover effect. *Shrugs*<br />
<br />
TL:DR - Green glow, gotta go. Make it blue or something magey; we're not warlocks. Show skin or cover it, don't do both. Glowing eyes might make the hood less bland. Feels like cross of San'layn robe and Furious, but both of those seeme better than the set as it stands. This is just my oppinion, for good or bad.</div></div><hr />

Not as ridiculous as the rogue or the druid T10, but still pretty bad.<br />
<br />
So far, only the warrior looks halfway epic, albeit with a broken helmet.<br />
<br />
I fear for the priest and the paladin set.</div></div><hr />

Need I go on?<br />
<br />
Really?<br />
<br />
This game has loads of tier sets, dungeon sets and what not that have much less detail and originality compared to the new sets. Granted, you may like some of them (I don't for one think shaman t1 is that bad looking, rather silly and comical), but overall especially t8 and what seems to be t10 have in this expansion showed especially graphical quality that is alot higher. Even t9 was higher quality, even though it wasn't as unique due to Blizzard going for a more uniformal look.<br />
<br />
For comparison sake, some random t8 sets:<br />

I notice the mage in T8 isn't showing the helmet. Interesting.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Robur</div><div class="date">2009-10-20, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The crazy gear scaling was not by design... it is the consequence of retroactively adding so many raid difficulties with equivalent rewards.<br />
<br />
In the next expansion when the stats are modified (taking away spell power, for example), that will also require an overhaul of ability dynamics including how much damage is done. When the damage is adjusted, I expect developers will rescale everything so that well-geared level 80s questing in the new expansion aren't one-shotting mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, items won't have SP, but you will still have it on your character, caused by intellect. Which will still be on items.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard had to make it simple somewhat for themselves with all new gear from levels 1-60, maybe even 70-80, having all the quests reworked and items re-done for the time after cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From fast Googling, I could only find proper images of human males with the t8 and human males are just silly so I went with the other picture I could find. Personally I also like the helmet.<br />
<br />
Even if your post is very hilarious, original and smart, it's wrong in what linking that picture was implying.</div></div><hr />
