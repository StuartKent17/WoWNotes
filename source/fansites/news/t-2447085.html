Mamytwink Interview with Jeremy Feasel and Tina Wang<br />
The French site Mamytwink (https://www.mamytwink.com/actualite/interview-blizzcon-2018-nazjatar-mecagon-exploration-des-iles-et-fronts-de-guerre) interviewed Jeremy Feasel and Tina Wang on some interesting Battle for Azeroth topics.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/mammytwink.jpg (https://www.mamytwink.com/actualite/interview-blizzcon-2018-nazjatar-mecagon-exploration-des-iles-et-fronts-de-guerre) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nazjatar Zone<br />
<br />
Nazjatar's detailed operations are still being worked on, but the team loves the rare spawn system from the Timeless Isle and the idea of meeting criteria to spawn a rare mob or having some that don't spawn often that causes players to come together for an unexpected moment. They want these moments to happen in Nazjatar.<br />
Nazjatar is a big landmass while Mechagon is smaller and focused around the mega dungeon. <br />
Nazjatar is a very unique environment with coral, kelp forests, and geysers.<br />
Nazjatar is really the first time people with see true Naga culture and architecture. in Vash'jir we mostly saw Night Elf ruins while Nazjatar has bioluminescent abyssal buildings.<br />
You will need to take a boat to reach Nazjatar as it is located far away at the edge of the Great Sea.<br />
The team has discussed having old school PvP objectives in Nazjatar similar to the world PvP areas in Burning Crusade (Auchindoun, Halaa, etc). <br />
Something that has been talked about are recurring events during which the Naga regain control of Nazjatar by seizing three towers. This causes terrible effects and you feel that Azshara's eyes are everywhere and that she is trying to regain control. Players would need to work together to regain control of these towers.<br />
In War Mode, these towers would also be able to be taken over by a specific faction in order to increase the rewards in Nazjatar much like the towers in Hellfire Peninsula.<br />
The team wants to grow upon the escort system and have new allies in Nazjatar accompany you into the world, level up, and have you discover their story through quests. <br />
<br />
Mechagon<br />
<br />
The team wanted to create another mega dungeon after all the positive feedback from Karazhan.<br />
The main lessons they learned from Karazhan was the timing to complete the dungeon and the level of loot drops that it offered. <br />
Mechagon will have unique loot and you will want to come back even after the next raid.<br />
The community appreciated that Karazhan was split into 2 wings in a later patch. They plan to do the same for Mechagon.<br />
<br />
Island Expedition AI<br />
<br />
When the team was developing the Island Expedition AI they implimented it into a bunch of areas, including sending teams of NPCs into Arathi Basin.<br />
It was during these tests that they realized that the AI should jump so that they felt more like players. <br />
<br />
Warfronts<br />
<br />
The team has seen players lose Warfronts already, specifically near the beginning of their introduction when low item level players were queing and couldn't handle the mobs.<br />
Heroic Warfronts will require more coordination and to play in groups to react to the enemy NPCs.<br />
Examples of this include having to escort troops that are summoned or having to retreat to defend your base from enemy units.<br />
PvP Warfronts are always being discussed internally, but there is nothing to announce about adding them at the moment.<br />
<br />
War Mode, Incursions, and PvP<br />
<br />
Wintergrasp is returning as an epic battleground soon.<br />
Incursions are meant to drive home the faction war.<br />
Each faction will have the chance to defend or attack based on the location of an Incursion. For example, if the Horde attack Tiragarde Sound, the Alliance Incursion quests will involve defending their lands while the Horde ones will be on the offensive.<br />
There are special abilities that are accessed during these quests that can be used on hostile NPCS but also player characters in War Mode.<br />
Things like ships exploding in the sky, cities on fire, and the Horde trying to blow up the Boralus gate with an iron star are used to really show the war aspect of the Incursions.<br />
The team hopes Incursions and the increased rewards will push more people into War Mode to create huge battles between the factions in the world.<br />
<br />
Lore and Story<br />
<br />
During the Crucible of Storms raid, the factions will learn that there is something dark under the sea and that a portion of N'Zoth is right under the Shrine of the Storm.<br />
The team has plans for the branching story between siding with Saurfang or Sylvanas.<br />
The team loves the idea of the Heritage Armor quests because it allows them to develop lore from the past for the races of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Graphical Improvements<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth introduced many new graphical options such as dynamic weather and placing filters such as the fire used in Siege of Boralus. More recently they have greatly improved the management of the graphics processor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Lost Codex Interview with Alex Afrasiabi &amp; Patrick Dawson<br />
The Lost Codex (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwQtOSKXmGA9Hvd5JWXpPEA) sat down with Alex Afrasiabi &amp; Patrick Dawson to discuss the story and systems of Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8nGnT6WZbeI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Vol'dun<br />
<br />
The Sethrakk did not evolve from trolls.<br />
The trolls abandoned Vol'dun after it became a desert.<br />
Mythrax was a general in the Aqir War mentioned in chronicle and the events of Vol'dun's past occurred during this war.<br />
<br />
Drust and the Death Realm<br />
<br />
There is a relation between the Drust and Vrykul. They came from seafaring Vrykul clans.<br />
The Death Realm is an offshoot of the Dream/Nightmare.<br />
Thros is an isolated part of a land of nightmare and death.<br />
<br />
Large Scale NPC Battles<br />
<br />
Creatures in the distance that can't be interacted with are not spawned server side. This allows the team to have many npcs on screen at once such as in the Lordaeron scenario and the battle in Dazar'alor seen during the Horde campaign.<br />
They first used this technology in the Siege of Orgrimmar.<br />
<br />
Allied Races<br />
<br />
There is no pattern to creating an Allied Race. They want races that are cool and contextually important.<br />
With that said, Allied Races need to have animation rigs, which is a limitation to some degree, but as with the case of Kul Tiran Humans, new animation rigs can be altered and created.<br />
Alex believes that Kul Tirans should be able to be mages, and says the team will discuss it further. He can't promise that it will happen, however.<br />
There is a chance that new customization options could be added to the Void Elves to fill the High Elf fantasy.<br />
There is a chance that there might be changes to the acquisition of Heritage Armor in the future.<br />
<br />
Lore, Story, and Feedback<br />
<br />
Loa who died during the Zandalar campaign are not necessarily dead forever. <br />
Collaboration is key when it comes to player feedback. They are always listening and talking about feedback even when they don't necessarily agree.<br />
The team knew adding a choice to the Sylvanas/Saurfang quest chain would mean that they have to deliver on creating a narrative choice with meaning that has consequences in the future, and thought that this moment was a good time to experiment with this idea.<br />
Choices like this are a test, but Blizzard wants to do them.<br />
People removing their shoulder pads as a movement to stand with Saurfang was a powerful moment for the team and is really what drove them to want to create this branching story choice.<br />
There is always a chance we could see Yrel and characters from alternate Draenor again.<br />
<br />
<br />

Inside a Methodical AWC 2018 Championship<br />
This was a record-setting year for the World of Warcraft Arena World Championship (AWC), which saw the most LAN tournaments and largest prize pools to date. And at BlizzCon, scene veterans witnessed the resounding domination of North American teams, which culminated in the first-ever NA vs. NA finals match in AWC history, Method Orange against The Gosu Crew.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/awc201801.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/awc201801.jpg)<br />
<br />
Dispelling the Curse<br />
One member of Method Orange, Chuck “Cdew” Dewland, has flown close to the sun for years. As a long-term Arena healer for Method, Cdew’s teams have placed from fifth to second place at BlizzCons past. But this year Cdew and his team finally broke through, as Method Orange became the first NA team in five years to win a WoW championship at BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
Rivals All the Way<br />
In a post-match interview, Method Orange’s Michael “Samiyam” Hlubek said The Gosu Crew “were definitely scary to go up against. As the group we feared the most, we hoped they’d get knocked out by another team, but it wouldn’t be a tournament without facing them. It felt really good to win against so many great teams; it feels like we really earned these trophies.”<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/awc201802.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/awc201802.jpg)<br />
<br />
The Gosu Crew pride themselves on not focusing on multi-classing, mastering multiple classes to adapt to various team compositions. Instead, the team meets their competition head-on with absolute mastery of their main classes. And Method Orange did not shrink from the challenge. The eventual champions did their homework and brought their best game on the final day of BlizzCon 2018, delivering a definitive 4-0 sweep in the best-of-seven final series.<br />
<br />
To The Gosu Crew’s credit, as Method Orange racked up wins against them, they stayed true to their philosophy, declining to try and answer their opponent’s momentum by switching to backup classes. Both teams have much to be proud of—but, for now, congratulations to Method Orange, your 2018 World of Warcraft AWC Champions!<br />

Hearthstone Reaches 100 Million Players<br />
Blizzard announced (https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hearthstoner-welcomes-100-million-players-virtual-tavern) today that Hearthstone has hit the 100 million players mark. To celebrate, there will be a special in-game event from November 7th through the 11th. During the event, players who log in to the game will receive a one-time reward of six free packs from the most recent expansion set, The Boomsday Project. In addition, players will be able to complete a series of “Celebrate the Players” event quests to earn up to 500 gold—which can be used to acquire card packs from any set in the game and participate in the Arena mode.<br />
A little over five years ago, a few Blizzard Entertainment developers were toiling away on a small passion project: Hearthstone®, a free-to-play digital collectible card game at a time when such games were not front of mind for most. They based the game on the company’s Warcraft® universe and polished every aspect—from the flash of the animations to the bombastic voice lines of the heroes—and launched it to critical acclaim globally in 2014. Today Blizzard announced that Hearthstone has hit the 100-million-player mark.<br />
<br />
“Reaching 100 million players is a huge milestone for Hearthstone, but what matters to us even more is the fact that so many people around the world have embraced the spirit of the game,” said J. Allen Brack, president of Blizzard Entertainment. “Whether at events like BlizzCon® and Fireside Gatherings or just in tuning in to watch their favorite streamers, it’s been so inspiring to see millions of players and fans coming together, online and in real life, to participate in the Hearthstone community.”<br />
<br />
A Thank You to the Players<br />
As a way of commemorating Hearthstone’s 100-million-player milestone and thanking players everywhere for bringing the game to life, Blizzard is holding a special in-game event from November 7 through 11. During the 100 Million Players Celebration event, players who log in to the game will receive a one-time reward of six free packs from the most recent expansion set, The Boomsday Project™. In addition, players will be able to complete a series of “Celebrate the Players” event quests to earn up to 500 gold—which can be used to acquire card packs from any set in the game and participate in the Arena mode, a fun alternative form of competition in Hearthstone.<br />

<br />
There's always a 'chance'. It's highly unlikely to happen. They had months of feedback regarding this when void elves were revealed to when they were put in the game. They ignored it completely. <br />
<br />
But hey, I think high elf fans should be really excited about this and keep pressuring Blizzard, if they want this in the game. Otherwise they're likely to forget or not care.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Stormbringer</div><div class="date">2018-11-05, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad to see they might do Kul Tiran Mages.

<br />
So....why do we have void elves, lightforged, Dark iron dwarfs, kul tirans and most likely mecha gnomes?!?!?!<br />
<br />
Because void elves, lightforged and dark iron dwarfs barely make sense.....they are just there because they where lazy and did not want to give us a decent version of void/blood/high elves, they did not give us broken and dark iron still only has a bit lore with moria....and yet to see any good story from them.<br />
<br />
As for cool looking...4 of them suck.<br />
void elves: just blue smurfs with weird bikini armor. They could have made them WAY cooler<br />
Lightforged: Just light nazi dreanei. Again weird armor. Should have been broken.<br />
Dark iron: look cool.<br />
Kul tirans: are just fat inbred humans with cheap druid forms ( 1 texutre spread over old models. instead of everything new like zandalari trolls), with ugly armor again.<br />
Mecha gnomes: Instead of cool mad max/cyberpunk gnomes or real full on mecha gnomes...what do we get....so weird jimmy neutron style mecha gnomes...<br />
<br />
There is NOTHING cool about the alliance allied races. Most of the suck story wise, how they are made etc etc</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kul Tirans are contextually important. The druid forms are pretty cool to most people.<br />
<br />
Dark Iron Dwarves are cool and contextually important. We recruited them to help with the war effort (thats the context).<br />
<br />
Void Elves are now like the 4th most played alliance race, so obviously the majority of people think they're cool.<br />
<br />
I agree LF Draenei and Mechagnomes are kinda terrible, though. You seem like you should just play Horde.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to type this slowly so they understand (not that they read these forums but...): I...DO...NOT...WANT...WORLD...PVP. I don't want it. I'm not going to queue up for War Mode, I'm not going to flag for it no matter the rewards. If I want PVP I'll go into a BG. I wish Blizz would stop forcing world PVP on people.<br />
<br />
Back in Classic people would just attack the Crossroads or Org or wherever for reasons (not even achievements) that centered around the fact it was fun. Now? Times have changed and honestly I avoid world PVP like the plague.<br />
<br />
The ONLY exception to this would be if they're offering like a piece of 390 gear for completing a relatively easy incursion where I HAVE to flag for War Mode temporarily to complete the incursion. Then I would treat it like a battleground in my mind. But I sure as heck would turn it off right after.</div></div><hr />

Given how edgy you are, one would think void elves would be the perfect fit for you (even if in the lore, they are actually pretty humble). <br />
<br />
Especially love the part where you called lightforged draenei &quot;nazis&quot;. Stay classy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol....so i am angry at the state of the alliance ( with is poor if you use facts :D) . But i can not have that opinion without being called a emo...( news flash the /silly pretty much say they are emo's in blizzard eyes ) :P<br />
<br />
And again....look at alternate Dreanor .....they are ...that is what blizzard made the light into...that and rest of argus patch made it clear they can be light fanatics...so ?<br />

<br />
Kul Tirans are contextually important. The druid forms are pretty cool to most people.<br />
<br />
I agree that people can find them cool. But not that they are great designs. They are just the old druid model with 1 texture on them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dark Iron Dwarves are cool and contextually important. We recruited them to help with the war effort (thats the context).<br />
<br />
Being usefull as cannon fodder does not make it a great story race...contextually important would also mean they have story's to tell. Last time i checked...they do not. Hell not even a great sub leader etc to add to the mix.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Void Elves are now like the 4th most played alliance race, so obviously the majority of people think they're cool.<br />
<br />
Again...can not argue if other people find the cool. Its their opinion.<br />
And with the concept of the race i have no problem. But the story is extremely lacking ( almost no lore) and their design is just bad. They are blue on blue on blue. They could have added way more flavor and way more effort into them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree LF Draenei and Mechagnomes are kinda terrible, though. You seem like you should just play Horde.<br />
Nope...why should i play horde because blizzard decide's to make crappy allied races and crappy story's and crappy everything for the alliance. Its that kind of thinking that has 80% of the raiding people over on the horde side. <br />
And i do not want them to make ALL allied races for the alliance to my opinion. There can be ones i do not like and do not play. But all of them suck. All of them have little to no effort put into them. That is my problem with them.<br />
<br />
Take for example the heritage armor. You can not argue on what people find pretty. But if you look at the effort, the details, the exclusiveness of the horde vs alliance armors you clearly see a difference in effort and details etc.</div></div><hr />

And again....look at alternate Dreanor .....they are ...that is what blizzard made the light into...that and rest of argus patch made it clear they can be light fanatics...so ?<br />
<br />
I'll be honest here. The reason I am calling you edgy is because you are overexaggerating how 'omg awful' everything is with ridiculously over the top descriptions.<br />
<br />
Comparing a character to a real life nazi is especially tasteless. I hate how the story for alternate draenor plays out (even before Yrel goes full-stupid), but they are not 'nazis' in any sense of the word nor do they have any connection to speak of in comparison to lightforged draenei that are playable. (The closest thing to nazis this game had were Garrosh's personal orc army in Mists of Pandaria, and even then I would be loathe to call them 'nazis' as it's such a shitty comparison to make.)<br />
<br />
Calling void elves 'smurfs in a bikini' or Kul Tirans 'inbred fat humans' to exaggerate how much you dislike these races (for reasons you didn't actually elaborate on) doesn't really help your case either, but comparing a character to 'nazis' is just over the top pettiness.<br />
<br />
If you want to talk about how you dislike races that's fine, but be realistic and don't be petty about it. If you said &quot;I find lightforged draenei boring because they don't have very distinct customization&quot; I'd disagree but probably wouldn't even post about it, and I certainly wouldn't call you out on it. When you are posting things like &quot;Dark Iron are a terrible race&quot; then &quot;dark Iron look cool&quot; then it just leaves me scratching my head. It implies you are trying to say &quot;all Alliance allied races are bad&quot; even though they aren't all bad. That hurts your argument all the worse.<br />
<br />
And in most of these cases, you did not provide what you think could have been done instead, or provided very vague examples (What is a mad-max gnome? Sounds cool, but what even is that?), leading one to believe that you are complaining merely for the sake of complaining rather than trying to provide an opinion that could be utilized to improve any of these races.<br />
<br />
In short, if you want to be taken seriously, don't be petty. That's really what it comes down to. Voice your complaint with opinions that can be understood and used instead of pointless insults that express nothing other than &quot;I dislike this race for reasons I am unable/unwilling to elaborate on&quot;.<br />
<br />
If it's any consolation I'm kind of disappointed by how clockwork gnomes were implemented, but I am not going to exaggerate how much I hate them. Honestly I'm happy gnomes are getting any attention at all...<br />

Glad to see they might do Kul Tiran Mages. And High Elf customization for Void Elves (and Blood Elves, IMO) would be a good thing.<br />
<br />
I am curious what these customizations are. I suspect it's high elf-colored skin and hair, rather than eye colors. Ironically this may lead to people still complaining about them.<br />
<br />
Honestly I'm against blood elves getting blue eyes since it blurs the lines between factions too much. How do Horde tell that an elf is a blood elf if they start having blue eyes? I feel like glowing eyes are kind of the blood elves' thing now, and now that they have an option for yellow eyes I don't think it's necessary any longer (since not all blood elves wanted glowing fel-tainted eyes).<br />

<br />
I'm going to type this slowly so they understand (not that they read these forums but...): I...DO...NOT...WANT...WORLD...PVP. I don't want it. I'm not going to queue up for War Mode, I'm not going to flag for it no matter the rewards. If I want PVP I'll go into a BG. I wish Blizz would stop forcing world PVP on people.<br />
<br />
Back in Classic people would just attack the Crossroads or Org or wherever for reasons (not even achievements) that centered around the fact it was fun. Now? Times have changed and honestly I avoid world PVP like the plague.<br />
<br />
The ONLY exception to this would be if they're offering like a piece of 390 gear for completing a relatively easy incursion where I HAVE to flag for War Mode temporarily to complete the incursion. Then I would treat it like a battleground in my mind. But I sure as heck would turn it off right after.<br />
<br />
Also, even when I do want some world PvP it's almost never fun because there are not huge battles. As an Alliance turning on War Mode mostly means I'll be ganked by roving groups of Horde. If an actual skirmish does happen - it's just a matter of time until one or the other side usually ends it by bringing a huge zerg.<br />
<br />
I don't know why they keep forcing world PvP in a numerically unbalanced (even if it's just 60/40) two-faction MMO where a large portion of players prefer PvE, and many actively dislike PvP. On top of this the sharding/CRZ/LFG systems constantly add and remove huge groups of players to zone instances making it impossible to have any kind of numerical balance.<br />
<br />
War Mode was almost a great solution to world PvP. But so many factors work against it and until they fix these fundamental issues, there will never be active and interesting world PvP.</div></div><hr />

First I've heard of it. And I read here every day dangit!<br />
<br />
Not playing horde I don't know the details here. <br />
But I really hope Blizz pays/paid attention to the debacle that is the SWTOR storyline now because when they gave players free reign to CYOA with some major storyline decisions they then jerked the entire game storyline into simultaneously existing parallel universes that they've yet to align back up (if they ever will maybe they are giving up the whole MMO idea entire). So depending on your class and faction in SWTOR &quot;present time&quot; various leaders are dead/alive/traitor - but that may or may not match up with other classes and factions storyline! Its a giant stupid mess and no one has any idea how.. or if.. these will ever match up again in the game. <br />

It is not...they are religuos and put people into camps. and destroy everything that is not pure and light.....so...that does not ring ANY bells?<br />

<br />
I did elaborate on it for a other person in this thread.<br />
But lets do it for you because you want it.<br />
Void elves: they are to blue. They could have added more color to them or made them less blue. But they are blue on blue...hench smurfs....and bikini armor...have you seen their heritage armor!?!?!!? <br />
<br />
Kul tirans: They are fat...there belly's big, puffy faces, fat necks....so they are fat ( witch is no problem if the rest of the allied races where not silly also). As for the inbred part....look at the leaked &quot;narly&quot; faces they have...they do not seem really bright to me. More like a bunch of ogres.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Nope they can be bad on a design part , but good on a story part. They can be ugly to me and pretty to you. But design wise crap, or great.<br />
<br />
I think void elves, lightforged, kul tirans and mecha gnomes all have pretty bad design choices<br />
<br />
I think Void elves, mecha gnomes, kul tirans look ugly to me.<br />
<br />
Void elves, light forged, kul tirans have poor designed heritage armor.<br />
<br />
And void elves, lightforged, dark iron dwarfs have little to no story, hero's or ANYTHING ingame.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And in most of these cases, you did not provide what you think could have been done instead, or provided very vague examples (What is a mad-max gnome? Sounds cool, but what even is that?), leading one to believe that you are complaining merely for the sake of complaining rather than trying to provide an opinion that could be utilized to improve any of these races.<br />
<br />
Why i did not do that?!?! simple because i know people on this forum...they want a 10 page reaction. and if you miss type 1 lettter...they make 20 post about it.<br />
But okay if you want it:<br />
<br />
Void elves: Way less blue, way more normal blood elf color in their body. Their heritage armor should cover more instead of being armor for 12 year olds. And storywise they where thrown out of the blood elves extremly fast. and that is it.. and in argus you have a whole zone of void touched stuff...so would not even call it a race.<br />
<br />
Lightforged: should have been broken. But if you keep them like this...Make the armor way more detialed plain. Again we have a human that is lightforged etc...so i would not call it a race. No story behind them also. this should have been a option for normal dreanei players ( like golden blood elf eyes)<br />
<br />
Dark iron dwarfs: need more hero's/story.<br />
<br />
Kul tirans: More body type options. Heritage armor started out cool. But they are adding to much crap to it. And some of it is 3d and some of it is 2d so that classes a lot. Their druid forms should have been normal animals of the area. ( not wicker in my opinion). And if you have them as wicker they could have had more....new models.<br />
Cat could have been a wolf like form seeing as they come from gilnean people ( kul tirans). Flight could have been raven/crow like seeing the wicker theme. Stage ( 1 of the few cool ones) could have been a other animale like that wicker hound. etc etc.<br />
Also the fact that they use 1 texture on ALL forms... is lazy if you see that the counter species ( zandalari) get all new models and each model gets its own texture.<br />
<br />
And the texture is bad. It starts out with a very detailed busy head...then it goes into some weird leaves. The rest of the body is really bland and it ends up with see through legs.<br />
So to be clear a models contains very busy head, bland body, light/see through legs. They could have countered this by making the whole body like a cross between the legs and the heads. <br />
<br />
Mecha gnomes: should have been full on robots, mad max style, cyberpunk style. And nope i do not think they can be fixxed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In short, if you want to be taken seriously, don't be petty. That's really what it comes down to.<br />
<br />
I am not petty. see all the text above with details why.<br />
And you are the one replying to me...you did not have to....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If it's any consolation I'm kind of disappointed by how clockwork gnomes were implemented, but I am not going to exaggerate how much I hate them. Honestly I'm happy gnomes are getting any attention at all...<br />
Now take that feeling and smear it out over all classes, then add not story for the alliance , then add not mounts for us etc etc etc</div></div><hr />

Still, the only horde race interesting enough is blood elves. And it's not like the horde disagree, 15% or the player base are blood elves, as many as alliance has humans,it's by far the most popular race, with such margin compared to alliance side. Who got both looks and lore behind it.<br />
<br />
Obviously matter of opinions, but the baseline races have the lore but not the looks, they never had the looks, revamp or not, hate me for it or not, it's just my opinion.<br />
And like the alliance allied races currently theirs too are reskins of existing ones, Nightborne being probably the most distinctive ones, but essentially still elves as emo as the void ones in looks.<br />
They just stuffed their holes full of ancient mana instead of void.<br />
<br />
Highmountain tauren.. tauren.. what's the difference, absolutely nothing. Much like dark irons mag'hars are just different color.<br />
Although dark irons have been in the game since vanilla and they've actually have a story behind them i'd argue they have the most story out of all the allied races, it's just a matter of how much wow and the lore the player is aware of, but several zones worth of it. It's really the part of how and why they would join Alliance at this point, that could have used a longer take on it, although since Magni was turned in to a diamond and her daughter brought to the throne, i guess that's supposed to be why.<br />
Mag'har orcs have also a similar longer story behind them that's known in the lore and learned via Outland at first place.<br />
<br />
Void elves didn't have as strong introduction as highborne, no where near as close. <br />
So there's one claim to say horde got something, but on the other hand it's still a bit shady why they chose how they chose.. It felt like someone somewhere rolled a die and horde got them and the void was filled on the other side.<br />
<br />
Highmountain had one zone behind them, but when you think about it the lightforged were involved with the paladins, the priests and Argus.<br />
But still both had as much customization as the other one when compared to the originals.<br />
<br />
By the looks of it, the dark iron introduction quests as well the mag'har ones at least have openings for the future.<br />
<br />
Then we have kul'tirans and zandalar. Again existing races with new customization. <br />
Where the only distinction to me is the druid forms, but that's purely a matter of opinion. Dinos are cool and all, but i mean, we've seem them forever.<br />
And for me Drustvar was the best most interesting zone in the expansion so it's not hard to figure which way i lean.<br />
The humans are detailed yes, but my kul'tiran was always going to be a druid so, the base model matters little.<br />
And trolls are pretty much cool when they are in a troll themed raid.<br />
<br />
For the future we need something new and not just new custom looks for existing ones.<br />
Gnomes are coming it seems, so same thing as these others.<br />
Possible high elf option for void elves would make me level my void elf up much faster, but it's still elves..<br />
There were also mention of goblins related to Mechagon, so Horde getting their equivalent of mechagnomes?<br />
Or is that the Nazjatar gilgoblins? another &quot;reskin&quot;..<br />
Undead don't have one yet, but i don't even know what that would be, hopefully nothing..<br />
Or worgen, samething, don't need worgen with horns or something, they are cool as they are.<br />
<br />
New things that are on and about, sethrakk, the nazjatar fish dudes (looked like jinyu), vulpera, broken (it's just more draeneis), then we have the crazy theories, naga, murlocs, vrykul, furbolgs, tortollan, tuskar. It's go and pick, i'm sure everyone wants different one of those.. But when it's up to me, vulpera and max jinyu. There's those others that definitely have the story behind them, but i don't want to see tuskar or tortollans, or furbolgs or sethrakk for that matter stuffed in to on old vanilla armor, when pandas are on the very border line of making them work, hrrr. They would have to redo the entire armor system and update all the old models and meshes, that is not from the stone age, which again is something i'd prefer, but it's something that should come before more allied races and probably be the amount of work that we'd skip the next expac, so i don't think it's happening. The jinyu was almost confirmed as much as the mechagnomes, though i don't care for either. Vulpera, will be at some point, but horde. Well it's the second reason after blood elves to play horde, still hoping they are the new pandas, though it's just a smaller worgen really which i already play, especially after the new worgen models, the difference is the size. So you got large dogs and small dogs. Where's the wolves at? Oh right even the new shaman ghost wolf is a ghost dog. Wolves be extinct. Well at least the eyes look normal.<br />
<br />
There's a lot in that list, but only few that would work with current models and meshes and actually look decent. I'm sure fun would be most of them, ridiculous to be exact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New races for the Alliance has always been an issue, even since Vanilla. The only two most people could realistically speculate about were the potential for Gilnean worgen, and that didn't happen until Cataclysm, and the original Draenei (i.e. WCIII), and they were changed quite drastically, both lore-wise and in terms of their design. And no, furbolgs were never realistically in the running, despite how often they come up.<br />
<br />
Case in point, unless Blizzard is spinning yarn whole cloth from their asses (Draenei, Void Elves) or relying on slight alterations (Lightforged, Dark Iron), then they really don't have much to pull from for new Alliance races, and that's always been the case.</div></div><hr />

Dark Iron dwarves have literally been playable since Cataclysm, yeah. Blizzard added a bunch of ashen skin tones to dwarves in that expansion to facilitate their joining the Council of Three Hammers. Heck, lore-wise, when you play a dwarf mage or warlock, you're straight up playing a Dark Iron dwarf. I always thought it was rather odd that Blizzard forgot about all this when the idea of Dark Irons being an allied race was going around. Then again, it's more likely that they simply didn't care.</div></div><hr />

Not that I believe they won't be, since it fits nicely with the &quot;making sense&quot; argument, but nothing more than that. After Blizzcon my opinion has changed from no way to yeah, maybe. But don't be to sure. Just look at Vulpera. Chances for them to be Allied race is rather slim now. Since after 8.1 we are moving away from Zuldazar and Kul Tiras for new zones. And so many people were 100% sure Vulpera would become an Allied race. It seems Zandalari Trolls and Kul Tiran will be the only ones from the two current zones. <br />
<br />
I have to mention though, that Goblins and Gnomes are getting lots of attention now in 8.1 and 8.2. The interactions between Gallywix and Mekkatorque is hilarious. Mechagnome and Giblins as next Allied Races? Horde-players will be accompanied with Giblins and others in Naj'atar.<br />

They can't give us anything that would VEs be recognizable as HEs. If anything that's just a way of telling the player base that they are going to give BEs the &quot;missing&quot; eye color and VEs as well. After all you are playing a HE (BE) that was outcast and tainted by the void. You won't look like one but the horde is there for you if you want to be closer to what HEs should look like. Not that BEs would actually be HEs, even with the missing eye color, but you can't conjure up out of thin air! There are far to few HEs to make them into an allied race. I mean a handful of BEs getting outcast is enough but HEs? Nah, can't do that!</div></div><hr />

How do Horde tell that an elf is a blood elf if they start having blue eyes? I feel like glowing eyes are kind of the blood elves' thing now, and now that they have an option for yellow eyes I don't think it's necessary any longer (since not all blood elves wanted glowing fel-tainted eyes).<br />
<br />
PS: It might be time to change your title. Just sayin'. :p<br />

<br />
100% agree, I have no issue with High Elves basically being made playable via Void Elf customization options hell given them Paladins even for that but Blood Elves should NEVER be able to have High Elf eyes and what not, it breaks the barrier between them completely. Yeah some can have golden eyes now because of the Sunwells new Lightbased source that's fine but other than that no, the Blood Elves Fel Green Eyes are meant to last for generations and that should be kept. It'd be silly if we got all this stuff about how High Elves are welcome to the Sunwell sometimes sure but not much else annnd it was all thrown away, especially with Alleria and what she's done to herself casuing even more rifts between Quel'Thalas and the Quel'Thasian remenants that remain in the Alliance.</div></div><hr />

The class abilities and rewards are crippled unless you turn it on. Forced? perhaps not. But definitely coerced. Still a flawed decision on their part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing I have a problem with, certainly not enough to post slurs such as comparing them to real life genocidal groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is not...they are religuos and put people into camps. and destroy everything that is not pure and light.....so...that does not ring ANY bells?<br />
<br />
Last I checked the lightforged draenei aren't executing their victims or exterminating all non-draenei. Where you are even remotely getting the connection from is a mystery to me, just seems like it was the quickest insult that you could come up with. That you're actually bold enough to defend this amazes me. And not even remotely in a good way. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
I did elaborate on it for a other person in this thread.<br />
<br />
Gonna stop you here. I have no intention on scouring the post for your threads. You're original post should have done so given how much time and effort you spent on whining and throwing petty (and highly inaccurate in most cases) insults towards these races.<br />
<br />
<br />
But lets do it for you because you want it.<br />
<br />
Trust me, I don't. It was advice for you, this isn't for my enjoyment.<br />
<br />
<br />
Void elves: they are to blue. They could have added more color to them or made them less blue. But they are blue on blue...hench smurfs....and bikini armor...have you seen their heritage armor!?!?!!? <br />
<br />
Added more color to them... made them less blue... HMMM... that almost sounds like high elves. How curious, a total coincidence, I am certain. I guess flat out saying &quot;void elves weren't high elves&quot; would have gotten you negative reactions, but then again, this post does too. So why even beat around the bush when you're going to post a thread this blatant in the first place? :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
And really, your only issue with them is that they are blue? You must really hate draenei, trolls, and night elves. The complaint about their heritage armor is even more ridiculous. Most players don't have it to use, nor choose to do so if they do. If you want to make a thread about heritage armor that's fine, but judging a race by their optional heritage armor? That's really grasping at straws.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kul tirans: They are fat...there belly's big, puffy faces, fat necks....so they are fat ( witch is no problem if the rest of the allied races where not silly also). As for the inbred part....look at the leaked &quot;narly&quot; faces they have...they do not seem really bright to me. More like a bunch of ogres.<br />
<br />
Sure, they are fat. You can call them that if you want to, because it's not a stretch. But calling them inbred? That's just childish on your part. You are really digging for insults on that one. Instead of expressing how much you hate them, you should express what you'd like to see different. For instance, &quot;I'd prefer them to have more muscle and less fat&quot; would be more useful than &quot;OMG THEY ARE FAT AND LOOK &quot;INBRED&quot;!!!!!11!111&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope they can be bad on a design part , but good on a story part. They can be ugly to me and pretty to you. But design wise crap, or great.<br />
<br />
That's great except that Dark Iron have played a major role in the story for years and people have been begging for them since Cataclysm. &quot;They don't fit well in the story&quot; makes about as much sense as saying &quot;humans don't fit well in the story&quot;. lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think void elves, lightforged, kul tirans and mecha gnomes all have pretty bad design choices<br />
<br />
I think Void elves, mecha gnomes, kul tirans look ugly to me.<br />
<br />
k<br />
<br />
<br />
Void elves, light forged, kul tirans have poor designed heritage armor.<br />
<br />
Did you really just call the lightforged and the KUL TIRAN WASTECOATS as being 'poorly designed'? Wow... you are grasping way too far.<br />
<br />
Let alone the fact you are judging a race by their 'heritage armor' to begin with, but I mean Kul Tirans have 99 problems... their heritage armor, which is likely the best heritage armor in the game, is not one of them. I am going to assume you're just looking for things to complain about and don't actually hate their armor out of respect for you. You can find it not to your taste but how could anyone really call that poorly designed? Just.. wow.<br />
<br />
If you think it can be improved or adjusted, that's one thing, but going full on black and white about this and suggesting its 'poorly designed' because it's slightly different from what you wanted? That's ... impressive.<br />
<br />
<br />
And void elves, lightforged, dark iron dwarfs have little to no story, hero's or ANYTHING ingame.<br />
<br />
Uh... the lightforged have a ton of heroes encountered on Argus, void elves actually develop their lore heavily on the war campaign (you can interact with Umbric for quite a bit of lore), and...<br />
<br />
...did you really just say &quot;Dark iron dwarves have little to no story&quot;? Is this serious? Are we playing the same game? Dark Iron have played significant, if not major roles (and on the side of the Alliance, no less) in virtually every expansion since Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
There are a ton of named Dark Iron heroes as well, far more than most allied races, more than some of the regular races, even. I suggest stopping while you're ahead. You are not going to be able to argue that &quot;dark iron lack heroes/story&quot;, and saying that this is a poorly designed race is just going to make you enemies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why i did not do that?!?! simple because i know people on this forum...they want a 10 page reaction. and if you miss type 1 lettter...they make 20 post about it.<br />
But okay if you want it:<br />
<br />
That's an extremely lame excuse to not post your opinion on what could be improved, or at least be elaborate what's wrong with them than &quot;omg they nazi&quot; or &quot;omg they inbred&quot; or &quot;omg they smurf&quot;. Quit wasting time on petty complaints that helps no one, and spend more time detailing your issues with them. If they are simple as &quot;I wanted a different race&quot;, and you think that might get results you dislike... maybe you should think about that, accept that, and not post about it to begin with. Just a thought.<br />
<br />
<br />
Void elves: Way less blue, way more normal blood elf color in their body. Their heritage armor should cover more instead of being armor for 12 year olds. And storywise they where thrown out of the blood elves extremly fast. and that is it.. and in argus you have a whole zone of void touched stuff...so would not even call it a race.<br />
<br />
Obsession over their blue skin color, obsession over their heritage armor that you can opt not to use. Refer back to my post about their skin not being blue... this is a pretty veiled way of saying &quot;I wanted high elves&quot;. Just be honest about it instead of trying to call them smurfs. Yeah, people will bash you for it, and you'll probably have it coming for being so petty. But it's better than this, and it's at least being honest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lightforged: should have been broken. But if you keep them like this...Make the armor way more detialed plain. Again we have a human that is lightforged etc...so i would not call it a race. No story behind them also. this should have been a option for normal dreanei players ( like golden blood elf eyes)<br />
<br />
You literally came up with no actual reasons why you dislike lightforged draenei and went so far as to say you like the options and that they should be available for normal draenei.<br />
<br />
Thank you for at least coming up with the real reason you dislike lightforged draenei--they aren't broken. From the looks of things you don't have any real problems with lightforged, you just mistakenly believe they are taking the place of a different race you prefer. This is 100% false; the broken were never going to happen. You should accept that lightforged draenei are here to stay and perhaps even play one, as you seem to like their customization to some extent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dark iron dwarfs: need more hero's/story.<br />
<br />
lol<br />
<br />
Refer to above post, Dark iron have a ton of story and plenty of notable heroes. This feels like an excuse, because it probably is one. Out of all the allied races you could bash as being lazy, poorly designed or having a weak backstory, dark iron are basically the weakest possible option you could pick, even compared to the Zandalari. I strongly suggest you give this battle up, because it is not one you will ever be able to win.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kul tirans: More body type options. Heritage armor started out cool. But they are adding to much crap to it. And some of it is 3d and some of it is 2d so that classes a lot. <br />
<br />
And we come to the real issue you have with Kul Tirans. &quot;I don't want to play as a fat character.&quot; okay. <br />
<br />
Why not just suggest that you want a more muscled human? Or do you just want skinny kul tirans, those weird shriveled male-only characters that do virtually nothing and are almost entirely irrelevant to the story in any way? If so, at least state it to begin with. Calling kul tirans &quot;fat and inbred&quot; because you dislike the body type is incredibly petty.<br />
<br />
Even here you recognize that the heritage armor looks great. Yeah, a lot of people preferred the simpler style before, but the heritage armor hardly looks 'bad' now. Unlike changing the race, commenting on their heritage armor is something that could still get changed by Blizzard. But not if you're just making wild complaints on MMO-champ.<br />
<br />
<br />
Their druid forms should have been normal animals of the area. ( not wicker in my opinion). And if you have them as wicker they could have had more....new models.<br />
Cat could have been a wolf like form seeing as they come from gilnean people ( kul tirans). Flight could have been raven/crow like seeing the wicker theme. Stage ( 1 of the few cool ones) could have been a other animale like that wicker hound. etc etc.<br />
Also the fact that they use 1 texture on ALL forms... is lazy if you see that the counter species ( zandalari) get all new models and each model gets its own texture.<br />
And the texture is bad. It starts out with a very detailed busy head...then it goes into some weird leaves. The rest of the body is really bland and it ends up with see through legs.<br />
So to be clear a models contains very busy head, bland body, light/see through legs. They could have countered this by making the whole body like a cross between the legs and the heads. <br />
<br />
Zandalari have the best druid forms hands down, but I am confused why you are saying the 'cat form should have been a wolf'. Even the zandalari dinosaur forms are still similar to bears and cats. They don't have a raptor form for their cat, it uses the same animations.<br />
<br />
Fortunately you are not forced to use wicker forms if you don't prefer them. Kul tiran druids have replacements for literally every single form if you would prefer different ones. You can have an artifact form bear and cat (to be fair, only for guardian and feral), a dolphin/orca, a sentinel owl/class order hall flight form, and a fawn/cheetah travel form.<br />
<br />
That's not to say your complaint about wicker forms is invalid -- that is to say, it's okay to dislike them -- but suggesting they be changed or that 'they all use the same form', is wrong and frankly, kind of selfish given how popular they are. But let's not focus too much on personal preferences here; the wicker druid forms are extremely popular and a selling point for the entire race so I think you're going to be alone on wishing they could be different, especially when options to change them are readily available.<br />
<br />
It's worth mentioning that the one form you didn't mention is actually one that the playerbase largely agrees on looking bad -- the moonkin form. If you want to complain about Kul Tiran druid forms looking bad, stick with that one. You'll find people agreeing on that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mecha gnomes: should have been full on robots, mad max style, cyberpunk style. And nope i do not think they can be fixxed.<br />
<br />
I disagree that they can't be fixed, but I actually agree with making them full-on robots. Should have posted about that instead of complaining about their looks in an incredibly vague way.<br />
<br />
They are early enough in the concept stage that if players voice their opinions about them strongly enough, we could see changes before they launch. And I intend to do so, for that matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not petty. see all the text above with details why.<br />
And you are the one replying to me...you did not have to....<br />
<br />
Don't worry, the odds of me replying to you again are pretty low. I think we covered all points, and I don't really like drawn out threads like this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now take that feeling and smear it out over all classes, then add not story for the alliance , then add not mounts for us etc etc etc<br />
<br />
Alliance story with some major exceptions (All of Darkshore, most of the 8.0 war campaign, etc) has been well above average right now, even in comparison to the Horde story. I don't feel bad about it. But honestly, I am not curious enough to ask you why you feel that way.<br />
<br />
PS: You might be pleased to know that void elves are getting options to appear more 'high elven', though at the same time, who knows. They'd still be labeled void elves and have 'bikini heritage armor', so maybe you'll still find things to dislike about them. I imagine this should satisfy you mostly, at least.<br />
<br />
Most likely this will be my last response here, think about what I am saying if you want to make a thread that has a good shot of people agreeing with you or taking your points into consideration, or even presenting any people can use to begin with.<br />

A quick meme about taking off shoulders for Saurfang is enough to spur large changes to lore, and give Horde players the agency to diverge from the original route. But months of passionate pleas for the High Elf movement and Night Elf fans that are tired of being punching bags, only give a few begrudging responses that MIGHT deliver they tiniest of changes.<br />
<br />
It's a massive victory, and the fact you are treating it is a minor one probably implies that they shouldn't have bothered in the first place. The high elf fanatics are never going to be satisfied. Even if high elves were released, you'd complain that they are too hard to unlock or whatnot. <br />
<br />
Be grateful that they listened to the pleas and are giving you options to truly feel like a high elf.<br />
<br />

<br />
Honestly I don't think void elves should have default high elf eyes either, just high elf skin and high elf hair. They aren't high elves, and they aren't blood elves, they are void elves. That's not to say that I would be upset if they had said standard high elf blue eyes, but I don't see the need for it. But that's just my biased opinion. Even if Blizzard does this and makes them identical to high elves, the worst high elf fanatics will still complain that they aren't literally called 'high elves' with special (boring) high elf racials. I support the options but I wonder if it will even make a difference in how many people are whining about void elves?<br />
<br />
Ah, but I digress. Naturally I agree with the bit about blood elves in your post though, of course. And my point about high elf eyes being incredibly weird on blood elves I think has already been well covered! :p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baskev</div><div class="date">2018-11-07, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">New races for the Alliance has always been an issue, even since Vanilla. The only two most people could realistically speculate about were the potential for Gilnean worgen, and that didn't happen until Cataclysm, and the original Draenei (i.e. WCIII), and they were changed quite drastically, both lore-wise and in terms of their design. And no, furbolgs were never realistically in the running, despite how often they come up.<br />
<br />
Case in point, unless Blizzard is spinning yarn whole cloth from their asses (Draenei, Void Elves) or relying on slight alterations (Lightforged, Dark Iron), then they really don't have much to pull from for new Alliance races, and that's always been the case.<br />

<br />
..........so you think i post a slur because i did not get my candy....nope and this what your intention is.<br />
These are 2 different things. I hate how little attention we are getting.<br />
But lightforged are what they are. Blizzard writes the story that in AU dreanor they act like a bunch of nazi. I do not call them that because i did not get my candy.<br />
<br />
And this way i do not try to make these 10 page posts. Because people like you want to win something so connect 2 things that are not connected in the least just to win a argument. <br />

No...they are just trying to force people into being one of them ...cough...illidan...cough.<br />
Again...blizzard is trying to connect the dots for us that the light is not pure with AU lightforged and what happens on Argus with illidan.<br />
And no its the best fitting. They are written as a group of religous mad men that force conversion of put you into to camps ( this is in the new lore btw)...i could thing of other names...but those are worse.<br />

As for whining , you are the one doing it. You can not take that i have a different opinion as you.<br />

Nope. They could have different skin colors as night elves do.....You clearly have a thing for making me into a person that i am not. I would say yes...in a perfect world i want high elves. But NO i do not expect them to be a real thing ever because it would brake the immersion between the 2 factions with to much of the same type of elves. So nope.<br />
So to be clear nope i do not expect normal skin colors. They could still be blue. But like night elves a bit more variation would have broken up the ....blue man group look of them.<br />

Yes, my only issue that they are blue. And we already have 2 species like that on the alliance site....3 if you count lightforged.<br />
I know you do not have to use it. But it shows how much work and thought has been put into the armors. Lore wise they also make less sense.<br />
<br />
And this clearly shows that you do not understand that my main problem is not that 1 thing is bad about them...i could deal with some less detailed work. My problem is that for the alliance...pretty much every race, mount etc has this problem.<br />
Its a sum of a lot of broken parts i am not so happy with.<br />
Per example: people dislike islands and azurite armor. Does 1 of them alone ( if the rest was great) make it a bad start for a expansion...or does it all in 1 make it a bad start for a expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, they are fat. You can call them that if you want to, because it's not a stretch. But calling them inbred? That's just childish on your part. You are really digging for insults on that one. Instead of expressing how much you hate them, you should express what you'd like to see different. For instance, &quot;I'd prefer them to have more muscle and less fat&quot; would be more useful than &quot;OMG THEY ARE FAT AND LOOK &quot;INBRED&quot;!!!!!11!111&quot;<br />
<br />
Agian its not...and who is insulting now...you say my names for them are insulting...yet you insult me pretty much every god damm paragraph...<br />
And again i have given you a reason why i think it. They have faces that look very...lets say..simpleton. <br />
<br />
And why i did not type more muscle and less fat...then you and people like you would say: you hate fat people. etc etc. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's great except that Dark Iron have played a major role in the story for years and people have been begging for them since Cataclysm. &quot;They don't fit well in the story&quot; makes about as much sense as saying &quot;humans don't fit well in the story&quot;. lol.<br />
<br />
They did the same about naga , real mecha gnomes etc....<br />
And part of the story...there normal dwarf queen play's a role. Or did i miss all the named hero's , all the dark iron dwarfs in the quests. <br />
They where a part of vanilla lore and then they came back as bad guys. With little to no story.<br />
The story the have is attacking brewfest and there normal dwarf queen rejoining the dwarf kingdom. No big lore like highmountian, nightborn etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
k<br />
<br />
Yup <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you really just call the lightforged and the KUL TIRAN WASTECOATS as being 'poorly designed'? Wow... you are grasping way too far.<br />
<br />
Let alone the fact you are judging a race by their 'heritage armor' to begin with, but I mean Kul Tirans have 99 problems... their heritage armor, which is likely the best heritage armor in the game, is not one of them. I am going to assume you're just looking for things to complain about and don't actually hate their armor out of respect for you. You can find it not to your taste but how could anyone really call that poorly designed? Just.. wow.<br />
<br />
If you think it can be improved or adjusted, that's one thing, but going full on black and white about this and suggesting its 'poorly designed' because it's slightly different from what you wanted? That's ... impressive.<br />
<br />
No i am not. Look at the armors. Horde ones have griebeling and the small parts like feather are 3d. Kul tirans have a coat where you have 3 belts that are 3d...and then poorly 2d button thingies. it clashes like hell.<br />
<br />
And again...its a sum of the parts...if it was just the armor that was bad...okay...but it is not just the armor.<br />
The shouldesr that float, the 3/4 pants they have. Barrels as wrists? they have 3d things on 2de things witch make it clash like hell. <br />
And the first itteration ( witch was more 2d) was better. They keep adding stuff to it that makes it clash more and more.<br />
Its not because it is different. Its because of the choices that are made...3/4 pants, weird shoulders that also float, barrels that somehow stay fixxed to your arms ...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Uh... the lightforged have a ton of heroes encountered on Argus, void elves actually develop their lore heavily on the war campaign (you can interact with Umbric for quite a bit of lore), and...<br />
<br />
...did you really just say &quot;Dark iron dwarves have little to no story&quot;? Is this serious? Are we playing the same game? Dark Iron have played significant, if not major roles (and on the side of the Alliance, no less) in virtually every expansion since Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
There are a ton of named Dark Iron heroes as well, far more than most allied races, more than some of the regular races, even. I suggest stopping while you're ahead. You are not going to be able to argue that &quot;dark iron lack heroes/story&quot;, and saying that this is a poorly designed race is just going to make you enemies.<br />
<br />
lightforged: a couple of quests on argus does not count as massive lore. Not if you put it next to ...lets say high mountain.<br />
<br />
Void elves: a quests where he gives you stealth to kill some people is not lore about void elves etc.<br />
<br />
As for dark iron: I said it before...most of the lore has been about their queen...a normal dwarf. Please link me half a dozen dark iron dwarfs that have quest lore and massive story's about dark iron lore....please do..so i can play those quests and maybe say yes...you are right...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's an extremely lame excuse to not post your opinion on what could be improved, or at least be elaborate what's wrong with them than &quot;omg they nazi&quot; or &quot;omg they inbred&quot; or &quot;omg they smurf&quot;. Quit wasting time on petty complaints that helps no one, and spend more time detailing your issues with them. If they are simple as &quot;I wanted a different race&quot;, and you think that might get results you dislike... maybe you should think about that, accept that, and not post about it to begin with. Just a thought.<br />
<br />
That is not a excuse...look at what you are doing here:<br />
- insulting me<br />
- making connections between things that are not connected<br />
- not countering my points but just say: you are wrong...( with no evidence at all) <br />
etc<br />
And i detailed the issue's on them in short to a other person in this thread. You do not have to read...all 3 pages for it....yet you act like you need to read the whole forum for it.<br />
And i should not post things i dislike on the game because i might get a response from people like you?!?! so i should be silent and never voice a opinion because your word is god?!?!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Obsession over their blue skin color, obsession over their heritage armor that you can opt not to use. Refer back to my post about their skin not being blue... this is a pretty veiled way of saying &quot;I wanted high elves&quot;. Just be honest about it instead of trying to call them smurfs. Yeah, people will bash you for it, and you'll probably have it coming for being so petty. But it's better than this, and it's at least being honest.<br />
<br />
Nope it is not. I have said it before...they are just blue on blue...could also call them blue man group, andorians ( witch makes more sense because of their tentecals on their head ).<br />
Again with the name calling...do i call you petty or stupid?!?! nope...so please behave.<br />
<br />
And again...man feel like a broken record..its not that they are blue...lets say we gotten the broken that we wanted ( just like horde gotten their upright everything and multi raced orcs etc)..then people like me would voice their opinion less. Its the whole sum that makes us mad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You literally came up with no actual reasons why you dislike lightforged draenei and went so far as to say you like the options and that they should be available for normal draenei.<br />
<br />
Thank you for at least coming up with the real reason you dislike lightforged draenei--they aren't broken. From the looks of things you don't have any real problems with lightforged, you just mistakenly believe they are taking the place of a different race you prefer. This is 100% false; the broken were never going to happen. You should accept that lightforged draenei are here to stay and perhaps even play one, as you seem to like their customization to some extent.<br />
<br />
....simple ...maybe because i think their are certain slur you have a problem with......<br />
as for option for normal dreanei...this way you would not offend the fanboys who liked them.<br />
<br />
Yes i like the customization...one of the few things ( except for dark irons) that was done nicely. And yes i know we will never get broken. But i still can voice my opinion...you seem to think that i want all my wishes to come true and that i am the voice of god.<br />
No i do not think that or want that. <br />
I just want the next allied race not to be like the previous alliance ones...a sum of bad parts and choices put into a bad body. That is why i am still hoping for something cool for gnomes allied race.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
lol<br />
<br />
Refer to above post, Dark iron have a ton of story and plenty of notable heroes. This feels like an excuse, because it probably is one. Out of all the allied races you could bash as being lazy, poorly designed or having a weak backstory, dark iron are basically the weakest possible option you could pick, even compared to the Zandalari. I strongly suggest you give this battle up, because it is not one you will ever be able to win.<br />
<br />
Again...link me the proof. proof me wrong.<br />
What back story?!?!?! there is little to it. so like me wowhead/wowpedia stuff about it.<br />
zandalari have old world lore and many bosses in dungeons. They also have parts of zones they where in . think pandaria. <br />
And they have a whole city now...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And we come to the real issue you have with Kul Tirans. &quot;I don't want to play as a fat character.&quot; okay. <br />
<br />
Why not just suggest that you want a more muscled human? Or do you just want skinny kul tirans, those weird shriveled male-only characters that do virtually nothing and are almost entirely irrelevant to the story in any way? If so, at least state it to begin with. Calling kul tirans &quot;fat and inbred&quot; because you dislike the body type is incredibly petty.<br />
<br />
Even here you recognize that the heritage armor looks great. Yeah, a lot of people preferred the simpler style before, but the heritage armor hardly looks 'bad' now. Unlike changing the race, commenting on their heritage armor is something that could still get changed by Blizzard. But not if you're just making wild complaints on MMO-champ.<br />
<br />
I would not mind a fat one....But again...it is the sum of the parts!<br />
<br />
No, i would like to have seen skinny ( like forsaken model ones), normal ones ( like proudmoore's), and fat ones like cyrus. So we have choices...like the orcs got with their different races and choice to stand up or hunch over. It would have also expanded them greatly and made them a real...rpg choice to play.<br />
<br />
First off i have already said what i disliked about the armor. <br />
Secondly yes they could change it. But every change they made so far has been for the worse.<br />
And again...i should not comment on things i dislike . Because you want to fill your mmo- champion forums. Where you are the boss of with comments that only alligne with your opinion?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zandalari have the best druid forms hands down, but I am confused why you are saying the 'cat form should have been a wolf'. Even the zandalari dinosaur forms are still similar to bears and cats. They don't have a raptor form for their cat, it uses the same animations.<br />
<br />
Fortunately you are not forced to use wicker forms if you don't prefer them. Kul tiran druids have replacements for literally every single form if you would prefer different ones. You can have an artifact form bear and cat (to be fair, only for guardian and feral), a dolphin/orca, a sentinel owl/class order hall flight form, and a fawn/cheetah travel form.<br />
<br />
That's not to say your complaint about wicker forms is invalid -- that is to say, it's okay to dislike them -- but suggesting they be changed or that 'they all use the same form', is wrong and frankly, kind of selfish given how popular they are. But let's not focus too much on personal preferences here; the wicker druid forms are extremely popular and a selling point for the entire race so I think you're going to be alone on wishing they could be different, especially when options to change them are readily available.<br />
<br />
It's worth mentioning that the one form you didn't mention is actually one that the playerbase largely agrees on looking bad -- the moonkin form. If you want to complain about Kul Tiran druid forms looking bad, stick with that one. You'll find people agreeing on that.<br />
<br />
Looks wise they could have made it into a wolf. Seeing as kul tirans are former gilneans. Still have the same body type. Would not have been that much trouble seeing as they have countless of wolf models ingame.<br />
<br />
Yes i could replace them...but why should i play them if i thing all the forms are bad choices!??! or ugly for me?!?! That beats the point fo allied races in a whole.<br />
<br />
They use the same MODEL ( so wireframe model and base build) . You are confusing 2 things here. The theme i think could have been executed better. I think they are poorly chosen ( how the texture aka the skin of them is made). The models are the same base druid models night elves and worgen druids have. <br />
And i am not alone. There are other peope who dislike them. But again..its a opinion i have. And no , i do not expect them to change it. But that does not mean i can not say they are ugly. And last time i checked there was this guy called therealbowser that said to me...i need to be more clear in my answers....and now you are saying i am to clear about it?<br />
And yes options are available but again...why play a allied race then?!?<br />
<br />
And nope i did not mention it because everyone things it is bad. And you would most likely say: Yeah...but its just because you dislike the moonkin form etc etc<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree that they can't be fixed, but I actually agree with making them full-on robots. Should have posted about that instead of complaining about their looks in an incredibly vague way.<br />
<br />
They are early enough in the concept stage that if players voice their opinions about them strongly enough, we could see changes before they launch. And I intend to do so, for that matter.<br />
<br />
Again....i can voice my opinion how i like. <br />
And humor way is the only way to look positive about them. <br />
<br />
Yeah...and that works....4 expansions long alliance players gave feedback on bad racials....80% of raiders are not horde. Many MANY people complained about several launch mistakes in ALPHA and BETA of BFA...and they fixxed nothing. There is still the same buggy world &quot;crack&quot; that makes you dc that i have reported on dozen times now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't worry, the odds of me replying to you again are pretty low. I think we covered all points, and I don't really like drawn out threads like this.<br />
<br />
Then why ask for more clear answers?!?!?!<br />
You clearly wanted to &quot;win&quot; this argument. You call my points weak but do not counter them. You call me names ( i could report you for that but i will not) and you link 2 things that are completly different as 1 thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Alliance story with some major exceptions (All of Darkshore, most of the 8.0 war campaign, etc) has been well above average right now, even in comparison to the Horde story. I don't feel bad about it. But honestly, I am not curious enough to ask you why you feel that way.<br />
<br />
PS: You might be pleased to know that void elves are getting options to appear more 'high elven', though at the same time, who knows. They'd still be labeled void elves and have 'bikini heritage armor', so maybe you'll still find things to dislike about them. I imagine this should satisfy you mostly, at least.<br />
<br />
Most likely this will be my last response here, think about what I am saying if you want to make a thread that has a good shot of people agreeing with you or taking your points into consideration, or even presenting any people can use to begin with.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lol you say i do not want to ask why i think it...then say&gt;&gt;&gt; all of darkshore and most of the 8.0 war campaign.......dude that is half the story of so far...holy crap..<br />
<br />
Nope again you think i am a silly person, i am not. If your options for more different void elves are true i am happy. And they can join dark irons in the...good enough box atleast. ( maybe more if the story is better). <br />
<br />
There have been threads of people like me who agree with people like me.<br />
And lets be clear.<br />
<br />
I do not think all of it is bad. If the other things where great. But in my OPINION its a sum of parts thing. And the sum is very broken.<br />
And tip for you next time....do not call people silly, stupid etc...that is not nice and only proves you are being a bad person.</div></div><hr />
