Battle for Azeroth brings a new Island Expeditions feature. Taking what the team liked from Mists of Pandaria's scenarios and stepping it up, these expeditions take a team of three players to uncharted islands across the Great sea in search of Azerite. Each island is randomly generated and so there is always something unique and new to find. Also, the enemy AI does not behave like normal scripted creature AI. Instead, you face an opposing team that will fight in a much more unpredictable way. Island Expeditions are also role agnostic, meaning that they do not require a Tank, Healer and DPS in order to succeed.<br />

<br />
A new Battle for Azeroth feature, Island Expeditions, is now available for testing for characters at level 110 or higher. Your level and item level will be automatically adjusted to level 120 values.<br />
<br />
Alliance players can queue from the Expedition table in Boralus Harbor, near the Tradewinds Market. Look for the green ship occupying the second slip. <br />
<br />
Horde players can queue from the Expedition table in Zuldazar Harbor, at the Port of Zandalar, on the west side. Look for the red ship.<br />
<br />
What are we testing?<br />
We are currently testing Un’gol Ruins on Normal difficulty.<br />
There are 12 NPC teams available for testing (6 per faction).<br />
<br />
What is the goal of an Island Expedition?<br />
The goal of an Island Expedition is to collect Azerite. The first team to 6000 Azerite wins.<br />
A group of NPCs from the opposing faction will also be present, competing with you for the Azerite.<br />
Many things on the Island reward Azerite: chests, Azerite crystals, powerful creatures, friendly NPCs in need of aid, killing enemy NPCs, and more.<br />
You’ll find things you can interact with, scattered all across the Island to help you.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: this feature is currently in an alpha state. There are several placeholder elements and missing pieces. Many updates are on their way.<br />
<br />
Thank you for testing, and we’re looking forward to your feedback.<br />
<br />
And watch out for Sneaky Pete :]<br />
<br />
<br />
Dynamic Replayability<br />
The team wants Islands to be a unique experience every time you queue up for one. There are countless different themes, enemies and environments you can come across and it's random each time you start one. Islands will have distinct visuals including abandoned Gilnean islands or Ungol ruins. There will also be different puzzles and obstacles to face every time you visit. In one scenario you could find a bunch of friendly trolls and aid them but in the next one these trolls could be possessed and attack you. Other scenarios include finding shrines or fighting against a giant crab.<br />

<br />
<br />
Enemy AI<br />
Battle for Azeroth will feature new NPC AI for Island Expeditions. This AI is not scripted and will not behave in the way a normal creature usually does. This new AI will behave in a more PVP orientated fashion. Examples include polymorphing or sapping your healer while you are engaged in a boss fight. This AI also is well aware of important map objectives and will constantly be giving you a run for your money as you race to complete objectives. This AI can make strategic decisions as well. They may stop what they are doing to come disrupt the objective you are working on or to steal your azerite. Different opponents will also have distinct personalities and unique behaviors. An example would be Sneaky Pete, a rogue who likes to disrupt healers.<br />

Difficulty Modes<br />
Island Expeditions have 4 difficult modes:<br />
<br />
Normal<br />
Heroic<br />
Mythic<br />
PVP<br />
<br />
Island Consumables<br />
A seafaring vendor shows up at the docks each day to provide unqiue buffs and consumables to use on the island. These power ups tend to fill in role gaps. Examples include buffs to make an Arms http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior more tanky or another consumable that allows a http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage to heal.<br />

Rewards<br />
The team hasn't finalized on all the rewards yet, but they have said azerite, unique mounts and new toys are definitely options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, averaged about 15 minutes, but I didn't do many. A tank or healer would be helpful, at one point the enemy AI all suddenly focused me and bad things happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this what it really is, or am I overexagerating?<br />
That's what it will come down to.<br />
<br />
All the 'omg it's different every time!' bluster will be as effective as 'guys there's hundreds of world quests it'll be different EVERY TIME' - i.e. you'll have seen it all after three days and the differences will be academic to begin with. It'll all be various base formulas with minor variations, there will be clearly superior strategies, and the time limit will make sure that at any serious level it will once again be the domain of short-CD burst classes and the respective healers/tanks much like M+.<br />
<br />
I'd be surprised if they can balance mythic difficulty in ways that allow for true class balance without enabling degenerate cheese strategies, which everyone will subsequently exploit.<br />
<br />
Reward structure will probably be out of whack in some way at the start.</div></div><hr />

However with the idea that the enemy may stop what they are doing to stop you etc - my only concern is if the enemy AI is a little bit &quot;Mary Sue&quot; How do they know what you are doing? Do they send a scout out (that you could kill) do they &quot;look over the ridge&quot; - or do they simply look in the code to see what their enemy is doing in a way that we could not do for them?</div></div><hr />

Is this what it really is, or am I overexagerating?<br />
<br />
I know what you mean but what did we expect from a game where 90+ % of all quests are kill this, collect that?<br />
They simply don't know what to put into the game to keep people playing except for repetitive grind. Might be a problem of the whole genre though. It might be no problem, if this kind of game is new to you but after years you simply get sick of it. Reminds me of having no problem with random encounters in JRPGs back when I was a child but now they feel really mind numbing. Of cause they always were but it takes time to realize.</div></div><hr />

Wow, so randomized and unique each time! Except all that you do is kill groups of monsters and a rare mini-boss with 0 engaging abilities, in what seems to be the most boring way possible. With pickup powerups about as imaginative as vanilla 5/5 talents. Why isn't there even a grappling hook that allows you access to closed areas? Or some 'fire blessing totem' that grants immunity to lava so that you can go into the temple of flame and not die in magma moat at the entrance. <br />
<br />
Where are interesting puzzles to solve? Jumping puzzles for people who want that type of challenge? This was the perfect place for them. I swear, most of world quests are more imaginitive than this, eh, content.</div></div><hr />

I find it funny how people want something new to do in game, Blizzard try something new and get shat on by the community for their troubles. Almost makes one wonder why they keep bothering supporting WoW.<br />
<br />
Armchair devs ftw, they know everything better</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biomega</div><div class="date">2018-03-15, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is what they're focusing on as bite-size content.<br />
<br />
Which means it has to be accessible.<br />
<br />
Which means it has to be beatable for Johnny Inbred and his demented brother.<br />
<br />
Which means it's a complete pushover for anyone with more than two brain cells.<br />
<br />
Which means the so-called &quot;AI&quot; is going to be predictably scripted nonsense you can game into oblivion.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I realize why there can't be difficult content for features that are an accessible mainstay of the expansion. I just wish they weren't wasting so many resources on this, because I can already see it crashing, hard. It's going to be the same as scenarios were in MoP - that 'not-quite-dungeon' feel where you just go through the motions because of daily reward #27.</div></div><hr />

<br />
like others have mentioned why not add some puzzle elements. <br />
<br />
Why not give it some race elements other then collect X faster then the other guy. but more a both start from a point and need to reach the center where the azurite is kinda race.<br />
Now this feels like something where the rewards will have to be super good or people will ignore it after a game or 2. But alpha so loads of type to improve upon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stormykitten</div><div class="date">2018-03-15, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do worry about these. The problem with this kind of content for WoW is well, it's got WoW's combat, so that means the content itself has to carry the brunt. You can enjoy combat for a while at a time, but it can't carry enjoyment like in some other titles, it's just too old and the model WoW uses is too predictable (no avoiding targeted damage, etc) so that repetition is very noticeable.<br />
<br />
As soon as I saw Argus invasion points I knew this was what they were using for the island scenarios, so I managed my expectations. They can still make them more enjoyable than those for sure, but if you consider how you do invasions now, if at all - at least everybody i know will queue for a larger group to breeze them. This will not happen with these as it's an old-style scenario numberswise, so I really wonder how things will pan out.<br />
<br />
I do hope that some of those bullet points become little side-quests you WANT to do. However, I really feel like the enemy team there will prohibit such things if there is a timer. Not sure about that design either.</div></div><hr />

I honestly do not see these being any different from that. As long they reward *no* gear or anything that is required to progress in the expansion I'm fine with it.</div></div><hr />

It very well might be boring - but who cares? New technology is making it's way to the game, which then can be used for later content development. That level of zone randomization is totally different from what we've seen in WoW so far and the NPC's intelligence being worked on is definitely another point which can refresh the feel of combats in general. Imagine a raid boss who tries to figure out which enemies he can kill easily or where he can land the most AoE damage. That would totally change the way encounters work today. Try to think of it as a tech-demo, rather than something being the main feature of the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

This feature looks promising as hell, and I can't wait to see in what ways they'll surprise us with it! The Negative Nancies are all looking at the feature with what's currently possible in mind, which is probably why they're bitching so hard.</div></div><hr />

It is extremely easy to make an AI that just wrecks everybody. It is also extremely easy to make an AI that is pawnable even by noobs. Getting it 'just right' is an ever-shifting precarious balance as players discover how to 'blind-sight' the AI time and time again. To 'fix' it without then falling oveer the other side of the cliff where players are continuously pawned and get frustrated is ... well, let's call it an 'interesting challenge'.</div></div><hr />

Hell it looks like it belongs in MoP and even there people would've probably ignored it for the most part - much like scenarios.</div></div><hr />

But at first glance, and I recognize there might be some missing features, these look lame as hell. Seems to be something copy/pasted directly from Diablo 3. Shrines, health orbs, &quot;randomization,&quot; and tiered difficulties. I couldn't tell if it just looked so lame because the PoV was a fire mage, which looks boring as fuck to play, or because they genuinely are just vacant and boring. It's the new BG (which I thought sucked), with some baked in mobs that supposedly have new AI, but look to be dumb as hell, and that's it? Here's to hoping there is a lot missing or that the higher difficulties/pvp scenarios will have some flavor, but this does not have me hyped. At least the zones are looking nice.</div></div><hr />

But the island is to fight the other fraction as NPC or PvP Group. So if you win the other team losses and sinks. Means your group is alone on the island without competition and wins...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doing them with other players might be more interesting but that largely depends on class design for BfA and AI of the NPCs<br />
<br />
Might actually be cool if you could go up against other players defending too...</div></div><hr />
