Beasts of the Savage Lands – Frostfire Ridge<br />
Arming yourself with knowledge is essential if you’re hoping to survive the savage world of Draenor. In this series, we’ll talk about the different creatures you may encounter as you explore this untamed world. While not comprehensive, this should give you an idea of what to expect as you prepare to face the challenges ahead. Here’s a look at some of the creatures that can be found in Frostfire Ridge:<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Magnaron<br />
Ancient creatures of molten stone, the magnaron are directly descended from the colossals who first shaped Draenor. There are few living today who can communicate with these enigmatic giants, and fewer still who understand their seemingly chaotic motivations. Among the roiling lava spouts of Frostfire Ridge, the magnaron carve fiery sigils into the earth and shape entire mountains to their needs. Magnaron have been known to both enslave and befriend elemental furies, and they are seldom alone. Approach with caution!<br />
<br />
<br />

http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/mvbar900.jpg<br />
<br />
Ogron<br />
Ogres, gronn, and magnaron all share a common lineage, with the beastly ogron demonstrating the missing link between savage gronn and their smaller, more numerous children. They take in their surroundings with a single yellow eye—slow to blink and even slower to comprehend. Too idiotic to disobey orders, but big and dangerous enough to keep even unruly ogres in line, ogron serve as expendable muscle for ogre leaders from warlords all the way up to the emperor himself. Any champions seeking to overthrow ogres in power had best prepare to face down one or more ogron towering in their way.<br />

http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/mvbar900.jpg<br />
<br />
Rylak<br />
The versatile, flying rylak have adapted to climates across Draenor, but their greatest density is in Frostfire Ridge. Here, warm volcanic stone ledges make for excellent nesting sites, while snowy featureless expanses serve as prime hunting grounds for these ferocious predators to seek flesh with their dual sets of eyes and nostrils. Their thick hides protect them from the elements, as well as from the arrows of frustrated hunters. Adventurers seeking to display a two-headed rylak trophy should remain wary of both sets of fangs . . . and those seeking to tame a new mount should consider the Iron Horde’s tendency to armor the largest rylaks and lead them into combat. <br />
<br />

<br />
Frostwolves<br />
Only the hardiest can survive the unforgiving climate of Frostfire Ridge. Numbering among the natives are the sturdy frostwolves. The Frostwolf orc clan has taken these beasts as their symbol and namesake, and the orcs and their wolf companions fight and hunt together as an extended pack family.<br />
<br />
Explorers in Frostfire Ridge should be wary of the frostwolf’s undomesticated cousin, the dangerous garn. These enormous beasts, twice the mass of an Azerothian bear, are identified by their massive jaws and jet-black fur. Even the Frostwolf orcs fear the unruly and wild garn.<br />
<br />
There are still countless other dangerous creatures out there, all of them looking forward to their next adventurer-sized meal—so keep your eyes open and your weapons sharp. Do you have what it takes to survive in Draenor?<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor - Upcoming Warrior Changes<br />
So, we don't often share our thoughts on upcoming changes this early, as plans can change very rapidly. Please keep in mind that none of the following is set in stone – it hasn't even been developed yet – and there’s any number of issues that could cause us to decide to take a different approach. That said, we definitely agree that Arms feels a bit empty at the moment, and want to fill it out a bit more, and we want to add some talent choices to both Arms and Fury that provide options for more involved gameplay. Here’s what we're thinking:<br />
<br />
Rage generation increased by 20% for Arms. Rend returns for Arms. Costs 10 Rage, deals damage over 18sec, with a burst of bleed damage at the end. Total damage is similar to a Mortal Strike. Thunder Clap is usable in any stance. AoE damage and snares, 6sec cooldown. 30 Rage cost for Arms, free for Protection. We’re replace the level 45 talent row (Staggering Shout / Piercing Howl / Disrupting Shout) with:<br />
Varies by spec:<br />
Arms – Taste for Blood: Passive. Rend ticks grant 3 Rage. Fury – Furious Strikes: Passive. Reduces the cost of Wild Strike by 10 Rage. Protection – Heavy Repercussions: Passive. Shield Slam deals 50% additional damage while Shield Block or Shield Charge is active. Sudden Death: Passive. Auto attacks have a chance to trigger Sudden Death, making your next Execute free and usable on targets above 20% health. Varies by spec:<br />
Arms – Slam: Active ability. Costs 10 Rage. Deals 100% weapon damage. Each consecutive use increases Slam’s damage by 50% and Rage cost by 100%, stacking up to 2 times. Fury – Unquenchable Thirst: Passive. Bloodthirst has no cooldown. Protection – Unyielding Strikes: Passive. Devastate reduces the Rage cost of Heroic Strike by 6, stacking up to 5 times. Lasts 10 sec. No longer refreshes while at 5 stacks.<br />
<br />
Again, this is all very much in the formative stages. Any or all of the above could end up changing in any number of ways. But we are listening, and are doing our best to make Warrior gameplay awesome in Warlords.<br />
<br />
EDIT: As mentioned, lots of iteration on these early plans. Changed the +25% Rage gen to +20%, so that 3.6speed weapon swings generate an even 30 rage. Changed Slam's max stack count to 2, since Slamming at any point higher than that is a trap.<br />
<br />
EDIT 2: Clarified that Heavy Repercussions does count Shield Charge as well.<br />
<br />
(Finally, and this is mild, but the flavor names for skills/passives for warriors could stand to be a little bit cooler. &quot;Unyielding Strikes&quot; is up there with &quot;Unwavering Sentinel&quot; for being florid.)<br />
&quot;Hey guys, I'm ready to make that post about DPS Warrior plans, but we don't have a name for that idea we brainstormed an hour ago. Relentless something... Frequent attacks turn into Heroic Strike spam... Unyielding? Sure, Unyielding sounds good. Unyielding Strikes. *clicks Submit*&quot;<br />
<br />
The earlier we let you see into the design process, the more unpolished it will be. That said, I don't know that Unyielding Strikes is the worst name... <br />

Yeah, in between every quest mob that takes me down to 10% HP I will &quot;conjure food&quot; and eat for 20 sec. <br />
If every quest mob is taking you down to 10% HP, you can spend those 20sec figuring out how to perform better. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/481954726401933314))<br />
mechanics are during combat, and instant we have to sit down and eat AFTER, and if we die? Oh well, too bad your a mage.<br />
Most of the self-sustainability stuff we've added or improved is for after combat. During combat, you should kill the enemy. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/481974268721250304))<br />

Will we ever see petless Frost Mage?<br />
No, Squirt is a core, iconic part of Frost Mages' kit. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/481973886892769280))<br />
<br />
Fact is mages have 2 self-heals, Evocate (which sucks) and Temporal Shield.<br />
Right, because Mages are about avoiding damage, not healing through it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482041370563973120))<br />
<br />
Is Arcane Orb supposed to hit more than one per target?<br />

Will Arcane Blast's multistrike's hits grant Arcane Charges? And multstrike for arcane missles, will they proc for each wave?<br />

Does it concern you that Destro does more dps than Demo, while being more simple to learn and master? Effort should be rewarded.<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482329292005584896))<br />
<br />
Any huge Warlock changes coming up, or are you guys satisfied with where we ended in Mists?<br />
Tweaks coming, no major changes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482332968191811584))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
At the end of WoD, I anticipate druid tanks that stack MS having over 1 mil health, if not far more. HP, high, dps, low<br />
A) It'll be more than that. B) DPS Low? Huh? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482011790209867776))<br />
Why bother with an item squish if youre just going back to SOO numbers in WOD? Will you squish every expac?<br />
Tank health is not the same as all numbers. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482013335034941441))<br />
will that be consistent or will DPS be lower relative to the tanks in WoD? (less than half? 1/4th?)<br />
DPS will absolutely be lower health, relative to tanks. That's why I said that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/482013985261117440))<br />
<br />
Any chance flex raids go down to 5 people? Would like to play w/ 1 or 2 friends, but getting 7 good people to join us is tough.<br />
In many cases, raid mechanics break down completely below a certain size. Group Finder in Warlords should help you find a few more (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/482645666313691136))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
What about the information on battleground objectives being displayed on the map and such? That still in?<br />
It did not make it for 6.0 unfortunately (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/481950462879358976))<br />
<br />
Related to my last tweet: holy moly the default arena frames are terrible. my friend, maybe an update in WoD for those?<br />
Not at 6.0 but we'd like to build a complete UI solution for enemy frames in PvP. But it got cut for 6.0. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/481993658007175170))<br />
<br />
I'd still like to know your position on abilities that really unbalance class vs class in PvP. Rock, Paper, Scissors isn't ideal<br />
We want classes to have powerful and unique things about them whenever possible. We don't want to balance to mediocrity. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/481996828242501632))<br />
<br />
if the mmr tanking issues are a side effect to the deserter fix can we expect it to be fixed properly to drop the way it used to?<br />
No (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/482302579901087745))<br />
<br />
Why do this and dont just instead make normal pve - non elite pvp share same model.<br />
It is a matter of how much content we can produce each tier. We've elected to do different models for elite. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/482545104368832512))<br />
<br />
They must not have a lot of faith in Ashran WPVP if they’re going to force it by putting both capitals in it. <br />
Not sure how we're forcing it on you. The capital hubs are just outside Ashran. You don't have to go there. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/482568840417533953))<br />
<br />
Will there also be a way to get unflagged faster once you are flagged? Being flagged for 5 mins after leaving a BG feels pointless<br />
There was a time when people would abuse those queues to escape world PvP confrontations. With the new rule, it may not be necessary (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/482571177294983168))<br />
<br />
do you have an opinion/goal for how long the average 2s/3s match should last?<br />
5-10 minutes is a good goal (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/482613710146371584))<br />

Siege of Orgrimmar Feedback Thread<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar should be testable, including Mythic difficulty, and should be open throughout the Beta period. I'm definitely interested in hearing feedback about all difficulties. Please specify your group experience, which difficulty you did, and overall impressions like the above.<br />
<br />
Abilities that felt wildly untuned or bugged are particularly worth noting.<br />
<br />
In general, we're erring on the side of converted SoO feeling a bit easier than it does in 5.4. (That's part of why the Feats of Strength for clearing Siege will stop being available in 6.0, instead of when Draenor unlocks.)

Soloing old Raid Content<br />
We'll make changes to older encounters if it's needed for players to retain the ability to solo raid content from previous expansions.<br />
<br />
While you're at it, could you guys make it so we can do Thorim in Ulduar without having to be one of a few classes or really lucky/fast? And don't forget Dreamwalker from ICC!<br />
We're making a change at some point in the future to some legacy raids that includes changing it so Thorim no longer spawns a deathball and reset when his arena is empty.<br />
<br />
You can also skip Valithria if you're an engineer.<br />
That fight will become optional, so non-healers can get past the fight.<br />

That fight will become optional, so non-healers can get past the fight.<br />
Great news EXCEPT for the fact that we still won't be able to farm her for transmog gear.[/i]<br />

They're not talking about it being difficult to make different faces, although I'm sure it's more difficult than you can imagine. What's difficult is that they're trying to maintain the same feel of the original models, so that people who like the old ones won't be upset with the new changes and they'll still feel like your old character. It looks like they concerned themselves with making the new models first, and now they're tweaking the faces. If they would have waited to release the models after that was done, everyone would be freaking out that the models weren't going to be done at all. Chill out.</div></div><hr />

not even all the models are confirmed for release. <br />

they obviously are trying to get all of the base models done so that as many people as possible will atleast have A FACE. <br />

Maybe it just means they concentrate more on the quality of the core content and how enjoyable it is rather than the animation of how a character model blinks...and yet they are still working to appease the crowds who are obsessed with every square centimeter of pixels on a character model. For an expansion that is still in development, I'm not too worried they are going to settle with a crap model. Despite the rudeness, they listen and deliver. They can't please everyone but hey, as you said, there's always the F2P MMOs. ;)</div></div><hr />

WoW is taking a much more difficult route of upgrading and updating character models in a game already built around a specific model and animation set. They have to be very careful that 1) The new models don't break the world around them, meaning they have to match animations closely to anything used in, let's say, cutscenes, and thus have to make sure that the new skeletons rig out right and 2) they want to get as close to the original model as possible in order not to upset people who like their current toons. Anyone else remember when EQ1 updated their character models? The screams echoed through time, they were so loud.<br />
<br />
Also, as far as faces go, they're not just slapping skin over new bone structure - they have to rig each individual face for the new facial animations. I would imagine that each face requires a slightly different rig, since the positioning of eyebrows/noses/mouths/tentacles/etc is different on a per-face basis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Art is very time consuming work and very often personal to the artist. And you can't really rush it, if you do, it will look even worse and no one wants that. They see the issue just as we do, they maybe see even more issues. There is no doubt they are trying to fix it. You go to work on one model, once you are done with it, you do the next. Now during the process of working on the second model you find new ways of doing it. Now, the first one may look bad compared to the second, as an artist you want to keep it all equal and you might rework the first one. Never ending cycle. So please, be respectful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding mage mobility, er, it's been nerfed quite a bit (see recent nerfs to FN and COC CDs), and anyway this mobility mostly applies to frost and not fire/arcane, whereas melee mobility is mostly unchanged. So unless the idea is that it's frost or gtfo, the minimal amount of self-heals is an issue.<br />
<br />
As for destro/demo, destro had a complex rotation in Cata, but it was clunky and uneven. The same goes for demo's rotation now. Destro could do with a bit more complexity, albeit I think the embers have achieved this to a degree (certainly in PVP, maybe in PVE), but I think it's in a good place.</div></div><hr />

Do you mind telling us where you heard they were finished?

I really think WOW staff has just become too bloated. It appears to me the problem isn´t with the amount of time it takes the artists to do something, but in the time it takes 10 layers of managers to approve everything and probably each with the ability to kick stuff back to the artist. It is what happens when organizations get too successful, they just get bloated with middle- manager who mainly do nothing but try to justify their jobs.<br />
<br />
The process should be<br />
<br />
Artist &gt; Art director &gt; added to game<br />
<br />
These guys talk about committees and meetings.. it just means a lot of payroll going to people who aren´t contributing to the game and who probably all are making the jobs of the artists suck really bad.</div></div><hr />

And then do that for every.single.face. to every race, each variation, and make sure each face doesn't some how manage to break their emotes. Funny how you just so happened to forget that much of it.<br />
<br />
Unless you have a collage degree in 3D modeling, I'm going to assume you don't understand the full extent of what all the whiny people are asking for. It stuns me that all these people screaming same face can't get their heads wrapped around the fact that if they waste time making THEM happy the rest of us are going to have to wait even LONGER for WoD.

I think you're just plain lying to yourself if you're deliberately choosing to be negative towards Blizzard no matter what they say. The devs working on the character models have said countless flipping times that same face syndrome is something they really want to address, and that they are working towards that. They've acknowledged the problem for fucks sake, they've said they plan to fix it - what else do you want from them? I think folks like you just want to be negative no matter the circumstance.

Arrogant? She's a bad player who inadvertently outed herself on twitter as such, then picked a fight with someone with far greater observational knowledge about how people fare in situations like the one she was complaining about. Celestalon was absolutely correct in what he said - daily quest mobs can either be tuned as a modest challenge for lower geared, lower skill toons/players (like in 5.0 GL dailies), or they can be faceroll AOEstomp for everyone. <br />
<br />
But someone who has to drink for 20s after every fight in that situation has skill issues, even in new-90 greens and blues. She probably wasn't using half of her toolbox, or keeping any sort of situational awareness or smart movement, or something.
