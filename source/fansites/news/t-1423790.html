Warcraft Movie Cast Announcement<br />
Legendary announced (https://twitter.com/Legendary/status/413461860550070272) that Daniel Wu (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0943079/) and Clancy Brown (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000317/) will also be joining the Warcraft movie cast. Daniel Wu recently appeared in Europa Report and Clancy Brown regularly appears in and does voices for TV shows. It isn't his first time working on a Warcraft project though, as he was Thrall (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ6tg1Id6-c&amp;list=PL780265A4FFFD41E8#t=3) in the cancelled Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans) game.<br />

Warlords of Draenor Music<br />
Is there going to be any new music in WoD? I find it surprising that nobody has asked this question. I love the music in the game and wondering if they've kept up to the scale and quality of previous expansions. <br />
As always, you can expect some new music in the expansion. I couldn't answer as to how much yet, but if you look back over the years, you'll see that we've added many hours of music on a fairly consistent basis. Also, being able to see the Draenei and Karabor in a new light should be illuminating to the auditory system. We'll do what we can to provide any sneak listens or insights we can along the path to the release of the expansion. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/286200-new-music-in-wod/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10949565146?page=1#7))<br />

Warlords of Draenor Timeline<br />
I guess im bothered that actions in this past, wont affect present day. it's considered &quot;separate&quot;.<br />
Iron Horde orcs are pouring through the Dark Portal into your home. It will absolutely be affecting your present day... and you were just starting to make a sandwich. Jerks. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/286098-wod-is-creativly-bankrupt/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10787819154?page=20#394))<br />
<br />
Legendary Cloak Effort<br />
The point of this thread is to state.... this is by far the most complcated time consuming Legendary ever in this game.<br />
Hah, well thanks for laying it out visually. I think we like how it worked out in essence, ultimately having something for even the LFR player to work toward over a long period of time is a great goal to have for people. Definitely a lot of lessons learned on how we can make steps feel less grindy, and maybe make the experience more cohesive. But having that kind of Legendary doesn't necessarily preclude us from also having a Legendary that's maybe class specific and more of a personal challenge like Fangs, or something like the Warlock green fire quest. We don't think it necessarily has to be one or the other. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/286107-legendary-cloak-takes-no-effortspoilers/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10951205178?page=1#16))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Character / Items<br />
That's an answer to a different question. Currently spirit does nothing for mage, but something for SPriest.<br />
We allowed the Shadow conversion in a weak moment, but they had alternatives. Balance and Elemental did not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403952196883972096))<br />
<br />
Why the sweeping itemization changes for WoD? Lack of Agi/Str on secondary pieces halves the power.<br />
So we double the amount of attack power on an item? That's an easy tweak, not a reason to dislike the system IMO. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405462190561308672))<br />
AGI also increases crit. Without AGI on 1/3 of equipment this a major loss in effectiveness.<br />
Or we could just boost crit chance. Again, these seem to be easily solved details and not a reason to reject the design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405498738749108224))<br />
<br />
Unsure you're best to ask this, but: Will all of Draenor be explorable (achievement-wise) at expansion launch? Or not til 6.1?<br />
All at launch. Is this related to flying? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405464558090739712))<br />
<br />
So since healer armour will be shared with dps, will the &quot;Bonus&quot; random stats affect healers too? Multistrike, cleave, etc.<br />
Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407313720138690561))<br />
is the cleave stat going to affect healers and the way they heal?<br />
The idea is it could heal nearby targets like the SoO trinket. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407313167367168000))<br />
<br />
Simple question. Will secondary stats be random on gear in WoD too? Chest of Awesome always has haste + mastery off 1st boss?<br /> 
For a raid boss drop, the secondary stats will likely be the same every time. May not be the case of other sources of loot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405460435609976832))<br />
<br />
Are Dodge and Parry getting rolled into Armor specifically as a stat?<br />
No. Tanks will have a fixed amount of dodge and parry, perhaps with CDs or procs that buff it temporarily. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405461435594969089))<br />

Yeah, them saying they'll be able to balance it when it's a totally new system for them to balance(something they took 9 years to almost get right with the current system) doesn't instill confidence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People are focusing on the first part of the equation and missing the second part. Yes, if the first boss now drops haste/mastery chest that your spec hates, In MoP, that would be a major issues since there might only be one other boss in the entire raid that drops a plate chest for your spec. But because everyone is sharing gear, the loot tables will be completely different. It might now be that every other boss drops a chest piece. There will still be a BIS for your spec, but there may be 7 bosses that drop upgrades. So maybe if this is the first week of a raid, yeah, that first boss drop with bad stats is an upgrade and you roll for it. But for the next 12 weeks, you have many chances each week to upgrade it with better stats from 6 different bosses.<br />
<br />
My guess is that they are going to simply have every combination of secondary stats on every gear slot.<br />
<br />
Boss 1 chest H/M<br />
Boss 3 chest H/C<br />
Boss 5 chest M/C<br />
Boss 7 Chest C/new stat1<br />
Boss 9 Chest H/new stat1<br />
Boss 11 Chest M/new stat1<br />
Boss 13 Chest H/new stat2<br />
<br />
I don´t agree with them for eliminating reforging, but I think there will be enough ´side-grades´ within a tier to where we can get away from our worst stats pretty easily.</div></div><hr />

There will probably be some women in the movie, but if there aren't, i think it won't end the world or bring never-before seen destruction to our planet, so chill, our species will survive, except for some feminists who might have strokes after seeing the lack of women in the movie.<br />

No, I was making an analogy on the spectrum of diversity and rather than understand that you went with one of the pettiest interpretations of context you could manage in an effort to feel like you're being intellectually persecuted by the ignorant. Meanwhile your own ignorance is hiding behind the shield of protecting the under represented while you're oblivious to the point. There are multiple female roles in this movie, if you had more than a shallow interest in stirring up controversy or making token attempts to assert your views you might know that. And you also ignore a statement on artificially embellishing a story purely based on a token representation of diversity, but don't let me stop you from wearing that persecution complex with pride.<br />

<br />
It made me remember the wonder and awe I had when I first started the game/genre which has now turned to bitchy, cynical contempt at the fact that yet another avenue of entertainment is being destroyed by blatant greed. <br />
Where we once had gamers in development we now have accountants and people like Kotick, who base success on the bottom line not game play. <br />
<br />
Sadly unless something changes in 2014 I really think my time with MMOs is coming to an end, when profit driven decisions are more glaringly apparent than game play driven decisions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or maybe I didn't get enough sleep last night, I don't know, all I know is when I think of MMOs now I don't get excited, my first thought is &quot;How are they going to try and gouge the player base this time&quot;<br />

Though it won't stop you complaining :p<br />
<br />
Anyway, awesome casting, imo. No idea who the other guy is thought tbh :S<br />
Color me excited then, I loved Tyrannus' voice!</div></div><hr />

Meanwhile your own ignorance is hiding behind the shield of protecting the under represented while you're oblivious to the point. There are multiple female roles in this movie, if you had more than a shallow interest in stirring up controversy or making token attempts to assert your views you might know that. And you also ignore a statement on artificially embellishing a story purely based on a token representation of diversity, but don't let me stop you from wearing that persecution complex with pride.<br />

Warcraft has had different ethnicities in the human race for a while now.<br />

No, actually you compared a gender to a disability. And you call me ignorant. That's cute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Clancy Brown, fuck yes. Terenas, probably, but I could also see him as Antonidas, Lothar, Khadgar, or even Medivh.</div></div><hr />

You do know you're a braying jackass of a moron, right? It was clearly addressing your stupidity of &quot;Why are there no women in this movie?!?!?!?!?!&quot;, disregarding completely that Paula Patton has already signed on, and knowing full well that this story could not be told WITHOUT females. His answer was &quot;Why are there no &lt;insert population base here&gt;?&quot; to show how asinine and stupid your argument was from the start. You can keep being willfully retarded to avoid the point and keep carrying that cross on your back, but no one will weep for you when you hang yourself from it with the nails of utter stupidity.<br />
