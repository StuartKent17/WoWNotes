Did the spawned trash that came with Eadric the Pure, and then he just stood there and never engaged us.<br />

All in all, the mounted combat is just for the first trash and is fine in the instance, as long as they fix the multitude of bugs.</div></div><hr />

Lots have made it through<br />
<br />
1st boss for normal is 3 horde champions mounted, then after beating them mounted (crash here currently) you fight them on foot.<br />
2nd boss i Eadric the pure<br />
3rd boss is black knight, black knight you kill multiple times before he stays dead.<br />
<br />
Doing heroic now, normal is pretty easy for premades/ulduar 25 gear</div></div><hr />

Err, we had Eadric the Pure with trash packs as the second encounter on Heroic. He wouldn't engage either, just stood there as a friendly NPC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Argent Tournament is suppost to be an event set up by Tirion to bring us together to fight the Lich King. Inside the 5 man, do we actually kill the champions or just merely defeat them? Reason being is it's kinda silly to be all like. <br />
<br />
Tirion: Oh my bad alliance guy your champions are dead!<br />
Alliance Guy: Wait what?!<br />
<br />
Might seem like a silly question but considering the purpose of the tournaments intentions i dont really think killing each other's champions is a good idea of bringing us together as allies against then Lich King and his forces : o</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the 5 man the champions of the horde/alliance that you &quot;defeat&quot; simply kneel down and admit that you've beaten them. You don't actually kill them. In the 25 man raid though, the datamined audio files seem to suggest that you actually kill off strong members of the opposing faction. We'll just have to wait for tomorrow's EU testing to see for sure.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Curiousness</div><div class="date">2009-07-11, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I ran this earlier with my guild on the PTR.<br />
<br />
1st attempt: We realized you can hop from horse to horse and refill your HP while forcing the mobs to switch aggro. Neat. We get to the 3 champs, I switch horses, all 3 champs disappear, we have to start over. Gay.<br />
<br />
2nd attempt: Three of us DC as the first wave of mobs attacks. While they're relogging, both of the remaining players' horses die. We get dismounted and immediately DC. No one's in the instance, so it resets. Gay again.<br />
<br />
3rd attempt: Ok, so no switching horses on the champs, no dying or else you DC. Tank through all 3 waves, tank through the 3 champs until they're all grounded and trampled. At which point, all of our horses disappear, DCing all 5 of us. Awesome. We log back in dead, zone in, heal up, and we see the 3 champs standing there waiting to be attacked. Awesome again. We tank and spank them down, pretty easy (the shaman healed, so we killed it first), one by one they knelt down in submission. All 3 are down aaand.. Nothing. They're just chilling there. Gay #3.<br />
<br />
4th attempt: Ok, no horse switching, no dying, when all 3 champs get knocked off we all get DC'd so we all have an additional PTR client running ready to log us in as quick as possible, full buffs so we're ready for the ground phase. Here we go, no screw ups. The first wave comes at us aaaaand everyone but me DCs. Or rather, everyone but me DC'd until my mount died, at which point I DC'd as well. Fuck this place.</div></div><hr />

Can't handle what? The fight? Cause we clearly already did that. With ease, I might add.<br />
<br />
Can't handle the fight when every move we make leads to a DC? Shocking how that works.</div></div><hr />

I was here for the Ulduar test too. Know how many times I tried to DPS a boss only to DC? Zero. Were there random bugs? Sure. Did the servers come down a lot? Absolutely. Was there EVER a time that simply playing the game lead to repeated and unavoidable DCs? No. <br />

The very fact that the mechanics of the fight DC players means you have to test it.<br />
