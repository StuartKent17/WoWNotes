Operation Gnomeregan / Recapturing Echo Isles<br />
Players of all levels will be able to take part in some form or another. We'll have more details for you as we get a little closer to the event. (Source (&quot;]<br />
&#13;	http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/flags/europeanunion.gif[url=&quot;))<br />
<br />
Class cooldowns<br />
It's just a matter of degree. Slice and Dice isn't too bad used as every other finisher or so (though even then it's such a game-changer that having it fall off is devastating). Slice and Dice as something you had to do every other attack would be masochistic (and yeah, Hunger for Blood might be close).<br />
<br />
Brain Freeze doesn't proc all that often to where you're literally doing Frost Bolt / Fireball / Frost Bolt / Fireball.<br />
<br />
Really though one of the biggest differences is the role. If dps specs don't have some kind of rotation or priority system, they become boring to play. With tanks and healers, they have a lot going on in addition to using their abilities. We do ask dps specs to sometimes do really important things in a raid, and they often have to move out of the fire or whatever, but then again, so do the healers and tanks.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying tanks shouldn't be hitting buttons often. They need to in order to be fun. But there are two extremes that both sort of suck. One is you have to hit a button constantly that has very little depth to the decision. The other is that you never want to push the button because you're saving it. Cooldown plays into this a lot. On a 15 sec cooldown, any time you're saving the ability, you're probably wasting it. On a 60 min cooldown, any time you use the ability you feel like you're wasting it. Somewhere in the 2-3 minute timeframe you can feel like it's okay to use the abilities often, but you can also hold them on occasion for those scary periods where the boss is bursting damage on you or the healers are repositioning or whatever.<br />
<br />
I don't think we're horribly off with the cooldowns today, but I think we are off.<br />
(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23767557794-just-get-rid-of-dodge-and-parry-altogether.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking control and cooldowns<br />
Yeah we think this is a problem. It makes sense that a tank need to spend some percentage of button presses on the &quot;staying alive&quot; component of tanking and not all on the &quot;boss control&quot; part of tanking. We just need a &quot;staying alive&quot; button that doesn't feel very maintenance-y. There is kind of a sweet spot between pushing something on cooldown and never ever pushing it because you need to save it for an emergency that might not ever come.<br />
<br />
We've also kind of let tanks (except DKs) opt out of having to manage their resource, and threat by and large isn't hard to maintain on single targets, at least 10-20 seconds into a fight. Tanks always have a lot of responsibility for positioning the mob and everything but that probably still leaves some bandwidth for making decisions about staying alive that we aren't really filling at the moment.<br />
<br />
Shield Block (and Holy Shield) will be more meaningful in the Cataclysm block model too. <br />
<br />
[...] Just wanted to point out that I used &quot;boss control&quot; specifically instead of &quot;maintain threat.&quot; Tanks are asked to turn dragons away from the raid, kite dudes across the room, swap with another tank, get out of the fire without failing to do any of the previous, maybe interrupt (on 10-player raids) and so on. On some fights this is a pretty small piece of the puzzle. On others it's huge. If juggling cooldowns and managing threat take a lot of your attention, then boss control becomes overwhelming on some fights. If doing all of the above is too simple then on say Patchwerk (Festergut?) you're not doing much.

<br />
Overgearing encounters<br />
There can be something in between Heroic Shadow Labs when it shipped and Heroic Nexus today in your 251 / 264 gear. Stopping to crowd control some of the pulls isn't so terribly onerous, given that the dungeons themselves are a lot shorter than they were in the day when Scholomance was serious business.<br />
<br />
I'll still argue some (but not all) of it was the gear. Naxx was available immediately and relatively undertuned, especially in the 25 player version. In BC I spent a lot of time finishing up all of those Shadowmoon quests with blue rewards so that I could handle Karazhan. In Lich King many of us were in Naxx before we saw some of the heroic dungeons. By the time we got back to those dungeons, we totally overgeared them.<br />
<br />
Heroic Halls of Reflection isn't a great example because of the nature of the first room, but if you look at something like Heroic Pit of Saron, that dungeon took a bit of learning before it was a milk run. The pulls before the tunnel at the end typically require crowd control until you overgear it with raid drops and Frost badge gear.<br />
<br />
But to go back to the Naxx example, if all the Blizzards, Pestilences and Volleys hit for less damage, then you'd single target stuff down more, and it all of the mobs weren't dying at once, then the tank would be in more danger from dying to too much damage. (This will be particularly true when block doesn't scale so well to lots of weak attackers.)<br />
<br />
We give classes a lot of tools and when half of those tools (to exaggerate) aren't ever used, then classes feel shallow. Not every pull will require CC, but more of them will than today. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23767190994-the-warrior-model--cc-is-not-coming-back.html))<br />
<br />
Minor Glyphs<br />
I would disagree and say that all of the minor rogue glyphs are pretty decent in one way or another. So maybe this is just a detachment of what people see as useful for their own play style. They're certainly more subjective than &quot;you must have these major glyphs if you're this spec&quot;. But I think that's pretty cool, that you can pick and choose the ones that match what you want to do and not have a clear &quot;omg you HAVE to have these or you're a dumb!&quot;<br />
<br />
[...] Bottom line is that some minor glyphs are certainly considered by a lot of people as more 'useful' than others, and obviously not every class has the same spells, abilities, and desire for what glyphs provide so there's not going to be a homogenization of glyph 'worth' through standardized effect (nor should there be). I would disagree that there aren't useful minor glyphs for every class. Are they useful to you? Maybe not. Like any part of the game there's room for improvement, and certainly with Cataclysm and the class changes there will need to be glyph additions/changes to go along with them.

Judging from a quick perusal of the Internet, my hastily written post up above confused some people. My apologies. The point I was trying to make was that 3.3.3 BM seems pretty close to SV in a lot of cases. We're not going to know more until we see more humans and fewer spreadsheets try it out. Players raid SV today and can be relatively competitive on meters. Therefore hopefully players who like BM can do the same thing. Are all 3 hunter specs within 1% of each other on all gear? No, and I don't think that's a reasonable goal. We'll try to narrow the gap where we can without forcing every player to respec to the whatever the current flavor of the month hotness is or creating balance nightmares in PvP. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767539635-bm-hunters-still-need-help.html))<br />
<br />
With my current gear, my BM spec trails a SV spec by 7.8% in potential dps. Compared to MM, BM is 13.4% behind. When I plug in the BiS gear in every slot I find BM trailing SV by 8.9% and the gap between BM and MM increases to 16.7%. I also have to add that I did not gem for anything but Agi in any of the specs so the ArP factor is reduced. I only have 426 passive ArP with my gear. Even without massive amounts of ArP, BM still is way behind MM and considerably behind SV as well. <br />
<br />
We didn't obviously compare the gear of every hunter out there. We looked at a few different levels of progression and BM is pretty close to SV in a lot of cases. Eurytos up above thinks BM is pretty close to SV, and in fact I'll quote him in a minute. If you're a BM fan I think you can raid as BM in 3.3.3 without utterly embarrassing yourself. Are there hunters out there who can out dps you? Sure. But there would be hunters out there who could beat you even if you were both MM. Any of us can pull out parses where the Elemental shaman or Shadow priest or Blood DK is topping the meters for that particular raid and still making ICC progression. Let's assume BM and SV are 1500-2000 dps behind MM. At that level, the damage is probably close enough where skill and gear are going to have a much greater impact than your spec for most of you.<br />
<br />
Is that acceptable for Lich King 25 hard mode? Probably not. But the guilds at that level of progression are obsessed about even minimal dps gains, and they need to be. I'm not sure we can ever balance all 3 specs of a given class to be within 100 or so dps of each other on the most challenging content given that the specs have different mechanics that produce different strengths and weaknesses on different encounters. Balance at the hardest of the hard core is different from balance at the rest of the game, and much of the community would do well to focus less on maximum dps potential with the best gear and focus more on what they themselves can do. BM in 3.3.2 was unacceptably low in PvE. I'm not sure it is now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767539635-bm-hunters-still-need-help.html))<br />

Threat and Rage Management<br />
I think they are different though. You are probably not going to die from failing to push Shield Slam, except possibly to a raid wipe very early on the pull when threat is dicey and healers or casters get creamed (and today, even that is unlikely.) The other problem is the resource issue I mentioned before. Back in BC (especially early), warriors had to prioritize rage a little more. If you hit Heroic Strike so much that you lacked rage for a Shield Slam (or a Shield Block), then you were doing it wrong. In today's environment, many Prot warriors might as well take the rage bar off their screen. (Caveat: This does not mean being eternally rage starved is fun. It just means that choosing which ability to use is more fun than hitting them on cooldown.)

Like, what the hell is Survival anyway? Back before the overhaul(s) it was some kind of hilariously crappy Trap/Melee (lawl) tree with Wyvern Sting to piss people off in PvP.<br />
It's not a Pet tree and it's not a Ranged tree, it wins because of Lock n Load, passive stat boosts and Explosive Shit.<br />
It ignores pets entirely, other than having a Wolf for Furious Howl.<br />
<br />
Marksman atleast was a proper tree, it enhances your ranged attacks, and not increases passive stats or pure damage done in % like Surv does (Expose Weakness, Sniper Training, Hunter vs. Wild)<br />
<br />
Left in the gutter is Beastmastery because it dominated in BC since it could be macroed (Kill Command and Steady Shot, more or less.), and now it's locked in a bad place because the theme of the tree, pets, conflicts with Blizzard's total unacceptance of the hunters damage being made by the pet. It's a fair concern, but what could be done?<br />
Beast Mastery (51 point): Your damaging ranged attacks has a 15-20% chance of causing your Pet to grant both the Hunter and Pet 3% of total AP, stacks up to 5 times.<br />
or maybe;<br />
Kindred Spirits: While your pet is alive and summoned, you gain 10% ranged Haste.<br />
There's many ways to allow BM to &quot;stack up&quot;, thus making buffs have a lower inpact on PvP.<br />
<br />
I see BM as THE true Hunter tree... problem is that as a Beastmaster tree, almost all of the talents are pet oriented, thus creating the problem with a too large amount of their total damage are from a Pet autoattacking, not to mention the drop in damage if the pet dies.<br />
Yet, pets are an essential part of the hunter class, but MM and Surv degrades them to passive buff-bots, and there's not a too significant problem if the pet dies for those two speccs.<br />
<br />
Do I want BM to dominate like in BC? No...<br />
But it should be closer x_x</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe this is true in some cases. But what about all the normal dungeons that are being facerolled with AoE? I just leveled a paladin and in the, maybe 50, normal runs i did while leveling there was never any use of CC. <br />
And i clearly remember doing heroics with Black Temple gear and quest items with my friend tanking and me healing. We didn't use a lot of CC, maybe on 3 pulls of all the heroics. Yes, sometimes it was a little hard to heal and new players would probably wipe there.<br />
<br />
In TBC when i did heroic dungeons in T4 gear (you can compare that to having naxx gear and doing heroics in WotLK) we still used CC. <br />
It's the 3.0 WotLK skills, talents and new mechanics that made dungeons AoE fests. Not &quot;some&quot; of it was overgearing. We ran Black Temple in the same gear as before but now AoEing everything, after 3.0 hit.<br />
<br />
Yes, when you go to an ilvl 200 dungeon with ilvl 264 you are overgearing it. But that's Blizzard's fault, giving frost emblems from heroics.</div></div><hr />

Sure, Hex sucks... but only because of the cool down.<br />

I remember back in vanilla... taking 45 mins to run Scarlet Monastery: Cathedral and needing to make sure i kept sheep up (instead of just casting it and forgetting about it).<br />
<br />
Seriously, i feel like the people i play this game with would find Wack-A-Mole too difficult and &quot;mathy&quot;.<br />

Crowd Control is a necessary componant of the game. Wotlk has proven that without CC... idiots run rampant.<br />

<br />
<br />
Yes, only with a prot paladin. So giving all tanks ridiculous threat and AoE abilities ruined CC and dumbed everything down.<br />
<br />
If you would tank 5 mobs as a warrior in TBC you even had a chance the healer would pull agro.<br />
Threat dropping skills were actually used. Also on single target boss fights. You needed Blessing of Salvation to increase dps (maybe that was a little bit wrong, but oke).<br />
<br />
I remember doing The Shattered Halls with my friend. He was tanking on his warrior and i was healing on my shaman. We were in T4+ gear. You had these huge (for those times, 5 mobs) packs where i actually had to wait with healing or i would pull threat on one of those mobs he didn't have a chance to hit yet. Or you used sap (probably one of the skills a rogue almost never uses these days in pve) and sheep.<br />
I think the duration of sap was even increased. Before that the tank actually had to watch when sap was falling of and pick up the mob and the mage had to resheep his target.<br />
<br />
I understand why they changed these things, but i think it still was more fun in TBC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with this reasoning imo is that specs which are easier to play than others and still push out more dps will be the specs of choice/ no way around it. The smaller your gap in dps between specs is ( to which i think you still should aspire )the more viable the other specs become- harder to pay specs/ specs with a very common raidbuff should be slightly higher on dps imo , because otherwise they'll never be viable. People not being as extremely good as players in those top guilds wil still be pushed into those top dmg specs because either: <br />
1. Usually they are easier to play than their counterparts<br />
2. Usually they pack a more valuable raidbuff than their lower counterparts<br />
<br />
I don't want to generalise because in some cases a good job balancing was done, i think of for example warocks, but in some cases a horrible job is still keeping people in only 1 raidspec-&gt;mages/ Deat knights. all i wnat to say is , don't stop balancing specs becasue they are a 'mere 2k dps' apart</div></div><hr />

Hunter specs in 3.3.3<br />
Let's assume BM and SV are 1500-2000 dps behind MM<br />
It amazes me that GC thinks this is acceptable. If I'm testing my dps and discover that the spec I love is 500 dps behind the spec I don't particularly like I'll make my enjoyed spec my offspec and keep trying to improve it while raiding as whatever does the most dps. If the difference is 1000 or more outside of a raid then I'd never consider taking it in unless it was severely &quot;on farm&quot;. 1500-2000 is totally unacceptable and I would never let my entire raid down by gimping my dps that much no matter how much I loved the spec.</div></div><hr />

There can be something in between Heroic Shadow Labs when it shipped and Heroic Nexus today in your 251 / 264 gear. Stopping to crowd control some of the pulls isn't so terribly onerous, given that the dungeons themselves are a lot shorter than they were in the day when Scholomance was serious business.<br />
<br />
I'll still argue some (but not all) of it was the gear. Naxx was available immediately and relatively undertuned, especially in the 25 player version. In BC I spent a lot of time finishing up all of those Shadowmoon quests with blue rewards so that I could handle Karazhan. In Lich King many of us were in Naxx before we saw some of the heroic dungeons. By the time we got back to those dungeons, we totally overgeared them.<br />
<br />
Heroic Halls of Reflection isn't a great example because of the nature of the first room, but if you look at something like Heroic Pit of Saron, that dungeon took a bit of learning before it was a milk run. The pulls before the tunnel at the end typically require crowd control until you overgear it with raid drops and Frost badge gear.<br />
How can a someone working for the company that designs the whole freaking game say something like that?<br />
<br />
If you make (raid-)content so easy and hand out so much good gear in a very short time-frame then you have to tune your content accordingly. Its not like the loot is falling from the sky and your content-developers don´t know nothing about it. And apart from that, you could AoE through all the dungeons in quest-gear if you had a little skill left from TBC.<br />
<br />
Pit of Saron is a cakewalk if one of the five players kows how to interrupt an AoE-cast channeled by the mobs. But you know, only 1 out of 20 players knows how to do this - the rest got used to your stupid AoE-bombing content.</div></div><hr />

I think that was his point. Although, I have to say that this particular piece of art is no better than the goofy over-sized breasts you normally see. She looks like she has individual pockets sewn into her armor and tabard for them. It's kinda silly and unnatural looking. Breasts force the entire front of a woman's clothes forward, with maybe a slight valley in between them depending on the woman's build and how tight the clothes are. Those look like they're cloth breasts glued onto her tabard after the fact. They even cover the line of tabard at one point.</div></div><hr />

Kindred Spirits: While your pet is alive and summoned, you gain 10% ranged Haste.<br />
There's many ways to allow BM to &quot;stack up&quot;, thus making buffs have a lower inpact on PvP.<br />
<br />
I see BM as THE true Hunter tree... problem is that as a Beastmaster tree, almost all of the talents are pet oriented, thus creating the problem with a too large amount of their total damage are from a Pet autoattacking, not to mention the drop in damage if the pet dies.<br />
Yet, pets are an essential part of the hunter class, but MM and Surv degrades them to passive buff-bots, and there's not a too significant problem if the pet dies for those two speccs.<br />
<br />
Do I want BM to dominate like in BC? No...<br />
But it should be closer x_x<br />
<br />
<br />
All of this, +1. I'm more of Marksman guy myself :).</div></div><hr />

Boub please do it justice (I'm sure you will).. sure post the world first 25man kill which most people are agreeing will be with the buff in some form or another BUT PLEASE dont forget to keep an eye out for the no buff kill. That is the hardest fight in the game at the moment and should be given the recognition it deserves.</div></div><hr />

Improvements of WotLK:<br />
- faster levelling<br />
- CC made not as necessary<br />
- heroics are, generally, easier<br />
- raids are more accessible to the majority<br />
- new heroic brought out with new tiers of content (so that they could make harder heroics)<br />
<br />
Failures of WotLK<br />
- CC was made redundant in PvE (planning for trash or having to handle it a little differently to &quot;group up and AoE shiz&quot; broke up the monotony of having to kill trash in the first place. No trash = dull as hell, ToC proved that)<br />
- the majority of normal mode raids were made too easy (there's nothing wrong with casual players killing bosses, there is something wrong with players who have no idea whatsoever about how to play their class killing bosses)<br />

Simply put, Their biggest fumble in wrath, among what you stated above, was they're emblem systems (yeah plural.. cause they changed so damn many times). I don't mean gear scaling, though that was a side effect of their systems. You should not be able to get ilevel 232 gear having done nothing but heroics. Why would any idiot ever want to run naxx or ulduar if they can put in way less effort and get FAR better gear. Making content useless to run is no better than removing content from the game, since both situations leave much less content for players to experience. WotLK became LESS of a game than even BC, and especially vanilla.</div></div><hr />

I hate that as much as you do, but it's the only way blizzard can think of to get people up to the current story fast. They seem to think that all content is redundant if it isn't current.<br />
The downside, from their perspective is that there may just not be anyone doing the tier of content you need to do. If there isn't you're pretty much stuck like you were in TBC. I'd prefer it if people had to progress through tiers of content in order to get to the current tier because it made it feel a lot more like you earned it back in TBC (and I was fine with spending months in SSC / TK) but blizzard apparently disagrees.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blacktempest</div><div class="date">2010-03-20, 05:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two points of view:<br />
<br />
1) Gearing new players for your guild. Under the Wrath system, if you lose a member, you can quickly get him geared in few days. Under BC, this could well take over a month and force members to farm old content for the sole purpose of gearing new people. While this does mean that everyone gets to see all the content on the low end, it often means many will never see the top end. People who prefer this system tend to be on the low end and spend less time on the game or those who took a leave of absence from the game and want to return to form.<br />
<br />
2) Epic feel of the game. Many people believe that it should be hard. That people who take the time to conquer all the content should have the best gear instead of people who showed up late for the party and cruised into a raid spot. These people also feel that battlegrounds should be rated and only highly rated ones should have access to decent gear. Generally these people are the ones who already have the gear and have never took a leave of absence from the game.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with #2 is: The average player will never see the majority of content. The biggest problem with #1 is: everyone can get awesome gear if they put in 10 hours a week without stepping foot in a raid.<br />
<br />
My preferred solution: The badge system shouldn't have Tier loot on it. Top badges are only available through 10 man and 25 man raids. Heroics drop secondary badges. Top badges can buy armor and weapons. Secondary badges drop rings, trinkets, and relic slot items.<br />
<br />
If you need to gear a new member, you do the 10 man version of Naxx and down all the bosses. He gets some naxx level gear and two pieces of top badge stuff. Run Ulduar and he gets some upgrades and two more. You get the idea. The higher the tier, the faster you can gear up if you are willing to spend the time to kill every raid boss available.<br />
<br />
You always have the option to do battlegrounds although top tier stuff is arena, secondary tier is rated BG, and third tier is no requirement.<br />
<br />
These changes would give people incentives to raid. They would see all the content. People go into Heroics to get relic slot every tier so there is incentive to go there. The quest awards an additional badge so you can get it faster. To gear up newer players, they still need to raid but they don't need to farm that much. You can make the badge stuff better if it drops off of raid bosses. The best itemized items and best ilvl are all hard mode just like now.<br />
<br />
These are my opinions. It makes it harder than now to gear up a new player but easier than most of BC (before badges came out). It does force raiders to do Heroics between raids but the badge requirement should be small and not too grindy.</div></div><hr />

This attitude, which is currently unavoidable, will cut out everyone who isn't already in a raiding guild and forces people to pug in the WotLK system (whether successful or not).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Second</div><div class="date">2010-03-20, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly. Imagine i cant raid (for example) 3 days a week 20-22. I cant get the raid loot and i am stucked in heroics.<br />
Now WITHOUT the badge system in place, i would be done with game - i could farm heroics, and that would be it. I could probably raid from time to time to get the new loot but guys raiding from day one or just being able to raid 3 days a week would soon be elsewhere in content. No chance of getting back, cos i was slow. Now maybe i exagerate here but this is majority of players (or imagine its like 60% or something) - those are done with the game cos scissor gap just opens wider. Thats why (imo) badge system kicks in to a) have new guys easily geared b) have content for guys who would else be done with game so keeping your playerbase for whole expansion pack.<br />
I am pretty sure everyone had the &quot;why are we farming 3 month old content when we should be progressing in elsewhere&quot; moment in BC.</div></div><hr />

I am pretty sure everyone had the &quot;why are we farming 3 month old content when we should be progressing in elsewhere&quot; moment in BC.<br />
So a badge / emblem system of some kind is required for people who don't have a lot of time (I'm not sure what to think about not being able to commit 6 hours a week regularly when many people commit 40+ hours regularly to their jobs) but it still needs balancing. Personally I'd much prefer a model where at some level people still need to see all the expansion's content in order to see the current content, even if it was an account-wide system (e.g. if you've done naxx once on your account you can go to ulduar, and so on).</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a reason to why they abandoned the old design.<br />
Remember in classic WoW, when AQ was on farm (late 1.9/1.10, Naxxramas was released in 1.11) or even later. How could anyone ever catch up? There your preferred system was active. A new 60 was forced to go, roughly:<br />
Endless faction grind for some decent rares --&gt; late BRD/Scholo/Strat 500 times --&gt; LBRS --&gt; ZG farm for 2 months --&gt; AQ20 --&gt; MC --&gt; BWL. Each of the raid steps could take months due to shitty itemized loot and low drops per boss, not to mention the oh-so amusing task of spending more time farming Nature and Fire res gear than actually raiding.<br />
You might have forgotten how lovely it was to run 20 man raids with 3~ blue drops per boss, or 4~ epics per boss in a 40 man, but I haven't. Gearing up took ages, and was pretty much the only reason to why progression took so f'ing long in classic WoW. It was due to poor design, not difficulty or complex bossfights if that's what you're trying to tell yourself.<br />
<br />
In BC, although the progression was a bit easier, guilds were still forced to run people through SSC and TK for ages (as in, every time they had a new guildmember) just to get them into Black Temple..<br />
<br />
* Neutral [70] The Secret Compromised Seer Olum spawns in Serpentshrine Cavern after slaying Fathom-Lord Karathress. <br />
* Neutral [70R] Ruse of the Ashtongue Travel into Tempest Keep and slay Al'ar while wearing the Ashtongue Cowl. <br />
* Neutral [70R] An Artifact From the Past Go to the Caverns of Time in Tanaris and gain access to the Battle for Mount Hyjal. Once inside, defeat Rage Winterchill.<br />
<br />
Now, since raid tiers progress, in order to avoid the TERRIBLE DESIGN FLAW of forcing every new max-level player to farm the oldest, most trivial of content, we're given emblems to pass trivial content no one even cares about anymore. That's apparently the best design, and thus they should stick to it.<br />
It's the same in the PvP system, every season those who play mostly battlegrounds (in PvE this would be 5mans) can get a 2 season old PvP set, right now it's Relentless and some Wrathfull pieces. In PvE you can get iLevel 232 (old..) by farming 5mans, and occasional 245.<br />
Or maybe you'd think it'd be great to gear up in ilevel 200, 213, 219, 232, 239, 245, 251.. all the way up to 284.<br />
Yeah, how horrible how we're able to get 219(Valor/Conquest?)/232(Triumph) 17 months after release.<br />
<br />
Geez.<br />
<br />
Even though I can agree that quite a bit content is being made trivial, ask yourself, is that not to expect when WotLK has been live for 17 months?! You want to return to Naxx for the lulz, or have the means of catching up on the actual (relatively) current raids in a reasonable time? I think the answer is obvious, and apparently Blizzard agrees.<br />
<br />
The new raid design might have it's flaws, but it sure is a lot better than that old piece of shit design we once had.</div></div><hr />

No, but they'd make the game less fun for more players while not exactly making it better for the rest.<br />
They also care about making a good game, and a loot system excluding everyone that isn't raiding hardcore is just bad.</div></div><hr />

I like attunements, because it felt more like you'd earned your way into the raid, but I agree that having to take so long for a new players is an issue. I think a fair compromise would be guild attunements.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even though I can agree that quite a bit content is being made trivial, ask yourself, is that not to expect when WotLK has been live for 17 months?! <br />
... no.<br />
Vanilla content should be trivial.<br />
TBC content should be trivial.<br />
WotLK heroics should be trivial.<br />
All WotLK raiding content should still be treated as current.<br />
<br />
<br />
You want to return to Naxx for the lulz, or have the means of catching up on the actual (relatively) current raids in a reasonable time? I think the answer is obvious, and apparently Blizzard agrees.<br />
I think that people who hit 80 on their first character should have to raid naxx / os / eoe / ulduar level for a week (minimum), then toc / onyxia level for a week (minimum), then icc. They should not be able to spam heroics for a weekend then have the gear to walk into icc without ever having done a raid. If they then levelled up another 80 after doing level 1 content and level 2 content on a character on their account then they could spam heroics and walk into icc.<br />
<br />
<br />
The new raid design might have it's flaws, but it sure is a lot better than that old piece of shit design we once had.<br />
Vanilla was too harsh by far, TBC was too harsh only due to the emblem system giving useless or overpowered loot, and the WotLK system makes things too easy from my perspective. A balance needs to be found.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
agree with you but if they make gearing harder then no one would paly<br />
you know blizz care about money<br />
11 million people currently play WoW. People who like stupidly easy epics are a very small proportion of that. If they went I doubt it'd be noticable.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gamerunknown</div><div class="date">2010-03-21, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm beginning to think that some of the people complaining about the game being too easy wish to validate their sense of entitlement towards downing content and want to differentiate themselves from other players. I'll admit that I'm biased myself: I started playing towards late BC and despite the addition of the badge system, found it very difficult to enter raids as everyone wanted massively geared players for badge runs... Not extremely different from now. A player shouldn't be penalised if they demonstrate an aptitude for their class based on which point they enter the game and they should have an opportunity to enter the content in order to apply their skill at the class. <br />
<br />
As for the use of CC, an excellent rogue I know pointed out that it was just as prevalent and equally useless as GearScore during tBC: back then, you were declined based on your class not having any form of CC (or as he was, on having a form of CC which cannot be applied in combat). While there was less emphasis on dps in heroics from what I can recall, sheeping two mobs and single target dpsing one of them is just as trivial and repetitive as AoEing the rest of them down. Just as with the changes to Anomalus, a fight isn't harder just because it is longer. The only solution to some classes not having appropriate CC if dungeons were tuned around them would be homogenisation, which would obviously take away from the individuality of a class. If AoEing becomes repetitive, they could make threat a component, though this would probably be with the hassle of RNG... and to be frank, there's really no reason for non current content to induce stress once the tactics are learnt. <br />
<br />
Another issue with CC is that as a healer, its often more dangerous to attempt it than to not. For the pull in PoS I'd have loved to shackle, but any mobs that didn't have AoE threat on them would have almost certainly gone for me. Conversely, if the tank missed grabbed most mobs except one and it started casting at a ranged, CC tended to work. Since some of them were casters and there was a greater chance I'd miss than for the hit capped dpsers, trying to shackle and have the rest of the group come towards me (for the tank to pick up) would be a nightmare. Far better to pump out the extra healing required with much less chance of a wipe and just drink between pulls.</div></div><hr />

This seems like a VERY good idea. I think it could fix a lot of issues. Good call!<br />

They should not be able to spam heroics for a weekend then have the gear to walk into icc without ever having done a raid.

<br />
Content is, and always will be easier the second time around, especially if it isn't max tier content. Two reasons:<br />
A) Whether you're pugging or in a raiding and/or progression guild, the members of the group are going to overall have a much higher average ilevel (compared to a group in present progression content), making the stats component of bosses easier, and on that same note, more players are likely to have experienced it, making each encounter much easier.<br />
B) Wrath added the heroic AND 10/25 raid options. an Example of how this makes the second time 'round better (more so in cataclysm when even the first few raids will have that option. naxx and ulduar were a little gimped because they had no 'heroic') This gives you far more options on how you want to gear up, therefore, though it might be painful, it should be much more fun, if not at least interesting to gear. I'll make up an example, though fabricated with no names: (i'll use wrath ilevels, just cause those are what i know...)<br />
<br />
ilevel 200<br />
Heroic Instances<br />
Raid Tier#1 - 10<br />
<br />
ilevel 213<br />
Raid Tier#1 - 25<br />
Raid Tier#1 - 10h<br />
Raid Tier#2 - 10<br />
<br />
ilevel 219<br />
Raid Tier#2 - 25<br />
Raid Tier#2 - 10h<br />
Raid Tier#3 - 10<br />
<br />
You get the idea. Rince and repeat till the end of the expansion. My point is that this was pretty much what it was like in the past. (once again a fabrication, but just to prove a point)<br />
<br />
ilevel 200<br />
Heroics<br />
Raid Tier#1<br />
<br />
ilevel 213<br />
Raid Tier#2<br />
<br />
ilevel 219<br />
Raid Tier#3<br />
<br />
...much less interesting. Just to clarify, by &quot;Raid Tier#X&quot;, i just mean all the instances released in that content patch/for that difficulty level. so naxx, eoe, os would all be tier 1, ulduar tier 2, etc... This prolly went on too long, and i decided to ignore the badges because that, if anything removes incentive to experience the content if someone can just run heroics non stop to get the same gear. that's just a whole other issue, and i'm trying to emphasize something i think they did right for wrath for more than the immediately apparent reasons.</div></div><hr />
