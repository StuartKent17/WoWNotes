<br />
Beta Experience Required to Level Changed<br />
The amount of experience required to level changed recently in beta, decreasing for a portion of leveling under 85 and significantly increasing with level 85 and onward. See the table below for a rough idea of the changes. <br />
<br />
Due to the lack of people leveling in beta, it was hard to get data for some of the level ranges. If you happen to have a character in the questionable level range, be sure to check and let us know what you find!<br />
<br />
You can get a good idea of the XP rewarded by the new quests by glancing over the various Zone Pages on WoWDB (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/pandaria).<br />

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
Character Creation Preview Gear Updated<br />
The latest beta build added shoulders to some of the new gear used in the preview when selecting a class during character creation. This is not the gear that your character will get when starting the game, but the gear that is used to show you what a higher level character will look like. You can find the sets that were not updated in our original post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2873-Legendary-Questline-Update-Character-Creation-Gear-Blue-Posts-Weekly-Roundup).<br />

<br />
Beta Class Balance Analysis<br />
We are changing the new Vengeance model to work on unmitigated damage. This means the number is calculated without regards to armor, stance, cooldowns, etc. The net result is that any given creature should generate the same average Vengeance for all tanks. The conversion has been reduced from 5% to 2% to adjust for this change. (This is not yet on your current build.)<br />
<br />
concerning &quot;imortal' buffs (such as Guardian Angel, Ardent Defender) and cooldowns that allow the tank to soak an amount of dmg that would otherwise kill him (Zen Meditation, AMS) .. <br />
<br />
how those would affect vengeance? <br />
<br />
a) are the &quot;entire dmg&quot; used in the calculation? for example the boss skill does 999k dmg, but we are able to survive that with that kind of cooldown, does it account for that 999k dmg taken, skyrocketing vengeance to heavens ? <br />
<br />
b) only the dmg taken is used on the calculation? for example, the tank with 500k hp will take 500k dmg, but the cd/buff prevents his death, and the extra dmg (that is absorbed by the cooldown) is not accounted on the vengeance?<br />
<br />
c) while using that kind of cooldown any dmg taken will not account on vengeance? <br />
We're not entirely sure yet of the right call here. You could theoretically dump all your survival cooldowns in order to give your tank an AP buff. Maybe that's not worth it, or maybe it's an interesting decision to help you get through the hard phase of a fight. Obviously we wouldn't want survival cooldowns to no longer be used for survival, but I suspect that won't be the case. Try and abuse it and let us know what you find.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to point out that for guardians and blood dks that the vengeance tooltip was not updated with the removal of the 10% max health cap. The new model is in just need the tooltip update.<br />
We just overlooked that tooltip and it is now fixed. There is no cap for any tank at this time.<br />
<br />
Just confirming that with the new model, our starting jump up Vengeance (to prevent long ramp up) is: (UnmitigatedHit/3.75) * 50%<br />
Yeah, that calculation should work.<br />
<br />
Have you ever considered adding a buff to heal spec DPS that is only active while the healer is not in a group/raid? Probably the same could be asked for tank specs. Then those players are not forced into a DPS spec or slower gameplay while out grinding and questing.<br />
The advantage of tanking when solo is supposed to be that you are very hard to kill. It's a common solo tank tactic just to pull lots of stuff at once. Similarly, healers also don't die. They might not be able to kill something in 3 GCDs, but it shouldn't take 12 either, and then they can throw a heal on themselves and go on to the next pull.<br />
<br />
We don't want tanks and healers to do dreadful DPS when solo, and to be fair, I don't think they do. But we also don't want to see leveling guides encouraging Ret paladins or Shadow priests to swap specs just for leveling purposes.<br />
<br />
I leveled a Resto druid as Resto through LK, and I could nuke stuff down just fine. The problems I had were with say spellcasters because I couldn't interrupt them. NPCs who could heal just kept healing themselves until they ran OOM.<br />
<br />
If anyone feels like their healing or tanking character in the current beta build would have a lot of trouble leveling or completing daily quests while solo, please let us know.<br />
<br />
Earlier, you mentioned that swing speeds slow down dynamically if an attack speed buff expires mid-swing. Does this also apply to temporary haste rating effects (say, a trinket proc or the elemental blast buff)? Do swings also speed up dynamically if you gain an appropriate buff mid-swing?<br />
Yes to all of these.<br />

There appears to be a serious problem with DK rune regeneration in the current build. Our apologies. We will work on a solution as soon as we can.<br />

I'm noticing that the damage on improved serpent sting seems to not match a logical formula since the patch hit. The best fit I can find to explain it is that it may be using the old serpent sting formula (9.7% RAP + 2030.22) instead of the new one (8% RAP + 1620.19). Applying that and the 100% bonus from the ability description gets me within a few damage of the expected amount, but it's still slightly off. <br />
<br />
I can't imagine this is correct, but I was hoping you could clarify if it's a bug or if the mechanics have changed and the tooltip wasn't updated. I'm getting 12615 damage from imp sting with 18528 RAP and 9.84% mastery (and no debuffs on the target).<br />
It was indeed using the old formula for Serpent Sting’s damage in Improved Serpent Sting. This has been fixed for the next build.<br />
<br />
Is wild quiver proc'd when ranged attacks cast? or when they impact the target? (on cast)<br />
When the attack successfully hits.<br />
<br />
Can wild quiver proc from an attack that misses or is dodged? (yes)<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Does a wild quiver shot qualify as a ranged attach that could recursively proc another wild quiver shot? (I would think so from the tooltip)<br />
No, it can’t proc from attacks that are procs themselves.<br />
<br />
Do non-bow attacks (e.g., trinket procs) trigger wild quiver? (no)<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Is murder of crows supposed to trigger wild quiver? (I thought yes but it doesn't)<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler look at these numbers http://www.simulationcraft.org/504/Raid_T14H.html<br />
I think you guys kinda overshot hunter nerfs a lil don't you think? We went from being up top with Boomies and Demo locks before the nerf/patch to dead last now.<br />
I can't debug the Simulationcraft numbers. Those guys are working very hard from what we can tell to be as accurate as possible, but when they're not, I am unable to give you explanations without a lot more information.<br />
<br />
If you have some raid parses or something else showing hunters on the bottom, we could discuss those.<br />

Is Elusive Brew on your radar? I haven't crunched the numbers but I just KNOW everyone's going to be surprised when they see how much more effective it is when you use each charge as you get them.<br />
<br />
At first glance, everyone wants to use it like Tigereye Brew (wait till high/max stacks, use it for the burst damage), but I'm theorizing that sipping it like Mana Tea suddenly converts it into a Savage Defense clone given the rate of charges that we can gain. If we time it, we can spend the charges as we gain them (1 or 2 at a time depending on how many Elusive Brew procs) on individual melee swings, greatly improving its effectiveness in a way that probably wasn't counted on considering its previous version.<br />
You might not have the recent change yet, where we added a 9 sec self-only cooldown to the Elusive Brew button. It is still off the GCD.<br />

Could we get Sacred Shield to stack?<br />
Yes, it will stack from multiple paladins. It is still limit one per paladin.<br />
<br />
Can Sanctity of Battle affect Avenger Shield?<br />
Yes.<br />

Recuperate does not seem to be benefiting from PvP power.<br />
Percentage health increases shouldn't benefit from PvP power, since they already scale with your health pool. They were doing this in an earlier build, but we have since fixed it.<br />
<br />

Is there a possibility you can look at giving the same treatment to Earth Shield? If you are going to allow multiple Sacred Shields on a single target, (in addition to much earlier making a similar change for Beacon and Lifebloom, etc) what is the reason Earth Shield is still limited?<br />
We'll discuss it, but Earth Shield is really powerful.<br />
<br />
I am 99% sure healing stream and Healing tide in some way or bugged. Before the bug where they where not geting the + 50% to water totem's they were healing for more then they are now after it was fixed. Seem's like either only geting 25% of the water totem buff or not geting the 25% to shaman heal's buff..<br />
No, you're right. It wasn’t getting the buff to all healing. Fixed.<br />
<br />
Elemental Blast tooltip and intention claims 3,500 yet the buff and actual gain is still 3,000 Haste/Mastery or Crit.<br />
It is intended to be 3500. We can look into hotfixing it depending on when the next build will go out.<br />
<br />
Healing Rain is currently gaining the buff from Unleashed Elements. Is this a bug?<br />
No, that is intended.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock))<br />
A note for Demonology warlocks: There’s a bug in the current beta build which is preventing your Metamorphosis Melee from casting while casting other spells. You should still be able to do that, and it will be fixed for the next build.<br />
<br />
So what's going on with Shadow Bolt? The damage it's doing isn't meshing with the spell's tooltip, or what I should be seeing when I math it all out based on my stats, and the damage it's doing is oddly consistent (26,723 to 26,724 with my current stats).<br />
Yeah, the tooltip was wrong. Fixed for the next build.<br />
<br />
Destruction Warlocks are once again non competitive and it seems every expansion you try and bandage fix their dps later on and it still doesn't work out. Simulationcraft has they WAY behind not other lock specs but other classes in general. Now you would think hey not every fight is standstill perhaps they will do more on multitarget or aoe fights but.......WAY behind demo and other classes there too. We've had to deal with rain of fire (aka rain of fail) for our aoe now and there still isn't a good aoe option competitively. <br />
<br />
Now before you say: hey on single target what if you move your spec might be better there but NOPE; destro is a nuke class and benefits least from moving around. Thus this spec has no use for ANY situation over ANY lock spec. It needs a serious fix now.<br />
I can't debug the Simulationcraft numbers. Those guys are working very hard from what we can tell to be as accurate as possible, but when they're not, I am unable to give you explanations without a lot more information.<br />
<br />
If you have some raid parses or something else showing [your dude] on the bottom, we could discuss those.<br />
<br />
Also, see the excellent post above by Lokrick. Don't hold up Simcraft or any theorycrafting to unrealistic expectations. Channel your energy towards helping those guys instead. Do their numbers match what your character can achieve? Do you see anything wrong with their assumptions or calculations? Just telling us that Simcraft says you are low isn't conveying any actual information to us.<br />
<br />
I am afraid &quot;posts Simcraft and pouts&quot; posts are going to be added to our drinking game. <br />
<br />
Fel flame is really expensive that it sometimes because a struggle to even weave it into our rotation. As many have said in the past, is there any possibility to bring down the cost of fel flame a little so it won't seem so painful to cast.... especially when we are low on manner.<br />
Fel Flame isn't intended to be part of your single-target, stand and nuke rotation. It's for movement or quick kills.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior))<br />
Is enrages while enraged not proc'ing more charges of Raging Blows intended?<br />
<br />
It is for the moment at least, but we're not crazy about it. Specifically, using Berserker Rage while Enrage is up doesn't give you more rage or Raging Blow charges. The concern was that Fury would just macro Berserker Rage into every attack. With the previous design, this wasn't worth doing because once you were enraged being more enraged wasn't valuable. Now it is. It's more intuitive (and probably fun) if Berserker Rage always grants a charge, but we want Berserker Rage to be a button warriors actually use, not macro. Another option would be to put Berseker Rage on the GCD, but we thought this would feel even worse. If we become convinced warriors won't macro Berserker Rage, we'll happily revert the change.<br />
<br />
Enough smart players have stepped up to the plate to convince us that this probably won't be a problem (in other words, that you could macro Berserker Rage but optimal play is not to), so we are going to revert this change. Berserker Rage will grant a charge of Raging Blow and rage even if you are already enraged.<br />
<br />
As an aside, we are also going to try warrior stances off the GCD again, but with a 3 sec shared cooldown. This should allow you to shift stances for short periods without a damage loss because of the spent GCD, but not for individual attacks.<br />
<br />

Recent Vengeance Changes<br />
We don't want tanks to do awesome damage just for being tanks. We want tanks to do awesome damage when they are actually tanking. That remains the governing philosophy behind the design. <br />
<br />
Remember, Vengeance doesn't exist to give tanks something fun to do. It exists solely to make sure tank threat stays high when DPS characters are gearing for higher DPS while the tanks gear primarily for survival. Tanks only need to generate high threat when they are tanking, and typically threat is the most important on the most dangerous opponents, which also tend to be those who hit the hardest. <br />
<br />
As an aside, if I was able to design WoW solely for me, threat would still be an important stat to gear for. Raiders would scoff at tanks who stacked only Stamina as being bad tanks because they couldn't hold aggro. It was fun for me back in BWL to try to generate higher threat than the warlocks. I don't think it was that fun for the warlocks though. I don't think it was that fun for the rest of the raid when I screwed up e.g. my Heroic Strike use and caused us to wipe without them feeling like they could do anything to resolve the situation except stop DPS. Fortunately, I recognize that WoW would have far fewer players if I got to design it totally around what I find fun.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if your successful Taunt granted some Vengeance.<br />
We're toying with that idea. It would be a percent of Vengeance of the character you taunted off of, not just free AP.<br />
<br />
The scenario we want to avoid is Tank A is tanking, and Tank B taunts off, but then avoids three boss hits in a row. The boss is likely to go back to Tank A. The avoidance wouldn't be a problem if it came later on, because we average things out, but if it happens early on, we have nothing to average.<br />
<br />
You could have solved that if you just gave everyone threat drops. Why would that have been such a problem? Even now I run into bad thanks that can't hold threat off my Warrior or DK, and I have to sit there doing nothing because one special attack will rip threat.<br />
I don't think that really solves the problem. If dumping your cooldown regularly was necessary then it would almost become part of your DPS rotation which doesn't seem like it's adding much gameplay. If dumping your cooldown was something you only did when the boss turned to attack you, then it would still be really sub-optimal to have the boss always bolting around, cleaving, breathing or whatever else to the group. I think you'd still just want to keep the boss on the tank and have the raid do slow DPS.<br />
<br />
And lastly, Threat being fun back in Vanilla (and it was) was only possible because the dungeons required you to understand and react to it.<br />
I'm not sure it was fun in vanilla. It was fun for me because I was a tank. I see mostly tanks say it was fun. I haven't seen too many DPS players say it was fun to try not to do so much DPS that they caught up with the tank.<br />
<br />
I know &quot;scaling&quot; is the fall guy for just about anything, and it's the most over (and wrongly) used word on the forums...<br />
Totally agree with that. The rest of your post was good too, but I believe we have fixed the differing mitigation problem.<br />
<br />
I think I started writing a reply to the Vengeance topic earlier, but I deleted it. Just didn't seem like my voice would matter, because I'm fairly sure I come down on the opposite side of Blizz in regard to the topic of Tank damage. My feeling is low Tank damage is one of the contributing factors to the insufficient Tank supply and that many Tanks would enjoy doing much higher damage.<br />
&quot;Every voice matters.&quot; I disagree with you a little about tank shortage. I think it is almost entirely because tanks have a lot of responsibility to set the pace of things, know the boss mechanics and often even have to explain them to others.<br />
<br />
This game has spectacular framework and is bar none the best game I have played, however sometimes I feel like you really don't understand what we find fun.<br />
A little off topic, but I would argue that perhaps you don't realize that some players find fun things that you don't find fun.<br />
<br />
1) Tanks need a way to scale up their threat output as DPS gear up into threat stats only while tanks take primarily defensive stats (even in this new active mitigation model it seems).<br />
<br />
2) The current versions of vengence on both live and beta have similar problems and quirks that make it &quot;not fun&quot; to quest in a tank spec, or to have to deal with tank swaps.<br />
<br />
One hundred percent agree that point 1 is important. That was the genesis of Vengeance. We don't think tanks need high damage in order for questing to be fun, and you can even argue that it's not important for tanks to be good at questing. (I'm not arguing that specifically, but I don't think it's a hard argument to make.)

Upcoming Beta Hotfixes<br />
Update on this issue: We'll be applying a hotfix overnight that should fix the Death Knight rune regen issues, and also should address the odd &quot;phasing&quot; issues that were present throughout testing today.

Launcher Now Downloading Data For MoP Update<br />
I'm just popping in here to confirm that the background download for Mists of Pandaria content has begun. It's like September 25 is getting closer every day... (!)<br />
<br />
By the way, answers to a lot of common questions about the Blizzard Background Downloader can be found here: http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/blizzard-background-downloader-faq<br />
<br />
It's a good read for troubleshooting and general information.<br />
<br />
any info as to the end of the pvp season ?<br />

Mists Of Pandaria Leveling Speed<br />
FYI, instance leveling is very very slow compared to questing, so much so there has been numerous amounts submitting bug / feedback reports regarding the XP gained.<br />
The developers haven't done yet the final pass on experience balance for the beta. So some dungeons, quests, etc might feel off.

Conveniences and Things to Do In WoW<br />
You're forcing people to grind the rep to exalted multiple times if you require exalted with the rep to use the mount. If you make the mounts all BoA and don't require the exalted rep on a toon to use said mount, I'd be fine. But until a decision regarding that is made, I'm 10000000000% against this system. On top of this, you made the new dragons mounts require the skill you get from hitting Exalted. There's ANOTHER thing you HAVE to grind to exalted on ALL your toons if you intend to use one of the best looking mounts in game that you ALREADY had to grind to get. It's just ridiculous. You keep talking about choices, but when it comes to rep, A. Not Account Wide. B. You do it this way, or you don't get to do it at all.<br />
I believe all of the faction mounts are account wide.<br />
<br />
Our basic philosophy is that you don't have to get exalted to earn the best gear. Earning revered, even with every faction, isn't that daunting for someone who wants to log in and play regularly. Exalted is about prestige and vanity rewards, of which are best are often mounts. We want those mounts to take some amount of effort but they also aren't something you &quot;need&quot; in the game in order to do other content. I don't think it will be a brutal grind, and ideally you'll have fun along the way, but at the end of the day we want the game to be about playing to earn rewards, not just earning rewards, if that makes sense.<br />
<br />
This is further reinforced by removing 310% flight from What a Long Strange Trip it's Been. If I spend an entire year getting the achievements on multiple toons (because I don't want cooking or fishing on one toon for instance), then I should get it on all toons. You guys told us LESS THAN A YEAR AGO that 310% was indeed a perk for WALSTIB. So a lot of people have been working towards it since then BECAUSE you told us.<br />
We had to change that design though in order to allow account-wide mounts, which we suspected would be an even more popular feature. With account-wide mounts, every alt you ever made would have 310% flying for free had we not made that change. We want playing an alt to be about playing an alt, and not having that alt immediately as powerful as your main (though there certainly are a lot of shortcuts).<br />
<br />
When players start getting forced to play every single day just to keep pace, you no longer have a game, you have a job.<br />
I agree with that overall, but the definition of &quot;forced&quot; is pretty slippery. Some players might feel forced to play because they really, really want a nice mount.<br />
<br />
I fundamentally believe, though there is a fair bit of data to back it up, that players lose interest when they can no longer progress their character. There are two main ways you can fail to progress. One is that you finish everything and there is nothing else to do. The other is that the tasks you want to do feel so insurmountable that you lose the urge to try. The former can be a problem if content is too gated and players are held back too often. The latter can happen when encounters feel impossible or the grind seems never ending. The challenge is to strike the right balance where players who can't play a lot feel like they aren't falling far behind, but players who want to play a lot feel like they have something to do. We can't cater to either extreme and just dismiss the other.<br />
<br />
Those players who are complaining about nothing to do have plenty to do. Their problem is they aren't doing it. They are generally focused on one type of content (usually raiding) to the exclusion of all other. When they run out of new raid content, when they've received all the loot they want, they sit there and complain about nothing do it.<br />
<br />
They could be going back to do the existing faction dailies but they don't. They could be farming old content for fun and maybe items to sell on the AH for transmog but they don't. They could be questing to experience the lore and storylines that have changed since the release of WoW, and especially in the Old World zones for Cata, but they don't. They could be engaging in Archaeology or fishing but they don't. They could be doing Arena or rated BGs with friends, but they don't.<br />
<br />
Their complaints are all based on not having enough of one specific type of content when WoW is home to multiple types.<br />
There is always more to do in the game if you look for it. Theoretically, I could tell a player that they could organize a huge roleplaying event on their server, or try to kill every boss in the game in one day, or try to /hug every NPC in Kalimdor, but that may not be anything they are interested in. Players are actually fantastic at creating their own fun -- just look at stuff like the Ironman challenge. But again, that's not going to appeal to everyone.<br />
<br />
One of the challenges we have with maxing out professions or completing achievements or leveling alts or playing BGs is that players have done it all before. Sure, with a new expansion they'll have an opportunity to do some of that content again, and if we're lucky some of it will feel fresh, but overall we think we need to offer new plays to play as well. Then, we also have to structure the reward system in such a way that goal-oriented players are interested in pursuing that content in order to earn those rewards. That is ultimately how the endgame of MoP came to be designed.<br />
<br />
We understand the concern from players with many alts that while Valor of the Ancients provides a form of Valor catch up for alts, that we could stand to have a Faction catch up for alts. That's a reasonable request and something we will investigate. <br />
<br />
To state our philosophy very simply, leveling four characters should require a lot more work than leveling one character, but there is no reason it needs to take four times as long. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/231986-30hrs-for-1-piece-of-valor-accurate/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6247836724?page=24#476))<br />
<br />
Content Difficulty and Consumption Speed<br />
extra mechanics. take rogues and druids, stealth through the dungeon. take a shaman healer, use Symbosis or whatever on him / her, they get stealth. run through the dungeon and kill crap. That's basically your extra mechanics.<br />
Except for the fact that there're requirements through the challenge dungeons that force you, among other things, to kill a set number of creatures on the dungeon to complete the objective, so ignoring pulls won't net you anything.<br />
<br />
Also, you want challenging content, and your answer to that challenging content is that, rather than doing it you'd just stealth through it...<br />
<br />
Why should &quot;bud&quot; have similar rewards than those that dedicate alot more time into mastering the game? Its like paying for a vacation while the next gets maybe a day less of the same vacation but has to pay alot less. I would feel like getting kicked in the balls.<br />
Except he doesn't. Hardcore raiders have heroic titles, heroic only bosses/bosses with heroic only phases, heroic mounts, achievements for those heroic kills. &quot;Bud&quot; wouldn't get that on the LFR.<br />
<br />
Curiosity: Initially this mode appealed to me. And then it dawned. Let's say I make my A-team for this, run through it, get gold. What reason is there to go back? In other words, what is the replay value of this extra mode (rehashed nonetheless)?<br />
If noone on your realm ever beats your time, none. If you don't care about getting to the top of the table for that dungeon in your realm, none.<br />
<br />
In the other hand, if you want to show that your team is simply the best, you'll probably keep going back many times, as with gear normalization there's just no other way to do it faster than through improving efficiency.<br />
<br />
How hypocritical of you, as always. Challenge mode's purpose is to finish the dungeon as fast as possible. That means that any way to do it is to be taken into account in order to do it asap.<br />
If you go out of your way (not you, specifically) to ask for challenging content and speak about how much you love challenging, difficult content, but then proceed to say that you'd just skip the pulls in those dungeons, then something doesn't add up. Because in fact, what you'd be doing by skipping pulls, is making your way through difficult content by just not fighting it, which doesn't sound (at least to me) like actually wanting to face challenging content.<br />
<br />
Honestly for challenge modes I was just expecting and wanting really tough bosses/pulls. Not arcade style speed runs.<br />
I'll reiterate it again: Challenge mode is tuned higher than Heroic, there's additional pulls and mechanics, and there's a criteria you need to fulfill (similar to Scenarios) in order to complete the challenge. In that criteria there's a number of creatures to be defeated inside that dungeon.

<br />
Legendary Items<br />
I feel like there is a lack of legendary items. Obviously this is because they are meant to be super rare and I understand this...Keep them very hard to get and taking the majority of the expansion to farm for.<br />
Would the legendaries just end up as 'the' weapons to have for each class though? To the point where people wouldn't be considered for guilds/raids unless they have it, assuming the updated stats were as good as they were originally.

Suggestion: White-Worgen<br />
It’s a cool idea and we might consider it for the future, although right now, we don’t really have any plans to implement additional worgen color options.

Retribution Changes<br />
The easiest way to handle this is to tell us:<br />
<br />
What was your damage before?<br />
What is your damage now?<br />
What do you think your damage should be?<br />
Is someone beating you that you think should not be?<br />
<br />
Numbers are going to go up and numbers are going to go down until launch, and possibly after. It's going to be an exhausting few weeks if every number change we do launches threads that I'd characterize as &quot;Don't nerf me bro.&quot; <br />
<br />
also about all those damage reductions do you guys do that incrementally while testing or reduce damage now and test later??? Seems to me it's more of a nerf everything now and do testing exclusively later then if it doesn't work bring it back! Correct me if I'm wrong on this! <br />
No, we do a lot of testing and agree on which specs need to come up or down and then figure out the best strategy to adjust that damage. We are doing more across-the-board buffs or nerfs these days (or hitting passives) since we aren't in most cases trying to change priorities or rotations, just hitting overall DPS.<br />
<br />
A really typical situation for us to be in at this stage in development is that DPS gradually crept up because inflated damage numbers were covering up for a lot of bugs. Now that those bugs are all getting fixed, and now that things like underpowered talents, glyphs, set bonuses and the like have been adjusted, then DPS has inched up for almost everyone. At this point we have nerfed almost every class except rogues and Feral druids, who just happened to be pretty close to our target numbers already. (I'm guessing Arms will be okay or need buffs, but we're not there yet.)<br />
<br />
No, not really. That's why you need numbers. Which you still didn't give. What does middle-of-the-pack dps mean in the context of beta? What if the top half are all the untuned specs?<br />
Yeah. And if middle of the pack is offensive, then who exactly should be middle of the pack? Healers? Then who is at the bottom? <br />
<br />
The danger of displaying DPS in a stack rank (which is what World of Logs and most sites do, as wonderful as they are overall) is that it's a stack rank. If you're middle of the pack but the guy on top is 200 DPS ahead of you, that's not really a difference, though it can be arresting when displayed visually.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to sound patronizing, but a strategy we use is to divide things into buckets. Look at the bars that are close together and put those into buckets. If the Shadow priest, Ret paladin and Enhance shaman bars are all close together, then put them into a bucket and call that &quot;high dps&quot; even if the Ret is above the shaman. If the next series of bars looks noticeably smaller, cluster those together and call them &quot;medium dps.&quot; There might be one bucket or there might be 5-6, but even in a 25-player raid you don't often see 25 buckets.<br />
<br />
That's YOUR job and YOUR job only to ensure all classes are on an even plane. It's our job to report our findings with the class we play. This isn't a &quot;Don't nerf me bro.&quot; thread idiot.<br />
Are we calling each other names now? That could be fun. Tragically, I have moderators on my side, so I'll probably win.<br />
<br />
We're totally comfortable doing our jobs. We have targets for DPS and we strive to hit them. We also appreciate feedback from the community and we give you an opportunity to point out potential problems. However, if you want to convince us that we need to change our numbers, the burden of proof is on you. We're not going to seek permission from the community to balance the game the way it needs to be balanced. <br />
<br />
You said &quot;Damage before was higher than damage now.&quot; Yes, we know. We nerfed the damage. Is it too low now? Why? By how much? What's your argument? If anyone could just post on the forums &quot;My damage is too low now,&quot; and we had to buff based on that, we'd be in an interesting (but perhaps very entertaining) situation.<br />
<br />
HoW being usable throughout AW is a key Paladin attribute.<br />
We think using Hammer of Wrath during Avenging Wrath was a fun change for paladins that made wings more than just a percent increase to all damage. I'm not sure we would immediately buff Hammer of Wrath if we left it only as an execute. I understand that Execute and Shadow Word: Death are fun, but we don't really want Hammer of Wrath to be a mirror of those abilities. We have enough mirrored abilities already.<br />
<br />
I can appreciate that it's a change you would make if you were in my shoes. I fully acknowledge that this is a very subjective business.

Double Time Changes<br />
Double Time works like Roll or DK runes. We are still struggling a little bit with how to describe the &quot;charge&quot; mechanic, which works fairly intuitively once you play with it. We're really trying to avoid &quot;Your Charge has two charges.&quot; <br />
<br />

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session or cancel it entirely, due to bugs, builds, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Given the breadth of this testing session, it's perhaps more likely than usual that one of these sessions will need to be rescheduled or switched to a different boss. We'll keep this thread updated with any such modifications.<br />

Plus you could get from 85 - 90 in two days questing an that was without the xp guild perks. Im a very slow leveler compared to some of my friends. (Especially questing cause i hate it sooooo much)<br />

Exactly. When leveling on beta, I ended up doing like 5 quests in Kun-Lai Summit before moving on. It wasn't like I did all of the quests in Jade Forest and Valley of the Four Winds either, I skipped a ton of those quests.</div></div><hr />

So, in your ideal circumstance you would pay for a game and then pay to not complete a large portion of the content?<br />
<br />
I don't get it :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
The majority of the developers work tends to be aimed at the level cap. Forcing people to get there faster is counter-intuitive to wanting them to experience dungeons, PvP or raid content quickly. Changes like this also don't help people see more of the new questing content because if people want to see that there's nothing stopping them from seeing it at level 90. Those who don't will simply skip through it automatically regardless of how much increase the EXP needed to level.<br />
<br />
In saying this, I only truly find it slightly inconvenient and only because I have more than one character that I'd want at level 90, if/when I get the game.<br />
<br />
What would be nice is if levelling times were decreased after you had achieved the max level on one character.</div></div><hr />

I see leveling as an obstacle to my fun AKA raiding. Idgaf about quests and never have and never will.

He would pay to get through the content he doesn't want to do to get to the content he wants to do. I'm tight with money and I would probably pay 10€ to get a lvl 90 instantly.<br />

I hate it to spend days leveling a character just to get to gear it for a day or two. Meaning I need to &quot;torture&quot; myself for days to be able to enjoy the game I bought for less time. Adding a magical leveling service would be a good idea, in my opinion.<br />

Blizzard wants players to explore the entire content of the expansion they sold to their customers. Besides if you are only interested in end game content, it would be well worth your while to quest through certain zones to open up certain daily quests that will in turn grant you access to the only available valor gear, thus forcing you to quest into these two end zones pretty much opens the gates towards the end goal!<br />

No one wants to take 24 hours to level. It's boring. Most people only care about endgame PVE or PVP because that's the strength of this game. If you like leveling you should go play Runescape. You'll be able to sit and level in that game for YEARS. It sounds like your kind of game. You seem to be confusing leveling with a challenge when it's more boring than LFR DS. Of course I don't want them to just hand out gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't give me that bullshit. Having leveled characters to max level in the 10's it's a chore in the way that it is not difficult or interesting in any way, shape or form.<br />
<br />
If I wouldn't like the end game but I would like leveling there wouldn't be an issue. I'd level up to 85 or 90 or whatever and shelve the character and create a new one. Leveling is basically an attunement, just a way more hideous and boring one.<br />
<br />
About buying every piece of gear for basically nothing, why would I want to? The progression in the game works quite simply: you acquire gear to complete content, not to 'get gear'. Who cares what gear you've got as long as you're able to do well in the gear you're wearing. I don't understand your point of buying all the best gear from vendors instantly.<br />
<br />
A really, really bad example. Very comparable to leveling if you look at the surface and don't think about it, but the thing is, you acquire gear while doing the content you enjoy. You don't do the content to get gear, you do it because you enjoy it. <br />
<br />
Gear is a tool. Leveling is a chore. See? Quite a different thing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Somebody</div><div class="date">2012-08-11, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't see the logic in wanting to do dungeons all day over having a balanced mix of questing/LFD to level. When you're questing (and personally I will only do quests until 90 and even at cap) the content is fresh and free of artificial sweeteners. Dungeons lack the ability to stay fresh especially when you're doing them with the same friends, presumably the same character makeup. Once you run through the 6 dungeons that are available to you while leveling, you will be experiencing the same thing over and over again, sure you'd be getting good at it, but it would certainly burn me out very quickly. Not only will the story line (if you even care about it) not make sense if all you do is run dungeons, but you will be caught in the cataclysm-syndrome of last expansion where all you do is sit on your ass in Orgrimmar waiting for que to pop.<br />
<br />
If you played any of these expansions when they launched, they all seemed to have a long way to get to level cap, and that's is one of the biggest playing points of WoW. When blizz announces an &quot;increases of experience required for 85-90&quot; they are really just fixing it to be the same flow its been in past expansions. You really weren't supposed to get that used to the XP nerfs in cataclysm when it only took 3 zones to get to 85. We will likely see the past required XP again once they nerf it which will be much later in the expansion (as it always has been).<br />
<br />
I don't know why and I don't usually get this ticked off at people QQing about stupid shit, but this really hit a soft spot for me :P<br />

It's not because so many quests were missed because people could skip second half of zones. Nope.<br />
<br />
You hate leveling? Too bad. Just do the world a favor and don't pretend like you know shit about what &quot;most&quot; people like or do not like with this game.<br />
If no one enjoyed leveling, Blizzard wouldn't even bother. Funny how it's the hardcore crowd, who continously make witty remarks about blizzard soon &quot;giving you a button to hit max level and mail you gear&quot; then cry like babies because the new levels will take a bit longer to do.<br />
If these XP levels were in the minute beta went live, would you bitch and moan as much? No. You just took the first number, set that as final, then complain about numbers in beta getting changed.<br />

Leveling and questing is the best thing about playing mmo's, if you don't like it, go play Call of Duty, there you can spend all the time you want doing the &quot;end game&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Somebody</div><div class="date">2012-08-11, 10:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About buying every piece of gear for basically nothing, why would I want to? The progression in the game works quite simply: you acquire gear to complete content, not to 'get gear'. Who cares what gear you've got as long as you're able to do well in the gear you're wearing. I don't understand your point of buying all the best gear from vendors instantly.<br />
<br />
A really, really bad example. Very comparable to leveling if you look at the surface and don't think about it, but the thing is, you acquire gear while doing the content you enjoy. You don't do the content to get gear, you do it because you enjoy it. <br />
<br />
Gear is a tool. Leveling is a chore. See? Quite a different thing.<br />
<br />
When did you start playing this game?!<br />
<br />
Leveling is also progression as is getting gear. You are improving your characters level first before you can acquire the best gear. This is a fundamental element of an RPG, if you don't like it, you need to find another game genre.<br />
<br />
Also, the fact that getting gear is your ultimate goal is just awful and shallow and leaves plenty of room for you to view this GAME as a job when all you want to do is run dungeons or raid. Once you get full heroic raid gear, then what? The end?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">therayeffect</div><div class="date">2012-08-11, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't see the logic in wanting to do dungeons all day over having a balanced mix of questing/LFD to level. When you're questing (and personally I will only do quests until 90 and even at cap) the content is fresh and free of artificial sweeteners. Dungeons lack the ability to stay fresh especially when you're doing them with the same friends, presumably the same character makeup. Once you run through the 6 dungeons that are available to you while leveling, you will be experiencing the same thing over and over again, sure you'd be getting good at it, but it would certainly burn me out very quickly. Not only will the story line (if you even care about it) not make sense if all you do is run dungeons, but you will be caught in the cataclysm-syndrome of last expansion where all you do is sit on your ass in Orgrimmar waiting for que to pop.<br />
<br />
If you played any of these expansions when they launched, they all seemed to have a long way to get to level cap, and that's is one of the biggest playing points of WoW. When blizz announces an &quot;increases of experience required for 85-90&quot; they are really just fixing it to be the same flow its been in past expansions. You really weren't supposed to get that used to the XP nerfs in cataclysm when it only took 3 zones to get to 85. We will likely see the past required XP again once they nerf it which will be much later in the expansion (as it always has been).<br />
<br />
I don't know why and I don't usually get this ticked off at people QQing about stupid shit, but this really hit a soft spot for me :P<br />
/endrant<br />
<br />
Ok, &quot;fresh and free of artificial sweeteners.&quot; Have you just started playing or something? Questing is basically Kill X and Gather Y. It's the same shit over and over. I also don't want to run dungeons 40 times, I just want to be max level so I can start raiding. The only challenge in this game to me is the Race to Server First and clearing heroic raids while undergeared. You seem to be confused that people didn't level outside dungeons in Cata (80 to 85). I sure leveled in zones, in fact I've done it 6 Goddamn times now. Cata zones are by far and away the worst zones I've had the displeasure of leveling through. The worst overall leveling was definitely Northrend though prenerfs. This is the kind of leveling we're going to go into with this XP increase. Northrend. It took me like 3 weeks to fucking hit 80. That shit isn't fun man. It's a chore and nothing more. You're the epitome of what a casual is and I don't have a problem with that, but I really don't like leveling. I simply want to get to the raiding and actually having to use more than .01% of my brain power to play this game.<br />
<br />
I really wish they'd just offer a way to pay to be 90. They make so much money off of us hardcores as is, I'm kind of surprised they don't have that implemented already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started playing the game in mid-TBC. I don't care about the role-playing parts of the game all that much, they're a nice thing to see every now and then and I'm not willing to have that part of the game taken away since that content is very skippable, as in you don't need to read the quest texts and whatnot.<br />
<br />
I'm not willing to have a part of the game removed, I'm willing to have it be able to be skipped for an amount of money. Does it take anything away from you? No.<br />
<br />
Also, I think you misunderstood me. My ultimate goal isn't getting gear, that's the exact opposite of what I was saying. My ultimate goal is beating the content, no matter with what gear I've got. And that's the end, until Blizzard releases new content, of course. During the period of time when I've beaten the content but new isn't available my ultimate goal is to gather as much gear to be able to have as big of an edge to beating the new content.<br />
<br />
As I said, gear is a tool to beating content, not a goal.</div></div><hr />

Leveling isn't progression anymore. It might be in other games but in order to balance max level, Blizz NERFS your character as you level when you level from old max to new in expansions. If I constantly progressed like we used to during back in the day MMOs, it wouldn't be near as bad leveling. I'm going to go from 55k dps on live to probably 20k on live by 87. The only real progression for me anymore is raiding and getting gear is simple a tool to get raids clear.</div></div><hr />

NO raider wants to sit and level while they could be doing heroics and getting ready for Mogu'shan Vaults. I don't know what all you people are talking about saying that leveling on the beta was too fast. Are you kidding me? It was long and boring as hell, and now they're making it last longer. I bet 75% of the gamebase doesn't even read quest text anymore, I certainly don't. Basically it's just a &quot;Kill this&quot;, &quot;Gather This&quot; grind to 90 that *Most Raiders* don't like at all. Compared to Cata where the Exp. required boosted like crazy from level to level, MoP didn't really. I admit I only did about 65 quests in each zone. It could use maybe a 15% increase but 55% is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

you're not hardcore. your whining about something that the majority of people either like or are indifferent to. and want a button to skip 80% of the content in the game so that you can raid for 1 night a week. asking for shortcuts and easy buttons is something a casual does. you wouldnt have made it in vanilla back then it was faster to grind mobs in arathi then to do quests. if it took you 3 weeks to reach 80 then you're not hardcore. in fact no one who is hardcore goes around bragging about how their hardcore they just do their job and get it done then unsub till next patch</div></div><hr />

I really don't know what to say to you, I'm not trying to persuade you to enjoy the questing experience, but if you don't enjoy it and only play the game for the competitive edge of having done things first, you might want to try to find another game or hobby all together, and I can't recommend any since I nor anyone I know is so competitive they must be anal about everything that opposes their success. If you want to set a record that will show up when any random person searches on the leaderboards, you can always bite your lip while you level then bust your ass in challenge mode all day long - or you can try other games like FPS such as Call of Duty, or any generic racing game that can be played online (off topic: Mario Kart Wii is still a competitive game that is still setting world records in time trials and continues to have tournaments).<br />

There's no challenge in leveling. If leveling was actually engaging and shit I wouldn't mind it. Personally I was pretty indifferent to leveling, because it was only like 15 hours or so. I don't consider leveling content either. It's all gather X and kill Y. It took me 3 weeks to reach 80 back in the day because I actually had a job then and worked 80 hours a fucking week. EXCUSE ME for not being able to no life the game because I had to work so much. Thankfully I'm working a whole lot less now so I can actually be a hardcore raider. I'm also not going to be raiding 1 night a week. Here's our current plan:<br />
-Max level main (max level profs, know how to play all specs)<br />
-Max level alt ( know how to play main spec, BE RAID READY first week)<br />
-Raid Schedule:<br />
*Monday - Thursday * 7pm ST - 12pm ST (Sundays 7pm ST - 12pm ST if Necessary)<br />
BRING TO RAID:<br />
~200 potions<br />
-Flasks<br />
-Food<br />
-Enough gold for repairs<br />
Expect approximately 50+ wipes a week.<br />
Theorycrafting is assumed.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that you guys are so blinded by nostalgia that you can't see through your rose tinted goggles anymore. Very few high end raiders like leveling. All this change does is add 24 more hours of leveling to my schedule. It's extending 'content' that I find to simply be a chore and work. In fact the majority of people who like leveling are actually the super casuals (who are the majority of the game). This is why I asked for an &quot;I'm 90 button&quot; because a lot of people who don't raid like questing and there's no reason to take their fun from them, though Blizzard sure loves taking hardcore raiders' fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But still, when I'm leveling and see people at max level after a few hours, it just makes me angry. Can't explain why, it just does. Somehow makes me feel like the expansion is over, see you in two years. The vast majority DOES like leveling in new areas and experiences new quests. They game can not be catered to those few hardcore raiders who don't (even many of then do).</div></div><hr />

Hilarious. You basically flip-flopped on your arguments but whatever. See what's so annoying to me is that you casuals just don't get it. There ISN'T anything else. And there WON'T be anything else. Blizzard has the market for &quot;HARDCORES&quot; cornered and that's why they aren't doing anything for us. This is why we stick around and complain to Blizzard. I destroyed Inferno mode in Diablo 3 prenerf and I dragged my feet. I'll never understand the &quot;true casual&quot; and how they like to just sort of derp around. It doesn't make sense to me. I have fun competing because it's what challenges my mind. You know what's even crazier? I'm not really even that good. I don't want to take your fun, that's what Blizzard did to us Hardcores and I'd much rather not have that happen to you guys. That's why I suggested the lvl 90 button. It would make leveling OPTIONAL so I don't have to do it and yet would let those who like to do it, still be able to do it.</div></div><hr />

They've removed all rep tabards and you don't get rep in dungeons. It's a super grind now and not just &quot;oh level my alt as a tank or healer with X tabard on&quot;.

The reason I was shocked by this is because the amount of time to level was already about the same as it was in Cata. They're gonna make us level the same amount of time as friggen Wotlk now. That shit was unbearable.<br />

By all means, tell yourself that all you care about is raiding, but if that's true, then no doubt you'll be gearing, and farming cash, and getting rep. All of that can be done while levelling too. I don't see the big deal.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I agree, it's already impossible to finish a zone without doing grey quests in that level range, it makes no sense to nerf that...</div></div><hr />

For the thousandth time, grinding isn't hard. That's why I hate it. It's mind-numbingly boring. You blind nostalgia peeps need to take off your glasses and actually read what I type. I loved tier 11 and the heroics. I play a Rogue. I actually got to play my goddamn class and push buttons that I forgot how to use again. Shit was glorious. The problem with the valor isn't that I have to do shit, it's that I have to do mostly boring easy ass shit like dailies. Over and over and OVER again. I like that leveling is currently a joke, because I can't fucking stand it. <br />

A lot of people seem to forget on the Beta you were RESTED formaybe 2 levels or more, which made the XP gain from monsters double. Since you had a lot of kill quests or kill mobs to get to quests; you gain a lot of XP. Take away that Rested part and leveling will take 30% more. + the 55% increase on XP needed to get a level up. We're looking at a &quot;16h if you know the quests from the beta&quot;, to a &quot;25h if you know the quests from the beta&quot;. Not even talking about those who didn't level up on the beta and don't know where to go or don't know how to use quest objects. For CASUAL players (which is 85% of the playerbase or even more) it will take a WEEK to level up, then TRY to grab some gear for the world events and HOPE you can get enough gear to start doing other things, (since casuals do LFFacerollRaid). <br />
We all know there are 2 kinds of people in this game; 1 raiders (being it hardcore or just casual) who dislike leveling since the endgame = raiding for them (same for those who do PVP). and 1; socials/casuals: who just level alts and keep leveling since they enjoy that part of the game.<br />
Although maybe 85% of the playerbase is the 2nd of my examples, this game was made for ENDGAME experience, quests were made for the Lore and make you level up. Why would you slow down the Endgame part by making leveling last 55% longer...<br />
Those who enjoy questing etc; even if you reach maximum level you can do the quests, but for those who dislike leveling, why FORCE them to do ALL the quests in a zone, instead of those which are needed for the reputations or rewards ? You want to do quests; do them, you don't; don't be forced to..</div></div><hr />

Its near impossible with doing any dungeons. JF is ok, you ding when you do all the quests, but 86-90 is another story.<br />
<br />
Have done all Krasarang Wilds quest, got the achievement hit 86.5, done 70% of VotFW and dinged, guess what new level, new zone. Kun'lai Summit, i should be able to ding to 88 from 87 there. Done all quests including Valley of Eternal Blossoms prequest, guess what I am 70% on the xp bar to go for Townlong and Dreadwastes. <br />
<br />
Reading from other players who tried to level from 89 to 90, they say doing whole dreadwastes area plus the dailies, they are 20% short to ding to 90. <br />
<br />
Surely this was not intended, if we are going to do all the quests in Pandaria and not hit 90, there is smth wrong there. The XP buff to level was needed but not with that margin, now it needs a nerf to the required XP per level or a buff to the current quest XPs..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Precisely. Non-account wide mounts are (simply speaking) class-exclusive, raiding and PVP mounts, which are outside of scope of this discussion :p All rep-earned mounts are to our knowledge account-wide, so there is no need to grind to exalted several times. The only possible exception would be Cloud Serpents (you need to get exalted to train cloud serpent flying), but I don't know how it is handled since I never got that far on Beta.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's not hard, but still enjoyable for many.

I struggled to level in Townlong Steppes... I don't get how you guys think all this stuff was so quick. Part of it might of been that the cage quest to rescue some wardens or w/e was bugged. Still though. I took 22 or 23 hours to level on Beta. That's FOREVER. I've spent less time clearing raids in the last month than that for crying out loud.<br />

I agree with that overall, but the definition of &quot;forced&quot; is pretty slippery. Some players might feel forced to play because they really, really want a nice mount.<br />
<br />
I fundamentally believe, though there is a fair bit of data to back it up, that players lose interest when they can no longer progress their character. There are two main ways you can fail to progress. One is that you finish everything and there is nothing else to do. The other is that the tasks you want to do feel so insurmountable that you lose the urge to try. The former can be a problem if content is too gated and players are held back too often. The latter can happen when encounters feel impossible or the grind seems never ending. The challenge is to strike the right balance where players who can't play a lot feel like they aren't falling far behind, but players who want to play a lot feel like they have something to do. We can't cater to either extreme and just dismiss the other.<br />
<br />

<br />
Why not just not use those bonuses though? I personally hate leveling. I don't mind questing from time to time, but I hate having to quest. I hate not being able to play the part of the game I do enjoy. Anything that makes it faster has been better for me. At least you can choose not to access some of the benefits. I can't imagine you RAF so often you have one always following you around. That would be kind of impressive in its own way, but I don't see it being likely.<br />

No one wants to take 24 hours to level. It's boring. Most people only care about endgame PVE or PVP because that's the strength of this game. If you like leveling you should go play Runescape. You'll be able to sit and level in that game for YEARS. It sounds like your kind of game. You seem to be confusing leveling with a challenge when it's more boring than LFR DS. Of course I don't want them to just hand out gear.<br />
<br />
I don't mind taking my time to level, and many others (not every single person in the world of Warcraft) feel the same way. Kindly ditch the ego and do not assume you speak for everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You only level your main character once. And for some of us, we like it to actually feel like a journey and not something we knocked out in 12 hours.<br />
<br />
What about altoholics? With 9 other 85s? + soon to be monk from 1-90 too. We have to feel the pain? I really hope that 300% xp elixir is gonna make it to live, be easily accessible and work 1-90. Becuase I sure aint gonna level 10 chars to 90 if each char is gonna take an average of 4 days straight leveling. I like to slack and be social while leveling. So each level takes about a day for me with alts. Even 84-85 took me usually 2-3 days because it took forever to level. So I hope that 300% xp, and atleast 2 new BoA items are on live when MoP gets released so I can be faster to level with all my alts when my main is 90. I don't wanna miss out on gearing my main, doing raids, challange dungeons, and all that stuff, and I don't wanna be level 90 on my alts 2-3 months after launch.</div></div><hr />

The issue (minor, but still) that I have with current XP increase is the following: In Cata, leveling was linear, and you were required to complete all the hubs to advance to the next zone. In MOP Beta pre-XP buff, you can do the hubs in pretty much whatever order you want to and skip some of them. With the buff, you are pretty much condemned to do all of them, which sort of bounces us back to &quot;linear&quot; (it's not really linear, but it nets the same) questing.</div></div><hr />

It makes you feel better the game and people will have another one and a half year to raid. Isn't that enough?<br />

yea man exactly... i leveled to 87.5 but took a break and now i come back and there aren't enough quests in the zone to get ya on track as you progress through that zone level wise.. someone needs to fix that</div></div><hr />

Meh, I'll still be leveling all 10 85s to 90 eventually, though it will just take longer now. Personally, I would rather level faster and hit 90 without having done some of the later zones or without doing much of them, because questing is somewhat of a nice gold boost for me since I enjoy it. But anyways, this really changes nothing, I'll still be buying the great expansion, and leveling to 90, and then raiding!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really is it that hard to level, though depends what class you are playing. Mixing questing with the odd dungeon does help, I know I have leveled 3 toons to 90 in under 2 weeks, forth is at 88 and I have 2 at 86.<br />
<br />
But what made it easier for me is that the second and third time around I knew what quests were where and what I had to do and that made it faster, but leveling with 200% rested and the guild perks makes go fast once you know what ya doing.. (And if you are lucky to kill a rare with the BOA 300% XP trinket / potion that goes very fast indeed..<br />
<br />
And yes the amount of gold from quests you do does add up close to but not quite 9000 gold.<br />

Maybe they did it to get folks to do all the quests to make sure they are not bugged.. And if you have cleared all the zones to Kun Lai Summit there is still Dread Wastes and Townlong Steppes..</div></div><hr />

<br />
32.8 million XP to level from 89 to 90? At this point the numbers are just meaningless. It would make more sense if they could figure out a way to do away with numbers altogether. They should just have the total XP for each level be 100%. Then depending on what level you are, and what quest you are doing, you get a percentage for killing mobs or completing quests. I'd rather see that then 32,800,000 XP to hit 90.</div></div><hr />

That's not very nice my friend. I hate questing and leveling. If you guys who like it want to do it, that's fine. Do it when you're 90 or on alts. I don't want to do it, I want to be 90 as fast as possible so I can get to doing what I do like and that's raiding.<br />
<br />
Even with this change, its gonna be much longer than Cata leveling. Currently you can breeze through MoP in 10-11 hours, the 4-5 hours more aint gonna kill you,,,<br />

What about altoholics? With 9 other 85s? + soon to be monk from 1-90 too. We have to feel the pain? I really hope that 300% xp elixir is gonna make it to live, be easily accessible and work 1-90. Becuase I sure aint gonna level 10 chars to 90 if each char is gonna take an average of 4 days straight leveling. I like to slack and be social while leveling. So each level takes about a day for me with alts. Even 84-85 took me usually 2-3 days because it took forever to level. So I hope that 300% xp, and atleast 2 new BoA items are on live when MoP gets released so I can be faster to level with all my alts when my main is 90. I don't wanna miss out on gearing my main, doing raids, challange dungeons, and all that stuff, and I don't wanna be level 90 on my alts 2-3 months after launch.<br />
<br />
fisrt of all, its not that slow, 15 hours or so with this nerf AND your alts are gonna have atleast a level worth of XP that will carry you well into 88...</div></div><hr />

He is talking about mounts here right? Nice what this community has gone to.

Does it really matter if it takes you 20 hours to hit 90 or 26 hours to hit 90.. you are still going to have 4-5 days of running heroics before the raid opens. Also, it actually helps you to quest through zones that first week because you will have the rep to start buying epics. If you are a hardcore raider, you are also going to have your profs optimized, which will require killing mobs for spirits.<br />
<br />
Makes absolutely no sense to by crying about this when the raid doesn´t even open that first week anyway. I could somewhat see an argument if we were racing to get as many bosses down in the first lockout as possible, but as it is, we are going to be sitting at 90 for probably 4 days before we can even get into a raid. There is NOTHING in this change that is preventing us from raiding, because we already can´t raid the first week.</div></div><hr />

This is essentially the exact thought process I had when I read GC's reply to the hunter #'s posted. They've overshot us so bad I don't even know if there are any parses for anyone to post.

If no one enjoyed leveling, Blizzard wouldn't even bother. Funny how it's the hardcore crowd, who continously make witty remarks about blizzard soon &quot;giving you a button to hit max level and mail you gear&quot; then cry like babies because the new levels will take a bit longer to do.<br />
If these XP levels were in the minute beta went live, would you bitch and moan as much? No. You just took the first number, set that as final, then complain about numbers in beta getting changed.<br />

<br />
Hmm.. I used to be a hard core raider and you know what I hate now? Wiping on a boss at 10% over and over, I hate that feeling of downing something just to find out that the gear I needed didn't drop. I hate that feeling when we kill the boss and boomkin gear drops and there are not fucking boomkins.<br />
So why can't I just have a button that gives me everything I want from a certain raid?<br />
<br />
Because let's be honest here, unless you are the world first/realm first, raiding is not that hard. It's scripted fights, there are even addons that tell you when the next &quot;big cast&quot; is coming. Yogg 0 was the only thing I had seen from WoW that made me think we were going back to old raiding days. The hardest part of raiding is finding the other 9/24 people don't have mental deficiencies and decide to stand in fire, pull aggro, etc. After that it's learn fight, watch video, rinse, repeat.<br />
Let me have all my professions at max level at the push of a button for that matter, because after all leveling professions isn't that hard either.<br />
<br />
You newer &quot;hard cores&quot;, don't know the first thing about hard core. Raid Sunwell before the nerf then we will talk.<br />
<br />
You guys sound like those stupid kids that would use rare candies on their Pokemon so they could be level 100...<br />
<br />
It may be rose colored glasses or nostalgia, but you &quot;wow kids&quot; have no clue what a hard time to do things in WoW is. Mad hunters are getting nerfed yet again? Try dealing with a dead zone. Don't want to push so many buttons? Try mashing ONE FUCKING BUTTON for years as a hunter. ONE. You could literally macro your entire rotation to ONE button. Sure you may not do as much damage as a hunter managing his pet cooldowns but I watched many a hunter do it. <br />
Hell I can't even bitch about the difficulty really, the true Veterans of WoW that played sine DAY ONE of vanilla are the ones would could talk about hard. I started only two months before BC, and rerolled when BC dropped, but I know this, if you had ever suggested half the crap you guys are right now back then, you would be too embarrassed to show your &quot;face&quot; in a forum again. You would have been ripped apart.</div></div><hr />

You guys sound like those stupid kids that would use rare candies on their Pokemon so they could be level 100...<br />
<br />
It may be rose colored glasses or nostalgia, but you &quot;wow kids&quot; have no clue what a hard time to do things in WoW is. Mad hunters are getting nerfed yet again? Try dealing with a dead zone. Don't want to push so many buttons? Try mashing ONE FUCKING BUTTON for years as a hunter. ONE. You could literally macro your entire rotation to ONE button. Sure you may not do as much damage as a hunter managing his pet cooldowns but I watched many a hunter do it. <br />
Hell I can't even bitch about the difficulty really, the true Veterans of WoW that played sine DAY ONE of vanilla are the ones would could talk about hard. I started only two months before BC, and rerolled when BC dropped, but I know this, if you had ever suggested half the crap you guys are right now back then, you would be too embarrassed to show your &quot;face&quot; in a forum again. You would have been ripped apart.<br />

<br />
Hmm.. I used to be a hard core raider and you know what I hate now? Wiping on a boss at 10% over and over, I hate that feeling of downing something just to find out that the gear I needed didn't drop. I hate that feeling when we kill the boss and boomkin gear drops and there are not fucking boomkins.<br />
So why can't I just have a button that gives me everything I want from a certain raid?<br />
<br />
Because let's be honest here, unless you are the world first/realm first, raiding is not that hard. It's scripted fights, there are even addons that tell you when the next &quot;big cast&quot; is coming. Yogg 0 was the only thing I had seen from WoW that made me think we were going back to old raiding days. The hardest part of raiding is finding the other 9/24 people don't have mental deficiencies and decide to stand in fire, pull aggro, etc. After that it's learn fight, watch video, rinse, repeat.<br />
Let me have all my professions at max level at the push of a button for that matter, because after all leveling professions isn't that hard either.<br />

&quot;So why can't I just have a button that gives me everything I want from a certain raid?&quot; That point has been raised and laughed at and you know why. The point of a game to entertain people and most raiders find the &quot;carrot on the stick&quot; to be entertaining. Personally that's what I like the most about this game. Competing to be the first to get to eat that carrot. What you guys seem to constantly confuse is that grinding is not hard or enganging at all. That's why I can't stand it. YES raiding isn't really that hard either and finding non-idiots does indeed seem to be the hardest part about it but it's all we have and you know that. I'm sorry that Blizz can't be fucked to actually offer challenging content because the majority of players don't know how to not stand in the fire. I don't have any control over that. If I had my way, I would offer 3 SEPARATE difficulties and leave them alone. Basically give everyone what they want to an extent. Again I'm going to repeat myself, Vanilla WAS NOT HARD, it actually had very basic mechanics and strategies, it was just extremely grindy. BC WAS actually an extreme challenge. I've heard the stories and know that BC was indeed the best PVE will ever get and ever be.<br />
<br />
As for your talk about ONE button, I'm not complaining at all about having to push a lot of buttons? Hell I play a damn Rogue and I've QQ'd a bit about how stupidly boring combat is. My rotation is going to go from CDS + Keep SND up 222243 to CDS + Keep SND up 422223. 3 main buttons with a few side ones. Hopefully Blizz will buff Assassination because it feels a lot more interactive and mentally engaging than combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
The increase of xp required was badly needed. I got to 90 midway through Steepes... That wasn't right, and even that I did quite a lot of quests in other zones when the level cap was capped every level. I for one approve of this :)<br />
They said their design intent was for people to actually get to choose where to level and not have to do every zone, this way it doesn't burn people out on alts. Basically the horror that is Cata leveling. I just *LOVE* doing Hyjal to 82, Deepholm to 84, then TH to max, mixing in the exact same 4 dungeons over and over and over. /end sarcasm. I've done that shit 6 times now, soon to be 7 and I can definitely say that Cata leveling is by far and away the worst to me. I guess part of the problem is the new model they have where you do 1 or 2 quests, watch and RP event, then do 1 or 2 quests and have to watch more RP shit.</div></div><hr />

It amuses me that you still don't get that one of the fundemental parts of a RPG is just that, leveling, and that you complain about blizzard changing xp required to level when they have in fact just resetted it as beta testing is being finished just make you to a spoiled crybaby.

<br />
It amuses me that you still don't get that one of the fundamental aspects of an MMO is just that, to play with other people, and that you casuals complain about Blizzard changing the heroics so they're easier when they're designed for people who know how to play, it just makes you into a spoiled crybaby. Go play something else if you're not satisfied with what the genre/game is offering.<br />

Of the three toons I leveled all got to 90 part way through Townlong Steppes, heck even 2 of them I only did part of Krasarang Wilds as there was no need to finish that zone, and none of my toons touched questing in Dread Wastes that and with doing dungeons along the way, that's how fast it was to level and this change is needed.<br />

If you find it so boring then why do you play the game then? All MMORPG's work the same way do this to get that to gain some XP.<br />
<br />
I know what lets make everyone level 90, max out all their professions and reputations and give them top notch gear and all the mounts and pets and whatever else on the first day of launch, then you can spend the next year doing nothing because you have it all and then you will be bored.</div></div><hr />

Does it really matter if it takes you 20 hours to hit 90 or 26 hours to hit 90.. you are still going to have 4-5 days of running heroics before the raid opens. Also, it actually helps you to quest through zones that first week because you will have the rep to start buying epics. If you are a hardcore raider, you are also going to have your profs optimized, which will require killing mobs for spirits.<br />
<br />
Makes absolutely no sense to by crying about this when the raid doesn´t even open that first week anyway. I could somewhat see an argument if we were racing to get as many bosses down in the first lockout as possible, but as it is, we are going to be sitting at 90 for probably 4 days before we can even get into a raid. There is NOTHING in this change that is preventing us from raiding, because we already can´t raid the first week.<br />
<br />
Please reread what these hardcore raiders wrote. They are aiming at server first and to do that their guild master forces them to level their main to max, level their professions to max, get the best gear possible from normal and heroic dungeons and scenarios and do all that again with all their alts so that they can optimize their raid set up for each boss.<br />
<br />
For the normal player leveling longer is a good thing (and I like it) but for the hardcore it means they have to concentrate on one or two classes and do some gambling to get server first when raids open up. For most players it's (just using numbers people throw around) 22h instead of 15 but for hardcore raiders it's 110h instead of 75h because if they want to have the best chances possible they need to level and equip some alts (most hardcore raider have a minimum of 3-5 characters they play). People know the raid mechanics and can already assume which class combination will be good but numbers for raids aren't tweak yet so it could be that you have to change your raid set up to maximize your chances and if you leveled the wrong classes you're at a disadvantage that can cost you server first.<br />
<br />
I can understand why people can get fed up because of the change and it won't really change a thing for normal players because it stretches the content for another 2 days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, I fail to see how 55% of 20 hours is 6 hours. Second, the more time we spend leveling the less time we have to prepare up to the next week of raiding and taking in mind all the stuff that has to be done it's a hell of a lot of work. I don't really care if the increase makes it to live or not, but leveling in general, while a &quot;vital&quot; part of an MMO (even though very diminished in WoW), is very boring and not engaging due to the extremely high difficulty level that only the best in the world can live up to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Levels&quot; is one of, if not the most fundamental mechanic of the RPG genre. This is an MMORPG. If you hate leveling so badly regardless of how reasonable the game developer makes it, then this is not the genre for you.<br />
<br />
Making leveling boring and stupidly easy is the exact opposite of making it reasonable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So the &quot;hard cores&quot; are upset because leveling isn't hard and they hate doing it?<br />
<br />
Hmm.. I used to be a hard core raider and you know what I hate now? Wiping on a boss at 10% over and over, I hate that feeling of downing something just to find out that the gear I needed didn't drop. I hate that feeling when we kill the boss and boomkin gear drops and there are not fucking boomkins.<br />
So why can't I just have a button that gives me everything I want from a certain raid?<br />
<br />
Because let's be honest here, unless you are the world first/realm first, raiding is not that hard. It's scripted fights, there are even addons that tell you when the next &quot;big cast&quot; is coming. Yogg 0 was the only thing I had seen from WoW that made me think we were going back to old raiding days. The hardest part of raiding is finding the other 9/24 people don't have mental deficiencies and decide to stand in fire, pull aggro, etc. After that it's learn fight, watch video, rinse, repeat.<br />
Let me have all my professions at max level at the push of a button for that matter, because after all leveling professions isn't that hard either.<br />
<br />
You newer &quot;hard cores&quot;, don't know the first thing about hard core. Raid Sunwell before the nerf then we will talk.<br />
<br />
You guys sound like those stupid kids that would use rare candies on their Pokemon so they could be level 100...<br />
<br />
It may be rose colored glasses or nostalgia, but you &quot;wow kids&quot; have no clue what a hard time to do things in WoW is. Mad hunters are getting nerfed yet again? Try dealing with a dead zone. Don't want to push so many buttons? Try mashing ONE FUCKING BUTTON for years as a hunter. ONE. You could literally macro your entire rotation to ONE button. Sure you may not do as much damage as a hunter managing his pet cooldowns but I watched many a hunter do it. <br />
Hell I can't even bitch about the difficulty really, the true Veterans of WoW that played sine DAY ONE of vanilla are the ones would could talk about hard. I started only two months before BC, and rerolled when BC dropped, but I know this, if you had ever suggested half the crap you guys are right now back then, you would be too embarrassed to show your &quot;face&quot; in a forum again. You would have been ripped apart.<br />
<br />
I'm at the edge of even bothering to respond to this, but whatever. You see, your world of &quot;wiping on the very hard boss X of vanilla I see through the rose-tinted glasses&quot; to get loot isn't really the way anymore. I actually enjoy raiding in the way that I want to do it for nothing but the good time and the feeling of succession when the boss goes down. Loot doesn't matter one bit.<br />
<br />
Sure, raiding isn't all that hard. The only thing required for raiding is the mindset to want to mash your face on a boss just to get it down. Now, I don't know about that one-button-hunter thing and I don't know what you're referring to with that, the recent or the past, but I can assure you, no hunter mashes one button and is optimal while in a raid-setting.<br />
<br />
I don't really know how you can talk about something being hard in vanilla, from all I've seen and heard it was just a major grind, nothing more.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The increase of xp required was badly needed. I got to 90 midway through Steepes... That wasn't right, and even that I did quite a lot of quests in other zones when the level cap was capped every level. I for one approve of this :)<br />
<br />
I can't see that as a bad thing, since it'd take you quite a bit of alts to get to 90 and more time to majorly bore yourself out with the questing.<br />

There's literally three guilds tops in any given realm seriously competing for these server firsts. Now, I can't stand Cataclysm levelling myself; my preferred levelling option if I can't be bothered questing is to run BGs which is a nightmare in that joke bracket 80-84 or I can run the same four instances till my eyes bleed, but everytime I read &quot;but what about the poor hardcore raiders?&quot; I think to myself &quot;well, what about them?&quot; . Hardcore raiders are a minority of players, a hundred tops in any given realm, playing their own game of getting server first; now I aint fussed how people choose to play the game but why should concessions to gameplay be made because a few people in a realm like to have an artificial race with each other which has no bearing on the rest of the players?</div></div><hr />

You see, your world of &quot;wiping on the very hard boss X of vanilla I see through the rose-tinted glasses&quot; to get loot isn't really the way anymore. I actually enjoy raiding in the way that I want to do it for nothing but the good time and the feeling of succession when the boss goes down. Loot doesn't matter one bit.<br />
<br />
Sure, raiding isn't all that hard. The only thing required for raiding is the mindset to want to mash your face on a boss just to get it down. Now, I don't know about that one-button-hunter thing and I don't know what you're referring to with that, the recent or the past, but I can assure you, no hunter mashes one button and is optimal while in a raid-setting.<br />
<br />
I don't really know how you can talk about something being hard in vanilla, from all I've seen and heard it was just a major grind, nothing more.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're the one wanting a button to make you instantly level or maybe you weren't but that is who this was meant for.<br />
I don't really want a button for loot, that would be silly, once again apparently sarcasm does not equate well over the internet. <br />
<br />
The Hunter one button thing is a throw back to BC, once again you didn't see it so you're talking out of your ass as far as saying no hunter mashes one button and is optimal. (sure they don't do it these days.)<br />
<br />
This was the macro LAZY hunters did and still got top dps, and even still I did mention they did not get higher dps than those hunters who managed their CD, READ man READ.<br />

<br />
My point of the whole post was to question your &quot;point&quot;: the true Veterans of WoW that played sine DAY ONE of vanilla are the ones would could talk about hard. It's kind of odd that you claim pre-nerf Sunwell to be the hardest raid ever (which I'm not going to disagree with) yet you say only the day-one WoW players can talk about difficulty. Your point is really vague and non-existant. We're talking about leveling and it's difficulty and boredom, not about the difficulty of raids or raiding in general. I like raiding the way it is now, I don't care for the 'farm mats for resistance potions until you die' -model. I like things to be reasonably difficult without having to farm as my second job, as I do have one already.<br />
<br />
When it comes to the lazy-hunter-macro, it's cool and all that hunters were able to do that. I didn't play a hunter back in Sunwell. My point was the game has most likely taken a good direction there with not being able to do such stuff which is obviously quite dumb.<br />
<br />
I like a game to have as much interactivity as possible, which is the reason the roles I enjoy most are especially healing and tanking to a degree. It's everyone's personal opinion though. You see, leveling isn't interactive at all. I'm not asking to remove it, merely a way to skip it. It doesn't take anything away from you so why so mad?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, first ones can get what they like immediately regardless of how much XP it takes to get a level-up. Because you can still do quests at lvl 90, obviously.<br />
<br />
Second ones can't get what they want, until they do something they don't like (questing). But how is it good for the first group of people? How is it good for the game? I mean, Blizz could make leveling 10 times faster and those who like questing would still get what they want. Why make it slower instead? It only makes the second group of people feel bad about the game, and nothing else.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy seeing the new zones, seeing the sights and farming all the profession nodes I find along the way. But I understand that this is only *my* opinion, and some people share it and some people do not. It amuses me when I see people making sweeping statements that say *every* player wants to raid instantly and don't enjoy questing, or that *every* casual player wants to hop into LFR hit the &quot;1&quot; key a few times, go AFK for 10 mins and receive Heroic loot.<br />
<br />
Another thing I find amusing, is that probably a lot of playerbase who are saying &quot;how dare these scrub casuals infest *my* game, who put in less effort than me, and earn Heroic loot months after I did,&quot; are the probably same people now saying &quot;how dare Blizzard force me to put in as much effort to level to 90 as these scrub casuals. I want to be 90 instantly, so I can raid!&quot; I bet they're even probably the same people who are raging at Blizzard for holding back raids for a week after launch.

<br />
Don't jump to conclusions. Because I've posted on the thread about the XP change you probably consider me a part of the vocal minority but claiming things you've no idea of is ridiculous. Why would you say, without anything to back it up, that I or any other person in the forums would be 'raging at Blizzard' for holding their raids back for a week? I'm all in on that, that is a great thing and I appreciate it a lot.<br />
<br />
I have also never said that those said 'scrub casuals' are infesting my game with their LFR or other stuff. LFR or any other more casual-friendly thing doesn't affect my gaming experience in any negative way. Why would I be upset if Blizzard gives other people a way to earn gear besides from organized raiding? It doesn't take anything away from me, so why should I care?<br />
<br />
Some people just lack common sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm.. I used to be a hard core raider and you know what I hate now? Wiping on a boss at 10% over and over, I hate that feeling of downing something just to find out that the gear I needed didn't drop. I hate that feeling when we kill the boss and boomkin gear drops and there are not fucking boomkins.<br />
So why can't I just have a button that gives me everything I want from a certain raid?<br />
<br />
Because let's be honest here, unless you are the world first/realm first, raiding is not that hard. It's scripted fights, there are even addons that tell you when the next &quot;big cast&quot; is coming. Yogg 0 was the only thing I had seen from WoW that made me think we were going back to old raiding days. The hardest part of raiding is finding the other 9/24 people don't have mental deficiencies and decide to stand in fire, pull aggro, etc. After that it's learn fight, watch video, rinse, repeat.<br />
Let me have all my professions at max level at the push of a button for that matter, because after all leveling professions isn't that hard either.<br />
<br />
You newer &quot;hard cores&quot;, don't know the first thing about hard core. Raid Sunwell before the nerf then we will talk.<br />
<br />
You guys sound like those stupid kids that would use rare candies on their Pokemon so they could be level 100...<br />
<br />
It may be rose colored glasses or nostalgia, but you &quot;wow kids&quot; have no clue what a hard time to do things in WoW is. Mad hunters are getting nerfed yet again? Try dealing with a dead zone. Don't want to push so many buttons? Try mashing ONE FUCKING BUTTON for years as a hunter. ONE. You could literally macro your entire rotation to ONE button. Sure you may not do as much damage as a hunter managing his pet cooldowns but I watched many a hunter do it. <br />
Hell I can't even bitch about the difficulty really, the true Veterans of WoW that played sine DAY ONE of vanilla are the ones would could talk about hard. I started only two months before BC, and rerolled when BC dropped, but I know this, if you had ever suggested half the crap you guys are right now back then, you would be too embarrassed to show your &quot;face&quot; in a forum again. You would have been ripped apart.<br />
<br />
<br />
You kind of do have a button to give you a load of epics, it's called raid finder.<br />
<br />
But I do get what you're saying, I mean its shocking that people would actually not enjoy the brainless grind to 85 and beyond, why can't everyone like the same thing? I mean people should just be exact carbon copies of each other, because that's the fantasy world I love to live in.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc2fdc1312bd</div><div class="date">2012-08-12, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's no challenge in leveling. If leveling was actually engaging and shit I wouldn't mind it. Personally I was pretty indifferent to leveling, because it was only like 15 hours or so. I don't consider leveling content either. It's all gather X and kill Y. It took me 3 weeks to reach 80 back in the day because I actually had a job then and worked 80 hours a fucking week. EXCUSE ME for not being able to no life the game because I had to work so much. Thankfully I'm working a whole lot less now so I can actually be a hardcore raider. I'm also not going to be raiding 1 night a week. Here's our current plan:<br />
-Max level main (max level profs, know how to play all specs)<br />
-Max level alt ( know how to play main spec, BE RAID READY first week)<br />
-Raid Schedule:<br />
*Monday - Thursday * 7pm ST - 12pm ST (Sundays 7pm ST - 12pm ST if Necessary)<br />
BRING TO RAID:<br />
~200 potions<br />
-Flasks<br />
-Food<br />
-Enough gold for repairs<br />
Expect approximately 50+ wipes a week.<br />
Theorycrafting is assumed.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that you guys are so blinded by nostalgia that you can't see through your rose tinted goggles anymore. Very few high end raiders like leveling. All this change does is add 24 more hours of leveling to my schedule. It's extending 'content' that I find to simply be a chore and work. In fact the majority of people who like leveling are actually the super casuals (who are the majority of the game). This is why I asked for an &quot;I'm 90 button&quot; because a lot of people who don't raid like questing and there's no reason to take their fun from them, though Blizzard sure loves taking hardcore raiders' fun.<br />
<br />
Pretty much this, I hate leveling and I hate questing, and I know many other people who feel the same way. We're also planning to do something similar with our raid team and since I'm a high school student, the release date is bad enough, let alone making me have to skip school for more than 1 day to even be able to compete in the realm first lvl 90 race. The change in the xp required makes it so much worse. People have alts, with those alts they can go see the quests or dungeons they had skipped when they were leveling their mains quickly so they can actually start doing real content.</div></div><hr />

I know I did the same thing and it wasn't until I did went through them on a few alts that I got to see them all the way through, and would have missed out on some good ones. You shouldn't be required to do every quest in every zone of course, there still needs to be plenty of choices and an relatively open path for everyone. But having to experience more of the content before being bored at the cap isn't a terrible thing imo.</div></div><hr />

Because there must be a limit to how much the game can change based on player's &quot;feedback&quot;. What we have here is players actively questioning the very feature that makes RPGs what they are. Sorry but RPGs are exactly what they are about, they are about a journey or series of journeys from bottom to top, from zero to hero, the measure of progress is in levels, gears and gained skills/spells along the way. Are we to push off what makes RPGs what they are because we developed a playerbase that has the nerve to demand core game mechanics changes? Where will it stop? <br />
<br />
I can understand that some players have gronw extremely tired because of this but that is not because the feature is bad, but because they are oversaturated with it.

If one player grows bored of leveling in RPGs it is not a signal to remove it. It's a signal for that players to try something else.

Yeah, and when you will do all quests and still not be 90, what will you do? :p<br />
Problem is not that XP was increased (it was needed), problem is it was increased way too much, to the point you (almost) have to do all the quests in game, linearizing it Cata-style.</div></div><hr />

Run a few dungeons? do dailies? look for more quests? I don't mind. Getting to 90 is not really my priority as long as I get to go around questing. When I got Cata, it took my 4 months to get to 85. Rushing to top level is sooo boring, it takes all the fun away.</div></div><hr />

Good for you, but my objective is to get to 90 ASAP. While I don't mind questing (I need the greens for enchanting anyway), I do mind grinding mobs and jumping unprepared into dungeons.<br />

Don't want to push so many buttons? Try mashing ONE FUCKING BUTTON for years as a hunter. ONE. You could literally macro your entire rotation to ONE button. Sure you may not do as much damage as a hunter managing his pet cooldowns but I watched many a hunter do it. <br />
Hell I can't even bitch about the difficulty really, the true Veterans of WoW that played sine DAY ONE of vanilla are the ones would could talk about hard. I started only two months before BC, and rerolled when BC dropped, but I know this, if you had ever suggested half the crap you guys are right now back then, you would be too embarrassed to show your &quot;face&quot; in a forum again. You would have been ripped apart.<br />
<br />
Totally agree with you!!! Very well written post, kinda says it all. <br />
<br />
There isn´t anything &quot;hardcore&quot; about WoW today, not a singel thing!!!</div></div><hr />

Especially, since starting from Townlong steppes, I'll have to respec every time I turn a quest in because of the dynamic rewards &gt;_&lt;<br />

Skipping leveling in RPGs to get to the good stuff is like skipping building up a good relationships with women in order to have sex with her. Do you understand me now?</div></div><hr />

Nope. It is especially treacherous for dungeon heroic quests: they offer blues depending on specs, unlike regular quest blues where you get all three spec items to choose from (pally PoV here, no idea about other classes).</div></div><hr />

Be aware that if the good stuff would be avaiable straight away than people would consume it quicker then Blizzard can produce it. Just like food takes longer to make it than eat it, just as much games are longer to make them than playing through them. WoW is also subscription based so they have to keep you playing for as long as possible.</div></div><hr />

Questing is basically Kill X and Gather Y. It's the same shit over and over. I also don't want to run dungeons 40 times, I just want to be max level so I can start raiding. The only challenge in this game to me is the Race to Server First and clearing heroic raids while undergeared. You seem to be confused that people didn't level outside dungeons in Cata (80 to 85). I sure leveled in zones, in fact I've done it 6 Goddamn times now. Cata zones are by far and away the worst zones I've had the displeasure of leveling through. The worst overall leveling was definitely Northrend though prenerfs. This is the kind of leveling we're going to go into with this XP increase. Northrend. It took me like 3 weeks to fucking hit 80. That shit isn't fun man. It's a chore and nothing more. You're the epitome of what a casual is and I don't have a problem with that, but I really don't like leveling. I simply want to get to the raiding and actually having to use more than .01% of my brain power to play this game.<br />
<br />
I really wish they'd just offer a way to pay to be 90. They make so much money off of us hardcores as is, I'm kind of surprised they don't have that implemented already.<br />
<br />
That is actually a great idea and Blizzard would make great cash doing that at even $10 a pop.</div></div><hr />

You will consume content faster and you are encouraged to spend less time in the zones that took an extreme amount of effort to create.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will create a situation where consumption of content is way to fast thus making creating it totally unworth it. If you see tons of people crying out loud that they are bored with current content despite how easy accesible it is, can you even begin to imagine how faster it would be if we made it even more accesible?<br />
<br />
It's bad for the game because it makes it shallow, the more shallow it gets the less interesting it gets. Yes there are people who are fed up with repetetive content but only because they do it so many times over!<br />
<br />
It's bad for players because they are not presented with any challenge but reward shower. What's the point of creating non-tangible content where players care for shinies and shinies only. It has grown so out of proportion that we see a situation where people dont even know what they are fighting for or why. Dont believe me? Try to trully believe that majority of players read quest log or any game lore in any form.<br />
<br />
It's bad for developers because they cant possibly create content at the same rate people consume it, much less faster than they consume it. That's simply physically impossible and even if it would be it would be inheriently unproffitable. Right now we are at a state where people finish newly updated content in a manner of weeks, month if lucky. There's no way in hell, purgatory and heaven Blizzard can produce content at that pace. NO ONE is capable of production content at that pace! There must be something that slows players down to make them consume that content in a much slower rate.</div></div><hr />

It's not bad for developers if they can assign a cost to not running certain parts of content like therayeffect proposed. Leveling content has nothing to do with endgame, so why not keep it separate? The more choice the better and in this case it would make the publisher money and make a certain subset of the gaming populace happy.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spotnick</div><div class="date">2012-08-13, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason for the XP increase was that people were dinging 90 in Kun-Lai without even touching Townlong Steps or Dread Wastes. Blizzard wants players to explore the entire content of the expansion they sold to their customers.<br />
<br />
I leveled to 90 on the beta, did full Valley of the Four Winds, Kun-Lai Summit and Townlong Steps.. the only zone I didn't complete was Dread Waste when I dinged to 90.. so I really don't get how people could level to 90 in KLS.<br />
<br />
Unless of course they did pvp and dungeons. But by questing, I was almost out of content. (Jade was offline, so I had the instant grant to 86)<br />
<br />
I have no problem with leveling, but it seemed perfectly paced to be, took me about 30h to go from 86 to 90, same rate as Cataclysm. So unless they boost the quest xp, I think it's going to be a long boring grind.<br />
<br />
And I heard a friend saying somebody who only quested ran out of quests to do up from 85 to 90.</div></div><hr />

With account-wide mounts, every alt you ever made would have 310% flying for free had we not made that change.

Well they have &quot;stretching out grinds as long as possible to keep people subscribing&quot; down to an art form by now. *sigh*</div></div><hr />

Just 83-85. Levels 81 &amp; 82 remained unchanged. Still, it's a step in the right direction for making it easier to level through the Cataclysm content.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to do it, I want to be 90 as fast as possible so I can get to doing what I do like and that's raiding.<br />

Yes we have a player that skips the leveling on day one and then proceeds to consume content. He is done for a week and begins to whine on how little content this game has (ignorant to the fact he chooses to ignore bigger part of it). What now? Also how big is this &quot;certain subset of players? As far as I see it we have no bigger outlash for leveling being too long or painful. Remember the whole &quot;not enough interest to make spending resources worthy?&quot; Here it applies as well. If you can prove me that a meaningful group of players hates leveling in a game which bigger part of IS LEVELING then by all means...</div></div><hr />

Did you farm a lot of mobs in previous zones or what?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zeekbabz</div><div class="date">2012-08-17, 06:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fun fact here. Before the upadjusting with experience you would need a clever route, on the race to servers first. You would need to handpick your every move, and play it smart. Now you end up doing ALL quests, and you will still end up roughly 6.5m short at level 89. That means you will need to kill mobs for the last 6.5m experience, call tell if srs or trolling. Now they will probably ask us to do dundgeons for the last bit of experience needed. Yeah man thats cool - if we just level as a group, we will be 5 at level 89 ready to finish it off. Oh wait - with the increased experience required, you also need the individual monster kill experience - so you will be punished even further.<br />
<br />
There really are two solutions to this. Either you add more quests/upadjust the experience gain - or you simply make dungeon leveling to 90 viable.<br />
<br />
And stop ruining the game, plZ</div></div><hr />
