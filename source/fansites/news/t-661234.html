And there's always youtube for video.<br />

But I've good hopes for worgen either way, so I think you're safe :P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Can't wait for Blizzcon. However, I think you should stop saying that Goblins and Worgen are the new race. It will only take credit away from this site when it turns out they are not the new races. Goblins have always been the neutral race in WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here, I'll say it as well then, just to annoy you.<br />
Worgen and Goblins (http://rrvs.blogspot.com/2009/07/goblins-and-worgen.html) have a good chance at becoming playable.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they let more people work on the new xpack, so blizzard can show us something at blizzcon (if there's a new xpack ;) )<br />

<br />
Goblins are neutral, even the ones who &quot;work&quot; for the horde are paid to be there. Not to mention, it doesn't seem like there are more than a couple classes that would fit the Goblins: warrior, mage and warlock maybe, I guess DKs.<br />
<br />
Worgen make NO sense considering...they're evil...<br />

I think I'd laugh my head off if there's not even an expansion announced. But then, I'm a sick little human being.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They did.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it was a few days After the Goblin and Worgen masks were datamined, and clearly not to the same quality. This is what's made most people think they were only added at all to try and cover up the obvious screw-up of adding the Worgen and Goblin masks to the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wondering why this news site is using this kind of wording. Shouldn't you be saying something like &quot;new expansion... speculation of two new races being Worgen and Goblin...&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally I think Goblin is just silly. Leave them alone; they are an awesome neutral race and it just doesn't make much sense to ally them with either side. I think the bigger question is, does WoW need yet another race for each faction? There are plenty as it is.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, that's not what I think, but be careful with your arguments, such as to not let a glaring hole in them pass through.<br />
<br />
Now, first of all, all the nay-sayers. Stop it. MMO-Champion has a history of very accurate predictions, and as such, doubting them isn't the wisest of choices.<br />
Anybody even remember the whole &quot;Patch 3.2 is this week&quot; ordeal?<br />
For Christ sake, that was about a week ago!<br />
Tons of people yelled out how it couldn't be, and then, lo and behold, it was.<br />
Where did those people go? You don't hear a peep from them about the 3.2 patch after it came out, and I dare say the same will happen if they announce the new races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regardless, I don't see goblins fitting in with anything else going on. 3.2 included a teaser about druids that strongly points to them adding worgen as a playable class that can also be druids. If only one faction gets worgen, what other race would the other faction get for druids? Certainly not goblins.<br />
<br />
I don't think I've heard anyone interested or excited in playing goblins, whereas everyone and his little brother wants to play a worgen. If they put goblins on horde it would be a &quot;we don't want anyone rolling horde anymore&quot; move, and I'm not sure the population counts support that kind of antagonistic spacegoat-style move.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think it is very healthy for people to be skeptical. My main point is that until Blizzard announces it, it is speculation even if that speculation is backed up by inside info. For that reason, it makes sense to use language such as &quot;alleged&quot; or &quot;suspected&quot;, because if someone reads mmo-champion and sees &quot;the new races are....&quot;, they might be led to believe it was already announced by Blizzard as official - and it hasn't been.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Races are, afaik, a lot easier to add to the game than a new class. With DKs still being tuned heavily, the odds of them dropping yet another class in are pretty small. A new race would fit to come up next. It will be less work and a faster expansion turn-around time.<br />
<br />
Most people will expect a new class or race to come in a new expansion, otherwise you're just getting some more levels and raids, which is a harder sell. BC had new races, LK had a new class, expect the next to be a new race, and a new healing class to show up in the expansion after that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i would say the chance of them adding another class at this point is pretty much zero. <br />
new races are possible, but they're still a huge strain on the art team.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beachcomber</div><div class="date">2009-08-10, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am curious as to why you keep saying the goblins are one of the new races. You seem to be basing this conclusion on the addition of new halloween masks (and there are other new masks as well).<br />
<br />
They are already in the game as a neutral faction, it would be very unlikely. They are also ugly and unappealing, which Blizz is decidedly trying to get away from on Horde side to balance populations (see: Blood Elves).<br />
<br />
The worgen logic is better, as there isn't a female worgen in game and the mask would favor this assumption.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However I believe it is not at all out of the question to see new races and a new class. It would be a huge sale point. As for what they might be?<br />
<br />
Races are a hard call, especially Worgen. They were virtually unknown to the main population till the hunter pet fiasco. Did blizzard begin making this the race immediately after this? Unlikely. Did they have this in mind all along? Also unlikely. the mask IMO is more likely something to screw with people due to all the hype, much like all the pandaran hype. Goblins have more credibility, especially with the work-in to they speculated expansion's direction. With new races keep in mind a couple things.<br />
<br />
Starting zones, though I admit I have seen some pretty logical ideas for these.<br />
Racial Mounts, I've yet to see any speculation on this racial must.<br />
<br />
The other supporting evidence were the &quot;player animations&quot; that worgen and goblins have. Keep in mind there are effects already in game that cause players to change into goblins and worgen, this alone is reason enough for those animations.<br />
<br />
(Pirate Goblin, and the debuff in grizzly hills that turns target into a worgen briefly.)<br />
<br />
I will agree a new glass is almost a sure thing. The teaser conversation with the druids is strong evidence that a healing hero class is on the way. I'll admit I didn't initially see the worgen work in at first through this, but I think it's still a stretch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deepone</div><div class="date">2009-08-10, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Worgen for alliance is one of the dumbest ideas for a new race I've ever heard of. I'm hoping this is a joke.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm still iffy on buying into the Worgen thing. They could have been added to the holiday event to draw of suspicion. Goblins make sense. WoW has had plans for the Goblin Undermine since launch (see the map on WoWwiki) and Goblins have consistently been everywhere.<br />
<br />
That being said, I don't expect there to be an alliance or horde race added this expansion. If anything, I expect a neutral race, hence the massive effort de-factionalize (cross-faction xfer, multi-faction PvP realm accounts, etc.)<br />
<br />
No, I think you'll at least see horde AND alliance goblins (you'll choose at character creation), and worgen are possible, but I would not bet the farm (the female model certainly does seem detailed, but hey artists tend to like their jobs).</div></div><hr />

A new class is very unlikely. Blizzard has had a lot of trouble re-balancing Paladins and balancing the addition of DKs I think they're looking for a breather on the class balance thing.</div></div><hr />

Worgen are jsut savage and not necessary evil ... but ye, worgen in armor would look odd, however I'd love to see the race added. And goblins are mercenaries, they seem to have a tighther connection to horde than to alliance. Could quite well be that some splinter cartel of goblins join horde for good, without any impact to existing world.<br />

The wording should be somewhat different though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
LOL.<br />
<br />
Here is WoWinsider's article on the subject:<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW.com has learned through multiple sources close to the situation some details on the next expansion, to be called World of Warcraft: Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
As we're getting into the season of news and information, all major leaks and spoilers will be happening after the break. If you don't want your surprises ruined for you, don't read this post. If you want to know, click after the break and enjoy. This policy worked well for us during the testing phase of Wrath of the Lich King and we're pleased to continue it now.<br />
<br />
After the break, the new playable races of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Our sources have told us that the new races of Cataclysm will be:<br />
<br />
* Worgen – Alliance<br />
* Goblin – Horde<br />
<br />
This information has been speculated upon by multiple places, and we're pleased that everyone's speculation has turned out to be more or less true.<br />
<br />
You can find out more information about the Goblins and Worgen from WoWWiki, as well as from previous articles we've written.<br />
<br />
They have &quot;sources&quot; (&quot;Dude, don't taunt him, he has a GRAPH!&quot; [5 points if you tell me where that quote is from]). Their info is no more credible, less so in fact, than MMO-champion's. We'll all know in 2 weeks so speculation is pointless really. But who the heck ever said that Bou can't be wrong? Someone in a previous post said something to the effect of &quot;we'll regret our skepticism&quot;...like Bou is gonna come to our house and beat us over the head for not believing him.</div></div><hr />

More than Blizzard? Yea, I'm skipping that one.<br />
<br />
Its all speculation, even the Cataclysm is speculation (granted its a good possibility) but NOTHING is confirmed yet. We don't know IF there will be new races, or WHAT those will be. The masks are all ANYONE is going on at this point and that is not proof. I didn't think the others were any lower quality than the goblin and worgen masks.<br />
<br />
But for all the claims about these 2 races, I've not seen a SINGLE person satisfactorily explain how they would work lore-wise. I've already posted my thoughts on the races but I'll reiterate: Worgen are evil. There is one group of &quot;worgen&quot; who are friendly to the Alliance (in Pyrewood villiage), but these are only friendly during the day while in human form, at night they turn to worgen and are hostile once again.<br />
<br />
Goblins are neutral, there are a few goblins (zeppelin masters, etc.) who are friendly to the horde, but they are not part of the horde. They are paid.<br />
<br />
The only way either of these races make sense is the possibility of some event related to the next expansion that changes all of this, but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

Transfers are NOT related to this discussion at all. Those things are business decisions that change over time. Such things would change in the hands of ANY developer with a game as popular as WoW. Considering that Blizz is the company that, well, MAKES THE GAME, their word is who we'll trust as to the CONTENT of said game.<br />
<br />
As far as worgen are concerned, its more of a possibility than I would have thought before, but it's still a pretty major stretch. Plus, as that article clearly says, the worgen is a transformation. The actual person is still a human, they go through a transformation at the full moon. So how would this be a playable race when they are only in that form at night?<br />
<br />
Goblins are NOT allied with the Horde, where is this info coming from. They are neutral, always have been.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they aren't only worgen at night. Do the quests in WOTLK. Also, that might help you nail down why Goblins are on the horde. In Isle of Conquest they wouldn't risk their lives on their front line fighting the Alliance just for a small bit of money... they're Horde allied.</div></div><hr />

Allegiance<br />
<br />
There appear to be some goblins still working with the Horde found in Ashenvale, Orgrimmar, Camp Mojache, and Thousand Needles; even then, goblins working for the Horde run the zeppelin system. Recently goblins have joined the Warsong Offensive, some even displaying the Horde symbol on their tabard.[1] [2] and fighting on the front lines.[3] Also, there are a handful that seem to be in the pay of the Alliance, such as the SI:7 agent Renzik &quot;The Shiv&quot;. However, the RPG says these are mercenaries or merchants making money off the Alliance or the Horde to work for them, or by selling stuff to them.<br />
<br />
Other goblins are found in the employ of the Burning Blade, and the Black Dragonflight. <br />

<br />
<br />
I know this. Point i was making is that they seem to have given up on WOTLK already and pushing 3.3 then moving onto 4.0 and the new xpac. BC lasted a long time and had a LOT more content. 3.2 is great if u want to play alts, or if u want ez mode epics. But theyre relying on raiders to continue playing in Ulduar since 3.2 is all about casuals and pvp. ToC isnt MGT...<br />
<br />
This patch isnt really progressing WOTLK like they usually do. Chances are 3.3 might be hard for raiders fighting Arthas but wont have much else going on, i get the feeling 3.2 was for casuals and 3.3 will be back to raiders. This patch seemed to change classes a bit, and i can sense that theyre happy with &quot;balance&quot; for now until the next xpac. I cant see them changing much in 3.3 except maybe a couple tweeks. <br />
<br />
Just IMO. Blizzard wants more money from selling xpacs instead of patches, and they want to bring back players who left already.</div></div><hr />

World of Warcraft in-game pet codes will be mailed out 6 to 8 weeks after the event along with redemption instructions. As a reminder, the pet is not redeemable in all regions (see the FAQ for details), and a Battle.net account is required for redemption.<br />

It's interesting how expectations sway our perceptions. I read the WoWinsider article and immediately thought, &quot;nameless sources, eh?&quot; But of course, that was because I already have firm opinions on the expansion and how it will play out:<br />
<br />
http://essays.ajs.com/2009/07/world-of-warcraft-cataclysm-maelstrom.html<br />
<br />
It will seriously bum me out if I'm wrong about that. I was really looking forward to the introduction of a truly neutral race, and it really does seem to follow their sudden desire to facilitate cross-faction transfers (a difficult thing to implement, and with not much in the way of major benefit if it's not needed for the xpac).</div></div><hr />

Point is, whether you do or don't like Goblins/Worgen for whatever reason, there are many clues pointing to them being playable, and those clues have been around for years. When Draenei came out, everyone blew up with rage because of their random addition. Now, no one seems to care because there are still those other 4 Alliance races to choose from.<br />

My prediction is that if they become new races, no one's going to care after a couple of months. Their place in the lore makes prefect sense; no retconning is needed.</div></div><hr />

And were completely asleep during the pre-BC race arguments where a lot of these arguments about Goblins/Worgen were debated by those who swore black-and-blue that Draenei couldn't possibly be the Alliance race because they were allied with the Blood Elves who had already been confirmed as the Horde race.<br />
If you play the game and do the quests, Worgen are the subject of on-going attempts to cure them as well as being thought to have over-run Greymane, an entire nation that very well could have solved the blood thirst issue itself but -gasp- not the transformation(!) There could be giant playable fruit tarts behind Greymane Wall for all we know, magically conjured by their sorcerers in an attempt to moisten the Scourge. If Blizzard want to do it, they can explain it. Maybe the Scythe of Elune was found and they are all under intelligent direction now, or maybe something has gone wrong in the dimension they're from and they crashed their dimension ship during the escape.</div></div><hr />

There's not reason they shouldn't be &quot;related&quot; and it shouldn't reveal a MAJOR shift in Blizzard's priorities and philosophy (thus providing fuel for the new race rumors).<br />

http://www.wowwiki.com/Goblins:<br />
&quot;Old friends, the goblins fought with the Horde in the Second War, but broke off when they realized that it's more profitable to work both sides. However, many goblins remember the fun of the Horde and are willing to lower mercenary prices to Thrall and his people. Goblins offer almost exclusive transport services for the Horde, whether in their steamboats or zeppelins. You’re more likely to find a team of goblin sappers, who take great pleasure in the chaos the Horde creates, meshed into Horde forces than those of the Alliance. Perhaps with enough persuasion, the goblins could be convinced to rejoin the Horde for the first time since the Second War (although that could be just as harmful as helpful, knowing the goblins).&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure, Goblins have decided to serve both Alliance and Horde because there is more of a profit, but who's to say that there isn't a faction willing to fight alongside them once more.<br />

People keep ignoring the biggest piece of information: The Worgen masks. The male's face has a model never before seen. They went out of their way to create a female one. The female Ogre mask that was shown after was taken directly out of an RPG book while the female Worgen is a completely new, and rather detailed, model. Also, the Worgen models in game have almost complete animations for everything any other class does, from a crafting animation to a mounted one. There are ALSO many hints that Worgen will be the new race based on dialogue from someone in Dalaran, who says that the Worgen could possibly be tamed.</div></div><hr />

People also seem to be ignoring the very real possibilty this was all just to screw with people after all the hunter pet hype. Remember that Worgen lore-details, while present, were largely unknown by most people until this time.<br />

There is reason enough for this with effects that cause players to become worgen for a period, such as the debuff in grizzly hills from the worgen in arugals new tower.<br />

Remember that Worgen lore-details, while present, were largely unknown by most people until this time.<br />
<br />
How do the release of the Halloween masks &quot;screw&quot; with people &quot;after all the hunter pet hype&quot;? They don't. What the do, and did, is create new-race hype. Your point would be feasible as &quot;what if they did this to create new-race announcement hype before Blizzcon?&quot; except it can't be, because once that hype started they immediately tried to cool it down and deflect it by releasing more, ostensibly rushed, masks.<br />
There are many lore details largely unknown by most people in the game. The Broken were one of those. Guess who's now playable.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is reason enough for this with effects that cause players to become worgen for a period, such as the debuff in grizzly hills from the worgen in arugals new tower.<br />
<br />
There are very many effects that cause shapeshifting into another race, most being significantly more available and with longer-lasting effects that do not have these animations. Ones such as the Vrykul stand out, which you have not only for an entire chain of quests that are central to the lore of Ulduar and a daily hub, but you assume the transformation every time you simply fly over the area - a transformation that not only lacks a looting animation, but has a mining animation consisting of the Vrykul bending over in a pose that mimics every single player race's looting animation! <br />
<br />
The vast majority of transformations either have no animations beyond standing, sitting, and attacking, or those that they do have are directly related to mob/npc behaviours - such as the ogre dance. There is reason enough to have those animations, yes, but Worgen transformations are few and far between, with a comparatively low-saturation of mobs in the game world - and the evidence of more commonly available transformations with larger mob populations having virtually no player-accessible animations argues clearly that simply having a transformation is not enough justification for Blizzard to make player animations for it.</div></div><hr />

Of course they do (or can rather). Blizzard saw, as we did, The sudden uproar of novel popularity the Worgen recieved after the bug was discovered to have one as a hunter pet. Most of the supporters were people who did not even have any idea what a worgen was aside from a wolf that stood upright. The hype was even self-created as Bliz removed them as pets the the only reason many of the more irrational supporters woulda ccept was their self appointed reason is bliz was going to add them as a new race and could not have them as pets for that single reason.<br />
<br />
It is not out of character for bliz to toy with such popularity in one form or another. So the masks could have simply to that purpose alone. I suppose the phrase &quot;screw with&quot; was based of my own personal perspective in the reaction they are getting. All this will they wont they. When very view admit the equally likely chance that they had no racial intentions what-so-ever for any of those new masks.<br />
<br />
Also, the Broken are not playable, the Draneai (proper) are. The broken are sub-species of sorts (the 3 tailed, tentacle chinned guys). Now assuming you meant draneai when you wrote broken I wil lgo on to say that a great deal more was known about them than the worgen. Also after the blood elves and the setting of outland was announced they were also the most logical choice fitting in -arguably- perfectly to the expansions setting.<br />
<br />
While I write all this keep in mind I am not against Worgen being a race, I just remain fully unconvinced. Our friends the space goats has much more going for them during speculation time. I'd like to see more reasoned points made as to how they might fit in to the also speculated setting of maelstrom, possibilities for their racial mount, starting zone and more debate on why they would be affiliated with one faction or another.<br />
<br />
I left out your comments on the shapeshifting / animations bit in the quote but I would like to respond by saying: You are right, however; when it comes to programming details such as these Blizzard is consistently inconsistent in how they treat things on that level. So it is hard to use it as evidence for either side I suppose.<br />
<br />
As it stands all models that have these animations can be used by a player by one means or another, but not all models that can be used by a player have these animations. Take that as you will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you offer examples of previous times they've done this outside of April Fools?<br />
<br />

<br />
Up until BC the Broken were the Draenei. There was no &quot;proper&quot; form, there were no sub-species. That was invented to explain why players could play a species that lore had established was deranged and uncivilized because of the their separation from their home-world and to tie their species to the Eredar. Of course, Draenor is not really their home-world now, so that's now explained by genetic degeneration caused by whatever.<br />
Pre-BC a great deal less was known about the Draenei, despite them being central players in the Orc backstory, because they weren't important anywhere else. Within game there was a handful of quests for them in Swamp of Sorrows, virtually no other NPC mentions them at all, and all their lore took place entirely in the Frozen Throne. Compare to the Worgen, who have two entire zones and a dungeon dedicated to their story as well as a massive quest line explaining their origin in Vanilla, plus Wrath's introduction of the Wolfcult in yet another zone and quest line.<br />
<br />
And even you say they were the most logical choice, which is something I agree with as I argued that then (though did not see the space-goat change coming!), there were plenty of people who argued otherwise with less evidence than these masks and the same amount of firm belief that their choice was logically superior.<br />
<br />
<br />
While I write all this keep in mind I am not against Worgen being a race, I just remain fully unconvinced. Our friends the space goats has much more going for them during speculation time.

<br />
Starting zone would obviously be a small township in the Greymane district. Other than that I agree that there's very little supporting evidence to tie them into the assumed expansion-content beyond the masks. Goblins make sense for Maelstrom because Undermine is closer and could act as a base of operations, but IMO Worgen would make much more sense for the Emerald Dream, as it would be very easy to tie these extra-dimensional baddies to the horrible yet up to this point vague things going on in there, especially with the established lore between the Worgen and Night Elves.<br />
Beyond Goblins the only other race tied to the Maelstrom, and therefore a clearly better choice than all others, is the Naga - who have game-design handicaps beside being established as completely evil and hating the Night Elves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was doing some thinking earlier and thought of a make-shift tie in for the Worgen, (I'm still not convinced but I see some of the evidence in new light).<br />
<br />
Perhaps these Worgen (with their minds intact from previously mentioned pseudo-cure) wish to seek out a full scale cure. To do that they might want to send a party back to the Worgens true home and learn more about them. With very few options perhaps something tied to the maelstorm could serve as a possible gateway there. Or at least magic at it's center could help in the creation of such a portal. As for a tie-in most of the infected were humans and with their mind intact someone could vouch for them and take responsibility for their entrance to the alliance (much like Sylvannus did for the Blood Elves). The pre-maelstorm world events could lead in to this with some event causing a shift in leadership that would make the alliance more accepting of this idea.<br />
<br />
Neesd fleshed out but I see potential i nthis if its the direction we are going.</div></div><hr />
