This change is a few weeks old but as far as I know I never reported it and a blue posted something about it on the customer support forums. You can no longer get a Realm First achievement if you just transfered on a server! <br />
Any player who has been on the realm for longer than 60 days is entitled to a realm first achievement. In this particular case, the matter was investigated thoroughly for all parties involved and everyone who was entitled to the achievement should now have received it.<br />
<br />
The reason it was changed was to stop players practise on one realm then transfer over to a newer realm and get the achievement, potentially blocking the players on that realm who have been there longer earning it themselves. <br />

Core Hound Pup - Updated Video<br />
Someone pointed out that I never posted a video of the Core Hound Pup in Patch 3.3, this is now fixed! You can get the Core Hound Pup by linking your Battle.net account to an authenticator.<br />
<br />
Buy an Authenticator on the US Store (http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100000822)<br />
Buy an Authenticator on the EU Store (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221003617)<br />
Buy an Authenticator for your phone on the Mobile Store (http://mobile.blizzard.com/)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that buying an authenticator is always a good idea. <br />

The MMO Report: Thursday, December 17th<br />
The MMO Report (http://g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/tag/3321/The-MMO-Report.html) is a weekly podcast by G4 TV (http://g4tv.com/). They mentioned MMO-Champion in this week's episode (yes, that's all it takes to make me happy) and I might post it more often depending on users feedback ... It's always useful to know what's going on in the MMO world, ask for it and it will be back. <br />

TheSpeedGamers - Pokemon Marathon<br />
You might remember TheSpeedGamers (http://www.thespeedgamers.com/) from the Final Fantasy Marathon I posted a few months ago. They're back with a Pokemon Marathon for Ally's House (http://www.allyshouse.net/) this time! It will end on Monday at 06:00PM CST, be nice and remember that every dollar counts! <br />
<br />
<br />
The marathon has ended! Thanks to all the donators! Check TheSpeedGamers (http://www.thespeedgamers.com/) website for further update.<br />
<br />
From TheSpeedGamers (http://www.thespeedgamers.com/)<br />
Details regarding the 72 hour Pokemon Marathon that starts on December 18th at 6 pm cst:<br />
We, TheSpeedGamers, are a group of gamers who play video games to raise money for different causes. We have been a group for nearly two years now and have raised approximately $100,000 for various causes.<br />
Our events typically last 72 hours in which we broadcast ourselves playing video games while also giving commentary. There is a chat room that accompanies the video game feed so that the viewers can interact with the players and each other. Three games will be featured at a time, we will rotate the games being shown. Everything can be viewed on TheSpeedGamers.com.<br />
<br />
During the Pokemon marathon we will be raising money for Ally’s House while trying to catch all 493 Pokemon. There will be a counter so that the viewers can keep track of how many Pokemon we have caught.<br />
Donations will be gathered using a chip in widget; debit, credit cards and paypal can be used to donate.<br />
<br />
Gaming Rules:<br />
All Pokemon must be caught within TheSpeedGamer’s house, no trades will be done to outsiders,<br />
All pokemon that are only attainable through events only will be pre-loaded onto one of the carts.<br />
Games being played: Fire Red, Leaf Green, Heart Gold, Soul Silver, Ruby, Sapphire, Diamond, Pearl.<br />
<br />

I assume you meant 'lose the pet' at the end there. Interestingly you don't lose the pet if you used the Mobile Authenticator and remove it from your account (probably a bug).</div></div><hr />

so it's more traffic for them and more news for Boub to post! <br />

Plus it's fun to see how that &quot;WoW killer&quot; AoC is going. lol unlimited free trial.. desperate bastards, then again you can't expect much from people who won't allow people to cancel subscriptions or say anything negative about their game or you get banned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exploit? Frankly this is bullshit. After 55-ish days with my guild, I raided with them day and night every single day to get first on the realm to get Trial of the Grand Crusade. Imagine my surprise when blizzard told me &quot;sorry, you're NOT going to get your title, nor any feat of strength&quot;. I was the only paladin capable of stunning the shadow strikes and the guild praised me to high heavens for having a quick learning curve in the first place when it came to this task while still keeping a very high dps. <br />
<br />
Seriously. I did not serverchange to &quot;exploit&quot; anything, f***ing hell. I didn't even know there was a lockout period for this kind of thing. This wasn't worth mentioning in their Server-transfer-FAQ? Nothing important, no? I f***ing deserve my Feat of strength and title, but no - I'll be left without it<br />
<br />
Real good move blizzard<br />

Oh well, I guess I'm not doing icc with my guild now, GJ blizz! I recently transfered to get away from some bitch who I ignored, and would make trial accounts to harass me with &gt;_&gt; so I changed server and faction to get away from her-- cause even if blizz banned her main account, she'd use a friends or make a trial account. BEcuase I basically told her she was an awful GM and raid leader (she would only do bosses in ulduar which dropped HER gear) and that as a druid,. if she wasn't top on overhealing she wasn't reallty doing her job, sh ewas just sat there slacking. So she flipped =/<br />
<br />
Now my current guild will just think &quot;Oh she wont' get the achieve, lets take someone else.&quot; We have one lock =/ he's destro, they take him for CoE, they take me because I'm aff... however they'll just take our shadow preist with worse gear and dps now because of this... If they even manage to do a raid for once -.-<br />
<br />
Sigh, 60 days is just too much =/ I don't even have 60 days played on my 80, only on my 79 druid... hell I never even had a servr first before because guilds coudlt' be bothered this one sat down and said 'we will down Arthas first on the realm'.... psh.

Unless you mean some other realm firsts, this shouldn't affect you. It will likely take more than 60 days from now for you to get down heroic Arthas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think 60 days is too much for individual real first achievements. Now that all servers have the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj opened (including new servers) a time limit is not needed.<br />
<br />
But there should be an indefinite time limit for raid achievements. When a whole guild moves to a particular server and then gets the real first Algalon or KT or Lich King or whichever achievement then it is obviously a deliberate and coordinated act just so that that guild can exploit an achievement intended for people in the destination server.<br />
<br />
I am sorry but if you can't do first it on the server you are on when the achievement is introduced then you can never have it. If there are more progressive guilds on your server and they get the &quot;realm first&quot; then that is life and you dont get it. That is what realm firsts are for.</div></div><hr />

If there are more progressive guilds on your server and they get the &quot;realm first&quot; then that is life and you dont get it. That is what realm firsts are for.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
indeed 60 days is bit too long.. imo to be able get those achivements you gotta be created on that server or played there about 20 days.. or about total 60 days being on server ( not played but having done 60 days ago transfer ) and hell its so annoying when an uber cool guild which failed on there own real to get achi xfer to new one just to pull it out and steal it from that realm best guild =/</div></div><hr />

It is a very valid concert and there is no need for name calling. There are a gazilion of charitable organizations all over the place.<br />
Is this a web site dedicated to charity or pokemon? How is that related to World of Warcraft in any way?<br />
<br />
I suspect that mmo-champion gets some money from this, but if you prostitute yourself too much you start loosing visitors. This pokemon stuff was over the edge.</div></div><hr />

You do realise MMO-Champion is supposed to be dedicated to just more than WoW? However, for whatever reason (too much work, I guess) most of the information is for World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

In this particular case, the matter was investigated thoroughly for all parties involved and everyone who was entitled to the achievement should now have received it.<br />
<br />
The reason it was changed was to stop players practise on one realm then transfer over to a newer realm and get the achievement, potentially blocking the players on that realm who have been there longer earning it themselves. <br />
<br />
On my last server, we had &lt;Numen&gt; join our server, i heard they were one of the top 20th guilds or something in the world. They got a free realm transfer, did Algalon 25m and Yogg Zero 25man realm firsts. As we're a newish server it was annoying that both encounters were beaten by this guild. <br />
They transfered off the realm within a week, and left us with only Anub 25man heroic achivement.<br />
<br />
I don't think 60 days is that long, honestly, if you're new to the realm with a whole guild, you don't really deserve realm first achivements right away as it isn't where you formed your guild and started progress. Stealing progress from new realms is simple, so i'm glad Blizzard added this now.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am sorry but if you can't do first it on the server you are on when the achievement is introduced then you can never have it. If there are more progressive guilds on your server and they get the &quot;realm first&quot; then that is life and you dont get it. That is what realm firsts are for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not every server was created in Vanilla wow, and not every guild on brand new servers have people playing for years and getting used to hard tatics which decreases their time learning new encounters as they experienced bosses like this before.<br />
<br />
It's all about progress, i think even if you're behind on the world of progress, you should still be rewarded for your efforts. I don't think if you didn't get the achivement within 15 days of a new encounter being released then you don't ever deserve it. <br />
I still think achivements and progress should still be a server race for them. Back in Vanilla wow, we had horde and alliance speaking to each other, racing on progress.Letting everyone know what % they were on with Rag, and bosses in BWL, so we were all excited in rushing to wipe/clear a boss if it meant we gained the lead with only 1 kill or a different phase. <br />
<br />
With what you're saying above is, &quot;if you don't kill things fast enough, you fail and don't deserve anything.&quot; Server first is designed for each server, for players on that server to compete for, not for other servers to come steal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karot</div><div class="date">2009-12-21, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Kosic. Sorry for those that can't get it when they're not trying to exploit it, but there are far more that do exploit it, which warranted the action on the part of Blizzard. With all those guilds exploiting this (aka guilds that run away from the competition to less-progressed servers for realm first kills/titles), does this fix really come as a surprise? Or did you think that Blizzard would continue to allow these people to &quot;achieve&quot; realm first when they were never really denizens of that server? Is that really fair? No. You may think you &quot;deserve&quot; realm first titles for being all &quot;hardcore&quot; but you should have been &quot;hardcore&quot; enough to do it on your original server.<br />
<br />
If you transfer now, you'll probably have more than 60 days before you're able to do Realm-First LK kills. So I really don't understand the QQ reaction to this.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Pokemon rulez. Especially the newer ones. Playing the old ones just feels too clunky. They definitely improved on them.</div></div><hr />

But seriously S E V E N has been active on Detheroc since Mid-Vanilla and we're finally the premier guild on detheroc, and The Gong show came and stole our thunder. I have nothing aginst them, and my guild feels the same way, but you can't help but feel slighted by that.</div></div><hr />

You wouldn't be saying this if you were in my shoes. Worked my ass off for Grand Crusader title, 5 days until 60 day lockout is over. We make the kill. I get f*cked over by the lockout. Considering I was instrumental on stunning Shadowstrikes and making sure that the offtank can do his job, as well as rotating the HoP-ing for our paladins and pushing out 8k dps despite doing a dozen smaller tasks - I believe I earned my title. I sure as f*ck didn't transfer to Terenas to steal anyone's title.<br />

<br />
Frankly the thing you described about Numen happens so rarely that No, the implementation is not warranted - 60 days *is* too long. Someone on the In game support forums made a good point - put up a rule that says &quot;15 players have to be older than 60 days on the server for the lockout to wear off for those who are still under the 60 day ban&quot;. That way you get around the &quot;whole guild transferred over to take our achievement&quot; and you won't screw over people like myself who actually EARNED the god damn title.<br />
<br />
Furthermore. They retroactively changed the server transfer arrangement, this did not exist when I transferred. Furthermore they did NOT include this in the European FAQ, only in the US FAQ. How often do i go on worldofwarcraft.com? Never. I go to www.wow-europe.com because it's dedicated to my part of the world.<br />

Unlike what some of you people may believe, some people play the game because it's a fun and original RPG experience and not because &quot;aww lots of little cute and furry animals&quot;. Seriously people, use your damn brains for once. Try to compare Pokèmon to any other RPG and see if you can spot any similarities. Yeah, that's right, they're not that different.<br />
People try to show skill in video games to raise money for charity and all you people do is complain... You guys should be taken out back and be shot in the head. That's how much jerks you guys are. Go take a hike.<br />

Also, DLC stopped being funny ages ago and I only read it these days waiting for an epic gem to reveal itself from the artist. He kinda lost his touch, I guess. Teh Gladiators are always funny, though.</div></div><hr />

I was the only paladin capable of stunning the shadow strikes and the guild praised me to high heavens for having a quick learning curve in the first place when it came to this task while still keeping a very high dps. <br />

Seriously. I did not serverchange to &quot;exploit&quot; anything, f***ing hell. I didn't even know there was a lockout period for this kind of thing.

<br />
Rly i can feel you brother, i also didn't get my title because of fucking 5-6 days. There is a thread in the official Blizzard Forum about this situation, there are many people with the same problem like us. One of them got his title by a GM so I think it is possible to get our title aswell <br />
