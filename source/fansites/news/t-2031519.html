Rygarius Leaving Blizzard<br />
Our favorite patch writing hippogryph (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Rygarius_(CM)) is leaving Blizzard (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/755827336700801024). We're sorry to see him go and wish him the best in the future!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Master Loot &amp; Guild Master Loot<br />
Using Master Loot in 7.0 requires that you have a &quot;guild group,&quot; which is the same definition that is used for things like Guild Achievements or Guild Challenges: 80% or more of the group must belong to the guild. You can definitely bring a couple (or several, for larger raids) friends along from other servers and the like.<br />
<br />
Is the appeal of Master Loot the convenience of only one person needing to check the corpse and then assign everything out? I'm a little perplexed that the reaction has been more &quot;welp, guess we can't bring our friends anymore...&quot; rather than &quot;welp, guess we can't use Master Loot as much now....&quot; I'd imagine there isn't much of a real concern about ninja-looting in a group of guildmembers and friends that raid together on a regular basis, or is there?<br />
<br />
I know Personal Loot has been viewed with some skepticism by guild groups over the years. Originally it was due to the drop variance, where you could potentially get 0 or 1 items from a large-raid kill, which felt terrible. We fixed that in Warlords. But even then, being unable to trade loot around to gear up a friend, or pass an item to someone who needs it more, held back its appeal. In Legion, we've made more major improvements to Personal Loot, most importantly including the ability to trade any item that isn't a strict Item Level upgrade to other people who participated in the kill. So if you have (or have ever gotten, post-7.0, even if you no longer have it) an ilvl 720 trinket, any trinket drop you see that's 720 or lower can be traded to others in your raid group. And you still get the benefits of &quot;smart&quot; loot (e.g. never seeing a shield drop if you don't have a shield-user in your raid). Maybe it still isn't the right fit for your group, but I'd encourage people raiding Hellfire this week to give it a try - we've love to hear feedback on how it feels, and what could still be improved. Thanks!<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.0.3 - Dungeon and Raid Nerfs<br />
We've made a few more tweaks to abilities that were unaffected by Demoralized (e.g. Wrought/Focused Chaos) because they were &quot;friendly-fire&quot; damage. Those hotfixes should now be live, and will be documented in hotfix notes later today.<br />
<br />
Raid Finder should also now be receiving a weaker form of the Demoralized debuff (many of the changes that the Normal/Heroic/Mythic version is offsetting involve things like high-end raid trinkets that aren't as commonly present in Raid Finder).<br />
<br />
That said, having seen how Normal, Heroic, and Mythic have played out over the course of the first day of the patch, raiding has been easier in some ways (many combat times are a bit faster, even if on-pull burst is slower), but harder in others (healer throughput is more stressed, old methods of handling some mechanics are no longer reproducible, etc.). That's not the intent - were definitely aiming for &quot;slightly easier&quot; across the board. We'll be increasing the magnitude of the Demoralized debuff later today, and will continue to keep an eye on content.<br />
<br />
We're also looking at introducing a form of the debuff to Warlords dungeons (Mythic especially).<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - July 19<br />
Here you'll find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the recently-released World of Warcraft Pre-expansion Patch. Some of the hotfixes below take effect the moment they were implemented, while others may require scheduled realm restarts to go into effect. Please keep in mind that some issues cannot be addressed without a client-side patch update. This list will be updated as additional hotfixes are applied.<br />
Additional information about the patch could be found below.<br />

and yet its not due to its nature - yes you can trade loot but ONLY if it has lower itlv then the piece you ALREADY have - for gearing up purposes its still complete garbage as you cant gear up people that you want to gear<br />

its a disaster for pugging scene very few decent players will do raids now that they have alternative of mythic + dungeons where they dont have to carry scrubs just for sake of creating group.</div></div><hr />

If you haven't done any pugging then you'd notice every fucking group would be like &quot;Tier tokens reserved, weapons reserved, trinkets reserved&quot; and all that shit.</div></div><hr />

So the small chance that someone gets an upgrade that isn't ideal and would pass it off is somehow worse than the small chance of, say, a raid with no shield users getting shields, thus ensuring a shard?<br />

That comment you referred to was just a very bad justification of the camera change, since then we've had one post capped thread on the beta forums and several on the general wow forums, and since that first blue post there hasn't been a single comment about the feedback</div></div><hr />

I suspect the Master Loot change was a way for them to combat paid gearing services rather than just simply abuses of the system. A lot of the gearing services would be just a handful of people, and they would fill out the raid in the pre-made finder to 30 people then funnel gear to their carries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, considering the fact that Mythic progression raiders that spend hours and hours preparing and researching are wiping on bosses they've had on farm for the better part of a year, it's no surprise that LFR is affected... <br />
<br />
Everything's tuned and balanced around Legion, raids are no longer tuned around our toolkits. It's entirely natural.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i normally agree with this sentiment but it is odd at the amount of people (the people that are usually fairly responsive to their playerbase) that have been leaving recently.<br />
<br />
im not saying that WoW is a sinking ship but theres clearly been a philosophy shift, a design shift, or something within the past couple years that has led to these people to search for other jobs. in some of these guys' farewell posts theyve been pretty heavy regarding their decision to leave with one of the CM's writing a mini novel detailing how much he loved it there. <br />
<br />
from what i can tell blizzard treats its employees pretty well and is always on that list of best companies to work for. i can understand wanting to always move up the ladder, make more money yada yada yada, but some of the people that have left had been with the company for 5-10+ years. it just seems odd to me that the way they all proclaim to love the work environment and the people, to just up and leave it to start out at the bottom of some other company.<br />
<br />
maybe im just weird. if i worked somewhere that i truly enjoyed the work, and loved the people i worked with, and was having no problems financially, i'd just stay there. anyways this'll inevitably get spun into &quot;youre a conspiracy theorist&quot; or a &quot;rat leaving a sinking ship&quot; post.</div></div><hr />

If you aren't a guild group, other Group-Loot-based methods remain available for your use in raids (both Need/Greed and FFA). Obviously that opens the door to ninja-looting, which is why I asked about that concern in my first post. But if you aren't worried that one of your friends/guildmates is going to steal something and vanish, then the only loss is the slight of inconvenience people needing to loot items off a corpse, or having someone trade items around to whoever's awarded them. I of course understand the desire to avoid any inconvenience, and we've tried to minimize the impact on static raiding groups, but we feel that curbing harmful uses (and abuses) of Master Loot in pickup groups is a benefit that offsets those costs.<br />
<br />
Though if Blizzard actually gave a single lick to moderate such issues they would not be happening as often.<br />
<br />
I like the simplicity of PL and it is a far better feature than initially launched. Still not a fan of Blizzard turning a blind eye to their own policies.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, that seems like a very minor concern.<br />
<br />
And? You the individual pug are benefiting from that guild run, or at the very least raid leader's experience. If they want to form a group to seek an individual piece then join them or not. Removing the Master Loot option is a garbage move and will just lead to fewer pug players being invited to guild runs so that the Guild can maintain it's 80% ratio.</div></div><hr />

That's more likely because ppl like him and the other two guys were not going to get much of a chance at a promotion at blizzard when they could leave and go be something else than a community manager. <br />

How do you know the circumstances of his departure? You don't, therefore you can't draw any conclusions. He might have been fired for all we know. Or if he wasn't why do you think his position was all he ever dreamt of and was going to stay at for life? If you dream posting in the social media to be the peak of your career realization, maybe he didn't. And he is going to have a damn good background with &quot;Blizzard Entertainment&quot; as his previous employer. <br />

I know it's still an option. I was explaining why, for me, I prefer master loot, since the Blizzard guy posting it seemed to not understand why you wouldn't prefer personal. Also was making a joke that recently they've made sweeping changes and assured us that we'll enjoy it.</div></div><hr />

Personal loot is perfectly acceptable now that you can trade. Most guilds will still use master loot for progression.<br />
<br />
<br />
As i guild I’m totally disagree on PL, too many items lost for no reason.. on PL you don’t have the option to give item for OS if a MS don’t needed, ofc takes more time until you give the loot and special when ppl don’t reply fast enough if they want it or not (last year’s day by day ppl want to rush everything) for pugs i totally agree for PL if you don’t know/trust the leader, otherwise ML is the best for the previous reason i mention. I hope Legion won’t affect the loot distribute system for guilds.</div></div><hr />
