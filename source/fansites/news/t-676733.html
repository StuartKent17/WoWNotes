Kick the laggers, no need for those in top-end guilds. If one knows how to configure their internet and their mom isn't downloading porn at the time of the raid, you don't have lag issues.<br />
<br />
Also, stop being a bad interrupter. There's no such thing as &quot;unfortunate shadowstrike&quot;, it's a fucking failed interrupt.</div></div><hr />

^^ This. Unfortunate interrupt misses are only unfortunate because the person who missed it failed. Even people with the most stable connections go LD from time to time, but this shouldn't be the case so often that you constantly lose people to it.</div></div><hr />

Because service providors never have any issues, and hardware (eg. routers) never do either right?<br />

And a failed Shadowstrike can still be unfortunate. Of course, I'm sure you'll link us all your &quot;pro&quot; achievements to prove how you're far better than everyoen including Ensidia ;)</div></div><hr />

RAWR I&quot;M SO LEET!<br />
<br />
Anyways beyond your douchebagery, there's nothing you can do if you happen to play on an overpopulated server with terrible lag spikes. So you pray to god that you don't get hit by one at a bad time, or you either try to find the least laggiest time to do ToGC. <br />
<br />
The real solution would just be making achievements that don't depend on stupid gimmicks like this. That way you don't get F'd in the A because someone's internet or the server decided to crap on you.</div></div><hr />

FC is really the only one that worries me, other than the internet connection boss.<br />

<br />
I don't think FC is too bad. We are a pretty decent guild, we clear to Anub on 25 TotGC each week. We never got to him with no wipes, but we have killed FC with no deaths a couple of times. It just depends on the FC comp you get.<br />
<br />
Last week, we had the worst possible comp and it took us around 10 wipes to complete it. Other times, we can 1 shot it.</div></div><hr />

I'm myself in a guild wo got Heroic 5/5 and managed some Hours ago to fail @ Insanity with 49 left (hooray @ stupid Twins Wipe..-.-) and can't quite understand how people lose people at FC.<br />
<br />
I think its now 4 weeks in a row that we killed FC 1st Try without someone dead, and we really had quite some different comps.<br />
<br />
Dunno, perhaps its just luck, but i think, of all encounters in TotGC, FC worries me the least to lose someone dying.<br />
I'd rather go with Twins. Anub itself also isn't that much of a problem to survive with 25 people...</div></div><hr />

Not at Ensidia but mainly for the problems any world first causes. It brings out the EU vs US trolls. Now honestly, does it matter who gets a first? You can argue all you want, each side gets its own fair share of firsts. The funny thing is that the people who make remarks like &quot;US IS BEST HAHA SUCK IT EU&quot; or &quot;EU back on top, as it should be&quot;...even if it were a competition....those people saying those things most likely are not contributing to either sides progression. Its usually some douche who plays a DK who is in a guild that struggles to clear normal TOC every week who think that if they hang out on mmo-champion...they must be good right? Wrong, you are an idiot who adds nothing to these forums or debates. <br />
<br />
For the record, I play on a US server. It pisses me off equally when US screams these nonsense claims they are better. So I am not picking a side. Its ashame that news like this gets lost in the nasty EU vs US debates. So again, congratulations Ensidia.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you have any experience of failover situations, even the fastest layer 3 failovers will cause a few seconds without any traffic while the backup waits for a defined timeout before it takes over. Layer 2 failures will take longer in most architectures to reconverge. So in other words absolutely no one in the world is immune to lag and dc's. <br />
<br />
Your example is quite silly of course, as most people don't have 2 routers in their house to configure, nor the experience and knowledge to do it.<br />

I know alot of ppl have commented on this but OMFG lol no melee hahahahaha. Even if that could be even possible (its not possible, Everyone that have done ToC and ToGC know that its not possible because if you remove all melee ppl there wont be enough &quot;bosses&quot;) its still legit unless Ensidia hacked into blizz and changed the fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now to ppl saying &quot;this is easy why dont anyone have this achivment&quot;. lol its without anyone DYING (not a wipe) its really hard to achieve, 1 bad combo on clothi on FC or lots of bad orbs and a missclick on anyboss = someone dies. Or getting a fire and a snowbolt at the same time (unless you use levitate bug) means death. <br />
<br />
<br />
So it is hard so BIG GRATS. Anyone taht ahve done ToGC know how hard this is.<br />

Keep waiting. Achievements, and &quot;gimmicks&quot; as you calls them have been the bench mark for progression since WoTLK release. It isn't changing. ICC normal mode will be cleared<br />

If you haters only knew how silly you looked. Let me tell you something, saying shit has very little power. Besides that, it's much more likely to get on the nerves of the masses (like me) than Ensidia. Get off your ass and do something or shut the fuck up. Seriously.<br />
<br />
Or wait, I have an idea! How about everyone who posted in this thread so far that had something negative to say about Ensidia/their achievement make a guild together. I mean, with all that hate (if you guys are able to stay in a guild together for a week) you're sure to be the best guild in the world! AMIRITE?<br />
<br />
No...actually, you could all be the best players in the world, and your guild would still suck. So instead, your ass has to get carried by someone with sense so you don't burn every bridge before you get across it.<br />
<br />
Some of the stuff I'm reading is so idiotic it doesn't even make sense.<br />

Other guilds only haven't gotten this because they've had bad luck?<br />
Well alright, let's say that's true...if they'd had good luck (and obvious skill) we'd be congratulating them! What's your trip? Butt hurt 'cause you had an unlucky lag related wipe? Get over it.<br />
<br />
No melee on FC?<br />
ROFLMFAO! Do you raid? Or are you getting paid to troll? My guild can't even down the first boss in ToGC 25, and even I know that you always get 3 healers, 3 melee, and 4 casters. Every. Single. Fucking. Time. Clear ToC 25 every now and then...you'll see.<br />

Bare in mind you are playing a game that was developed and made in &quot;LOLamerica&quot;. I haven't enjoyed a game that was made in Europe since...oh wait thats right...there hasnt been one. I won't debate US vs Euro in a WoW competition because thats something lame to debate. But with anything else US &gt; Euro.

Now don't get me wrong; I'm not trying to give you a &quot;How to: Faction champions Immortal&quot;, because quite frankly this stuff is probably obvious to anyone. What I am trying to say though, is that I find it fairly unlikely that they did this without outright excluding a couple of classes from coming on FC.

<br />
As for whether it should be counted as progress or not, I seem to recall people ranking guilds in T7 based on glory of the raider which included Immortal. The only difference is Naxx was piss easy so even random deaths didn't necessarily mean failure while ToC is another story. That doesn't mean it shouldn't count, however. <br />
<br />
If you're going to rank guilds by insanity, which is also extremely dependent on people's connections, then there's absolutely no reason to not rank guilds on immortal. The time to draw the &quot;too dependent on connections and therefore unreliable as a measurement tool&quot; line was after Mad Skill. Too late now. <br />
<br />
Besides, I'm pretty sure that if we had every guild with insanity post their logs for this week, &quot;dc deaths&quot; wouldn't even account for half the failed immortals.</div></div><hr />

The time to draw the &quot;too dependent on connections and therefore unreliable as a measurement tool&quot; line was at Mad Skill. Too late now. <br />
<br />
<br />
i could see that argument if you were ranking individual players...<br />
<br />
but what else is a guild EXCEPT connections ?<br />
<br />
next you're gonna say that the people in the raid didnt REALLY get the achieve since they had 24 other ppl carrying them.<br />
<br />
it doesnt matter WHAT the goal is, if 25 players can achieve something that no other group of 25 players in the world has... then that places them a cut above.</div></div><hr />

I think we're on the same side lol...<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think insanity or immortal should be counted as progress (I don't even think skill or mad skill should either, since after you kill the boss who the hell cares how many attempts you need to rekill him?). Since insanity was, however, immortal should be too. None of the guilds with insanity had any problems telling those without it that it's not all about connections and to suck it up and try again next week since bad rng doesn't last forever. Well, that applies here too.</div></div><hr />

Apparently some people saw this as me attempting to criticize their achievement. I'm just congratulating them on being the first to accomplish this feat without any of those problems. I mean - Ensidia themselves even changed servers because of those issues on their previous server.<br />
<br />
I would wager that there have been a few times - probably for Ensidia and for others, that a DC or someone's lag spike cost acquiring the achievement.</div></div><hr />

once you are geared and practiced enough, the only fight where a death may occur would be h faction champs.<br />

DICE.<br />

<br />
<br />
This is exactly the point. Look at anyone with the titles Death's Demise or Grand Crusader. You know one thing - they've achieved something that a precious few have. Even more so with this mount really seeing as one single death is much much harder to prevent than one or more complete wipes even with gear. I've sure seen people in full Ulduar gear die in naxx10..<br />
<br />
On another note, who gives a flying fudge about whether you label this as &quot;progression&quot; or not. It's a damn hard achievement and they managed to do it first, end of story. My guild is working on Twins HM atm and it'll likely take us a couple more weeks to get Anub down and really see anything close to a tribute chest. <br />
<br />

1. What the fuck does WoW being stable have to do with disconnects?<br />
2. There are 25 people in a raid, all it takes is ONE disconnect per week. Get it? ONE? I'm sorry should I restate that in Roman numerals? I. I. You know, the number one?<br />
3. You say disconnects has been the excuse of scrubs since Naxx, just what exactly have you accomplished? Where's your Tribute to Immortality if your internet is so reliable? What's wrong?

(Why do people care so much about how much some guilds plays, if they get payed, if they work, if they got red hair etc. This has ZERO impact on your gaming experience. Enjoy the game the way you want. The whole &quot;No life...&quot; is a crappy argument as well, since most of the top end guilds kill stuff faster than the average players/guilds and probably end up spending less time over all.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those who claim the game is hard because this achievement took so long to complete : <br />
<br />
So are we judging how hard is the game according to the various achievements that might be in it? That's totally stupid. The game's difficulty depends on the difficulty of the bosses and not on the way we defeat them. For example it doesnt matter if i defeat anub arak with my eyes closed, or with my one hand behind my back or with 25 rogues in the raid or with not anyone dieing. What matters is that the boss is dead. I can come up with 12309853 such stupid achievements just to make the game &quot;difficult&quot;. Does that mean it's actually difficult? I dont think so...</div></div><hr />

<br />
In a raid of 25 people it's very possible for a different person to Disconnect each week<br />
<br />
I totally agree, I've been in no raid in which less than 1 different person has disconnected...</div></div><hr />
