We're doing our Cataclysm preview on the death knight changes later this week, but we knew one change risked overshadowing all the others, so we figured we'd go ahead and drop the proverbial Blood bomb today.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm, death knights will have a dedicated tanking tree, much like the other three tank classes. That tree will be Blood.<br />
<br />
We’ll go into more detail in the upcoming preview, but we wanted to take the opportunity to explain the reasoning for such a big change.<br />
<br />
Why the about face? We actually thought the “tri tank” experiment worked out okay. We suspected there would always be a “best” tanking tree, because that’s the way these things shake out, but we hoped it would be close enough that many players could tank with their favorite tree. When we tried out this design for Wrath of the Lich King, we were using it as a test case to see if we wanted to do similar things with the warrior and paladin talent trees.<br />
<br />
A lot has happened since that time. We introduced the dual-spec feature, allowing players to have a tanking spec and dps spec that they could switch between. We introduced Dungeon Finder, which makes it easier to find players who want to tank, and even let players level up using a dedicated tank spec. In Cataclysm, we are introducing the concept of passive talent tree bonuses and we think that feature is a lot stronger when the talent tree has a particular focus (such as damage, tanking or healing). For example, it’s safer to give more passive damage to a tanking tree than we can a dps tree. Above all, we were just spending a lot of effort trying to balance three trees (though it was really six trees, since each tree was trying to do two things).<br />
<br />
It started to feel unfair to the other tank classes that we had to spend so much effort tweaking three types of DK tanks, and it even started to feel unfair to the DK that we couldn’t focus their tanking experience. One bit of feedback that really struck home was the DK players who said, essentially, “I look at the Protection tree and I’m jealous of all of the cool tools they have to help their tanking. As a DK, I have to pick and choose tanking talents from within a sea of dps talents.” Rather than have a strong focus, the trees felt a little watered down because they were trying to do so much. With Frost as a dual-wield, spell and runic power focused tree, Unholy as a disease and minion focused tree, and Blood as a self-healing, defensive cooldown, tanking tree, we think the focus of each tree is a lot clearer and cooler.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm, Blood will be the death knight version of a Protection tree. It will have passive talent tree bonuses that reflect tanking. It will have tools, such as a Demo Shout equivalent, necessary for tanking. Several of the more fun tanking talents from Frost and Unholy will be moved into Blood. We will be able to revise (or even remove) clunky mechanics like Rune Strike and focus on letting DKs generate threat with their normal Blood tanking rotation.<br />
<br />
This is major change, and we understand it will be met with some disappointment from players who really liked the flexibility, those who appreciated the unorthodox talent tree design, or those few of you who really liked Blood dps. Nevertheless, we are convinced that this is the right change for the game.<br />

Would rather it had been frost as a tanking tree and DW was moved to Unholy tbh. But GC totally has a point, making a DK tank sucks talent-wise, so few tanking options and such a clanky threat system.<br />
<br />
This obviously means they will rework the presences ofc.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xaos</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An excellent change, we've suffered from the &quot;each tree for everything&quot; and the complications it caused with balancing tank/dps/pvp ..<br />
<br />
while its a shame for those that enjoy frost tanking the benefits of having a dedicated tree to tanking should hopefully ease their suffering.<br />
<br />
I personally cant wait, I've been blood tank more than frost due to it being better most patches for raid content.<br />
Cant wait to see what they'll tweak talent wise .. and if they'll drop DRW for a 51pt'er thats tank based :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
at the same time that i want to be able to have all 3 speccs be able to do it all its true what they say.<br />
<br />
our tanking suffers cus the trees are so mixed and its hard to balance a tree around being good for tanking without making it overpowered for dps and actually vise versa.<br />
<br />
however one thing i would like to see if they only use one tree is to balance it around being able to both 2h and dualwield in it.<br />
<br />
but i guess this is just an improvement. the only real tanking specc since like release of ulduar has been blood so i guess i wouldn't notice anything different more than i actually get more talents useful for tanking</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mean to rain on anyone's parade, but think about it...Bloodworms is probably gonna become your &quot;last minute&quot; talent with a hefty cooldown. Most of the other talents will be nerfed to bring them in to more unison with warrior/druid/paladin abilities, you'll probably lose a lot of that self healing, considering it's going to be a main tanking tree, thus...overpowered self healing would be seen as ridiculous. <br />
<br />
It'll be interesting to see what happens, but to those of you rejoicing thinking that you're going to be soloing heroics and be at the state you were at the beginning at WotLK...you thought wrong. There will be endless QQ over the next few months, as these changes come to light. I'm going to be glad when people quote this post and say, oh hey look he was right. GL DK's...GL.</div></div><hr />

Hell, I know most people loved blood and hated using the other 2 specs when blood was subpar. Now that blood is viable again, they turn it into prot. <br />

Lol. DKs get screwed.</div></div><hr />

I guess this will also affect the players who likes to level, pvp and pve as blood dps. But I acknowledge that it was stupid that DK's had 3 viable tanking specs where other tanking classes were left behind with just a single.<br />

<br />
A bit surprising, considering how the presences are aligned (which in themselves makes sense. Frost seems bulkier, of course), but talent-tree-wise, I'd say it was the best choice. Blood has had a bit of identity-problems from the start, feeling like a stronger (at times), but watered down Ret-Paladin, wanting warrior-gear and cap spellhit.<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see how they'll do with the presences, but... They've sure been busy during easter! Thumbs up.</div></div><hr />

Definitely looking forward to the new threat mechanic for blood tanks, and seeing what talents we get for them.<br />
<br />
I'll probably get slated for this next comment, but /care tbh. Maybe we'll even see a talent to *dare I say it* equip shields xD<br />
Yes, I know it's all part of the dk tanking mechanic to use a 2h weapon....but in my experience, it sucks seeing a plate tanking item drop only to read the stats and see the words: &quot;Block Value&quot; all over it.</div></div><hr />

I agree, frost tankings mitigation sucks and there are too many people trying to do DW (im a rogue usualy so i dont wanna dual weild anymore, you may feel otherwise), unholy was great prenerf, but now you dont put out enough threat. blood has some realy good mitigation, makes it easier on the healers, a few raid buffs, and threat is from optimal dps. i see no reason why blood shouldnt be the permenant tanking tree.

Because currently my dps rotation is very similar to my tanking rotation, which I find dulls the experience...a lot. <br />

I don't find having similar rotations/abilities makes it dull, but it does mean it can take me a while to notice if I'm using the wrong talent spec... ;)</div></div><hr />

That really turned me off for some reason.

used to frost? any good DK tank, in high end-game raiding guilds raids as blood, it's far superior with it's self-healing and cooldowns then frost -.-</div></div><hr />

Also, WOOOHOOOOOOO!!!<br />

Although Unholy has always been my favorite spec, this will make things much better balance wise for DKs. It was a good experiment with the 3 trees, but sticking to what works seems the better way to go about it this time.</div></div><hr />

Blood DKs will still be able to go into blood presence while not actively tanking. Bears would go into cat.<br />

Hell, I know most people loved blood and hated using the other 2 specs when blood was subpar. Now that blood is viable again, they turn it into prot. <br />

Lol. DKs get screwed.<br />

<br />
Blood and unholy playstyle is almost exactly the same just different names and better arp scaling which is going away in cata.<br />

This will be great for balancing and will probably help out dks for pvp and dps balance and they will have more talents to choose from for dps and tank.</div></div><hr />

They are gonna spend even more time changing the class because they had to spend much time tweaking it? Because it felt &quot;unfair&quot; to warriors and paladins that they were tweaking so much more on DKs tanking? Lol.<br />
The homogenization is now reaching alarming levels, and even worse, the change to fundamental design of a lot of classes and such is gonna wreck up balance and force them to spend way too much resources on actually balancing the chaos they've created.<br />
I guess I won't be playing my DK much in Cataclysm, since it basically destroys a lot of what attracted me to the class; the choice of playstyle.<br />
<br />
I'm actually pretty shocked about it, if I didn't know that April Fool's was a couple of days ago, I'd have thought it was a ridiculous joke. Considering that I've got all classes at lvl 80, I'm fearing for the other classes I've learned to play and love.<br />
<br />
I just hope they won't mess Shamans; I'm already sceptical with the dispel changes and the previous history of Shaman development. With this change in fundamental class design, I'm beginning to dread...</div></div><hr />

And to the people are sad they are killing your fun: It has been announced that for Cataclysm tanking class offspecs will be able to tank heroics with a bit of thought. That means Arms and Fury warriors can tank your heroics, and unholy/frost DK's will no doubt be able to do the same.<br />

<br />
I'm... slightly disappointed, but just that, no rage or anything. After all, they could be changing things so much that even if they did keep all three trees tanking-viable, I might prefer something other than my current favorite tree for tanking anyway.<br />
<br />
I've been playing since vanilla, and every expansion brings in major changes for just about every spec, let alone every class, and most of the changes have been enjoyable overall to me. I look forward to the changes to hunters, as I just haven't enjoyed playing my hunter as much in WotLK because of having to spend time in Aspect of the Viper. My first 60, my first 70, and my... 6th 80?<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying is that I'm not going into Cata with fear for any of my toons. Things will be different, but change isn't necessarily bad. Take the paladin class. There's people that are sure that paladins are getting horribly nerfed in Cata just because the class has always had rough transitions at the start of each expansion. However, I've been around, and I don't know a single paladin that would have wanted to go back to vanilla functionality after they got used to BC. That's also mostly true for WotLK, but a few paladins feel that their AoE tank roll is being infringed on by other classes in this expansion. So things got better, even if they tend to be OP at first and then get a little overnerfed, and then slowly put back where they should be.<br />
<br />
I'm good with that. I'll have fun in Cata, mostly because I don't expect everything to be the same but better.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LXIX</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One more thing: Can we expect to say good riddance to the talents that are deep into the other trees?<br />
<br />
No more acclimation? It was a fun talent that never got to see it's potential. <br />
<br />
What about the fun dps talents taken along with blood tanking? No more hysteria? No more abominations might? (Not saying you should take these but...) sudden doom? Blood worms? Dancing Rune Weapon? Those are almost solely dps increases. Will those go the way of the dodo?<br />
<br />
I just don't like the idea of everything being scrapped that had room for improvement b/c the lead designers are lazy.<br />

<br />
I love blood tanking, it's very unique and fun. But sometimes I feel very squishy (HoR is an example) and sometimes having very low aoe threat is not a great thing, now it won't be that way. Holding a 2hander and being the 1st guy to hit shit is just awesome ;)<br />
<br />
Unholy (2hander) and frost (duel-wield) as dps speccs sound perfect. Unholy is truly a unique dps specc to play (if you don't count blood dps :P), so I'll decide to keep my dps as unholy. If I want to play a duel-wield haste packed specc, I'll play my enha :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Annarion</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with having a specific tree for tanking 100% When Wrath was in beta, I was stoked to be making my frost tank. Then they started spreading shit around and it got more annoying. I've never been happy with my DK as a tank, and I've given up on it until Cata. Unless blood gets a lot of playstyle changes, which it wont, I'll not be tanking at all with my DK again. The one thing I did like about the variability in the trees is that I could both dps and tank as frost. Frost is the only tree I've ever cared about.<br />
<br />
Most of the comments in this thread regard trashy players not knowing what the fuck to do. This wont really solve anything, because you're still going to get unholy DK's DWing fast weapons queueing as tanks in Frost (Or Blood if they change it) Presence. As for &quot;the&quot; spec, I never had spec-related issues tanking as frost, and the other blood dk tank in my guild had no spec related issues as blood. Both were perfectly viable, blood simply outshone frost, primarily because vampiric last stand is better than lolbreakable armor. <br />
<br />
I honestly hope that they move the dual-wielding talents to the bottom(top?) of the frost tree to make them accessible to all three specs, and do more to balance the 2h damage vs dw damage. Dual-wielding should be a flavour choice, instead of a mandatory &quot;Frost is DW or go home&quot; choice. I personally love DW and will never give it up, but I don't think they'll make DW unholy or blood viable at all. Say goodbye to Rune of the Nerubian Carapace.<br />
<br />
Overall I am happy with this choice, since it makes my frost tree that much better for dps, and hopefully I'll get a better CD than UBA, not that it's that bad now. It also makes the decision to never tank again with my DK that much easier, since after trying all three specs, I absolutely fucking hate blood.</div></div><hr />

Naw, I'm just a blood dps DK that will miss his favorite spec (and I too have faced ridicule for sticking with a slightly weaker spec). But that's not the point.

I love blood tanking, it's very unique and fun. But sometimes I feel very squishy (HoR is an example) and sometimes having very low aoe threat is not a great thing, now it won't be that way. Holding a 2hander and being the 1st guy to hit shit is just awesome ;)<br />
<br />
Unholy (2hander) and frost (duel-wield) as dps speccs sound perfect. Unholy is truly a unique dps specc to play (if you don't count blood dps :P), so I'll decide to keep my dps as unholy. If I want to play a duel-wield haste packed specc, I'll play my enha :P<br />
<br />
<br />
Completely agreed. Everything.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thecapuchin</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 10:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, started out as a Blood DK at the beginning of the expansion. Loved it, went all the way through Naxx, OS and Ulduar as Blood. During that time, I was also the one DK in our raids that respecced regularly for OS3D in order to tank Sarth. I loved Blood and was very against giving it up at all. <br />
<br />
Then Blizz unscrewed Frost DW and made it playable and fun. I went DW through all of ToC and the beginning of Icecrown. Loved it, couldn't even consider that I'd try Unholy which I'd never liked at all. But then, I found that I was one of the few people in our raids that was going for Shadowmourne and that meant that I had to give Unholy a shot (we already had a dedicated Blood DK at that point) and once again, I loved it. <br />
<br />
Now I'm torn between Frost DW and Unholy and would really only consider using Blood to tank, which thankfully, Blizz has just confirmed will be the tree that I'll *want* to be when Cataclysm comes out for tanking.<br />
<br />
People will QQ like hell now and then in a few months the whiners will be gone to other classes and those of us who like DKs regardless of the changes will be DPSing and tanking like we always have.</div></div><hr />

Always kept my idea of having 3 trees = For clearly the two aspects in game: PVP AND PVE<br />
<br />
PvE: Depending on the class:<br />
Hunter: Pve Lvling spec (BM) - DPS BUILDS AND BOTH SHOULD BE DOING DA SMAE AMOUNT OF DAMAGED IF MASTERED - Being both of those mere Damage dealing specs both as efficient in raiding and pvp if just like i said were both mastered...Depends all about you if ud go for surv or MM depending on yer tastez.<br />
Same would apply for other classes but Theres no bloody need for a stupid dual spec...... takes out da epicneesss and personaility and particularity of yer character...<br />

Yea there is going to be whining. They just destroyed 3 specs in one fell swoop! <br />
<br />
That's like saying it's okay for them to just wipe out a 1/3 of everyone Else's specs then smoking a pipe observing &quot;Oh if they really liked the (insert random class here) they should be okay with this.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, as was mentioned numerous times already - it makes no sense(or better yet it won't) using Frost Presence and having a Blood spec... I'm curious if the effects of Frost and Blood Presence are gonna get swapped or we'll just have to get used to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: and yeah, what gives with frost, the more tank feeling of the trees, with frost presence, not being the tank tree? Blood is the most DPS feeling of the three, and has blood presence which all three specs use for DPS. @$$ backwards yet again Blizzard.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sebubble</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If Blood is going to be the tank spec, then Frost and/or Unholy will be the dps spec, obviously. But what sounds really odd to me is this:<br />
A full tank/blood spec tank while being in frost presence<br />
Does that mean Frost spec will be in Unholy presence, and Unholy spec will be in Blood Presence?<br />
/popcorn<br />
<br />
<br />
lol you do realize part of the point of the presences was to let each spec tank, yeah? If you have a dedicated Tree for tanking you don't need an ability to prop up each spec to tanking health/armor (frost pres). If anything they will probably nerf the presences to be more like warrior stances. They won't be as important since they can just roll the bonuses into each tree via their talents or the new passive bonuses due to mastery.<br />
<br />
It's about time they stopped this nonsense. Trying to balance a class to have 9 viable specs (tank/pvp/dps x blood/frost/unholy = 9 math bunnies!) when they can barely get some classes to have 2 viable specs is ridiculous. Could you imagine their trying to do the same with Paladins? That would be 12 specs and they'd probably break 3/4 of them while wasting development time trying to get them right. Of course, it's bad enough I have to wait till the 16th to see what they have done to my class yet again lol<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about feral. It's not the same Issue. They only have one tanking tree to choose from. Sure it's mixed with a melee dps tree, but that's a lot different than having to pic from 3 trees mixed with dps with various &quot;flavors&quot; of melee. The melee of feral versus the ranged of balance is a more defined roll.</div></div><hr />

This change is f'in' welcomed. I am not a huge fan of all the normalization and homogenization goin' on, but hell I am tired of all the Dual Wielding Unholy DKs queing up as tanks. Hell, I was tired of bad DKs three weeks into WotLK. Thinning the herd FTW.<br />

<br />
i hope that for frost, they buff 2H dmg for the spec so frost doesn't turn into, HEY DW TREE SPECZORS go frost plz. also with unholy, be interesting if they could had DW viability.<br />
<br />
am i going to miss blood as a dps spec? yea kinda....actually no i'm not. if i wanted to dps as blood, i should've made my warrior/pally my main.<br />

They just said that they're going back to tree specialties instead of trying to make every tree do everything, just be satisfied that they're being so up front with the upcoming changes. <br />

<br />
okay so i guess i see where your coming off as me being upset, though i'm glad they are making the changes. i guess i'll miss the exploration of DK dps in WotLK...seeing unholy DW, then seeing 2H frost, it was a fun road.</div></div><hr />

you should read the post more carefully - blood is going to be the tank tree, not unholy oder frost... ::)<br />

DK tanks could never have mitigation talents or mechanics completely on par with the others until a dedicated tanking tree was made. Giving it to DKs while all three trees were still capable of decent damage would have a negative impact on PvP. And god knows people wouldn't have that.<br />
<br />
I am pissed that they chose Blood over Frost though. If we have to suffer through Blood they damn well better give Blood DKs a way to take snap AoE threat similar to Howling Blast.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">M1kra</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the reason Blood was picked for Tanking was the self healing abilities. A tank who got some type of healing income (other than normal Healers) will survive better than Tanks who can't heal at all.

<br />
I think that from an outside point of view not playable.. Maybe it feels different from the inside GamePlay of a Dk, I think Blood should be the PvP Spec (Blood: Stmaina..Healing....Resilence....Hunger rage kinda those :))<br />
Unholy: DPS Spec!!<br />
And Frost for sure da Tanking Spec of our Dreadful Plate Cold Wearer....<br />
I think things should be revamped Re-made and make it fit that way... I understand that guys who play dks feel blood is better bettter but come on if they would put all of da things that u people like and the style u like that blood posseses on more understandful specs (FROST).....Frost make It at least ....at least.... Making it sensable? I mean common sense::::<br />
<br />
Unholy: DPS<br />
Blood: PvP Resources<br />
Frost: Tanking! Duh!!!<br />
<br />

<br />
Anyways it's prolly a good change but it feels silly that blood will be a tanking tree with frost being a tanking presence ^^ Like making warriors tank in arms spec with prot stance and making prot tree a dps tree ;o<br />
<br />
<br />
If anything blood should be a pvp spec. Why are you healing yourself in a raid? That's the healers job.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blacktempest</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those who like PvP, this is just awesome. The biggest issue that Death Knights have is that they can effectively tank as DPS which meant that damage had to be tamed to compensate. Now PvP Death Knights will be more fragile but that gives the ability to hit like a truck. Control + damage is almost always better than being a PvP tank.<br />
<br />
Without the tanking talents to clutter Frost and Unholy, there will be more options and more PvP talents to choose from. PvE will have more options as each style will have more talents to choose from.<br />
<br />
As for killing three playstyles:<br />
<br />
1) Blood DPS is the least popular DPS spec and has the worst group buff.<br />
2) Unholy Tanking has been dead since Ulduar. Can't kill what is already dead.<br />
3) Frost Tanking will be missed. But top end tanks are already Blood.<br />
<br />
With this change, I am confident Death Knights will remain a great class for PvE and now has a chance to great for tanking and PvP as well. Bravo!</div></div><hr />

hysteria, surely is awesome, but the 10% ap is bought by MM hunters aswell, and enhancement shamans... so not rly required, unholy is the only spec that brings a debuff to the raid that's unique, and helps all classes with disease, and magic, noone else needs to keep that 13% magic debuff up :3</div></div><hr />

I love Blood DPS and Frost makes way more sense as a tanking tree.<br />

Probably,<br />
I do hope they keep the healing component :P A tank that provides his own heals simultaneously would be awesome!</div></div><hr />

i believe i'm correct on this one, http://wowhead.com/spell=51161 (http://wowhead.com/spell=49632), and that one works for shadow priests diseases does it not (im 99% sure im correct on that one), and yes, DK's bring it on an aoe scale so it works out better anyway</div></div><hr />

I suppose we'll have to wait and see just how much the damage is when they announce how they're moving the talents around.</div></div><hr />

I mean, Blood is my favorite tree of the 3, just because it isn't used as frequent in arena or in pve doesn't mean you need to change it! Man! WTF! :@ <br />
<br />
Now everybody going to sound so damn grey, i.e some new guy asking what's the best tanking tree for dk, and everyone will be saying Blood. What, was the tri-talent class too much too handle Blizzard? EVEN FOR THE LIKES OF YOU? Good Bye Creativity. <br />

each tree has excellent defensive, offensive abilities. No sense not filtering through a tree just like prot/feral and moving applicable talents into it.<br />

I think people did not actually read &quot;Several of the more fun tanking talents from Frost and Unholy will be moved into Blood.&quot; <br />

<br />
10% attack power raid wide buff and 20% physical damage increase for 30 seconds to any raid member is the worst buffs?<br />
<br />
<br />
How about a rephrase, something along the lines of - Blood has the best raid buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
10% AP vs 20% melee haste vs +13% magic damage that was easily spreadable. Which ones are more powerful? Unholy is far more valuable for raid buffing. Not even close. Frost is second because the only other source is Enhance Shamans which are rare. <br />
<br />
Marksmanship Hunters also bring the 10% AP buff and they are very common. As for Hysteria, Blood DKs are balanced on giving themselves the buff. It's like tricks for rogues where they use it mostly on each other. Most of the time, they used it for themselves. This isn't rocket science.<br />
<br />
If you're going to contradict me, you might want to think about your answer first. There is a reason that despite the fact that Blood DKs do equal or slightly better damage than Frost/Unholy that everyone is using Frost/Unholy. It's the buffs. They are better.</div></div><hr />

Lets just wait till Cataclysm hit the stores, before we jump to conclusions. Blood becoming tanking spec doesn't mean the other two will stay as they are now and won't &quot;evolve&quot;. I'm pretty sure Blizzard announced that every single talent tree is gonna get revamped.<br />
<br />
It is hinted for quite a while now, that Frost is &quot;the Dual Wield&quot; tree, and I highly doubt they'll force the only class that can(and was meant to) tank with a two-hand weapon use two one-handers instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To those who say that Frost should be the tanking tree it's important to remember that the 2-handed rune weapon is as iconic as glowing eyes for the class, which probably made it necessary to pick a 2-handed tree for tanking. If Frost had become the tanking tree it would have been necessary to shift all the dual wield talents into either blood (which didn't fit the feel) or unholy (which really didn't fit the feel) so that left either Blood or Unholy for tanking. Unholy had the minion control so tanking was given to Blood.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Death Knights were an experiment. You gotta be aware that changes are gonna happen. I honestly didn't like the whole 3 tank and dps specs. Just created talent bloat and tank just did the dps rotation with rune strike macro'd to everything.<br />
<br />
Now blood tanks can get unique tank abilities and won't have to do the same thing as dps, just in frost presence. I'm sure everyone will understand soon enough.</div></div><hr />

Yep, I'm one of them, Tho I hate Tanking in Blood and Love it in frost. (I have a Dk alt on another server who Is unholy for Pvp)<br />
I completely dislike this change, and I hope they change their mind (I never noticed a large difference in performance with tanking in blood than unholy or frost but a different play style. Sure Blood had a hard time with Aoe but at least It is Godly in single target, and Unholy is godly in Aoe [from what I experienced] while Frost was the more In between the two).<br />

<br />
<br />
He was talking about multi-target/aoe, so both are viable options.<br />
Frost dps rotation in general is pretty simple, although it's somewhat more proc-dependent than blood or unholy.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't mind this change. It is more simple to have a definite tanking tree, though it is kind of a shame that the versatility of having multiple playstyles as tanks is lost.<br />
I would probably need some time to adjust, though, as I'm currently tanking as frost and dpsing as blood, but that probably goes for all classes in this case.<br />
<br />
I don't get why some people get so overdramatic because of this. We don't know the details yet and most, if not all, classes will probably see some alterations in playstyle.</div></div><hr />

While I get why DK trees are a bit too polyvalent, I'm kinda scared Frost will become the &quot;whatever&quot; tree with a mix of tanking and DPS'ing talents that both tanks and DPS'ers will need to spec into for complementary talents (with the good stuff always being too far down, as per all classes). <br />
<br />
Blood DPS was just too good I guess, and instead of nerfing it into oblivion they're changing its purpose; not an entirely bad decision, even if I'm going to miss it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't say I am surprised, and overall, I think it will be good. I did like having to research the best talents from the 3 trees, and I really enjoyed the non-linear talent choices that differed from my old prot warrior in Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
At any rate, I can't wait to see all the woeful DK tanks running around with Blood Presence on in Cata.....<br />
Me: 'Hey excuse me mate, I noticed your threat is really low, are you in Frost Presence?'<br />
Them: 'No lolz, I don't know if you realised, but tanking tree is now Blood. Noob.'<br />

I always foresaw that they would need to change a tree to be pure tanking, but I thought that tree would be frost.<br />

Oh well, we adapt.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">azmodai</div><div class="date">2010-04-06, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright people clam down, this is getting silly.<br />
<br />
Putting some points on the table.<br />
1. You know only that blood is the tank tree, they haven't mentioned what changes are being made to the other trees.<br />
<br />
2. As stated in the OP the six specs for one class was an experiment for WOTLK and now they have the results. Maintaining effectively six talent trees for one class is silly. If you don't think so ask demonology warlocks or subtlety rogues how long it took for them to become viable in PVE / PVP. Even the playing field and have more time spent on the overall design and the rest of the classes.<br />
<br />
3. That said, they may radically change the other specs to become more fun. Iteration in design?! what is this madness. WOTLK is not Catalcysm so leave your WOTLK tuned rants at the door when you take home your boxed copy. You don't know what's coming. Designers are paid to make design decisions. Lots of changes are coming to every class so stay tuned.<br />
<br />
4. How many times have you changed specs in wotlk alone to tank or dps? We had the imba unholy tank, we had the no diseases blood spec. We had blood become a solid tanking spec, we had dual wield frost tanking bounce between good and bad, we've had countless scourge strike changes. Why are you so surprised when they said &quot;screw this for a game of soldiers, ONE tanking tree&quot;? Simple = faster = better. That's the rule of game design. In wrath alone on my warlock main i've gone from playing dominant affliction to dominant destruction and now I play meta because the buff is awesome. The game changes and so do you, enjoy it.<br />
<br />
5. All of this pales in comparison to what someone said earlier that the while the classes are homogenized we are still well away from classic and thus having two dps choices and a tanking tree is still quite good. <br />
<br />
In classic you had warriors tanks (only), pallies heal, priests heal, druids heal, hunters autoshot afk pull threat and die, shamans healed, rogues went stabby stabby, warlocks died summoning their doomguard when they didn't have a soulstone ready, mages had the bugged ignite rolling dps meters and that was that. Keep some perspective here. You don't want to go back to that.<br />
<br />
Just a note: I play a tanky dk with blood tank / frost tank specs to bring either buff when needed. They both have advantages and disadvantages. cry less and enjoy the game more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3/3 in d&amp;d talent in unholy tree, glyph and t10 2 set sorted.. have no issue holding 8k+ dps in 25man and the same in 10man as blood. frost is useless get over the DW thing and pick-up a proper tank tree.<br />
<br />
really hope from this day on people will re-roll blood to tank with and just forget about the other 2 tree's, this sucks for blood dps i guess i never dps on my tanky i have a pure dps class for that kind of thing.<br />

This poster speaks sense! Finally. YES the current trees are getting a change that would heavily impact your opinion on current play styles. BUT have you been to the future and tried it already?

Ok - I got a 3rd too<br />

Seeing as blood is also the only spec whose DPS style i enjoy, i don't like it.<br />
<br />
To all those 'wait and see the changes nub', what exactly do you expect to change about frost and unholy? Frost will most likely remain 2x 1h specialized (which I don't like) and i doubt they'll remove perma ghoul from unholy (i already have hunter, i don't want another pet class ty)<br />

<br />
The worst part is they're going to design the Blood Tanking around the assumed fact that they'll have the healing from Death Strike, and then if they don't have their diseases on a target they don't get healed and they die.<br />
<br />
Fuck blizzard is terrible.<br />
<br />
<br />
WAH! WAH! WAH! Go and quit then! Changes are always interesting. Nerf or buff.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blurr</div><div class="date">2010-04-07, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly I have to say, just by looking at some of the responses, what kind of community has the WoW community become? Some of the first responses are essentially &quot;Yay! Incoming QQ! Haha you suck!&quot; Really? Since when is it appropriate to be this much of a douchebag? Do you say to yourself &quot;Wow, some people won't like their class being changed, I should go be an asshole about it!&quot;? Grow up, seriously.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I'd have to say I feel this is a step backwards for not only the class but the game itself. I've always played a tank, and I love tanking. I tanked everything through the end of BC with my paladin, but never really enjoyed the class. Deathknights were a godsend for me, because I really enjoyed the flavour of the class, and I could pick whichever tree I wanted and still be completely viable as the main tank for my guild. I originally started out as a Frost tank, but soon found I liked Unholy better for the cooldowns. I had absolutely no problem MTing all of Wrath as an Unholy, even when everyone said you have to be this or that cookie-cutter spec. Unfortunately, now everyone will have to be the same cookie-cutter spec. There will be no more variety in DK tanks, you will no longer need to understand your talents as long as you have the same spec as everyone else. Rather than put in the actual effort to keep DKs as a multi-tree-viable tank, they're taking the easy way out. I find this is in keeping with the idea of the &quot;B&quot; team being in charge of WoW, what with everything being converted to badge farming, homogenization of half the game, a half-assed expansion on the horizon. Heck they're even going to give away the DK class mount via a loot quest now. DKs don't feel like a &quot;Hero&quot; class to me anymore. My DK really doesn't feel fun at all anymore, especially knowing that any choice I had in gameplay is essentially being taken away in the near future.<br />
<br />
Honestly it just feels like another step in the watering-down of WoW. It seems to me all the creative devs have been moved to more &quot;important&quot; projects.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">protohamster</div><div class="date">2010-04-07, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is anyone else disappointed by this sudden turn of events. The mastery preview made it seem like they had a very clever solution to this very obvious problem (that was pointed out almost immediately by the community) and said that it would be presented when the DK overhaul was going to be presented. After all this waiting and anticipation they issue this statement today and it's essentially a suggestion of the community that they took and a total 180 degree change from one of the things they said they liked about DK's the fact that they were going to try something new and different where each spec was capable of both DPS and tanking.<br />
<br />
Since that design paradigm has obviously been a mistake, here's another solution blizz. Don't make Blood the tanking tree, the logical tanking tree is obviously Frost. Continue to make Blood the physical DPS/self healing tree so it can work like an arms warrior while Unholy remains the spell damage/pet dps tree. Frost should be made into the tanking tree so that all those tanking 1 handers can get dual wielded for tanking DKs,much in the same way Prot Pals and Prot Wars wield a 1handed STR tanking weapon and shield. As a nice side effect, you don't have to design STR DPS 1handed weapons anymore and continue to make only AGI DPS 1handed weapons which can be used by Rogues/Shaman/Hunters.<br />
<br />
Also I doubt people are as attached to DPS DW Frost as much as DPS Blood/DPS Unholy, after all wasn't DW DPS frost only recently made viable in 3.3.3?</div></div><hr />

Are there still tank DK's? I never ever saw one since 3.3 in a random hc all where DPS. <br />
pre 3.3 I saw some sucky DK tanks. never one thats really good.<br />
<br />
Also blood is good for tanking since selfhealing is more usefull for tanks then dps since dps doesnt take the much damage. Also I wonder what they gonna do with frost keep it the DW spec or make DW usefull for all specs. <br />

With things like Uncrittable being talented in Cata it just wouldn't have worked to have all three tree's Tank viable, this is best for all as it allows Blizz to focus on making the Blood Tree a viable tank tree, without worrying about how it will effect Dps, and allows them to make Frost and Unholy Dps without throwing in tank talents for those that chose to spec that way.<br />
<br />
and tbh most DK tanks I see nowadays are Blood, and most Dps are either Frost or Unholy, so in the long run VERY little is going to change.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chin Music</div><div class="date">2010-04-07, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always saw Frost as the tanking tree. Frost Presence and the general motif of using Ice and cold to shield yourself was something that seemed natural to me.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that yeah, I liked Blood DPS a whole lot.<br />
<br />
Still this was probably a necessary change. Sucks though that now if I want to DPS with a two-hander I have to pick Unholy which is probably the least fun of all the specs. Hopefully this will at least make DK tanking feel more natural.</div></div><hr />

Currently I do play a frost DW DK tank and I loveit quite a bit. I love the feel of being able to Howling blast, I love the chime of my addon when I get procs of Rime and Killing Machine, I like that I can pop UA for a surge of threat as much as I can pop it for a surge of armor [which I admit, is not nearly as nice as either Vampiric Blood or WotN].<br />
<br />
I tried to blood tank and it didn't suit me. I didn't like the AoE, relying on DnD, then tabbing through my Heart strikes wasn't to my preferences, and I've always had a distaste for slow 2h weapons because it always felt too slow for me. People can talk about &quot;OMG, BLOOD IS HIGH END TANKING, FROST TANKS ARE NOOBS&quot; But playstyles are playstyles, and with with the accessibility of the game anymore it's not that great a problem for casual gamers or people who don't take raiding so seriously but still want to progress to be able to take specs that they're more comfortable with or play better.<br />

If a healer can keep me up without complaint but I can round up adds, trash, or groups better because I'm frost is there that great a problem?<br />
<br />
I'm just hoping that they do something to make blood at least more entertaining as a spec, and yes, though I feel like frost is more suited as a tanking spec. [in before, &quot;OMG BLOOD IS THE BEST NOW!&quot;] I don't see why they choose blood as the tanking spec right now instead of frost while trying to validate the choice as &quot;They have the better cooldowns&quot; If it still means they have to completely rework everything in the first place and move some of the talents from Frost and UH into blood anyways.<br />
<br />
I love procs, I love alerts, when I played my warrior tank I loved hearing Sword and Board Proc so I knew I could shield slam then and there. It's how I feel about howling blast right now. I'm glad they're getting ride of Rune Strike because frankly, a button that DK's macro into almost every move they have without having a major worry about RP for CD's is more a chore than an ability. I don't want to think that DnD will be the only AoE that a DK tank really gets either since abilities like Thunderclap, Consecration, and Maul are much more mobile. I always felt like Howling blast was a good way of getting some of that mobility without having to spec into something like Moribidity, glyphing for DnD, or keeping a 2pc Tier talent for the sake of better Aggro on groups <br />
<br />
All I can do is hope that with all they work out that it will in fact be for the better. That they create some way to fill in the gap of pleasure I took from being a frost tank when this is all through, because the change will not be a small one by all likelihood.<br />
<br />
So, in recap.<br />
<br />
1) Blood should have procs when tanking. The last thing we need is DK tanking having its own &quot;96969696&quot;<br />
2) Less reliance on DnD for AoE. Paladins are overpowered in this, as it's been said several times. Druids have a spammable button, warriors have Shockwave and Thunderclap. I think DK's should have something to make their AoE more mobile.<br />
3) Imp Blood Presence. This will DEFINITELY have to change if it's a tank talent. Which is one of the reasons why Frost seemed more logical. Imp. Frost Presence is much more valuable to tanking, so they might change the talents around. I can see blood presence becoming something more like, &quot;Hardens the blood, making the DK more resistant to injury.&quot; Or something where frost becomes more like, &quot;Covers the DK in jagged blades of ice that increase damage on a target.&quot;<br />
4) Hysteria finds a new home.<br />
<br />
Because, hey, we can be sad that we're losing our favorite specs. But at the end of the day it's a small announcement, we're not the only ones who'll be changed [look at the whole dispel thread after all], and in the end, we have no idea just yet how it's all going to turn out. But dear god, if they make DK's Sword and shield... &lt;_&lt; then the Q_Q can begin in earnest ;b</div></div><hr />

Not complaining though, this is a great step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been a DK Tank since I got my beta key. The only part of this expansion I missed out on Tanking was Ulduar, due to real life conflicts. <br />
<br />
I am really, really excited about the direction they're taking the Class. It's always been street dreams that we'd actually have 3 viable, competitive Tanking trees. It just doesn't work like that, especially when you factor in how many different variations of &quot;cookie cutter&quot; specs other Tanks have (I know of 2-3 different Warrior tank specs). <br />
<br />
Looking forward to whatever write-up they're doing. This was enough of a teaser to get me into Cataclysm!</div></div><hr />

<br />
On topic: Blood is the only viable specc for tanking. That's it. Frost tanking sucks balls and so does unholy.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shamslam</div><div class="date">2010-04-07, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did no one read the part where they said that they are moving talents from Frost/UH to blood...so you're more than likely going to lose nothing you liked...other than probably DW tanking. I'd expect a Howling Blast type move to MAYBE become the 51pt talent in blood (which honestly, giving blood HB and frost DRW wouldn't be so bad). <br />
<br />
I'm glad...I thought it was stupid that every tier I had to pick between blood or frost and focus frost for AoE and blood for single target. It was honestly annoying to have 2 tank trees and no DPS because I needed to swap back and forth for some fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's THE question.<br />
<br />
So blood is prot , frost is for dual wield and unholy is all about spell and minions ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Where did my awesome big bad 2h spec goes ???? :'( i guess it's time for me to reroll war so many change since day one as a dk <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
^THAT, just THAT !<br />
<br />
<br />
I.......I need a hug :'( I'm so sad right now.<br />

&quot;I love blood dps, now I will have to switch to frost/unholy and they're boring!&quot;<br />
<br />
You have NO idea how the death knight dps play style will be in Cataclysm. They are reworking every tree for every class so I wouldn't expect any class to play exactly like they are now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's a failed question, because with everything changing, blood wouldn't necessarily be the most fun spec anymore, even if they did continue the tri-tanking method.<br />
<br />
You people are basing a lot of your criticisms on a system that when the change finally comes, will no longer exist as you know it.</div></div><hr />

All trees for all classes are being re-worked to some degree, and these degrees will surely vary. Blizzard have said themselves that they're looking to make the trees more interesting and fun, and I'm sure they won't leave out any holes that are created with such big swaps between tree purposes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Failed statement.<br />
If I play a spec of a class right now, I'll play this spec to the next extension, because this spec is my long time fav, maybe this spec change a bit, but it's my spec...<br />
<br />
But what I'm suppose to do when my spec just disappear ? And when you hate the other spec of your class?</div></div><hr />

Not for the fact that Blood got the tank tree. What makes me sad is that DKs had one difference from other tanks that stood out, and made them enjoyable at least in my eyes. It was the fact that you can DW as a tank. If Blood ends up being the tank tree the odds are that it's going to be all about 2H tanks. If I wanted to do that I'd roll a druid. -_-;;;</div></div><hr />
