Emblems in Patch 3.3<br />
Bosses in Naxxramas, Obsidian Sanctum, Eye of Eternity, Ulduar, Trial of the Crusader, and all Heroics will drop Emblems of Triumph. Bosses in the Icecrown Citadel 10- and 25-player dungeon will drop Emblems of Frost. Choosing the Random Heroic Dungeon option via the Dungeon Finder (new in content update 3.3) and completing whatever dungeon is selected for you will award you with two Emblems of Frost the first time you do it (this is in place of the daily Heroic dungeon quests which are being replaced with weekly raid dungeon quests). <br />
<br />
Continuing to use the Random Heroic Dungeon option within that same day to complete dungeons will award you with two Emblems of Triumph each time in addition to those dropped in the instances. The random option can also select Heroic dungeons to which you may already be saved, so you can technically do every Heroic dungeon more than once in a day by continuing to use this option.<br />

Kirin' Tor Rings in 3.3<br />
Item level 251 versions are currently planned for patch 3.3. I'm not sure what the cost to upgrade is but it will probably be similar to previous upgrades. We are only upgrading the existing ring types, not providing a new one, so that means no tank version. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21035178083-are-the-kirontor-rings-being-updated.html))<br />
<br />
Tank Shortage<br />
The &quot;shortage&quot; is caused by a lot of people not wanting to tank or not spending the time to gear up and tank - and if they don't want to gear up at all then they probably don't want to tank anyway or maybe don't want to spend the time learning it.<br />
<br />
I still think the new Dungeon System will help with this through the faster turnover rate and random heroic feature, but overall we can't force people to play something they don't want to play so there will likely always be a shortage of tanks or healers to some degree. You should try playing one those, it is pretty amusing when finding dps is your biggest issue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21035178040-how-to-solve-the-tank-shortage.html))<br />
<br />
Cataclysm gear stats<br />
Unless I'm mistaken, the Cata gear stats will break down like this:<br />
Melee: Hit, Crit, Haste, Expertise, Mastery<br />
Ranged: Hit, Crit, Haste, Mastery<br />
Caster: Hit, Crit, Haste, Mastery<br />
Healer: Spirit, Crit, Haste, Mastery <br />
<br />
You are not mistaken. Everyone also gets stamina, armor, and their primary stat (Str, Int or Agi). Resilience and Spell Pen will continue to be PvP stats. This is not set in stone either. Cataclysm isn't finished. <br />
<br />
Tanks will also have block (but not block value), dodge, parry and perhaps armor. It isn't super important how many stats everyone has. Melee for example need hit and expertise, but casters need more hit. It only gets to be a problem if for example you can't piece together a set that has all the stats you need in the amounts you want. Many tanks for example will happily sacrifice hit and expertise for more armor and stamina. <br />
<br />
So, I'm guessing the current plan is to get rid of the Spirit &gt; Other Stat talents completely? <br />
It's too early to tell. It would be nice to get rid of them for say mages and warlocks given that their gear generally won't have Spirit. We can't get rid of conversion talents completely. For example, Enhancement and Retribution will need some way to derive spell power from attack power and need a way to get mana back without Int or Spirit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21042558325-give-caster-dps-a-4th-stat-in-cataclysm.html))<br />
<br />
Talents Reset<br />
Refunding talents generally isn't something we do as a courtesy. Meaning, if we had our way, we would never refund talents. We only do it when the data would get seriously jacked up by not doing so. For example, you may still have points in a talent that no longer exists or something similar.<br />
<br />
As to why we don't like to refund talents, part of it is avoiding the expectation that regular talent refunds are something that happens often. Another part is that while it may be exciting for very active players to get a talent refund, it can actually be a major bummer for the alt you play seldomly or even the player who only logs on every few weeks. Now you feel like you have to do a lot of research and action bar management before you can even jump in and start playing again.<br />
<br />
It's quite likely everyone will get a talent refund when the Cataclysm data changes go in (which if history holds, will actually occur before the Cataclysm box is available at retail). I wouldn't expect any before then. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20860805400-shamans-getting-talent-reset.html))<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft vs. Starcraft 2<br />
Couple of things....<br />
<br />
SC2 is being developed from day one as a multiplayer and single-player game. WoW added Battlegrounds and later Arenas after it had already shipped. That's a little bit about what Rob is talking about -- the difficulty we have had retrofitting WoW's PvP. I don't want to put words in his mouth, but I don't think he is saying Arenas were a mistake. It's the way we introduced Arenas that has continued to cause ourselves a lot of work and occasionally caused frustration for players. We like the Arena gameplay though or we would have cut it or overhauled it long ago. We do think we have shifted the PvP attention a little too much towards Arenas and away from BGs, and yes we understand that loot rewards are a big part of the reason why. We aim to fix this with Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Starcraft is also just a fundamentally different game. You aren't taking your campaign character into competitive multiplayer. In fact, there is no multiplayer character per se in the sense that you can grant your character more power over time. You start every map with the same base and units as everyone else. Starcraft also isn't going to change over time except for whatever balance or design changes the team makes. There is no equivalent to the new gear or whatever that suddenly shifts the balance of power.<br />
<br />
We make PvP-specific rules when we think it's appropriate. Resilience and diminishing returns are two obvious examples. SC2 does the same thing. Not everything works completely differently between the two halves of the game though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21038227946-how-come-wow-development-isnt-like-sc-2s.html))<br />
<br />
Tank Balance<br />
On Sartharion +3, cutting-edge guilds who normally tank with a warrior would (perhaps somewhat begrudgingly) use a DK to tank instead because the benefit was so massive. The same thing happened on Vezax where good guilds replaced their warrior tanks with DKs. Death knights were overpowered at the time.<br />
<br />
We are not seeing the kind of massive swapping one class of tank for another in ToC or the preliminary Icecrown testing. It's just not happening. If paladins or druids are too good or warriors or death knights aren't good enough, we're just not seeing them getting used for those fights to anywhere near the extent that DKs replaced other tanks on the encounters mentioned above.<br />
<br />
As just one example (and I wouldn't put too much weight behind this), the number of paladin tanks used to test Icecrown on the PTR has been almost imperceptibly low. It's possible there were actually none this weekend, or else the numbers were so small that we missed them. Sure these are not the hard mode encounters generally being tested, and you can come up with your own explanations for differences between how players might approach PTR and &quot;real&quot; raiding. But these are the kind of lopsided datasets we have to deal with when we're looking at who is using what tank and how that relates to success.<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about balancing around representation, as players often mistakenly claim. I am asking the question that I have asked before: if one or two of the tank classes have such a superior and unequivocal advantage in making a fight easier, why aren't more guilds using them, especially given the evidence that they have swapped tanks on previous encounters? I understand individuals of you may state it has happened to your guild. That's fine, but understand you are in a small minority. Overall, it's just not happening.<br />
<br />
One conclusion you can draw (though certainly not the only one) is that whatever differences in survivability there appear to be &quot;on paper,&quot; just don't make a significant difference in the actual fights, or at least not enough of a difference that guilds feel compelled to switch or are held back by not switching.<br />
<br />
As an aside: there are some specific fights where the specific mechanics lead guilds to tend to use one tank over another, say a druid to tank Thorim hard or a shield-using tank on adds for Anub hard. Most players aren't as concerned about these one-off encounters because it feels like such an encounter-specific problem and doesn't feel like anyone's job as guild main tank is in jeopardy. (Individuals of you may feel differently of course.)<br />
<br />
I know there are lot of threads on this topic right now. I avoided many of the ones that are doing a good job discussing numbers because I didn't want to derail them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/21042556798-if-blizzard-cant-even-get-tank-balance-right.html))<br />

If I remember correctly, you wont be able to do that since they are putting a gear score total (all gear worn and banked) requirements on heroics. I am sure a few crafted items will get you past that though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other than that I'm not super concerned about stat allocation in Cataclysm as long as it's balanced between class roles and armor classes. Like I hate it how it is now that plate has way more stamina on it than any other armor class, so not only are they getting the increased physical damage reduction, they can just straight up eat more damage. It's silly how even an averagely geared plate-wearer in a DPS spec will probably beat out nearly any other class in health by about 5-8k easily.</div></div><hr />

I imagine this is going to be pretty lenient. I wouldn't be surprised if a character who's just hit 80 will be eligible for placement in about 90% of heroics via the random dungeon tool. It's the kind of thing that's only in place to stop horrendously undergeared players from getting dropped into say, the Heroic Icecrown 5.<br />

<br />
The reason warrior tanks work so well in raids is due to the other things they can do. They are far and away the most mobile tanking class being able to very quickly move around as needed. They have very good aoe threat and yet again their aoe threat is mobile. Once a DK drops death and decay, good luck moving around for the next while. If they are a bit slow on a pack of adds, they can AoE taunt them until they build some aggro. They have more silences than any other tank, more stuns than any other tank, provide the best melee AP reduction debuff, the best raid health buff, stack the sunder debuff on the boss and if you are doing the farm runs no other tank can come close to the rate of pulls that a warrior can manage.<br />
<br />
Yes you can make a raid with all the same capabilities without a warrior MT but you pretty much have to build the raid around not having a warrior. The only weakness of the warrior is the relatively small number of cooldowns but with so many healer cooldowns available now that is a lot easier to manage. If the mitigation is similar, the cooldowns are close enough and the threat is similar then it makes a hell of a lot of sense to use the tank that can stack a ton of buffs and debuffs while also having the greatest mobility, most taunts, fastest pulls, most interrupts etc. etc. etc. The reason so many guilds use warrior MTs is nothing to do with their damage reduction which is so close to the other tanks that it makes no difference. It is because they are just simply better at everything else that you will want your tank to do.</div></div><hr />

Wait what? You trolling? Warriors AOE threat is actually among the weakest. Paladin tanks have a pseudo AOE taunt on a miniscule (in comparison) cooldown and a regular taunt on a regular cooldown - both can be used as direct taunts as well, which allows a Paladin tank to taunt at incredible rates at incredible distances. Warriors are slightly more mobile than Paladins or Death knights, granted - but their own toolsets mean that they rarely should ever need to move in the first place. Loose add? Death Grip it right into the slaughterzone, it 'taunts' too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Provide the best melee AP reduction debuff<br />
The talent improvements so expensive it'll have considerable impact on the warriors ability to manage threat. A Ret Paladin (or Prot Paladin) can keep up the improved version automatically, and at only 2 talent points which would have no impact on their DPS. Only limitation is that it can't always be applied immedietly on all targets in dense AOE situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
the best raid health buff<br />
The talent improvements required which no proper prot warrior will ever pick up. DPS Warriors will provide this, not prots.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes you can make a raid with all the same capabilities without a warrior MT but you pretty much have to build the raid around not having a warrior. fastest pulls, most interrupts<br />
Fastest pulls? Would that not imply a rich amount of ranged pulling abilities, possessed bly classes like Prot Paladins or DKs?</div></div><hr />

On the random dungeon thing: hope you can do this as group, else pugging with strangers will reward more than playing with friends!!! Something I can not, in no possible way, see as fitting a social game.<br />

<br />
Not the whole truth since you can have 2 of your friends online you form group of 3 ppl. So you need 2 pugs more to go random heroic you join the random dungeon thingy and get 2 new pugs and get fast in to the instance and get your rewards afterwards.

<br />
Although pretty sure the &quot;gearscore&quot; (Lol....) they made will place people of similar gear together, but not NOT let them que up together for a heroic. Therefore, you can still bring your best bud's ALT to the new ICC heroics while hes rocking all blues/greens. I have no problem with this as long as the person whos &quot;carring&quot; him has above average gear/skill. Like my brothers holy paladin with 35k mana and ToGC gear, he can do H ToC and carry someone in all greens. <br />
<br />
Gear doesn't always mean skill, I did 4k dps on my elemental shaman with greens/blues and DEADLY PvP gear in Vault. Although there are sometimes limitations. I'll be mass running Random Heroics all week long for the first week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I can read, you can redo the same heroic, even if you're saved to it, so long as you draw it from the Random PuG thing. They will all drop Triumph badges, and each time you complete a heroic, you get 2 more triumph badges.<br />
<br />
So, yes. Triumph will lose all it's value even faster than Conquest did.<br />
<br />
Call me elitist, but it still devalues all the effort I put it in to my main. Sure, for my it's definitely content &gt; gear (my guild is still pushing for that Algalon kill) but I thought good gear was supposed to be a reward for good work. I certainly thought it my reward to job well done, the icing on that cake of epic feeling when you down a hard boss.<br />

The &quot;shortage&quot; is caused by a lot of people not wanting to tank or not spending the time to gear up and tank - and if they don't want to gear up at all then they probably don't want to tank anyway or maybe don't want to spend the time learning it.<br />
<br />
Or maybe people feels that tankhas been left out to much, that they are considered less then other classes.<br />
<br />
Just on top of my head I can think of:<br />
No epic Quel'delar quest chain for tanks with the only excuse that they do not feel like it and tanks can get other weapons<br />
No real tanking enchant with +sta left out with the reason that tanks would find it good and actually use it. (think what rage there would have been if +spellpower was left out since every caster uses that..)<br />
No Kirin Tor tank ring, not even one of the upcoming upgrades ones in 3.3</div></div><hr />

I rerolled from Tank to Healer for this exact reason.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Collected</div><div class="date">2009-11-17, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So let's see...<br />
<br />
Tier 9 requires 210 Emblems of Triumph for the 5 piece set.<br />
<br />
Max emblems dropped from 5 man heroics is currently 5. It will be 7 post patch.<br />
<br />
So if you ran ramdom heroics all week and got lucky with the ones that drop 5 emblems (7 post patch) every time, it would take 30 heroics to get all 5 pieces of the Tier 9 set.<br />
<br />
This would be the quickest way to get the full set. You won't be that lucky tho, so it will probably take more like 40 runs or something but even still.. spread over a week or two that is easily do-able.<br />
<br />
And if we assume the wait time for these random groups will be virtually instant and with no waiting around for people to make their way to instance of filling that last spot, then it will make it so easy.<br />
<br />
What I am confused about however is how does the random system put together the groups? Does it assume every heroic requires 1 tank, 1 healer and 3 dps and group accordingly?<br />
<br />
Edit: Just realised my logic is a bit flawed as the first run of every day will drop 2 frost, not triumph.. so spread over a few days it will be more than 30. But you get the idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Apparently, yes.<br />
<br />
It's meant to be extremely smart.<br />
<br />
It is also meant to determine which classes you already have in your group, and which would be best suited to add to your group (for buffs, etc).<br />
<br />
I also remember them saying something that it doesn't only look at the class, it also looks at the talent spec of each player... so it won't put a shadow priest in your group as a healer.</div></div><hr />

Thanks to TOC5 regular, boe gear and reputation gear its really not that hard to gear up to run heroics at 80. Healers and dps really won't need to gear up at all. Tanks will end up gearing up however. My dk gear template has 29k health, defense cap, 21 dodge, 15 parry, 37 expertise (way to much but the items are simply to good not to use) and 4% hit (which is close to cap for heroic dungeons). Its all gear that is either obtainable before stepping foot in a heroic. I've been thinking about just skipping that whole step throwing on some dps gear and gearing up in heroics.</div></div><hr />

Really? Did you really think that emblems of triumph were ever hard to get? I don't know very many people that actually thought that. Also, shouldn't you be bitching about emblems of frost dropping in 10 man because that &quot;puts casuals on the same scale as us uber hardcores just because they can farm through 10 man which anyone can do&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, almost guaranteeing you a spot in a guild that you never have to fight for unless you suck is a bad thing amirite?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
[list] No epic Quel'delar quest chain for tanks with the only excuse that they do not feel like it and tanks can get other weapons<br />
<br />
<br />
Tanks already get spots in raids easier and your normal raid only has 2-3 tanks. Those 2-3 tanks gear faster than any other classes because of all the gear designed specifically for them. Most dps classes are competing with at least 8 other players. So, TANKS SHOULD GET GEAR FROM RAIDS!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No real tanking enchant with +sta left out with the reason that tanks would find it good and actually use it. (think what rage there would have been if +spellpower was left out since every caster uses that..)<br />
<br />
<br />
What the hell you mean there is no good tanking enchant? What the hell do you think blood draining and blade warding are? Oh, and the reason 40 stamina on a one handed weapon was left out had nothing to do with &quot;tanks [finding] it good&quot; and everything to do with it being overpowered as all hell in pvp. You were allowing a DW to add 80 stamina with this enchant.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No Kirin Tor tank ring, not even one of the upcoming upgrades ones in 3.3<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tanks have much easier access to much better rings and they don't have to spend 8-9k for the best one. Most people I know don't even go near the KoT ring unless its much better than anything else they have access to. This ring is a gold sink. Its not something you buy because you want to, its something you buy because its better than anything else you will ever get a hold of.<br />
<br />
The only real reason tanks have to bitch is the defense game. It gets old having to regem/enchant for defense at every upgrade. They are also the only ones that really have to pre-gear for an encounter in order to perform well in the encounter. A great deal of this will hopefully be addressed in Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not elitist. That's stupid. My fourth alt who has never ran a raid with my guild ever is already blowing Triumph emblems on crusader orbs to sell. Triumph emblems were never hard to get on the same level that Valor or Conquest were. It is currently possible to get 84 emblems of Triumph per week max, unless my math is off. Realistically, though, pugs aren't running TotGC 10/25 every week so we'll ignore those and call it 54. As opposed to 25 Valor when WotLK came out.(I'm ignoring Conquest because I don't feel like figuring out hard modes dropping extra, and Ulduar 10 hard modes dropping some) Adding on to the fact that TotC 10 and 25 is retardedly easier than Naxx or Maly 25 ever were when WotLK was released.(Sarth was still a joke and free Valor emblems, though)<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but your Triumph emblem bought gear means nothing now and never has. Triumph emblems were a joke to aquire since they were released and were meant to be. The entire point of patch 3.2 was to allow casual players to gear up to fight Arthas in 10 man regular Icecrown.(I personally can't wait for the people who can't kill any of the hard mode ICC bosses whining about how easy it is.)<br />
<br />
Also, other people doing something you can do three months after you did it in no way devaules anything, unless you have serious self esteem issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tier 9 requires 210 Emblems of Triumph for the 5 piece set.<br />
<br />
Max emblems dropped from 5 man heroics is currently 5. It will be 7 post patch.<br />
<br />
So if you ran ramdom heroics all week and got lucky with the ones that drop 5 emblems (7 post patch) every time, it would take 30 heroics to get all 5 pieces of the Tier 9 set.<br />
<br />
This would be the quickest way to get the full set. You won't be that lucky tho, so it will probably take more like 40 runs or something but even still.. spread over a week or two that is easily do-able.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You forgot Naxx 10/25, OS 10/25, Ony 10/25, TOGC 10/25, TOGC 10/25 and heroics will all drop badges. You can do all of those raids in a single day and have an entire T9 set.. (also rememberin that T9 drops in some of those raids anyway..)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You over simply things.. its not about gear, its about skill. I think many raiders get dissapointed that people who can't even clear TOC regular will be sporting ilvl 245 gear in a matter of days while those who did the raid thing may have spent literally weeks or months fighting over gear.<br />
<br />
Toc clears happen in an hour.. so i don't want to hear &quot;don't have time to raid&quot; either.. if you can clear a heroic you can clear toc 10/25 regular.<br />
<br />
having equal gear doesn't mean &quot;putting skill to test&quot;.. does equal gear mean you know the fight? know how to survive? can follow directions or lead groups? does it mean you know the most effective strategy? T9 gear doesn't make you more competitive that t8 or t8.5</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocac05adb153</div><div class="date">2009-11-17, 02:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So let's see...<br />

<br />
And if we assume the wait time for these random groups will be virtually instant and with no waiting around for people to make their way to instance of filling that last spot, then it will make it so easy.<br />
<br />
What I am confused about however is how does the random system put together the groups? Does it assume every heroic requires 1 tank, 1 healer and 3 dps and group accordingly?<br />
<br />
Edit: Just realised my logic is a bit flawed as the first run of every day will drop 2 frost, not triumph.. so spread over a few days it will be more than 30. But you get the idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice. So now i know what to do on Patchday and the following Days. Random Heroics. The Fact that i don´t have a raiding guild and that my Gear is a bit outdated makes me wanna do that. 30-40 Heroics sounds doable for the whole T9 Set. And then maybe a few other things like Trinkets and so on. <br />

The bottom line is that right now, WoW mechanics and definitely WoW culture reward gear far more than it rewards skill.

As it should be.<br />
<br />
If one were to take 3.3 and it was a standalone, static game, and one said &quot;the game is balanced around ilevel 232-245 items&quot;, then you'd have a balance point everyone could reach within days of hitting 80, and still have room above 245 for people with the means and the ambition to let them *outperform* the balance.<br />
<br />
I'll be very blunt -- WoW is screwed 8 ways to the left if nothing can be done to fix the mindset in the player base that only people with 245-258 should be allowed to pug frickin' Naxx or Ulduar. The way you fix that is by creating a baseline of gear that everyone can reach and reach quickly for that patch's content, and consider anything you can gear above that a value-add, not the minimum to get in.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miri</div><div class="date">2009-11-17, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tank Shortage<br />
The &quot;shortage&quot; is caused by a lot of people not wanting to tank or not spending the time to gear up and tank - and if they don't want to gear up at all then they probably don't want to tank anyway or maybe don't want to spend the time learning it.<br />
<br />
I still think the new Dungeon System will help with this through the faster turnover rate and random heroic feature, but overall we can't force people to play something they don't want to play so there will likely always be a shortage of tanks or healers to some degree. You should try playing one those, it is pretty amusing when finding dps is your biggest issue. (Source)<br />
<br />
I know someone who wouldn't even tank until they had a full set of epics to work with. Never mind that they had never actually specc'd Prot to see if they would even be a decent tank while leveling (or even at 80). They picked up all the tanking gear they could get (all epic), and then one day was like &quot;I think I can tank now!&quot; They never learned how to tank, just that they got &quot;uber&quot; gear and that was that. Really glad I never had to be witness to the tanking they do (transferred before they got all their &quot;epix&quot;).<br />
<br />
I went back to tanking now to get some upgrades so people won't look at my health and kick me from a group. Tanking was always my offspec, even when raiding, but since I was the only Paladin healer in the raids, my role was already defined for me. So I picked up the leftovers in heroics and in our raids and built my tanking set. My GM at the time was nice enough to go holy (or ret) and let me tank heroics for the guild to get a feel for tanking. Their test for me was putting the 3 best DPS into my group and telling me to have at it. Best (and steepest) learning curve ever for me. It worked out really well then and coming back to playing the character on a full time basis has been continuing to go well. My husband and I modify our roles based on who's in LFG when we are ready to do our heroics. If there's a tank, I go holy and heal the run while my husband DPSs. If there's a healer, I'll stay Prot and he'll DPS. If it's just a stack of DPS, well, I tank and he heals. It's been working out well, but I'll say that my server seems to have a greater healer shortage than they do a tank shortage. We have tanks (with great gear) BEGGING to get into raids, but every raid is always looking for healers.</div></div><hr />

Ditto! I stopped collecting gear when I quit raiding--I've been leveling my alts, and haven't been able to find a raid guild that suited my time schedule (prefer weekends). Recently I looked at my gear and got all /sadpanda (even tho it was pretty damn decent for off spec during the T7/7.5 days, and my main spec was almost all BiS at the time), so I've started running heroics again. Once the patch hits I'll be chaining heroics non stop so I can get gear upgrades and (I guess) be ready for the gear reset of Cata (since I doubt anyone will be PUGging Ulduar/TotC on my realm when ICC hits).</div></div><hr />

The &quot;as it should be&quot; is only a personal opinion. Its been discussed here a jillion times as well ;) I don't like this notion since it means wow is nothing than a glorified dance class where you learn choreography rather then play a unique class with unique skills and have to balance those skills according to different gear levels. Now its one big army marching in and the only thing that matters is who is going to throw down a fish feast.<br />

Gear doesn't let you outperform anything. You can surely &quot;outgear&quot; something and make it ez-mode but does that makethe game more fun? i personally don't think so :)<br />

The weekly raid fixes that. Baddies will still be baddies and still fail naxx 10/25 even sporting ilvl 245 gear. The sad part is most of those baddies probably won't even beat a TOC to get a trphy for real tier gear so it solves nothing but making people &quot;Feel good&quot; <br />
<br />
Wow raid gear has always been cassified as tiers.. i know people will sport t9 in the first day after patch day running all raids and such.. i'll deck out both of my specs and be done with it. I'm not complaining but it just feels like there is no challenge moving forward unless they make ICC incredibly stupidly hard and long. What happens when all these scrubs have ilvl 232/245 gear and they're standing around in dalaran doing nothing? Are they gonna l2play and actually try hardmodes? are they going to deal with 2-300gold a day repair bills for pugging the weekly raids with fail groups? (hopefully not pugging naxx ezmode all the time defeating the purpose of having a raid weekly)</div></div><hr />

I love the new LFG system, I think its a great idea and does help with the shortage of certain aspects of the 5 man team.<br />
BUT, Is anyone else as upset as me that they are dumbing down the entire game and taking away the aspects that make each class individual? That is something they said they wouldn't do, but look at the first post, every class will have the same stats, except tanks have expertise and healers don't have hit. Come on guys.... Do you know how many people this is gonna drive away? I know ive personally said, that ill stick with it for a little while and see but half of my friends have already said they are leaving. I know eventually they are gonna dump us off anyway for their new MMO but i don't think the players are gonna transistion to the new one like Blizzard thinks.

<br />
Well what difference does it make if they're stood around Dalaran in 232 gear or stood around Dalaran in blues? It makes no difference other than giving that player more options in PvE and allowing them more potential enjoyment of more content.<br />
<br />
The challenge moving forward for raiders is ICC, just like the challenge moving forward was Ulduar. Nothing lasts forever. After 6 months or whatever, the bleeding edge end game content is all cleared, and that should be the time that more casual players get to enjoy the content while the raiders move forward.</div></div><hr />

I love the new LFG system, I think its a great idea and does help with the shortage of certain aspects of the 5 man team.<br />
BUT, Is anyone else as upset as me that they are dumbing down the entire game and taking away the aspects that make each class individual? <br />
<br />
<br />
With all due respect, the &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; way of thinking is nothing new. The developers have been talking about this approach for a long time now. Yes they're making things easier and yes they're opening up more content to the more casual playerbase but so what? If it means those players get more enjoyment out of the game then it's a win-win situation as far as I'm concerned. I don't see a mass group of players leaving, the opposite infact, I see a lot of excited people extremely buzzed about this patch.</div></div><hr />

Been playing for almost 5 years, and I haven't had this much fun since uhh... Twin Emps! Which is a long time ago!<br />
<br />
Triumph changes are excellent, while I can't make raids I can easily do 20 heroics/day with my friends, just steamroll each one in 20 mins and ka-ching, bajillion triumphs! Can't wait!<br />
<br />
As a Paladin Tank I do understand the 'no tanking weapon' decision, and I'm not too worried about it. It's hardly an upgrade for us when we get one, and I can pull a lot of threat through abilities anyway... they just look better cosmetically for us ;D<br />
<br />

It makes no difference other than giving that player more options in PvE and allowing them more potential enjoyment of more content.<br />
<br />
If there is no challenge other than getting free gear (yes heroics are free gear) then what is the point? that is the point i'm making.. are these people going to start raiding or are they going to say they dont' have the free time yet they can stand in dalaran and bs in /2 all the time?<br />
<br />
Whats more enjoyable about having a certain gear lvl that isn't required for anything you chose not to do? people who didn't do ulduar or toc aren't going to automagically do ICC and people who power grinded heroics for tier 8 didn't start doing well in any other instances either.. (still failed..) just not sure what its fixing. I understand &quot;parity&quot; and &quot;see content&quot; but i'm under the impression gear parity isnt fixing the issues at hand<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The challenge moving forward for raiders is ICC, just like the challenge moving forward was Ulduar. Nothing lasts forever. After 6 months or whatever, the bleeding edge end game content is all cleared, and that should be the time that more casual players get to enjoy the content while the raiders move forward.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus ulduar was very short lived, hard modes barely achieved by anyone and most pugs STILL fail ulduar which is what i don't get about the point you're trying to make. Are you saying now that t9 will be the standard pugs will be better? content will be more fun? people will automatically learn fights? does T9 come with DBM and automatically move you out of fire? under a mushroom? dps the right boss so they don't reset? learn to heal right targets? Not sure where you're going here.<br />
<br />
t9 is casual.. it only takes 30 mins to clear toc 10 ten man and maybe 45 mins to clear toc 25 and then it only takes about an hour to clear togc 10 and.. sure anub 25 is a cockblock but for most people anub 25 isn't a gear check (it is for tanks and healers and other classes) as much as it is &quot;Can you do the dance&quot; check. which has no bearing on the person having t9 gear but mostly know where they're running and w well timed BoP</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2009-11-17, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The weekly raid fixes that. Baddies will still be baddies and still fail naxx 10/25 even sporting ilvl 245 gear. The sad part is most of those baddies probably won't even beat a TOC to get a trphy for real tier gear so it solves nothing but making people &quot;Feel good&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You make it sound like getting trophies is easy... I've run ToC 25 most weeks and still don't have one. I snagged a T-9.25 piece from Koralon, but still haven't managed to win a damned trophy roll. Assuming you're not doing HM content (which most of us aren't), a 25 man raid gets no more than 6 trophies a week, which means that on average that raid gets 1 trophy for every person every 4 weeks (minus one unlucky guy who has to wait till the fifth week). Patch 3.2 has been out for about 3 months, so a theoretical raid with a perfectly fair disruption system and the same 25 people running has, at most, 3 trophies per member. It's actually somewhere between 2 and 3, since the first five weeks of the patch only had a limited number of bosses. <br />
<br />
Since most of us don't run with the same 25 people every time, and don't have a perfectly fair distribution system, it's unlikely that most people even have two trophies even if they clear every week. I personally PuG 25 man content (my guild isn't big enough, we run 10 mans), and since my PuGs don't always completely clear (sadly, they're PuGs), I sometimes join them in progress (meaning I don't get the early boss(es)), and my RNG luck has sucked (meh), I still don't have any.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HavocLock</div><div class="date">2009-11-17, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You over simply things.. its not about gear, its about skill. I think many raiders get dissapointed that people who can't even clear TOC regular will be sporting ilvl 245 gear in a matter of days while those who did the raid thing may have spent literally weeks or months fighting over gear.<br />
<br />
Toc clears happen in an hour.. so i don't want to hear &quot;don't have time to raid&quot; either.. if you can clear a heroic you can clear toc 10/25 regular.<br />
<br />
having equal gear doesn't mean &quot;putting skill to test&quot;.. does equal gear mean you know the fight? know how to survive? can follow directions or lead groups? does it mean you know the most effective strategy? T9 gear doesn't make you more competitive that t8 or t8.5<br />
<br />
<br />
dude... thats my point exactly. Gear doesnt equal skill and if people need unique gear to be more confident in their skill then they are doing it wrong. If you notice Blizz is rewarding those accomplishing the latest and greatest with titles and mounts... which cannot be bought with badges. That is your reward. Gear gap was an issue for a long time and led to the elitism many have expressed in the preceeding pages. The same goes for pvp and I have a feeling that rated BGs will do for pvp gear what badges have done for pve. If this game is about skill stop letting the gear do the talking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This supports my argument even more. TOC 25 is a joke.. its not hard AT ALL even with tier 8 gear and absolutely no t9 pieces its a cake-walk in 25 if people know the fights. Gear isn't going to change the success rate.<br />
<br />
After 3.3 if your 10 man guild still can't do togc 10 man then i suggest you find a new guild :) thats sort of my point. The gear isn't going to fixs the problems with the players who don't bother to learn the figths or find a guild that will help them. TOC is a 1 hour event.. its not like a 3-4 day raid lock that ulduar is, its 1 hour in a big room staying out of fire, shooting the right target, changing to the right color and knowing how to pvp bit and then running into an ice patch. <br />
<br />
SO run 10 man togc and get the trophies for clears with 25 tries (very easily doable if everyone is geared) and share the trophies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So now its about vanity pets and vanity titles rather than vanity gear? does that really change anything at all? not really.. infact the gear aspect is better since better gear means people are playing the game.. what happens when people get an achievement or a mount? they're done as far as they are concerned.<br />
<br />
There was a concept of progression that you had to take your guild through the raid tiers to accomplish something. I think i miss that and its sort of sad its about watching videos on youtube and completing a well done dance rather then running your friends through some epic trials and tribulations to well deserved rewards. <br />
<br />
now lvl 80s run into togc get geared up and then overgear naxx for achievements and quit cuz they're bored standing around in dalaran or they end up farming for vanity items (pets/mounts/titles) which really is just something that puts more money in blizz's pockets rather then adding value to the game.</div></div><hr />

i think they proposed having no armor value with the exception of tanks if that is what you're asking. I think they will still have armor types (mail, learther.. so on and so forth) - they would kill 50% of wow's profs if they dropped armor types.</div></div><hr />

Those 2-3 tanks gear faster than any other classes because of all the gear designed specifically for them.<br />
Tanks (at least decent ones) get raid spots easier because there are so few tanks around (as well as healers). If not every paladin, druid, dk and their mothers and sisters had to flex their epeens on damage meters, but would actually take the challenge and tank (or heal), the situation would look very differently.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most dps classes are competing with at least 8 other players.<br />
This argument was brought up often enough in discussions like this one, but it just isn't true. Show me one single dps class/spec that has to compete with so many other raid members over a piece of gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, TANKS SHOULD GET GEAR FROM RAIDS!<br />
And how would it affect you in any way if tanks could get a weapon from the Quel'delar questline like everyone else??<br />
<br />
<br />
Tanks have much easier access to much better rings and they don't have to spend 8-9k for the best one. Most people I know don't even go near the KoT ring unless its much better than anything else they have access to. This ring is a gold sink. Its not something you buy because you want to, its something you buy because its better than anything else you will ever get a hold of.<br />
Well, since there is no tanking ring available, tanks have no choice other than getting rings from other sources. And if there WAS a tanking ring, I'm sure many tanks would buy it. Your statement doesn't make much sense...<br />
<br />
<br />
They [tanks] are also the only ones that really have to pre-gear for an encounter in order to perform well in the encounter.<br />
So what exactly did you say about tanks being able to get gear from other sources than those encounters they want to do? Oh, I remember. <br />
TANKS SHOULD GET GEAR FROM RAIDS!</div></div><hr />

Look, most all raids run by competent guilds were on farm prior to the following content patch or expansion. If people are bored they can go for the achievements which some guilds will never have the skill to complete. If they just want to stand around Dal sporting their title its their perogative. Boredom has nothing to do with newer people getting gear and having a chance to see (and if their raids skill allows, defeat) the latest raid.<br />

<br />
All games are a game of scripted plays.. even basketball you have your scenarios that are coached into you as instinct. Its not necessarily the &quot;Scriptiness&quot; of the game i have issue with but the fact there is no more linearity into achieving something.<br />
<br />
As far as boredom, would people really be able to say they're bored if the raiding was a bit harder? i wouldn't care so much if t9 was abundant in 3.3 if the raids were actually hard.. hardmode anub is tough, yes.. some ulduar hardmodes are tough, yes, but are the people farming heroics for gear going to attempt those and raise the general populations awareness and skill level and increase the odds of people seeing more end game content and harder fights? not at all.. in fact i think it dumbs people down even more because they miss the progression of boss fights and how things have changed - they compltely lack the understanding of raid/group composition and fail at pulling things together - processes that have little to do with your tier of gear and shiny purples but actually trying to play the game.<br />
<br />
If you can farm for achievements you most certainly can raid and i guess thats where the confusion about this comes into play - so many people say they don't have time/patience to raid but they can do dailies for 8 hours a day to get rep to buy a fishing pole to get salty achievement? that like 100 hours of work there.. 10 times the effort of getting into ulduar and getting some gear. Thats 100 tries on anub heroic 25!<br />
<br />
i personally didn't understand the complaints about tier gear from 7 to 8.. i too was thinking it was cool to get the gear but as soon as toc hit and i did the raids and realized how easy they were i was blown away they're just going to hand out the gear and hope for best in 3.3. again, i wont' complain. i'll have 2.9k gear score for my offspec and mainspec the first day 3.3 is stable and live on my server</div></div><hr />

Im playing warrior as my main char, really dont mind tanking, but one talent spec is pve dps, other pvp dps... No space left for prot :P<br />
<br />
<br />
That's the main reason I hear from classes who can tank but don't.<br />
<br />
The other reason is that tanking certain fights is endlessly boring and mindnumbing. Sure, tanking Patch the first time is awesome and impressive - but after a few times, it's one big yawn. I remember at the start of LK, we did Naxx and it was getting late. On Kel our MT died because of red circle - he'd actually fallen asleep on his keyboard. So I pick Kel up and the adds - then suddenly shot awake because of some yells and I had died of the same circle because I too couldn't keep awake. Ulduar at first was sexy and exciting, but again after awhile it's only a matter of mumbling 'taunt plox' and that's your job done. I only tanked TOC once, and now quit tanking because of certain medical issues with my muscles caused by the same repeated motion required to tank.<br />
<br />
No matter how tired I am, I never actually manage to fall asleep on my dps or healing toon.<br />
<br />
<br />
The other reason tanks are so few, is because pugs are so HARSH. OHNOES you don't have 50k hp unbuffed! KICKPLOX. When I was gearing my druid I REFUSED to run Pugs with anyone other than my friends. I HATED tanking for pugs even when I was properly geared because whenever something goes wrong, it is *always* the tank's fault. Nevermind that you can soulshatter when Noth blinks, it's my fault that you got aggro. Sure.<br />
<br />
This attitude is sickening, it killed a lot of my fun. I am a pretty decent tank, last time I checked, certainly enjoyed it especially on fights where I could feel a bit like a hybrid (running around rebirthing here, kitty'ing there, back to bear to pick up those random adds, etc), but it was unrewarding, because of the attitude you get from idiots in pugs. And, there was no gear for druids (Ulduar10, I don't run 25s on my druid), no enchants, I hear there's still no weapon for ferals other than the Naxx25 staff (again, I don't tank anymore), no proper gems until way too late into LK. Tanks are forgotten, and especially druid tanks.<br />
<br />
As for not pugging as a tank - I did do hardcore raiding, but that was as a warlock. Then again, I hardly assume tank shortage is an issue for proper guilds, it's pugs that lack them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps should have phrased it better, yes. It 'taunts' in the essense that the target is forced to attack the DK (though yes threat is unmodified) - often long enough so that the DKs threat generation should be sufficient to overtake proper aggro over whatever had it before which in the context of the post, was pack pulling. Obviously that isn't true though if its beeing directly nuked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Or maybe people feels that tankhas been left out to much, that they are considered less then other classes.<br />
Yes, almost guaranteeing you a spot in a guild that you never have to fight for unless you suck is a bad thing amirite?<br />
Well I do not mind that at all. Altough with my awesome skills some competition is not a problem ;-)<br />
But that is just not enough for people to roll Tank, as there is a shortage. And with the following short ontop-of-the-head examples I had I really think Tanks are left out a bit in this game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No epic Quel'delar quest chain for tanks with the only excuse that they do not feel like it and tanks can get other weapons<br />
&quot;Tanks has it easy so&quot;, TANKS SHOULD GET GEAR FROM RAIDS!<br />
In 25'man there might be a problem, but in 10man considering that gear still are somewhat class depending you are not rolling against that many more people. In 10man you have 2 tanks and 2 healers, leaving 6 slots for dps. split it in half and you got 3 mana classes left. That is one more person then the tank has to roll against. But 25man then? Well also take in consideration that instances drop way more dps gear then tank gear to even that out. So in the end it's fairly even. So no, tanks should have the cool and rewarding questline to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
About tanking enchants and Blood warding<br />
Ah, yes. I'm a bit outdated. Those was added very late in Wotlk and I still feel them to be fairly week enchants for tanking considering how much a dps or healers enchant contributes. There are alot of tanks using older, lvl 70, since they feel that they are contributing better. And yes, it's the reason acordingly do Ghostcrawler ( http://worldofraids.com/wow-blue-tracker/us-forums/14318707674-enchant-weapon-titanguard-removed.html ), first result on google search &quot;Titanguard Blue&quot;. And in respons to Pvp: They could for example had made it Unique so it doesn't affect PvP to much? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No Kirin Tor tank ring, not even one of the upcoming upgrades ones in 3.3<br />
Tanks have much easier access to much better rings and they don't have to spend 8-9k for the best one. Most people I know don't even go near the KoT ring unless its much better than anything else they have access to. This ring is a gold sink. Its not something you buy because you want to, its something you buy because its better than anything else you will ever get a hold of.<br />
First of all that logic is flawed. Why only leave out tanks? Why not skip the rings completely? Secondly tanks and others have about the same access to good rings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only real reason tanks have to bitch is the defense game. It gets old having to regem/enchant for defense at every upgrade. They are also the only ones that really have to pre-gear for an encounter in order to perform well in the encounter. A great deal of this will hopefully be addressed in Cataclysm.<br />
As a endgame raiding Paladin i do not feel the defense is so hard to manage. Yes, you have to regem sometimes with alot of new gear but still dps needs that to with hit so I think it's not a tank only &quot;problem&quot;. Pre-gearing is not a problem nowdays. At 60 there was more to do but at 80 only thing you have to gear up for is Hodir but you can just craft the Frost resist gear and gem it with some defense (or sta, depending on gear. My gear was fairly weak defense wise when I started Ulduar).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, you've got a point here, didn't think of rings and neck, which can be used by any class regardless of armor limitations. But I said &quot;dps class/spec&quot;, and in most cases it should be obvious whether a piece should go to healers or dps, so that divides those you listed roughly in half.<br />

So yes, there isn't anything wrong with my reading comprehension. The problem is that some of your &quot;facts&quot; (which i emboldened) were wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
druid can do better, but a warrior can do fine aoe threat as long as they know how to play (which sadly is the reason alot of warrior tanks suck)<br />
<br />
and a prot warrior doesnt have to beat the feral druid tanks aoe threat either, just the dps and healers threat, which is very easily achievable.</div></div><hr />

For instance, my main is a druid, mostly heals but I dps or tank here or there. All 3 sets are pretty solid. Now, I normally do heroic daily with my roommate and other buddy, which means right off the top that's 2 ULD25/ToC geared tanks off the board.<br />
<br />
I'm feeling bored, people are annoyingly spamming /2 for a tank for the daily, I log into my DK to tank for them and let them know to go easy on me since they are BiS and I'm in a Naxx 10 set and then they get made when they pull agro 2 seconds into a pull. <br />

Blame society for people thinking racism is material for jokes. Just look at basically any comedian that we, as society, as a whole, embrace. Look at any comedy show on television. All of this junk is filled with jokes based on racism and prejudices. I'm not saying its right but can you really blame someone for thinking a joke based on racism is acceptable? That person probably doesn't believe the prejudices within the joke and American culture is telling them that its ok to joke about other races/ethnic groups/religious groups.</div></div><hr />
