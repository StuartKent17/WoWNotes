Raid Loot Downgrading<br />
1. This shouldn't happen any longer, so going forward, the items downgrading themselves should be fixed. If you see it happen in a fresh circumstance, please let us know immediately.<br />
<br />
2. For those that have had mythic items downgrade themselves, please open a petition with the exact item name.<br />
<br />
Our ticket volume is a bit larger than normal, so it may take a little while to get to all requests, but we will work through these as quickly as possible. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14881728786?page=2#36))<br />

Thok Dropping Higher Quality Gear Than Intended<br />

Secondary Stat Attunements as a &quot;Guideline not a rule&quot; is not what I expected. Is the goal for the design not to make this work<br />
For some specs, especially tanks and healers, different stats are situationally more or less valuable. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/521833727370858496))<br />
Attunements being a guideline, not a rule, is the intended design. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/521833865443168258))<br />
what about specs where the attuned stat is your worst in 90% of situations?<br />
That's not ideal, and we hope to improve upon them in the future. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/521850963376615424))<br />
<br />
Is there any way we can get DoT tooltips on targets to update dynamically to reflect the changes to snapshotting?<br />
It's an issue that we're aware of, but is quite a big undertaking. Working on it for the future. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/521847972904980480))<br />

Free Character Migrations (FCM) 17/10<br />
The following Free Character Migrations are scheduled to be available until 23 October, 2014. They are all open for both factions:<br />
<br />
PvE Realms<br />
Draenor -&gt; Emerald Dream, Shadowsong<br />
Silvermoon -&gt; Azjol-Nerub, Khadgar<br />
<br />
PvP Realms<br />
Kazzak / Stormscale / Ragnaros / Twisting Nether -&gt; Darksorrow, Auchindoun<br />
<br />
RP Realms<br />
Argent Dawn -&gt; Moonglade, Darkmoon Faire<br />
<br />
If you wish to discuss an FCM for a specific realm, the dedicated discussion threads are linked above.<br />
<br />
Please note that FCMs are opened based on realm population tracking and analysis, not by request. If you’re looking for a specific migration (from realm A to realm B), you should in most cases use the Character Transfer service. Although we will try to avoid doing so without giving notice in advance, these FCMs may be closed before the scheduled date.<br />
<br />
Character Transfers (CT)<br />
All realms follow the regular CT rules, found here (http://eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_GB&amp;articleId=20416).<br />
<br />
Guild Transfers<br />
Although Free Guild Master Realm Transfers are not possible at this time, the Free Character Migration will allow you to retain your guild membership and reputation, provided that the guild master completes a Guild Master Realm Transfer first and the faction remains the same as that of the source realm.<br />

Nope. I can't find the changes to shadow either(you know, these where shadows should be able to do MORE while moving...and not less like it is now). <br />
<br />
Pretty much looks like some really big buffs and nerfs there(and at least shadow is not on the nerf list yet)....I think tomorrow there will be a lot of tears in the forum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The buff to pet damage (through increased inherited AP) should help with that. Whether it's enough will have to be seen. But, it's worth it to keep in mind that balance at 90 is less important than balance at 100. Quite a few &quot;draenor perks&quot; are incoming as you level up that will help hunter damage as well. <br />
<br />
Speaking as someone who mains a BM hunter... believe me, I'm very invested...</div></div><hr />

Too busy nerfing Demonology Warlocks back below Holy Priests.<br />
<br />
Over-reactions and wild swings like this is what happens when 'out-of-touch' meets 'incompetence' meets 'panic.' If you're nerfing/buffing classes and individual specs by 30% or more multiple times in a single month, it's safe to say that the business end of your crack pipe is probably hot to the touch.<br />
<br />
Here's how it's gone in the last four weeks for Demonology Warlocks:<br />
<br />
Step 1: Nerf Demo by 30% because your internal tools are broken and in the process make it clear that not a single person on your team plays a Demonology Warlock. Demo is now performing below holy priests. Tell people they're wrong and tweet &quot;I'm not seeing it&quot; and &quot;lol no&quot; when they point it out. Act like a smug, glib, dismissive little dickhead any time somebody comes to you with any evidence of your screw-up.<br />
<br />
Step 2: After a few thousand tweeter messages you realize your mistake and revert the 30% nerf. Demo is now back in the upper-middle of the pack at 100. Unfortunately, Demo is performing too well at 90. Even though 90 is only for a couple more weeks, you decide something must be done! <br />
<br />
Step 3: Even though level 90 damage is irrelevant and you've made the point that nothing is tuned for 90, you decide to return almost all of the previously reverted 30% nerf that put us below holy priests. Demonology is now back in the toilet at 100.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I, too, am displeased with my gnome. Seriously, with Blizzard it's either too far one direction or too far the other direction. Look, the smile was creepy and fake and holy moly those eyes. All that was needed was to make the eyes more in line with what was done for other female race models - except worgen; alas, the female worgen - and make that creepy smile more relaxed and natural.<br />
<br />
But now they all look perpetually tired and grumpy, like they woke up on the wrong side of the bed and stepped on bag of dog turd on their way out the front door that morning.<br />

After 10 years, and with the fifth expansion, there's some legit point to wonder why there isn't more efficiency. After all, the company has a wealth of experience under it's belt when it comes to expansion releases. I cannot think of any professional field that would be forgiving if there wasn't a tremendous improvement of automatism noticeable with such a long time of experience at hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not really over reacting. some folks are just a bit sensitive to paying a company to beta test. clearly there was no internal testing done. and by clearly i mean any testing at all of the leveling, soloing old content, doing current content, including the blasted lands quest line, would have shown that there were significant problems. <br />
<br />
the blasted lands questline was broken ... how does that happen? how is it that your pre-expac event is broken at launch? There is no excuse for it.<br />

Further more, flat across the board 20% buffs or nerfs isn't tuning. Let's get that straight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a difference between erratic buffs/nerfs and fine tuning.<br />
I'd expect some tuning phase. But that would be more like 1 - 3% here and there. A few numbers adjusted, a second added or shortened. Stuff like that.<br />
And with the experience they have, one would think they've got the tools to make this work.</div></div><hr />

It's not tuning when some specs have seen multiple 30%+ swings in the last month. Tuning, by definition, is little tweaks, here and there to bring the classes in line. It isn't nerfing a spec by 30%, 15 days later buffing it by 35%, and then nerfing it by 28% 15 days after that.<br />
<br />
Time for these devs to pull their heads out of their (broken) simcrafts and actually play the game a bit. It's like everything in the expansion was built and tuned around their external sim tools, the devs are out of touch with what's really going on in the game and shit hit the fan when things went live. Now they're seeing numbers that don't jive with their tools, so they're panicking and over-reacting.<br />
<br />
These simcraft tools that Celestalon and his team seem to value above all else, even more so than demonstrable effects and verifiable data from their PTR/Beta/Live servers, are wildly out-of-touch with reality.</div></div><hr />

It's for 1000 candys right now. During the event you can get like 500...and they get deleted after the event. So it's not looking like meant for this year.</div></div><hr />

This isn't release. This is pre patch. They do this every expansion. Why should anyone give a shit how much damage or healing they're doing at level 90 if at 100 it entirely shifts toward a more tuned, balanced, and fun experience? <br />
<br />
WoD hits in like 3 and a half weeks yet everyone's losing their heads already.<br />
<br />
I don't know what's with this community this expansion but no only did everyone overhype everything, they apparently completely forgot how Pre Expansion/Pre Patch works with an upcoming expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That being said, as a Fire Mage so far I seem to be roughly in the same place I was during MoP, every now and then I'd hit the top of the meter (kinda indicative of the groups I run with), but generally in the middle of the pack. I hate that they look at the top 5 or 10 players in the world and decide because these guys are doing so well, they have to kill the class. Hell, nobody, bit nobody was playing Fire the last two thirds of MoP (PvE raiding) and now I see some getting interested. No more, I'm going to have to listen to a whole crap-pot of &quot;you need to respec or play another class&quot; for WoD. Wonderful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realize that at the time of this posting the changes to your mage are NOT live yet right? I am guessing you don't. It's amazing what reading words on the internet does to one's perception of what they see. Server restarts are needed to implement the changes, so your mage has not been nerfed yet.<br />

http://www.warcraftlogs.com/statistics/5/ &lt;----Evidence as to why fury, fire and demo were nerfed. I'm not sure about demo or fire, but for fury it amounts to roughly a 5% nerf to our overall dps when simmed.</div></div><hr />

You notice that the candys are event-only? That means they get deleted after the event. You can not use them next year. Either Blizz screwed up or they just don't want anyone to get the costume this year(no idea why they did put it on there then) and gonna decrease the price next year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This might probably quite accurate. I am sure that most of the numbers balancing comes from being alot closer in touch with the pve community, thus they try to get those numbers to add up so they have the dps specs closer together in all the simcraft stuff, while for alot of the mechanical things they are probably taking a better look at what this would mean in a pvp scenario. <br />
<br />
And as an addition about being out of touch with their community and customers... they say they balance mostly for 3on3 arena, yet most people play random battlegrounds. And as a result you have an awful problem in regular bgs, especially when it comes to healers, and gear gaps. Yet those people seem to be only second rate customers for Blizzard and it doesnt seem to matter if they like playing in horribly broken matches where either one or the other side is camping the graveyard for most of the game, depending on whos got the better gear or the most healers(with better gear).<br />
<br />
Just look at one of the earlier hotfixes where they simply reduced all damage by 25%, yet no change to healing, even though healers have been very strong with the latest patch already, probably alot stronger than before, especially when it comes to disc priests. Those type of changes just feel like they are tapping around in the dark and see if something sticks. The intentions might be the right ones, but the way they do it, it just makes you think they just shoot from the hip with those things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest PvP is the reason most skills get adjusted. Still don't know why they just don't separate PvP and PvE completely and make double versions of each skill and ability, so they can balance PvP without messing with PvE and vice versa.</div></div><hr />

Are they adding 150 flight points/inns with WoD? Because that's about how many we'll need to bring the total gettable candy from ~630 up to 1000.</div></div><hr />

You mean only matters to you. News flash for you, the most populated servers in the USA are PvP focused servers.(Ex. Tich &amp; Dark) So I guess some people actually do give a damn after all.</div></div><hr />

I sure hope you're being sarcastic...they were 'weak'(not weakest by far btw, just moreso at lower gear levels), but if you'd been on in the last few days...you'd know they were a little to strong from 6.0 balancing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate to burst your bubble here, but most of the tuning changes that happen do in fact happen because of PvP. I'm strictly a raider. I can't even remember the last time I stepped foot in a BG or an arena, but even I am willing to acknowledge where most of our &quot;balancing&quot; changes come from.</div></div><hr />

When this game was released they didn't even have pvp. It was tacked on later as a mini game. How many new leveling zones, new dungeons, new raids are we getting next month? How many new battlegrounds? Yeah, I thought so.</div></div><hr />
