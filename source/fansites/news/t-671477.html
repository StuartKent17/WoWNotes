<br />
Quel'Delar's Rest is located in Icecrown and is north of Silent Vigil. It is ringed by small lantern stands, and a sword has been struck into the ice where there seems to be a dragon's skull underneath. It can be used as a landmark to help find the Argent Tournament Grounds since the road is directly north of the site.<br />
<br />
Speculation:<br />
<br />
The sword Quel'Serar is an obtainable sword which is forged in the breath of Onyxia. Upon returning the heated blade to Dire maul where it is finished for you the grand librarian tells you about how many versions Quel'Serar have existed through the ages. The properties of these swords are determined by which dragonflights breath heats the blade. He also tells of a legendary sword that once may have existed which held the properties of all 5 dragonflights and it was called the Prismatic Quel'Serar.<br />
<br />
Quel'Delar's rest has five arches and there are five lanterns hanging from these arches. In each lamp is a flame perhaps to represent the 5 dragonflights or even lit by the flames belonging to dragons of each flight. The base of the sword is aglow possibly to signify the swords power or its significance.</div></div><hr />

maybe for the plague wing boss in icecrown.<br />

The third floor in icecrown has 3 wings blood, plague and frost (which is where Sindragosa is)<br />

its just on plate so far so maybe just resist gear for the tanks.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure that Quel'delar is a sword. And I'm sure that Krasus wants it, but he's too lazy to do all the work himself, so he gets you to do it.<br />
<br />
Once you're done, he takes it from you and gives you some trinket and then shoves you off the top of Wyrmrest Temple.</div></div><hr />

And notice that it has the same stats as the leather items, and notice those are the same stats of an item already in game.<br />

All those gear pieces seem to just be placeholders. So no, there is no chance that those are the stats, and there will probably not be resistance gear required (especially nature) for the IC raid.</div></div><hr />

While on the other hand it serves as far more efficient for gearing up many guild members. The old system was stupid in how if you didn't get that token, you had to wait a week and that any Tokens for slots you alreayd had were wasted. Now Any token is useful, and even not getting one you can still progress towards better gear.</div></div><hr />

While I do agree it can be frustrating, to me it feels like Tier sets have become just too easy to acquire. I mean, if people are running around in Tier 10 sets a couple weeks after this patch is released, what are they suppose to do till the release of Cataclysm? Sell badges for orbs...again?<br />
<br />
Right now, most people are done with Tier 9 and crusader orbs are dropping in price every week and the set has only been available since mid-August. If Tier 10 is suppose to last until the launch of Cataclysm, I sincerely hope it takes at LEAST a few weeks or a month to even acquire a single piece</div></div><hr />

DONT MAKE ME FORCED TO RAID OLD CONTENT I HAVE RAIDIED A MILLION TIMES ALREADY TO GET MY NEW TIER 10 SET PLEASE.<br />
<br />
<br />
If Blizzard plan to make tier 10 requirements to raid old instances, it might be time for me to leave the game, i don't want to be foreced to raid Sartharion, Malygos, Ulduar, Naxxramus again to get tier 10, this is a step to far into milking a product as much as you can milk it. I simply don't find these instances fun anymore and am sick of them, being forced to do them for new gear will kill this game for me.<br />
<br />

If you want to do it the hard way then go raid Icecrown and skip the weekly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Calm down, calm down. You are not going to be forced to do them.<br />
<br />
You'll be down 10 emblems a week, but you won't be forced to do it.<br />
<br />
And I personally don't really care if I have to do content I've passed over already. They'd be facerolls anyway. Plus, this is the last content patch for Wrath...it means we have only a few months of this content being viable left. Then we will never have to worry about it again save for achievements.<br />
<br />
<br />
There won't be a progress guild in the whole game that won't raid old content to get badges of frost if they are to be used for tier 10.<br />
<br />
And this forces each guild member to raid the old content with their guild.<br />
<br />
If a player was to say to his guildeess &quot;I dont want to raid old content because i'm sick of it&quot;, then that player will be forced out his guild one way or another.<br />
<br />
It is very naive of you to think otherwise.<br />
<br />
Anyway, maybe alot will have fun raiding all old content to get new gear, but not me, this is one step too far for me to enjoy the game, i won't find it fun at all.<br />
<br />
Will wait and see if this is the case, but if it is, i don't think i'll be playing the game much longer, i have been playing almost 5 years now, but enough is enough.<br />
<br />
I want new content for new gear, being forced to raid old content to get an edge is Blizzard treating players for fools. How much money do they want to milk from us to play old content?<br />
<br />
Because that's all it is, they have devised a system where you are paying to play old content over and over again and i'm afraid that just isn't a good time investment for me.<br />

I don't understand what the big deal is. All of these weekly raid quests involve killing a boss that's either 1st or 2nd in their respective raid. (Given, we don't know anything about Lord Marrowgar or where in Icecrown Citadel he is, but given that all the others are very early bosses, it would be reasonable to guess that he will be an early boss as well.) So, you throw together a group, kill 1-2 bosses to get to/kill the one you need, and then leave the instance. No one says you have to bring in people who need gear from the instances, nor that you have to finish them. What's a boss or two each week for some extra emblems?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are just whining. Seriously, every single one of those quests is the first or second boss in the instance - at today's gear levels it will take ten to twenty minutes out of your entire week. But woe Blizzard for forcing you to do that! And for a reward stiff you with badges to buy gear and gems and then slap you in the face with 30 gold!<br />
<br />
Plus, as pointed out, the fact that your guild may 'force' you to do one or two old bosses once a week is your problem with your guild - not a problem with Blizzard's quests. You probably didn't whine about having to do heroics once a day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, why cant humans get moderate facial hair like Terenas there? I am tired of the play-doh hair that looks like a bunch of wooly caterpillers died on my face.<br />

I like the Daily Raids too. A great way to get gear for those alts that one can never seem to raid with</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shoat</div><div class="date">2009-10-02, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">* I don't like Shadowmourne's alt model as much as the other one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that you mention it...<br />
<br />
The second Model for it suggests that Shadowmourne is either:<br />
<br />
- A weapon similar to Benediction/Anathema: Two forms to choose from.<br />
or<br />
- An Epic Axe (using the alternate model) that starts a quest chain to upgrade/empower it with whatever (upgrades it to the glowy awesome model we saw first), but you can still use it while on your way to finish the quest just like you could use the crafted sulfuras hammer before getting an eye of sulfuras. At least this way the quest item wouldn't be useless while collecting whatever is needed for the quest.<br />
<br />
It could also be that the quest item drops from a normal mode boss, but the quest can only be completed by doing hardmode Arthas. That way normal guilds will have unupgraded Shadowmourne's available while hardmode-raiders can upgrade em to legendarys.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it could just be one of those item models that will never be used and will rot inside the item database forever.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sturmbringe</div><div class="date">2009-10-02, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There won't be a progress guild in the whole game that won't raid old content to get badges of frost if they are to be used for tier 10.<br />
<br />
And this forces each guild member to raid the old content with their guild.<br />
<br />
If a player was to say to his guildeess &quot;I dont want to raid old content because i'm sick of it&quot;, then that player will be forced out his guild one way or another.<br />
<br />
It is very naive of you to think otherwise.<br />
<br />
Anyway, maybe alot will have fun raiding all old content to get new gear, but not me, this is one step too far for me to enjoy the game, i won't find it fun at all.<br />
<br />
Will wait and see if this is the case, but if it is, i don't think i'll be playing the game much longer, i have been playing almost 5 years now, but enough is enough.<br />
<br />
I want new content for new gear, being forced to raid old content to get an edge is Blizzard treating players for fools. How much money do they want to milk from us to play old content?<br />
<br />
Because that's all it is, they have devised a system where you are paying to play old content over and over again and i'm afraid that just isn't a good time investment for me.<br />
<br />
No thanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all, if you have played WoW for 5 years already chances are that you will still play it for quite some time to come.<br />
<br />
Secondly, I can tell you why Naxx 25 bosses quests were added.<br />
<br />
Nobody from serious guilds had any reason to do Naxx 25 any more, so they didn`t. That left people who still needed gear out of Naxx 25 form Pugs, and wipe endlessly at Thaddius. SOmetimes, you couldn`t find no two Priests willing to do Razuvious in the entire server, so that meant that even if you could beat Thaddius you could not complete the instance.<br />
<br />
You need at least two Priests to complete the Instructor encounter when you are in an ordinary (non-pro) PUG.<br />
<br />
The alternative Bliz had was to nerf both Razuvious (adding mind control orbs at the 25 man encounter) and Thaddius, so as to make Naxx 25 puggable straight from the trade channel. Looks like they didn`t want to do that.<br />
<br />
Even so, I think that the `Kill Patchy` thing has to be changed to `Kill Thaddius`. Patchy can be killed by a bunch of bad Puggies straight from the Trade Channel while Thaddius requires a better group composition, and what is more it is a very fun and cool fight when you are in a decent guild with good players. I will be posting this suggestion (Change Patchy to Thaddius) asap.</div></div><hr />

This is EXACTLY correct.<br />
<br />
I dont want to do Naxx 25 anymore, and now to stay competitive i am forced to.<br />
<br />
I know exaclty the reasons they have done this, its to boost the amount of people who run the raid instances, im not dumb, i knew this before i made my posts here.<br />
<br />
For the people that want to do Naxx this is great news, they get to play with veterans who are FORCED to do the raid if they want to stay competitive in the game.<br />
<br />
I have a BIG problem with this, since i do not wish to raid old content any longer.<br />
<br />
I guess i will just have to find a way to make it appear that i'm not skipping raids with my guildees and tell them i'm washing my hair or something. I have no intention of running older raid instances that i'm completely bored with.<br />
<br />
I think it's a cheap shot by Blizzard to FORCE people to run older content.<br />

Yor making a big deal out of nothing. Most of the weekly raid quests will be doable with 30min (some exceptions). Since you only need to do that one and only particular boss for the weekly raidquest. <br />
Its pathetic if you dont want to have that small amount of time to get 10 emblems of frost.<br />
<br />
Besides its for 10m raids aswell, if im correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Skipping daily/weekly quests that reward emblems doesn't make it impossible to stay competitive, just harder.<br />
<br />
See it this way:<br />
If you raid ICC, you will have more then enough frost badges to buy ANYTHING you want within a reasonable amount of time.<br />
If you also do the weekly raid quests you will, on the long run, maybe have it one or two IDs earlier.<br />
<br />
In the end it doesn't make any difference. You'll be buying orbs/gems with them anyway after the first one or two months, because by then you're decked out in gear equal/better to what's available for emblems.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, note that it can be done on 10-man-easy-mode. And those bosses all are the first (or one of the first) bosses in their instances.<br />
In most cases it'll take less time then farming VoA.</div></div><hr />

I agree, after raiding and doing the daily on my main, I can't be arsed to do it on all my alts as well. At least a weekly raid would be easy to do several times with different characters. Especially if 10/25 man are treated the same.</div></div><hr />

This seems to be the Quel'delar questline. You find the sword and reforge it in the new instances, then something happens in the Halls of Reflection (against Arthas I guess) and the sword becomes &quot;evil&quot; and you have to take it to the Sunwell to cleanse it. It seems like the full questline isn't implemented yet.<br />

Doubt it. they'll probably still keep the 'spell costs of lower ranks use same mana as highest rank' rule. Only issue then would be if you could get around it by not buying the higher rank in the first place....<br />

I am also FURIOUS that I will have to step into Naxx or OS for 10 minutes to get an easy 10 emblems once a week! This is MUCH more frustrating than running old and lame heroics once a day for 2 emblems!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get that...<br />
<br />
But in the past, before some patch in TBC, healers used to do what is called 'downranking'. say you had two versions of the same spell, call them Heal (rank 10) and Heal (rank 15). Players used to more often use heal (rank 10) as the mana cost was lower, and the lower heal was often just overheal and wasted.<br />
<br />
Blizz changed that, so the mana cost of all ranks of spells was the same. Which removed downranking. <br />
<br />
If they change the mana cost of lower ranks without keeping that in place, we have downranking again. If they somehow make it so it changes when you only have the highest rank, then mix/maxer will create healers which do not buy the highest rank of heal, so they have the lower mana cost...<br />
<br />
The only real way around this would be to have some scaling system which increases mana cost of spells as you level, or as you get access to the higher healing spells.</div></div><hr />

Yea that is an option, but something i don't want to do tbh.<br />
<br />
I enjoy playing with my friends. I enjoy looking forward to new content, exploring new raids, working towards new gear and having fun with new content.<br />
<br />
That is why i feel a bit miffed at having to work backwards to get new gear.<br />
<br />
Quitting a game i love because i don't enjoy a major aspect of the game that will be introduced is a particularly sucky thing to happen. <br />
<br />
Gearing up is a major aspect in character progression.<br />
<br />
Reverse / Backwards content in order to progress your character is something i have a REAL problem with.<br />
<br />
I want CONTENT AND CHARACTER progression, not backwards content in order to move my character forward.<br />
<br />
It's retarded and definately something that will influence my enjoyability of the game.<br />

I'll underling my point in red so people can quickly glance at the issue i have - <br />

You're an idiot. Shut up.<br />
<br />
No one's forcing you to do crap. You'll still be competitive from getting your badges inside Ice Crown. Even if you get 10 less a week (whoopty doo!)<br />
<br />
If you don't like it, don't do it. Quit acting like a god damn cry baby. If you played from UBRS like you claim, you'd also remember a time when we didn't get epics thrown in our faces left and right with minimal effort. <br />
<br />
I swear to god.... People bitch about the game getting too casual and that epics are too easy &quot;wahhhh wahhh&quot; then they cry when something is released that means they have to do a little more work that's completely optional. <br />
<br />
I seriously doubt you remember how much &quot;old content&quot; vanilla forced us through in order to get resist gear. Either that or you never raided.</div></div><hr />

Imo its not that big of a deal. Your doing daily heroics which technically all that content should be dead, but we still do it. Its giving you another way to get a few pieces of gold and a chance to get a few emblems.</div></div><hr />

How about Icecrown Citadel dropping enough badges to' take care of Icecrown loot? That's all we ask.<br />
This is a GAME. Its meant to be fun.

Hope your damn eyes and at least admit you're being MILKED. But since you're so brainwashed that your answer is &quot;thank god its only half an hour&quot; , I guess its too late.

Nobody is forcing you to do raid old content to get new gear - just raid IC.<br />
Yes, you're right, it will be easier for people who will raid old content to get new gear, because they will get more badges. But I mean... cmon, look at list of bosses to kill... are they even hard to pug? or do it with guild? Will take UP to 30 minutes to kill ANY of these, which is faster than doing 5x daily heroics in overall. You dont need 25 man, you can do it in 10 man - doesnt matter...<br />

It's still not a necessity anywhere except in your head where you think X extra badges a week at the price of 10-20 minutes is imposing a huge burden on you. It will literally be something that guilds simply pop off at the beginning of a raid night and then head on to Icecrown.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Any progression guild will work this weekly into their raiding schedule until the guild as a whole no longer finds it necessary. It will be similar to doing a guild VoA 25 before a raid. Funny how people never whine about that....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well maybe if you looked a bit further into the situation you will see this is bad for casuals and pugs aswell.<br />
<br />
Veterans who go into these raid instances to get badges they feel they have to collect will get saved to that raid instance with their guild groups. Chances are they won't bother going back to complete the instance since they are saved with their main raiding set up in their guild and they don't even have a choice to PUG it or not anymore since they become saved anyway.<br />
<br />
Had they wanted to do badge runs in pugs, they are now not able to as they are saved with their guild.<br />
<br />
PUGS and casuals also lose out in this situation as they will now not get to play with veteran badge farmers.<br />
<br />
So yea, you can go with your &quot;it's a great thing to happen&quot; thinking, but it clearly is a bad idea.<br />
<br />
Veterans who feel forced into doing this will resent it, and PUGS lose out on decent players who might have wanted to do badge runs.<br />

<br />
Why shouldn't it be there for those who choose to do it. If they implemented a feature that was something like &quot;Do this raid every week or else we delete all your gear, de-level your character by 5 levels, burn your house down, and punch your Mom in the face.&quot; then that would be something would be a burden and that players would have to do.<br />
<br />
You seem to mistake optional for mandatory. <br />
<br />
It's there to be done if you want to do it. Or you can choose to ignore it altogether. <br />
<br />
Your problem with this is that because it's in the game you're under the illusion that you have to do it. Which is your choice. <br />
<br />
There are many things in this game that can feel mandatory for certain aspects. Proper gems, specs, glyphs, enchants. This is not one of those things.</div></div><hr />

Because the choice to raid old content is already there.<br />
<br />
If you want to do it you can, if you don't want to you don't have to.<br />
<br />
Making old content necessary to progress your character's development is TAKING CHOICE AWAY.<br />
<br />
Your argument of &quot;choice&quot; is flawed in every way possible SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE CHOICE IF WE WANT TO RAID OLD CONTENT OR NOT.<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
If your guild is good, you wont have to pug for this. At least I know my guild will go in together and do this. So from that point your right, but the so called &quot;raider&quot; will go in with their &quot;raiding&quot; guild lol.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VileMethoD</div><div class="date">2009-10-02, 10:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because the choice to raid old content is already there.<br />
<br />
If you want to do it you can, if you don't want to you don't have to.<br />
<br />
Making old content necessary to progress your character's development is TAKING CHOICE AWAY.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your argument of &quot;choice&quot; is flawed in every way possible SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE CHOICE IF WE WANT TO RAID OLD CONTENT OR NOT.<br />
<br />
<br />
And you'll still have that choice. Nothing is being taken away.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nubnub2009</div><div class="date">2009-10-02, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And you'll still have that choice. Nothing is being taken away.<br />
<br />
<br />
But the difference is, if i choose NOT to raid old content, it will now have a detrimental affect on my character progression, whereas before it did not matter.<br />
<br />
I refuse to believe you are so dumb as to not understand this, and if you can't understand it, then ye, you deserve to be one of these guys raiding old content over and over again to get your new gear ;)<br />
<br />
I also want to repeat this, as it's also an important factor about this change - <br />
<br />
PUGS lose out on decent players who might have wanted to do full badge runs (for gems or w/e), since that &quot;decent&quot; player will be saved to guild runs who only went in that particular old raid instance to kill the one boss for that quest.<br />
<br />
It's a change that doesn't help casuals, pug's OR veterans who don't want to raid old content.<br />
<br />
It's just a lose-lose-lose situation which has not been clearly thought out by those brainiacs at Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know how clearer i can say this - Being FORCED to raid OLD content in order to competitively PROGRESS YOUR CHARACTER is retarded and simply not a welcoming thought.<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's you who doesn't understand. It would be considered FORCED (because caps makes a point, why italicize to make emphasis) if you're character could not progress any other way. However, you can raid Ice Crown and progress there as well.<br />
<br />
If you're trying to say &quot;Well then I slow down my character progression&quot;. It's no different then doing a raid for weeks in a row and not seeing a drop you need and someone else getting a full set in that time. Those drops not dropping sure slow down character progression don't they? Why not go cry about that. &quot;Wahhhh my loot didn't drop this isn't fair it's slowing my progression waaahhhhh.&quot;<br />
<br />
Your views on progression are delusional because in no way does this weekly quest seem mandatory enough that it will halt character progression. Unless you're a badge hero who only ever gets gear from Badge Vendors. In which case you should welcome this change.</div></div><hr />

The patch of all patches is about to hit the ptr (Or did just hit) and the only thing they can complain about is a weekly raid quest that requires you to kill a random raid boss out of a selection of around 10.<br />
Just because it gives a few badges.<br />

See above answer. You didn't &quot;stump&quot; me, i just chose not to respond to your post since i have determined that since you are new to this game you wouldn't of (and don't) have understanding or connection with my above answer.<br />
<br />
Anyways, i've voiced my anger over these changes (something i rarely do since most of the game i find very enjoyable anyway), but ye, in order to stay competitive, we have backwards raid content to progress forwards your character.<br />
<br />
I find this displeasing, retarded and a total mlik of the game.<br />
<br />
If i don't enjoy it i will move on and find something else to do with my PC gaming time. Sad for me since i love this game, but ye, no one will care about another player going, and as long as Blizzard earns their money they don't care either.</div></div><hr />

Of course you won't answer. Because you're wrong. You're competitive progression doesn't exist. Because nothing in this game is 100% equal. <br />

If Blizzard plan to make tier 10 requirements to raid old instances, it might be time for me to leave the game, i don't want to be foreced to raid Sartharion, Malygos, Ulduar, Naxxramus again to get tier 10, this is a step to far into milking a product as much as you can milk it.

You are wrong. Nobody FORCES you. Don't do it and it is just as fine. It is 10 badges per week for kiling a boss. <br />

<br />
<br />
Mhm.<br />

<br />
Are you telling me veterans might be worried about grabbing 10 quick badges in an Ulduar 10 and going &quot;Oh noes..I so wanted to finish this place&quot;. Why would a PuG want to finish U 10 or U 25 after that weekly boss? The better gear is now elsewhere. If you plan on doing a full Ulduar or naxx clar with the weekly quest - just organize it that way.</div></div><hr />

You are not forced to do anything, but as the other guys said: Maybe you keep losing out on that one drop (I did't get T8.5 shoulders from Yogg for 12 bloody weeks in a row) - and then you can buy that with emblems (bought the T9.25 non set shoulder eventually).<br />

<br />
<br />
First off, I highly doubt you are in any way in a &quot;top guild&quot;. In fact I'm confident you're not.<br />
<br />
Good guilds will generally progress regardless if they're completely gear capped because of their skill and group synergy. ToC is an excellent example of this. You seem to be the kind of player that has to out gear an instance in order to clear it. That's not being competitive. That's being bad. <br />
<br />
You're stupid. <br />
<br />
You're a god damn cry baby who wants everything handed to them. Like I said in my very first post, there's a big difference between mandatory and optional. Mandatory was Vanilla farming resist. Mandatory was attunements. This is not mandatory. You can still clear all the content just as fast as any &quot;top guild&quot; without doing this weekly. Why? Because most &quot;top guilds&quot; clear this crap within weeks of launch. Let's say one month as a base. In one month you would get 40 badges. That's not enough to gear the hell out. It's just enough to maybe grab a high cost piece a couple a week from then. <br />
<br />
So let me repeat. You're stupid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ignorance can be cured with a book, stupidity can only be cured with a shotgun and a shovel.&quot;<br />

<br />
I don't mind who agrees and who disagrees. I like listening about other people's points of view and deciding for myself if i, in turn, agree or disagree.<br />
<br />
That guy didn't understand what i was saying (because he was unaware the competitive raiding means gearing up as fast as possible, which means being forced to run old content to grab these 10 badges if you want to remain competitive), that was what made him dumb, not the fact that he disagrees with me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I now find myself in the same position of looking at alternative games because of this change.<br />
<br />
Oh well, maybe it will be for the best for veterans to quit WoW anyway, maybe give the new players a chance to take the game somewhere ;)<br />

I hate to make these kinds of posts, but seriously, do you really think anyone cares? Your entire argument boils down to 'I don't think it's fun going to old dungeons and my comm are such a bunch of gear whores that they're going to force me to spend the first 15 minutes of a raid downing Flame Lootathon for badges, therefore I'm going to quit for Aion'. Do you really think someone in Blizzard HQ is going to push the big red panic button and scream 'NubNub is quitting WOW because of this change, quick, remove the quests immediately!!!' Nobody cares about your opinion (which seems to be in the vast minority based on replies to this post).<br />
<br />
Seriously, have some fucking perspective. Blizzard are about to release 3 epic 5 mans and a truly epic raid dungeon that's the culmination of a storyline that began in Warcraft 3, and what's likely to be the most challenging and fun content of the entire expansion, and you're emo-ing about quitting because you might have to spend 10 minutes killing Patchie? FFS, have a chat to your guild and get them to do him as a 10 minute post-raid fun run- if you're in TOTC hard mode gear they could probably 10-man Heroic Patchie and let you go to bed.<br />
<br />
I've played since Closed Beta so I'm more of a veteran than most, and I can honestly say yours is the most retarded reason for quitting 5 years of playing WOW that I've ever heard...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nubnub2009</div><div class="date">2009-10-02, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I highly doubt you are in any way in a &quot;top guild&quot;. In fact I'm confident you're not.<br />
<br />
Good guilds will generally progress regardless if they're completely gear capped because of their skill and group synergy. ToC is an excellent example of this. You seem to be the kind of player that has to out gear an instance in order to clear it. That's not being competitive. That's being bad. <br />
<br />
You're stupid. <br />
<br />
You're a god damn cry baby who wants everything handed to them. Like I said in my very first post, there's a big difference between mandatory and optional. Mandatory was Vanilla farming resist. Mandatory was attunements. This is not mandatory. You can still clear all the content just as fast as any &quot;top guild&quot; without doing this weekly. Why? Because most &quot;top guilds&quot; clear this crap within weeks of launch. Let's say one month as a base. In one month you would get 40 badges. That's not enough to gear the hell out. It's just enough to maybe grab a high cost piece a couple a week from then. <br />
<br />
So let me repeat. You're stupid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Ignorance can be cured with a book, stupidity can only be cured with a shotgun and a shovel.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
All top guilds will make farming these badges mandatory.<br />
<br />
Tell me i'm wrong, i double dare you.</div></div><hr />

All top guilds will clear the content before those badges make any significant difference. <br />

Well said. I know people in my guild will be kicking and screaming to get into that pwnfaceroll weekly 10 man (with mains and all their alts) to grab 10 badges in 10 mins.<br />
<br />
Big fat &quot;Thumbs up&quot; from me.</div></div><hr />

Well durr....of course they will. <br />
<br />
Just as a cutting edge guild might go do Scholomance for dark runes to do General Vezzax hardmode<br />
<br />
OMG old content to give an edge...the world is falling!!!</div></div><hr />

You are wrong on the &quot;mandatory&quot;. The players in the top guilds will just do it and have fun 5 manning 10 man content. If you are in a top guild, you don't need to be told. You just bloody DO IT.<br />
<br />

You are right :)</div></div><hr />
