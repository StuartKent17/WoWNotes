Upcoming Siege of Orgrimmar Changes<br />
You can see Heroic progression in our recent news post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3678-Armory-Stats-Heroic-SoO-Progression-Blizzard-CS-Callback-Blue-Tweets-Fan-Art). <br />
Effective with next week’s raid resets, we will be making some targeted difficulty adjustments to a few encounters in Siege of Orgrimmar. Overall, the difficulty curve in Siege has met our expectations, and while there are some major challenges deep in Garrosh’s sanctum, we see raid groups continuing to make steady progress at all levels. However, there are a handful of encounters at specific sizes/difficulties that present a disproportionate jump in challenge, and so we’re making some adjustments to smooth out the difficulty curve overall. We wanted to provide a bit of advance notice, both for guilds that are extremely close to kills and want to get in under the wire with the coveted “pre-nerf” kill, and to provide some hope to those who are looking at the wall ahead of them and despairing.<br />
<br />
Galakras<br />
We will be reducing the health of the Kor’kron troops in 10-player Normal and Flexible difficulty, because smaller raid groups have fewer tools to deal with the various enemies, and are further impacted when a portion of the raid must break off to deal with towers. No changes to Heroic difficulty at this time.<br />
<br />
Thok the Bloodthirsty<br />
We will reduce Thok’s unavoidable Fearsome Roar and Shock Blast damage in 10-player Normal, Heroic, and Flexible mode – again, smaller raid groups have fewer raid cooldowns to handle the increasing damage as Acceleration ramps, and we’re seeing 10-player and smaller Flex groups having much more difficulty with this encounter than their 25-player counterparts.<br />
<br />
Siegecrafter Blackfuse<br />
This encounter’s Heroic mode is a huge step up in difficulty from the preceding 11 bosses. We’re looking to smooth out that spike somewhat, while still keeping the fight quite challenging. The following changes apply only to Heroic difficulty: We are reducing the unavoidable raidwide damage inflicted by Magnetic Crush and Shredders’ Overload, as well as the damage from Superheated (to make belt groups’ lives a bit less painful when an Overcharged Laser is active). We’re also reducing Disassembled Turret health. Finally, on 10-player Heroic only, we’re reducing the health of Crawler Mines, since 10-player raids have fewer available tools to keep them controlled.<br />
<br />
Paragons of the Klaxxi<br />
Moving on to Heroic Paragons, we’d like them to continue a steady increase in difficulty that culminates with Garrosh. They’re already pretty close to that, so we’re just making a couple of tweaks here, reducing the damage of Multi-Shot and Fiery Edge on Heroic difficulty. This should keep most of the coordination difficulty of the fight, but reduce some frustrating deaths due to burst damage interactions between different abilities.<br />
<br />
We have no further changes planned at this time, but we’ll continue to monitor players’ ongoing progress through Siege of Orgrimmar, and may make further adjustments if needed.</div></div><hr />

Glad to hear about these :D To further comment, I think that all these changes are warranted for the groups they were targeted at.

The adjustments to 10m Thok make sense, but the blanket nerfs on Siegecrafter are odd. The only real damage present on that fight is the magnetic crush and overload. Reducing the damage from the only unavoidable damage sources just makes the fight a whole lot easier. Additionally, the superheated nerf doesn't make much sense. If your belt team is intelligent then you just need some hots thrown on them before they get 1-2 stacks of superheated during overloaded lasers. It was only deadly &gt;2 stacks, which is completely avoidable.</div></div><hr />

That's not how raiding works and you know it. There is more than just the two extremes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thursley</div><div class="date">2014-01-17, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm a bit confused about the changes to heroic Siegecrafter Blackfuse. I understand the spirit of the changes but the actual implementation is strange because most of those changes are to things that don't make the fight hard, as evidenced by the number of guilds that use 4 healers. Lowering the unavoidable damage will only increase the pressure to run lower healing compositions.<br />
<br />
Also, it's completely unclear what &quot;Disassembled Turret&quot; is referring to. There are 4 objects on the belt, none of which bear that name: Disassembled Crawler Mines, Deactivated Missile Turret, Deactivated Laser Turret, Deactivated Electromagnet. Context would indicate he meant only the laser turret, but nerfing the health of only 1 of the weapons seems very weird. It could mean both things that are &quot;turrets&quot; and not the mines or magnets but that is equally weird. I would think it means they are nerfing the HP of all of them, which makes the most sense, but the statement &quot;disassembled turret&quot; is clearly singular in nature and while you could argue that the electromagnet is turret-like, the crawler mines are a tougher sell. I guess he's just using the term to refer to all of the weapons and whoever wrote it didn't realize there were differences. The other options are just too strange.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly if you are stuck at Thok at this point, getting past Klaxxi Heroic pre-nerf will be literally impossible for you until the very end of this tier. Siegecrafter is an INSANE jump in difficulty, EVERYTHING has to go perfectly to get a kill. Same with Klaxxi pretty much, but it's much more about personal movement, where as on Siegecrafter you move as a group and can cause wipe by moving to the back of the group instead of side. Thok is only a block if you lack good healers or healers overall.</div></div><hr />

You're being judgemental. I am not stuck at Thok first of all, and I know not where you gather that from. Second of all you are just pulling things straight out of your ass by saying that it's impossible for one to get past Klaxxi because of it. I don't think that you know how progression works. Why &quot;the end of the tier&quot;? That is MONTHS from now, people in my group are close to BiS already. There is nothing which prevents my group from killing those bosses besides practise on those bosses. This applies for every guild with competent members by the way.<br />
I don't appreciate that blizzard is removing some of the joy that I get from progression raiding.</div></div><hr />

Ahead of the Curve requires you to kill Garrosh normal which has recieved no nerfs at all. I don't see a point to remove the FoS if the FoS requred boss wasn't touched in difficulty. Sure it may be SLIGHTLY easier to get to him now, but it doesn't make beating him any easier.</div></div><hr />

This nerf really puts my guild in a weird spot as we are somewhat close to killing heroic seigecrafter and we have 1 raid night left before reset. I'm really hoping we find to a way to kill it cause if we go in on tuesday and 1 shot it, it will take any and all satisfaction out of the kill.

i don't see the issue. elitist have killed all these encounters a long time ago.<br />
wowprogress rankings is all they care about and since. as of this moment 150 10-man guild and 150 25-man guild have killed Garrosh. and these nerfs only help the guild that are still trying to kill him by slightly adjusting the bosses before him so they can get there faster if they choose not to extend a lockout.<br />
if you are part of one of the 200 25-man guilds or 400 10-man guilds that has already killed the klaxxi, you shouldn't care about nerfs.<br />
<br />
i don't play high-end anymore, but when i did, i didn't care about nerfs. it just meant that we weren't good enough as a team, that we needed to much time and gear improvements.(yes the sunwell nerf was kinda painful but you can only blame yourself for not being that 1% better :D</div></div><hr />

You haven't even killed it since the nerfs, you have no indication of an amount for the nerfs. For all you know, these nerfs are 1% or less. Don't claim they over did it without any factual evidence. You sound silly.</div></div><hr />

How is stating that i would have liked the nerfs on Thok a bit later whining? that nerfs where coming was of course obvious but on the matter of Thok, it comes a bit to soon it would feel better if we had it before the nerfs now the actual date would be a blemish on wowprogress realm ranks.</div></div><hr />

Well, false. Any hardcore and some higher up semi hardcore progression teams are done with progression. The fact of the matter is that only 157 10 man guilds have cleared Heroic Siege. The vast majority of skilled, yet not as invested players haven't cleared yet.<br />
<br />
My response was directed at the 10 mans being faceroll. When in fact, this tier in particular, 10 man is way more unforgiving and challenging on an individual level on most of the bosses.</div></div><hr />

We did 25M until content was cleared than ran through with a 10man group, some are harder but as long as we ran range 10M wasn't much worse, the problems arise when guilds run too many melee in 10M heroic content.</div></div><hr />

Our 10 man group basicly did 2 new HC bosses/week untill we encounterd Siegecrafter where it went full stop. Our setup is good for the other 11, but for siegecrafter both the mine strat and the missile strat are a struggle not even close to the other HC bosses. These changes should have been in from the start, since its been pretty mutch stated that siegecrafter is alot harder on 10m. <br />

Added to that, its still only sbout 6% that have killed Thok HC, its not like these nerfs are gonna boost that number that very mutch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue with 25s breaking down into 10s and doing the content is that you still have 25 players at your disposal. This is something that most 10s don't. I know that our group runs with about 13 people. I'll lay out a scenario for you. On heroic Thok, 25s probably have 3-4 Paladins for that fight. Just with Devotion Aura alone, that's 24 seconds of raidwide immunity to silences, which lets healers to keep the raid up through the raid damage with ease. Now if you swap to 10 man, most would be lucky to have 2 Paladins. Still doable, but considerably harder. I guess this is mainly an issue with only one class bringing raidwide silence immunity, but that's the problem with the current 10 and 25 balance. But there is absolutely nothing &quot;faceroll&quot; about 10 man raiding in the current tier.</div></div><hr />

I stand by my comment. If somebody is going to play a game on the easiest mode and then say it's too easy without bothering to try the harder difficulties, they're just being lazy. If LFR was the only difficulty there would be a valid argument, but it's not, so it isn't.<br />
<br />
LFR is a joke tbh, but you really can't say the same about the other difficulties. Even Flex is a huge step up from LFR. Heroic is so far removed from Flex it's a different game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are nothing but toxic and you are only part of the communities problem.<br />
<br />
Why? Yes WoW's lore has always been and always will be PvE based, it is what continues the story and there is more room to do things with PvE content. With that said PvP may not be as important but it is still important in Warcraft. In Warcraft 3 you could play against other people (PvP) and all throughout WoW you could play against others. They have taken strides to make PvP competitive (introducing battlegrounds, then arena, then rated battlegrounds), so while WoW may be 60% PvE it is also 40% PvP. <br />
<br />
Now why are hardcore PvPers playing this game? Going to go out on a limb here and say.......they enjoy the game?!?! I know it is mind blowing, but people do just enjoy this game so it makes sense that they want to do what they like in the game they enjoy. If you can't see the value in PvP your opinion is the same as the PvPers who think PvE is useless/easy.</div></div><hr />

If you already have Heroic Garrosh on farm, who cares about these nerfs, you already got there, you are awesome! Everyone in your raid probably have the Garrosh's Scorpion mount by now.

It truly is the best fight since Ragnaros HC, if not on par with it, and progressing on in with your guild really pushes everyone to the limit. So much fun, and I'm afraid this nerf will lessen that experience. For example, now a player getting off the belt just as an overload hits won't be punished that much if he doesn't use a personal CD.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't mean they are lying. In my guilds case we went from a solid 11 at the start of the tier, to a roster of slightly over 20 people. A lot of the new people were people we absorbed from two guilds that died on the Alliance side of my server that were sniped this past month, who were already decently geared to at least 565. We have also obtained a few other recruits and returning players actively working on gear since. At this point, since everything up to the current boss is pretty much on farm, we rotate people in who need gear. We are very close to 25m ourselves, and switching is a possibility in the near future if we can get a decent roster above our 20 something. Most of them are cool with rotating till WoD, but if we get lucky, we may just change over.<br />
<br />

Why are PVEer's playing a PVP game? It's just as easy for anyone to make the argument from both sides. Almost all of the PvP players I know haven't set foot inside a raid this entire expansion. I play the game strictly for PvP, but I have long standing ties to my guild so I continue to to log on once a week and get beat on behind a shield for a few house each week, but my main focus in this game is PvP, since... you know, its not a scripted, mirror, player vs computer encounter.</div></div><hr />

It truly is the best fight since Ragnaros HC, if not on par with it, and progressing on in with your guild really pushes everyone to the limit. So much fun, and I'm afraid this nerf will lessen that experience. For example, now a player getting off the belt just as an overload hits won't be punished that much if he doesn't use a personal CD.<br />
<br />
A bit early for nerfs?????? Seriously???? 5.4 released on September 4th, 2013. It's January 17, 2014. That's over 4 months. Assuming WoD comes out this summer that puts initial nerfs about halfway through the tier which is what they did the past 2 expacs. Only this time they did targeted nerfs instead of an across the board nerf to everything in the raid. Frankly I don't care either way. But, every single time they nerf a tier I see these &quot;too early&quot; posts and it just makes me laugh. I mean come on, they do it every single time, stop acting surprised about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah ... I think they're trying to stay on top of 10-player guilds not hitting walls that are more about raid comp than about anything else. To an extent, yeah. A super hardcore 10-player guild will get the right comp. It's probably a fairly small niche of players that are hardcore enough to be on Siegecrafter/Paragons heroic but don't min/max on raid comp.<br />
<br />
But in any event, I'm glad they're still supporting 10-player raiding with it on its way out the door</div></div><hr />

But it's so obvious seeing how many 10mans are stuck on garrosh and how almost no one is stuck on lootagons.<br />
<br />
With siege/paragons nerf 25mans are pretty much just gonna faceroll their way 14/14hm because 25H garrosh is free loot compared to 10.</div></div><hr />

Wrong on so many fucking levels. Nerf Normal to the ground, I dont care (Yet, still dont see the point, since there is LFR and Flex). Heroics are Heroics for a reason, they should never need a nerf in the first place(Unless basicly unkillable, like Vashj, C'thun etc, as in hotfix nerfs to not have a broken encounter). I raid Heroic for a challenge, I dont want that challenge to decrease for &quot;people to see content&quot; (This was more an issue with blanket nerfs ala ICC/DS) When there is 3 more fucking difficulties to see the content on. Let heroics be heroics for fuck sake. And for the record, I am 8/14HC, and thus, will never get a chance to try out Thok, Blackfuse and Paragons on their &quot;intended&quot; difficulty. And that just fucking sucks. I dont care if we would wipe for 3 weeks straight when reaching Blackfuse.<br />
<br />
Back in TBC, my guild and I killed Magtheridon 1 day pre any nerf, looking back at it, I still find that to be one of my best WoW moments, (also because our main rival guild progression wise couldt not do it before the next week) Did it suck for them that they got an easy kill instead of a hard? I would guess so. I know I would have been pissed to not get it down that day, so would the other 24 people. And we were all happy we got to do it before it got sliced to fuck all.<br />

They have a target % value of participants they want to see complete a certain boss / difficulty. They will adjust numbers till that target is met.<br />
<br />
If the target is met, they either nerf upon new content or if progression stagnates.<br />

I am not a heroic mode raider - I would never claim to be even a &quot;good&quot; flex mode raider. However I agree that heroics should remain heroic and not be blanket nerfed. I CAN see maybe nerfing 10 man for the reasons Blizzard say - IF it is needed. I can not comment on if it is or not. Other people have a mode of raiding that works for them - for me its flex and lfr - let the people who want to do heroic - do heroic without the nerfs.<br />

However not everyone started on them the same time.... Someone could easily want the challenge but be behind. Someone could also want the challenge but simply not be as good as some others - it will take them longer - it doesnt mean they want it nerfed (of course some do). Reminds me of something someone said to me in LFR the other week when I asked something.... &quot;If you dont know, then you shouldnt ask!&quot; Well....

*We will reduce Thok’s unavoidable Fearsome Roar and Shock Blast damage in 10-player Normal, Heroic, and Flexible mode – again, smaller raid groups have fewer raid cooldowns to handle the increasing damage as Acceleration ramps up *<br />
<br />
Fearsome Roar is the frontal cone attack Thok does on the tanks and gives the debuff... and Fearsome Roar isnt effected by the rate of Thok's energy regen.. Deafening Screech IS effected by the energy increased regen, i guess its a typing mistake? because its sounds like you want to decrease the raid wide AOE damage that gets higher and higher as time goes by in phase 1.</div></div><hr />

I really don't understand how people still whine about this stuff when it has been the norm for so many years.<br />
We keep &quot;whining&quot; because the norm about nerfing HC's is stupid, and always will be. Seeing we now have 4 difficulties, I dont see the point. <br />
It made sens back in Classic, TBC, and somewhat Wrath if they wanted to meet &quot;their target value of participants. With 4 difficulties, that target can be met elsewhere than in HC, or even Normal.<br />
<br />
<br />
They have a target % value of participants they want to see complete a certain boss / difficulty. They will adjust numbers till that target is met.<br />
<br />
If the target is met, they either nerf upon new content or if progression stagnates.<br />
I see no problem with that.<br />
I get that, but even if 0.1% of the playerbase see the end game boss on HC, so what? If the target mark for say &quot;We want 60% of the playerbase to see end game&quot; and that 60% is met in LFR/Flex/Normal. Then whats the problem? Is it really necicarry that a certain amount of people see the HC end boss, or Normal end boss even? When the target mark is met in one of the other difficulties?<br />
<br />
Nerfing when new tier is out I dont really have a problem with, tho I still not see the point. Seeing as it will be outgeared soon enough, wont that make it &quot;easy&quot; enough..? Same with HC, it will get easier as gear comes along, so why nerf it? If people cant down a boss even in full BiS from the bosses they have killed, then they should just accept defeat and understand they aint good enough, instead of whine out loud &quot;We aint good enough, blizzard please make it easier for us!&quot;. I say fuck that, get better instead, it will help more in the long run. Tho, this nerf is far from the worst I have seen in my years.<br />
<br />
If it is a buisiness model issue, &quot;That boss makes us loose subscribers&quot;, I get it. But that doesnt mean we have to like it.</div></div><hr />

Nerfs are something that makes a gamechanger mechanicwise. u still have to do these fights the same way, same tactics, same kill order. only difference is you can breath out every now and then.<br />
<br />
im 11/14 hc and im happy on these balance changes to make it more suitable for me and my guilds skills/progress,</div></div><hr />

Some of us raid 2 days 2 hrs a week and are 8/14 heroic and would like a shot at those bosses in their original form when we get there.<br />
<br />
At 4 hours a week you ain't getting there before WoD. Sorry =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is: YOU aren't the indicator. Garrosh HC First Kill has already happened, long enough ago. And it seems like enough people have followed up on it. So it must be somewhat time to nerf those Encounters for whoever.</div></div><hr />

Honestly nerfs are welcome at this point, makes alt raids easier and easier to sell boosts. Looking forward to 30% raid wide nerf if that ever comes, will be easy to boost 5+ people on 25 HC at that point :D</div></div><hr />

I'm so sick of hearing this shit. <br />
<br />
The fact is, some fights are easier on 25, and others easier on 10. As somebody who raids both, i've seen those differences firsthand. Easy example - Heroic Norushen. It's a complete joke to do on 10m, while 25 is considerably more challenging.<br />
<br />
The biggest difference between 10 and 25 i've seen is that 10m raiders are more full of themselves.</div></div><hr />

25 is carebear mode.<br />
<br />
you cant trivialize fights in 10 by stacking raid cooldowns, or the best example, adding a third tank to trivialize h garrosh adds.<br />
<br />
not to mention it's quite possible for both your healers to get mind controlled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So please hold those comments to yourself next time.<br />
<br />
There is no &quot;maby&quot; about it. The raid has been out for months now. It doesn't matter if you just started raiding it today the raid has been there for months.<br />
<br />
Blizzard would like to see more people progress to garrosh at this stage of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Galakras change only applies to normal and flex NOT heroic. I guess they have data indicating normal/flex groups struggle on that encounter for the intended difficulty.</div></div><hr />

Dragon Soul, to make a comparison, started nerfing content just 2 months after launch. If anything, I commend Blizz for sticking it out as long as they did, but as they say, the show must go on. The remaining guilds working on the last 4 bosses (mine included), aren't the bleeding-edge super awesome guilds, and simply aren't as skilled as those from Method, Envy, Blood Legion, etc. Most casual raiders don't want to wipe 400 times on siegecrafter with no possible gear upgrades since everyone is already 575. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
The biggest challenge with 25s is simply organizing it. In HC, you can get a good set of players who can cooperate together for a raid at that skill level. With flex, you don't need a lot of coordination. 25 normal groups are the tough part as the players that are of that skill level often have enough issues to bring them below professional level and starting a raid within 30 minutes of the start time is lucky, not to mention getting everyone on the same page together.</div></div><hr />

Don't see whats to moan about its not like they will be super easy and a cakewalk now. It just means less wipes to get the kill (a good thing, unless you are odd and like to wipe 500x before a kill)</div></div><hr />
