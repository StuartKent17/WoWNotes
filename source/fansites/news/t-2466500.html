Bloomberg is reporting (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-08/activision-is-said-to-plan-job-cuts-as-sales-of-key-games-stall) that Activision is planning to cut hundreds of jobs next week.<br />
<br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard Inc. plans to announce job cuts Tuesday in the face of slowing sales, according to people familiar with the matter, bringing fresh upheaval after spotty results roiled stocks this week. The shares dropped as much as 2.5 percent to $42.88 on Friday.<br />
<br />
The layoffs, which could number in the hundreds, are part of a restructuring aimed at centralizing functions and boosting profit, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the changes haven’t been announced. Activision employed 9,800 people at the end of 2017.<br />
<br />
The game maker, one of the largest in the world, acknowledged on a November conference call that some key titles, such as Overwatch and Hearthstone, were seeing flat or declining numbers of users. After disappointing sales of Destiny 2: Forsaken, the company parted ways with its developer, Bungie Inc., a move that could reduce annual revenue by as much as $400 million.<br />

Love is in the Air Rewards – Level Requirement<br />
The annual holiday, Love is in the Air, begins on February 12 and ends part way through the day on February 26. For this, we are applying a hotfix that makes it so only characters who are level 110 or higher will be eligible daily to receive the box that contains the most-rare items from this event’s bosses (for the last two years it’s been set to level 98). You will also see this reflected in the next official Hotfixes update post.<br />
<br />
As a result of this, if you are hunting the Big Love Rocket you will want to get characters to at least level 110 for the event.<br />
<br />
Good luck collection hunters!<br />
<br />
is it still stupidly rare? You seem to be actively encouraging people to farm it on as many characters as possible which doesn’t strike me as a healthy gameplay habit to be encouraging.<br />
The drop rate hasn’t changed. We are aware of how some people push to farm it and wanted to avoid anybody feeling like there was a stealth change while we keep the availability focused on more active play.

Holiday Rewards – Level 110 Requirement<br />
Got some info back on this one, the Big Love Rocket mount will now only drop from the Heart-Shaped Box that players level 110 or higher receive from defeating The Crown Chemical Co.<br />

This is evident in the plummet in sub numbers. They don't need to (and likely never would) speak on it's decline. My friends list isn't a scientific study by any means, but when BFA launched I had about 20 people on at all times. Now I have 1 or 2 in an entire day.</div></div><hr />

Because blindly spreading lies and hating on something without source and prove is reasonable ?<br />

The gaming industry is long over due a crash 'n burn reminiscent of the early/mid 80's, but that doesn't mean I like the idea of people losing their jobs, least of all those who are basically front line minions without a parachute (unlike those near the top), even if I have concept disagreements with the directions they take.</div></div><hr />

I mean, he's right though. When an allied race is released token prices skyrocket, when token prices skyrocket Blizzard is making money. People can say &quot;lol I'm spending gold for it&quot; but the reality is someone spent $20 on that token for you to get $15. The same thing applies too when a store mount or pet is released, the token prices skyrocket and this is fact with evidence in the history of token prices.</div></div><hr />

Does that mean centralization on company level or on team levels? Removing some useless HR might be beneficial but I'm rather worried if that could mean bringing Activision and Blizzard closer.</div></div><hr />

The rationale behind its microscopic drop rate owes itself back to the era in which it was released where getting it automatically awarded you 310% mount speed skill, a pretty big deal at the time when the skill could not be bought and only earned through incredible gaming feats.</div></div><hr />

For those saying that they did not mention WoW. This is because WoW hasn't been close to the the popularity / moneymaking of HS and OW for awhile. And those 2 were the &quot;big&quot; games for Blizz. <br />

For those saying that they did not mention WoW. This is because WoW hasn't been close to the the popularity / moneymaking of HS and OW for awhile. And those 2 were the &quot;big&quot; games for Blizz. <br />

I still think WoW is a good game, but a lot of the in game mechanics and systems I see are designed to get people to keep playing for playing sake alone, not because they are good gameplay (titanforging, weeklies, emissaries, store stuff,etc).<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this is the same in the other games, but I feel like it's a bit of a shame that they don't just rely on making a good game.<br />

Because corporations only see numbers whatever business you’re in. It doesn’t matter if your in game development, retail or whatever you can work with. If you start to see red numbers the first and fastest decision you can make is to fire your employees. Then those who left to stay are those who have to work their asses off for the company. First then the corporate people will decide to hire more employees. <br />

People tend to forget all of the hard working devs and writers that have nothing to do with the BS the publishers and shareholders put out. Because when Blizzard does go out of business those scummy people get richer and are not affected at all and the real heroes of blizzard like the sound designers, the developers, and the creative writers get he short end. Those stockholders, those publishers, they don't mind, they'll get a massive cheque at the end.<br />

You know I agree 100% but I would rather the company succeed and learn and get better, maybe when those microtransaction laws get through world wide, they might go back to making good games with no strings attached. <br />

this sounds nice on paper but there is no learning process here. They keep doubling down on such things. You can only get so many second chances, and this company used up theirs a long time ago.<br />

<br />
Gee I wonder why? I personally stopped bothering with OW even skipping out on buying boxes for the new year event. I stopped because OW isn't willing to advance, they haven't created new modes in some time, maps and heroes come out at a rate of 1/2 a year. There's not enough happening to bring me back to that game, I loved the arcade addition but they've hardly built on it ever since.<br />
<br />
And hearthstone, I haven't played that in about 3 years I'm multiple expansions behind, if I wanted to get back into it and get the cards fully up too date I'm looking at spending a lot of time enduring the pain of being thrashed by whatever the new face deck is and if I want to spend, well that's £400 at least most likely.<br />
<br />
And as for WoW they've shot themselves in the foot so many times, the design of the game over the years has nose dived as they've moved into designing for retention rather than enjoyment, which has lead to so many things being gated. The constant &quot; we know what you want &quot; speech we get from Ion half the time and other devs is annoying as well, I personally don't like being told that from a guy who doesn't PvP or RP, he engages with a 1% part of the community that is mythic raiding yet somehow, this guy is game director.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reputation is for the longterm success almost as important as making good games. Blizz is learning that the hard way now.

You say that, but if Blizzard goes under the PC gaming space is gonna feel so empty. I owe most of my PC gaming obsession to be rooted in Blizzard. Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans was my first PC game. When I think of PC gaming outside Blizzard what other games companies offer as much as Blizzard do on PC? <br />
<br />
I guarantee you 'if' Blizzard ever go under and are gone. I am gonna be playing PC games far less. Especially since the RTS genre is also dead, combine that with Blizzard gone then PC gaming is dead to me lol. At least until Cyberpunk comes out. I don;t think we realise what a big impact Blizzard has on people especially people in my generation :P<br />
<br />
I do honestly believe Blizzard has lost touch with it's audience, where as once the company was a punch of white nerds and geeks who loved games is now just a company trying to fill a quota of society and making games second. But at the heart I still do believe they can make good games. And it is sad that the most anticipated games from Blizzard coming out soon are a remaster (Warcraft 3) and a re-release (WoW Classic). But if they can pull that big surprise out of their butts and get back on track I am with them all the way :)</div></div><hr />

Hey, if blizzard comes out tommorow, makes great games again, and proves me wrong and everyone would laugh at me: I would welcome it. I like to be wrong. I dont belive it tho.<br />

They did that it was called Wildstar and it sucked. Rare's former employees did the same and they made Yooka Laylee it also sucked. Has there been an instance where former employees went elsewhere and made better games than what their initial company did? I did play 2 Point Hospital recently from former employees of Bulldfrog who made Theme Hospital, that was good, not sure if it sold well though? <br />
<br />
Think that's the biggest problem, people are attached to brands not the developers who made it. Warcraft is a brand, people like Warcraft, if those devs left and went off and made another game under another company it probably wouldn't sell so well because it isn't warcraft. :P</div></div><hr />

And, if a restaurant isn't doing well, you don't cut the cooks, you cut waitstaff, and bussers and dishwashers. And you cut costs on ingredients, take some dishes off the menu, things like that. Cancel redecorating plans, cut advertising budgets, etc. Blizzard has over 3000 employees, doing all kinds of things, that aren't game development. They could fire the cafeteria staff. Cut admin budgets and make admins double up on who they support (that happened at a company I worked for, they cut the number of admins in the company in half the first round of layoffs.) Cut more phone support. Shut down small regional offices. Outsource marketing and sales. <br />
<br />
There's also no sign that it's ANY devs, or people at that level, and in layoffs, last hired, first fired is usually how it's handled. They'd be more apt to let go shiny new art team members fresh out of art school, or customer service, than the game's director. <br />

Lore I would not cry if they let him go. <br />

I'd bet the WoW teams lose a couple people, 20, 25, and low level grunt types, not the big decision makers. They're not at the point of letting go of people at Ion's level.<br />

<br />
The report of sales comes from the Q3 2018, which included the Battle for Azeroth release so naturally they wouldn't have negative things to say about WoW at that time.<br />
<br />
Q4 will be much more interesting, if they don't mention WoW at all (unlikely) that means it is very stagnant and not considered worth discussing. THey never discuss WoW to great detail at these calls though now that they don't show sub numbers.<br />
<br />
However you don't need to be an expert to see that WoW is in shart decline. The 6-month sub mount, two store mounts already this year, the cheeky placement of 8.1.5 to get people to sub for another month for the 2nd half of one patch. <br />
<br />
Not to mention any graph or metric you can find online from google trends to Website popularity graphs show a sharp decline, under anything pre-BFA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how can blizzard let activision do that to them?<br />
<br />
Because they’re the same company, that’s why. The thing is, WoW can provide for itself from sub subscriptions and expansions etc. I can’t see them cutting much, if any, from Blizzard’s biggest cash cow. They’ll start from the bottom up, so WoW won’t see that much of a cut I don’t think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, they very well may be for one region. Most of WoWs sub base from China, so if both regions (EU and NA) had 1.9 million subs that would be about 4 million subs for the western world and if you say China had like 3 million that would be 7 Million WW (more successful than WoD)<br />
<br />
That is definitely not the case. EU/NA both having about 1-1.3 Million subs would make sense with China being about 2.5 million.<br />
<br />
Yes these numbers are pulled out of no where but given the obvious state of decline the game is in it is not at all far fetched to say WoW has about 5M subs right now if not less.<br />
<br />
I am not sure if Blizzard factors China into their monthly subs that they use to show back in the day as they pay differently, but I would assume they did.</div></div><hr />

It's by far the most expensive game for me to play. I realize the irony considering it's ftp but either I'm ponying up or such with garbage decks. Don't have the time to earn packs, I'd pay a subscription to have access to all cards but not own them. There's no motivation for me to buy digital cards that become next to worthless once the set cycles out.<br />
<br />
As for overwatch, lack of creativity culminating in a shallow esport focused game.<br />
<br />
Diablo outsourced, this one is huge to me. I know they outsourced hellfire and even d1 was a team that was later integrated, but this is different. They're trading away their values for money and it's sad.<br />
<br />
Bfa is kind of a hot mess, nuff said.<br />

It's not a huge wonder things are kind of flat over there. I work in software and I've seen this happen time after time, they'll cut support and management roles and expect the same results. Drop bonuses, cut benefits etc.... <br />

Take another look, every time a mount or pet released in the last 90 days the prices jumped and ramped up before falling.<br />

Do you honestly believe Ion and Josh are all to blame? They are just 2 guys part of the much larger team. Blaming them for everything is completely ignorant.<br />
<br />
Ion and Josh are at least 80% to blame. Being Game Director Ion has the final say of where resources are allocated and where manpower goes towards development. Being head of Community Services and Relations Josh is to blame for bad feedback and lack of actual problems/bugs being fixed when many issues are on the forums, but never get fixed.</div></div><hr />

They should really not make old content into current relevant content.

When you are answerable to stake holders just making profit isn't enough anymore, decreasing levels of profit nomatter how well the business performs is still seen as a &quot;loss&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is what a lot of casual joes on the street don't seem to grasp. The investing world demands revenue/profit growth. <br />
<br />
Almost nobody buys a stock at $50 and is content for it to remain there or to very slowly go up to say $52 in 2-3 years.<br />
<br />
This creates an unreasonable and unhealthy fixation on growing profits constantly. If a company makes $1 billion in profit one year, and it falls to $800 million profit the next year, that shouldn't be a disaster, but in the investing world it is.<br />
<br />
Constant growth is clearly unsustainable but it's the singular demand of the market. That's why public companies are never are content to be where they are at and succeed. It's not a healthy situation but it's how much of the investing world works sadly.<br />

Not surprised HS is losing players. So boring cards lately! And packs are expensive as fuck! I know I won't buy any more packs myself.<br />
<br />
The online collectible card game genre grew to be a bubble that burst. None of the online card games have been doing well. I was playing Elder Scrolls Legends for awhile, it all but died. Gwent was supposed to be a big deal, it never went anywhere. Artifact was completely dead on arrival. And Hearthstone has been shrinking rapidly the past 12-18 months.<br />
<br />
Obviously there is still a large community that plays Hearthstone, but it pales in comparison to what it was. HS became the &quot;it&quot; game for 2 years or so for streamers and e-sports but nothing lasts forever. The online card game genre will persist but in a much smaller space.</div></div><hr />

tbh its not about that, its more like corporate greed. They are making a killing in $$$ its just their stockholders/board want more and more and more.<br />
<br />
on companies like that its always each year has to be more $. If you make 20% profit last year next year you need 30% if you stay at 20% they start thinking the product is not good, if you go to 15% oh no we need to do budget cuts and fire people... thats literally corporate greed, even though they are making too much money on profit each year its never enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Q4 will be much more interesting, if they don't mention WoW at all (unlikely) that means it is very stagnant and not considered worth discussing. THey never discuss WoW to great detail at these calls though now that they don't show sub numbers.<br />
<br />
However you don't need to be an expert to see that WoW is in shart decline. The 6-month sub mount, two store mounts already this year, the cheeky placement of 8.1.5 to get people to sub for another month for the 2nd half of one patch. <br />
<br />
Not to mention any graph or metric you can find online from google trends to Website popularity graphs show a sharp decline, under anything pre-BFA.<br />

<br />
People tend to forget all of the hard working devs and writers that have nothing to do with the BS the publishers and shareholders put out. Because when Blizzard does go out of business those scummy people get richer and are not affected at all and the real heroes of blizzard like the sound designers, the developers, and the creative writers get he short end. Those stockholders, those publishers, they don't mind, they'll get a massive cheque at the end.<br />

Sterling Cooper is essentially coerced into entering talks with PPL in regards to a take over. PPL take over, are hesitant and non compliant about investing in new business. They then lay off significant staff numbers, strip mine assets and, see and increase in financial value due to the cut backs and lay offs, make bonuses and ultimately attempt to sell Sterling Cooper and liquidate it for profit.<br />
<br />
The partners of Sterling Cooper learn of this, are denied the opportunity to buy back their firm and instead then get themselves fired along with the account man of PPL, by doing so they get out of their contracts with PPL and form a new firm SCDP.</div></div><hr />

100% agreed. Looking at the horrible mess a.k.a class design. Blizzard destroyed the most fundamental part of the game for all classes in BFA, big red warning signs everywhere on the beta feedback forums, all of the well written, well constructed feedback regarding classes &amp; specs didnt even get a single blue response. Ignored, just like that. <br />
<br />
There were bad expansions back then but no matter how bad the expacs were, the class designs always delivers (even for shaman), except for BFA this time. Blizzard really had no one to blame but themselves. This is what they deserve, for fucking up so badly. Hopefully they start with Ion. Dude absolutely destroyed the game i loved the most, adding GCD, pushing out terrible class designs and the most unforgivable, forcing personal loot down to all raiding guilds' throat.</div></div><hr />

100% agree, and this is only a part of the big mess shitfest that wow has become.Focusing so much on handing out max ilvl loot for every trash that goes afk in a shit designed warfront , ally pvp week quests , trash island expeditions that were announced like a major breakthrough before bfa , even the titanforging itself wich is shit...and many more examples that encourages players to have minimal interactions and zero knowledge about gamplay/class wich have made rectruiting for guilds so hard cuz playerbase skill level declined soo damn much..Oh and gating flying so damn much aswell..I don't fucking get it... Make it that you lvl up using ground mounts and then give option @ max level to unlock flying for those who want to( i belive that was the system in MOP).If they throw Ion out ( and i know he's not the only one to blame..but at least it s a big start) i will fuckin pay 1 more month just to celebrate:D</div></div><hr />

also no buyying the dreadwake was not force,d they literally said &quot;for those who do not want to buy 6 months, they can buy it from the store in 2019&quot;<br />
alos these mounts are made for the chinese servers, would you rather they be china only? or china plus we can buy it if we want.<br />

The partners of Sterling Cooper learn of this, are denied the opportunity to buy back their firm and instead then get themselves fired along with the account man of PPL, by doing so they get out of their contracts with PPL and form a new firm SCDP.<br />
<br />
I almost want this so Danuser, Golden, Lore and Ion get fired but the whole franchise will be rebooted if this happens because I can't picture wow to continue after such thing, thanks for the explanation pal</div></div><hr />

no you are going down the entire way. its going down, that is suspected, if it PLUMMITS then we woulda had an iddue, but really only did in wod, but that was only because it skyrocketed.<br />
<br />
wow has been going down since cata... pretty obvious and suspected... if something is already going down, it is not &quot;continuing to decline&quot; it has already declined, and is continuing on that path. if it goes down and down and keeps increasing the rate at which it goes down, yes.<br />

Dat ability to just blindly ignore all the facts in front of you and still come charging in White Knighting Bliz….Errr I mean Actilizzard Moneygrabment. They are still making a huge profit off WoW in just subscriptions (what few they still have world wide) and god knows how much money they rake in off store mounts and pets. Yet they are laying off employees left and right like they are barely able to make a buck. And here you come lol just protecting your buddies at good ol Blizz like somehow they will see your words and take heart lmao. You do realize the people who made Blizzard a loved company are all gone right? You have been paying attention as all of them have slowly made their escape and jumped ship? I bet you still think Disney is making really awesome Star Wars movies too right? Seriously how low do your standards have to go before you start to see reality?</div></div><hr />

WotLK aka first expansion that Activision stepped into Blizzards company and practices. Over time they're pushing more and more grabs. This is all evidenced as the game has only progressively gotten worse since Activision merged with Blizzard.<br />

<br />
- 2 Years. Pig and Dog.<br />
<br />
- And yet it's been over for months now and not in the store, hmm.<br />
<br />
- Got any proof of this? You don't, you're literally speaking out of your ass, just like you do in 95% of your posts.<br />
<br />
- BFA had much untested and unfinished content. To name a couple specific examples: Azerite Armor(outside of the 1 item you got from Magni at 110) came out on beta 3 weeks before the expansion was launching, so there was no time to test this and give feedback that would be even considered by the development team, this is why Azerite is STILL being worked on 4 months into the expansion. No &quot;core feature&quot; of an expansion should be a hot mess that still needs heavy adjustments months after the release. Another example is the M+ affixes, the Infested affix was on beta for 2 weeks to play, and yet none of the feedback was even acknowledged and so when Infested came out you had G'huunies falling through the floor, going through walls, infesting when interrupts/stuns went off. <br />
<br />

I hope you're not serious.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has input limits to how many times a character can do a dungeon, which is shared by all characters in all servers.<br />
You'd have to make sure an hour went by before you would be allowed to do another dungeon.<br />
<br />
So making new characters and deleting them would not only be a colossal waste of time, it would absolutely just not work<br />
in getting around that restriction.<br />
<br />
Out of all the bullshit reasons they'd have to keeping this level gating content, what you're suggesting would definitely not<br />
be one of them.</div></div><hr />

ummm what? you don't know how it works do you, are YOU serious?<br />
it is a daily, so no, people would make many characters, and then run it as many times as they could each day...<br />
<br />
are you serious?<br />
<br />
also anyone can do the dungeon, this just stops lower levels from being used to farm the mount.<br />
<br />
also lol level gating content? is EVERYTHING &quot;time gated&quot; now? remember back in vanilla when the shitty fucking devs level gated raids? what fucking scum forcing people to pay months of sub just so they could raid!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Even though its literally in one area, the encounter is still inside of a dungeon, and in order to get to this, you<br />
have to que up for it. Ergo, it counts as a dungeon run, regardless of how fast it is.<br />
<br />
I've farmed this on multiple alts that were at the level to do it in Legion. 12 toons max, and at the most IIRC,<br />
I could do the dungeon maybe 10 times with different alts before the game would hit me with a, &quot;you have<br />
entered too many instances recently&quot;, jargin, forcing me to have to wait at least an hour before I could finish<br />
with the other alts.<br />
<br />
So no, just because its a daily quest doesn't mean anything. You still have to wait.<br />
<br />
<br />
also anyone can do the dungeon, this just stops lower levels from being used to farm the mount.<br />
<br />
I again ask, is there a **good** reason for this? Your answer isn't, and so far others have had more plausible<br />
ones (i.e. Blizzard is fucking greedy). So do YOU have an actual intelligent and legitimate reason as to why?<br />
<br />
<br />
also lol level gating content? is EVERYTHING &quot;time gated&quot; now? remember back in vanilla when the shitty fucking devs level gated raids? what fucking scum forcing people to pay months of sub just so they could raid!<br />
<br />
Your example doesn't work because for one thing, they didn't gate raids via level, they gated them via quest lines and attunement,<br />
which they eventually dropped due to how unpopular they were.<br />
<br />
Your example also doesn't work because you're comparing content that is always available vs. content that is exclusive to a holiday<br />
event that is around for at least 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
You should probably stop, you're not very good at this.<br />
<br />
There are only 2 big draws for these events, to get the meta achievement for the meta mount, OR to obtain the cosmetic<br />
items (toys and mounts) that are available. Some things you can get at any level (Xmas tree event), while others require<br />
players to be at a set level, the lowest being the level that begins the new expansion content and max level.<br />
<br />
So seeing as how most people are farming for those mounts &amp; toys, there's no good fucking reason to make it so that you<br />
have to be max level to get a mount drop, considering that you can enter this dungeon as low as level 15.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and with 10 chars per day you can still easily do 50 chars in 5 hours... or 100 chars in 10 hours... and that would mean having to make room.<br />
looks like you were caught not thinking, and now your trying to backtrack.<br />
the trason for this is to stop people spamming low levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.) Well. I didn't see how I was supposed to respond to that.<br />
2.) Yes, I think they saw knew it wouldn't be a finished product at release and a lot of the major systems would be controversial and planned accordingly. That or they just prepared for a standard expansion sub drop off after the first 1-2 months.<br />
3.) I don't remember them ever doing a &quot;these are going away foreverrr so buy them now&quot; sale IF it were just a sale that would be fine but creation some artificial scarcity and having a new store mount and having a holiday mount is just a lot for such a short time period.</div></div><hr />

If the WoW team is only, in Ion's words, &quot;around 180 people&quot; then the hots team was never that large in the first place. With them using the term &quot;hundreds&quot; of people being laid off, it's very likely that many people from EVERY franchise will be losing people.<br />
<br />
Hell yeah, fire them! they are the only ones who read the feedback! no one else does, the only thing they do is read stupid messy, I mean constructive feedback and laugh at it, fire them!!, Oh, all the other members of the team, you are doing allright, it's only the fault of those two, if we fire them it will all be fixed, revolution!!<br />

I mean, he's right though. When an allied race is released token prices skyrocket, when token prices skyrocket Blizzard is making money. People can say &quot;lol I'm spending gold for it&quot; but the reality is someone spent $20 on that token for you to get $15. The same thing applies too when a store mount or pet is released, the token prices skyrocket and this is fact with evidence in the history of token prices.<br />
<br />
I'm not that smart for this kind of stuff, and If i'm getting it wrong please correct me but blizzard can't make way more money with tokens now than they did without them, because the profit per 2 players in a monthly based subscription would be 2€ here in europe.<br />
<br />
Let's just think about the case where everyone buys tokens, one player doesn't pay but the other one pays 13€ + 15€ from the token + monthly subacription. Meaning 28€ instead of 26€.<br />
<br />
If we go that way generally speaking of course, blizzard has indeed made the subscription cost 1€ more.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm pretty sure that blizzard put tokens in the store and not all of them are from players who sold them, and if they do, they are certainly giving us &quot;money&quot; for &quot;free&quot;.<br />
<br />
I've yet to meet a wowplayer who has sold tokens for gold and I know quite a lot that buys tokens.<br />
<br />
So this means that if blizzard puts tokens then they are certainly not taking that much profit from this system, and those claims are just people who repeat what others said and don't stop to think about it even two seconds.<br />

blizzard is doing fine nothing to see here.<br />
<br />
Whats their newest project btw? Warcraft 3 and wow classic? <br />
<br />
Yeah nothing to see here, blizz is doing fine not needing to cash in on older classics rather than inventing new IPs<br />
<br />
I think if they have any new project they would certainly not announce it, first, they learned from titan, and second, having seen the hate of everything they do, they don't want to risk announcing anything they don't think it's solid enough to announce, and solid to announce ofc doesn't mean the game is finished and it's perfect, it means that they are now sure they are going to do it and can show us something solid, as they did with OW and it was perfect, from my point of view.<br />
<br />
No saying they are doing perfect or everything is perfect, stating facts. Also, a lot of companies with old IP's are remaking games since 2010 or before I think, blizzard, as always is coming late to the party and that's why it's like a flare in the middle of a clear sky on the night.</div></div><hr />

What twisted demented fucks you must be to see Blizzard go out of business and see many more hundreds of more people to lose their jobs. Wish for better not for the worst.<br />
<br />
People tend to forget all of the hard working devs and writers that have nothing to do with the BS the publishers and shareholders put out. Because when Blizzard does go out of business those scummy people get richer and are not affected at all and the real heroes of blizzard like the sound designers, the developers, and the creative writers get he short end. Those stockholders, those publishers, they don't mind, they'll get a massive cheque at the end.<br />
<br />
I want Blizzard to get better not go out of business and thats what we all should be encouraging from these companies.<br />
<br />
Go patch your bleeding heart elsewhere and stop talking like they provide some kind of charity and have not received billions of dollars and support over the years just to betray it all and fuck all the long time fans in the ass.</div></div><hr />

No you're wrong. Every token has to be purchased by a player first. This is common knowledge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true. ATVI stock took a 10% hit the other day just on revenue reporting from EA and Take-Two Interactive. 2019 looks to be a difficult year for gaming generally.<br />

Personally not expecting much of any news about WoW in the layoffs but anything can happen. I do expect that anyone associated with Destiny that is still employed by ATVI (marketing, support, social media) is going to be gone.</div></div><hr />

Firing Ion and Lore won't fix everything that is bad right now, and that you blame everything to them, as your hater ancestors with kaplan and ghost did, is wrong as hell. When blizzard fails at something at wow it fails as a team, blaming everything on Ion, and Lore (a community manager not even a developer like firing him would do something you are delusional) is stupid. Maybe if we fire Ion we could get someone who does better, but I won't risk it, not having this shitfest that it's happening with activision, I prefer having Ion that any other director that acti-bliz could put, the fact that all of you asking to fire him don't take that into account justifies the clames that you guys are on a hate train to shitshow island.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No you're wrong. Every token has to be purchased by a player first. This is common knowledge.<br />
<br />
Of course the token is purchased by a player first, then he sells it. Seems like you ignored, even if it had a lot of &quot;if's&quot; all of what I said about the margin profit from it from blizzard, and specially the part that they probably, if not 100% sure put tokens to fill what other players don't buy.</div></div><hr />

The reality is, as I said, as heads of the department they are responsible. This is how it works in ANY company. Since Ion has taken over he has done nothing good for the game, he's made changes to the game that the players have hated and resisted, he's told people to &quot;get over it&quot;, he's told people that he wants players to play a certain way, not the way they want to. I'm sorry, but this is an mmorpg, not a single player linear game. Ion and Josh are responsible for their departments failings, that's the bottom line.<br />

I agree with you, that at the bottom line, it's their fault, because they are the heads of their respective departments as you said, but the part about &quot;he's told people that he wants players to play a certain way, not the way they want to&quot; I can't see anything wrong with that, that ofc will make people flee, as has happened with BFA, but at the same time is not wrong if they want you to play the game how they designed it, if they change that or not is their problem, I'll stop playing as soon as I don't have fun anymore, as I have done with every other expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;If's&quot; in examples such as every player pays the subscription with a token from in-game gold. Please tell me how it works so we can have a middle ground to discuss, you are just saying &quot;this is not how it works&quot; and nothing more, as far as I know 1 person buys a token with real life money and another buys it with in-game gold.</div></div><hr />

WoW didn't become successful because the developers pushed you into playing the game a certain way. WoW is failing because the developers are forcing you to play a certain way.<br />

Your exact words were:<br />

<br />
You're &quot;pretty sure&quot; Blizzard puts tokens in the AH, they do not. Players have to buy the tokens, post them, then other players have to buy them. This is exactly how the system works, and we know this because there have been several times where there are zero tokens available for purchase with gold. So no, you're attempting to go back on what you claimed you were &quot;sure of&quot; by saying &quot;if if if&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was pretty sure they put tokens artificially as a way to say &quot;look how alive this is&quot;, but I didn't know there were times with no tokens avaliable so I stand corrected in everything, one learns something everyday, thanks!.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right, and every single player in the playerbase (or half the playerbase even) has the time to :<br />
1. Use all the characters they have that are eligible to do it normally (This varies as well as how long ques are)<br />
2. Make a new character<br />
3. Level that character to 15<br />
4. Que for the dungeon<br />
5. Do it, most likely doesnt get the mount<br />
6. Delete character and create new one<br />
7. Repeat Steps 2-6<br />
8. Play around the dungeon lock outs<br />
<br />
You realize how much of a massive waste of time and how completely ineffective this &quot;strategy&quot; would be?<br />
<br />
Of course you don't. And its obvious because you think the level restriction is to &quot;stop people spamming at low levels.&quot;<br />
<br />
You're clearly not mentally competent enough to keep up with this, may I suggest bowing out now to save what little<br />
face you have left (which is none)?</div></div><hr />
