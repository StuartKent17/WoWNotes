Almost all of the things he worked on at Blizzard were scrapped or while he was working on them were at a low point. Not that all of that falls on him. When you are in the roles he has been though part of your job is stopping others failures. There is a reason why after leaving the Diablo team he stepped out of a leadership role. Being good at one job doesn't make you good at the job above it, Blizzard relearned this with him.</div></div><hr />

For the big majority, his initiatives especially in Diablo 3 ended up being horrible mistakes. But what people don't get is, this man was brave and courageous enough to take those revolutionary steps. They might not have worked, but it is because of him that Blizzard now knows what NOT TO DO both in Diablo III and WoW and its future games. He literally showed the way to Blizzard with his doings. I'd take off my hat in respect to those who even laid a single brick in Blizzard's structure.</div></div><hr />

Chief executive of fuck it all up.<br />
without him involved, I am hoping that Blizzard can start to regain some sort of the old design philosophy that they have lost in their games in a the last few years.</div></div><hr />

I don't get why this was ever so funny? I mean, why was his post picked out of all those? Do you see what others after him said? Including the woman that wants to like his post more than once...<br />

They're all as bad as him. They just didn't go so far as &quot;Fuck that loser&quot;.<br />
<br />
I also find it pretty funny that you think calling someone out on their bullshit is &quot;petty&quot; but responding to legitimate criticism with &quot;Fuck that loser&quot; is appropriate enough to not be called out on it.</div></div><hr />

Apparently solely responsible for making D3 crap the whole scapegoat thing that GC got and Holinka gets with WoW. Apparently he made WoD suck and he insulted 1 dev and apologized after yet people still brought it up. You know like TB and the &quot;get cancer&quot; comment.</div></div><hr />

When Jay Wilson spoke of that game, he often commented on those successful attributes. That was his passion and he delivered on those parts. Second, he tried to direct the creation of an Online RPG in an era of MMORPG. Maybe Blizzard needed to step it up and go MMO, or at least change the scope and focus on the overall game. That's another subject.<br />
<br />
When it comes to WoW, many of the Diablo-like aspects of Legion are spoke of in positive ways. And if Legion is in anyway better than Warlords, what do you think we should attribute that to? Maybe, in part, the guy who just walked out the building.</div></div><hr />

Don't know where you got this idea from. At no point have I said he shouldn't be called out on it. But, to still cling to it now, and only his comment, is like holding some childish grudge. For a person none of them even know, personally.<br />
<br />
It was years ago. People need to learn to move on and be adults.<br />
<br />
Anyway, not wasting any more time on it. It's just MMO-C being MMO-C.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm confused what you're trying to argue here. GC jumped ship at the end of WoD's development. A lot of people said he saw how shit WoD was and wanted out. Looking back at the turd of WoD it would appear that was the case and he made the right decision.</div></div><hr />

Well a lot of people have been wondering why people aren't being shitcanned after what went on with WoD. Having 60% of your customers walk out the door costing you hundreds of millions of dollars is a pretty big deal. Maybe they're trying for a detox and a fresh start. But then I look at facebook integration and realize nah, they're just idiots. Nothing will change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or you know Titan was cancelled because they didn't find it feasible maintaining 2 mmos? Also if you really think he alone was responsible for WoD then that tinfoil hat must be glued to your damn head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the realm of reality (where most of us live), gaming decisions were made by a team of people . The decisions were then sent to the higher-ups to veto or approve. <br />
So if you want to believe that one man leaving is cause for celebration, then you go right ahead.<br />

Well, imagine that you are a very creative person, and you go to work for a company, and it's a great job, and you work there for ten years, but the whole time you're there, you're only working on other people's ideas.<br />
<br />
That's why Micky Nielson left. He wants to write his own stories, not just Warcraft and Starcraft stories.<br />

Presumably Jay Wilson is in a similar boat, as he says he wants to pursue writing.</div></div><hr />

Diablo III. Many people attribute a lot of the faults the game at had with launch with decisions he made, and he certainly took responsiblity for them. He was moved from the D3 team to the WoW team and worked on Warlords of Draenor after that.<br />
<br />
Of course, in the time since he left D3 that game has dramatically improved, while WoW has declined. So a lot of people will naturally see him as the common factor negatively impacting both games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not why it was cancelled. The alter ego gameplay was fun (overwatch) but the day to day regular person gameplay wasn't fun. Where you have a job and a family and all that. They tried to make it work and couldn't so they scrapped it and kept the overwatch crap.</div></div><hr />

The expansions are worked on years in advance. He was there at Blizzcon announcing it, looking very unthrilled to be there. He saw the shitshow and left. By the time it gets to alpha it's done, it's just being rolled out and tested at that point with some tweaking.</div></div><hr />

Being a useless game designer doesn't necessarily make him a bad guy. I can't judge him, because I've never met him. He was just in the wrong racket for a decade, and is now moving onto something that he seems to care about.<br />

<br />
That's because he was directly responsible for almost every bad part of D3. The only bad thing from D3 that wasn't his fault or his teams fault was the shitty launch and login fiasco. He is also one of the guys who has been causing the stagnation and shitty dev attitude from the WoW team. He should have been fired after screwing up Diablo so severely.<br />
<br />
Now all we gotta do is get rid of Celestalon and get some decent team leads in their positions. Then I would have very little to complain about with Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Yup. He was game director(I think) for vanilla D3, and insisted for a long time that the game's poor reception was our fault. Some famous quotes from him are &quot;Fuck that loser&quot; when referring to someone from D2, and &quot;Shut up PvP guy.&quot;</div></div><hr />

In half a year people are going to complain how much of a time vampire Legion is, with all the time and grind gated things.<br />
<br />
All in all, I'm glad that atleast some failed designers are getting sorted out at Blizzard. People like Celestalon and Craig Amai (Lead Class Designer) have to follow.<br />
<br />
I can agree for celes-&quot;most of you probably had no clue that you were a little overpowered, and that's fine.&quot;-talon. <br />

He meant Chris Zierhut as lead class designer and, yes, he needs to go. Classes, from what I'm hearing, have never been in worse shape approaching an expansion launch.</div></div><hr />

Oh, then he should definitely go. Questing has been in shabby shape since Cataclysm. Too much on-rails, too few interesting side stories, and less and less quests per zone on an overall basis. People might've liked WoD's questing the first time through, but running alts through Draenor quickly became unbearably tedious.</div></div><hr />

The concept of the weakest link in the chain, weakens the entire chain could apply as well. Personally, having worked with groups/workshops/think-tanks, it rarely becomes the case.

<br />
Wilson is a grade-A douchebag IMO, but consider that Blizz hired him, then promoted him and kept him on for so long. Obviously his brand of asshattery is just what they wanted, and served them well profit-wise as did others of similar ilk. But that's tapped out now and people have left Blizz in droves, so Wilson's usefulness is probably at it's nadir. Whatever influence he had on Legion is mostly already baked in, so you can thank him partly for that too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People shitpost 24/7 on MMO-C? No-one bats an eye...<br />
<br />
It's not &quot;when people rack down..&quot; It was someone from the Diablo 2 dev team who had some concerns about the game. He was not one of those vocal &quot;OH MY GOD THIS GAME SUCKSSSSSSSS&quot; people, it was someone he used to work with. Someone who worked on that game (according to you) he was trying to live up to the legacy of. The comments the D2 guy made were not even REMOTELY bad. It would take a lot of effort to make the guy's comments seem like a dig at D3. But Jay with his thin skin said 'fuck that loser' when he saw the remarks.<br />
<br />
No, Jay does not deserve sympathy for that. It's one thing to say it to some random gamers who are bitching about something. It's another thing to say it about a former developer. A former developer that a LOT of fans regard as the &quot;Godfather of Diablo.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please tell me the things D3 got right that he was responsible for? Keeping in mind he had nothing to do with the patches that came after launch.<br />
<br />
Core systems like the combat, skills and runes. Dunno if he had anything to do with Monster Power but once that was in place the game was pretty much perfect for me so if people are going to blame him for whatever gripes they have, I'll give him credit for what I consider to be a really enjoyable gaming experience.<br />

Well i would be more &quot;over partes&quot; but hell he nearly killed the Diablo franchise with the AH nonsense and empty promises like PvP. Maybe it was not his field and/or type of game. <br />
<br />
Still hope the best for him.<br />
<br />
Wasn't the PvP promise something along the lines of &quot;shut up PvP guy?&quot;<br />

2016 - ??? - story writer<br />
2006 - 2016 - Blizzard Entertainment<br />
2006 - Company of Heroes - Senior Designer<br />
2004 - Warhammer 40k Dawn of War - Design and Story<br />
2003 - Homeworld 2 - Additional Design Support<br />
2003 - Impossible Creatures - Lead Designer and Story<br />
1998 - King's Quest: Mask of Eternity - Quality Assurance<br />
1998 - Blood II: The Chosen - Game Concept and Lead Designer<br />
<br />
Remember Diablo 3 at launch? According to him it was &quot;perfectly executed&quot;... that's why they did not need to have major changes after the launch... oh wait.</div></div><hr />

He probably got a nicer severance package than I'll ever see.<br />

<br />
The grinds pale in comparison to what you're thinking. There's nothing wrong with Titanforged. Oh good, you get a chance at getting a higher item level item than you previously thought. Such shit, right? Artifact traits not all being given away immediately so people can bitch about less things to do? Please, go on. Continue further with your senseless argument.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that Artifacts can be completely filled out quicker if you wish to grind for it. The only thing that's gated is the rate at which you acquire AP. You can acquire it at the standard rate as much as you bloody well want to by spamming literally every kind of content that exists. You get AP from pretty much anything you can do in the game.</div></div><hr />

They are not leaving on their own, they all got fired. Or well &quot;contract didnt get extended&quot;, &quot;you can leave before we fire you&quot;, political correctnes bullshit.</div></div><hr />

To &quot;one person didnt ruin D3 etc...&quot; actually the lead designer can easily ruin the game. Its nice using phrases like &quot;team decision&quot; but at the end of the day its the lead designer who shows the course and has the first and final word in everything! There is very little democracy in business. As lead designer he was responsible for the right course of development so even if it was team decision it still is his fault. I usualy dont agree with stuff like &quot;Good ridance&quot;, but its good ridance here...<br />
<br />
To &quot;sinking ship&quot; - Blizzard isnt sinking ship! Sure it had bad days with WoD and D3 vanilla and probably SC2 pro-scene, but it looks like these days are over and Blizzard is going ahead strong again. (Personaly I dont like the course, because HS, OW arent games for me. And I dont have time for WoW and dont what to think about Legion right now...) Blizzard is on the scene for more than 20 years, and its only logical that lots of higher standing people are leaving it. Blizzard doesnt have high management job for everyone... When you cant get what you want in one company you will find another that needs you. This is the case of Ghostcrawler. Riot is still lacking in experienced leadership and was able to give him the position he wanted.<br />
<br />
As for WarCraft movie it seems success. It cost 160million and as far as I know it wasnt meant to be main season blockbuster. (bad news/good news post from last year where they announced that release date was postponed but it was put into main season) I havent seen it yet, but from trailers I dont like the realistic acting, cartoony WarCraft hybrid. Id rather see it being either more cartoony or more realistic. But that might be just the budget... How much is 160millions for 2 hour film? LotR 1 was estimated for 93mil 15 years ago (calculated for inflation it would be 125mil today). Hateful-eight got 60mil budget but it didnt need the insane CGI. Avatar 230mil,</div></div><hr />

Is that from the bullshit rating on rotten tomatoes, the same site that gave indiana jones and kingdom of the crystal skull a 77% rating and Justin Bieber: Never Say Never a 66%? Yeah I'm sure they have the best people casting solid ratings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember when Ghostcrawler left and classes didn't get better? Oh right they put an even more clueless idiot in charge.<br />
<br />
Glad he's finally off the team, but mad he plays it off like &quot;I did no wrong!&quot;.<br />
<br />
*EDIT* Apparently the Facebook Co-op is being hidden under this as well, just like how Obama passed gay marriage while TPP got fast-tracked. Typical political switch-a-roo.<br />

This cracked me up because it reminds me of one of those senile, paranoia-induced old person posts that you see on AOL political articles in the comment section. Mainly because it somehow got political in a gaming thread. Weird.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Fck that loser!&quot; When the Diablo 2 guy questioned Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
Yes, Jay Wilson was had a few obvious deficiencies.<br />
<br />
Then they nearly doubled all NPC damage.. so useless. Should have just reduced PVP damage to begin with.</div></div><hr />
