As we discussed in our previous announcement (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=24401796793), we're refining the currency systems used for purchasing PvE and PvP items in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, and the transition to this new system will take place in two stages. Today, we're going into more detail on how these changes will be rolled out, so if you haven't yet, make sure to check out the prior article to get up to speed on the currency names.<br />
<br />
One change of note since that original announcement is that we've changed the name of the low-tier PvE currency from Hero Points to Justice Points. The original announcement post has been updated to reflect this.<br />
<br />
Out With the Old<br />
<br />
In the upcoming 4.0 patch we'll begin the first stage of the conversion to the new currencies. Emblems of Triumph and Emblems of Frost will be converted into Justice Points. For this initial conversion there will be a soft cap of points you can have, with a hard cap enforced later as detailed below. All PvE emblems and badges below Frost and Triumph will be converted into gold. This even includes legacy badges, like Badges of Justice. If any of these older currencies are converted into gold, the player will receive it through an in-game letter.<br />
<br />
At this time any bosses a player defeats that are level-appropriate to them (and previously awarded badges or emblems upon defeat) will award them with the new Justice Points. Similarly, any items that previously cost emblems or badges of any type will now cost Justice Points instead.<br />
<br />
On the PvP side, Season 8 will end with the release of patch 4.0, and all Arena Points, Honor Points, any leftover Battleground Marks of Honor, Stone Keeper's Shards, Venture Coins, and Spirit Shards will be converted into the new Honor Points. The new Honor Point pool will also have a soft cap for these conversions, but a hard cap will be enforced later. At the time of conversion, items that previously cost Honor or Arena Points will be sold in exchange for the new Honor Points. Rated Arenas and Rated Battlegrounds won't be available again until Season 9 (shortly after the release of Cataclysm), when they can be entered to win the higher-tier PvP Conquest Points.<br />
<br />
In addition, purchasing any item with these secondary currencies (Honor Points and Justice Points) will now require that the purchaser meet the item's minimum level requirement.<br />
<br />
It's important to note that these conversions are not 1:1, but are indicative of the level and relative worth of each before the conversion to the new point systems. For example, Stone Keeper's Shards will convert into more Honor Points than Spirit Shards.<br />
<br />
Tip of the Cap<br />
<br />
While we previously announced that there's a limit to the amount of these new currencies you can stockpile, we're providing a grace period in the form of a soft cap. This soft cap will allow the initial conversion to push the amount owned over the cap, but will not allow any further points to be earned (or returned through item refunds) until enough points are spent to put you below the hard cap.<br />
<br />
For instance, a player has 3000 Emblems of Triumph, and 1200 Emblems of Frost; at the time of conversion they'll be given 4200 Justice Points. The hard cap for Justice Points is 4000, so that player won't be able to earn any more Justice Points until he or she spends enough points to reduce the total to under 4000. This also applies to the new PvP Honor Points, which also have a cap of 4000.<br />
<br />
Shortly before Cataclysm is released, another patch will enforce the hard cap, marking the second stage of the currency conversion. Any Justice or Honor Points above the hard cap will be converted to gold, and just like in the first stage of the conversion, the player will receive an in-game letter explaining that some of their currencies were converted into gold as well as delivering the gold itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually not quite. Justice Points are the WotLK Points.<br />
<br />
Come Cataclysm, at level 85, it will be Hero Points and Triumph Points. They won't let us stockpile points in advance to earn new PvE gear from the vendors right when we hit 85 (since you need to be of-level to buy them now).<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering what impact they will have to the BoJ stuff back in Shattrath and on Quel'Danas. I realize it's horribly out-dated, but myself and a few guildies are putting together themed outfits (more for fun and looks, so we can look different in Dalaran), so, are farming alot of BoJ right now (Doing Zul'Aman-based troll outfits). Or if this stuff will just become worth pure gold.</div></div><hr />

I guess there is a limit, wish I knew what that was, I would hate to store up 500 emblems or something and then the limit(once converted) worked out to be like 100.<br />

EDIT: I guess I should have read to the whole article to explain the soft cap. /facepalm</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it won't. They already explained, months ago, that PvE points will work much like how PvP does now.<br />
<br />
When a new tier of raiding launches, all current Triumph points will become Hero Points, and the raids that awarded Triumph points will only be the new content, not old content. Daily Random Heroic will still award Triumph points, for the first of the day, much like how Frosts are awarded today.<br />
<br />
So, as an example: You got 15,000 Triumph Points from raiding Naxxramas. Ulduar is launched, and your 15,000 Triumph Points, just all turned into Hero Points. You got 0 Triumph Points, and can only earn them in Ulduar now. They will give us warning obviously, so we can spend em beforehand likely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does state in the post the cap is 4000....so how are we meant to buy gear if items cost 30,000??<br />
<br />
Chances are items will cost about the same amount of points(emblems) as they do now</div></div><hr />

I had roughly 20 BC badges and maybe 40 venture coins so me thinks you are better off farming triumph for gems before patch 4.0 hits and tons of people are looking to switch out their Blizzard enforced Armor Penetration switched gems.</div></div><hr />

This certainly looks like it. But if the example that was given is exactly as it'll be, and gear in cata cost like 1000+ points, it won't be that good, unless you've been saving emblems for weeks on end without spending them. Let's just wait until tomorrow for the conversion rates.</div></div><hr />

We likely won't even NEED notice. Why not? Because anything we could buy with Triumph points will shift over to being purchased with Hero points at the same time the currency shift happens. We can still buy it all even if we miss the date.</div></div><hr />

I have about 100 frost, and 90 triumph on live, and I didn't have enough justice points to buy anything from the vendors in Dalaran on PTR.<br />
<br />
Yep. I went to the vendors to purchase some heirlooms for one of my alts. On live I would have had more than enough badges to get a few pieces. On the PTR I had 240 or so Justice points. I couldn't purchase a single Heirloom item with that.<br />

So I guess buy up stuff you want now before they are converted.</div></div><hr />

&quot;One change of note since that original announcement is that we've changed the name of the low-tier PvE currency from Hero Points to Justice Points.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Justice Points -- Low-tier, easier-to-get PVE points. Maximum cap to how many you can own, but no cap to how quickly you can earn them. Earned from most dungeons. (most like the current Emblem of Triumph)<br />
Valor Points -- High-tier, harder-to-get PvE points. Maximum cap to how many you can own, as well as a cap to how many you can earn per week. Earned from Dungeon Finder daily Heroic and from raids. (most like the current Emblem of Frost)<br />

I dislike that. My alts all bought at least one piece of the 232 PVP gear pre-80 thanks to Call to Arms. Some managed 4. Now they're possibly gonna hit the cap because they can't spend it until 80.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of people are gonna go &quot;LAWLEZGEERNUB&quot;. But it's the most basic PVP gear, which most people use as their starter Heroic dungeon gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You already can. Frost emblems are quite handy. These changes will put frost and triumph badges on equal ground, but consider that we'll only have 2 weeks of farming before the expansion anyway, and you'll see why it doesn't matter. <br />
<br />
As for those asking if it'll be possible to save up for cata gear, you'll get justice points, not hero points, ie. It'll be rewarding 5-man loot, rather than raid gear. So, a slight advantage, but probably nothing that 5 minutes on the auction house, LFD tool or trade chat won't solve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My #1 question is what currency will we use to buy the current Badge of Justice gear? Gold or Justice Points? Gold means that people could get the gear really, really easily. Justice Points means that you could never get that gear at the appropriate level. I have a Shaman I've just started farming TBC heroics and this is an interesting change...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, they are doing this so that they can increase the power of that gear even easier.<br />
<br />
Anything below &quot;last tier&quot; will be completely phased out in Cata, including raid content.<br />

<br />
On a second part, they still have yet to answer the one question that EVERY serious PVP player has!<br />
<br />
Blizzard, what are you going to do about Wintergrasp Commendations?<br />
<br />
These can be used to grant 2000 honor to any toon you wish, and are BoA (if you did not know).<br />
<br />
I have a pretty active PVP server, and I have a stockpile of 243 of them! (cap is 250). At 2000 honor a pop I am sitting on almost 500,000 honor! I was planning to use this to get my main a nice starter set of PVP gear when Cat hits, as it has already been stated that the basic honor points will not be changing. <br />
<br />
Everything they have said talks about the tokens, but still nothing about the Wintergrasp Commendations!!!<br />
<br />
Just to be sure! I would HIGHLY recommend moving your stockpile to your main toon or the toon you were planning to use these on. I keep mine on my bank alt, and it would be a shame to have a level 1 with 500,000 honor :P<br />

Negative. Tbe conversion rate is pretty terrible. For example, on the PTR, with my warrior that I have played about 2000 instances on and raided since release with a crap ton of other currencies as well, I got about 800g from the low level currencies and a minimal amount of Justice points. I would actually recommend you spend any points you can before 4.01.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;For instance, a player has 3000 Emblems of Triumph, and 1200 Emblems of Frost; at the time of conversion they'll be given 4200 Justice Points. &quot;<br />

Sort of, similar to how triumph badges started dropping there when ICC came out. They'll be useful for about 2, maybe even 3 or 4 weeks, before being replaced by lvl80 greens.</div></div><hr />

If 1 Frost = 1 Justice Point i would be shocked if they raised the cost, but then again if 1 Triumph also = 1 Justice point I guess i could understand the price going up.</div></div><hr />

Nobody knows, so they're not answering you.<br />

As for costs of items, the (old frost) vendor items were all in the multi-hundreds of points. 400 or more, i think, for the 264 belt/cloak, if I remember correctly.<br />

I think the post says 1 triumph = 1 frost = 1 justice point. <br />
<br />
So the real question you need to ask is how many justice points = 1 T10 item.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spike`</div><div class="date">2010-09-14, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From Wow forums:<br />
<br />
&quot;Currently on the PTR items such as Tier 9 shoulders are costing 487 justice points, t10 pants are 1100 justice points.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are these numbers what they will be when 4.0 goes live? or are they perhaps bugged numbers from something aflop during the conversion?<br />
<br />
As it stands if 1 frost badges = 1 justice point, 1100 points for pants seems a tad outrageous, as currently it takes 405 frost badges (which would be 405 justice points in 4.0) to get ALL 5 pieces of t10.&quot;<br />
<br />
hmmm if that dont change you better off buying t10 with frost right now</div></div><hr />

Your tier10 gear will be replaced in the first level or 2 of the expansion, or even sooner if its 251.<br />

Right. You would be banking your Justice conversion points for a blue item. The blue item will still be an upgrade to the green that you got from questing. You had to do the same in Wrath before you overpowered all of the heroics.</div></div><hr />

I'm suspecting like Valor/Heroism badge vendors at the beginning of WotLK, there will be SOMETHING for purchase at 85 that will be on the same level of heroic dungeon rewards, or at the very least, higher than quest rewards. There has to be a reason to run the dungeons and heroics beyond the drops.<br />
<br />
It won't be Tier 11, of course, but it will be heroic dungeon level gear.</div></div><hr />

Yeah the conversion for the badges you have is 1 to 1. The vendors are now asking for more justice points than they did badges for the same items. So yes it would be to your advantage to purchase any heirloom gear/gems you want NOW rather than after 4.0 is rolled out.</div></div><hr />

Probably not anymore worth it than AoE farming old world dungeons for gold/vendor drops.<br />
<br />
I had something like 80 justice badges, and I don't know how many of the other, and only received about 30g. I don't think the conversion is overly generous, nor should it be since they are currencies nobody gave a damn about until now (read: it's absolutely nothing but a gain if they gave you 1g or 100g.

Given the costs of items in justice points, it really doesn't seem useful to farm triumph badges. Assuming a 1:1 conversion, and item costs in the 800 range, it'd take 200 random heroic full clears to buy one piece.</div></div><hr />

It is a bug. Heroics/raids are not currently giving Justice points, so it's uncertain as to whether they will only give the same amount of points as they did badges or if they'll give more as points seem to be &quot;worth&quot; less than badges.<br />
<br />
Honestly folks, if you consider it a hassle that you won't be able to afford the Frost gear once 4.0 hits, then you'll really be bitching at 85. That frost gear will mean nothing when 4.0 hits, because as anyone can tell from playing the PTR today, the DPS/healing/tanking numbers are totally screwy at level 80. Some people will have trouble pulling their weight in ICC in 277s while some will be be facerolling heroic in 232s. Healing will be a complete joke no matter what gear you're wearing, and...well I'm not gonna lie, tanks are gonna struggle no matter what gear they have on. New mechanics + old content = volatile mix, and worrying about gear that will be irrelevant when 4.0 rolls around is silly. Get what you want to get now, and don't worry about the rest, because it's not worth worrying about.</div></div><hr />

The transition to justice and valor points is no different than the current emblem system we're using now, it's just that this new system now will not change names from tier to tier. Whereas currently the Conquest emblem is for T8, Triumph is for T9, and Frost is for T10, they are basically changing it so that &quot;Valor Points == Current Tier&quot; and &quot;Justice Points == Previous Tier&quot;. When a new tier is released, they will most likely take all of your valor points and convert them into justice points. I'm not sure what they'll do with your current justice points at that time, but they can do one of two things....either buy out your current justice points, then move what valor you have to justice, and wipe your valor clean for the new tier OR just move what valor you have into justice up to the cap, buy you out the rest (or trash it), then wipe your valor for the new tier.<br />
<br />
Now, Blizzard obviously is not going to give you a ton of justice points to spend on T11 gear, that's what the valor points are for, and I'm guessing that at level 85 we'll see a similar system used to how we earn frost right now. I'm curious as to the need for the justice points at the beginning of a new expansion though, since there isn't really a viable previous tier for a new level 85 to buy. Plus, it doesn't make sense to let people buy way better level 85 gear with points you earned at level 80. That's bad for Blizzard's model of keeping people playing. If I were to guess, I'd say the justice points will simply be like our current Conquest emblems....useless.<br />
<br />
All in all, it's a better system and gets rid of the needless renaming of badges every tier release.</div></div><hr />

To make Justice point farming (almost) useless, they'll just make the Cata bosses award 10 or 100 or so points -- compared to WotlK bosses awarding 1-2 each.

Thanks! I was looking for some idea of scale. <br />
<br />
So this tells me the cost, what is the income. I know that 1200 EoF is a lot - 600 dailies, but had no idea if 1200 JPoints was a lot or a little.<br />
<br />
Currently, I can run VH 10 times to get a T9 gloves. So if I run VH 367 times to get 1101 triumph badges, that will get converted into 1101 JP to buy the L251 gear. Is that per piece?<br />
How many Justice points does the first boss drop? I.e., how many heroics do you need to run to get one piece of T11? <br />

It would be an unfair advantage for people to be able to go into Cataclysm with a stockpile of Justice points to be able to buy level 85 heroic-level gear.<br />
<br />
Chances are, gear cost will be a lot different with the use of points. This means that your 300 Justice Points probably won't even get you half a pair of bracers, whereas right now, that many emblems can net you four pieces of T8.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to see both the badge/emblem to gold conversion rate and the value of points.<br />

<br />
I can't find the thread covering this, so here's the short answer:<br />
<br />
As far as I can recall, most of the new 1-85 BoA gear is obtained from a guild. What is required to get those is the appropriate guild rank/rep, plus spending some gold (final numbers are not yet determined).</div></div><hr />

<br />
1100 badges could become 110 and be very reasonable<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Option 2,<br />
<br />
These are the new prices. It is a quick fix to prevent everyone from stockpiling points. Some will! Hey, to some, who may have 5000 points, wow gratz here are two new epics for you. Hope the 500 hours was worth it. <br />
<br />
If such is the case, numbers will scale on an appropriate level. Presume that hero points will be on par with current triumph badges.<br />
<br />
50 triumph badges = T9 Chest | 50 badges takes about 10 heroics to get<br />
1100 hero points = T11 Chest | 1100 / 10 = 110<br />
<br />
110 points per heroic. This would work out to say, 20 per boss, and 50 for the last boss.<br />
<br />
If you look at the number they are not crazy! They are actually very realistic. There is no advantage to farm now, and hope to have an edge later, but thats the way it has always been! All the Triumph badges in the world cannot buy you a single piece of T10!</div></div><hr />

You dont know, you can actually use shift-right click for purchasing more emblems at the time ? works similar to reagents buying, enter the number (100 for example) and your triumph will be converted to lower ones. You must do it few times (# of type converts) to actually reach heroism but still very faster then buying it with simply right-clicking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Come Cataclysm, at level 85, it will be Hero Points and Triumph Points. They won't let us stockpile points in advance to earn new PvE gear from the vendors right when we hit 85 (since you need to be of-level to buy them now).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is inaccurate. Read the news post more thoroughly next time. Better yet, I quoted it below for you.<br />
<br />
&quot;One change of note since that original announcement is that we've changed the name of the low-tier PvE currency from Hero Points to Justice Points. The original announcement post has been updated to reflect this.&quot;<br />

<br />
My guess is justice points will offer blue level 85 starter raid gear, while the next tier of points will offer first tier raid quality.<br />
<br />
When the 2nd tier of raids are released the first tier will be available with justice points and the 2nd tier will be available through tier 2 raids.<br />
<br />
This is what they had mentioned before.</div></div><hr />

Nope, you'll have 4000 points at 85 that you can only spend on lvl 80 gear.</div></div><hr />

I know it is just the PTR but the conversion is rough. You get one point per emblem. The 245 gear is 797 points and the 251 gear is 1100 point. If the PTR goes live, make sure you use the emblems before conversion<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As of now it is 1100<br />
<br />
Its because when 4.0 hits,you ll be able to farm those Justice Points in random dungeons,so thats why items are more expensive.</div></div><hr />

One wonders, do people actually read these days?<br />
<br />
All PvE emblems and badges below Frost and Triumph will be converted into gold. This even includes legacy badges, like Badges of Justice. If any of these older currencies are converted into gold, the player will receive it through an in-game letter.</div></div><hr />

so an emblem of heroism gives 5g50s and a badge of justice gives exactly 1/3 of that (489g41s10c / 267 = 1g83s3c)<br />

As far as I am aware, all of the old heirloom gear is going to be priced with the new emblems. Meaning, you will need to buy heirloom gear with the same currency you will probably be buying the new tiers with.<br />
<br />
In the end meaning it'll be a lot harder to buy the heirloom gear then than it is now.</div></div><hr />

My point still stands. Buy the gear *now* with the old emblems which are easy to come by before you need to spend some of the new Cataclysm emblems (which you will be using on tier games) on them.<br />
<br />
Now: x heirloom gear will cost y amount of Frost badges.<br />
Cata: x heirloom gear will cost y amount of Justice Points.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm, you'll be buying gear/tiers/upgrades with Justice Points. As it stands in WoTLK, you spend Frost etc on... gems. So, my point as I said, is to buy heirloom gear *now* so that you don't have to spend Justice Points in them in Cataclysm, as you'll need them for other things.</div></div><hr />

My bet is that once you reach lvl 85 all of your Justice points get reset, just like your honor points do. This is to make sure everyone has an equal start. With the added limit on what you can buy, to what you can actually use, this guarantees the start to be equal for all.

PVE<br />
- Emblems of triumph convert into justice points 1:1<br />
- The justice points can be used to buy badge gear (doesn't matter what type)<br />

- Honor points and other alike currencies will be changed into Honor Points (:o)<br />

In Cataclysm, you'll be buying gear/tiers/upgrades with Justice Points. As it stands in WoTLK, you spend Frost etc on... gems. So, my point as I said, is to buy heirloom gear *now* so that you don't have to spend Justice Points in them in Cataclysm, as you'll need them for other things.<br />
<br />
You're not going to buy Cataclysm Tier gear with Justice points. Valor points will be the currency for raid (tier) level gear.<br />
<br />
Right now, blizzard is alread downgrading Emblem of Frost Value to Triumph level, think about it as if we got a new raid tier and frost became the current low level drop, but we don't have a way to get the new raid tier gear and emblems until raiding at level 85.<br />
<br />
If they don't wipe the new justice/honor points (I think they'll, just like current arena point system, since this new system makes emblems/honor work like arena points wich they don't want us to farm to buy new &quot;top&quot; gear right at day 1 of a new expansion or raid patch), they are probably setting the current &quot;max&quot; points very low compared to what it will be when Cata launches, so people won't be able to store that many points needed to buy lvl 85 cataclysm heroic level gear/heroic pvp gear (not raiding gear and rated bg/arena gear).<br />
<br />
Also you'll only be able to buy lvl 85 gear AT lvl 85, so if the max cap remains the same, we'll probably end wasting tons of Justice points because we reached the max cap until we are lvl 85 and meet the criteria to buy it.</div></div><hr />

My #1 question is what currency will we use to buy the current Badge of Justice gear? Gold or Justice Points? Gold means that people could get the gear really, really easily. Justice Points means that you could never get that gear at the appropriate level. I have a Shaman I've just started farming TBC heroics and this is an interesting change...<br />
<br />
Because when 4.0 drops it will, for all intents and purposes, be the next tier of content. Technically Cataclysm will follow the patch by a few weeks, but most people aren't going to spend &quot;Justice Points&quot; on Frost gear when they can save them and get base line Cataclysm Epics with them in a few weeks. From the sounds of things, we will A) get more points per run in Cataclysm, and B) pay a lot more point per item; but a head start is a head start. Yes, you could theoretically use the change to face roll getting a lot of T-10 level gear at the very end of Wrath, but then you'd just replace it all in the early Cataclysm quests, essentially &quot;wasting&quot; those points.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it, because the wrathful is the top arena gear and it will stil be till the season 9 starts. You will be able to buy full wrathful with the new honor points once the season 9 starts and better gear (lvl85) is issued.<br />

You're mixing things up, 4.0.3 will be the Cata patch, while 4.0.1 is the preparation patch.</div></div><hr />

Yeh, 2 weeks away at least, since it's arena season end, so there'll probably be an announcement (blue sticky post) about that on the official PvP forums. <br />
But consider this - there's 2 pre-patches this time, and only 4 Wednesdays for them to go live in October. (Assuming they ARE patching on Wednesdays, as with every patch ever!) <br />
Oh... and I doubt it'll be 4.1 on release day. It'll be 4.0.3, or 4.0.4, or something. Note that we're still on 3.3.5 now - they don't increase numbers that quickly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2010-09-15, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now, Blizzard obviously is not going to give you a ton of justice points to spend on T11 gear, that's what the valor points are for, and I'm guessing that at level 85 we'll see a similar system used to how we earn frost right now. I'm curious as to the need for the justice points at the beginning of a new expansion though, since there isn't really a viable previous tier for a new level 85 to buy. Plus, it doesn't make sense to let people buy way better level 85 gear with points you earned at level 80. That's bad for Blizzard's model of keeping people playing. If I were to guess, I'd say the justice points will simply be like our current Conquest emblems....useless.<br />
<br />
At a guess they'll be like Emblems of Heroism were at the beginning of Wrath. Useful to buy your starter raid set (not Tier which will be bought with the Valor Points or maybe dropped, but the starter Epics and/or Rares that you will use when you first enter the early raids.) Most likely starter raid sets will be made from a combination of Heroic 5 man drops, Justice Point gear, Rep gear, and crafted gear.<br />

Nothing you do before lvl85 can have any affect on what you can do at lvl85. It is nothing they have done before, just look at what have been done with arena/honor points going from 70 to 80. My bet is that once you reach lvl 85 all of your Justice points get reset, just like your honor points do. This is to make sure everyone has an equal start. With the added limit on what you can buy, to what you can actually use, this guarantees the start to be equal for all. But please try to outsmart GC, and get a headstart by stockpiling worthless crap. The only thing that will carry over is gold.<br />
<br />
Doubt it. There's precedent here. Currently Random Regular Dungeons earn two Badges of Triumph for the first one of the day, and many people have enough badges to buy a tier piece or two as soon as they hit 80. This will be the same. Indications are that the &quot;value&quot; of Justice Points relative to the cost of items is much higher than current badge prices. So if you get a couple hundred Justice Points from your current badges, it's just a small head start on getting your 85 starter raid set when you hit max level. Even people with a thousand or more badges won't be getting more than a piece or two, so it's not a huge bonus, just a little help getting you started.</div></div><hr />

Specifically, I'm currently farming badges for BoA gear for my shammy to help push through to 80 a little quicker plus they're better than anything that is dropping for me in the dungeons. Are BoA's going to be gold since that's what their tier of badges converts to or is everything justice points?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seventhsin</div><div class="date">2010-09-17, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes once 4.0.1 hits all the gear from the current Frost emblems and lower will be bought with Justice Points. The conversion rate does seem ridiculous but people aren't taking into consideration how many points you will be getting per daily heroic and assuming you still get 2 points per. The only reason to stockpile the emblems at this moment is you are still going after some T10 gear or BOA items for alts as it does give you a little help in JP. As far as saving them for future Epic gear for lvl 85, this is pointless as in a previous blue post it was stated that once higher gear is implemented all the current JP you have at that moment converts to gold and everyone starts off with a clean slate.</div></div><hr />

Well of course the amount of honor from a commendation will change as well, but yes, it is still unknown whether these items will continue to exist, or if they are converted as well.</div></div><hr />
