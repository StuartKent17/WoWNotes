That just means the mats will rise in price. So, either farm the mats and resell for pure profit or stock up now while it's still cheap.<br />

<br />
Only holy paladins don't have the best prehealing in the game, which is half of top-tier pvp. (Priests shield, druids hot, shamans earth shield, paladins...????) They eat a CC chain, it's basically over. Also this is a nerf in the fact that denounce no longer makes exorcism instant, so you'd have to be dumb enough to let the paladin stand there and cast it on you without interrupting him. If you interrupt his exorcism, you lock his holy tree and he can't heal. If he's standing there casting exorcism he's not exactly healing either, so with the fact that they have no prehealing, doing something like this would be bad for a holy paladin as it puts them behind in healing. So I'm not exactly sure how anyone can see this as a buff. In pve there's no real chance of a tank being crit...so this is some poor attempt at pvp balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overall, it's something like a 3.5% nerf to overall damage resistance for Prot Paladins.<br />
<br />
It's a slight nerf, but the people crying over it don't understand the implications, because they're bad tanks and think only of the number, not of the mechanic.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's a nerf, no it's not crippling. What's REALLY important about it, just as you say with your unhittable remark, is that it increases the CONSISTENCY of your tanking abilities, not the POTENCY.<br />
<br />
Before, blocking was incredibly useful at reducing your damage, but you had a low chance of doing it, so more heals were likely to be wasted because your healers couldn't be sure if you were going to block or not. Now, fewer heals get wasted because it's more predictable. I would be willing to bet the 3.5% loss in overall potency still nets you better overall tanking efficiency because it spares healers more mana than the 3.5% overall damage reduction does.<br />
<br />
Also, I like the denounce change. I think the idea is that Aura Mastery + Denounce is the intended use. Now you have to choose how to use your stuff, it can be used to prevent the enemy from burning your team down, defensively, or it can be used to prevent the enemy team from healing themselves so well, so it's offensive.<br />
<br />
This is particularly dangerous against Shamans, who rely on a LOT of critical effects to support their net healing AND their ability to KEEP healing late into fights.<br />
<br />
Don't think just of crits, think of all the stuff that crits activate and support. This is a huge boon to Healing Paladin's versatility. The payoff is that you have to be smart enough to use it when you wont get interrupted, you can force it via Aura Mastery or you can just use it when their interrupts are on CD, or when you're not being targeted. It's a pretty short cast, I think you stand a pretty good chance of getting it off when their team is on the defensive. The sky isn't falling.</div></div><hr />

*facepalm* that is a buff. Currently the mana gem proc lasts 10 seconds, they are buffing it to 15 seconds. Since you mentioned PvE i assume you think it's a nerf. If not, then once again all I can say to your qq is *facepalm*.</div></div><hr />

This is all being balanced around PvP and I really sodding hate it. They're able to balance PvP(and E) abilities (note: warriors armor removal). Why not do the same for buffs and debuffs of all classes? That way there'd be no need for these silly changes that affect PvE on a monstrous scale. (not just talking about this one change, that'd be very dramatic)<br />
<br />
Yes, Feral Druids are strong in PvP, but you know what? So's a bloody warrior/rogue/frost mage/DK. You just *notice* it more when you're killed by a cat, whine, get us nerfed. It's so easy to CC a cat. Problem is, the voice of the feral community is about as loud as a woman's fart (note: that's very quiet, unless you picked a winner).<br />

Do you remember at the start of the expansion when Holy Shield was the 4.2 version BUT was 15% instead of 5%? I do. Then they changed it because they said it was too easy for us to get unhittable. Unlike Warriors, we have no mechanic to not waste additional block, so giving us MORE block again is dumb.<br />

But anyway. It's a nerf. And unlike the WoG CD change, it's unneeded. Why are they fixing shit that wasn't broken?</div></div><hr />

The flat strength buff to unholy is nice though. The thing is, obliterate is almost exclusively a frost PvE ability.

This would indicate that Blizzard feels that Frost PvE DPS is too high and that is objectively false according to all evidence.</div></div><hr />

Currently the mana gem proc lasts 10 seconds, they are buffing it to 15 seconds. Since you mentioned PvE i assume you think it's a nerf. If not, then once again all I can say to your qq is *facepalm*.<br />
<br />
Hmm not sure if this has been pointed out already and I missed the post but in fact this is not a buff it's a tooltip correction. The buff from Mana gem has lasted 15s since it was introduced in 4.01. It was logical in the first place to make it 15s since it was intended to be used at the same time as AP which also has a 15s duration.<br />
<br />
Don't be too surprised to see some other Arcane nerfs and buffs over the coming weeks that are also just tooltip corrections.<br />
<br />
For example the damage bonus from Invocation has been 7/12% since 4.01 not 5/10% as stated in the tooltip.<br />
<br />
Invocation itself may be further rephrased along the following lines to become &quot;You gain a 7/12% damage bonus for 8s after successfully interrupting a spell using Counterspell&quot;. Since 4.01 the proc has only occurred when the interruption has be caused by Counterspell even if it is an interrupt that causes a school lockout such as with the Engineers' Bolt Gun and not an Interruption caused by a stun or other mechanism which some people claim aren't interruptions even if Cast display says &quot;interrupted&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The changes to our Improved Water Shield talent (now Resurgence) seems to be 100% chance to regain a predetermined amount of mana depending on what direct healing spell you crit with. This is different than the current set up which has an individual percentage chance for each spell you crit with and only gives you mana equal to however much your water shield gives.<br />
<br />
The only thing changing in 4.2 aside from our a foreseeable mana tide nerf is we're now going to value crit more than we currently do (crit is currently at the bottom of the totem pole once you reach heroic mode raiding). Aslong as you have a healthy amount of crit while not ignoring other stats I don't see any problem at 85.</div></div><hr />

Then the reward for having 150 pets would really *feel* like a reward. I know a mechanical squirrel isn't the same as what I imagine will be a normal squirrel, but... /shrug<br />
<br />
Between throwing a new name on what used to be a very rare pet and calling it new to sell for Japan relief and this, I'm feeling a bit bummed. *Note that I think Blizz giving us the opportunity to help Japan's relief efforts is awesome, I'm not an a$$hole. I was just a bit upset that they literally switched out the name and id of a rare TGC pet and put it on the store. Imagine if everyone could suddenly get an identical renamed swift spectral tiger (worth ~$800), the Murky pet (worth ~$2000), Ashes of A'lar or a legendary weapon from the Blizz store... people would lose it.*<br />
<br />
No, aquiring 150 pets doesn't really equate with earning a legendary or a heroic achievements mount. But it still takes a lot of time, effort, gold and often real life money (old collector's editions etc). I know Blizz has bigger things to worry about, but imo: if you're going to do it, do it right. I'd rather have nothing than feel slighted by what was obviously a 30 second decision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a Holy pally is spamming exorcism in a raid on a boss to keep Denouncement up on the boss (assuming it would work), that's a holy pally that isn't healing their group. And DPS classes don't gem/enchant/reforge/gear into the avoidance that tanks have, nor the health to take the blows, either, so I don't see too many instances where you would want to do that sort of thing, myself.<br />
<br />
And so many prot pallies complaining... jeez... I gotta wonder why I bother reading these things. They are acting like the change is final and throwing in the towel. Perhaps they should actually get on the PTR, do some testing, and then provide feedback to Blizzard. If they find the change is too much of a nerf, provide intelligent feedback to Blizzard. Give enough proof that it's a change in the wrong direction, and they have been proven to listen to players in the past.</div></div><hr />

It would devalue mastery below dodge and parry up until both avoidance stats met with very high diminishing returns, making block cap unlikely; so the extra +5% chance to block would be rather pitiful. Unless they actually change our mastery as well perhaps so that mastery both increases block chance and block ammount, similar to warrior mastery but more stable so that excess mastery is not wasted (currently symbiotic worm is worthless to me since the proc is wasted, while on a prot warrior even with shield block up it still finds use.) I cannot see this change as anything other than a nerf, and that I do not understand. The mitigation of all tanks is roughly equal, we have much less self-healing than DKs now and we still have crappy mobility compared to warriors and druids.</div></div><hr />

Now you activate Frenzied Regeneration rank2. Now you have 130,000 max hp and that would leave you at ~7,7% of your max hp.

Back a few months ago when I quit WoW it was one nerf too many that was the straw for me. I had played my lock since vanilla and endured countless lock nerfs during those years but one night back in February I just had it with totally unmotivated lock nerfs (and other issues too in cata) and quit. They rarely give any reasons behind them either it's just bam and you are nerfed and often they nerf things that makes no sense whatsoever. Sure I have lots of alts but when you are a lock by heart then that's what you want to play.<br />
<br />
Seems like they need another 600k people quitting to get the message that people have had it with the those kind of nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you trolling? This system has been known for almost a year. Every tier VP gets converted to JP, and the gear (tier 11 in this case) also gets bumped down to be purchaseable with JP. It basically amounts to EXACTLY what happened in Wotlk, except you don´t have to deal with so many different curriences. VP will always come from raids and from daily heroics and will always purchase the latest tier.. JP will always come from heroic bosses and will buy the 2nd highest teir. Think it through, it is exactly like wotlk, except in a year, we won´t have 4 useless currencies lingering around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand the change, Shadowbolt spec makes multi-dot soul swapping much easier to keep up shadow embrace stacks.. The released 4-piece also makes this necessary, although i did enjoy it while it lasted. Blizzard clearly was going in a direction with affliction to be drain spec, evident in the LAST PATCH! Now they suddenly change directions?<br />
<br />
BUTTTTT<br />
<br />
They seriously need to change nightfall to include a different spell other than drain life.. maybe Drain soul (would be better then drain life for sure yet not practical while trying to execute) or maybe a different DoT.<br />
<br />
I guess i just don't get it. Like someone said earler on this thread, my class has recieved nothing but nerfs for years, being crapped on by hybrid classes is aweful. We recieved a flat 12% nerf across the board when cata released.. wasn't that enough? When the hell will we ever get buffed? Do ANNNYYYY game designers/creators play a freaking warlock? We might as well be considered a hybrid class with the way we are constantly and consistantly nerfed and kept in check.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing changing in 4.2 aside from our a foreseeable mana tide nerf is we're now going to value crit more than we currently do (crit is currently at the bottom of the totem pole once you reach heroic mode raiding). Aslong as you have a healthy amount of crit while not ignoring other stats I don't see any problem at 85.<br />

ETA; 70 x 7 = 490, + 140 x 7 for the troll heroics, that's a total of 1470 VP weekly, unless that was changed.<br />
<br />
Uhh? The VP cap is 1250 a week. You can do only 7 dungeons worth VP, so the MAXIMUM you can get outside of raids is 980. To hit the 1250 cap each week you'd have to raid and down 4 bosses on top of the 7 troll dungeons.<br />
<br />
If you do 7 normal heroics, then the maximum you'll get is 490 VP. You can't stack them with 7 troll dungeons.<br />
<br />
As a side note, the VP cap has always been 1250 since they were introduced. I'm not even sure where you got 1470 from.</div></div><hr />

Were Shadow Priests *that* OP that they needed a nerf?<br />
<br />
no clue, atm what ive seen from SP is that they arnt even close to mages or locks in dps and still get nerfed, sure they increase the direct dmg spells but still dont see the point or a valid reason to nerf the dots for SP, if there is something they should do is to lower the mana costs for some of the spells since i notice in hc's quite alot seem to have mana issues wile other caster dps classes isnt even close to run out of mana.<br />

<br />
eeeh?? sorry but... &quot;Warlocks are already among weakest classes&quot;<br />
if you are playing a warlock and do feel like you are among the weakest classes then i sudgest that you reroll to a diff class or start learning to play your class properly, ive sen locks in raids that is constant at top5 at dps.</div></div><hr />
