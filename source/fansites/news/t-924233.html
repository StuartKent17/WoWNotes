Patch 4.2 - Rage of the Firelands Wallpaper<br />
Blizzard released a nice patch 4.2 themed wallpaper (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/media/wallpapers/patch?view#/rage-of-the-firelands)<br />

<br />
The talent Killing Machine can now properly be triggered from off-hand attacks as well as main-hand attacks.<br />

Unleash Wind now deals 175% weapon damage, up from 125%.<br />

Stormstrike now deals 225% weapon damage, up from 125%.<br />

Conquest &amp; Honor Points<br />
<br />
The minimum cap on Conquest Points earned per week from Arenas is now 1500 1350 at 1500 or less Battleground Arena rating. The maximum cap remains 2700 is now 3000 at 3000 or more Battleground Arena rating. The cap continues to scale non-linearly between those two points. For comparison, during season 9 the cap ranged between 1343 and 3000.<br />
<br />
<br />
The game now separately tracks different Conquest Point caps for Battlegrounds and Arenas. The cap for Arena rating will always be 2/3 of the cap for Rated Battleground rating at any given Arena rating. Battleground ratings receive a bonus of 22.2% to the cap they generate, meaning the cap from Battleground rating now ranges between 1650 and 3300. Players may earn a total number of Conquest Points per week equal to the higher of these two caps, but once players have reached the cap for either Arenas or Battlegrounds, they can no longer earn Conquest Points from that source. Conquest Points from Battleground holidays only count toward the total Conquest Point cap.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Example: During the first week of Season 10 everyone starts with a rating below 1500. Therefore, the cap from Rated Battlegrounds will be 1500 1650 and the cap from Arena rating will be 1000 1350. In the first week, the character wins enough Arena matches to reach the 1000 1350 point cap. After that point, Arena wins will no longer grant Conquest points for the week. However, the character can still earn up to 500 300 additional points, but can only earn those points from either Rated Battlegrounds, or from the Conquest Point bonus for holiday and/or daily random Battlegrounds. The following week the cap will be recalculated based on the character's ratings, and it is possible Arena rating could now generate the higher cap. The second week, the character's cap from Arena rating is 1600 1800, and the cap from Rated Battlegrounds is 1500 1650. The character has a total cap of 1600 1800 Conquest points for the week. Up to 1500 1650 points can be earned from Rated Battlegrounds, but the last 100 150 must come from a different source.<br />

They should just make so that the farther your ratings are apart, the less the lower player's rating is taken into account.<br />
<br />
E.g. if the highest player and lowest player are less than 150 apart, they use the average MMR of the two players.<br />
If the highest player and the lowest player are between 150 and 300 apart, they use 60% of the higher player's MMR and 40% of the lower player's MMR.<br />
If the highest player and the lowest player are between 300 and 450 apart, they use 70% of the higher player's MMR and 30% of the lower player's MMR.<br />
If the highest player and the lowest player are between 450 and 600 apart, they use 80% of the higher player's MMR and 20% of the lower player's MMR.<br />
If the highest player and the lowest player are between 600 and 750 apart, they use 60% of the higher player's MMR and 10% of the lower player's MMR.<br />
If the highest player and the lowest player are over 750 apart, they use the higher player's MMR.<br />
<br />

Problem Solved?<br />
<br />
There isn't a problem to begin with, the problem is bad players who complain about imaginary problems because other bad players have friends that miraculously managed to bind more than three abilities and are now 2200 players and are carrying their friends that drool too hard on their keyboard to figure out what a focus macro does to ratings that are still horrible but is slightly less horrible than the people complaining. Anyone that finds the need to complain that people get carried deserve to be held down at the ratings below those being carried, because chances are they're terrible anyway.</div></div><hr />

It's good to comment on something you don't understand. Don't know what mods think about writing an explanation here since blizzard remove the threads as soon somone mention it.<br />
<br />
This exploit req you to have a 85 alt. Now you take your alts and spam lose with them by just losing arena. You get them to 0 rating. Now when you done it. You play with one main. and 2 alts. Now your mmr will be low and you grab it up to 2k again for example which is the best you can for example.<br />
<br />
Now you will have 1 char with insane mmr. Probably around 3k. Now you do the same procedure with next guy in your team. 1 on their main and other two guys on the alts.<br />
<br />
You finish it doing with all 3 chars and make a 3v3 togheter with your mains. Grats now all 3 of you will have around 3k mmr. Now this system wants to put you where your mmr belong. So even if you take 50% win ratio against 2.4k teams you will end up around 2.7k rating. Gratz to gladiator. If you are good you can even exploit harder and get 4k mmr. Resulting in easy 3.2k+ rating.<br />
<br />
Grats to rank 1 while not being good enough for it.<br />
<br />
The way blizzard fix this is dumb. Let's make it so they can't see their personal mmr. But still be able to exploit it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stormstrike/Unleash combined probably account for what, 5-6% of total damage? So these buffs would really only add something like 2-3% to total damage. So long as the majority of Enhance damage is passive, wouldn't a buff to crit/haste/agi be necessary to truly have an impact? Or a significantly higher increases to active spells, moving more damage to active?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stormstrike/Unleash combined probably account for what, 5-6% of total damage? So these buffs would really only add something like 2-3% to total damage. So long as the majority of Enhance damage is passive, wouldn't a buff to crit/haste/agi be necessary to truly have an impact? Or a significantly higher increases to active spells, moving more damage to active?Pretty good guess there :)<br />

<br />
<br />
yeah very good start, not1) I said good, not very good.<br />
2) Changing stormstrike (which does 5-6% of our damage) from 125% to 225% weapon damage which will result in it doing close to double the effective damage is a good buff. Not as good as we're hoping for but it's a start....hoping it doesn't end there because if it does I'll agree with you and see if I can find my protest banners.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And we need to know this because ...?<br />
<br />
<br />
E.g. if the highest player and lowest player are less than 150 apart, they use the average MMR of the two players.<br />
If the highest player and the lowest player are between 150 and 300 apart, they use 60% of the higher player's MMR and 40% of the lower player's MMR.<br />
If the highest player and the lowest player are between 300 and 450 apart, they use 70% of the higher player's MMR and 30% of the lower player's MMR.<br />
If the highest player and the lowest player are between 450 and 600 apart, they use 80% of the higher player's MMR and 20% of the lower player's MMR.<br />
If the highest player and the lowest player are between 600 and 750 apart, they use 60% of the higher player's MMR and 10% of the lower player's MMR.<br />
If the highest player and the lowest player are over 750 apart, they use the higher player's MMR.<br />

Do you even play a shaman? While not ideal (I'd prefer they do something about scaling), these are much-needed buffs all the same. Shaman will not suddenly become FOTM, I guarantee that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*Remains quietly hopeful*<br />
<br />
Remember this won't be given a lot of time for testing on the ptr. It can very well be that once it goes live, they nerf it back down again. Seems to be a movement to appease the masses at the moment..<br />
<br />
<br />
If you take a look at latest PTR DPS simulations, which I'm not saying are all that accurate at the moment, it surely seems this might have been a slight overkill. (Being on par with Warlocks and Rogues &amp; above Warriors)<br />
<br />
However, if (and when) the nerf comes I'm still quite confident that Shamans (Enhancement to be exact) will once again be fairly competitive, which was Blizzards plan all along.</div></div><hr />

Sure.<br />
<br />
But lets face it. It will be more likely released on 28th than 21st. <br />
<br />
The fact that we still had a patch this week means (with 99% certainty - leaving that 1% wiggling room for myself) we won't be seeing a patch on 21st.<br />

There is a chance for the patch to appear on the 21st, here are some reasons why:<br />
<br />
1. Midsummer fire festival is going to happen on the 21st<br />
<br />
2.The trailer for the new patch is already out <br />
<br />
3. There hasn't been any MAJOR updates with the patch notes on the ptr<br />

Trailer being out doesn't really mean a thing, it's more like a good hype to keep us entertained and going just another week longer.<br />
<br />
What comes to Midsummer festival, mm yeah, well it doesn't really require much more than a realm restart does it? That's most likely happening regardless of patch on 21st.<br />
<br />
You might be right and I might be wrong, because who's to say they won't push it out 21st. I'm just hoping they don't because then we do know they rushed the patch once again.</div></div><hr />

I guess we just have to wait when the patch comes out. The patch is basically done, they just need it to put on live servers and see what people think about it and then they can revise the patch</div></div><hr />

So if it comes out on Tuesday its rushed but next Tuesday is just perfect? Face it this patch like every other one will be bug riddled and unplayable most of the week no matter when its released.</div></div><hr />

Looks like you missed the earlier post I made about the same subject, stating that publishing a major patch only a week after the latest PTR patch, is by any standards, rushed.<br />
<br />
Sure we might (and will) find bugs here and there, but be as it may: Time (usually) equals More polished products (in this case, less buggier Patch 4.2).</div></div><hr />

I went on the same page section as the screenshot shown above with the date, http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/patch-notes/4-2 and it it shows 6/16/2011, the date the post was most likely made.

Don't get too excited, it's not a very big buff once you go deeper into the numbers. I think k1037 and dahmer put it best:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't played an Enhance Shammy in over a year, so forgive me if I'm wrong, but given the relatively long cooldowns between Stormstrike/Unleash uses, wouldn't these buffs only have a minor impact on overall DPS?<br />
<br />
Stormstrike/Unleash combined probably account for what, 5-6% of total damage? So these buffs would really only add something like 2-3% to total damage. So long as the majority of Enhance damage is passive, wouldn't a buff to crit/haste/agi be necessary to truly have an impact? Or a significantly higher increases to active spells, moving more damage to active?<br />
Pretty good guess there :)<br />

lol this, frost now sims as top dps spec in the game<br />

mm and arcane can be high because if they move their dps drops like a stone, they are balenced, but having BOTH dk specs top 3 is nothing short of retarded</div></div><hr />

thats a rare fight mechanic, one that doesnt exist in firelands bosses. i play a melee too but to imply frost being buffed by this magnitude is ok is just stupid.<br />
their was only 1 fight of that type in this teir, and in heroic atrem melee could focus on feinds during the air phase. you cant balance classes around mechanics that dont exist in anything other than an extreme minority.</div></div><hr />

But yeah I can see shamans in 372 weapons hitting like trucks , I bet it gets a nerf down, because it is obvious they are doing this just to make shamans chill out a little. This is by far not a permanent solution.</div></div><hr />
