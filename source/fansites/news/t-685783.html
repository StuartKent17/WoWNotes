One of the biggest change introduced with Cataclysm is the simplification of existing stats. I usually get a few mails each week asking me about this, time for a reminder! 
Items Stats 
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, there are plans to streamline the statistics found on items. We want to remove all unnecessary stats, make all existing stats understandable, and make all &quot;core&quot; stats more appealing. Here are some examples of such plans.

One of the biggest change introduced with Cataclysm is the simplification of existing stats. I usually get a few mails each week asking me about this, time for a reminder!<br />
Items Stats<br />
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, there are plans to streamline the statistics found on items. We want to remove all unnecessary stats, make all existing stats understandable, and make all &quot;core&quot; stats more appealing. Here are some examples of such plans.<br />
<br />
MP5: This will be removed from items and replaced with Spirit. All healers will be given a meditation-like ability.<br />
Spell Power: Spell Power is being removed from items as well. Don't panic, we'll be improving Intellect so that it provides mana and Spell Power.<br />
Attack Power: We're removing Attack Power from items as well. Instead, we're allowing Agility to provide the necessary Attack Power for leather and mail wearers. Strength will provide the appropriate amount of Attack Power for plate wearers. This means leather and mail items will no longer be desirable for plate wearers.<br />
Defense: The Defense statistic is also being removed from items so that players no longer have to worry about juggling around &quot;the cap.&quot; Tanks will receive the necessary anti-crit from talents, like Survival of the Fittest.<br />
Armor Penetration: This ability is too confusing and &quot;mathy.&quot; It is being replaced with Mastery, a stat that makes you better at what you do. More on that later!<br />
Haste: Will also increase the rate at which you gain energy, runes, and focus. Retribution paladins and Enhancement shaman will have a talent that allows them to take advantage of this benefit.<br />
Block: Block Value is being removed. Blocking will now always mitigate a percentage of damage.<br />
Stamina: Players will notice more Stamina on gear as Defense, Spell Power, Attack Power and Armor Penetration are removed.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-hunter/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
Also receiving a massive overall are hunters. The hunter’s need to rely upon mana is completely gone, and instead they will use focus. This means hunters will no longer care at all about Intellect, mana regen or Aspect of the Viper. Focus will regenerate continually, similar to how rogues or feral druids regenerate energy. For comparison, rogues regenerate approximately 10 energy per second, whereas hunters will regenerate 6 focus per second. However, Steady Shot can also be used to improve focus regen, and bring the rate at which hunters regenerate focus to 12 per second. The hunter will have a maximum of 100 focus, and shots might cost 30 or 60 focus, with fewer cooldowns on abilities. Another exciting and long-awaited change regards the ammunition system. Ammunition will become an equipable item, and will no longer be consumable. More details on that later! <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-warlock/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br />
The soul shard system is receiving a massive revamp, and will now become a core feature of the warlock class. Soul shards will no longer act as an inventory item, but rather exist as a resource, and appear below the warlock's health and mana bar. A new spell, Soul Burn, will be the only warlock ability to cost a soul shard, and will empower most of your other spells to behave differently. For instance, when combined with Fear it causes the spell to become instant. Other examples include: guaranteeing your Searing Pain spell three critical hits, increased horror effect and additional healing from Death Coil, and instant summoning from your summon demon spell. Soul shards will regenerate quickly upon leaving combat, and you may also be able to use drain soul as a &quot;soul shard evocation.&quot; <br />

<br />
The expansion will also remove a lot of the passive talents for each class like bonuses to hit %, etc ... The goal here is to only keep the fun and useful talents like Body and Soul (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64129/body-and-soul/) or Juggernaut (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/64976/juggernaut/). These bonuses won't disappear, they will be added to your character through the new Mastery system.<br />
<br />
Masteries are the passive bonus you get when you spec in a talent tree, the deeper you go in the tree the higher the bonus is. You can see a small preview in the screenshots below. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin<br />
Holy - +% Healing, +% Spell Crit, +% Crit Heal<br />
Protection - -% Damage Taken, +% Health, +% Block Amount<br />
Retribution - +% Melee Damage, + Melee Crit, -% Ability Cooldown<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
Assassination - +% Melee Damage, +% Melee Crit, +% Poison Damage<br />
Combat - +% Melee Damage, +% Hit Chance, +% Armor Penetration<br />
Subtlety - +% Melee Damage, +% Melee Haste, +% Energy Regeneration<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter <br />
Marksmanship - Unknown Bonus #1, Unknown Bonus #2, Focus Regeneration<br />
Beast Mastery - Unknown Bonus #1, Unknown Bonus #2, Pet Damage<br />
Survival - No information.<br />
<br />
A new Mastery stat will also be added to the game and will let you improve one of this bonus, in the case of the Retribution Paladin the stat affects the bonus to abilities' cooldowns. <br />

Terrain Phasing in Cataclysm<br />
A &quot;minor&quot; feature of Cataclysm is the improved phasing. Wrath of the Lich King allowed developers to phase out NPCs and Cataclysm will let them modify the terrain over time! In the example below you can see 3 stages of terrain phasing :<br />

You really fail at reading don't you? If you would've checked the whole post, you'd notice how combat rogues have a 10% Arpen mastery stat, they said Arpen will be removed, and Mastery will replace it, and will also replace some other &quot;boring&quot; talents. (So a priest mastery, would be 10% SP or 5% more healing, I don't know, but pay attention while reading, cause then you wouldn't need to write that)<br />
<br />
Oh yea, almost forgot. That phasing is daaamn sweet, can't wait to see if we purify the Plaguelands :P Also, the masteries thing is sweet, Cata will be awesome, I'm sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, lets see.<br />
-Hunters have their own resource system. (Similar to rogues, still different)<br />
-Leather/Mail have no use for plate users (im dk running with mail boots since i cant get plate anywhere)<br />
-More &quot;fun&quot; rather than &quot;passive&quot; talents (good if they dont overdo it)<br />
-Soul burn empowerments<br />
-Different Mastery bonuses to all specs<br />
<br />
And thats from this topic only.<br />
<br />
If you talk about the removing of stats, oh well.<br />
It is a game, you don't have to be forced to see every possible theorycraft to play game properly, even MMO.<br />
<br />
And btw, I like theorycrafting, but I also see whats better for the whole playerbase.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PvE_Mage</div><div class="date">2009-12-26, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what about Hit Rating, any word if that will be removed ?</div></div><hr />

they already said that wont happen so lets see what they have planned ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2009-12-26, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">* Block: Block Value is being removed. Blocking will now always mitigate a percentage of damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really don't like the sound of that. I'm certain it's beneficial for high-end raids, but I liked being able to Block whole hits from, say, 5man bosses on my tank, when Shield Block was up. Blocking up to 6600 damage per hit for 10 sec.<br />
Would be dull if I always blocked 50% of hits, which also makes Block worse for trash and levelling... :(<br />
<br />
<br />
* Stamina: Players will notice more Stamina on gear as Defense, Spell Power, Attack Power and Armor Penetration are removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
What can I say. As a prot warrior, AWESOME!<br />
As a PvPer, AWESOME! Obviously they realized the mistake of not buffing health more, while damage just kept getting higher and higher.<br />
Could refer to my warlock, saw a Death Knight with, meh, about 26-27k health, killed her with a Immolate, Shadowfury (instant stun, after immolate hit), Conflagrate and a Chaos Bolt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind the talent trees will be getting their biggest redesign since the game launched. Masteries aren't just out of the blue in addition to existing talents, they're *replacing* the passive talents altogether. All talents will do something &quot;special&quot; rather than just &quot;increases your mojo by eleventy percent&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's meant to, ultimately, remove cookie-cutter specing, because each choice should be a matter of playstyle and personal preference/interest, not a matter of giving up some of the main thing you do in order to do some side thing. It's just picking up a side thing &quot;for free&quot;. The main thing improves with each point spent regardless.<br />
<br />
It'll all depend on how well they implement it, of course, but the *idea* behind it is sound. The devil's in the details, as they say, and hopefully we'll start getting some of those details when the alpha starts and the leaks begin.</div></div><hr />

Major fail comment right here.<br />
<br />
The &quot;dumbed down stats&quot; were existent in pre-TBC World of Warcraft, and the game immensely popular back then. Blizzard are merely returning to &quot;tried and true&quot; methods. But I suppose alot of the haters saying they are dumbing the game down by removing these stats, weren't around pre-TBC. Either started playing WoW late into TBC, or at the start of WotLK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree with you to a point here.Perhaps blizz may allow strength to provide plate wearing classes with extra crit since agil / AP gear is becoming a wasted stat for us. On that note what about deathknights dual wield weapons? Will we get any benefit from the agil on our weapons? although as someone pointed out on a different thread with the new reforging ability for crafters in Cataclysm maybe we can turn it into strength?<br />
<br />
Oh and strength doesnt just give AP for plate wearers. It also gives block for paladins and warriors , and parry for death knights.Kinda useless to dps though.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I wonder how they will do the passive talent bonuses on death knights. Seeing as you can tank/dps in any talent tree. I hope they don't give up on that idea and just make a &quot;prot&quot; talent tree to replace one of those :(.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was wondering about that myself. The only solution I thought of was that you get different stat bonuses depending on the form you're in for druids (cat vs. bear) and the presence you're in for Death Knights (blood &amp; unholy vs. frost).<br />
<br />
Sounds a bit cumbersome though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the big deal? You get armor from plate, you don't really need the dodge (because you already have superior armor and stamina) - it's just the extra crit. Thing is, strength users are balanced to be on par with agility users - but as soon as the strength users put on agility gear it gets OP (hence the whole making agility gear less desirable for strength users). So in reality you're whining about not being able to put on agility gear to be OP and that the stat itself is better than strength without considering anything else...<br />
<br />
I'm much more interested in knowing why warriors changes aren't to be seen anywhere in the haste changes? Rogues, DKs, hunters, shamans, druids and paladins will have their benefits from haste increased, but to warriors it stays a mediocre stat?</div></div><hr />

Either that or dumbed down. 0/76/0 builds inc. Cuz right now we all have a lot of points in resto to pick a few talents there. Just like any other class always has a few tps in other trees. The point is you cant just dump all the talents in one tree, fill out everything possible and it'd be the best. Or feral tree is gonna be so bloated with talents that you can't possibly fill it out even if spending 76 there?<br />
<br />
I don't know.. This is so disturbing, how are they gonna split dps and tanking mastery since it's both in one tree? Or give 2 masteries at once? Damage reduction and damage increase? Wouldnt it be considered &quot;op&quot;?<br />
<br />
But i bet they will half-ass it like they alwas did in the last 5 years. leading to subpar, crude gameplay and raw power lack that you can only make up for with exceptional player skill &gt;.&lt; Considering general dumbing down of stuff it's gonna get harder for pro players to outshine mediocrity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they are buffing stamina considerably, how will damage by handled.<br />
<br />
In PvE, they have said they want healers to have a more interesting game style, choosing expensive heals over cheap ones, a constant healing stream for tanks.<br />
<br />
Granted the raid should require a lot less healing, but if the Raid is getting buffed with stamina also, damage from AoE effects is going to be buffed also. This means that healers will need to be able to heal that much damage back. Meaning that the increased health isn't really effecting anything. AoE hits 5k per tick now, if its hitting 25k per tick in Cataclysm then healers will need to be able to heal 25k per tick to compensate.<br />
<br />
From a tank perspective, they are saying it will be steady damage, and lots of it. But if a healer can heal 25k damage per tick I am not sure how much is going to change in raids?<br />
<br />
If everything is being scaled equally, I don't think there is any change in dynamic at all.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I guess we will see how it all plays out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example: If you were healing a tank in MC for example. The raid required more than one healer on the tank, and for good reason, because not all classes had HOTS, instants, etcs. Now with the health pools going up all the way round, and blizzard openly stating that they want more decision based healing, I would suspect it will be a combination of our current progression of talents/abilities with some regression into the old style.<br />
<br />
I am guessing you will be able to take a Shaman with earth shield, and use him on the main tank for ES, and lets say Riptide. Then the shaman would revert to his chain heals and help heal the raid. I'm guessing that spells like Riptide will not be as powerful as they are now, and you will need to go back and use your base spells in more regularly than you do now. I.E. Keeping Riptide and ES up, and using Healing Wave, and Lesser Healing Wave together in support of each other to keep the targets topped off. <br />
<br />
Lets face it, face rolling like you can now is absolutely boring.<br />
<br />
I have played a healer (priest/shaman) and tank (warrior/pally/dk) throughout wow's existence, and am loving some things they have already brought back. <br />
<br />
I love Halls of Reflection on my warrior; gives me nostalgia, because you can't just run in and dps things down. You have to use all your tools, and play smart. Challenges like that are what made vanilla wow so good at times.<br />
<br />
I hope they keep coming with these types of changes, it only can help make the game better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all - FORGET THE DAMN ACTUALL MECHANICS! Those won't work for cata anymore. Like the DPS/Tanktree for druids ... mostly it will go like the ice tree from dk's with tank, dual wield and dps talents. The more tank talents you choose, the more tank specific rates you get, same for dps, heal etc.<br />
<br />
It's really not that complicated.<br />
<br />
Then to the &quot;simplyfied&quot; stats - that's a good thing!<br />
<br />
1. They can make better gear for specific classes - think about how boomkins QQ about the spirit on their gear (more crit &gt; more mana regen &gt; spirit wasted)<br />
2. The gear is easier to identify for a specific class - spirit will be heal, str will be plate dps etc. - right now it's hard for a raidleader to decide, if an item is caster or heal or DPS etc. because he has to KNOW the classes using it. Like the mace from battered hilt - int, stam, haste, crit and spellpower - can be heal or caster dps<br />
3. Easier for the ppl to rate the gear - without attackpower etc. you have an easier way to compare some gear. Still - if you want to use the max. out of your char, you have to do some theory, but it will help the new ppl to decide whats good and whats not.<br />
<br />
Then to the &quot;armor pen not mathy&quot; ...<br />
<br />
Armor pen SUCKS. Tell me right off your head what's better, +30 crit or +30 arp? Well, you can't ...<br />
<br />
Easy example with my resto shaman - when I see gear with crit and another one with haste, I can easily decide &quot;hey, I go for crit cause I already have a nice hasterating&quot;<br />
<br />
That won't work for armor pen ... if you want to know what's better, atk power or armor pen, you have to calc it out of wow. point.<br />
<br />
Here's some small info I found about<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler delivers the formula for the Armor Pen cap in the following bit of pseudo code (I've cleaned it a bit for readability sake):<br />
<br />
Let C be the Armor Penetration constant.<br />
<br />
if ( level &lt; 60 )<br />
C = 400 + ( 85 * targetlevel )<br />
else<br />
C = 400 + ( 85 * targetlevel ) + ( 4.5 * 85 * (targetlevel – 59))<br />
<br />
Thus where a level 80 mob is being attacked, C = 15232.5. For a level 83 mob C = 16635.<br />
<br />
The cap for Armor Penetration is then: (Armor + C) / 3<br />
<br />
A quick example, used originally by Ghostcrawler but extrapolated upon here:<br />
<br />
Assume a level 80 death knight NPC (note: non player character) has 9729 armor. C for level 80 mobs is 15232.5. The Armor Penetration cap is (9729 + 15232.5) / 3 = 8320.5. At this point the game will choose the lowest of two values, either 8320.5 or 9729, to represent the most armor which can be ignored. We'll call this value X. So X = 8320.5.<br />
<br />
A person is attacking with 30% Armor Penetration. The game will then compute the amount of armor to be ignored against the previous value X, which means the amount of armor ignored on our level 80 death knight NPC is 2496.15 (30% of 8320.5), which we'll call M. M is then subtracted from the death knight's actual armor, which means the attack goes through against 9729 – 2496.15 = 7232.85 armor present.<br />
<br />
Just because something is highly complicated, it dosn't make it good. You should be able to decide ingame what's better for you and don't have to calculate it over some hours in a spritesheet.<br />
<br />
As for the incoming HP, Heal etc. changes - just wait. Based on what we know for now, it's useless to speculate. Even Blizzard isn't sure about it.</div></div><hr />

One of the biggest change introduced with Cataclysm is the simplification of existing stats.<br />
<br />
Simplifying it may be a good thing, but they are doing it wrong.<br />
It doesn't make it more understandable that intelligence equals spellpower - they shouldn't remove spellpower. Likewise that agility is instead of attackpower - this is just going to totally confuse the more normal players even more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, they should remove spell power as unique stat and make it like AP from Strength / Agility. <br />
<br />
The only spell power which should stay like now are probably on gems and enchants with it<br />
<br />
I always wondered why there is no attribute scaling for magic spells while melee and hunter ranged damage both scale to some extend from base attribute. <br />
<br />
In that regard spellcaster in vanilla before spell damage/healing were implement had been either OP or underpowered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the current system, you have non-stackable stats, and cappable stats.<br />
<br />
At any given time, one stat will be the best (for example strength). Some stats are best until capped (hit, armor pen, expertise), and after that, they stop being useful. Ever tried balancing gear around 2 hard caps and one soft cap? And still, stacking means that one stat will still be best.<br />
<br />
Sadly, I have to reevaluate the values of different stats with simulators every second upgrade or so.<br />
<br />
And interesting stats...you can't buff haste for one class which isn't benefitting alot from haste without making it too strong for other classes. Same problem they encountered with armor pen, the difference between warriors, who are only using physical damage compared to mixed damage like DKs and palas.</div></div><hr />

That way, while you still may get *some* plate wearers wearing leather/mail, you won't see it as much. Where it would really pay off would be that plate wearers could benefit more from agility weapons and leather/mail wearers from strength weapons -- particularly 2H maces and axes for druids or hunters, for instance.<br />

<br />
talent tree bonuses pretty cool (tho it might discourage hybrid dps to specc few points in off trees, if bonuses from main one will be superior to those minor talents from off trees...), phasing pretty cool, warlocks no longer needing loads of shards cool, overall meh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The three main stats: Strength, Agility and Intelligence. Depending on your class and spec, one of these is going to improve your damage. Just like in warcraft 3. <br />
<br />
The role-specific stats: hit, spirit, dodge/parry. For dpsers, healers and tanks respective. These improve your role; allowing dpsers to not miss, healers to regen more mana and last longer, and tanks to take less damage. <br />
<br />
Then we have stamina, armor and magic resistances, which everyone want a little of depending on the situation; tanks significantly more than others. <br />
<br />
And we have the metastats, which improve you indirectly: haste, crit and mastery. Everyone will want these. <br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
As a healer, I'm worried that int will be too good. If int gives us regen, larger manapool, &quot;spellpower&quot; and some crit, why the hell do we want spirit anyway? Agility is also very powerful, granting dodge, &quot;attackpower&quot;, hit and armor. Strength, in comparison, only offers damage. We'll see what happens; I'm rather positive that some of the side benefits from the main stat will be eliminated.</div></div><hr />

LFD uses Need before Greed, so it won't be possible. In raids, just hope your leader has senses.<br />

With the introduction of Reforging this is essentially how it will work anyway, as you could Reforge the Agility into Strength but doing so reduces the stat by 50%. (If I remember correctly it reduces it by half) I believe they are reducing it by that much and only allowing you to reforge one stat per item in order to avoid a situation where one piece of gear that you would normally avoid is BiS if reforged correctly, but this is just my own speculation based on the way they are reworking the stats and the reasons thy give for doing so.</div></div><hr />

Are you really really really sure you didn't notice how stupid this would be? If that is not enough for you to take a notice here goes. Do you ever see str in leather/mail/cloth gear? Can hunter/shaman/rogue/druid wear plate?<br />

As for the concerns about int and agi becoming 'super stats', I remember blizzard stating that they might scale back the crit and mana from int, and the dodge and crit form agi. But with no spellpower and ap, there is more item budget for int and agi, so things should remain the same.<br />

<br />
<br />
Resto/Ele Shaman will want Int,Crit,Spirit,Haste,Mastery in varying degrees.<br />
<br />
Hunter/Enh Shaman will want Agi,Crit,Haste/Mastery (and exp for shamans). So the 1 item per spec thing shouldn't be too severe? Enhances have talents to regen mana, they won't need spirit.</div></div><hr />

HAHAHA, you tell them mate, i totally agree with ya there, so much i'm looking forward to and so much that i'm just gonna wanna /facepalm over. i mean come on, dropping defense coz its too hard to reach cap... are ppl fuckin retarded, i easily reached 540 defense in full blues, wasn't hard at all, just grind a few instance til you get the item you need to hit defense cap, then start raidin same shit goes there, grind the raids til you get the gear you want, and getting shit crafted has never been easier... come on Blizzard, don't make this game anymore FACEROLL than it already is... make it fuckin way harder, like in BC, now that was fun, i've pretty much given up on 80 raiding because it is FUCKIN BORING... everything is faceroll, not strategy required, healers stand there, caster DPS stand there, tank boss over here, off tank over there, 3rd off tank over here, melee DPS spread out behind boss in a arc must stay 10 yards away from each other, when trash mob spawns, off tanks will pick it up, caster DPS burn add, melee DPS stay on main boss... the difficult strategies of the BC bosses no longer exist anymore... everything is too easy these days... and i'm sick and tired of getting stuck in guilds that have ppl with 5K gear scores and don't know how to fuckin DPS, its like that gear they are wearing isn't actually epic, i've honestly seen ppl in blues and Naxx 10 epics do sweet DPS, coz they know &quot;HOW&quot; to play their class, instead of facerolling and hoping for the best, it sickens me that there is no more challenge to this game... so fuckin suck it up blizz and bring some of the challenge back... at least for the hard core raiders anyways... maybe there might be more ppl like me who actually get back into raiding coz there will be a challenge there... maybe you should read forums that aren't blizz controlled and you could see where everyone is actually bitching at you to make it harder... but no... you don't fuckin listen, its all about making it easier for the new player... FUCK THAT, i had to learn how to play the hard way... so can the new ppl, and if they can't handle it... then they shouldn't be playing</div></div><hr />

Did they say defence was too hard to cap? I can't remember those exact words.<br />
<br />
Edit: Upon re-reading they said 'juggling aroud the cap'. My interpretation is removing the need to re-gem for defense after changing from a blue to purple that has bings more dodge/parry/stamina but less defense. I sure as hell found that annoying.</div></div><hr />

Vanilla had horrible itemization while some of the stats introduced in BC are useless to some specs. Armor Penetration = useless to Rets and Enhancement.<br />
<br />
And they're removing AP and SP because when you get new gear, you have to make a choice but it's harder to do that when one gear has more agility but the other gear has more attack power and you have to do the math.<br />
<br />
This is an effing MMO game not NASA. If you want to do a math go to college or build a rocket ship for NASA.<br />

thanks Captain Obvious for point that out! ... i KNOW what caster shaman will want, all i wonder is why, since this change WILL mean more stoen clothes for shaman/paladins<br />

regarding enha, right now, they have pretty big bonuses from int, not to mention they cant work with only base mana quite well, less manapool = less replenishment, less whatever else %mana based, unless their system is reworked to work without intelect on gear, they will be either underperforming or there will be 2 types of agi mail gear...</div></div><hr />

Mana regen will work for all healers the way it works for Priests.<br />
<br />
Everyone will get Attack Power and Spell power the same way Plate classes get their AP.<br />
<br />
All Tanks will get their anti-crit the same way Druids do.<br />
<br />
Armor Penetration will work the same way it does now for specs that need it, it's just that it won't be a completely useless stat for classes that don't need it, but one stat on gear that's individualized for every spec.<br />
<br />
Notice a common theme? Everything they're doing is already being done in-game! They're just expanding on what works and removing what isn't working so well.<br />
<br />
Haste gets buffed to benefit melee classes more, Block gets a much-needed scaling change, and Stamina is absolutely needed to keep the PVP fights from lasting 3 seconds between fresh 85's with no resilience.</div></div><hr />

Yes, Rawr does everything for you. When cataclysm hits, you won't need to use Rawr. How is that bad? And no matter how simple(read:more useful) they make the stats it won;t make people move from fire faster...</div></div><hr />

if you get that &quot;other&quot; knowledge from ej or you actually do it yourselves is irrelevant , you still needed to investigate it and it was a fun mini game in itself , most of the math is basic 1+2 and a maybe think about it more than 1 sec thats all. , but i guess it doesnt matter you FPS guys won , whatever you had to carefully think about before will now finally be gone. have fun in your game. <br />

I'm right there with you. When I first got into this game, I was one of those players that would be confused about why they had to make so many changes and why they would do things certain ways. As odd as certain things that the folks a Blizzards are doing may seem, they usually always work out for the better. I think the updates will help refine the stats, minimizing confusion not just for casuals, but for the hardcore players as well. There are so many things that overlap in this came, they changes certainly make sense if people really think about it. I don't see what's so wrong about caturing parts of the game to casuals, or what's so wrong with casuals. Not everyone can spend 40 plus hours playing just this one game. The game has elements for all types of players, lore for the big role players out there, PvP for the competitive types, hard modes for the hardcore players looking for a challenge, minipets and etc. for the vannity junkies, and the new LFG among other things for those with less time to play.<br />
<br />
Regardless of what happens, there's always going to be QQ'ers, trolls, theorycrafters, and just people here to play the game. Most of the people complaining here probablly still have a $15/month subscription, as they will continue to have for the next year if not longer.</div></div><hr />

All that aside, im sure this'll greatly simplify gear understanding and most of the improvements are big leaps forward into making the game more comfortable for.. YES. CASUALS. Lets face it, if you're not a casual, youre probably an addict like i used to be. The game really loses its touch after 6 or so hours a day... imo any more than 2 is social suicide.

Really just sucks there aren't any really good MMOs to really go off to currently, they either fail horrible or have some serious issues.</div></div><hr />

Not wanting to plug all of my gear into a spreadsheet each time I want to check my possible upgrades vs drops doesn't exactly make me a scrub. I've done enough multi-variable calculus in my life that I need not do it while playing a game. <br />
<br />
While I agree that eventually boiling it down to one final stat of &quot;+good&quot; would be a bit much, some streamlining needed to be done on the gear since gem sockets, possible enchants, green +stat text, and base stats really made it annoying to find the correct combination of them all to maintain the required +hit/crit/AP/Str/ArPen ratios to maximize DPS on a shifting sweet spot with a given build, but worthless to another character of the same class with three different talent choices.</div></div><hr />

I hear using rawr is a lot easier then a spreadsheet.....or just knowing the in-outs of your class works also.</div></div><hr />

Removing def rating, ap, spellpower.. who the fuck cares? Buhu, I wanna theorycraft? As Piptooth said, he like to therocraft.. but yet he let's RAWR do the work for him? He clicks with his mouse a couple of times.. geez, theorycrafting with addons are hard.<br />
I, personally.. don't give a shit about the statchanges.. they are bitching way to much with stat-balancing and does not focus on RAID MAKING, when I first started the game.. it was about raiding.. it was fun! Now it's only a load of bullshit and cunts like Piptooth that think they are hardcore cuz they can use addons. Fuck that, I want hard raiding content.. I don't give a shit about which stats are on the gear.. stats are fucking stats in the end! Would you rather spend 90% of your playtime calculating stats, and 10% on raiding? How fun is that? I'm not saying math is boring, hard.. or anything else. But I don't play this fucking game to do math. To all of you dipshits whining about stat changes out there, fuck off.<br />
<br />
And yeah, this is loads of nerd-rage. I quit this game for one reason, and one reason only.. the raids are bullshit! People care to fucking much about stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Increased Agility.<br />
2. Increaed Critical Strike chance (threat/Savage Defense for bears, more Attack Power/Crit for Cats.<br />
3. When in Bear Form, (insert nice Bear bonus here). When in Cat Form, your critical hits do xx% more damage. Or something along those lines.<br />
<br />
Really, it's not that complicated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
now is the challange to get the maximum efactive combination of gear... and after they change it this will turn to be what better 1str or 1 agi..<br />
it's idiotic<br />
<br />
like Diablo 2 all the items rank was how much str u have is more dmg.. that's the most boaring thing they can do<br />
for example tanks wont have def rating? so u just put few points on talent tree and u capped?? bah <br />
the meaning avoidance will disappear.. all the tanks will be pure stamina tanks<br />
and this is just crap<br />
<br />
i think the moment they will do this i will stop play the game</div></div><hr />

<br />
Precisely : the maths that 99% people use in WoW are totally trivial and non-interesting.<br />
<br />
People either don't optimize their gear, either visit Elitist Jerks and simply do what is written. If you are complaining about the game being less interesting because you don't have to visit EJ where you learn that you have to compute 2 + 2 anymore, then you probably have no idea of what &quot;interesting&quot; means...<br />
<br />
It's stupid. It's preferable to have less stats but understandable, and to use you brain to know which you should chose, rather than having a lot of stats and go on a website without questionning what you are told there.<br />
<br />
The only ones who could possibly claim that the game is becoming more trivial are the true theorycrafters or so. I mean the guy that codes Rawr or writes the Excel spreadsheet. Not the ones that let does soft do all the job, which has no interest at all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">courtlung</div><div class="date">2009-12-29, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am very curious to see how they re-organize the talent trees to accommodate these changes.<br />
<br />
For instance, they specifically list 'Fire and Brimstone' as being the type of passive talent that would get cut. This talent is indeed passive, but it only affects a few spells, and effects them in a major way that changes the damage rotation for the tree. You won't be able to replace this effect with some global passive mastery, so if you flatly remove it, that will be a large reduction in power for the spells unless you offset the spells themselves with direct buffs.<br />
<br />
That also seems unlikely though; having to go around and make little tweaks to all the spells and abilities that are effected by targeted passive talents like this in order to offset the removal of said talents. If that were the idea, why even make the change to the talents in the first place? Seems like it would only exacerbate the issue of having too many complicated tooltips. What seems more likely, is that they will just wipe the slate clean, and rebuild all 30 trees, disconnecting them entirely from the playstyle we are used to at level 80.<br />
<br />
Naturally, that might not be the most comforting thought for some, but I am genuinely excited to see what they come up with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thing, is the Critical Bonus Damage talents. I don't see any mastery stats on the rogue or pally trees that increase bonus crit damage. This stat in particular currently only exists in talents, is passive, and is absolutely vital to any spec that has it available. One such talent (for arcane mages) is on the chopping block in the presentation, so we must assume that to be the same for other classes as well. Very curious to see if this stat just disappears, or if they find some way of making it affected by gear.<br />
<br />
If they put this in as a mastery, I think any damage spec without it would just end up being abandoned by the playerbase.</div></div><hr />

Cataclysm 2(why come up witha new name when you just can add a 2): <br />
<br />
Northrend revised! The cold place have become warm and penguins replaced by rabbits! OH YEA<br />
All old dungeons being merged to one singel dungeon to make it simple for everyone. Ofcourse it only have one boss too. Same dungeon for 5,10,25 man! SICK!<br />
All stats removed to make it easy for everyone to understand! No more hard decisions to make &quot;should i have int or str on my warrior?&quot;! THANK GOD!</div></div><hr />
