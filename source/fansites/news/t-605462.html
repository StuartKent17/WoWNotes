&lt;a name=&quot;noteupdate&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Update #2 - Patch notes have been updated on both EU and US official sites and Kalgan made an interesting blue post regarding class balance in Arena. <br />
In Memoriam: Gary Gygax<br />
Blizzard Entertainment would like to dedicate the patch in memory of Gary Gygax. His work on D&amp;D was an inspiration to us in many ways and helped spark our passion for creating games of our own. As avid D&amp;D players and fellow game developers, we were all saddened by the news of his passing; we feel we’ve lost a true adventuring companion. Thanks for everything and farewell, Gary. You will be missed.<br />

Class balance in Arenas<br />
No other warlock nerfs are planned for 2.4. One of the things we look at is class representation in arenas (although normalized for class popularity). In this particular chart, a value of 100% means the class is represented as we'd expect, a value over 100% means the class is represented that much more often than we'd expect, a value below 100% means they're represented less than we'd want (obviously this chart doesn't include a spec breakdown in any way).<br />
<br />
<br />
one other detail regarding the chart, this one is set at 2200+ rating.<br />
<br />
2v2 3v3 5v5<br />
Druid	276.0%	184.0%	80.5%<br />

Locks are doing pretty well overall, but what had us worried was that it appeared to us a month ago or so as though warlocks were on an uptrend. However, the evidence is strong that that trend is reversing, which means significant nerfs aren't really what we want right now (we really don't know where those numbers will settle down).<br />
<br />
Update - The Twin Eredars are killable again, and we'll probably see a few new items from them ! The first of them is [Book of Highborne Hymns] (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/bookofhighbornehymns.jpg)<br />

Undocumented class changes<br />
Due to the nature of the Warlocks and Shaman changes, you should seriously wait for a confirmation from an official source before going crazy. (I could also be wrong and suck at interpreting game files.)<br />

<br />
Being serious though I liked the flametongue change, ah well, enhancement shammies have only themselves to blame if it gets reverted.<br />
<br />
The life tap change was terrible for low level warlocks, 5 life taps to cast one shadow bolt is a bit of a joke. They should have made it a fixed percentage of health but scaled the mana restoration with level. I.e. instead of whatever health cost you see listed make it 15% health into X mana at each rank. That way they can achieve the PvP nerf without serious affect on PvE which is what they wanted.</div></div><hr />

Already said that the flametongue would not work properly in terms of mechanics.<br />

Just sort of makes me laugh, even though i know they said the ptr was there for testing things, the fact that not much else of significance was changed with these two classes besides the incinerate change for locks and making rage undispellable (i didn't mention ES changes since it seems like many resto shamans are still in a toss up between whether or not it's a good or bad thing)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what blizzard was trying to do with changing lifetap, almost certainly seemed like it had to be a nerf (not that it didn't act like one on the PTR but i mean nerf as in they were putting it in the game to be a nerf) but with all the adjustments they were trying to make to it, it was hard to follow what they were really trying to accomplish with the changes.<br />
<br />
Flametounge ms...shamans were never asking for this in the first place, and it's usefulness was situationally effective in pvp (and a few pve situations if for some reason you had no rogues able to put up wounding) So if this change was reverted and tossed in the idea dumpster, i have a feeling that there are going to be plenty of shamans who don't really care, provided that this means we can hope for some changes that are, for lack of a better description, not completely out of left field. Some ideas that don't look like they just tossed darts at a bunch of post it notes on the office wall would be appreciated, here's a brainstorming session starter...mobility/lockdown counters. Run with it dev's!</div></div><hr />

* Blizzard Entertainment would like to dedicate the patch in memory of Gary Gygax. His work on D&amp;D was an inspiration to us in many ways and helped spark our passion for creating games of our own. As avid D&amp;D players and fellow game developers, we were all saddened by the news of his passing; we feel we’ve lost a true adventuring companion. Thanks for everything and farewell, Gary. You will be missed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Might interest some people.<br />
<br />
<br />
The interesting quote copied below for benefit of the lazy:<br />
<br />
No other warlock nerfs are planned for 2.4. One of the things we look at is class representation in arenas (although normalized for class popularity). In this particular chart, a value of 100% means the class is represented as we'd expect, a value over 100% means the class is represented that much more often than we'd expect, a value below 100% means they're represented less than we'd want (obviously this chart doesn't include a spec breakdown in any way).<br />
<br />
<br />
2v2 3v3 5v5<br />
Druid 276.0% 184.0% 80.5%<br />
Hunter 43.0% 50.2% 43.0%<br />
Mage 8.7% 96.0% 96.0%<br />
Paladin 19.7% 29.5% 147.4%<br />
Priest 113.3% 164.8% 185.4%<br />
Shaman 37.8% 50.4% 138.6%<br />
Rogue 144.2% 175.1% 61.8%<br />
Warlock 149.2% 93.2% 111.9%<br />
Warrior 130.4% 90.7% 79.3%<br />
<br />
Locks are doing pretty well overall, but what had us worried was that it appeared to us a month ago or so as though warlocks were on an uptrend. However, the evidence is strong that that trend is reversing, which means significant nerfs aren't really what we want right now (we really don't know where those numbers will settle down).<br />
<br />
Edit: one other detail regarding the chart, this one is set at 2200+ rating.<br />
<br />
Very interesting, I have said it before, adjusted for population Warrior is the most balanced Arena class in the game. It looks like priests can expect a whack of the nerf bat in the not too distant future and more buffs for Hunters. Mages, contrary to the constant whining seem to be pretty much ideally balanced in 3v3 and 5v5. The paladins are hurting badly in 2v2 and 3v3 though.<br />
<br />
Just for interest here is an average accross all three brackets ordered by highest to lowest:<br />
<br />
Druid 180.1%<br />
Priest 154.5%<br />
Rogue 127.0%<br />
Warlock 118.1%<br />
Warrior 100.1%<br />
Shaman 75.6%<br />
Mage 66.3%<br />
Paladin 65.5%<br />
Hunter 45.4%<br />
<br />
So the two most overpowered classes: Druid and Priest<br />
The two least powerful classes: Hunter and Paladin (with mage a close third).<br />
<br />
Other points that go against the popular perception:<br />
<br />
Rogues are more powerful than Warriors.<br />
Shamans are more powerful than Paladins.<br />
Warriors are pretty much perfectly balanced if you average the three brackets and the second most balanced class is the Warlock followed by the Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is that a typo? That'd be 91.3 % less mage then they expected / wanted it to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
no, it is not a typo. As % are adjusted for population and mages are one of the more popular classes and, at the same time the one with less representation on the 2v2 (along with shammies/palas), that is what you get. Nothing surprising<br />
<br />
Regarding warriors remember that they are the one of the most popular classes (second only to hunters I think). So while one see lots of warriors on top, as they have high pop, when normalized the representation is not as &quot;excessive&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2008-03-06, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">An interesting thought.<br />
<br />
In theory the best way to promote balance is to buff the least popular classes in ways that work specifically against the most powerful classes with the strength of the buff specifically relative to the imbalance.<br />
<br />
So give hunters a large buff vs druids, give paladins a moderate buff vs priest, and give shaman and mage small buffs vs warlock and rogue respectively.<br />
<br />
This should, in theory make the buffs be of benefit in an appropriate amount of situations. So with that in mind here are some suggestions:<br />
<br />
Hunter: Increase range of Scare Beast to 20 or 30 yards. Make Serpent Sting reduce healing over time affects on the target by 50%.<br />
Paladin: Give righteous fury a 30% chance to reflect mana drain affects while active.<br />
Mage V Rogue, nothing springs to mind.<br />
Shaman: Make Earth Shield remove up to 2 negative magic affects from the target when it fades or is dispelled.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I doubt it will make any difference. Right now those gems go for about 2g each on most servers, with the new recipe you can use 18 of them to make a blue gem which is probably worth in or around the 36g of mats it would take to make one. The profit margins would be very small for doing the change, depending on the gem you would make or lose a couple of gold probably breaking even over time but the hassle factor involved in buying 18 small gems is high enough that I doubt many people would even be bothered.<br />
<br />
I suppose if they are really common on your server they might go from about 1g now to 2-2.5g each but beyond that there is no profit margin in using the recipe.</div></div><hr />

Demand for blue gems goes down, supply goes up, price goes down. These changes affect miners, and JC. The only thing the JC will have that will keep them profitable is cutting epic gems, aka people who can raid Hyjal.</div></div><hr />

And I wonder how they correct for activity of the different classes. Hunter seems underrepresented, but I know quite a number of people who have hunters as alts (farm machine) and why should that influence arena nerfs/buffs.</div></div><hr />

Actually on the actualized post there is one interesting data about hunters - their representation doesn't vary much when you lower the &quot;filter&quot; from 2200+ to 1850+. It seems that their underrepresentation does not comes from underperformance but from relatively few hunters (compared to the hunter population) engage in the arena. That or they have a weird class skill&amp;gear distribution.</div></div><hr />

on a serious note, the gem thing is really nice, prospecting will become worthwhile again, hopefully driving the price of ore up (i'm a miner :)) but the price of rare gems will most likely decrease as more of them flood the market and people move on up to epic gems (i'm a JC'er :()</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Psykhe</div><div class="date">2008-03-06, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very interesting, I have said it before, adjusted for population Warrior is the most balanced Arena class in the game.<br />
<br />
Adjusting for population has two catch 22s, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Firstly, arenas have been here for a long time. This means the players already adjusted to it. An example:<br />
<br />
Lets say we have only 2 classes, with one being vastely better in arena than the other. This remains like this for 2 years, then you see how much a % adjusted for population is in arenas. And you will get for both classes relatively similar values.<br />
<br />
Why? Because if people see that one class is bad in what they want to do and one class is good they will in most cases obviously roll the better classes. And as result increase its population. The same reason why people who want to solo PvE/farm do not roll holy priests, but hunters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which brings us to, secondly, what most people of a class are doing. If one class does averagely in arenas, but is very good in PvE it will have a less than average percentage of it in arenas if you adjust for population, even if its performance is not sub-average. Because the high amount of it in PvE is skewing the numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
In short <br />
- if a class is above (below) average performance in arenas its imbalance, if it is nothing recent, will make it appear less (more) overpopulated in arenas if adjusted for population. <br />
- if a class is above (below) average performance in PvE its imbalance, if it is nothing recent, will make it appear more (less) underpopulated in arenas if adjusted for population. <br />
<br />
Of cource these two factors can cancel each other out. But just because they *can* does not mean they *do*. That will be a relatively rare occurance.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
Actually, it is more meaningful than an absolute number - it is a &quot;power index&quot;. Yes, it would be interesting to have more data, namely regarding populational basis and how the adjustment was made (a straight %, a deflating factor, log values...). If it follows a straight % (as it is simpler and the wording leads to believe), it means that each class has a Pc% of the total population (being each Pc% = (number of [lvl 70] chars of class &quot;c&quot; / total number of [lvl 70] chars) and the sum of all the 9 Pc% = 100%) and a percentage of the arena population above a certain bracket (Ac% = number of chars of class &quot;c&quot; with arena rating at or above X/ total number of chars with arena rating at or above X). Dividing Ac by Pc you get the index. <br />
<br />
The main question is that how should population adjustment be taken into account for this, besides the &quot;catch 22&quot; already described. A better solution would probably [as sugested once by a poster and more or less included in one of the blogues that computes arena standings] be to take into account the actual distribution of a class - namely which % of the class has a rating above X and how that compares to other classes.<br />

<br />
agreed more details would be appropriate. but to assume anything outside of level 70 would be wrong on blizzard's part. i also find it hard to believe that blizzard would say, we want 50% to be warriors and 10% to be paladins, so the representation numbers we want would be changed in that sense. <br />
<br />
however you also have to take into account classes with multiple specs. warriors are arms as locks are mostly sl/sl, but shamans can be used in all 3 (hence over-rep in 5v5) or disc + shadow for priests, all 3 trees for rogues. the popularity of certain cookie cutter combos will definitely affect these numbers. the now removed but formerly proposed shaman changes probably would have increased their numbers in 2s and 3s, and i suspect holy shock changes will help paladins as well.</div></div><hr />

If you want to do well in arenas, they're setup so that you can respec, use your PvP gear, and do well, then spec back to your PvE spec and do BG's or instances in your PvE gear. Lots of people do this, and I think it's fine.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree with you there, to say that they didn't take spec into account but still thought the numbers to be accurate and helpful is silly, granted i understand why they most likely did not take the spec into account, since people respec, a warrior that is MS in arena will probably be prot when he PVE's. So the ability to generate spec numbers would have been much more difficult since you would have to take the numbers while the teams are actually in the arena's to get accurate counts of spec's. Even pvp only players will swap spec to try things out. Yes this does give them a vague outline of the actual people going into arena's but they should be able to understand how some people can be like &quot;WTF i can't believe that our numbers are that high&quot; mostly because they are a certain spec that is under represented in arena and forget about their other spec's. (enhance vs resto shaman's in 5's is a good example) (and feral/oomkin vs resto in 2's as Miranger mentioned) The problem is that when you look at a glossed over percentage you have to essentially assign a role for that class to play which blizzard has been doing for most classes in pvp lately. Either your Spec A or you're less effective that someone who is. They give people the choice to be able to customize their characters to be unique in what they choose to specialize in, but then make changes to bottleneck those choices into &quot;ok you might be a good player, but if you want to actually go anywhere in the long run, you better respec to build X or similar geared players that might not be as good as you will start to beat you since they have chosen to go with Build X (aka frost for mages, mace for rogues, resto for druids) MS warriors and SL/SL locks are pretty much the last surviving viable hybrid builds that have a major representation, but still defines them so that if you don't go the set hybrid build you're probably going to lose. Regaurdless of a class's situation, it's all the same problem, making changes that almost seem to force classes into playing a certain specific way just to accomplish something to the point that it almost feels like you're being punished if you try to deviate from those builds to find a more unique way to play.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mahtamori</div><div class="date">2008-03-06, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just for interest here is an average accross all three brackets ordered by highest to lowest:<br />
<br />
Druid 180.1%<br />
Priest 154.5%<br />
Rogue 127.0%<br />
Warlock 118.1%<br />
Warrior 100.1%<br />
Shaman 75.6%<br />
Mage 66.3%<br />
Paladin 65.5%<br />
Hunter 45.4%<br />
<br />
So the two most overpowered classes: Druid and Priest<br />
The two least powerful classes: Hunter and Paladin (with mage a close third).<br />
<br />
Other points that go against the popular perception:<br />
<br />
Rogues are more powerful than Warriors.<br />
Shamans are more powerful than Paladins.<br />
Warriors are pretty much perfectly balanced if you average the three brackets and the second most balanced class is the Warlock followed by the Shaman.<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all, excuse my truncation of the quote.<br />
<br />
Now, Kalgan's post was weighted by class popularity. What those numbers mean is that only 8.7% of the expected number of mages made it into the 2200+ rated teams in 2v2.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the numbers do not really say anything about class power, because there are so many factors involved. It can say SOMETHING about power with regards to the lower popularity classes, since often they are less popular due to powergamers and class-of-the-month followers avoiding them - so if fewer than expected make it into the 2200+...<br />
<br />
In either case, something needs to be done about the classes with the least representation. Especially for the detailed data where hidden information regarding how many of the top rated Paladins or Shamen are spec X and then target the other specs which just aren't represented.<br />
For Mages it is a bit different. Mostly because they aren't over-represented in their other two brackets.</div></div><hr />

That is increasing the complexity of the analysis, which doesn't make the balancing effort easier and presupposes that every spec should perform equaly in the arena (something that is not a given). <br />
<br />
But do you know what is funny? That those 8,7% of the mage representation in 2v2 2.2k+ are probably 100% frost.</div></div><hr />

Warriors are far and away the most popular class. Mages are second most popular. Hunters are a relatively distant third behind those two. This is all at level 70, which is all that counts for Arena…the numbers may be different if you consider all levels, though I believe Warriors are still firmly on top.</div></div><hr />
