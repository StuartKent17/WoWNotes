<br />
I know that a lot of people will love to argue with that over hundreds of replies. I would just like to add that it usually takes a lot to make me post something on the front page and I don't think I've ever been wrong everytime I did. Hopefully Blizzard will react fast enough and add tons of new masks in the next build just to pretend that it was intended. (Suggestion: Pandarens please)<br />

<br />
On a non related sidenote, I would also like to point out that the old Emerald Dream maps that have been in the game files for years have been slightly updated throughout the 3.2, and in the Build 10072 of the PTRs the Map.dbc file with some of the settings for each zone was updated to make it a 40 Players max zone. <br />

PTR Focused Testing - Northrend Beasts and Faction Champions<br />
The Northrend Beasts (Info + Loot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=74603.0)) and Faction Champions (Info (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=74632.0) / Loot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=74655.0)) encounters are being test on the US Test Realms. I will not copy the skills list once again, just check the older posts.<br />
<br />
The new items will be added to the Item Database Latest Additions Page (http://db.mmo-champion.com/latest), a compilation will be available on the front page once the testing is done. <br />
<br />
Update - I will keep the loot tables update on the itemDB for the moment, tags have been created to make the browsing easier, most of the bosses had their loot table cleaned/updated. <br />

(My comment on the previous thread about this:)<br />
<br />
One idea of the next expansion's &quot;gimmick&quot; (see: Dranaei, Blood Elves, Death Knight) might indeed be these two new races, but the gimmick being the ability to choose side, as both races are somewhat neutral in nature. For example, before you leave the starting zone of said races, you get the ability to choose either Horde or Alliance as your faction. You cannot leave the zone until you've decided, nor join any guild or be teleported out until you've chosen. Through a questchain for example.<br />
<br />
Just a thought. Also;<br />

<br />
Alright, let's see how connected Worgen are to the horde then, that would make them a viable &quot;2 sided&quot; race?<br />
<br />
Orcs - No connection at all.<br />
Trolls - ^<br />
Tauren - ^<br />
Blood elves - ^<br />
Undead - Minor conflicts in Silverpine forest.<br />
<br />
So why exactly would worgen be horde when all current information about them, both official lore and speculation (I.E. Gilneas) points them to the alliance?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This sounds plausible, considering the recent Kalgan's interview and what he said about new races. Goblins have been there since Warcraft 2, and worgen have been in the game since vanilla. Well established races, well known, liked by players. Heck, there's been whining about wishing to have worgen as playable race.<br />
<br />
This also means that if we suddenly see pandaren NPCs in the game at some point, we can be pretty sure they will be playable an expansion after :P</div></div><hr />

I think Boubouille's confidence is reasonable. There's no reason a female Worgen mask would show up if they weren't going to become a big part of the game somehow, unless it's an intentional red herring from Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's most likely that both will be neutral. There is no reason for Goblins to side with only one faction. <br />
<br />
As for the Worgen this might kill the reference to that list of future expansions as I agree with many who have posted that Gilneas with its proximity to SFK is the obvious choice of starting zone. <br />
<br />
As for Worgen origins they are not definitively Evil or good, they are simply vicious by nature. It was said at some point that on their homeworld they are in a state of permanent war with &quot;the emerald flame&quot; and many have speculated that this is just another reference to the burning legion. <br />
<br />
I kind of expected worgen as a new race after being transformed during the Shade of Arugal questline in Grizzly hills. I honestly couldnt see Bliz working that hard on a model with animations for so many attacks under player control without it being for a longer term purpose.<br />
<br />
Good news imo lets just hope they are neutral so both factions are equally satisfied.</div></div><hr />

Well it is kind of strange that if only this, they would add a female model. Female models are extraordinarily rare in this game for a non-player race. Things like broken they only half finished the female model and worgen have gotten by all this time with just being a male model (although would you really check?) I think if they were just going to be fighting the goblins they wouldn't feel a pressing need to make a female version.<br />
<br />
I like the female ones though, I'd love to play them on the Horde, so I'm hoping for the neutral faction that chooses a side to be true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Goblins as a whole will never pick a side. BUT - if a faction of goblins get thrown out of Undermine for some reason / some principality dispute, they could FEASIBLY join the horde. After all, if the goblins were truly Neutral, why not build Zepp's for the alliance?<br />
<br />
<br />
Worgen... the only, ONLY reason I can see them joining the horde is this: Gilneas is discovered to still exist, The alliance sends knights there to help them, only to find them all turned into Worgen. Still intellegent, still vital to the existence of mankind, but Worgen none the less. The knights begin a slaughter...<br />
<br />
That said though, I am betting they go alliance. Then alliance could have a tauren-sized race, and horde (with goblins) could have a gnomed size race. then everyone can stop kvetching.</div></div><hr />

But, from the look of the 'worgen' masks, the race looks oddly more feline than canine. If you look at how the male face is structured, it shares more characteristics with say, a lion, than with a wolf. The female face is another thing altogether, which looks something like a miss-match between a red panda, a fox, and a cat of some type.<br />

Nevertheless, more refugees and other nations have entreated Gilneas for aid. These unfortunates never see a Gilnean and are easy prey for the worgen that occasionally stray south from Shadowfang Keep.LoC 97 Gilneas is presumed not to have been affected by the Scourge. <br />

Before the new Alliance race for the Burning Crusade was announced there were rumors that the inhabitants of Gilneas have turned into worgen and that worgen would be the new race and Gilneas their homeland.<br />

You could also say both Goblin masks look more like Orcs without the tusks then they do look like Goblins. These things are flat, and the shape of the face is a very determining factor on how something looks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And the rest of you saying this is a rather bold move - yes, it seems to be intentionally that way.<br />
With this, there hasn't been a mask that you can't play as a race. This so-called brave assumption is pretty much the best we've got for now for logical debate. And hey, if it turns out to be wrong, at least it was something fun to discuss and post about.<br />
<br />
Personally, if the whole idea of being able to choose a faction at one point in the beginning quest chain doesn't work out, I'd have to say Goblins go to Horde and Worgen go to Alliance.<br />
Goblins have stayed neutral for their trade partnerships and probably still will after this (theoretically) happens, but there could be some that just go straight Horde because of their strong(er) affiliations.<br />
Worgens to the Alliance because it was Night Elves that summoned them to begin with - who's to say they can't be controlled / negotiated with if there are intelligent leaders? (That would really lead me to wonder what's to happen to the various Worgen camps that are for Alliance quests)<br />
<br />
I hope this actually works out. It could easily be made the new gimmick for &quot;Cataclysm&quot;, being able to choose factions at the end of the goblin/worgen quest chains.</div></div><hr />

Death Knight for both obviously<br />
Mage, Warlock, Priest and Warrior for Worgen, if you have fought against them you will have noticed those classes. I'd also guess Rogue<br />

I think they will both be neutral up to a certain level, then they will have to choose a side. I think this is why Blizzard has recently announced the &quot;Faction Change&quot; service coming.

<br />
Seriously Jiggler, dont make stupid comments when you know nothing about lore.<br />
<br />
If you ever even played WC3 you would know that Trolls and Orcs have quite a huge connection since Thrall basically saved the Trolls from the Darkspear Islands.<br />
<br />
Thrall helped save the tribe from murloc attacks and the Sea Witch — during which Sen'jin was killed. Sen'jin was granted a vision which showed that Thrall would lead the Island Trolls off the island and escape certain death. -http://www.wowwiki.com/Darkspear_tribe#History<br />
<br />
As for Draenei, you fail again.<br />
<br />
Kil'jaeden ordered the Draenei to be exterminated by the orcs through his student, the warlock Gul'dan. - http://www.wowwiki.com/Draenei<br />
<br />
Yes they don't connect but look at the choices, they either join the faction with the Horde and their old enemies (The Orcs) who slaughtered their families. Or they could side with the Alliance, who are in pretty much exactly the same posistion (The Orcs) slaughtered so many Humans, Orcs cut down the Elfs Forests, Orcs basically owned everything, so yeah... <br />
<br />
L2make constructive comments!<br />

He's not saying they would be neutral the whole way. The reason they would be confusing in PvP because you wouldn't know right away who you're walking up to. Right now I see a Troll and I know it's horde. But if I see a Worgen from far away - you're not necessarily sure right away. Not a HUGE deal, but would still cause some problems.<br />

Look at the other Halloween masks we have though. They're all based on the races. It seems even stranger that they would add 4 new masks that go against the pattern of the 20 we already have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The faction change service is being implemented because of the fact that 2 neutral races will be put into the game. These neutral races, in their beginning zones, must choose to do quests pertaining to either the alliance or the horde, and that is decided in that first zone.<br />
<br />
Because they're neutral, they need a way to allow them to change their minds and work for the other side. An added benefit is that it makes others who do not own any neutral races to participate in the faction change service, but it is intended for the goblins and worgen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While true, the goblin faces have an obvious goblin cant to their features that makes them easily identifiable. I double checked the other masks versus the other player character faces and altogether, they're a pretty close facsimile. The only odd one is the male Tauren, due to the muzzle. Obviously, the worgen/cat masks would feature a similar drawn in appearence like Tauren mask, because of the similar muzzle.<br />
<br />
But, if you compare the two, the Worgen masks still looks a little odd. As if the face is too clenched and elongated to appear canine in any form.<br />
<br />
Personally, I am all for Worgen, I just know that the existing models will require a ton of additional work to become a valid PC model.</div></div><hr />

The game has to write more lore for the next expansion, what a perfect way to start something new off by a certain tribe of goblins fighting a certain tribe of worgens, who the alliance decides to help out, and in return the goblins decide to seek help from the horde, or something along these lines. Goblins have been looked at as Horde in WC2, all their areas are located near horde settlements, and not to mention they can still keep booty bay and rachet sanctuary, just make up a new goblin tribe, think about the many different trolls. I am not excellent at old lore, but i know for a fact theres a city in Eastern Kingdoms that is supposdley being overrun by Worgen, could it be these Humans where transformed into worgens and want to continue to fight along side the alliance. <br />

Have you looked at draenei lore PreBC? Was there ever any hint at all that Draenei would be a viable alliance race?<br />
<br />
No, there wasn't. Which is why some serious retconning took place and the race was MADE viable. Blizzard retcons things when it suits them.<br />
<br />
Also, name all of the other hallow's end masks that Blizzard has made that hasn't been an alliance or horde mask. I'll sit right here and wait. What was that? 0? You mean that all of the masks currently are only based on playable races?!<br />
<br />
Here's what I want to know. If they honestly were going to add more &quot;ghoulish&quot; masks, why would they make a female worgen, if that is indeed a worgen, when absolutely 0 exist current in the game? And why not add more than 2 races, if they're just monster's faces?<br />
<br />
This honestly is as significant a find in terms of what the next expansion will hold as that directory with the word northrend was back in BC. There were plenty of naysayers then too, that northrend would NOT be the next expansion... and BAM, we get WotLK.</div></div><hr />

And on the subject of neutrality: it won't happen. Blizzard has explicitly stated that they want to keep to Horde and Alliance easily distinguished. <br />
<br />
<br />
You understand that they would just be &quot;called&quot; neutral, where in fact they must complete a quest chain to exit their starting zone and choose either alliance or horde. Which is why the faction change service is such an important thing.</div></div><hr />

For example, before you leave the starting zone of said races, you get the ability to choose either Horde or Alliance as your faction. You cannot leave the zone until you've decided, nor join any guild or be teleported out until you've chosen. Through a questchain for example.<br />
<br />
<br />
More than likely, you'll have a choice between a Goblin (Alliance) and a Goblin (Horde), similar to creating a Death Knight in WotLK (who were all technically part of the Scourge, regardless of their race); even though Alliance Goblins share the same starting zone as Horde Goblins, you won't be able to interact.<br />

That would be far simpler than trying to create a third faction for Goblins and/or Worgen and allowing them to shift to Horde or Alliance.</div></div><hr />

The Night Elves originally saw the Draenei as Eredar, and distrusted them, even with the Draenei's offers of friendship. A series of quests in the starting zones proves to the Night Elves that they are not, or allied with, the Eredar. <br />

Its more likely than not tbh.<br />
<br />
In the actual game heres what is happening - <br />
<br />
Humans Kill humans<br />
Forsaken kill scourge<br />
Death Knights kill scourge (and fight against each other as horde or alliance)<br />
Belfs killed Kaelthas<br />
Dragonkin kill dragonkin<br />
<br />
In other parts of the game - <br />
<br />
Taurens and Night Elfs peacefully watch over Cenarius together<br />
<br />
<br />
Theres EVERY possibility that worgens and goblins can be neutral from 1-20 then decide to take a path to the horde or alliance.<br />
<br />
Its Blizzards game, they make the lore up as they go along :)<br />

I think both Worgen and Goblins are capable of being a &quot;neutral&quot; race, which either chooses to side with alliance or horde near the end of it's &quot;starter chain&quot;. At current, we only have a race selection list of Alliance Races and Horde Races. What's to prevent Blizzard from adding a selection list for &quot;Neutral Races&quot; ? At the end of the starter chain, you choose you allegiance, and the character is modified to only have access to that factions AH, chat channels etc.</div></div><hr />

Then again I guess this is a nice way to generate some more traffic to the website.<br />
<br />
Now to provide some counter arguments for this hastily drawn conclusion:<br />
I could see some goblin faction allying themselves with the horde but I can't see either faction joining the alliance.<br />
<br />
Goblins:<br />
They might be neutral but they have no real ties to the alliance, at least they used to be employed by the horde which in some small way ties them together.<br />
Additionally, the horde needs goblins because they don't have their own mechanically inclined race but the alliance already has gnomes meaning they have no need for goblins.<br />
Additionally, the alliance has a sizeable fleet of it's own whereas I could see the horde in need of naval support.<br />
(assuming for a second that the new expansion will actually be the Maelstrom as the hype suggests)<br />
<br />
Worgen:<br />
Though they are somewhat tied to the alliance (scythe of elune) they're not really an alliance race.<br />
Simply put, the worgen are monsters, some of them might have been human once but so were the forsaken.<br />
I don't think any alliance race (the humans least of all) would accept the worgen into their ranks, especially with xenophobic Varian Wrynn at the helm.<br />
<br />
My bet is that those masks are either for a quest or we might be seeing goblins and worgen as neutral npc factions at some point.<br />
(though I find the worgen as a neutral faction almost as far fetched as I find the idea of them joining the alliance)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Goblins as a whole will never pick a side. BUT - if a faction of goblins get thrown out of Undermine for some reason / some principality dispute, they could FEASIBLY join the horde. *<br />
After all, if the goblins were truly Neutral, why not build Zepp's for the alliance?<br />

Would you hire mercenaries to do your trade routes, if you have a own naval fleet to take care of that ? No, you would not.<br />

Frankly i never thought they would evolve beyond the ones in duskwood, silverpine and ashenvale, lowbie wolfmen that are the focus around a few short questlines. If these weren't going to be a new race then why choose them? We've never seen a female worgen before, plus i concur this is a good explanation of why blizzard is removing the worgen pet. <br />
<br />
The confusion I'm experiencing is why so much focus around worgen now? they have bigs roles in howling fjord and REALLY big parts in grizzly hills (several towns, a few elites and the strange return of arugal) and now there's suspicions of a new race for them? plus, its not like if an orc walks up they're neutral, they're hostile to everyone, despite the lore, goblins on the other hand are a huge faction and offer hundreds of quests. <br />
<br />
Conclusion: The goblins seem like a very fair new race, the worgen seem iffy</div></div><hr />

Gilneas, the starting location for the Worgen(debatable) had joined the alliance in the second war. They were humans after all, but they did however seperate themselves from everyone during the third war. Jaina Proudmore also managed to get some recruits from Guilneas to join her during the third war, nothing i've read ties Gilneas to the Horde. <br />
<br />
During the period of the end of the second war to current, it is very likely that a stray worgen had wandered into gilneas and infected the city. But having no ties to Arugal led to them redeveloping a culture and eventually realizing their background and ties, to the alliance. Blah blah blah make peace BAM new playable race for the alliance.<br />
<br />
Goblins is an obvious race addition to the horde, King Varian Wyrnn HATES greenskins - this more than likely applies to more than just orcs. Not to mention the countless services that Goblins offer to Horde only (i.e. Zepps) <br />
<br />
Worgen is still debateable, but Goblins is a given.<br />
<br />
Neutrality is out of the question, even if they choose. - Blizzard has problems with cross faction language, Undead used to able to speak Common but due to trash talk via PvP it was changed.</div></div><hr />

(My comment on the previous thread about this:)<br />
<br />
One idea of the next expansion's &quot;gimmick&quot; (see: Dranaei, Blood Elves, Death Knight) might indeed be these two new races, but the gimmick being the ability to choose side, as both races are somewhat neutral in nature. For example, before you leave the starting zone of said races, you get the ability to choose either Horde or Alliance as your faction. You cannot leave the zone until you've decided, nor join any guild or be teleported out until you've chosen. Through a questchain for example.<br />
<br />
Just a thought. Also;<br />

GJ you toolFirst off, bother check and fully read the links, Nethaera posts only indicates of not adding the race... during this expansion. So why would it not be able to be added in the next expansion, is that completely impossible? Also, read this:<br />

Could it be possible that Blizzard is updating the textures on races? I mean, new kitty + bear form is happening in 3.2, it wouldn't be farfetched to think about the possibilities of them simply updating character models. <br />
<br />
2. On the subject of choosing sides, with the Alliance and the Horde, it doesn't matter if they are the same race, if they are allied to the other side, they are the enemy. The whole idea of choosing a side makes sense then, its where your allegiances lie and stuff of the sort. I can't really provide an example, but the High Elves are allied to the Alliance, and the Blood Elves are allied to the Horde, they are still of the same race, but different names and different feelings on magic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MusikDisaster</div><div class="date">2009-07-17, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i agree that this is offical .. and verynice find..<br />
<br />
The reasons they will do this are as follows..<br />
<br />
<br />
This update is timed with emerald dream update so its clearly expansion content.<br />
<br />
this update matches chinas anoyance and rejection of pandaren as a playable/killable race (yes this is real they use to be in game files when BWL was added but where removed beacuse people where model swapping them and killing pandas is iligal even iligal vertal / artform act in china.<br />
<br />
this update matches the need for a more anamalistic (furry race) for aliance.. (will pull heaps of new second life players to wow.<br />
<br />
Makes senses with emeral dream expansion (goblins want to go plunder the emerald dream worgen want to join with druids and research about their origins)..<br />
<br />
I personal will be rolling a wargen + what ever new hero class they add.. (if they do)... which i dout actualy<br />
<br />
i think for the next fue expantions a<br />
<br />
<br />
Dubble race - hero class - dubble race - hero class... paturn can be expected<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Im really looking forward to playing a wargen<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also note the fact that GoBLINS are heaps lamer than wargen welll it will be a counter to all the ALiance players that will switch to horde once they add that feature in 3.2 or 3.3.. HEAPS will<br />
<br />
with the adition of wargen aliance numbers will rise.. (beacuse lets face it once they add Faction swapping.. it will switch to prob 2:1 horde to aliance easy.)<br />
<br />
<br />
WARGEN ROCK<br />

The textures are brand new. Take a look at the facial detail and the very fact that they're in M/F. Blizzard would not take the time on these models if they didn't deem it necessary. If they were just making Halloween masks, they would just use models already in-game. Take a look at 3.2 and the T-9 models. I happen to to think many of them aren't that bad and the expansion, overall, will have a lot in store. However, it's very clear they're diverting the majority of their resources into 3.3 and away from 3.2. These masks show definite and significant signs of something to come... mark Boub's words.</div></div><hr />

Goblins as hordes doesn't make any sense. I mean Gadgetzan? Booty Bay? Those places would no longer be available to alliance - but yeah, blizzard are the kind of people that would throw a regurgitated reason like &quot;the goblins there are of a different kind&quot; to force their sold-out ideas. Plus those pests doesn't fit horde physolophy very well... the only beings those guys can smash are gnomes and maybe the dwarves.<br />
<br />
Worgen as alliance... well lets just say that its maybe because of Varian. (I think thats how its spelled - the new king guy) Because let's face it, if the little boy were still the alliance king, then worgen would be pretty much out of the window right now... but the new king looks as savage as a worgen so it doesn't surprise me that he would make such a decision.</div></div><hr />

Lorewise it makes sense for Goblins to join the Horde not as a whole but as a Cartel, Worgen in the Alliance makes sense to the Night Elf who used the Scythe of Elune says in the quest that she sensed that they were bestial but not evil.</div></div><hr />

&quot;NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondly,<br />
<br />
<br />
Plans can, yes, they are straying away from making hallows end masks only being from playable races.<br />
<br />
Lore cannot, and should not. Imagine how you would feel if Arthas suddenly became a good guy out of nowhere with some hack reasoning. It'd be stupid. Or if the burning legion became a playable race. Stop being so dumb.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just because lore should not change doesn't mean that Blizzard won't do it anyways. As utterly retarded as it would be for the Worgen (that we know of) to join the orderly Alliance, and as much as it would hurt the Goblin's potential profits and reputation if a whole bunch of them joined the Horde, Blizzard has been known to slaughter their own lore for things that would be &quot;cool.&quot;</div></div><hr />

You know nothing of the new lore.<br />
<br />
Blizzard retconned the old draenei lore when BC was released. <br />
<br />
About 21,000 years ago, Sargeras, the Destroyer of Worlds, approached the eredar race, telling them that he was impressed by their work. He offered the three leaders of the eredar — Archimonde, Kil'jaeden, and Velen — untold power in exchange for their loyalty. Soon after, Velen then had a vision dictating the creation of the Burning Legion and its aftermath. He warned Kil'jaeden and Archimonde about this but they did not heed his warning. Instead, hungry for the power they could gain, they accepted Sargeras' offer. Many willing Eredar were transformed, but a faction of uncorrupted Eredar led by Velen fled their homeworld of Argus, calling themselves the &quot;Draenei&quot; (&quot;the Exiled Ones&quot;). For thousands of years, they wandered the universe exploring dozens of worlds. Each time they found a home, however, the Burning Legion would be upon them. After traveling through much of the cosmos, they finally found a safe world which they called Draenor (&quot;Exile's Refuge&quot;).</div></div><hr />

They are the exact same race. Velen was Kil'jaeden and Archimonde best pal before Sargeras. The three ruled the Eredar. The only reason why Velen and the Draenei escaped was because Velen saw the future.</div></div><hr />

Gilneas, the starting location for the Worgen(debatable) had joined the alliance in the second war. They were humans after all, but they did however seperate themselves from everyone during the third war. Jaina Proudmore also managed to get some recruits from Guilneas to join her during the third war, nothing i've read ties Gilneas to the Horde. <br />
<br />
During the period of the end of the second war to current, it is very likely that a stray worgen had wandered into gilneas and infected the city. But having no ties to Arugal led to them redeveloping a culture and eventually realizing their background and ties, to the alliance. Blah blah blah make peace BAM new playable race for the alliance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they are inplented, than im wondering about some other things (also dosnt rly matter, but its fun to fantasise about :P)<br />
<br />
first: classes<br />
<br />
for goblins i would think, atleast warlocks, mages, rogues, warriors, death knight, maybe priest? and maybe a new hero class :D<br />
<br />
for the worgen i think it would be something like, warlocks, mages, priest, rogues, warriors, maybe hunter, and ofc, also, maybe a new hero class ^^<br />
<br />
second: mounts<br />
<br />
i must admit i dont know much about the lore of the goblins and worgen, so what i say is prob bullsht<br />
<br />
for goblins it might be something mechanic just like gnomes, but then ofc not a bird, but something way cooler like a cat or wolf or something<br />
and for worgen wolves would be obvious, but that would be kinda weird wolves riding on wolves, also since orcs already have wolfs, so bears maybe? i rly dont have a clue<br />
<br />
third: racials<br />
<br />
goblins might have something with engineering, but ofc goblins already have that, so that would be kinda dubble, maybe something with explosives (because of demolition squad from WC2)<br />
worgen would be nice to have something like dash, like a sprint but then for all races, and maybe a howl, that buffs ap for raid group.<br />
<br />
and last: char customisation<br />
<br />
for goblins there isnt rly that much to customize, females can have there hair changed, but males dont have any, so maybe something with there ears, ofc the skin tone, maybe some facial rings, and ofc there face.<br />
<br />
for worgen you also have the fur tone, and the face, fangs maybe<br />

While thats true, doesnt it seem to break the logic of goblins? Cause then technicaly BB, Gaz, Ratchet, and Everlook would be horde towns. That def wont change. It's not like goblins have different clans. Then again we do have goblins guarding our zep towers who wtfpwn ally players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the easiest change?:<br />
1. Make new playable races<br />
or<br />
2. Make masks not just for playable races?<br />
<br />
If you like the first one more, it doesn't make it more likely than the second one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They look more like cat-people (Rakshasa/Khajeet) rather than wolf-people.</div></div><hr />

Nope, they have different cartels, just like the one that joined the Horde during the Second War.<br />
<br />
Of course it's not all goblins that will join the Horde, but just one cartel. Speculation speaking.</div></div><hr />

Worgens are like werewolfs, and goblins are just ugly scary lil guys.<br />
<br />
Obviously good halloween mask choices are for halloween. There even labeled halloween.<br />
What would this have todo with a new race for the xpansion.<br />
<br />
He made logic conclusion, last time you got masks of all of races which are included in game(human, orcs, undead etc) taking in consideration also that blizzard sometimes rush too much in preparation. Implementation of 2 new masks in game event which have as i said races masks can mean big chance that blizzard is having on mind them as new races for playing.<br />
Btw, im not so big excitment guy when expansions are in question but wanted to explain this fuzz alitle.</div></div><hr />

Yes. And as B said in his post, it wouldn't be a big issue if they had placed just goblins textures in for hallows end. But to suddenly decide to add Worgen textures? Some of the Hallow's end stuff can turn you into a goblin, but worgen have never been associated with Hallow's end. Not to mention that the leader of the vicious worgen (arugal) was convientiently killed off during WotLK, leaving only the normal worgen, who are 'bestial but not evil' to wander about. If blizzard had just wanted to add some newer mask textures, they probably would have added Goblin/panderan/kobold/murloc/gnoll/furbolg/ghoul etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dalaran is not a human city, it is a mage city. Mages qualifying as any race that can wield magic in its accepted forms. Thus, most mage-compatible races are represented in Dalaran. <br />
The exception is, of course, the Blood Elves, whom had to be allowed into the Kirin Tor's select group.</div></div><hr />

Im starting to see a patter in Blizzard: whenever Blizzard puts clues of something new, players make speculations, and Blizzard stays quiet. Time passes and Blizzard finally reveals that the obvious speculations are correct.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has a tendency to overlook things, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Who the hell said just making textures was a big deal? As I said in my post, which you would know if you had read it, it wouldn't have been a big deal if it was just goblin textures. It would even be normal. Blizzard added the new broom mounts in July before they first appeared in Hallow's end that year. The fact that they picked Worgen out of no where, and beyond that, the fact that they introduced the concept of -female- worgen, says that it probably isn't just a random new mask texture.</div></div><hr />

The days before the Draenei announcement were wierd. Eveyone saying &quot;Yes, it will be the Draenei, not, it will not!&quot; and then we saw a picture of an Eredar Paladin... :p</div></div><hr />

you can tell by the facial expression of the female worgen that she looks nice (alliance) i mean look how much detail is in her face, it just wouldnt be for straight up NPC's</div></div><hr />
