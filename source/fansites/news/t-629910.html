[EU] Valentine Contest!<br />
Love is in the air and the sighs of lovers creates a mist of romance all over Azeroth. That can only mean one thing: Valentine's Day is near! To get into the spirit of the occasion, we are hosting a Valentine Card Contest. To participate in the Valentine Card Contest, simply design a Valentine Card showing your love for World of Warcraft and you could win a Gurky key!<br />
<br />
You can learn more about this contest at our Valentine Contest page. http://www.wow-europe.com/en/contests/valentine2009/ (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/contests/valentine2009/)<br />
<br />
You should also read the Terms and Conditions for this contest. http://www.wow-europe.com/en/legal/contests/valentine-09.html (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/legal/contests/valentine-09.html)<br />

Blue posts<br />
&quot;Mandatory&quot; Talents<br />
There is nothing wrong with &quot;mandatory&quot; talents per se. Generally the community considers them mandatory because they are very good talents. We don't want a bunch of trees with a bunch of mediocre talents. We love the depth that comes from players endlessly debating which spec to use or comparing talents to each other.<br />
<br />
Where it crosses the line in when it starts to restrict player options too much. It's okay if almost all warriors take Cruelty and slightly less okay if almost all warlocks take Ruin. If there was a 31-point talent that all specs took, then it starts to hurt the other two trees in that class. Cookie-cutter specs are okay when they are something used by players who are new to a class and don't want to spend the energy just yet learning every nuance of the class. Ideally, there are a few points that come down to player preference. As an example, before Lich King the three tanking classes had very choices in their talents -- they needed to spend almost all their points just on mitigation.<br />
<br />
The extreme alternative is something where every talent tree is equally viable. That might sound good in theory, but it makes the discussions a lot less interesting. &quot;What's the best talent build for a Balance druid who wants to do 5-mans and Arenas?&quot; &quot;It doesn't matter, dude. Just take whatever and you'll do fine.&quot;<br />
<br />
So we usually land somewhere in the middle -- talents that you pretty much are always going to have, mixed in with some that come down to player preference. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318914393-whats-so-wrong-with-mandatory-talents.html))<br />
<br />
Differences between talent specs<br />
We like the way the death knight's talent trees are shaping up. Specifically, you can tank using good builds from any of the three trees. One may be slightly higher than another at any given moment in time, but overall the goal is that they are very similar and they are certainly more similar than the other three tanking classes.<br />
<br />
We can totally imagine a world in which Arms, Fury and Protection all can tank using different styles. The Prot tree would just be more about sword and board style than tanking per se. Perhaps an Arms warrior would tank with a two-hander more like a DK does. I'm not saying we will 100% for sure go down that road, but it is interesting idea to think about.<br />
<br />
It's harder with druids and paladins because some of the other trees can heal or are ranged. (You could probably come up with a Ret tanking system). Being able to tank and heal effectively with<br />
<br />
To some extent druids are always going to be about being able to fill very different roles. While a DK tank might have a Frost tanking build and Blood tanking build that she switches between, I don't know that you would see many druid tanks switching between Bear build #1 and Bear build #2. Some will, and that's cool. But I suspect a lot of them will swap from bear to cat or from bear to Resto.<br />
<br />
I could easily see a Prot warrior who wants two different Prot tanking builds -- a high threat build vs. a high survivability build for example. I could see a Prot warrior who wants a Prot tanking build vs. a Prot off-tanking build or even a Prot PvP build.<br />
<br />
But I don't think this feature automatically locks us into Prot = tanking and Arms / Fury = dps if we don't want it to be. There is a risk that it allows us to be lazy: &quot;Oh don't worry about making Frost mages PvE viable because they can always swap specs to Fire or Arcane for PvE.&quot; We would still like to get away from X being &quot;the PvP tree&quot; for every class. Likewise we'd like to get away from having tanking trees too, but it's harder or perhaps impossible for some classes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14318633859-blizzard-i-think-dual-spec-is-a-bad-idea.html))<br />
<br />
Spells and Talents budget<br />
We have budgets for the power of individual spells and talents. We do not budget based on the total number of abilities available -- some classes just have more than others.<br />
<br />
I would also call the budgets a guideline. You have to know when to change the numbers on something even if the budget suggests that will be overpowered or underpowered.<br />
<br />
To be metaphysical for a minute, you can't define the universe with one gigantic equation. There are just too many variables. You can use simpler equations to attempt to describe small parts of things as long as you understand their limitations. A great deal of your success in WoW, perhaps even more in PvP than PvE, is your skill in using your abilities and that is a hard thing to model.

Threat Generation<br />
We're looking at the issue since players have brought it up. However, we are not hearing widespread feedback from across the board that DKs are struggling to maintain single-target threat. That is what makes me wonder if something else is going on, like it only occurs with some gear choices for example. <br />
<br />
If I am summarizing this thread, it appears most of the concern is about single-target threat vs. well-geared dps, especially against slow-swinging or magic-using bosses who don't proc Rune Strike as often. Groups with reliable BoSanc don't notice the problem as much.<br />
<br />
I would compare yourself to warriors more than paladins, since the next patch removes the threat of Light, which sometimes grants paladins crazy numbers. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14287008802-dk-threat--not-going-away.html))<br />

Improved Faerie Fire<br />
I am saying the tooltip, which currently reads: Your Faerie Fire spell also increases the chance the target will be hit by spell attacks by 3%, and increases the critical strike chance of your damage spells by 3% on targets afflicted by Faerie Fire.<br />
<br />
Should probably read: Your Faerie Fire and Feral Faerie Fire spells also increase the chance the target will be hit by spell attacks by 3%, and increase the critical strike chance of your damage spells by 3% on targets afflicted by your Faerie Fire or Feral Faerie Fire.<br />
<br />
One of the issues we are currently discussing is what to do in the case where someone chooses a talent that they end up not using because someone else in the group also has the same buff of equal or greater potency. To be fair though this is not a new problem. Raids always had to manage buffs like Spirit or Kings that were talented. I think groups usually worked around that by just grouping with the same people a lot and making sure someone had the talent. We are seeing a lot more raids pugged these days, and in any case, you often still want the buff when you are soloing. It is something we're discussing.

Pet hapiness<br />
In a world without pet loyalty, we feared that letting pets instantly jump to your level would make them truly disposable. When it was time for your raid or Arena you could just literally grab a pet, buy talent points, and you'd be good to go. The hunter pet is supposed to be a buddy, your loyal companion, and as such some kind of investment, not the closest bear, dinosaur or spider you could find.<br />
<br />
It could be that our fears were not a big deal in the long run, but that was our logic for keeping pet leveling.<br />
<br />
It is also slightly fun to have a few more milestones pop up after you've earned your last level, but by far this was a secondary concern. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14287259458-hunter-pets-still-a-pain.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/priest.jpg Priest (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=640) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?priest))<br />
Priest role<br />
We designed the priest to have lots of different tools. That in and of itself can be very powerful. You can fill lots of different roles in a group and switch from role to role very easily. While some tools (Renew and Flash Heal for example) are very reminiscent of spells from other classes, other tools (Prayer of Mending and Guardian Spirit) really have no direct equivalent.<br />
<br />
I think the &quot;not as powerful&quot; clause gets invoked sometimes because if priests were better at hots than druids etc. then people start to wonder why they should ever bring the other classes. I realize you can turn that argument around, but still the flexibility needs to count for something. We do not view priests as weakened versions of the other classes either in the way we design them or in practice.<br />
<br />
All that said, I do hear a lot of priests saying that they want to be really good at something and I do hear a lot of priests saying they want more tools that are more interesting and not just equivalent versions of other classes' spells. We get this message loud and clear. It's certainly something we will keep in mind as we sit down to work on the priest for 3.1 and beyond.

Pet health improvements in 3.0.8<br />
The changes we got in for 3.0.8 (aside from some general bug fixes) were mostly designed to help locks survive longer in PvP. I don't think you have all of the changes yet -- for instance we very recently juiced up pet health for some pets. I start to lose track of which changes are on the PTR versus changes we've announced that you haven't seen yet versus changes we haven't announced. Once 3.0.8 ships this will all be a lot clearer. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318914384-a-clarification-on-warlock-buffs.html))<br />
<br />
Plans for the warlock in future patches<br />
For 3.1 we are probably going to make some larger changes to the class. I still don't want to oversell these. A popular yet cynical phrase among players is that their class needs to be rebuilt from the ground up (though I see this with probably every class, which is slightly amusing). We are not deleting the warlock and starting over. We are not doing that with any class and probably never will. We do want to smooth out some rough edges of the class though. A few things that I have said we want to look at are:<br />
<br />
1) Improve deep Demonology for PvP and PvE.<br />
2) Make Affliction feel less dependent on dot timers and other external mods (nothing wrong with the mods -- we just think it's getting harder and harder to play the spec with the default UI).<br />
3) Take a hard look at Soul Shards.<br />
4) Take a hard look at the way pets scale. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318914384-a-clarification-on-warlock-buffs.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warrior.jpg Warrior (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=600) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br />
Titan's Grip<br />
It's a very good talent. While normally we like for talents to be of roughly the same power, in the case of Titan's Grip, we understand how huge it is and are willing to balance Fury around it. We don't relly think TG will be an optional talent as we design most talents to be. At the moment we're okay with that. <br />
<br />
[...] I wouldn't characterize it as sacrificing our design philosophy. We have guidelines, but we also need to be able to skirt around those guidelines sometimes. That is one of the things that makes the classes and talents interesting. In a world where everything was truly equivalent, you also risk the choices being a lot less interesting. Sometimes the exceptions are the most interesting. (E.g. History tends to most celebrate those battles that were upsets, not those where the expected party indeed triumphed.)<br />
<br />
There is certainly a risk that every spec will argue for their version of Titan's Grip. What players will need to remember is that we won't take a spec at 100% and give them a talent that adds 20% to that. If we add a talent that is a 20% boost (I am just making up numbers for illustrative purposes), the class will be balanced at 80% and we will assume everyone has the talent.<br />
<br />
We assume all Fury warriors (at higher level) dual-wield two-handed weapons, just like we assume all Affliction warlocks are casting a lot of dots. By contrast, we do not assume that all hunters use bows or that all Demo warlocks use Felguards all the time.<br />
<br />
It's an unusual talent, but in this case we feel it needs to be unusual to make it work. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318773385-are-the-devs-going-oops-with-titans-grip.html))</div></div><hr />

If they refuse to do that, then there's no reason to spec in any tree over prot for tanking because prot won't force you to eat GCDs just to use them.<br />
<br />
The major problem with non-prot tanking is that all our good tanking skills are deep into prot and/or require a shield to be fully utilized. Fury is also pretty meh for tanking despite being able to use a 2h+Shield combo because unlike Arms, they don't have a high threat output talent like Unrelenting Assault. Until they change that, blizz won't be seeing arms or fury tanks in serious raids.</div></div><hr />

More interestingly, how did this become the main topic of the thread? * Conjecture is fun but also pointless. *:P<br />
<br />
Anyway, delayed 3.0.8 means 1 week to try out my OP Illustration of the Dragon Soul before its nerfed.* * But also it means no new cool Fireball and Blizzard Graphics. :( <br />
<br />
In regards to the Titan's Grip post, I find it interesting they don't mention Arcane Barrage as an exception to their &quot;required talent&quot; rule. Because the entire spec is balanced around all Arcane mages having Arcane Barrage, both for PvE and PvP.

I know I'm probably reading too much into it, but it's rather contradictory of them.<br />
<br />
And I don't quite understand the purpose of anything other than DK multitanking. It's a nice idea, but..why not just roll an actual specc that does the job the best, the way it's supposed to, rather than gimping yourself?<br />
<br />
I understand it's meant to be 'FUN OVER EVERYTHING ELSE' but it's not fun if you're underperforming just for your own entertainment/benefit.<br />
<br />
Or I could just be a crabby bastard that everyone disagrees with and is completely wrong about everything.<br />
<br />
Edit: I thought the discussion was similar. I read that post yesterday and lol'd at the idiot that wanted to raid seriously using Arms, and said he should just go roll a DK if he wanted to do their job.</div></div><hr />

I rolled a DK just to tank, so I guess I'm not in my right mind. I had a choice of either starting a tank a level 1 or starting a tank at level 55, which is the no brainer? I was pleasantly surprised to find the DK such a fun class to play.</div></div><hr />

The end of that statement was &quot;for the time being&quot; about Titan's Grip. Maybe I am very cynical, but that tells me that they will probably end up screwing TG in the pooch in a future update, they just don't have an alternative plans for Fury yet.

Why would girls enjoy valentines day in WoW with every geek within 10 miles hitting on them? Even if their boyfriend plays WoW with them aren't they better off doing something other than playing WoW that day?<br />
<br />
<br />
Valentine's day is something for everyone to enjoy..... whether your male or female. Even if the proposed population is male your doing quests and handing them to npcs for the majority anyway so what does it matter.<br />

Back on Topic: The Warlock changes are a good start... ill monitor the PTR to see if they continue in the right track. If they do I may have to dust off my old warlock and get to shadowbolting again.</div></div><hr />

Both of my lvl 80 characters are awaiting new patch to go live - Elemental Shaman (obvious reasons) and Tanking Paladin (to get wonderful meta &amp; blue socket into his tanking helm).<br />
<br />
I just hate this. I love the idea of Elemental Shaman, I was in love with this spec from the very day I started playing it and with two months of WotLK NOTHING was done to improve its DPS (the most crappy one in the game). What the hell are developers doing? Every week I feel just like a half of raider just because I've chosen wrong spec for my class, not because I put less effort in our progress. It makes me feel bad and I think all Elemental Shaman community feels the same. Give us some hotfix or just make 3.0.8 go live and finally let us DPS like typical DPSers can...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's one of the weakest, if not the weakest, class for PvE dps in top end - being the only class reliably below 5k if you parse the top end segments of all classes on WWS. How do you manage this equation, pray tell?<br />
<br />
And they are nerfing survivability in PvP, so stop being so... frustrated?... about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I rolled a DK to tank, and I am now tanking Naxx-25 for my guild. You couldn't be more wrong :)<br />
<br />
The class is new, and as such needs tweaks. Single-target threat is a bit low with Unholy and they're looking at that. Did you really need to throw a tantrum over one little line?<br />
<br />
Also, to the guy above me-- Death Strike should generate the most threat? Should probably look at your rotation, you should -never- use DS in a raid. We tank by doing damage, and nothing but DnD has a threat modifier. The more damage, the more threat. Obliterate will net you around 4 times the amount of threat that DS will.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dooudad</div><div class="date">2009-01-13, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its now now only 2.5 hours tell servers should be up, and no patch upon logg in, likely not going to be a patch day to me *shrug* and i want the patch!!!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vallos</div><div class="date">2009-01-13, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are incorrect-- Rune Strike does not currently have a threat modifier. The only ability in the game for a DK is Death and Decay. Whenever they decide to release the next patch, then Rune Strike will have a 150% threat modifier, even though its DPS is significantly reduced.<br />
<br />
Also, it's not happening. There's no reason to make Death Strike a straight-up TPS ability, because that goes against the new tanking mechanics. We tank by doing damage, that is what the DK is. Blizzard has stated again and again that they want to move past the old days where we were just there to soak damage and do absolutely no DPS. It wasn't fun at all-- and that's the direction you want to move.<br />
<br />
Hope you understood that time :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nym</div><div class="date">2009-01-13, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading through this post and reading the Blue Mandatory Talent Post I began to think about what would the purpose of mandatory talents be for example as a Mage you used to have to talent into IceBlock. This ability was mandatory talent but the more blizzard realized it was a necessity to the class they changed it to be a trainable spell. <br />
<br />
Blizzard said Titan Grip is a must for a DPS warrior. A &quot;Mandatory&quot; Talent so why not just make it an ability learned at the trainer at its perspective level with were it was located on the talent tree and replace it with something that is a good option for DPS but isnt required to DPS.<br />
<br />
For me Talents are something that should better abilities you already have or aid personal stats. When spells were added to the mix there not talents they are spells I have to talent to get to.<br />
<br />
For example if a mage had all of its talent-able Spells such as blast wave deep freeze arcane barrage all at there disposal i would feel more like a mage for the fact that i had so many spells to choose from. You would think it would be Op but again you have to spec into the certain talent tree you wish to amplify. Arcane Barrage is good but if your specd into frost the spells not going to have near the kick that it did when you are specd into arcane but it still gives your the option of using that spell. <br />
<br />
Anyway just my two-cents while servers are down</div></div><hr />

Change no one to only reflect yourself. Stop thinking you talk for all players and all players that play dks. I have a friend that rerolled DK mostly to tank.<br />
<br />
Also, the DK is doing just fine in dps unless played by an absolute idiot that has no clue how to gear, spec, rotate abilities. So, I'm not sure what issues you are whining about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you care to elaborate on this? Why do you feel that gay men and women stay away from WoW? I think that gay men are almost drawn to an on-line world because it is one place where they are judged on their skills and creativity instead of on their orientation. Add that to the amount of free time most gay men have (most don't have family obligations to worry about) and you have an even greater argument about gay men playing MMOs at a highly disproportionate rate. <br />

Because all girls are never single? They all only play because their boyfriends do? I guess girls are still not supposed to play video games unless they do so only to please their man. What version of a 1950s world do you live in?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They crush casters but get destroyed by an melee class including protection warriors and protection paladins. That hardly makes them overpowered unless you are going up against them as a team that is caster only, and they are already looking at the issues with dks having the ability to basically lock out casters. Apparently, they only want rogues to roll over casters now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not at all what Blizzard has stated. Blizzard has stated that Titan Grip is &quot;mandatory&quot; for FURY warriors. They said that they would balance the FURY tree around it. They never said anything about arms warriors. The argument could be made that arms needs to be buffed to be on the same level as fury for pvp, but the argument isn't that Titan's Grip (an already powerful talent) should just be a freely trainable ability that arms warriors can suddenly pick up and most likely do more damage with then fury currently does.</div></div><hr />

Additionally, i find that a rotation with death and decay in it puts me at 2-4k tps which is usually enough for the gear level i'm at. My main is my resto shaman which I've already cleared all the content on, but I've only done some of 10 naxx on my dk tank and as such, I'm not required to put out any AMAZING tps. I find death and decay rotations with death strike and pestilence/blood strike do just fine for any variation of aoe/single target pulls and the like. I'm unholy specced and I didn't spec into scourge strike for this reason: it seems that death strike does just fine tps because of the self-healing as well as the sufficient damage. Healing does threat and it also helps out with keeping me up. I'm doing threat and helping heals at the same time- don't you think that's pretty good? Also, maybe if you're DW'ing i could see threat problems arising from initial threat. Honestly, no matter how much damage scourge strike/obliterate and what not do, death and decay threat is VERY good plus its aoe so it can pick up adds and anything else. (unholy tanking ftw, peace)</div></div><hr />

Erm surely you have noticed the disproportionate number of males playing compared to females? The reason girls don't play wow as much is because they aren't into fighting games half as much as guys. The same would go for any gay guy I ever met, they weren't into the macho crap.<br />
<br />
Single or not, internet nerd attention tends not to be the most exciting or flattering for girls. For a start, there is the huge one sidedness of it, a large number of guys clamouring for the attention of a very few females. Thats a sad situation, not at all romantic as Valentine's Day is meant to be. Not to mention the lack of finesse or any respect that many internet romeos display.<br />
<br />
And I said even if they are playing with their boyfriend referring to the fact that thats all this valentines crap is good for, boyfriends and girlfriends who play together. There was no implication that girls play only with their boyfriends, don't read things that aren't there. Boyfriends and girlfriends who do happen to play together have many better ways to celebrate valentines day than on WoW. Boyfriends and girlfriends who play together are a teeny tiny minority anyway, and most of this valentine shit is just between young males. With a distinct lack of females, it just becomes a desperate display. And slightly disturbing.</div></div><hr />
