The Brood Mother Returns<br />
After years of lurking in her lair battling the many brave adventurers who travelled from afar to challenge her, Onyxia returns stronger than before to commemorate World of Warcraft’s five-year anniversary.<br />
<br />
Onyxia has been scaled to offer new challenges to level 80 players and is now available for testing in 10- and 25-player modes.<br />
Adjusted for modern raiding, but with the fundamental experience of fighting the Brood Mother still in effect, including the horrors of her Deep Breaths!<br />
Onyxia will now drop level 80 item versions of some classic loot items from the level 60 encounter.<br />
Brood of Onyxia, a very rare 310%-speed mount modeled after Onyxia herself will be available for the luckiest of challengers.<br />
<br />
General<br />
Armor Penetration Rating: The amount of armor penetration gained per point of this rating has been reduced by 12%.<br />

PvP<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
Players level 11 and higher will now always see a daily Battleground quest, as the quest giver will only offer daily quests for a Battleground in which a player is eligible to participate according to level bracket (i.e. players levels 11-20 will always be offered a Warsong Gulch daily quest, while players levels 11-50 will be offered either an Arathi Basin or a Warsong Gulch daily quest, etc.).<br />

Maximum number of Battlegrounds Queues reduced to 2 in 3.2.2<br />
All of the User Interface changes in 3.2.2 to the Battleground queuing system are to help address matches starting with uneven numbers on each team. These changes may not fully address the situation, but in that case we have some other possible solutions we can implement further down the road. <br />
<br />
From the 3.2.2 PTR Patch Notes: <br />
Players may now only queue for no more than two Battlegrounds at a time.<br />
The dialog box for entering a Battleground match has been changed to reflect the following options: “Enter Battle,” “Leave Queue,” and “Minimize.”<br />
The time a player has to enter a battle when selected has been reduced to 40 seconds when not already in a Battleground and 20 seconds when in a Battleground.<br />
Players already in a Battleground can now choose “Enter Battle” for a new Battleground under any circumstance (i.e. while dead, in combat, falling, etc.).<br />
A new Battleground will not launch until the maximum number of players on each side are in the queue (i.e. 40 players per side for Alterac Valley).<br />
<br />
Implementing Tenacity in Battlegrounds<br />
That's highly unlikely. We'd rather exhaust every measure possible -- which we have not as of yet -- to get the matches even rather than just concede that it can't be done and implement something like Tenacity as a result. Tenacity can be controversial and isn't designed for instanced PvP. Besides, I doubt most players would like to see Battlegrounds arbitrarily balanced by a buff rather than by numbers of players on each team. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19820633274-please-explain-why-only-2-bg-queues-in-322.html))<br />

Next Classes Q&amp;A Series<br />
The timing of BlizzCon next to the priest Q&amp;A made conducting a short follow-up Q&amp;A difficult. With all of the recent announcements coupled with the 3.2.2 testing process, we're looking to start another round of class Q&amp;A's in the near future. We don't have a class order yet, but it shouldn't be the same as the last one. We're in the process of discussing ways of improving the Class Q&amp;A Series, looking at what worked well the first time and what didn't. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/19820873197-where-are-our-followup-questions.html))<br />
<br />

Scourge Strike vs. Obliterate in 3.2.2<br />
Scourge Strike does appropriate damage given that it ignores all armor. The problem with Obliterate, we believe, was because so many talents and glyphs propped it up more than Scourge Strike. In a PvP scenario it's pretty unlikely your target will be sundered at all, in which case Scourge Strike will generally beat Obliterate anyway.<br />
<br />
We aren't likely to bring back the gigantic DK strikes of older patches. We had huge problems with DKs being overpowered back then. The DK is supposed to have to set up those attacks and use them essentially as finishers. Yet DKs are also doing a lot of damage with their diseases and runic power attacks in addition to the two-handed strikes. All of that ignores the fact that DKs have enormous survivability and crowd control.<br />
<br />
When you aren't facing a shaman or another pro dispeller, Unholy does fine damage with Scourge Strike. We've just seen a big rise in shaman lately in Arenas. That's ultimately a good thing, but I understand that it can feel a little like the whole Plague Strike removing hots deal in reverse. The answer is not to make Scourge Strike hit so hard that the diseases don't matter or that nothing really matters but getting really big Scourge Strike crits. <br />
<br />
[...] All of the 3.2.2 changes were just to get Unholy DKs to put down the Obliterate button, which as I've said several times now, was a pretty big deal on these forums for a few weeks. (Which is not to say you should make a really big deal of anything you want to change.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820872699-yay--more-dk-nerfs.html))<br />

2 pieces T9 Bonus only critting for 50%<br />
Some of your points have been pretty convincing and have been taken into consideration. While this is more of a design change vs. a bug, I have found that it should in fact be a 100% critical damage multiplier. This will be corrected for 3.2.2, but may not be in a build until next week.

Levelling in Battlegrounds will become even harder though, since rarely in most lower brackets the exact number of players can be found. Moreover, in that case it doesn't even mean immediatly imbalance, since I saw more than once 25 lvl 69-70 players winning AV against 40 lvl 62-63 players.<br />

I would apply the rule only to the final level bracket.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a lot like using a Phillips head for all your screwdriver needs.<br />
<br />
I mean you can reach some level of workability, but you'll never have complete compatibility, things will always be imbalanced.<br />
<br />
So you apply a buff that alters various skills for each element, meaning you can keep the skills, but you'll now get to balance each for each style of play without sacrificing anything.<br />
<br />
I hope they eventually reach this conclusion, the nerfs/buffs continuum is tiresome.</div></div><hr />

If they haven't said it's hitting extra targets, then it's not. Read &quot;secondary targets&quot; as &quot;the secondary target&quot; but referring to multiple combat occasions.<br />

It was changed to allow you to use these abilities while stunned, which you can still do. These abilities didn't break the stun or incapacite effect anyways.<br />
<br />
I don't see too much value in being able to take less damage while you are CCed, or to push players back, you are not taking any direct damage anyways (as direct damage breaks these effects).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can see what I'm saying at 2:43 and again later during the 2nd burrow.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nubs</div><div class="date">2009-09-11, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I call BS on part of the stars kill<br />
<br />
@ 2:32, you can see AN's target, he gets pre-hotted an shielded and you see him start to get hit right as the camera shifts. Every time the spikes hit, it does &quot;17,672 to 19,828&quot; damage that can not be armor mitigated. If you start counting aloud with the spike pacing and even though the camera shifts, you can estimate that he gets hit 10-11 times. So he took, best case scenario, 17,672 x 10 damage or roughly 176k damage. Using youtube as a makeshift timer, he takes the 176k (best case scenario) damage over approximately 4 seconds (2:41 - 2:45). Now I didn't see PS on him, but I assume he had GS on him, even though it looked like it was paly wings (is there some type of animation change for Asia?). At first I thought, it's possible that he was a tank, seeing as how he had a shield and just popped SW for damage mitigation, but you see him running to the camera and he pops mana shield, therefore he is clearly a shaman.<br />
<br />
Ok, let's do a mitigation buff role call:<br />
PW:S - Limited to 1 due to debuff<br />
Earth Shield - Limited to 1 due to mechanics (? I'm not sure, I'm probably wrong about this one)<br />
GS - Who knows? To do this type of damage holding, he'd need at least 2 on him.<br />
<br />
Ok, so best case scenario, he's taking 176k/4 = 44k DPS, so it's safe to say he's dying every second. So I'll try to make some type of logical time chart for him to survive.<br />
<br />
K, let's assume the healers are damn good, so for ease of math, 5 healers doing 10k HPS, therefore 50k HPS on a single target. AN seems to spike 5 times every 2 seconds, so (best case) 17k*5/2, or 42.5k DPS. Then theoretically you could out heal the spike, but 5 healers doing 10k single target HPS is damn impressive, seeing as how you aren't going to stack palys due to P3. From the video there were 4 priests and 3 druid, most likely at least 1 holy priest (once again didn't see PS or penance) and the druids were split feral/moon/tree (for the raid buff trifecta).<br />
<br />
Time: 0 Second(s) ------- 1 Second(s) ------- 2 Second(s) ------- 3 Second(s) ------- 4 Second(s)<br />
AN D: Hit 1 ---- Hit 2 ---- Hit 3 ---- Hit 4 ---- Hit 5 ---- Hit 6 ----- Hit 7 ---- Hit 8 ---- Hit 9 ---- Hit 10<br />
T2D: 50% ----- 25% ---- 50% ----- 25% ---- 50% ---- 25% ----- 0%<br />
Evnt: ------------------- GS proc ----------- GS proc ---------- Dead<br />
<br />
<br />
Key: AN D - Anub damage timer : Heal - Healing CDs : T2D - What I realistically believe his Time to Death is, health % : Evnt - Event occured<br />
<br />
I think I was quite generous too with my estimations, so unless they had three holy priests, I don't see this being possible.<br />
<br />
Edit: I see someone just posted about this too, hopefully this helps<br />

<br />
You can see they do it several times throughout the spikes, I guess its a benefit to bringing so many pallies for the stuns :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just that one guild didn't abuse a 2nd game mechanic with soulstones..<br />
<br />
Hopefully it will be more challenging for the guilds after DW and BoP get changed for that fight.</div></div><hr />

They should change the in BG to 30-35 seconds because if it pops right as you die and you hit a 30 second rez you miss out.</div></div><hr />

Maximum number of Battlegrounds Queues reduced to 2 in 3.2.2<br />
A new Battleground will not launch until the maximum number of players on each side are in the queue (i.e. 40 players per side for Alterac Valley).<br />
<br />
:( I liked repeatedly getting one mark at a time because the teams were 15 vs. 40. Now the games would actually be fair :-\<br />

Oh... I thought this only referred to the disease bonus damage. :(<br />

It does still remove snares from allies as an instant pulse, but there is no lingering immunity. Earthen Power now also brings Earth Shock’s melee attack speed reduction up to -15%/-20% (with 1 or 2 points in it, respectively).<br />
* Stoneclaw Totem's pulses will no longer break stealth on nearby hostile units.<br />
* Thunderstorm and Shamanistic Rage can no longer be used while Frozen, Cycloned, Sapped, or Incapacitated.<br />

PVP enh is dead before it got started... about 3 months ago we finally started to see good changes come our way all of a sudden where we actually sometimes stood a chance against rogues and others now we regress again... nice job blizz i guess its time to go resto again like the previous 6 seasons</div></div><hr />

Secondary target(S)<br />
Heart Strike will hit more than 1 secondary target, a good buff indeed!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ummm no there is no buff<br />
<br />
the s means that your target can change meaning there can be multiple secondary targets.</div></div><hr />
