Many people wonder when will the beta of Cataclysm will start, it's time to (try to) answer that question! <br />
<br />
As far as I know, the Beta is supposed to start in April. At this point it's not very clear if there will be a Friends &amp; Family Alpha, if there is one it hasn't been widely advertised internally. <br />
<br />
This is probably why Blizzard decided to spoil the Cataclysm Prologue in 3.9 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/an-assault-on-two-fronts-patch-3-9/) a few weeks ago and waaaay before it's deployed on live servers. They're not huge fans of spoilers and the only reason to do it is to make sure people know what's going on when they eventually play on Beta servers. <br />
<br />
From a technical point of view, I guess it also explains why most of the assets for both Patch 3.3.5 and Patch 3.9 have been deployed with Patch 3.3. It's probably much easier to maintain a Beta and a Live build at the same time when you don't have to deploy tons of files just because you had to add something on live servers. <br />
<br />
Of course, this is a pretty risky news because Beta tests can be postponed if something funny happens but as far as I'm concerned, it should definitely happen in April. If the beta lasts as long as WotLK's you can expect a release of the expansion in September/October, most likely before the Blizzcon. <br />
<br />
And before someone smart posts in comments, I do realize it's not hard to predict that. We all know that Cataclysm will be released in 2010, we all know how much time a beta test takes and we all know the beta will start in April/May/June. But I'll just pretend it was an April's Fool joke if I'm wrong, you can do that in May. <br />
<br />
No matter what happens, you will NOT get any beta invitation before it's officially announced. Anything you receive is a huge scam to steal your account.<br />

Introducing: the Story Forum<br />
We are pleased to introduce the Warcraft Story Forum where players can discuss the storylines of the Warcraft universe, as told in-game and through the novels, manga, comics, and short stories that Blizzard publishes. Be sure to visit the new forum here- http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/board.html?forumId=26354482&amp;sid=1<br />
<br />
What is Creative Development?<br />
Creative Development (CDev) is a &quot;hub&quot; within Blizzard, facilitating the development of ancillary products and services that tie into Blizzard's game universes. While there are several different divisions of CDev, this Warcraft Story forum focuses on the efforts of the Publishing division.<br />
<br />
What does Creative Development's Publishing division have to do with Warcraft's stories and lore?<br />
The Publishing division within Creative Development is the driving force behind every published story you've seen outside of the game: short stories, novels, comics, and manga.<br />
<br />
Who comprises the Publishing division of Creative Development?<br />
Publishing is made of two groups:<br />
Story Development: this group focuses on story idea creation, story outlining, and story development for licensed fiction, as well as for internally-written stories<br />
Historians: this group is the repository for all Blizzard lore, providing counsel for the game development teams and the CDev Story Development group<br />
<br />
What is the Publishing division's usual process for developing a story?<br />
Idea Generation &amp; Outline Creation: Working with Chris Metzen and the designers on the respective game's development team, the Story Development team generates an idea and an outline for a story. The writer on the project is typically invited to our offices at this point in the project, so that they can be in on the ground floor of the story's creation.<br />
Story Development &amp; Lore Checking: Over the course of the project, the Story Development team talks constantly with the writer, as well as with Chris Metzen and the game developers, in order to help hone the story into a Blizzard-quality tale. At the same time, our Historian team combs through the iterations of the story in order ensure that the story adheres to the universe's established canon.<br />
<br />
<br />
What does the Publishing division hope to accomplish with this Warcraft Story forum?<br />
We'd like to give the community a chance to influence the development of our upcoming stories, so we're trying something new; this forum will serve as a direct line to our story developers. Please note that we're not looking for fully-formed stories - save those for the Global Writing Contest (which we operate and judge) - but rather we're looking for specific examples of what people like, don't like, and what they would like to see (story-wise) from us in the future. <br />

Taunts missing = interesting gameplay?<br />
I'm going to vote for not interesting gameplay.<br />
<br />
At the very least, you should be able to reduce your chance to miss a Taunt to zero if you reduce your chance to miss with a weapon to zero. It's also possible we'll just let them always hit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/24038825781-taunts-missing--interesting-gameplay.html))<br />

Starfall nerf?<br />
At some point I posted some numbers for Starfall since there hadn't been a PTR build in some time and druids were chomping at the bit to figure out just how much damage it was going to do. The numbers we went with for 3.3.3 were slightly lower than that if I recall correctly, but we haven't made any changes to Starfall since the patch went live. The live Starfall numbers are still much higher than they were in 3.3.<br />
<br />
We generally don't try to execute actual &quot;stealth nerfs.&quot; The community will nearly always figure it out anyway so we don'y gain much by trying to hide anything. Sometimes &quot;stealth nerfs&quot; are just things we didn't manage to document, but many times they are misunderstandings.<br />
<br />
(I'm talking about live anyway. On betas and PTRs numbers are going to change quite a bit -- that's the whole idea.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038765550-stealth-starfall-nerf-eh.html))<br />

Can't Thunderclap while silenced<br />
It is called &quot;Thunder&quot; and &quot;Clap.&quot; That implies some noise. :)<br />
<br />
Seriously though, silence isn't a dispel. Dispels are tied to magical effects. Silences are just tied to things that (more or less) logically require an audio component (in the game fiction -- I'm not talking about your sound card) to work. Most caster spells qualify but some other abilities do too. <br />
<br />
As soon as I read that I thought, &quot;Man, GC just opened up a can of worms&quot;. I understand where you are coming from but now we get to read 10 pages of &quot;Wait, I don't have to make noise to do X, why does it obey silence!?&quot; <br />
<br />
That response is certainly possible, but I figure part of what I can do out here (in exchange for all the feedback we get) is offer the occasional intent behind a game decision. Sometimes players can get us to question those decisions, but in cases like this it's going to take more than &quot;It doesn't seem to *me* like silence could stop a Thunder Clap.&quot; Trying to arbitrate how the physics of magic should work is a pretty futile exercise. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/24038825349-cant-thunderclap-while-silenced.html))</div></div><hr />

Cant find the source, but iirc it started late '09 or early '10. They just did it a lot better this time regarding leaked info and such.<br />
<br />
Its also been quite a while for people claiming beta/3.3.5/3.9 to happen before the summer. I mean.. in the summer people are outside, on vacation... not ideal for beta testing or any form of events. Postponing it till after summer can miss a pre-xmas release which they likely try to avoid. So only logical option is april/may to start it off.</div></div><hr />

12th of january 2010 was the start of F&amp;F alpha. So after 3-months of F&amp;F by now, would it be unthinkable for it to be ready to head into beta?<br />
<br />
As for the original quote:<br />
<br />

&quot;We reached out to our sources on the topic, (..) , they were able to confirm the alpha phase's tentative starting date. Barring any unexpected hurdles appearing in the next few days, the Friends and Family Alpha Phase will begin on the 12th of January.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I (accidently) got informations some time ago that hinted towards a F&amp;F alpha. But could have been an internal alpha too...anyway ICQ mistells ftw. :P (Or he just wanted to tease me..you never know what blizz employees are up to &gt;:()</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and for the alpha stage, full of pitfalls and not-yet-implemented things, a team of professional testers (with access to GM commands to skip past known bugs) may be more productive than family and friends anyway.</div></div><hr />

If the beta lasts as long as WotLK's you can expect a release of the expansion in September/October, most likely before the Blizzcon. <br />
<br />
And before someone smart posts in comments, I do realize it's not hard to predict that. We all know that Cataclysm will be released in 2010, we all know how much time a beta test takes and we all know the beta will start in April/May/June. <br />
<br />
Didnt Mike Morhaime say at some point that the SC2 beta was supposed to start in the summer 09? Hard to trust them when it comes to beta/release dates :D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But I'll just pretend it was an April's Fool joke if I'm wrong, you can do that in May. <br />

Can't Thunderclap while silenced<br />
It is called &quot;Thunder&quot; and &quot;Clap.&quot; That implies some noise. :)<br />
(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/24038825349-cant-thunderclap-while-silenced.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
that's such a lame answer... everyone knows that some physical attacks need spell-hitcap / you can not do them while silenced because when devs created the abilities in the first place in vanilla they where created as spells and many things where different / not so exact.<br />
<br />
Thunderclap started doing nature dmg + devs thought it would be strange if someone could dodge/parry it therefore it is a spell &gt; reacts to silence... nowadays it does phys dmg and got changed to a ranged attack in the last patch because it felt strange to have an attack only doing 150% crit dmg that needs a hit-cap.<br />
<br />
On the &quot;you need to make noise to Thunderclap&quot;... ohh lol there you go someone is confusing cause and effect. When you do a Thunderclap you hit the ground with such force it trembles thus slowing the enemies movement-speed and doing some dmg. Its origin lies in the Thunder Clap of the wc3 Mountain King. Yes it makes noise when you slam the ground, yes the ability is called Thunderclap because makes noise that fearful enemies compare to Thunder, but no a silence does not prevent me from hitting the ground as hard as i can. check you logics mister GC. <br />
<br />
Silence silences your tongue not you or your surroundings. If it would silence your whole existence / put a anti noise bubble around you, i would love to see an goblin assassin that lets himself silence so he could kill everyone in stormwind with his bombs, but no one will ever notice, because you know what he was silenced, tadaa!</div></div><hr />

Sounds reasonable. But I go against everyone and say: autumn. (the worst season to release...but as you wrote..we will buy everything, anytime)<br />
Summer (i.e. august latest) still sounds too early. But I just let them surprise me.</div></div><hr />

Less copies, maybe, but they would also be able to settle their game into the &quot;gaming drought&quot; period of the summer, which is a time when no new releases come out. It would shift all the player attention on the big name titles that come out, like Starcraft II.<br />
<br />
And to be fair, Starcraft II is a pretty big game in its own right. I would assume that it releases in May right before the &quot;drought&quot; and create a lot of revenue simply because it gives people something to do during the summer, but just the brand and the developer should give a lot of sales.<br />
<br />
Besides, if the beta's being done right now, there's very little doubt that the release is sometime before the end of summer. I really doubt they'd put out the beta build and not have the game on sale for a few months afterward. It's not Blizzard's style to postpone a game for months just for Christmas sales.<br />

You do make good points but it is Activision who is the publisher and they are 50% of the company now :(.</div></div><hr />

With the F&amp;F Alpha news earlier this year not working out I couldn't help but think that Blizz was using that to find out where their leaks are.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falcio</div><div class="date">2010-03-30, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You do make good points but it is Activision who is the publisher and they are 50% of the company now :(.<br />
<br />
Activision's control over Blizzard is a widely-made misconception. Blizzard actually has a lot of power still. They're a stand-alone division and are able to put out games whenever they feel like it. Even before in Vivendi, Blizzard was pretty much independent. Activision is very wise to keep their hands off Blizzard and just let them produce the games the way they want. WoW's revenue alone probably makes up for any sort of loss Activision would have by not getting a release from them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If cataclysm is not released before Blizzcon yet the beta is live for cata for months before Blizzcon, then Blizzard will have nothing to say about Cata on Blizzcon (other than perhaps talk about 4.1-4.2)<br />
I'm sure they could have a lot to talk about concerning Cataclysm, going beyond the future of the game and maybe talk about some new developments...how the game's going and whatnot. Dungeon Finder, for example, was a footnote in Blizzcon last year and has become quite a big staple in our everyday WoW lives.<br />
In fact, the majority of the conference could just be how much people are enjoying the content provided and Blizzard's thoughts on how all of it spanned out. I suspect the Q&amp;A to be the major point of the conference this year if Cataclysm comes out before the convention.<br />
<br />
Also, you forget that Blizzcon is more than simply WoW. Diablo III has yet to come out, and even if Starcraft II comes out, there's two other versions on the way. And who knows what else they might have in store for this year.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanarot</div><div class="date">2010-03-30, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wouldnt be surprised if blizzcon is about the future on cata, not the release or such. <br />
They're giving a huge load of stuff again with cata. Basicly every tree gets revamped due to mastery, new stats are introduced and others taken away.<br />
<br />
<br />
So imagine it towards adressing class problems/concerns (mainly hunter as the entire class is changed), the new bg system (and following that likely lower importance on arena itself) and what to expect in 4.1/4.2 and how that will affect stat conversions.<br />
Also remember they stated that stat converions will change on expansions (mobs/bosses harder to hit and avoid on later stages) which will need to be explained.</div></div><hr />

Once again, Blizzard probably gives more than enough money through WoW subs to be &quot;relegated&quot; by Activision over when games should be released.<br />
<br />
I think in the industry, there's a certain amount of money per quarter that needs to be met for the main company to still support the other company. In Blizzard's case, however, it might be that the MPQ idea doesn't work in this particular company relationship, or the agreement made between the two means Blizzard's WoW subs are enough money to meet any MPQ needed.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Granted, I am out of the loop on how Activision works and how the game industry works as a whole, so I may be wrong on the &quot;money per quarter&quot; deal, but logically, I would assume it's how it works. If a company isn't giving out releases and making money for the company in a certain amount of time, then the main company has the right to close the company.<br />
<br />
And again, I am pretty sure the agreement between Activision and Blizzard is that Blizzard is a separate entity and is thus unpressured by Activision in this situation. And if they end up in a pressured situation, then Blizzard might very well have all the rights to their main franchises still and are able to leave.<br />
<br />
Like I said before, Activision would be preeeeeeetty stupid to try and put a leash on someone that's giving them as much money as they are. Like you said, money talks and Blizzard is the one with the money maker.</div></div><hr />

I thought maybe it would be out around May-July around the summer as I think it links with what will happen with azeroth i.e with the vocano eruptin and all the lava etc..<br />

Hopefully it will reduce the number of compromised accounts. I know the general feeling is that if someone is dumb enough to believe a scam they deserve to get hacked, yet the less it happens the more time Blizz can devote to other matters. I've been playing since 2007 and in that time I've blown off two other MMOs and decided to stick with WoW, despite all the negativity found in the community. I cannot wait for the day when those original zones get transformed and those dull gopher type quests get erased.<br />
<br />
Ok so the gopher type delivery boy quests probably won't disappear, but I'll still dislike them. Now go all the way across the zone and fetch me 20 animal hides, mmm k?</div></div><hr />

Beta's take alot of time, money and concentration to run, and they are currently doing one. SC2's beta is comming along pretty well (I think?) And it's release date is approching. I know, there are probably different teams on both SC2 and Cata, but Blizz isn't a HUGE company, so my guess is the 2 teams have some shared members. I am just glad that someone high up in the WoW community believes the same time line I do. :) My guess, we'll see the Cata beta be as long, if not shorter than the WotLK. There isn't alot of new tech going into it, no new classes (even though they are redoing all the classes, and racials), and they aren't creating a new contient this time. Just reskinning the old ones. From what I've seen around the net from their press conferences and such, they have all the plans down and they really have there crap together on this one. :) I am pretty sure that this one will be out by Blizz Con, and will be there big celebrational thing, with alot of new stuff on Diablo 3, and the SC2 second chapter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you kidding?<br />
They are changing nearly, if not, 100% of Azeroth. There will be new quests, new zones, new instances, battlegrounds, races. A whole new talent system for all classes and stats! This is by far the biggest development Blizzard have made, in the history of WoW.<br />
...And blizzard got more than enough money, to run a beta version for more than 5 month.</div></div><hr />

Threat. My DK has 272 (8.30%) hit rating and 30 expertise /w 44k unbuffed and 35k armor unbuffed. My avoidance is 29% dodge and 21% parry. I tank hard modes. I never miss my taunt. And I don't take anymore damage than my warrior counter-part. He also is hit capped at 8% and expertise capped. It's only these tanks that do nothing but stack armor and stamina that complain about taunts missing. They don't realize that threat is as important as surviving. There are few fights out there that are actually &quot;fun&quot; to tank. If my taunt never missed on Saurfang I would probably fall asleep. Cause that is a terribly uninteresting fight to tank. If my taunt misses I actually get excited for a few seconds before going back to my 1.2.3.4,yawn and 5 rotation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard need to either:<br />
<br />
1. Employ more staff; or<br />
2. Work harder, they fucking earn enough money!<br />
<br />
I feel that the cycle of wotlk was absolute turd.<br />
<br />
-Release; Do raids; Get all you need within a month; Farm aimlessly for 4 months<br />
<br />
-Ulduar released; Find it cool for a couple months; Get bored and farm aimlessly for 2 months; Never go Naxx/OS/EoE again<br />
<br />
-ToC released; Shitty gating system; Get bored after 1 full clear; Never run Ulduar again cos ToC is so damn easy and short; Farm for 4 months.<br />
<br />
-ICC released; More shitty gated content to prolong gameplay; Farm for 10 MONTHS....<br />
<br />
So yeah, its just 4 months of Naxx, 4 months of Ulduar, 4 months of ToC, 10 months of ICC, then Cata.... What a shit expansion from a development point of view. The only good thing about the expansion was Ulduar, imo one of the best ever raids, was as close to perfect as can be in every sense. ICC was a failboat - theres no atmosphere, it doesnt feel like a CITADEL, its just corridor - boss - corridor - boss.<br />

<br />
- Lore and Storyline are not that good, its as poorly written as a bad Saturday Morning cartoon/anime<br />
<br />
- There really is no such thing as story or plot advancement, try as you might with gating and such but its still pointless. <br />
<br />
- Playerbase does not care about storyline or spoilers, there is no such thing as &quot;watching it as it happens&quot;. There are like 3 maybe 4 story events per expansion and they are usually predictable with poor dialogue. Everyone knew even before 3.3 was announced that Arthas would die and Bolvar would be the new LK. <br />
<br />
- There was one storyline that a few people cared about, that was the Lich King. Not because it was an appealing or well written piece of lore, it was far from that, but because they just wanted to see how it ended because they were patient enough to trudge through WC3. <br />
<br />
So it is just as easy to tell us straight up what is going on at the start instead of trying to pretend this is a well written role playing game. 98% of players who play this game only do it for the loot anyway. And really, what interesting plot could you come up with for Catacylsm? Oh no a dragon caused so much damage to the world! Let me guess, there will be quests to help heal the damage and heal the land and then at the end of the expansion we will fight Deathwing! Predictable. Not lame, but predictable.</div></div><hr />

I logged on this morning to check the news and the headline reads &quot;Cataclysm Testing in April, Blue posts&quot;. I got excited and scrolled down expecting to see, well, blue posts about the Cataclysm beta. I read through the post and it seemed to amount to nothing more than speculation the likes of which has been seen in threads on every WoW related message board since Cataclysm was released. Sure, the timeline makes sense, but people have been projecting something exactly like this for months now.<br />
<br />
Maybe I've missed something, and far be it for me to question whatever sources Boub has, but I felt that the title was a bit misleading. I'm not trolling or anything, just voicing my opinion here. I love this site and hope I don't incur the wrath of the banhammer for this post. :) That said, I certainly do hope they open the beta up soon. I'm laying dead for Cataclysm. :)</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, silence isn't a dispel. Dispels are tied to magical effects. Silences are just tied to things that (more or less) logically require an audio component (in the game fiction -- I'm not talking about your sound card) to work. Most caster spells qualify but some other abilities do too.<br />
<br />
Is he on fucking crack? A silence is and has always been(not just in wow) something that hinders the ability to cast spells(as most spells in fantasy history require something to be said) TC is a spell in wow, therefore able to be obstructed by silence.<br />

Actually ... I'm thinking by the end of the expansion, most of Azeroth's major factions will realize the planet is on the way to becoming another Outlands. I mean, seriously ... untold major wars, several major dimensional disturbances, two sunderings ... there's no way the planet can hold together any longer. <br />
<br />
Perhaps this will lead to the next expansion being based around finding a new home for Azeroth's people somehow.</div></div><hr />

I highly doubt it will even if Blizzard is claiming so. It all depends when they will launch Starcraft. There will be 2-3 months between these titles. Thats for certain cause that way they will be able to use the same support sale groups for both games. So... one of these two games is not coming in 2010 - even if Blizzard is saying it will. My bet is that Starcraft 2 is coming in late September - oktober. The most likely scenario is then that Cataclysm is coming in late January - early Febuary. All this is ofc depending on how BOTH games will do in beta tests.</div></div><hr />

So it is just as easy to tell us straight up what is going on at the start instead of trying to pretend this is a well written role playing game. 98% of players who play this game only do it for the loot anyway. And really, what interesting plot could you come up with for Catacylsm? Oh no a dragon caused so much damage to the world! Let me guess, there will be quests to help heal the damage and heal the land and then at the end of the expansion we will fight Deathwing! Predictable. Not lame, but predictable. <br />

You want them to Beta Test a near complete refresh of the game in three months?<br />
<br />
Also 5K for Blizzcon? Are you mad? Let's look at costs:<br />
<br />
$300-600 for a plane ticket (depending on where you're coming from and how good a deal you get, maybe $8-900 if you're coming from Europe)<br />
$200-400 for hotel depending on where you stay and all (remember, it's only a 2 day event. We could say $3-600 if you want to travel fresh)<br />
$200 for tickets (I think. It's around there)<br />
$100-300 for food (depending on whether you stay an extra day, and what kind of food you eat)<br />
<br />
Assuming you're flying in from Europe, get expensive plane tickets, stay in a really nice hotel and spend an extra day (while eating in nice restaurants) you're still not even breaking 2K here. In the more likely event that you fly Southwest, stay in a halfway decent hotel for two nights, and keep your food budget under control you could do it for under a thousand, and still have some money for souvenirs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2010-03-30, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You do realise the UK has incredibly high prices on travel outisde of europe, a well as 17.5% tax on almost everything we purchase in the UK? When we pay to stay in a hotel, regardless of where it is, we have to pay that tax, as well as an &quot;extortionate&quot; amount in the first place.<br />
<br />
While we can get a flight to spain or such for as cheap as $20, going to a place of your choice (i.e. it's not likely these flights go to anywhere you want to go) will cost you several hundred pounds, and in some cases, over £1000 (around $2000 i think).<br />
<br />
A quick check on a well-known price comparison website gives me an ECONOMY flight-only return from Manchester to Los Angeles comes out at £509 GBP. This is direct, and between the dates of Blizzcon. That's around $1000 for the travel. To stay at the Hilton Hotel near to the convention center for the same dates is 555.66 GBP. So far, we're pushing over the £1000 mark already. You then need to consider the ticket/entry itself, which will likely be around £75. Food, drink, souvenirs, and you're over the £1200 mark. That's for 4 nights, buying everything seperately, so you need to add in things like taxi to and from the airport, although i'm sure that pales in comparison to everything else. I don't know geography very well, so i don't know if LA Airport is the closest to Irvine, or whether there's something else. A quick google maps shows it as closest.<br />
<br />
So, while i was off with the $5000 initial guess, you can still see it's not cheap at all if you're flying from the UK. The initial flight i found was over £1000 itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are you paying British taxes on a hotel in the US? Make your reservation and pay US rates + US taxes, don't buy the room in advance. I've never gotten a hotel room in Britain, but I've traveled around the Continent a fair amount and hotel reservations there worked just like here. Call them up, say &quot;I want a room on Tuesday night&quot;, and they reserve it. You pay for it Wednesday morning when you're checking out. A Hotel room will cost you $200 a night on the outside if you shop around a bit (around 100GBP), probably you can mange $100-150. I estimated $900 on a flight coming in from Europe so I wasn't to far off. Also, you're paying for four hotel nights on a two day event. I can totally understand wanting to hang out and see the sights, but that's not really a &quot;convention&quot; cost. You're also in the worst case scenario. Most people won't be coming from Britain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thunderclap started doing nature dmg + devs thought it would be strange if someone could dodge/parry it therefore it is a spell &gt; reacts to silence... nowadays it does phys dmg and got changed to a ranged attack in the last patch because it felt strange to have an attack only doing 150% crit dmg that needs a hit-cap.<br />
<br />
On the &quot;you need to make noise to Thunderclap&quot;... ohh lol there you go someone is confusing cause and effect. When you do a Thunderclap you hit the ground with such force it trembles thus slowing the enemies movement-speed and doing some dmg. Its origin lies in the Thunder Clap of the wc3 Mountain King. Yes it makes noise when you slam the ground, yes the ability is called Thunderclap because makes noise that fearful enemies compare to Thunder, but no a silence does not prevent me from hitting the ground as hard as i can. check you logics mister GC. <br />
<br />
Silence silences your tongue not you or your surroundings. If it would silence your whole existence / put a anti noise bubble around you, i would love to see an goblin assassin that lets himself silence so he could kill everyone in stormwind with his bombs, but no one will ever notice, because you know what he was silenced, tadaa!<br />
<br />
Whose to say it is not the sound produced by your stomping that causes the the slow, etc, in that case you could still stomp but no sound wave comes out to slow the enemy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tell yourself whatever you need to in order to feel better about life. SC2 will come out long before Cata because 1) Its beta started 2 months sooner and 2) It's already so well polished that the beta will probably only last the minimum time period (~3 months or so). Expect a June release for SC2, and a mid fall release (September maybe, to correspond to the &quot;back to school&quot; period).</div></div><hr />

Including D2 and SC2, I've been in 4 Blizzard betas (plus given away 2 extra keys for Wrath and one extra for SC2). At this point I'd rather have a spot in D3 beta than Cataclysm beta, as seeing the Wrath content ahead of time made it less fun when it came out.<br />

I highly doubt it will even if Blizzard is claiming so. It all depends when they will launch Starcraft. There will be 2-3 months between these titles. Thats for certain cause that way they will be able to use the same support sale groups for both games. So... one of these two games is not coming in 2010 - even if Blizzard is saying it will. My bet is that Starcraft 2 is coming in late September - oktober. The most likely scenario is then that Cataclysm is coming in late January - early Febuary. All this is ofc depending on how BOTH games will do in beta tests. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SC2 will be out by July, unless there are some catastrophic problems with Bnet 2.0 features that are yet to be added. The game itself is pretty well balanced, even though it's not (and will never be) perfect. They can work on it for all of April and May, go gold in June and release it the last week of June with another 2-3 weeks of bug squashing and balance tweaking, since they've already committed to a launch day patch.<br />
<br />
That leaves plenty of time for a fall release of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
A more useful way to look at it regardless would be: They have to get it out within 5-6 months, or WoW will turn into a ghost town as people get bored of running ICC for 9 months straight.</div></div><hr />

SC2 will come out long before Cata because 1) Its beta started 2 months sooner and 2) It's already so well polished that the beta will probably only last the minimum time period (~3 months or so). Expect a June release for SC2, and a mid fall release (September maybe, to correspond to the &quot;back to school&quot; period).<br />

Aggressive much? Personally, I could care less about SC2, never been much of an RTS fan. I was simply giving an opinion.</div></div><hr />

Burden of proof is the obligation of a party on one side of a dispute or issue to provide sufficient evidence in support of their position.<br />
<br />
he made a claim, therefore has to offer proof that he is right. if he doesn't, then its just speculation (not that i'm not into speculating about things, i just hate people that say things are truth without evidence.)</div></div><hr />

Being stubbornly cynical in the face of all evidence is not the trait of a wise person, it is the trait of some one who lacks any ability to make judgments at all. Every time Boub posts some spoiler or piece of news there is some retard or a group of retards who think they're going to show how smart they are by &quot;debunking&quot; it (even when they need to find the weakest rationalization to do so) and they are inevitably wrong.<br />
<br />
Whether it be the retail box for Wrath, or spoilers about upcoming patches, content, Cataclysm, etc, Boub gets it consistently right, because he has good sources and because he doesn't generally post just any rumor that exists. Believe him or don't believe him, it's your right, but don't post about how you doubt it or blah blah blah and expect anything other than flaming/trolling directed in your direction. No one cares if you believe it, because unlike Boub, you really **are** an anonymous pissant on the internet. He has a track record and you just have a keyboard and an internet connection.<br />

Yeah...

<br />
Personally, I'm surprised that there hasn't been any news of the the F&amp;F alpha starting yet... and frankly with how closely every move Blizz makes is watched I doubt that the alpha starting up would slip past the fans completely...<br />

There's no blind following. Boub is an established expert with an impeccable record of being both insightful and accurate. In other words, he does not speculate, he simply reports things that are not widely known. Like many people who report facts, he does not always disclose his sources, but he does seem to understand which are credible and which are not.<br />
<br />
There is no real cost or downside to believing what he has to say in this case, so what is it that you are trying to protect yourself or others from? Are you just trolling?</div></div><hr />

LOL. From your tone, it's as if Boub had tried to tell us the meaning of life. He's a credible source for the dispersal of information that is - albeit interesting to many of us here - largely inconsequential to anything of significance in meat-space. To churn out high-sounding phrases like &quot;blindly follow somebody without question&quot; is to wax a tad melodramatic. Why so serious?</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind that two of the first items data mined, that lead us to believe Worgen and Goblins would be the two new races introduced in Cataclysm, were the Hallow's End masks of each race. It seems likely that if they went to the trouble of creating Halloween masks of the two races, so early on in development, that they planned to have Cataclysm launch before Halloween of 2010.<br />

I definitely think that we're looking at a Aug/Sep/Oct release. And, hopefully that definitely does mean beta testing real soon! ^_^</div></div><hr />

Before thinking about &quot;oh man 3 months of beta for game revamp are not enough!&quot; (they are, trust me), think about what the hell are we going to do until September, if a Sept relase is true?? Lich King is getting old and easy (30% is coming), Arena season is ending as well. Ruby Sanctum and various events can't keep the game going for another 6 months. I say 3.3.5 Relase end of April while the beta is going strong, 3.9 in May, and then 4.0 in June. At the very least, end of July relase. No further.<br />
<br />
In the end<br />
<br />
Mid/End April - 3.3.5<br />
April, May, June, Mid July - Cataclysm Beta<br />
End May - 3.3.9<br />
June- 4.0<br />
Mid July - Cataclysm Relase</div></div><hr />
