In the following post you will find the transcript of all the sound files added to the game with this patch, some of them will reveal a few parts of the storyline and you shouldn't click it if you do not want to see spoilers. <br />

Companion Pets Models<br />
Perky Pug (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/70600/perky-pug/) is the pet reward for running random dungeons through the new Dungeon System. <br />

<br />
Boss Models<br />
One more boss model in this build. This is an updated model for Lord Marrowgar. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Mount Models<br />
We can assume that they are the models of the mounts introduced with this build ... <br />
<br />
Invincible (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/72286/) - Summons and dismisses the flying undead horse Invincible. This mount changes depending on your Riding skill and location. <br />
Big Love Rocket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/71342/) - Summons and dismisses a rideable Big Love Rocket. This mount changes depending on your Riding skill and location.<br />
<br />
The Love Rocket will most likely be a rare drop from the Valentine's Day event and Invincible was Arthas' Mount before and after he became a Death Knight. The grave of his horse was in Balnir Farmstead in Tirisfal Glades. Last year during the Zombie Invasion world event, the grave was dug up randomly. (Thanks to War from Haomarush-US for the tip, you can also check the article on WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Invincible))<br />

<br />
we will see people with full best pvp set/weapon the first week... i dont want that :&lt;<br />

hopefully they will add a arenapoint cap each week. if not, its ridicilous easy to get gear and no reason getting higher rating than 2,2k</div></div><hr />

Might bring more people to bgs as well as keeping it objective orientated rather than mid-field zerg:)<br />

But than again I'm not especially &quot;hardcore&quot; and welcome such a change with open arms, even though I expect a lot of QQ regarding this from the slightly more serious parts of Azaroth^.^</div></div><hr />

Lay on Hands: This ability now places Forbearance on the target and cannot be used on a target with Forbearance. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While it doesn't help Protection tanking, I'd mostly given up on that being used for us any more. Now we have four abilities that can't be cross-used. While Hand of Protection and Divine Shield certainly make sense (chaining bubbles would be loltastic) I half wish they'd remove Divine Protection from the list. Doesn't change from the &quot;Can't use on yourself&quot; much though, as far as Prot goes. For ret or holy, now it's DS to get out of OH SHI- moment number one, and hope the second doesn't kill you so you can full heal (after 2 minutes).<br />
<br />
EDIT:: Didn't notice the lack of Sacred Shield in the FoL HoT, at least as far as the language for the new IoL talent goes. If it really is baseline and not dependent on SS, that could be a nice little buff for spot raid healing.</div></div><hr />

Shield wall lock for 2min because of LoH (and vice versa) ?<br />
<br />
Nice patch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Overweight</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm certainly perplexed by the arena points change, as long as they put a cap on it (maybe 400 or so points, basically let you double your weekly points if you're low rated) i think it's a decent idea. <br />
<br />
As far as the paladin changes, Love the change to Sacred Shield, keeping it useful for prot/ret, and making it stronger for holy through the FoL HoT change. Just re-read that... nice buff for holy, and takes some power out of Prot/Ret. im actually pretty ok with this.<br />
<br />
Lay on Hands causing forbearance on the other hand.... well I'm a bit skeptical. I think if they remove shieldwall from forbearance it's a fine change. (meaning BoP, DS, LoH cause it and are mutually exclusive. Wings can still cause the 20 second lockout, as it doesn't really affect raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as the paladin changes, Love the change to Sacred Shield, keeping it useful for prot/ret, and making it stronger for holy through the FoL HoT change. <br />
<br />
Lay on Hands causing forbearance on the other hand.... well I'm a bit skeptical. I think if they remove shieldwall from forbearance it's a fine change. (meaning BoP, DS, LoH cause it and are mutually exclusive. Wings can still cause the 20 second lockout, as it doesn't really affect raiding. <br />
I agree, they need to remove forbearance from shield wall under the prot tree. I use LoH way too much on the prot pally's in raid that I'm worried that it would counteract when they really need shield wall.</div></div><hr />

You are earning Arena POINTS from BGs, not Arena Rating<br />
<br />
You can have 1,000,000 Arena Points but if you don't have the Rating they are as useful as cocoa seeds are as legal tender.<br />
<br />
Good idea IMO, will help those good players get their earned armor sooner instead of waiting a couple of weeks for those points.<br />

<br />
Forbearance can solve a lot the OP QQ about Ret pallies.<br />
<br />
If LoH caused Forbearance when used on self and can not be used when you have Forbearance then it becomes a one or the other situation. Use DP become invulnerable, do half damage, break aggro and heal or use LoH. The Forbearance cool downs forces a Ret pally to pick one or the other and the Proc/Holy tree (deep down) can remove or reduce the Forbearance cool downs period.<br />
<br />
There by better balance for PvE vs PvP.</div></div><hr />

Shield wall lock for 2min because of LoH (and vice versa) ?<br />
<br />
Nice patch.<br />
<br />
They could easily bake it into some deep Prot talent that drops the Forbearance time for those tanking CDs. It's still not the best solution for LoH, but definitely better than &quot;can't use on yourself&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very much so. Much like the Avenging Wrath + Bubble quick fix.<br />
<br />
Most likely this is just some temporary solution they want to throw at us until they figure something simpler out.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for 25 points per win, that will definitely give people alot of motivation in BGs. Last time i played not very many people really gave a shit whether they win or not. <br />

You actually can only have 10,000 Arena Points (cap). But agreed on the thing about getting good players to do BGs. And perhaps people who do BGs a lot and avoid Arenas will have a reason to try and earn a rating. All in all I think it will cause more pvp play and more crossover between Arena players and BG players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since they added the &quot;report afk&quot; option I haven't had much trouble with afk players. As long as you flag them they generally get removed and don't get any of the honor. So it is basically the same. <br />
<br />
Anyway, what's the problem with getting honor from arena? Personally I like being able to &quot;trade currencies&quot; so to speak. Makes game play and grinding more time-efficient and therefore more fun and less life-wasting.</div></div><hr />

Arena points from bg's? yeeey! now we only need to be able to get rating aswell somehow without doing arena!<br />
God i hate arena so much, but now I have a choice atleast if I want to obtain the gear.<br />

someone LoH the tank, the tank can no longer use shield wall for 2min. when warriors can use shield block, shield wall, last stand and enrage regen at the same time, yeah, it's completely stupid that someone ELSE in the raid can render a tank's cd useless for 2min.</div></div><hr />

my main is a pally tank, and yeah the forbearance bullshit is stupid and clunky<br />
but its ALOT better then not being able to use it on yourself at all<br />
<br />
<br />
Not so much. Since our &quot;Shield Wall&quot; is a 2 minute cooldown (1.5m with 4pcT9) and so is Forbearance, you should (theoretically) always have Forbearance up, meaning that you use Shield Wall whenever possible unless you're saving it for a 2.5 minute timed boss move (in which case you don't want to LoH, since that'll cause forbearance and thus prevent you from using shield wall on the special boss move).<br />
<br />
So for tankadins, especially maintankadins, it's pretty much the same. *shrug* I'm not getting my hopes up on it being in Cata at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
also the change to flash of light to deep holy?? omfg<br />
if im reading it right then flash puts up a hot w/o needing SS on the target<br />
OMFG plz let that be true <br />
also does the cross out mean they are reverting the SS change back to 6 seconds?<br />
<br />
<br />
The SS change has gone back to 6 seconds. The FoL HoT not needing the target to be SS'd means that spot-healing the raid is easier. Assuming the druids, holy priests, and chain healing shaman don't beat you to it. And that you don't have to eyeball the tank and no one else. Not exactly prime parameters for a healadin.<br />
<br />
Though the SS revert is nice for ret and prot.<br />
<br />
EDIT:: Oh, and if you're saving Forbearance (LoH or DP) for an &quot;OH SHI-&quot; moment as a tank (and not hitting DP every 2/1.5 minutes), then you better tell all your healadins to never LoH you. Ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are degrading paladin utility by basing your decisions on some downie arena/BG retard spec. Good job keep it up. <br />
lol. I am sure Blizzard is reading your post here on the non-official forums.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I agree with this nerf and it's purpose, but not with the way it's being done. If they made DP not cause forbearance, then it would be good. I mean, it's just a damage reduction skill like all other tanks have. Warriors with shield wall, druids with barkskin, DKs with unbreakable armor and anti-magic bubble, etc.<br />
<br />
But yeah, it is kinda annoying when you're a non-healing class and ya get the pali down then he bubbles and heals, then get him down again and he LoHs....It's like having to kill him 3 times.<br />
<br />
Or another way they could fix this for prot palies and pali healers is to have LoH give Forebearance to whoever casts it, not the target it's used on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough.<br />
Then yes, this concept sucks, no class should be locked out from defensive cool-downs due to friendly players (Would be the same as rogue's not being able to vanish while having a hot on em or something, but they could just make it count for LoH used by the prot paladin itself i guess.<br />
Another way to approach the subject is to just remove LoH from being usable in arena's, but that would cause the same, if not more drama most likely.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why anyone would whine about Arena points in BGs. You're still gonna need ratings to buy the latest gear, and you can only buy last seasons armor without ratings, which has been in the game for a long time (buy it with Honor or badges).</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least someone noticed the most important part of this entire build.<br />
<br />
Arthas' horse! &lt;3<br />
<br />
Seems kinda awkward to be a flying mount to be honest though, I think it'd be fine and still very sought after even as just a regular mount.<br />
<br />
And for everyone crying about the arena points, you still need rating to buy the gear so it's not like everyone is going to be running around with Relentless weapons by the end of the first week, or even 3 months later, because people who are bad at PvP are still going to be bad at PvP and the people doing arenas are still going to be the ones dominating arenas. This just makes it easier to get INTO the arena by being able to buy, in this case, Furious gear without having to sit around and get farmed 10 times a week while you try and build up points, or sit around in VoA hoping for good RNG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, amagad Invincible! That's quite a legendary mount. I'm kind of hoping it's a 1%ish drop in 25hc so it'll remain very rare, as it should.</div></div><hr />

You are earning Arena POINTS from BGs, not Arena Rating<br />
<br />
You can have 1,000,000 Arena Points but if you don't have the Rating they are as useful as cocoa seeds are as legal tender.<br />
<br />
<br />
So true, which is why Blizzard puts the arena rating on gear every single season and you have no real reason to believe that Blizzard will even put arena rating on the gear this season. Face it, Blizzard is going to kill arena either in this expansion or the next because no one wants to mess with it. Over half of the population does battle grounds and only four percent do arenas. Its idiotic to think that arenas should be where all the pvp gear comes from given those two numbers, so when BLIZZARD REMOVES ARENA RATING FROM ITEMS don't be shocked.</div></div><hr />

Also, I'm laughing pretty hard. PvP tears are always the best. These guys are always the first to cry and rage over anything and everything, and it's genuinely the most amusing thing to watch. I don't care about arena points, I won't be getting arena gear with them because the attitude and poutting/feet-stamping that comes with most WoW PvPers turns me off of it to be frank, but you have to be a sad person to get so angry over WoW PvP.</div></div><hr />

I don't know anyone that doesn't know who Invincible was. At least not anyone that frequents this site. It's not as if he wrote a long essay about Rise of the Lich King either when the 3.3 PTR was announced.<br />

There was one system in WoW that awarded people for what they actually deserved, not RNG loot or easymode instances. This shit fucking ruins PvP and anyone who says any different is just a scrub waiting to gear themselves. <br />
<br />
<br />
Please tell me how when 95% of the top teams are RMP its a system that &quot;rewards people for what they actually deserve&quot;. That is a bullshit statement. Arenas don't reward people for what they actually deserve. They reward powerful class combinations for putting in next to no effort other than being over powered class combinations. Until Blizzard actually balances the classes (which it has failed to do for 5 years) then arenas are a pointless system (probably explains why 96% of the player base doesn't even touch them doesn't it?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't think you really understand what really pisses people off the most. The problem is two fold. 1) If you have forbearance on you (meaning you cast any of the abilities that put forbearance on you which is up to 4 now) then your holy paladin can't cast LoH on you. On the other side, if your holy paladin cast LoH on you then it locks out your cool downs for two minutes. Druids, Death Knights and Warriors all get to have LoH cast on them without locking out their cool downs at all. Its a direct nerf to paladin tanks that doesn't affect any other tank at all, and its mostly being done because of a PvP exploitation. So, most people are kind of pissed off because of that. Then there is the whole, its been in the game for 5 years and Blizzard just now decides to &quot;fix&quot; it thing. Pissing off everyone that plays one of your most popular classes is a good business strategy (assuming Blizzard now designs for Aion or the new Star Trek MMO).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Lay on Hands is not NOW nor was it EVER usable in arenas. This change has nothing to do with arenas. It has to do with the long standing tradition of just avoiding paladins in BGs unless you were with a group of people to take them down. That hasn't changed at all. If you don't think a paladin can survive for 2 minutes while taking a beating (especially holy and prot) in a BG then you obviously haven't ever fought one.</div></div><hr />

No point in making it usable more often. Because we don't use it at all in pve. Another BG inspired decision. <br />
<br />
<br />
Apparently you are a dps dk or a really bad tank dk. AoD aggro transfers to the tank which means it is quite easily one of the best opening moves for a tank so it will be nice that it will be up every boss even if its damage is halfed. Oh, and if you are a dps dk you should be using it every single heroism/bloodlust cast and if you aren't you are failing heavily. Trying to argue its only usable in heroics makes you look really stupid.</div></div><hr />

Paladins can't help playing better than you. Its just in their make up. They aren't overpowered they just don't suck.

<br />
tha woot? like.... now its only the rating that matters?<br />
<br />
we will see people with full best pvp set/weapon the first week... i dont want that :&lt;<br />
<br />
hopefully they will add a arenapoint cap each week. if not, its ridicilous easy to get gear and no reason getting higher rating than 2,2k<br />
<br />
<br />
if everyone has a 2200 rating team. then yeah everyone will have the best pvp gear in the first week. on a side note santa claus is giving free rides in his sleigh in fantasy land also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, LoH and other forbearence dependent abilities tied to eachother is a problem for slacking PvP winers as for the endgame PvE you really don't need to use them together due to the Seal of Wisdom activated on you and Sacred Shield with decreased cd there would be an unending mana and 12 sec Divine shield is well enough to heal yourself with the least mana consumption with the judgements, so its more of making a paladin a fake demi-god than a fake-god :D<br />

<br />
and we don't have any information on the horse.<br />
<br />
Invincible was Arthas' faithful mount until he rode him in a snow storm and tried to jump some mounds he did as a child w/ Invincible and didn't make it. It broke both the legs of Invincible and he had to put him down there... Thus the grave site (that was dug up... read main page). After Arthas took his sword and returned home he rose Invincible from his grave and made him his undead mount, which he (should) still ride today.<br />
<br />
My deal is why do we get to ride him? Its his mount, and from lore Invincible was very faithful to Arthas and i would think he wouldn't want to be taken by anyone. But meh to lore i guess.</div></div><hr />

Ok. I can take an opinion of someone that is harsh and such. But...you have no reasons why you hate everything. Why do you hate the LFG? Why is the patch in general going to FAIL? I think it's personally gonna be great because they are allowing both casual gamers and hardcore gamers what they want in a game. It shouldn't be all HARD MODE and likewise, not all EZ mode. We've all fought the same battles....we've all come to know Arthas in this game as well as previous games. What makes it wrong of Blizzard that they want people who have a life outside of WoW and don't have hours and hours and days at a time to grind to not see this through? Everyone should see Arthas go down or ... whatever happens. <br />
<br />
@the mount comment: please. They gave you a good lore description. How is it unoriginal? It modifies based on skill. It's model is unique and it was Arthas's mount. God. <br />

Really dont like where this is going. Really scary and amazing, the new people on this era is supposed to be smarter, if Blizzard controls the evolution the human race will die out soon, because they are apperently getting dumber and dumber for each generation.

Its sad we must suffer because of dumb people and casuals :(( gaming is so going down the drain, i think ill start to demand more money at work, because hey i want as much money as everyone else, because i work the same, and when they get the same in Wow then surely in reallife i can get everything, im a casual real lifer.<br />

I have a feeling Blizz don't actually want Army to be a dps function at all anymore. It's just a fucked up kind of aggro dump, and as far as I can tell that's what they...want(?) it to be...<br />
<br />
In other news... Perky Pug is freakin' awesome!!! I have 2 pugs of my own personally and adore them. This is so cool.<br />
<br />
Boss model looks absolute sex, as does it's Bone-axe.<br />
<br />
Arena point changes...meh. I haven't pvp'd in this game ever since BC ended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
•Infusion of Light now causes your Flash of Light to heal the target for an additional 50/100% over 12 sec.<br />
<br />
I kinda expected that actually...f**k! &gt;:(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peleth</div><div class="date">2009-11-04, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can already tell that this patch, like the others will fail horribly and will be too easy and fast to clear. The changes made are obsurd and don't reflect anything other than Blizzards personal standards without any consent.<br />
<br />
... Wut?<br />
If you are gonna whine about anything, aim for the PvP-changes. The PvE actually looks promising for once.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The new pet you get from the new LFG is ugly... It's a bad excuse for people to use the system which btw is badly implemented.<br />
Pugs (the dog, that is) rule.<br />

Seriously, if you don't like it - don't use it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The new boss model is unoriginal and poorly made. Once again shows how Blizzard can hire a bunch of goons who can draw simple little lines and make a horrid piece of art, texture it wrong, and make it important for something.<br />
<br />
It's not a &quot;horrid piece of art&quot;. It's a 3D model for a game. But I'm sure you could do better. ::)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The flying horse mount is once again, unoriginal and I can gladly say I will not be using it in my collection of mounts obtained. It also does not fit any lore which I can proceed in current time standards.<br />
Right. Invincible was born to the mare Brightmane on the Balnir Farmstead in Tirisfal Glades, in the winter of the year Stormwind fell. Prince Arthas, then nine years old, was present when he was born, and was given the horse by the Balnir family, who bred horses used by the royal family. The horse had a white coat, different from the usual Balnir stock, which normally had gray coats. Arthas had considered naming the horse &quot;Snowfall&quot; or &quot;Starlight&quot;, but in the informal tradition of Lordaeron knights and nobles naming their steeds after a quality (Uther's was &quot;Steadfast&quot;, King Terenas' &quot;Courageous&quot;), he named the colt &quot;Invincible&quot;.[1]<br />
<br />
In another winter ten years later, before Arthas was inducted into the Knights of the Silver Hand, Arthas' exertion in the numbing cold resulted in a crippling injury to his beloved Invincible. Too far from help and unable to heal the stricken horse, Arthas was forced to kill him in order to relieve his pain. He was buried on the grounds of the Balnir Farmstead at Arthas' request. Invincible's death was one of the events that inspired Arthas to become a paladin.[2]<br />
<br />
After the fall of Lordaeron years later, Arthas - now a death knight - ran directly from Lordaeron after murdering his father, to the Balnir Farmstead where Invicible was buried. With the power of Frostmourne, Arthas resurrected the horse as his undead steed.<br />
<br />
Is it really that hard to believe Arthas put wings on the damn thing afterwards? This is the Lich King. The man who have hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of undead at his command. I seriously doubt a pair of wings on a horse is beyond his ability.<br />
<br />
So you are ABSOLUTELY RIGHT! It makes no sense at all. *cough* ::)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I could care less about Shaman T10, it will most likely be as ugly as the first 9 tiers. Look forward to something unappealing.<br />
My Paladin laughs at anyone calling Shammy Tiers ugly. Gogo Pally Rangers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The rest of this build is just utter chaos and a waste of my time downloading... I'll wait for a build slightly better (if possible...yuck) before I try out the crappy PTR again.<br />
<br />
Wow... Just... Wow... I feel saddened that we can't have your gracious presence amongst us here on the PTR. Blizzard will surely put their entire team to work to please you with something better, oh great one.<br />
<br />
All in all: You fail at trolling.<br />

About the arena points, I'm thinking it's some sort of placeholder. You can easily win 50 bg's per day, so this change is really nice, I'd finally enjoy my hybrid class by getting gear for 2 specs.</div></div><hr />

Good News Everyone!<br />

It's like they murdered Prof. Farnsworth and Arthas resurrected him with a higher pitch voice...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eversor</div><div class="date">2009-11-04, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yay, a yappy dog as a reward for pugging. Honestly, just what springs in mind when I think of pugs.<br />
<br />
Arena points for battlegrounds? Sweet. Now just implement the rated system and I won't need to step into that horrible pvp minigame ever again.<br />
<br />
And, as it was shown before, when in doubt, throw Forbearance on it! Meh, don't really have anything against it.</div></div><hr />
