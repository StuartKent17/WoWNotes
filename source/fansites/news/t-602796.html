<br />
The [item=20475] ([spell=43676]) is also available now, letting you use 5 charges to create [item=33803]. This let you create decent crafted arrows and of course, use a single slot to stock 5 arrows in your backpack. <br />
There is also an Adamantite Shell Machine to create bullets but I couldn't get the stats on the PTR, it seems it's not activated yet. (But it's also harder to get items, you know what I mean)<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
All primary profession trainers outside of capitals (Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Enchanting, Engineering, Leatherworking, Tailoring) have been changed to train up to Artisan level (skill level 300) in their respective professions.<br />
The capital cities now possess Artisan level trainers for the primary professions they support, and are surrounded by their newly-dubbed Apprentices where applicable. Please visit your local Master trainer when you wish to train.<br />
<br />
Alchemy<br />

<br />
Blacksmithing<br />

Reduced the maximum skill obtainable from recipes between 200 and 300. This does not include Outland recipes.<br />

Plans for a new arrow making device can be found from Sunfury Archers.<br />
The plans for adamantite shells now create an Adamantite Shell Machine. The machine creates 200 high quality bullets at a time, with 5 charges per item.<br />
<br />

<br />

The ogres in the barrier hills are rumored to have a pattern for a 24 slot bag to hold leatherworking supplies.<br />
<br />
<br />

Items<br />
Atiesh: This item can no longer open portals in battlegrounds.<br />
Essence of Death now drops from level 57-60 non-elite undead in the Eastern Plaguelands.<br />

<br />
Tempest Keep<br />
The use of Ice Block, Divine Shield, Cloak of Shadows, and other similar spells and abilities will no longer prematurely detonate High Astromancer Solarian’s Wrath of the Astromancer spell.<br />
<br />
Mechanar<br />
(1) Nethermancer Sepethrea's Frost Attack now reduces movement speed by 25% rather than 50%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
Quest givers who have available daily quests will have a blue exclamation point instead of a yellow one.<br />
The range of the Battery Recharging Blaster used in the quest, “Recharging the Batteries” has been increased.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Interface<br />
(1) Sorting of auction house searches has been simplified so you can only sort by one column, and automatic sub-sorts have been created for those columns to be as useful as possible. In addition, sorting is now done on the server so as you page thru results, items will appear to be sorted across the entire results instead of just the page you’re looking at.<br />
(1) If you get a message &quot;Interface action failed because of an AddOn&quot;, this means that an AddOn interfered with the Blizzard UI in some way. To diagnose this, enter the following into chat &quot;/console taintLog 1&quot; and restart the game and try to reproduce it. If you reproduce it, you can quit the game and search through the file Logs\taint.log for the word &quot;blocked&quot; and mail the log to the author of the AddOn listed there. Once you have done this you can turn off logging by entering the following into chat &quot;/console taintLog 0”<br />
All players now have a tracking bubble on their minimap. From that menu you can select a specific type of vendor or npc to look for or you can select a specific tracking type if your character has tracking. Yes this means that hunters can take all of those tracking buttons off of their action bars.<br />
There are now options for displaying health and mana values on your health/mana bars for you/your party and to display that information either as percentages or as numbers.<br />
When you are possessing a target (Priest Mind Control, Eyes of the Beast, using a Steam Tonk, etc), you now get their action bar as your primary action bar rather than having a mini action bar above your normal action bar.<br />
When an item drops that you cannot loot due to uniqueness or other factor, you will get a chat message letting you know what the item was that you passed rolling on.<br />
The raid panels that have been pulled out into the gamefield should save their option settings between sessions now.<br />
If a player is looting a corpse and there are one or more items on it that player cannot loot, the player will still be able to see those items (although not able to loot them). This only is for green or better quality items. The cases this should affect are for the profession recipes that only a player of that profession can loot or when master looter is on and there is a threshold or better item on the corpse.<br />
NPC's with level appropriate quests will now always appear on your minimap as yellow exclamation points. NPC's that have quests that you have completed will now display as yellow question marks instead of yellow dots. In addition flight masters that you have not yet gotten the flight point for will display on the minimap as a green exclamation point.<br />
Npc's will display an icon on mouseover that gives a more specific indicator of their function rather than just a gossip bubble. Questgivers will now show a question mark as their in game mouseover, Innkeepers will show a hearthstone as their in game mouseover and so on.<br />
You can now pull the list of players in a channel out into the gamefield by clicking and dragging the channel name onto the gamefield. This list will show all the players in the channel sorted by voice chat status.<br />
Voice chat will now display the nameplate for who is talking when you are in a chat group. Currently it only displays the nameplate when you are in a party/raid.<br />
When multiple people are talking in a voice chat session, it will show the names of up to four people who are talking at the same time.<br />
Many On Use items now display the cooldown in the item tooltip.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World Environment<br />
Creature AI has been changed to no longer prioritize attacking unfeared targets over feared targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
(1) Reverse cooldowns are correctly refreshed when a buff is reapplied by another player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, i understand that many people don't show the pet bar or rarely use it. But what about people who use addons to replace their standard action bars now? I only show very few buttons with cooldowns and have all other hidden. Imo its much easier to just show the pet bar. Hope they change this back.<br />

Just lol at all the alliance warriors crying about fear ward nerf long enough.<br />
<br />
All the other stuff looks kinda nice.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RevanAD</div><div class="date">2007-10-23, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep... such an inconspicuous little note in there, with huge implications for druid and paladin tanks. I was pretty surprised when I noticed it.<br />
<br />
It was pretty obvious that this was going to have to happen eventually. With a 4th tanking class coming in WotLK, Fear Ward on a 3-minute cooldown and Tremor Totem unreliable, it wouldn't make sense to continue to allow fearing bosses to be totally impossible for, say, a small guild with no warrior tank doing a 10-man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
# Silence effects now have diminishing returns when used on PvP targets.<br />
# You can now obtain a tiny Sporebat pet with exalted Sporeggar faction.<br />
# An Azure Whelp pet now drops from the blue dragonkin in Azshara. <br />

<br />
Rogues<br />
<br />
# Sap: Multiple Saps placed by multiple Rogues will now be handled correctly in all cases.<br />
<br />
The silence change is pretty huge for PvP paladins. The creature AI change as already mentioned by a few people is also fairly great for paladins and druids. Also means a good stance dancing warrior will still have an edge in those fights while no longer being as desirable as they are now, nice fix it has to be said.</div></div><hr />

Well, Pummel isn't and can't be a silence, and Kick only if talented. Only talented Counterspell's silence period would be affected as well, of course. But yes, anything that's a silence would put a DR on anything else that's a silence.</div></div><hr />
