Patch 2.4 XP Changes - WotLK preview ?<br />
It looks like a change went unnoticed on the 2.4 PTRs, Blizzard changed the XP required to level up at ... 70 ! Before the patch players needed 814,700 XP to level to 71, but since tuesday you need about 50% more xp to reach this level, bringing the total to 1,256,500 XP. According to a few reports this change was made because of an interface bug but increasing the max xp by 50k or 100k would have been enough to fix it, this leaves us with another theory : leveling in WotLK will require 50% more xp than what you needed in BC, it wouldn't be surprising and would be equal to the same difference of XP between Burning Crusade and WoW classic. <br />

Europe - Arena Tournament opening time<br />
As we’ve moved into Daylight Saving Time since the publication of the Arena Tournament Official Competition Rules, we’d like to clarify that the intended opening time for the Arena Tournament is 10:00 GMT, i.e. 12:00 (noon) CEST (Paris time) and thus 11:00 BST (London time).<br />
<br />
Update 12:20 CEST: There has been a delay in opening the tournament realms. We will update you with new information as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
2.4 - PvP Rewards and Tabards<br />
The 2.4 Changes compilation was big and as expected I forgot to mention a few things, and of course there are probably a lot of them but let's start with PvP rewards and tabards. (Note : This part of the news might be updated later today, because I feel like I forgot something important.) <br />
<br />
PvP Rewards<br />
Spell haste necklaces and rings have been added to the game. <br />
[item=35317]<br />
[item=35319]<br />
[item=35320]<br />

<br />
Tabards<br />
Three tabards have been added in patch 2.4, the first one is already available and is the .<br />

<br />
There are also two other tabards, the [item=35279] and [item=35280]. They are available during the Midsummer Fire Festival (http://www.wowwiki.com/Midsummer_Fire_Festival) and will be rewarded after you complete the quest you get from [item=35723] dropping from Lord Ahune (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/lordahune2.jpg), the daily quest mini-boss introduced for the 2008 version of this event. <br />

Telia resolves internet dispute with Cogent<br />
[i]The internet traffic dispute between Telia Sonera and US-based Cogent Communications has been resolved. A new contract has been signed between the two firms and affected customers have regained full access to the internet.<br />
<br />
&quot;We are happy to have signed a new contract with Cogent and regret that some of our customers have been affected by the dispute,&quot; said Malin Frenning CEO of Telia Sonera International Carrier, Dagens Nyheter (DN) writes.<br />
<br />
The dispute began at around 11pm on March 13th when Cogent decided to cut off communications with Telia Sonera in protest at the &quot;degraded&quot; service it claimed was experienced by its customers. By 6.30pm on Friday the connection was re-established and Cogent customers in the USA could once again access sites hosted by Telia, such as World of Warcraft.<br />

<br />
No... it's just an obvious progression. The number after 60 is 61, so a lot more XP. The number after 70 is 71, so obviously a lot more XP...<br />
&gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
They will still reset rested XP. It's just stupid to fly through the first new cities and not actually explore anything at all.</div></div><hr />

Melee haste doesn't do this, so it's not as &quot;zomg awesome.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
we get armor penetration, which for the people who are going to bring it up is not even close to spell pen. also outside of tbc very few things existed that gave spell haste. melee haste has existed forever (flurry, slice n dice, counterweights).<br />
<br />
what is sad is that some people have compared spell haste to being the new spell crit in arenas, much like stacking attack power + armor pen is a way around resilience for melee. would be sad if this change was propelled by resilience, but i think it will present a huge dps boost for casters in pve.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leonidas</div><div class="date">2008-03-31, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you think about it, leveling 60-70 in the Outlands for most people - they never went to Netherstorm or SMV until they were already maxed 70. I know for both my characters I hit 70 during the first half of BEM, no real instance running included (absolutely none the second time). Therefore, all questing after that was only really for monetary purposes due to increased money as a reward. I personally thought it wasn't even a challenge to get to 70 from 60. I'm kinda glad if they're going to slow down the pace from 70 to 80, give people time to enjoy the zones in a leveling fashion. <br />
<br />
Only the people that got stuck on quests, or just skipped around doing whatever they found in a frenzy to level to 70 seem to be quite bored with the game fairly quickly and aren’t really motivated enough to quest strictly for gold. I’m hoping they will make it so that you have to experience every area and at least casually run instances in order to ding 80... The BC age turned out so many people that knew nothing about running instances or completing complex quest lines that it’s sad. Hopefully the jump to 80 will have more of a difficulty to the leveling scheme, bettering the players for endgame content w/o the “pre-BC raiding” experience.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beckers</div><div class="date">2008-04-01, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">cmon u cry babies u cried in 60-61 ur allways gonna cry. but ur still level 70 now.<br />
im so glad i saved my quests in netherstorm and shadowmoon.i can start questing there and not waste norhrend quests<br />
<br />
and get proly tons of gold since im above 70 :)<br />
<br />
another nice trick is doing 25 quests and handing them in when the expansion starts. did that in silithus in level 60<br />
when TBC came out i was 61 in no time just handing everything i did in. gives u a nice start.</div></div><hr />
