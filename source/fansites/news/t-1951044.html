Legion - System Requirements<br />
New system requirements were recently posted and we took a look at how they compare to the old ones. &lt;span title=&quot;to do laps around Dalaran&quot;&gt;If you are ready to upgrade&lt;/span&gt;, you can take a look at our latest Setup of the Month (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5472-Legion-Resto-Druid-Artifact-Intro-Achievement-Search-Tweets-Setup-of-the-Month) or ask for assistance on the Computer Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer). <br />
<br />
Mac requirements are listed on the Legion (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-legion) and Warlords (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/300493) system requirement pages. Notable increases include the minimum CPU going from a Core2 Duo to i5-750, as well as the minimum (2GB to 4GB) and recommended (4GB to 8GB) RAM being increased. <br />
<br />
Minimum<br />
<br />
Intel CPU: Intel Core2 Duo E6600 increased to Intel Core2 Duo E8500<br />
AMD CPU: AMD Phenom X3 8750 increased to AMD Phenom II X3 720<br />
Drive Space: 35 GB increased to 45 GB.<br />
Nvidia GPU: 8800 GT increased to GT 440<br />
AMD GPU: Radeon HD 4850 increased to Radeon HD 5670<br />
Intel GPU: HD Graphics 3000 increased to HD Graphics 5000<br />
<br />
<br />
Recommended<br />
<br />
Operating System: Windows 7, 8, or 10 increased to Windows 10.<br />
Intel CPU: Intel Core i5-2400 increased to Intel Core i5-3330<br />
AMD CPU: AMD FX-4100 increased to AMD FX-6300<br />
Nvidia GPU: GTX 470 increased to GTX 750 Ti<br />
AMD GPU: Radeon HD 5870 increased to R7 260X<br />
<br />
<br />
The system requirements for Legion are much higher than the requirements for Warlords of Draenor. Make sure your computer meets these requirements before purchasing the Legion expansion.<br />

Warlords of Draenor - All Character Achievements Complete<br />
Players are keeping busy while waiting for Legion, with several players completing all of the possible character achievements. Congratulations to Arpexia of Thrall-EU (http://www.wowprogress.com/character/eu/thrall/Arpexia) and the others that followed. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Is the 5.3 bickering between the Alliance PC and Vol'jin canon? It seems OOC of Vol'jin to threaten in the manner that he did.<br />
Definitely canon. And besides, Alliance players who called his bluff when he threatened could make him back down. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/697652193592102916))<br />
<br />
.I can repeat the Bodhi Pet Battle world quest over and over on same toon. Received rewards every time. Intended?? #LegionAlpha<br />
it's a bug, new tech not quite ready to unleash PB quests officially, but feel free to give feedback as you find them! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/697833959342764033))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
I still have not forgiven you for that article and never will! You slapped a lot of players in the face!<br />
I explained our intent that you coordinate with a team and don't just AE everything. I've never quite understood that controversy (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694902946895495168))<br />
Maybe it was the title? I wanted to echo the surprise players likely after LK's dungeon zergs but maybe it sounded patronizing? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694903212499800065))<br />
<br />
I strongly disliked the logic that &quot;players can't do this&quot;. The drive to improve has steadily been quashed.<br />
For me games are about overcoming obstacles, whether it's Dark Souls, League or the Witness. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694904390960852992))<br />
I enjoy walking my dogs in the morning, but I'm really not looking for a challenge there. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694904111964106752))<br />
I believe players *can* do something, but I think for many they maybe weren't looking for that in a game. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694903912403333120))<br />
But maybe some players want the equivalent of the dog walk, at least sometimes? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/694904520187334656))<br />

In my case i have to turn the graphics down on the Alpha, especially the Viewing Distance ( its like 10x higher than in WOD ) , it really depends on the Scenery but its definetly more demanding than WOD iam afraid.</div></div><hr />

Goes without saying that you'll have no problems running it if you can run WoD. Increased requirements cover additions and enhancements (View distance, lighting quality, texture resolution), which almost certainly are optional.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think I'll still be able to run the new high resolutions? I won't be increasing view distance, I don't need to see further than it goes now anyways. I also leave shadows and lighting on medium usually, although I might try to up the lighting a bit.</div></div><hr />

Gz Arpexia for being #1 and thank you for taking your time to explain it to me. Too bad blizzard fucked it up with giving alliance an extra achievement to which we have no counterpart. Why does wowprogress.com list it that way thought? This SHOULD be fixed imo.</div></div><hr />

Problem is everything keeps evolving. Hell in Vanilla you could run the game on Windows 98/ME with an Intel pentium 3 and like 512MB of RAM. Even then it ran like garbage. It also used to run on Voodoo cards.</div></div><hr />

Well the option is there for them to upgrade. There are capable WoW builds for around less than £500 these days so just save a bit here and there. No game can have the same requirements forever if it's constantly getting a bit of polish here and there. I can imagine newer MMO's will improve their graphics over time as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it can, on my 680 which is essentially a 770 and is significantly faster than a 750ti which is the recommended by blizzar it holds steady 60 fps on full ultra with 4x msaa and cmaa on top inside dungeons and there was no noticable change during raiding as well from the few raid tests that i participated.

What's wrong with a toaster? I started off playing wow on a toaster which was ran by dying hamsters. Though you don't need max setting to play the game. Well ofc if you play and enjoy the shadows, ripples, god-rays and such then lowering the setting to improve performance will be pita for someone like that.<br />

As it's under recommended setting anyway and the win10 free upgrade period will be over by summer as well (as say some, though people at work say different :P) then I guess it's a valid demand for recommended settings.<br />
But, you are saying that bnet app doesn't work in win10 right now?<br />
<br />
Just not that hyped about win10, cause the &quot;proper customization&quot; to get all the unneeded applications turned off will take extra time when setting the OS up.... On the other hand I do need to check my toaster's settings as well, maybe I miss the mark under the recommended settings with my gpu or cpu *gasp*</div></div><hr />

It was actually ment as a joke. As i remember back a few years when people thought you needed a really good PC for playing Wow.<br />
<br />
I don't have what i wrote, i just thought of something i knew was a great and way too overpowered for Wow :P<br />
<br />
my Pc does have a 980 tho, but not a Ti and definitely not Sli ;'(<br />
<br />
my pc specs are: 4690k @ 4,2ghz, 16GB DDR3 2400mhz, 250gb 840 SSD, 980 Msi.<br />

- stable 40-60fps on ultra with x4 MSAA and SSAO disabled, shadows on Good while in Dalaran on the Alpha/Beta. (Consistent 60fps with shadows disabled)<br />
- running around Val'sharah with shadows on Good = stable 60fps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2016-02-17, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That increase is unfortunate. My brother's computer has the minimum Intel processor as it is (Core2 Duo E6600) and due to the age, he can't really get anything higher. Mine's an i5 3870K if I recall. He has a hard time in HFC as it is so Legion will likely kill his computer. Both of us have the HD Radeon 7770 card so we're above minimum with that. The CPU screws him, though. I was planning to upgrade our computers later this year anyway, but I didn't think I'd HAVE to upgrade if I wanted to keep playing WoW. Figured I'd save on parts once Black Friday and Cyber Monday hit. Guess that only cements us waiting until closer to December to get Legion, though. Certainly gives time to see if Legion's really worth anything or is WoD 2.0.<br />
<br />
Have to say I'm confused on the Vol'jin and PC conversation, too, though. O.o Don't recall seeing that anywhere. Or was that part of the Barrens thing and thus got removed so if you missed it, you're out of luck? I was on a break when that was going on.</div></div><hr />

Confirmed. Windows 10 is fine. They've brought back a more power-user oriented interface for it. It crashes less than the &quot;gold standard&quot; windows 7 (I mean so did windows 8 and 8.1 but at least you could legitimately gripe that the GUI sucked for power users).<br />
<br />
I think you can even skip the microsoft account integration if you wanted to, but you're just needlessly inconveniencing yourself for the sake of privacy paranoia.<br />
<br />
I'd definitely recommend doing manual privacy settings when installing it though.</div></div><hr />

I'm in the Alpha, and at the moment you can't play with old character models.<br />

There is still the option in the advanced graphics setting to &quot;show new character models&quot; but it doesn't matter wether you check that box or not you can only see the new character models...</div></div><hr />

You must go to some really dodgy websites then to be worried about that :). Also unless a forced update bricks your system you don't really have anything to worry about and it's usually just updates to Defender or the same stuff you got from 7/8.1.

Your cpu will be fine for sure - I have a recently built similar system, only with a GTX 960 instead, and I run it on ultra at steady 60fps even in 20man raiding.<br />

<br />
However, relatively few people will want to upgrade their machine just for WoW. Sure, for people who maintain a gaming PC, eh. But for people who play on a computer that's used for other stuff, it's not as clear cut. This is particularly true for those of us playing on laptops. Mine has an HD5000 integrated GPU so it's OK on WoD (not great, but OK). In Legion... it probably won't be since it's now the min required.

Don't need anything to hide to have issues with privacy. I'm sure you have nothing to hide but would probably be uncomfortable with cameras being placed around your house.<br />

I don't like updates being forced on me. I've had issues in the past where I wiped the raid because windows decided mid pull it wanted to do something.

Hate to tell you but there isn't gonna be a 12. 10 is gonna be updated indefinitely. I mean yeah they could basically make a whole new OS out of 10 at some point but from what I've read there isn't gonna be a Windows 11, 12 etc.</div></div><hr />

No, most likely not. The processor is very much under the spec, as well as you having no dedicated graphics. 4GB of RAM is also pretty anemic. If you are in the market for a new gaming laptop on the cheap, I would recommend any laptop with a nvidia GTX 960m or above graphics card.

On topic, this is what put me off SLI when I built my rig in 2012, suddenly realising every gpu upgrade would double up.

<br />
I don't like the thought of switching from 7 to 10 as I find 8 &amp; 10 on friends laptops to be similar to a smart phone with apps and gawd knows what. I stayed with xp for a long time for similar reasons<br />

Be interesting to see if others games manufacturers start optimizing for 10<br />

You have a point about very rarely win 10 updates bricking a system. The problem is this was also an issue on win 8 and win 7 and people had the issue their as well. You are not safe just because you hide your head in the sand and claim your current OS protects you, the simple fact is those issues affect such a tiny number of overall users that its just not a realistic reason to avoid something. Its like not buying a new hard drive because they generally have a 2-3 percent failure rate.

Many ppl did all achievements every expansion. So this is not actually true. This is like any other sport: you have a goal and you go to it. Also if you are experienced person all this points not a problem at all. Because most of them (which was hard) ppl did several years ago. And WoD achieves are simple. The only reason why all points was closed only few weeks ago is achieve for 27k conquest points. Which cannot be done faster than 3+ months. All this month ppl relaxing and played like 1h per week for points. That's all. Not so big effort and waste of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Witcher is a 2015 game OPTIMIZED to systems of today's. Wow is a 2004 game that still uses a massively modified Warcraft 3 engine. TERA and FFXIV are much newer than wow as well. My rig laughs around witcher3 on maximum settings, while wow dips around 40 fps when i'm derping around in my garrison. Optimization is key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People take the Recommended requirements like they are the minimum requirements. Basically if you're running WoD now you won't necessarily be topping out Legion, but it will still run. <br />
<br />
You can run WoW below the Minimum requirements, but that requires knowing what you're doing (I used to know a few good tricks to get WotLK-minimum setups working in Cata; they didn't quite work in MoP though), which is why they're the Minimum requirements.</div></div><hr />

Steadily can do 30FPS when recording and 40-50FPS outside of that in 30+ people raid. Maybe lessening some graphic setting might be in order when the game starts to cut too much into the general performance during streaming/recording, but then again I have never been much of &quot;pretty visual junky&quot; so it should be more then fine.<br />
<br />
My toaster is as follows with all stock: <br />
i5-3570k | GTX650 Ti (which is said to be equivelent to the 750Ti) | 8Gbs of RAM | 256 gb SSD and for stuff storage a 1TB HDD)<br />
<br />
Hopefully I don't have to fiddle around too much with the settings to find what is suitable for me, but as long as game works in raid without having to watch a slideshow when recording/streaming - all is good.<br />

I ran wow on PC and laptop(s) which even didn't scrape the minimum system requirements, the game play will suffer, but you still are able to play. Hell playing over 3G to 4G mobile connection works fine (most of the time) though Blizzard doesn't support (as far as I've been told by a GM) that much of the G-networks.</div></div><hr />

They are probably assuming that it is only a valid reason to ask win10 as recommended.<br />
Though I do agree win10 adds nothing (to those who don't care much about your OS looking and acting like a tablet (with decent tweaking you can get your &quot;old windows back&quot; somehow)) but the DX12 support which as someone said some place earlier probably won't be added as main DX from start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the way the engine and graphics have evolved the last couple of expansions + the experiences gained from implementing DX11 there's no reason they wouldn't be pushing for it. <br />
<br />
And from a tech-support point of view, having as many people as possible on the same platform makes a lot of sense. People are still sending error reports from Win XP.</div></div><hr />

They are adding support for Apple's Metal API so I'd say seeing support for DX12 in say patch 7.1 is likely although not guaranteed. <br />

Recommending Windows 10 might still make sense regardless, since they probably will focus their own QA towards the newest platform.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do not understand computers at all do you? It has nothing to do with the number of cores. It is about how powerful the individual cores are, and I am pretty sure that single and dual cores CPUs are not much of a thing anymore. Hence why the new requirements call for newer, stronger CPUs.</div></div><hr />

Why the hell would I care to have 8 cores unless I am streaming, playing porn, listening to music, and playing WoW all at the same time. So unless the game engine has been redone, rebuilt, replaced, or improved in some way. There is little to know reason to increase the processor or cores required.<br />
<br />
The graphical database is higher resolution, the game is still polished, and the engine identical, but rendering specific locations in game will cause heavy load on a 6 year old system. Blizzard really pushed 64-bit in the right direction, it runs much better even on old systems, but the fact still stands: Legion has a lot of updates, and the processor, graphics cards, and ram are required to be faster if you want the new zones to look smooth, and be the way blizzard designed it to be, you're going to have to update the 6 year old computers.<br />
<br />
Obviously new computers release all the time now that aren't as good at what's required even for WoW, but again - it's a Video Game. You're not going to play Legion with all the updated awesomeness on an integrated system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps don't assume it is about the multiple core utilisation, but more about the architecture or the single-core performance that tends to come with the increased requirements.<br />
WoW has NEVER had good multi-threading support, and have seen no discussions or evidence to suggest that Legion is any different.<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that multiple cores are quickly becoming the norm, they are vastly underutilised in virtually all games, and even at the core of the OS.<br />
So actually it would be welcome were there better support, though support doesn't necessarily mean a requirement.<br />
<br />
Though there has obviously been a good reason for the lowest end requirements, in that it represents a lot of customers.<br />
I do fear that raising the requirements could lose them subscribers.<br />
Time will tell (no alpha yet) as to what the experience is on my system, given how mine is not a lot above minimum on many parts even with a graphics card upgrade about a year or so ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only reason this game is more popular is the ability for everyone with toasters to play it. Subs should be decreasing like crazy soon.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are by no means the only MMO developer to support (currently) as far back as the 8800GT or similar cards.<br />
It is disappointing that they can't better utilise the hardware that is already there, given how even multi-threading could potentially offer good improvements.<br />
<br />
If that does drop sub numbers as I suspect, then maybe it will give them the incentive to take a good hard look at the performance.</div></div><hr />

It's their own fault. They flat out ignore topics and tweets with intelligent well thought out ideas and criticisms and post in topics that are whiny temper tantrums. You spend any amount of time on their forums or their twitter and you'll know this.<br />

We should be hearing about Blizzard's game's progress and their future, not how they once were. That's the point of this &quot;news&quot; site right?<br />

True, ever since that twitter handle was created to communicate with players, it seems the vast majority of verbal devs in the past went silent. GC being gone for a while now manages to talk more about the state of the game than current devs.</div></div><hr />

Just x99? Not even Z10PE? - you suck<br />
Just 5930k? Not even Xeon E5 2690? - you suck<br />
Just 16gb and 512gb? - you suck<br />
2x GTX980 Ti - that's about average<br />
<br />
&quot;you suck&quot; - 4 out of 5, &quot;average&quot; 1 out of 5 - Total: YOU SUCK<br />
<br />
I guess it was too hard for you to read the comments.<br />
<br />
But lets face it, if you're dumb enough to actually buy a xenon CPU for wow, you really shouldn't reply on this stuff. And if i actually had 2x 980ti's its definitly not &quot;average&quot;. The 512gb would be the OS disk+games, and 512gb more than enough + extra. Noones uses 16gb of ram in a new game today unless its å server etc. So yeah.<br />
<br />
Tips for the future: Try to actually read the comments, dont comment on shit you have 0 clue about.<br />

It's just recommended not required. You can still stick to XP, 7 and 8.1 if you want. It's not like Morhaime and Metzen are gonna come round to your house and make you upgrade :). Or are they? :O</div></div><hr />

<br />
And your point is? If they have the same performance, I would say that they 2400 falls into their requirements listed. System requirements is a guideline. It is not to say that a previous generation CPU does not meet the requirements.</div></div><hr />

Over the years of monitoring this business you might have noticed that these open source platform independent solutions don't necessarily become the norm. They look great while selling off their pros to consumers, but developers end up dreading them for the lack of back-end support and inconsistencies with how they behave with different hardware. DX12 has the microsoft powerhouse of support staff and documentation behind it and is likely to be the hugely adopted API as it always has been.</div></div><hr />

I didn't want to go to Win 8, EVER. Win 10 fixed a LOT of the shit, and you will be 100% fine driving from Win 7 to Win 10, PLUS it's better on security, and a TON better working with your hardware from Win 7 100% - just make sure you make at LEAST 2 backups of all of your stuff before even thinking of upgrading to Win 10.. just in case something bad happens.<br />

2x980ti: hahaha right before the 1080s come out. considering one 1080 outperforms two 980ti and is cheaper, tough luck man. plus wow doesn't take advantage of SLI. grats on your wasted money.<br />
<br />
Overall: you bought a nice e-peen extension. your flaunting of specs make me wonder the same thing i wonder about guys driving vettes and porches and hummers. what exactly is it overcompensating for?<br />
<br />
<br />
inb4 &quot;what do you have then you poor smuck?! lol bet its a potato&quot;<br />
<br />
well, boards a sabertooth 990fx r2.0 mounted in a white NZXT H440.<br />
Procs an FX-8370, OC to 4.7ghz.<br />
16gb ddr3, two 120gb sata SSD (one OS, one games), one TB HDD (storage).<br />
Sapphire R9 285 (Approximates to a gtx 960 or 950.)<br />
<br />
Bring on the hate about AMD. and how its &quot;bad&quot; but here's the thing. i meet Legion recommended (easily). my build ran me about 1500 cdn to do it. yours? lets see.... basing off canadian dollar, and an x99 board with an m.2, gskill ram (the more common ram), Asus rog gpus (the choice for people with more money than sense), use my case as the baseline, assume a HDD for storage... bit over four grand. for something you'll never, ever, EVER, EVER utilize more than a fifth of the power of. then there's the power requirement for that setup.... enjoy tacking another 200 bucks onto your monthly power bill for that kilowatt psw you're using. <br />
<br />
so, what ARE you overcompensating for? cause its a pretty big overcompensation.<br />
<br />

<br />
i hope i can still play my chars with the old graphics..<br />
<br />
can anyone in the alpha confirm this?<br />
<br />
You absolutely can not.<br />
Legion removes the option to use old models for player characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get 100+ on my rig and it's much lower than his. But some people seem to get shit FPS on stupid powerful machines.<br />
<br />
Well, part of the problem is SLI/Crossfire and the inconsistent support games have for it.</div></div><hr />

You could get an AMD 250x for pretty cheap($50ish) it would be a cheap option to make sure you meet the minimums and then some.</div></div><hr />

they also write, make sure that you meet the requirements before purchasing legion..<br />
<br />

Your doing something wrong then <br />
Im on ultra settings <br />
i5 6400<br />
gtx 750ti<br />
32gigs ddr 4 <br />
100fps.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm confused. I don't even see a i5 7500 on the Intel website. 6600 is the highest it gets.<br />
I literally three days ago got the i5 6600k 3.5 ghz , 6m processor at the suggestion of this website for the unicorn build. <br />
This is my first self build so I don't know much about computers. Does this mean my processor is crap now?<br />
<br />
<br />
nope your fine 6th gen out perform i7 5th gen processors even at I5-6600...</div></div><hr />

hehe and the fun about the internet is.. so many salty replies.. so many biting on it:P<br />
<br />
Atm my pc is not close to this but its not bad either:P i5 6600k @ 4,6ghz, 16gb DDR4 @3200mhz, GTX 1070 @2051mhz... even with these specs in the new zones in the beta i get 50fps some places :S (everything on ultra, wich means 10 in legion)</div></div><hr />

I'm running a 6th gen i7 and 960 at 2560x1080. On WoD, I max out and never drop below 40fps. On the PTR, I'm at 11fps and don't rise above 40fps until I'm at worse settings than I'm running in WoD.</div></div><hr />
