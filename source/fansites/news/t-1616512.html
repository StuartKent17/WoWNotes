Warlords of Draenor - Vicious War Ram<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Vicious War Ram (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/116777-vicious-war-ram). This is the new Alliance PvP mount in Patch 6.0.2, sold by Necrolord Sipe (http://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/73190-necrolord-sipe) for Vicious Saddle (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/103533-vicious-saddle). If you don't already have a saddle, you can get one from the Primal Combatant (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9238-primal-combatant) achievement when Warlords of Draenor launches.<br />

Group Finder Listing Cap Increased<br />
One of the bigger complaints about the group finder was the cap of 25 groups visible at once. This was increased in a hotfix to 100 groups. Right now that still won't cover the ~150-200 groups listed during the evening, but you can refresh the list or search to narrow down the results.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Free Game Time Promotion<br />
If you are thinking about coming back for Warlords of Draenor, a free week of game time went out today. It appears to work for many players right now, even adding a week of game time to active accounts.<br />
<br />
EU players may need to try twice or look under the Referrals &amp; Rewards section in their WoW account in account management. <br />

Alliance and the Wickerman<br />
I asked one of our designers (@Muffinus) if he knew why it was set up this way. The original designer that worked on it isn't here any more so we're not sure if more changes were planned but didn't get made, or what, but he agreed there's some obvious inconsistency with it versus the Alliance Wickerman. It's not something we can hotfix or get changes into a patch that would release before this year's holiday is over, but in the future, guard rage will be significantly reduced, and it will no longer flag you for PvP when entering the area. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/346413-alliance-has-it-bad-for-the-wickerman/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14995329429?page=1#11))<br />
<br />
Brown Orc Skin<br />
We do think offering some other skin options is a pretty cool idea (Dark Iron dwarves? Brown orcs?) but our priority is still the updates to the features that already exist--the blood elf update is in-progress--as well as prioritizing some tasks based on feedback to all the model updates that went out in 6.0.2. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/346392-brown-orcs-should-happen/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15006940559?page=1#3))<br />

PvE<br />
With the current situation with UBRS being level 100 only, is there any way to get attuned to BWL for those who weren't?<br />
You should be able to just use the orb no matter what. Inability to do as a ghost is a bug that's being fixed. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/523864476143992833))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
when forming pvp group finder cannot que while still looking. Bug or working as intended?<br />
This is intended. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/523309463206256640))<br />
hmm sad face. I spent 20 minutes with a terribad today without the ability to find a replacement.<br />
Perhaps something we'll consider in the future but didn't want people joining groups but looking for another one. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/523315675662532610))<br />
<br />
does the trinket bonus even do anything for you anymore? resilience is out of the game right?<br />
We just aren't putting it on new gear (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/523310813981847553))<br />
so getting it right now is worth it? the res still works?<br />
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/523317192108949504))<br />

Why do Alliance players have to flag for pvp and face level ?? guards to do the wickerman quest?<br />
Because it is a PvP quest. Horde players have one as well. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/523600829719121920))<br />
Horde players don't have to flag because the Alliance wickerman is outside the city. Going in ruins of lordaeron forces flag.<br />
Hm... that's an oversight. On a PvP realm you're flagged either way. Sadly, I don't see a fix for PvE realms this year. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/523610311878639616))<br />
<br />
<br />
The Horde Chopper is Here<br />
Patch 6.0.2 added the Horde Chopper, but no word on when the Alliance Chopper is going to show up yet.<br />
With the recent release of Patch 6.0.2, players who logged in to claim their Horde chopper between July 24, 2014 through September 30, 2014 can now get on their bike and ride. The Warlord's Deathwheel can be found within the Mounts tab(Shift-P in collections) and can be ridden by Horde characters with the appropriate riding skill.<br />

Costume Gallery Update<br />
With Blizzcon only a few weeks away, Blizzard has updated the costume gallery (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/media/costumes/?page=1) with some new costumes!<br />

Read my thread that I posted, it has far-more information on the subject. Link to thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1616400-7-Days-Free!-WoD-Marketing-move)<br />

Can someone explain me why on earth can't/wont they go over the 100 groups-cap? OQ's limit lay a lot higher. Surely this is not OQ and its using a different system etc, but still. Sounds more to me like they don't want to increase it on purpose for some reason.</div></div><hr />

I think it has something to do with lag which can occur from thousands of users querying the Group Finder at once. It's probably extremely intensive on the server.</div></div><hr />

100 Isn't too bad but first they need to improve that terrible search, it doesn't let you filter well.</div></div><hr />

Less is more. If you have more than a hundred groups to scroll through it's hard to find what you need. Obviously they could just make better filters and sorting mechanisms but you know Blizzard :).</div></div><hr />

Worked for me on a frozen eu account. I clicked the link, it asked me to sign in and I went to my bnet page, with account still frozen.<br />
<br />
Then I closed that window and clicked link a second time (so im still signed in) and this time it gave me the option to add 7 days. Account now reads cancelled with 7 days remaining rather than frozen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The lack of details its overwhelming, a piercing and a horn to the side dont make this awe inspiring, it could have a broken horn, replaced with spikes, the little fluffy knots on the forehead could be spikes or blades, the horn themselves could have saw blades or something, anything! the human horse has the HEADS of fallen orcs and trolls, and the cat has a sick armor a a shuriken on its tail, this fells just incomplete and halfassed, and dont get me started on the color, white and green? yeah, really vicious...<br />
<br />
The horde raptor at least has 2 skull with flaming eyes mounted on, and blades on its mouth and tail, that and a cool looking armor, we got a white and green ram, with a nose piercing and a blowhorn on one side, sent it back and give me something awesome :mad:</div></div><hr />

If you have more than a hundred groups to scroll through it's hard to find what you need. Obviously they could just make better filters and sorting mechanisms but you know Blizzard :).<br />
<br />
They could fix a lot by just limiting the search to the group names only. Currently it includes the raid name, group name, and bosses available in that raid. For example, if you're trying to find a garrosh-only group and you search &quot;garrosh&quot; you will find all SoO raids. If you search &quot;Malkorok&quot; you find all SoO raids. If you search &quot;Paragons&quot;... you get the point. If you search for &quot;garry&quot; it is only raids with garry in the name.</div></div><hr />

Why is it more fitting than updating the iconic mounts we've had for 10 years...? They apply to way more players than the PVP mounts at that with players having a racial mount WAY before they ever get close to a pvp one. <br />
