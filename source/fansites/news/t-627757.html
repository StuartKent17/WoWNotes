IRVINE, Calif. - December 23, 2008 - Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that World of Warcraft®, its award-winning subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game, is now played by more than 11.5 million subscribers worldwide. This new high was reached following the November 13 release of the game’s second expansion, Wrath of the Lich King™.<br />
<br />
Within its first 24 hours of availability, Wrath of the Lich King sold more than 2.8 million copies, making it the fastest-selling PC game of all time. In addition to winning a number of editor’s choice awards from major gaming publications, the expansion has now gone on to sell more than 4 million copies in its first month, setting a new record for monthly PC-game sales. Both sales records were previously held by World of Warcraft's first expansion, The Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
“We’re pleased to welcome the new and returning players who have helped World of Warcraft reach these new milestones, and we appreciate the enthusiasm and support that the game’s global community has continued to show,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “We look forward to providing all of them with an excellent entertainment experience for a long time to come.”<br />
<br />
“Not only is Wrath of the Lich King still doing well, the base World of Warcraft game and the World of Warcraft Battle Chest® are performing better than last year,” said Bob McKenzie, senior vice president of merchandising at GameStop. “That type of traction is very impressive for a game that is going into its fifth holiday season and speaks to the enthusiastic player base Blizzard Entertainment products have.”<br />

Target DPS for each class<br />
From our perspective, we don't want to tell you how much dps you should be doing and don't want to make it too easy for you to figure out how much dps you can do. It depends greatly on situation to situation, and on your gear, skill and the comp of your group.<br />
<br />
I also think it takes a little of the fun out of the game if the numbers are posted and made official for everyone to see. The discovery aspect adds a lot of depth to the game.<br />

&quot;Vehicle&quot; mounts<br />
Yep it was me. All vehicle-style mounts will be changed to function as normal mounts, which should theoretically alleviate many issues people have with them. When? Probably 3.1 but this isn't confirmed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/7346384986-travelers-tundra-mammoth.html))<br />

Class balancing in WotLK<br />
We overhauled the classes for LK moreso than BC and introduced a new class for the first time. Also remember that when BC launched, nobody knew what Arenas were or what they would do to PvP (or the microscope under which they place cass balance). I also think we have just been more open this time around. Certainly we didn't address the community with this degree of candor when BC launched.<br />
<br />
You have to realize that Blizzard is it's own worst critic. From our point of view, we can always improve every aspect of the game. When we talk about bugs or things we still want to work on, that doesn't mean we shipped the game before we were ready. It means that we hold ourselves to a very high standard, honestly a lot higher than most of the players do. If there is something that annoys you about the game, it almost certainly drives us nuts.<br />
<br />
WoW is a gigantic game with a huge player base. Please don't mistake our open discussion about things we would like to improve as our feeling that Lich King is in any way a failure. We are enormously proud of it and most players I speak to are having a blast. (Most of those players aren't the ones posting on forums.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13908722412-from-blackthorne-to-warhammer-and-back.html))<br />
<br />
New roles forums (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13593899856-gc-would-you-consider-these-forums-a-success.html))<br />
If it's a class specific issue, then the class forums may be a better place for that. They are useful for questions such as: What spec should I use? What glyphs should I use? What gear do I want? How do I beat a Frost mage?<br />
<br />
The reason we launched these forums is increasingly we'd see a thread where someone would say &quot;Our class is the worst. Everyone agrees.&quot; Then someone from another class would post &quot;Um, you are exaggerating&quot; and the first class would respond &quot;GET OUTTA OUR FORUM INTERLOPER!&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet, we think there is a lot of benefit of having different classes talk to each other. Sure it's going to get heated sometimes, but it also can offer a lot of perspective to you and to us. The start of the Arena season brought out a lot of (often redundant) posts on this and the healing forum, but that shouldn't be a huge surprise. Overall, I think these forums have evolved nicely from their initial launch.<br />
<br />
Since I'm up on a soapbox already, here are my suggestions for getting the most out of them:<br />
<br />
Talk to other players. The worst threads are the ones asking for blue responses and ignoring any response that isn't blue.<br />
Don't spam, troll or QQ. I know a lot of players are used to that from other forums. We don't want it here. You are welcome to disagree with our design decisions, and many players do, but you need to do it in a mature, intelligent and civil fashion.<br />
Don't waste other players' time. Don't post about how much Blizzard hates your class or how you feel neglected or how you wish your thread got a blue response instead of some other thread. Please don't drive the smart players away.<br />
Don't expect your suggestions will get implemented. It happens, but it is very rare. Don't mistake having access to the developers here for being able to make demands. We love suggestions, but understand that the nature of how we work is that the vast majority will get filtered away.<br />
Don't get frustrated. If I can be patient, you can be patient.<br />
We read all the threads. We appreciate it when players can read a lot too. &quot;I didn't read the whole thread&quot; is a particular pet peeve of mine, because it feels like you are saying your opinion is important enough to be heard, but those of other players are not important enough for you to read them.<br />
Have fun. It's a game.<br />

Restoration druids mana issues<br />
When I see Resto druids run out of mana, it is often because they stacked spellpower and forgot about spirit, mp5 and int. On shorter fights it can be attractive, but on the longer bosses like Saph and KT, that mana pool and regen really start to count for something.

51 Point talents<br />
I think you are expecting more out of the 51-point talents than we are. The death knight may be the best example. They are useful 51 pointers, but none feel mandatory and the trees aren't balanced completely around them. Unholy Blight is probably the closest to feeling necessary, but really only for tanks.<br />
<br />
We do still think that those comments about Hunger for Blood still stand. However, it's not a simple fix because Assassination can do very high (if not the highest) dps (in a world without HaT bugs), but only for a skilled player who invests a lot of time into it and only on long fights. That means to juice up the tree in some places we'd need to nerf it in others in order to avoid Assassination becoming THE PvE spec. It is something we're working on -- just too early for any announcements. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13908722093-wtb-blue-responses.html))<br />
<br />
Rogues in WotLK<br />
The &quot;lackluster talent&quot; thing is something almost every spec throws around. In almost every case, we weren't trying to make the 51 point talent the best in the tree and we weren't trying to make the 51 something you use as part of your standard rotation.<br />
<br />
As I have said before, what we wanted to do with rogues in BC included getting poisons back into the game, making sap a more useful CC, and getting rogues to pay a little more attention to the rest of the group (with things like Tricks). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13908722093-wtb-blue-responses.html))<br />
<br />
Ranged vs. Melee DPS<br />
I do think there is a melee disadvantage, and I do think rogues are probably not quite doing the damage they should in ideal situations.<br />
<br />
Be careful with Patchwerk though. It's an ideal situation for rogues, but it's an ideal situation for any dps that doesn't have to move or run around. You need to look at the LK equivalent of Void Reaver (and I'm not sure there is one -- Grobbulus maybe) where the ranged dps have to move and the melee can more or less go crazy. Another problem with Patch is that the fights are short. You can burn all your cooldowns and have them active for a decent percentage of that fight. Rogues typically need to lay down a groundwork before they really start pumping out the dps, and they really start to shine in situations where the casters have to start worrying about mana.<br />
<br />
We knew this was the risk with introducing the combat dummies, but some players do have the tendency to generate numbers from those tests and then expect to see that dps in a raid. Usually encounters are much more complex than that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13908722093-wtb-blue-responses.html))<br />
<br />
Rogue AE changes in 3.0.8<br />
We aren't trying to turn rogues into an AE class. We just want them to have something to do in AE situations besides making Heavy Borean Leather. The new Fan works pretty well for that.<br />
<br />
We do think rogues might be a little low on single-target bosses, but we're also cognizant of the fact that they tend to do much better with good gear and good buffs. We have some plans in mind. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13908722093-wtb-blue-responses.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warrior.jpg Warrior (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=600) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br />
Developer Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13908721775-concise-questions-seeking-answers-warrior.html))<br />
1) Is generating no rage on shielded targets considered to be a balanced mechanic or are possible alternatives being considered? <br />
It's not something we think is broken. Rage is not an unalienable right. You get it when you hit things. When you hit a shielded target, you aren't hitting them. <br />
<br />
2) Is it intended for the new Arms tree to be so heavily dependant on RNG or was it maybe taken a bit to that extreme, and if so are there any plans to making the damage from that tree seem more on demand?<br />
We're okay with it for now. Various specs have more or less RNG baked into them. Fire and Frostfire mages are enormously RNG at the moment, but many players are okay with that. Incidentally, it is usually the Fury warriors I see accidentally pulling aggro. <br />
<br />
3) When comparing overall damage to survivability ratio between the three plate wearing classes (Paladin, Deathknight and Warrior) do you feel that things are balanced? <br />
I assume you mean dps specs, not tanks? I gather from your question that you think it isn't, so why don't you bring up the specific issue instead of tying to test me on whether I am aware of it?<br />
<br />
4) Are stance restrictions for certain abilities such as 1) Pummel 2) Rend 3) Overpower still considered a functional and desired warrior mechanic? Mostly in regards to Pummel as Arms is lacking a convinient interrupt due to it being balanced around battle stance. <br />
Yes, we like stance restrictions. That is really the major thing that makes stances unique. Despite the changes we made though, I still think Battle Stance is a little neglected and that is something we'll be looking at. <br />
<br />
5) Is weapon swapping invoking the GCD while in combat something that is considered to be ok, namely for a class like warriors which rely on frequently switching between a 2 hander and sword and board to use basic functions such as spell reflect, shield wall, and possibly shield bash? This could also help with the issue of Arms not having a readily accessible interrupt if equiping a shield didnt invoke the gcd to interrupt. <br />
It's supposed to be a decision on whether to use a shield or not, not something you can macro around. If we wanted you to use spell reflect without a sheild, we would have just done that. (Trivia: we did consider a deep Arms talent to let warriors spell reflect and possibly even bash with a two-hander.) <br />
<br />
6) Is changing charge to a 1 second root mechanic, similar to druids feral bear charge being considered, to help alleviate some of the issues warriors are facing in terms of not landing near their opponent, the stun not landing and lastly by invoking an early DR on stuns?<br />
You're talking about changing the mechanic just as a work around to technical limitations. That is a last resort if we can't make the tech work the way we want. The movement code in WoW is something we need to update. We are using it a lot more (consider even things like Disengage and Death Grip) than the original architects probably intended. If we can't make it work, then we might change charge. If we do DR on stuns, it won't be because of warriors.<br />
<br />
7) When comparing the damage sacrifice warriros take by equiping their shield and going into defensive stance to up their survivability to a druid going to bear form or a deathknight going into frost presence (which is further being buffed) are things considered balanced? <br />
Yes. To really benefit from bear form, a druid has to have certain talents. If they have those talents, they probably do not have as many +dps talents. A death knight, like a warrior, gives up a lot of damage by going into Frost Presence. The buff was made because we nerfed abilities like Icebound Fortitude and Bone Shield. You also don't have to use a shield and Defensive Stance together every time. It depends on what you are trying to accomplish.<br />
<br />
Now, I'll assume you are wearing plate. I am less sympathetic when warriors wear leather &quot;because it's better for us&quot; and then complain about survivability. <br />
<br />
8 ) With a resource like rage which can be plentiful or crippling scarce, is the 30 rage transfer between stances (if speced) considered to be a reasonable ammount or are there any considerations of possibly slightly increasing the amount retained through stances? <br />
This is something we might end up changing. Losing access to certain abilities might be enough. But again, the druid and death knight both pay a resource cost for changing. Remember it is supposed to be a decision, not a test of your reflexes to see how fast you can switch. <br />
<br />
9) &gt;&gt;Open ended question&lt;&lt; Ultimately I made this last one for you to write anything you think the warrior or general wow community would be interested in.<br />
I'll just throw out a couple of thoughts on warriors, since I haven't done it in awhile.<br />
<br />
Protection - very happy with the tree overall. One of our best success stories in LK I think. Still a viable tank, but with some more interesting abilities and actually a better PvP presence. Critical Block and Damage Shield may present scaling problems down the road.<br />
Fury - Titan's Grip is cool overall, though we still worry about whether Fury has enough buttons to push and too much rage. Whirlwind Glyph change should be nice. Might generate too much threat (with no viable dump) when blowing cooldowns.<br />
Arms - probably the tree that still needs the most love. Some of the new talents are very cool, but mid-tree may be a bit lackluster (we don't want to make the upper tree any more attractive to Fury). Deep Wounds is probably too high a percent of overall damage, but we don't want to nerf it without compensation elsewhere. Sudden Death may be too RNG, but we'll see. Bladestorm + Retaliation can make a nice tank.<br />
<br />

I would get pretty pissed if I missed a target in melee range with a giant axe as well, yet you generate no rage and actually lose rage if its a special ability. Logic has no place in a game of mechanics.</div></div><hr />

If you channel you anger/rage into an abiltiy and you miss ofc you would lose some of it. <br />

Lets say your smashing up a wooden fence which your going to put on a bonfire. Now your no angry at it but you are swinging for it. If you miss it once you loose all that energy you put into swing.<br />
I am no Lumberjack but just a experiance I think a large part of this community can relate too.<br />
<br />
Same Princable, you put the Energy (rage) into a swing and if it is missed/deflected then naturally you loose that Energy because the abilty was used but also you dont get the statifaction from smashing an object and you dont gain that extra energy/rage to do it again as quickly.<br />
<br />
Hope it makes sense..</div></div><hr />

You have to realize that Blizzard is it's own worst critic. From our point of view, we can always improve every aspect of the game. When we talk about bugs or things we still want to work on, that doesn't mean we shipped the game before we were ready. It means that we hold ourselves to a very high standard, honestly a lot higher than most of the players do. If there is something that annoys you about the game, it almost certainly drives us nuts.<br />

I thought engineering was the rogue of professions. It has something kinda cool that nobody really asked for and sucks compared to every other prof.

The haste enchant I think will only be on par with most glove enchants when it gets 2 more seconds added.<br />

JC and Alchemy are rather OP I find. Alchemist get pots in arena and an increased benefit from elixirs in PvE. Some of the JC only gems are just disgusting. Plus you know everybody needs gems and pots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You cannot compare it to other classes because warrior is it's own class and lets especially not compare a fantasy video game to real life, that just side steps the real issue here completely. I especially liked the dodge on the question regarding warrior survivability... well I am hoping Arms will get some love when Duel-spec comes out, since I am loving Protection so far.</div></div><hr />

Since all warriors are mentally retarded (thus explaining their lack of affinity to the whole 'mana' system) the simplest things can keep them under control. <br />
Happy sounds.... like the sound of their axe bouncing off of a shield *(claaaaang*), soothes the warrior, reminding them of a simpler time, when their mothers used to jingle Titanium Skeleton Keys in front of them as babies. <br />

As for Blizzard's statements about how much they care. It just makes me laugh not 4-5 months ago we were playing iin a shit hole of balance where Resto Druids were dominating anyone and everyone for 3 SEASONS, and blue is going to talk like they care more than the players? This resto raiding lifebloom viability nonsense was the worst logic i've ever heard to excuse that, like completely breaking PvP was worth making a class more wanted as a raid healer. Dev's will never live the stupidity of that very long period of WoW down with me, no matter how much they pretend to care about balance. That was some of the worst gaming balance i've EVER played in.<br />

About 45 minutes ago, I would have said the same thing BBR said, however I decided to look into Aion at their website. And... O... M... F... G!!!<br />
<br />
I am sorry, but if they do it right and take their time and perfect the game the way it should be, WoW will soon have alot of competition with Aion. They graphics are amazing, the concept of the game is intriguing and new, everything about it is just astonishing. I can tell you right now I will definetly be picking it up on release day. Celestial War, Ranger Class(YAYAYA!), PvPvE, etc. The game looks amazing. And with it being by the people that made Lineage(Pretty Good MMO) and City of Heroes, I wouldn't expect anything less of NCSoft, however I think they learned their mistakes in Guild Wars with limiting their players too much and will rectify it in this new game they are working on. Aion is coming, and it will definetly make Blizzard work harder if they want to stay at the top. 8) Take a look before you bash it. http://www.aiononline.com/us<br />

BTW Doomhammer, AWESOME VIDEO! I envy your mage skills. Truely epic. I am just glad I don't have to face someone of your caliber in PvP since I am more of a PvE'er when it comes to any class besides my hunter/warlock. Anyways, mad props! ;D</div></div><hr />

1) Is generating no rage on shielded targets considered to be a balanced mechanic or are possible alternatives being considered?<br />
It's not something we think is broken. Rage is not an unalienable right. You get it when you hit things. When you hit a shielded target, you aren't hitting them.<br />
<br />
Uhmm..what? In order to get the shield off of them you have to do a certain amount of damage. That means that you are hitting them. Those answers to that interview were a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And everyone who doesnt agree with the fact that Aion has 100 times better grafics and gameplay than WoW is simply retarded .. as for WAR/Conan promising some things, their grafics were just the same shit as WoW. Where is content now? Yes, its all cleared 3 days after release, and all you get is a content patch with 1(!) instance with 4 more bosses end of January ... for the next 4+ months - so what is now the difference between WoW:WotLK and WAR/Conan? Both have no endgame content.<br />

<br />
The difference between WoW grinding and Korean grinding is extreme.<br />
<br />
<br />
For a significant part of my MMO career, I have played Korean MMOs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">infernalx</div><div class="date">2008-12-26, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And its comparable?<br />
<br />
Granted, its both technically grinding, but what Korean MMO I played, its extremely long, boring, tedious grinding at all time.<br />
<br />
<br />
And don't forget normal/hard mode. WoW is plain Very-Easy mode, everythings literrally handed to you</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cho</div><div class="date">2008-12-26, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And WoW is not even made for PvP :&gt; ... thats just Blizzard trying hard to push it to something like ***e-sports*** and destroying it with it. Hi arena 2v2, 3v3, 5v5 ... lol 'MMO'.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stupid11</div><div class="date">2008-12-26, 12:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you're grinding honor in WoW - not exp .. rofl.<br />
<br />
Dude, you never saw a high quality game, so stfu and keep getting everything in your lil asshole - thats what WoW is about. :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
lol. Like people have said, WoW grind of ANY kind isn't comparable to the grind of any of the HUNDREDS of Korean MMOs out there.<br />
<br />
Grinding Timbermaw rep from neutral to exalted might be close to.... about 2 levels close to the cap of a Korean MMO (as in any 2 of the last 15% of the levels or so). OH WAIT, blizzard is giving full rep for grey mobs in the patch, cutting the time required by about 80%.<br />
<br />
Lolgrind. You don't know what a grind is.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Uhhh. no.<br />
<br />
&quot;a Blue said that HaT was bugged&quot;....BUT THEY FAIL TO FIX IT....is that really so hard?<br />
FIX SHIT BEFORE BALANCING, FIX LAG FFS.<br />
<br />
There, more in your retard language.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yea I'd like to see you fix every bug in a software project as big as WoW the moment it becomes known.<br />
<br />
Sorry, that just doesn't happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Using wikipedia as argument is just ... retarded? :D<br />
<br />
13 millions on official servers (Korea, Japan, SEA, USA, Europe, Russia), 9 millions more on private servers ... latest report oct '08, look at their website :D <br />
<br />
And everyone who doesnt agree with the fact that Aion has 100 times better grafics and gameplay than WoW is simply retarded .. as for WAR/Conan promising some things, their grafics were just the same shit as WoW. Where is content now? Yes, its all cleared 3 days after release, and all you get is a content patch with 1(!) instance with 4 more bosses end of January ... for the next 4+ months - so what is now the difference between WoW:WotLK and WAR/Conan? Both have no endgame content.<br />
<br />
FarCry engine ftw :&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
If you cbf to scroll down on the wikipedia site and click whatever press release they pulled that number from, then I cbf to do so either. It's called sources, use em.<br />
<br />
And pull numbers out of your ass more plz? I see absolutely ZERO support for those ridiculous numbers.<br />
<br />
Oh, and BTW 8 million people subscribed to WoW today, they all bought the battlechest AND Wrath, so WoW now has 19 million subscribers, look at their website :D<br />
<br />
LOL Conan's graphics were the same as WoW's? And Aion's are better than both? Are you fucking blind?<br />
<br />
I assume so, since you can't see this:<br />
Aion gameplay:<br />

<br />
SRO gameplay:<br />

<br />
AoC gameplay:<br />

<br />
WoW gameplay:<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv0sMyXxpco<br />
<br />
What's the big fucking difference? Oh yea, nothing. Aion looks a LOT more like SRO than AoC looks like WoW. (P.S. did YOU clear it in 3 days? Oh yea that's right you haven't even cleared Naxx. Looks like you still have plenty of content. Fail more.)</div></div><hr />

You fucking idiot prolly like that if you get something easy uppon your ass. But some people enjoy it, when they have to spent actually time in something to be perfect - which not everyone can accomplish so easily.<br />
<br />
I've played Lineage till lvl 80 - then I started to make cash out of it.<br />
<br />
Comparing grafics based on youtube videos is just as retarded as coming up with wikipedia posts. Aion is like 10 years away from WoW and any other MMO when it comes to grafics .. you didnt even played Beta - so stfu already.</div></div><hr />

The sad part is.. Its takes a bugged talent to put Rogues where they should be on DPS charts.<br />
Dont get me wrong, im all for other classes doing DPS. However, when the only thing your bring to a raid is raw DPS, you should be at the top of the meters. And please dont play the Tricks/FoK card. Tricks and FoK are retarded, rogues wont get raid spots because of these..</div></div><hr />

Sorry guys, but I had to make this account due this post being full of bulls**t.<br />
<br />
Aion being 10y away from any MMOs graphs? You haven't played AoC. AoC has the best grafs when it comes to MMOs, 10x better than Aion. AoC was pretty fun game actually, lots of new ideas etc but it failed because PR or so pissed on our eye.<br />
<br />
When that crap comes out (Aion) come to me in 6months after the release and tell me how much it failed. :)<br />
<br />
Have to say that WoWs graphs suck ass, but it's kind of what the warcraft is all about. It's simple and easy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palladiamors</div><div class="date">2008-12-27, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll say the same thing here I said on Vimeo: The music fits the scene PERFECTLY, except for the few moments it plays before the guards find the rogue. It feels a little akward in those moments, but the rest of the video it is spot on. Those who have a complaint with it DON'T LIKE THE SONG, and that is a personal preference, NOT constructive criticism. This video was amazingly well done, and I agree one hundred percent with the poster who stated that this fellow does more with Blizzards tools then Blizzard does. Bravo.</div></div><hr />
