<br />
New Transmogrification Collections System: Appearances<br />
<br />
<br />
New Collection tab: Appearances<br />
Unlock new appearances by collecting Soulbound weapons and armor your character can equip.<br />
Unlocked appearances are account-wide and usable for transmogrification by other characters that can equip the item.<br />
When first logging into a character after Patch 7.0, the appearances of appropriate items in your bags, bank, and Void Storage are learned automatically. Additional appearances will be unlocked based on previously-completed quests.<br />
Transmogrifiers located in most major cities have been improved with additional features.<br />
<br />
Got a look that you like? Save the entire transmogrification set as an outfit. Create and swap between outfits at the Transmogrifier.<br />
Additionally, transmogrifications can now be associated with your current specialization. Your outfit automatically changes when switching specializations if you so desire.<br />
Added a new option to hide shoulders.<br />
The option to hide helmets, cloaks, and shoulders has been moved into the transmogrification system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Revamped PvP Progression and Honor System<br />
<br />
<br />
The PvP Reward System will now provide appropriate items for players level 100 and below.<br />
Honor Points and Conquest Points have been removed as a currency.<br />
Items that were purchased using Honor or Conquest are now available for purchase with Marks of Honor that can be earned from Battlegrounds, Arenas, and Skirmishes.<br />
Learn more about upcoming PvP changes in our Legion PvP Preview (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/19994381/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Equalized PvP Gear<br />
<br />
<br />
Gear has been normalized in PvP combat. Characters entering a Skirmish Arena, Battleground, Rated Arena, Rated Battleground, or Ashran now receive an aura called Principles of War (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/228696-principles-of-war).<br />
Principles of War (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/228696-principles-of-war) removes all stats gained from gear (Strength, Stamina, Haste, etc.), disables gear related bonuses (like trinket effects and set bonuses), and gives the character stats based on their specializations, and increases based on overall item level. The goal is to provide a much more finely tuned and balanced PvP experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arenas<br />
<br />
<br />
The pennant attached to the back of characters now changes its appearance based on the player’s best rating in the Arena bracket.<br />
The 5v5 Arena bracket has been retired. &quot;Arena Master&quot; (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/1174-the-arena-master) achievement has been converted into a Feat of Strength.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
<br />
Winning a Battleground with characters below level 110 now awards a Crate of Battlefield Goods (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/135546-fel-touched-crate-of-battlefield-goods). Players on the opposing team also have a chance to receive a crate with an increasing chance based on team score at the end of a match. The crate contains a piece of armor appropriate for the character’s level and specialization with a chance for the crate to contain additional rewards such as weapons or relics.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
<br />
Hellfire Citadel<br />
<br />
<br />
Enemies on Normal, Heroic, and Mythic difficulty now deal roughly 30% less damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Legacy<br />
<br />
<br />
Normalized gold from Legacy raids prior to Warlords of Draenor. Heroic difficulty Cataclysm Raids now award less gold than before, while raids from Mists of Pandaria and Wrath of the Lich King will now award more gold.<br />
Ruins of Ahn’Qiraj now resets daily instead of every 3 days.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests and World<br />
<br />
Legendary Ring Quest Line<br />
<br />
<br />
Players can no longer start the quest line for the legendary ring. Players currently on the legendary quest line have until the launch of Legion to complete it; at which point uncompleted quests will be removed from the quest log.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tap Changes<br />
<br />
<br />
All creatures and NPCs can now be tapped by up to 5 other characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
World Events<br />
<br />
<br />
The Brawler's Guild is taking a break and will return at a later date.<br />
The Stranglethorn Fishing Extravaganza has taken a temporary hiatus while the fish are restocked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items and Itemization<br />
<br />
Itemization<br />
<br />
<br />
In an effort to reduce the amount of gear swapping between specializations, the following changes have been made.<br />
<br />
Legion cloaks, rings, and items worn on the neck are no longer tied to a specific primary stat, and will remain relevant between specializations.<br />
Spirit and Bonus Armor have been removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Multistrike has been removed. Items that had multistrike have had it replaced with another secondary stat.<br />
Trinkets obtained from Raids, PvP, and world drops in Warlords were overtuned and have been brought back to intended power levels.<br />
Set bonuses for item sets from expansions prior to Warlords of Draenor have been deactivated, though the text describing their former function still remains.<br />
Spell Power on all caster weapons have been consolidated into Intellect to make it easier to compare item power between two caster weapons. Overall weapon power remains unchanged.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
<br />
Equipment limits on the amount of crafted gear that can be worn have been removed.<br />
Potion of Luck (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/93351-potion-of-luck) and Greater Potion of Luck (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/76091-greater-potion-of-luck) no longer have an effect.<br />
Gladiator's Distinction (http://beta.wowdb.com/item-sets/1231-gladiators-distinction) set bonus has been removed from all PvP trinkets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character Changes<br />
<br />
Specialization System Changes<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters can now change between any of their specializations while out of combat. Action bar configurations and talent loadouts are saved for each specialization. As a result, Dual Specialization has been removed.<br />
Characters can queue up as any role that is available to their class and will automatically switch to the suitable specialization when entering the Dungeon, Raid, Battleground, or Arena without any gold cost. For example, a paladin might be questing as Retribution but queue up in Dungeon Finder as a Tank. When the paladin enters the dungeon, they will automatically switch to Protection.<br />
<br />
<br />
Updates to Combat Visuals and Audio<br />
<br />
<br />
Updated and improved on the animations, visual effects, and audio on core combat interactions like auto-attacks as well as many melee class abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talent System Changes<br />
<br />
<br />
Players may now change talents freely when in any rested XP area. The Inscription (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/professions/inscription) profession can craft consumable items that allow for this to be done in the field. In addition, after queuing into an instanced dungeon, raid, or PvP content, players have a grace period during which they may change talents freely.<br />
<br />
<br />
Glyph System Changes<br />
<br />
<br />
The Glyph panel has been removed from the game. Some minor glyphs that had a cosmetic effect that does not apply to a specific spell have been converted into cosmetic items that provide the same effects as before.<br />
Some minor glyphs that made cosmetic alterations to a specific spell have been added to the spell itself in the spellbook.<br />
<br />
<br />
Draenor Perks Removed<br />
<br />
<br />
Draenor Perks have been removed from the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Armor Changes<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunters and Shaman can now equip Mail armor from level 1 (down from level 40).<br />
Warriors and Paladins can now equip Plate armor from level 1 (down from level 40).<br />
New Mail and Plate reward options have been added to low level quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Racial Abilities<br />
<br />
Human<br />
<br />
<br />
Every Man for Himself (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/59752-every-man-for-himself) now removes all Stun effects and shares a 30-second cooldown with other items or abilities that have a similar effect.<br />
The Human Spirit (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/20598-the-human-spirit) has been redesigned. Human characters now gain 1% more of all secondary stats (Haste, Critical Strike, Mastery, and Versatility) from all sources<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrison<br />
<br />
<br />
Many sources of gold from the Garrison has been reduced or removed.<br />
Newly obtained salvage from the Salvage Yard no longer contains equippable items. Salvage obtained from before the patch remains unaffected.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Collections<br />
<br />
Toy Box<br />
<br />
<br />
A number of items with novel effects have been converted for inclusion in the Toy Box.<br />
Orb of Deception (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/1973-orb-of-deception) now lets the character retain features like armor that’s worn when transforming.<br />
New toy: Soft Foam Sword (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/137663-soft-foam-sword), sold by Jepetto Joybuzz (http://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/29478-jepetto-joybuzz). The toy mortally wounds (but does not kill) an enemy of trivial difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Inscription<br />
<br />
<br />
Major glyphs, along with many minor glyphs, have been converted or removed from the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UI<br />
<br />
<br />
Character nameplates have been reworked and have been upgraded to show class resources. Players may select a larger version of these nameplates from within the Interface Options menu.<br />
Enemy nameplates now provide additional information on status effects.<br />
Added class resource bars that display directly underneath your character.<br />
The character sheet has been trimmed down, though fully verbose stats are still available via the API.<br />
Interface options have changed and been further streamlined.<br />
Tab targeting logic has been reworked, and should now behave in a more consistent and predictable manner.<br />
A buff icon has been added to make it easier to tell when a character has XP gain disabled.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Account<br />
<br />
<br />
The maximum amount of gold that can be held at once has been increased to 9,999,999 gold. Guild bank maximum has also been increased to 9,999,999 gold.<br />
Maximum number of characters on a realm has increased to 12.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Graphics Engine<br />
<br />
<br />
Maximum draw distance has been extended greatly for all world content.<br />
5 additional levels of graphics presets have been added with 3 above the previous ‘Ultra’ setting.<br />
More advanced rendering techniques for fog have been added.<br />
Modern techniques for rendering color and other post-effects have been added.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to this list (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_7.0.3_(undocumented_changes)#Dungeons_and_Raids) the vendor value for items was nerfed across the board. Easy to verify, just check an item from the raid on the live and beta site and compare the vendor prices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Knowing Blizzard it'll be a straight 50% nerf to Cataclysm raids and as for the buffs odds are all they'll do is increase gold from 25g to 30g from MoP raids and think they've done us a favour, farming old raids was my main source of income, I don't want to buy WoW tokens or play the auction house so this nerf is a blow to me.

<br />
I think he's saying that you don't &quot;specialize&quot; in anything anymore. They're not specializations, they're more like stances, now that you can freely flip between any of them.<br />
<br />
Like, I used to think of my Priest as a Discipline Priest. That's what he specialized in. Then Dual-Spec was added, and I thought of him as a Discipline Priest who was also a Shadow Priest when soloing. Now.. he's really just a Priest. I might mostly group as Discipline and solo as Shadow, but I can switch to Holy &quot;stance&quot; if I want to.</div></div><hr />

they always do thing like that to prevent player stocking something before expansion and profiting from it, in this case, you will not be able to make a fortune selling all the item from salvage to the auction house ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
well they said that mop raid will have an increase in gold, no nerf there.. and i think that MoP25man raid-solo farming will be the new cataclysm25hm gold farming<br />
<br />
and 25g by boss is in normal mode, if they do like they did for cataclysm, that will certainly be 125g by boss in 25hm + a shitload of item to sold, i imagine that will be like cataclysm , arund 1600-2200 gold by MoP raid in 25hm</div></div><hr />

They've nerfed the vendor price of MoP items as well, no one seems to know how they've buffed the gold from MoP raids yet, it used to be 25g a boss I doubt it's anything higher than 50g knowing Blizzard, MoP raids won't be as lucrative as cata raids were.<br />
<br />
Especially given how some MoP raids have brick wall mechanics like Amber Shaper you'll need crazy ass burst to kill him and his add before he changes you into a monstrosity and instantly kills you.</div></div><hr />

I know it's not a lot of data, but hopefully this gives an idea. I also included item drops and how much they vendor for. To be honest overall it doesn't look like it'll be much of a drop. Still some, but not as bad as I've been reading.<br />

<br />
I put up a trading post for the first time today to sell bloods and resources for the little sacks of gold--I didn't open my salvage crates for the follower upgrades just since I didn't care tho, I&quot;m more interested in leisurely going through them for transmog gear in the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
I also replaced my Dwarven Bunker with a stables; something I wanted to do since the beginning since I'm a mount collector ^.^ feels good. I almost dare think that people may actually enjoy their garrisons more that they aren't a job unto themselves (though the gold was nice!).<br />

Oh and I thought you'd enjoy this pic--Since its WoD, the sky already fell a long time ago, but the good news is people seem pretty chill at the scene.<br />

Unfortunately I believe it won't work at all. Once again Blizzard are shitting on twinks and having fun in TW. I hope they eventually change their minds and make it work for a few levels beyond the intended level. That would be a compromise I would be okay with.</div></div><hr />

Yep, a friend of mine and I had the plan to do some Ashran (yes we know), some Battlegrounds etc to get Marks for undergeared alts to run some old Raids/Dungeons. It's mainly to get them a little bit of gear for the Invasion events (which also drop 700ilvl loot but to a less degree) to not get 1 shot.<br />
Not a lot of people have been talking about the BoA Tokens at all, but I'm certain more and more people will pick them up for the old PvP sets or to fill in some Gearslots.</div></div><hr />

well some classes have so many changes that you are basically asking for summary of all skills and their describtions...which is in the game so why dont you look at it? :O<br />
<br />
Even in case of a class/role that doesnt have many changes, like resto druid, what does it tell you when lifebloom heals 15% more? Pretty much nothing when everything else is changing.</div></div><hr />

They've always done patch notes like that in the past. And yes, I want to see how every ability is changing. Why do you think that's too much to ask for when they've always given that information in the past?<br />
<br />
Oh and also, some abilities don't even exist anymore. You don't care that they're not even making note of that in the notes? None of that shit is in the game, so Idk what the fuck you are even talking about.</div></div><hr />

they always do thing like that to prevent player stocking something before expansion and profiting from it, in this case, you will not be able to make a fortune selling all the item from salvage to the auction house ^^<br />
<br />
Makes sense, but I am more concerned about the BoE rare equipment you can get from the level 2 and up salvage yard. Is that removed too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually yes and no. Everyone still has their normal single res as before. The exception is healers also have access to a &quot;mass res&quot;. So no, not all resurrections are mass resses.<br />

<br />
It's a perk true, but they want to move towards more lore wise stuff. So having mages, rogues, etc being able to res when they normally wouldn't is a bit out of that league. I agree the convenience was nice, but didn't make sense at all.</div></div><hr />

The prepatch doesn't contain the invasion. That's what he's referring to. The invasion is an &quot;event&quot; that occurs in the patch before the expansion. It's easy to assume that the invasion was going to happen with this patch. But now as we see in the blue post they are splitting things up.<br />
<br />
Curious though; What other expansion did it in this manner?</div></div><hr />

Yes and no. The prepatch has the invasion event. The thing is they are gating the content through the entire patch. So it's not all at once and we are done. They've done similar process in past patches too. The MoP one had one I believe, think WoD added stuff each week for a few weeks, Vanilla to TBC did and TBC to Wrath I don't think did since they just used the Naxx event all over again minus zombification =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok that's what I thought was going to happen but wasn't sure. Gating it makes much more sense (the zombie invasion was a friggin blast). I must have misunderstood the blue post. In my head I understood it to say the event would happen at the time of the release. Also being on ptr I saw the invasion so I kinda auto assumed. <br />
<br />
This is going to be a fun expansion in my opinion. Been on beta this past week and I'm enjoying the zones a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I think there were a couple different blue posts explaining it, some confusing, some more clear. Gating it does make a lot of sense because it's better to look forward to stuff than be done Day 1. I think the Broken Shore is the last week or two prior to Legion as it transitions into it nice. So on Legion launch night you port to new Dalaran and get artifact quest.<br />
<br />
Hoping though Invasions start soon so we have more time to farm up the stuff for the limited mog gear.<br />
<br />
Also, yes the Zombie invasion was pretty fun until they nerfed the fun factor of zombying (dunno, made a new word lol) everyone. Still have a set or two from the event.</div></div><hr />

And yes, I want to see how every ability is changing. Why do you think that's too much to ask for when they've always given that information in the past?<br />
<br />
Oh and also, some abilities don't even exist anymore. You don't care that they're not even making note of that in the notes? None of that shit is in the game, so Idk what the fuck you are even talking about.<br />
<br />
wait, what? A removed ability is not in the game? WoW...because you cant see that its not there or what? I dont see any point in assigning some people for few days to summarize these changes when there are more modern means, like new tutorial thingie AND when these changes are not final. They will release new builds until the final release of Legion. (you have this, its the same as it used to be http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/20151961/legion-pre-expansion-patch-notes-7-18-2016 except they went with more describtive way rathen than a numerical one).<br />
<br />
Last official wow video hints they may go with LoL-style of videos in the future, briefly describing changes to specs etc (basically what youtubers do). But there will always be people demanding huge wall of text describing every single effect of artifact weapon (we have what, 40 of them or something) when they can just open up artifact calculator and look at it. Same goes with talents and spells.</div></div><hr />

The racial you're thinking of Diplomacy. The Human Spirit is the racial that gave them 100 versatility so this is actually a much better change for their racial.<br />

<br />
Well I know I tend to prefer reading up on changes rather than watching videos on them because I rarely have time to sit down for videos but I do spend a lot of time where I can sit and read up on things in between doing stuff. And it would certainly be helpful for those who might struggle with the videos due to hearing disabilities for example.</div></div><hr />

I believe that is a typo. There is no limit on the amount of crafted gear you can equip in Legion. But, unless I missed something they didn't change anything on WoD crafted limit.</div></div><hr />
