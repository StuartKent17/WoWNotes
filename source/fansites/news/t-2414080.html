If you didn't appreciate the journey of that short and the significance behind it then you're not really that interested in the story tbh. Also Blizz told us when they announced this that it was just exploring some character personality, no &quot;new story developments&quot; if that's what you're expecting.</div></div><hr />

That's how i felt too. Like she knows how bad the things she did were because of hindsight and now she's owning up to the notion that everyone thinks she's a monster. #VoidlordJaina</div></div><hr />

Syvanas brings war in BfA, obviously. Azshara is also a bringer of war, as she always is. <br />

its suppose to empathize confusion and hesitation.<br />
but understandable, but it is there for a reason, most likely wont be for others, if we do it may be lamnent of the highborne for sylvanas or something.<br />

Because that book was made by an Author. This video was made by the same team who made the Warlords and Legion Animated shorts.<br />

Expect nothing else but the best from them everytime imo.<br />

Kul'Tiras is a cool sea shaman pirate military all in a blender country.<br />
<br />
&quot;SEA SHANTIES ARE DISNEY HURR&quot;<br />
<br />
Note this isn't an argument against you, just supporting you. The song and video hit kind of perfectly with showing Jaina's hardened character and her return to Kul'Tiras, her homeland, after betraying her father and now her people even have a song about how horrible she is.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure he understands the difference, he's saying he wishes Blizz chose the style they used in Warbringers rather than make it a comic. No need to be rude for no reason other than to be rude.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Beware, beware the Daughter of the Seas.&quot; <br />
&quot;Beware,&quot; I heard him cry.<br />
His words carried upon the ocean breeze, As he sank beneath the tide. <br />
Those blood-soaked shores of Kalimdor, Where sailors fought and died. <br />
The admiral fell at Theramore, because she left his side.<br />
<br />
Why this? Why this oh Daughter of the Seas?<br />
Why this? Did you forget your seaside days? <br />
Always the pride of our nation's eyes, How could she go astray? <br />
When she did flee across the ocean deep, the admiral followed west. <br />
What else but sail to save a daughter's life, and pray she still drew breath? <br />
But there he found on the distant shores, Enemies 'on the rise! <br />
<br />
But when he faced those savage foes, His daughter stood aside.<br />
Buried deep beneath the waves, Betrayed by family.<br />
To his nation, with his last breath, cried, &quot;Beware the Daughter of the Seas.&quot;﻿</div></div><hr />

It’s Jaina’s backstory and the founding of Kul Tiras versus her in Theramore. <br />
<br />
Admiral Proudmoore (her father) was a veteran of the First and Second Wars that hated the Orcs. He went to battle at see against their armada, and asked Jaina to join him. She stayed in Theramore seeking peace. His ship and crew were lost, and the people of Kul Tiras blamed Jaina for betraying them and siding with the Horde. <br />

<br />
She couldn't have been at Theramore during First and Second war cuz Kalimdor was &quot;discovered&quot; by alliance during events in Warcraft III and Theramore didn't even existed back then. She settled in Kalimdor and raised Theramore city AFTER Archimonde was killed at Mount Hyjal. <br />
<br />
Then her father was killed in the orc campaign in Frozen Throne (warcraft III expansion). And that was LONG after first and second war.<br />
<br />
So Your story doesn't really &quot;add up&quot; . Did Blizzard change it at some point and deemed Warcraft III lore redundant or... ?</div></div><hr />

Actually, she did more than let his ship be lost, she let them into theramore where he was at the time and watched them kill her father.</div></div><hr />

Small correction - she did not stay in Theramore seeking peace. Daelin actually took over Theramore from her. Jaina then aided Thrall's forces in assaulting the island by helping circumvent the naval blockade. She only stood aside when the Horde forces stormed the citadel, only coming in after her father was already dead.</div></div><hr />

While I am somewhat fond of Rexxar from when I preferred Horde, before it went down a path I couldn't support with Garrosh and now Sylvanas, I have to admit I would be satisfied to see a bloody fight between Jaina and Rexxar where she slays him.<br />
<br />
Would finally add the sense of danger and menace to the Alliance side it's always been lacking. Would give the Horde a valid reason to want to fight seeing their champion die, rather than just &quot;hurr durr let's go murder us some more civilians boys!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jaina is a powerful mage, supposed-to-be girlfriend of the late Arthas Menethil, the former Lich King. She was also the ruler of Theramore. She is also a member of The Six, the group of Kirin Tor mages that rule Dalaran.<br />
Back in Warcraft 3, she sided with the horde to stop the legion. Her father, Admiral Proudmoore, leader of Alliance's naval forces, tried to &quot;rescue&quot;her and got killed by Rexxar. Besides that, she was still friendly with horde leaders. <br />
That changed once Garrosh took over as warchief, and -literally- nuked Theramore. He flipped her switch and began to trully hate horde and work towards their demise. Her hatred became so deep that she refused to stay in Dalaran, once it was decided they would welcome the horde once again to battle the Legion.</div></div><hr />

Jaina is a powerful mage. Was an apprentice to Archmage Antonidas, who was also the leader of the Kirin Tor. He was killed by Arthas, and Arthas took some old spellbooks that had belonged to Medivh.<br />
<br />
Jaina has been a huge peace advocate throughout the years. She was summoned by Medivh to meet with Thrall to build communication between the factions. Tried to build better alliances/relationships between the alliance and horde. She continually tried to &quot;save&quot; the Lich King (well, Arthas inside), but was ultimately unable to. She become the leader of the Kirin Tor, and continued to push for peace.<br />
<br />
...until Garrosh effectively dropped a nuke on Theramore. After that point -- she has been completely and utterly anti-horde. She even left the Kirin Tor during Legion because she refused to work with the horde on any level, for any cause.<br />
<br />
As for the video short - Kul Tiras is her homeland. She left, and her father went after her. Effectively, he died to Orcs. Orcs who she had ultimately been trying to side with. Her homeland hates her -- because they most likely believe she was the cause of her father's death, and that she betrayed her own for the Orcs.<br />
<br />
She is now returning home to Kul Tiras, on her father's ship (that had been sunk). She is returning with the same hatred that her father had for the Orcs. She wants blood, and they want blood (after she apologizes, and convinces them she's on their side). She is arguably one of the most powerful mages on Azeroth, if not the most powerful currently. She is a force to be reckoned with in her own right.</div></div><hr />

Who is Jaina? What happened at Theramore? Why should we care? And how does all of this relate to BofA?<br />
<br />
she's important because she is the daughter of daelin proudmoore, the former lord admiral of the island nation of kul tiras, which we will get to visit in BfA.<br />
during WC3 she allowed the horde to kill her father as she back then strived for peace while her father hated the orcs and wanted them dead.<br />
hence why she is so hated by kul tiras, and hence the song.<br />
<br />
&quot;beware the daughter of the sea&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
theramore was basically the place where her father died, she built her city on it and it was destroyed during cataclysm times by the horde under the order of garrosh hellscream.<br />
that drove her nuts and now she blames the entire horde for it and wants war.<br />
<br />
<br />
there is a lot more than that, i advise reading her wowpedia page.<br />

Was a ghost version of Jaina's father rowing the boat? What was her location and why all the broken ships? How did she just raise a giant ship? I like when these clips are more story driven but this one just confused me. Kinda makes up with the music though.<br />
<br />
The whole thing is about regret. The ghost version of her father wasn't actually there, the bodies and broken ships weren't actually there, they are all just a representation of Jaina's decision to side with the horde against her father. She's reliving events that took place here. The song sung by the Kul'tirans reinforcing the fact that she turned her back on her people and they hate her for it. <br />
<br />
Her decision is clearly haunting her, right up until the moment she accepts her past, and accepts that maybe her father was right(raising the ship), thus the ghosts of her past finally disappearing.<br />
<br />
As for raising the ship, she's a master class wizard with command of ice/water. Not too hard of a reach to think she's capable of this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Jaina helped the Horde gain ships from the goblins and ordered her own troops to stand down when they assaulted Theramore. Jaina's last words to her father were to ask why he didn't listen.<br />
<br />
When the people of Kul Tiras learned of their Lord Admiral's death, they cried out for vengeance, but the other nations of the Alliance were not interested. Ordeals caused by the plague in Lordaeron were more immediate concerns, and the other allied leaders also had little pity for Daelin's own aggressive actions. The people of Kul Tiras furiously isolated themselves from the rest of the Alliance, but were not angry with all of the Alliance leaders. They instead nursed a bitter hatred only towards Jaina for betraying her family.<br />
<br />
Not saying sylvanas isn't, but Jaina is far from innocent.</div></div><hr />

She doesn't need to be possessed by a dreadlord or corrupted by the void. She needs to just become a cold, calculating, brutal leader of the alliance war effort. Not a villain in the way that most villains are written in Warcraft, but someone who's give a damn is busted.</div></div><hr />

Yes. There would be one Garrosh instead of two Garroshes. And Garrosh is not the only one who fought against the Alliance. Since OG Alliance VS Horde was a thing, people were dying because of her.</div></div><hr />

I think that's exactly what they're trying to convey. On the surface level it plays like a sort of revenge / returning home / power fantasy deal. But if you know the true story, it's a tragic tale about someone who did the noble thing, but paid a price for it, started second guessing her decision, and has now started down a dark path.<br />
<br />
Hopefully Blizzard can follow through with that story on the deeper level and not just get lost in the shallows.</div></div><hr />

She doesn't need to be possessed by a dreadlord or corrupted by the void. She needs to just become a cold, calculating, brutal leader of the alliance war effort. Not a villain in the way that most villains are written in Warcraft, but someone who's give a damn is busted.<br />
<br />
Yes horde aggression.<br />
<br />
Like Theramore building a highway from thier town to the front lines.<br />
<br />
Front lines that Jaina instigated before Deathwing awoke with her aggression towards the Barrens and Durotar. Both of which were before Garrosh going into Ashenvale (Cataclysm quests horde side in Southern Barrens). If Jaina was peaceful and Neutral she would have told varian to fuck off time and again.

Yes. That’s exactly what they said. Which we’ll have to see what her short is like, and what the 8.2 adds. But regardless, it’s Azshara rather than Jaina as that raid boss.</div></div><hr />

Except when Chronicles 3 confirms that Garrosh invaded Ashenvale first. Theramore invaded the Barrens to prevent exactly what happens in BfA to relieve pressure on her Night Elven allies.</div></div><hr />

1. She just raised a ship from the depths, she could have actually done nothing. Maybe it was her father's spirit that actually raised it.<br />
2. Might just be visions, examples of the men who died because she stood aside. Her regrets<br />
3. It's clearly magical in nature. To be honest if I lived in this type of world and I need a ship. I'd want it made so the elements wouldn't rot it away, use magic infused wood? We know that's a thing. Especially on a flagship.</div></div><hr />

However, the audio mixing sounds like ass, lol. The song is good and fine but everything else, especially the very beginning, sounds downright amateur. Also, the lyrics to the song are a little clunky and could've been composed better. Very well performed, though.</div></div><hr />

Too bad it's being used in some sort of attempt at trying to undo the real Jaina. She hasn't been herself since W3.</div></div><hr />

Are characters not allowed to change or develop?</div></div><hr />

Daaaaaaaaaaaum Jaina, some brutal stuff inbound. Also amazing video and song... the chills!<br />
<br />
It was amazing.. i HOPE this means she's going to have an active role in BFA and not be as passive as she has been in the past pertaining to horde welfare. It always annoyed me just HOW passive she was.. i understood her desire but it always seemed to backfire and cost her/the alliance something and now... now maybe she's finally going to get some character development that doesn't assassinate her like they almost did in MoP.</div></div><hr />

Also Laura Bailey singing is a new crown gem for the franchise.</div></div><hr />

Having your home town blown off the face of the earth (among other slightly tetchy subjects) has a tendency to change a person.</div></div><hr />

Not when they pull a 180 on her entire character.<br />
<br />
Jaina was a character who was capable of looking beyond hatred and bigotry and actually getting to the bottom of things. That she is traumatized by Theramore is more than understandable. That she is unable to differentiate between Garrosh and the Horde is completely absurd, and inconsistent with everything she was as a character.<br />
<br />
And now she's having regrets about standing aside to put down a rabid dog of a man? She understood and agreed with why he had to die, at the time. She saw it as the right decision, to be made for the sake of peace. Now she's throwing that away to go begin her own unnecessary path of bloodshed—something she always hated when others did. Trauma is one thing, but there is no reconciling this Jaina with the Jaina of the past. They're two completely separate characters.</div></div><hr />
