<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
Pets will be account wide.<br />
The battle system will be accessible to all players from a low level.<br />
The battle system works with almost every pet.<br />
Rare pets will not give any combat advantage, but may give a cosmetic advantage.<br />
Your pet journal will display info on all your pets, including stats, skills, and also drop locations and lore info for the pets you don't have yet. It will also let you manage your teams and battle parts of the system.<br />
You will be able to customize your pet with names or visuals for the abilities. <br />
Every pet can use 3 abilities in a battle at one time with a total of 6 abilities to swap around between battles.<br />
Every time you level you will also increase the stats of your pet.<br />
The current pet level cap is 25.<br />
You will level multiple pets to build your team, which consists of 3 slots for pets during battle.<br />
<br />
<br />
Collecting<br />
<br />
Most pets will become tradable, even after being leveled.<br />
There will be Wild Pets that you can find in the world and engage in battle with. After defeating it, you will be able to get that pet and add it to your Pet Journal.<br />
Wild Pets have random stats, some of them will be very good at tanking, some will have a CC ability, and so on.<br />
Some pets will only be found during a specific season, while it's raining, or during the day or the night. For example, some of them will only spawn in the spring, when it's raining, in Elwynn Forest at night! <br />
There will be at least one unique pet per zone. <br />
<br />
<br />
Battle<br />
<br />
There will be both PvE battles against Wild Pets and PvP battles against other players.<br />
It will be a simple turn based combat system.<br />
You can fight with a team of 3 pets.<br />
There will be a queuing system so that you will be able to find a fight pretty fast depending on the level of your pets.<br />
Winning battles will earn experience and levels for your pets. <br />
<br />
<br />
Customization<br />
<br />
You will finally be able to name your pets, and see that name in battle.<br />
You can obtain items for your pets.<br />
You will have an item slot for your pet and might be able to socket gems in the item.<br />
There will be individual builds of abilities for each pet and different teams.<br />
There will be Pet Masters in the world who will let you earn Master abilities when you beat them. For example, beating the master of mechanical pets will get you a new ability for your pet.<br />
<br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Cross Realm Raids and a Lack of Community<br />
Unfortunately, that opinion is very subjective. The continued popularity of the cross-realm LFD tool, and now the LFR, indicates that a great number of players are just fine with using it for quicker access, rather than attempting to group up with people on the same realm.<br />
<br />
Also, implying that every group in LFD/LFR is filled with people you'd gladly never group up with again is exaggerating the actual situation. There are many of us who use the tools a lot, and rarely experience this.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, the future BattleTag system will go a long way to improving the ability to build and maintain cross-realm friendships, eliminating the need to fill groups with as many 'randoms'.<br />
<br />
[...] We're always looking for feedback and ways to improve our features. Player feedback regarding dungeon groups and long wait-times contributed to the development of the dungeon finder tool in the first place. Now, in response to new feedback, BattleTags will address some of the issues players currently face when meeting potential friends on different realms. <br />
<br />
No, unfortunately some people don't always enjoy the groups they find themselves in through the Dungeon Finder. But do you believe limiting the pool of players to your own realm, or offering an incentive to manually search for your own group will solve this?<br />
<br />
Finishing a dungeon with a great group before the Dungeon Finder tool was available was indeed a fantastic experience, but I personally still get that feeling now when I'm grouped with a nice bunch of people. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215707-community-not-in-wow/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3225584072?page=4#77))<br />
<br />
Extra Character Slots<br />
There are on-going discussions about how we want to handle this issue. If I recall correctly, there were some ideas brought up at BlizzCon about what we could potentially do to alleviate the concerns about extra character slots, but I don't have any more information on a specific decision right now.

I ran a poll that shows this is exactly what most people wanted. Not necessarily this exactly, but the winner of my &quot;what was the biggest flaw in Cata&quot; poll was &quot;Not enough to do at 85.&quot;<br />

This is more to do at 90.</div></div><hr />

sucks when you sign up for the annual contract but have no control over poorly developed or changed contact after you've signed it...at least on a month-to-month basis you can decide that things are going the wrong way<br />
<br />
basically Blizzard gave you the option for guarenteed beta access into MoP, a mount, and D3 free, but in trade, you're forced to be subjected to their doing things that might ruin the game? talk about incentive</div></div><hr />

That's his point. It isn't an inspired little mini-game, it's just a shameless rip-off to try and squeeze out more playtime; what's worse, people are applauding this.<br />

You will still have your raids so you can feel like a special snowflake. This is a SIMPLE thing to add since its such &quot;ripoff&quot;, so it isn't taking that much time to develop. Allot of people want this, and whether you want this or not is irrelevant. Stop being selfish.</div></div><hr />

Rift has public quests, If wow was adding public quests to the list f things then i could say the same thing you did. (If i want to play wow ill play wow. If i want to play rift ill play rift. See what i did there? This is a simple amazing thing they are adding to the game. I dont think blizzard should add new arenas to wow, but i don't go around bashing every time they do because im not selfish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the contrary, it being completely unoriginal and a shameless ripoff doesn't mean they don't have to take the time to give every single pet stats and moves, create the battle system, create this &quot;wild pet&quot; encounter shit, make the queue for it (because apparently we're too lazy to play Pokemon), make the ridiculous &quot;Minipet Master&quot; gym leaders, etc.<br />
<br />
And if you want this, get an emulator and play Pokemon on your computer. Every time a blatant ripoff of WoW is announced, the community (rightly) denounces it - but this is somehow okay?<br />

No, according to me I constantly see people bitching about how Blizzard needs to do this or that to serve the people who &quot;don't have time to play the game,&quot; then turn around and say that they don't have to cater to people who do &quot;have time&quot; to play the game.</div></div><hr />

Because this isn't an entire game based off of it.<br />
<br />
This is an OPTIONAL feature that they are adding in for people to have FUN with at all levels. It's freaking optional, don't do it if you don't like it. Why can't something fun be in the game, not 'hardcore' enough for you?</div></div><hr />

Why do you assume this is about this being 'hardcore'? Do you know what I've spent the last few days doing? Farming old instances for my transmog set. I have Loremaster, and questing is far from hardcore. Hell, if I had a copy of Pokemon Gold and a GBA right now, I'd probably be playing it.<br />

Like Wow isn't overun by PT12 already, we really need this ... <br />
If this is the answer to the growing number of ppl leaving for more mature games with better graphics and alternative content... I'm pretty sure SWOTR and consorts, are gonna be the grown up version of of what wow is becomming. <br />
<br />
Seriously, After 7 years there is still no decent balance, ppl are still complaining about revamped content, and the graphics engine is pretty much pong-material compaired to others currently used by upcoming competition. Isn't that more of a priority ?<br />
<br />
I realise that some ppl love panda's and pokemon, but there are also ppl that like shooters and racing games, neither have a place in a MMO that has a storyline like WoW tbh.</div></div><hr />

What's 'yawn' for you isn't 'yawn' for me. I'd be perfectly happy if they gave us more raids and dungeons - especially if they didn't mind making some of them longer or harder for those of us that like that. Beyond that, I'd like to see more active daily quest hubs and more world events ('m hoping they bother to make PVE scenarios actually interesting). I would also like to see some longer and more complicated BGs, such as the original Alterac Valley.<br />

<br />
And I won't. Thanks for the typical no-argument response, though.<br />
<br />
I'm just wondering why Blizzard is implementing pokeymans into WoW. Are they trying to attract more kids? If they're trying to add more non-raid/dungeon content, they're doing it wrong. Like others have said, if I wanted to play pokeymans, I'd play pokeymans, not a cheap ripoff of it within another game.<br />

Not to mention it just....doesn't fit. Pet battles? In WoW? Why? What's the lore behind making cute animals fight? It just doesn't mesh well with WoW universe. It's as if Nintendo put hidden minigames on computers in a Metroid Prime-esque game.</div></div><hr />

The hypocrisy of the WoW community is staggering. Would you mind explaining to me how it's only Blizzard's job to cater to their subscribers and make them happy if the subscribers in question are casuals or unskilled?<br />
<br />
Look on the bright side. Said &quot;unskilleds&quot; and &quot;casuals&quot; will be so busy engaged in the Pet Battle System that there will be that much less of them around to waste your time in an LFD or LFR. Raids and dungeons can finally get tuned to reasonable difficulties that will keep the content engaging without coming off as trivially easy or excrutiatingly difficult.</div></div><hr />

Go ahead, give me a reason.<br />
<br />
Your opinion doesn't matter anymore then mine. I never said that mine mattered, but the millions that do want this matter. Its something fun being added to the game and all you and people like you can do is complain about optional things. If you don't like it then don't use it. You said you like questing, but maybe i hate it. Im mad that Blizzard are adding 200 more quests the needed to ding 90, and that time could have been spent on more pets. Obviously i don't hate questing, but my example is just as ridiculous as your reason for not wanting this. Just let people have something that you don't like. Like i said, i don't care for arenas, but i dont go complaining when Blizzard adds them because i realize other people like them.</div></div><hr />

:P Hahaha<br />
<br />
I dunno about admitting they were wrong, but when it inevitably turns out to not be what they thought it was going to be, they'll be crying that it's broken and Blizzard needs to fix it.<br />
<br />
Personally, if I were still interested in playing WoW, I'd prefer that they pour those wasted resources into content everybody can enjoy, rather than a niche mini-game. Yeah, sure, playing it's optional, but the devotion of time and development resources isn't. Why couldn't we have more, better battlegrounds, or instances, or zones, or daily quests, etc? These things all have a much broader appeal than a mini-game that doesn't advance your character in the slightest, and will only take up more resources to maintain it in the future - at the cost of other content for all players. Yeah, that's just great. What I see is that most players either don't want it or don't care, only a small portion actually really want this feature. Over time, the number of players who don't want it &amp; the number that do want it will gradually dwindle into those who don't care and it will become a sad reminder of why you don't try to tell players what they like.</div></div><hr />

I would also like to see some longer and more complicated BGs, such as the original Alterac Valley.<br />
<br />
If things related to the actually game bore you, then you're the people that REALLY shouldn't be here. I believe 'casuals' and 'hardcores' and everything in between have a place here; people who play the game and think, &quot;This is boring! What's this RPG crap?

Thank you for proving my point. By you telling me &quot;this game just might not be for you&quot; literally solidifies my stance that this game could do with some diversity. Just because YOU like more raids and YOU like more dungeons doesn't mean that's what this game is needing. <br />
<br />
But, it is optional. So, enjoy watching people jump around stormwind. I'll be leveling my team and getting achievements with the new, completely optional feature. <br />

I'm just wondering why Blizzard is implementing pokeymans into WoW. Are they trying to attract more kids? If they're trying to add more non-raid/dungeon content, they're doing it wrong. Like others have said, if I wanted to play pokeymans, I'd play pokeymans, not a cheap ripoff of it within another game.<br />
<br />
Not to mention it just....doesn't fit. Pet battles? In WoW? Why? What's the lore behind making cute animals fight? It just doesn't mesh well with WoW universe. It's as if Nintendo put hidden minigames on computers in a Metroid Prime-esque game.<br />
<br />
<br />
His reply isn't a typical no argument, its a straight answer. Don't like it, don't use it. End of story. Not everything has to be lore related either, somethings CAN happen that *Gasp* just might be unrelated to all current events. Doesn't make it useless/unworthy/etc. Just because a game adds a facet some don't enjoy doesn't mean its the end of the world as we know it. <br />
<br />
I hate pvp, as long as its not forced down my throat by MAKING me do it to achieve goals in PVE, I don't care what they do with it. It might have 'lolore' with it, and it 'might' fit the game through story, but in practice it fails. I also fail to see how they are &quot;Doing it wrong&quot; since no one has even been able to test it out or see if it is in fact good or an utter failure.<br />
<br />
Declaring something horrible, a failure or being done incorrectly without even seeing in action is childish imo, that goes with most everything even outside of game as well.</div></div><hr />

What Lore is needed for something as simple as this, there doesn't need to be some epic history about the fact that some kids are outside in the backyard playing with their ant collection does it? Same issue here. something simple on the side, for others to do. If they are doing a fake pokemon thing to get more kids that might like it, let them, more money for them by ways of familiarity seems like a basic ploy that a lot of companies use. But like others have said, why do you care? If you don't do a think with it, it wont affect you at all, personally I don't like the whole PvP concept, but its in the game, and its huge, but since I don't dabble in it, it doesn't affect me one bit.</div></div><hr />

Completely agree. <br />

Adding 5 points would be allot easier then what they are doing with the new talents. The new talents will end up being easier to balance after every xpac and will make people have different talents. I think the talent system if done right will be the biggest innovation to mmo talents in years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no evidence to support that. <br />
<br />
There is, however, evidence that the talent systems don't work like they want them too. Blizz feels like instead of choice, you get cookie cutter. Cookie cutter is based on more throughput, so they're eliminating throughput stats in talents. However, this is t the topic at hand. <br />
<br />
You can find more info on the talent system on the official website. Please get educated before making unsupported claims as facts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Because he's not right in the head, dear.&quot;<br />
<br />
Things should make sense in the game world. A cute little popculture reference quest or a short minigame can serve as comic relief or a break in pace, but this is ridiculous.

Exactly. It's not like Blizzard doesn't have a huge shopping list of things to update, fix or revisit already. Pet battles was plucked right out of the aether. It's like spending all your money on a new paint job for your car when you need to replace the muffler.</div></div><hr />

A waste of time as in &quot;I'm not getting more wow content&quot; or a waste of time &quot;this isn't going to give anyone anything extra to do&quot;?<br />
<br />
Which is it? Are you aware that the team handling this isn't anyway in any fashion even able to be involved in raid or dungeon design?<br />
<br />
Greedy, greedy snowflakes. <br />
<br />
I think pvp is a waste of &quot;design time&quot; personally. I really do. Pve suffers dearly for it. Do I go around saying &quot;remove it! Stop focusing on it&quot;! Hell no! Know why? Cuz that's someone's FaVOTITE part of wow. And I wouldn't want to take that away from them, even if it means that I MIGHT get extra of something I already get. <br />
<br />
So, just sit back and hush up about them wasting time.</div></div><hr />

Things should make sense in the game world. A cute little popculture reference quest or a short minigame can serve as comic relief or a break in pace, but this is ridiculous. Not just from a lore perspective, but from a genre perspective. Do people go on a FPS and say, &quot;Hey, why isn't there more Tetris?&quot;<br />

A tetris/fps cross over could be amazing btw.</div></div><hr />

The answer is called &quot;selling out&quot; and it's typical of a company who only cares about money. This system will add the most money into the pockets of Blizzard/EA. Simple as that. That is the main reason it was selected above all other criteria.</div></div><hr />

An absurd straw-man. You basically said that he said something he didn't say.<br />
<br />
You think that pet battles WON'T be dull and repetitive? Especially after a week, or a month? You're trying to claim that this feature will be the exception, that it'll always be new and exciting, but it won't. Just like everything else new, some people will get caught up in the craze and play with it excessively for a few weeks. Then, they might use it once every few months. All that time and all those resources will go straight down the drain.<br />
<br />
People wouldn't quit if there were other NEW content. New zones. New battlegrounds. New instances. New raids. New daily quests &amp; hubs. With the development resources going into pet battles, they could make tons of new daily quests with more variety, to keep the game from getting stodgy and boring. I guarantee you that pet battles will gather cobwebs before they're a month old. By contrast, look at the longevity of the Argent Tournament/Dalaran Profession daily quests. Because you were offered some variety in which quest would be randomly selected each day, the content lasted longer. If they expanded on this concept and added an even broader pool of daily quests, patches &amp; expansions would almost definitely last longer. Firelands, which was so restricted in what it offered because you only experienced quests in small portions of two zones, helps to emphasise this point, but Blizzard still seems to have missed it.</div></div><hr />

I do get angry when someone tries to tell me that I'm a child for liking something. perhaps if your older and wiser, you should realize its time to put down computer games and move on to a more classic form of entertainment, like canasta. I hear that's still popular with old bitter people. <br />

I don't think a whole lot of people will be interested in it. They could spend this development time on other things, if you ask me. But I guess there is a market for this, else they probably wouldn't be making it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lobosan</div><div class="date">2012-01-12, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the reason so many people feel frustrated with the decision to ripoff pokemon is threefold. <br />
<br />
1) First and foremost, it DOES take resources away from developing other, much needed improvements to gameplay, as Blizzard has constantly stated that time and money for these things are limited and the allocation to one slot removes the possibility for another project. A cosmetic fix to old player character models, or the often-promised dance studio, would likely be a far more desirable feature for the majority of the WoW community. Spending the time and money to develop non-cosmetic improvements, such as gameplay balance, innovative skill mechanics, more challenging boss fights, and more immersive storylines that don't dead-end (looking at you, Throne of the Tides) would be almost universally applauded and undeniably superior to pokepets.<br />
<br />
2) It is a shamefully unprofessional thing for a company as powerful as Blizzard to resort to outright theft. This sort of thing is not only pandering to the pokemon fans and the gullible young, it's also smearing the name of a company which we, as players, are associated with, by promoting the blatant theft of another company's intellectual property. Stealing pokemon rather than coming up with original ideas is a pathetically high-school level of theft and plagiarism...and what's worse, Blizz didn't even make efforts to hide the fact that it was stolen, thereby demeaning not only their reputation, but the intellect of their player base. When a major corporation has to resort to this level of thievery, it pollutes the community which it created and indicates a serious problem with the company's ability to sustain a creative and professional environment.<br />
<br />
3) It is not in keeping with the spirit and atmosphere of the game. This one is for those individuals who want to FEEL like they are actively engaging with a living, breathing world, in this case, the World of Warcraft. Much like the immersiveness of Skyrim that has made it so popular, WoW must (and typically used to) endeavor to keep easter eggs in their place and ultimately preserve the feel of a singular world with identifiable rules and characters. When you throw something like Pokemon into the World of Warcraft, it breaks the suspension of disbelief and fantasy atmosphere which many players rely on to have a good time in the game. Even if they are not battling with these pets, they will be forced to encounter them, or others battling with them/talking about them, which can spoil an otherwise unique role-playing experience.<br />
<br />
I want to note that these are my opinions, NOT facts. But they are opinions which are shared by many, and I hope they will be considered with the same respect I would afford any fellow player. Thank you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lightfist</div><div class="date">2012-01-12, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is just ridiculous that you are even trying to argue lore on this.

<br />
I already commented on the pop culture references; I feel they're fine in small doses, but that they've been overdone. Similarly, I commented earlier that this would have been fine as a smaller mini-game - I even made it clear that I had kept my mouth shut up until this point hoping that's what it would be.<br />
<br />
I fail to see why Warlocks wondering towns with their pets is relevant, unless you want every NPC to gasp in horror after the 400th time of seeing an imp. Warlocks aren't new, and we already saw how people reacted to strange and new things with the Death Knight intro.<br />
<br />
All this being said, your argument is basically, &quot;There's already some shit that doesn't make sense, why not add more?&quot; Would that argument work anywhere else? &quot;Well, X was pretty shit! Why are you complaining about Y being shit?&quot;</div></div><hr />

How about the fact that warlocks roam towns with their pets. You are choosing now NOW to bring up problems with the lore?<br />
<br />
My new best friend. People defend the lore in this game more than they defend their Faith. It's the most patchworked game I know, but it's still a fun experience! There's ways to play it hardcore (minus DS, you guys really got shit on with that one), casual with normal modes and heroics, baddies with...fishing dailies...<br />
<br />
This is just another addition to add some variety. There isn't any good arguments to not develop it. We're still gonna get raids and dungeons. You cannot tell me that the pet battle system dev time could have equalled a new 5 man. There is no way. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lobosan</div><div class="date">2012-01-12, 08:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the reason so many people feel frustrated with the decision to ripoff pokemon is threefold. 1) First and foremost, it DOES take resources away from developing other, much needed improvements to gameplay, as Blizzard has constantly stated that time and money for these things are limited and the allocation to one slot removes the possibility for another project. A cosmetic fix to old player character models, or the often-promised dance studio, would likely be a far more desirable feature for the majority of the WoW community. Spending the time and money to develop non-cosmetic improvements, such as gameplay balance, innovative skill mechanics, more challenging boss fights, and more immersive storylines that don't dead-end (looking at you, Throne of the Tides) would be almost universally applauded and undeniably superior to pokepets. 2) It is a shamefully unprofessional thing for a company as powerful as Blizzard to resort to outright theft. This sort of thing is not only pandering to the pokemon fans and the gullible young, it's also smearing the name of a company (which we as players are associated with) by promoting the blatant theft of another company's intellectual property. Stealing pokemon rather than coming up with original ideas is a pathetically high-school level of digital plagiarism...and what's worse, Blizz didn't even make efforts to hide the fact that it was stolen, thereby demeaning not only their reputation, but the intellect of their player base. When a major corporation has to resort to this level of thievery, it pollutes the community which it created and indicates a serious problem with the company's ability to sustain a creative and professional environment. 3) It is not in keeping with the spirit and atmosphere of the game. This one is for those individuals who want to FEEL like they are actively engaging with a living, breathing world, in this case, the World of Warcraft. Much like the immersiveness of Skyrim that has made it so popular, WoW must (and typically used to) endeavor to keep easter eggs to a minimum and ultimately preserve the feel of a singular world with identifiable rules and characters. When you throw something like Pokemon into the World of Warcraft, it breaks the suspension of disbelief and fantasy atmosphere which many players rely on to have a good time in the game. Even if they are not battling with these pets, they will be forced to encounter them, or others battling with them/talking about them, which can spoil an otherwise unique role-playing experience. In addition, the pokebattles will lessen the &quot;cool&quot; factor which many hunters associate with pet ownership, turning a once-unique and rewarding gameplay mechanic which fit logically into the game's lore into a cheesy, lore-breaking, &quot;everyone can do it&quot; mechanic that will vastly lessen the unique fun factor associated with playing a hunter. I want to note that these are my opinions, NOT facts. But they are opinions which are shared by many, and I hope they will be considered with the same respect I would afford any fellow player. Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Well yeah...except this is a watered down rip off, from people pretending otherwise. If you want to play warcraft, log into warcraft. If you want to play pokemon, play pokemon. I just don't see why there wasn't anything more unique developed, instead. Nor how Blizz isn't getting sued, honestly.<br />

I completely understand being interested in a pet battle minigame. Pokemon was (possibly still is) fun! So...why would you use this watered-down version, rather than playing one much more intricate and customizable? It's okay to just log out of warcraft and do something else for a while, then log back in when you want to play warcraft.</div></div><hr />

No, that would be utterly ridiculous. You can't copyright game mechanics, if that was the case then FPS games would sue other FPS games for having the same style of play. If Blizzard had directly called it Pokemon or created creatures that are carbon copies of some Pokemon then there would be an issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They already have some with PVE scenarios and, arguably, the 'challenge mode' dungeons (which seems silly to me, but it doesn't manifest itself in the game world and I'm sure someone will enjoy it).<br />
<br />
If you want some ideas from me personally, right off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
Mounted combat: Combat using our actual mounts and our real weapons/spells. Being hit would damage your mount and eventually dismount you. While this might be an evolution of the jousting system, it would be important to make it feel like actual mounted combat as opposed to vehicle combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Single player dungeons: A new series of dungeons attuned for single player. These would not be rehashes, and would be complete with their own lore and quests. The player would get to choose 2 NPCs to help them, each having a different role (healer/tank/DPS) than the player. Gear would be worse than a normal, 5-player dungeon and would probably offer rewards similar to questing (mostly greens, maybe a blue at the end). At lower levels, these would serve as an alternative and supplement to questing and normal dungeons. At higher levels, the quest would be daily and would contain a variety of objectives. The dungeons would range in difficulty and would function as not only something to do, but also a tool to teach people mechanics of their class and to help learn the basics of more difficult PVE encounters (raids).<br />
<br />

The argument is that instead of a watered down pokemon rip-off, Blizz could have added something unique and more in line with existing warcraft mechanics (i.e. using your class abilities?). That way, people who want to play warcraft would have some new, unique thing to do...and people who want to play pokemon can log out of warcraft and go do it.<br />
<br />
Edit: Put otherwise, instead of spending resources on improving and expanding the existing mechanics of warcraft, that time and effort is being spent on a largely unrelated minigame, that's flatly and obviously a watered down equivalent of an existing game, already available in full form to the player base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is it? Are you aware that the team handling this isn't anyway in any fashion even able to be involved in raid or dungeon design?<br />
<br />
Greedy, greedy snowflakes. <br />
<br />
I think pvp is a waste of &quot;design time&quot; personally. I really do. Pve suffers dearly for it. Do I go around saying &quot;remove it! Stop focusing on it&quot;! Hell no! Know why? Cuz that's someone's FaVOTITE part of wow. And I wouldn't want to take that away from them, even if it means that I MIGHT get extra of something I already get. <br />
<br />
So, just sit back and hush up about them wasting time.<br />
<br />
As predicted, someone comes in &quot;this team could not be involved in that and that&quot;, yes Sherlock, but they could hire guys who can do stuff with raids, professions, quests you name it instead and spend just about as much cash on them as on the team working on this crap, which nobody wanted. <br />
<br />
Besides, you don't do one thing and one thing only. A programmer is a programmer, may he program/script pet battles or boss battles, a model designer is a model designer weather he designs 35 poly pets or 3500 poly bosses. So in fact yes, the whole team could switch and do something better with their time as this pokemon crap.<br />
<br />
This right here is the biggest gripe I had with the game for years. Actually I wouldn't mind this feature at all, if the game would be flourishing and every segment of the playerbase had things to do, but as it is now, the game is dull, cause there is not enough content for either side (the raiders and the non raiders), instead on focusing on that, they are focusing on a fucking pet battle system, and MoP will ship with 2-3 raid instances and 5-6 dungeons, which will get overplayed in the first 2 months and then it will be boredom hanging in Orgrimmar again for another 3-4 months, before they decide to release another raid with 6-8 bosses + 2 new or rehashed dungeons. <br />
<br />
You see, look at TBC, it had so much content, we were still having fun in SSC/TK when BT was released, this expansion and the expansion before, I'm already bored the fuck out of Dragonsoul, and where is new content, nowhere and everything is fucking rehashed to it's bones. Dragonsoul = copy+past Dragonblight with 2 holes, no roof, copy+paste Malygoss platform, copy+paste airship battle (changed horde ship model for alliance), and 2 tentacle fights which feel rather new, not a single new boss model up to the last 2 bosses etc. etc.<br />
<br />
And while they give us that rehashed crap, they tend to think it's smart to work on a damn pet bettle system instead of delivering content people haven't seen before a hundred times i.e. nothing reused, and lots of it, so the game doesn't get stale as piss the first month in release. But yeah sure, after pet battles let's make more nonsense decisions and create go-kart racing and invest heavily into it, they could clone mario kart I guess that's what people want in WoW right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue isn't this single feature, it's the trend of features that offer little to no improvement or extension of warcraft mechanics. If I want to play pokemon, I'll log out of warcraft and play pokemon. I can already do that. What I can't do is log out of warcraft to play warcraft.<br />
<br />
As with this, each feature doesn't have to be something every player is interested in. The difference is that I feel the features should revolve around improving and expanding upon this game, rather than flat out introducing other games into this engine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But instead, those 5% could be working on improvements and extensions of warcraft mechanics, instead of introducing other games (which I can play if I choose by playing them) into this engine. It doesn't matter the number of employees you want to claim; the issue is the attitude and trend, not the employee-hours. If I want to play pokemon, I'll log out of warcraft and play pokemon. If I want to play a game with warcraft's mechanics, I can't log out of warcraft and play another game. Thus, I'd prefer the additions to this game have to do with this game, is all.</div></div><hr />

What, are you saying 75% of development team is working on pet battles? Please, it probably only takes like 5% of people to work on this while 95% is working on other stuff such as old race updates, etc.<br />
<br />
Obviously Cataclysm is exact proof of limited resources. Neither Firelands nor Dragonsoul combined match the awesomness that was Ulduar. Both outdoor raids , one with random terrain which can be done with height maps in about 5 minutes, the other one a completely reused part Dragonblight zone from a previous expansion - and it's the final raid of the expansion. Give me a break, really. <br />
<br />
At least the 3 new dungeons show some interest of keeping this game fresh, while everything else stagnates. <br />
<br />
And as said before, I don't hate on Pokemon, it's not my game, but the game in itself is fine and I wouldn't even mind it in this game, but not when everything else is showing signs of stagnation and nothing is being done to revitalize the game at all. Copy+past is all they can do lately, while their player base is getting bored out of the socks. When is the MoP coming, I damn hope soon, since as said me and my guild are already god damn bored of Dragonsoul and all the new content 4.3 offered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really dont understand the fuzz about this? They are creating a whole new continent with lots of new content, new race, new starting zone and still people complain bout the newly inplented Pokewow.. <br />
<br />
I for one really like this feature, okay admitted didnt expected it in WOW but ive always felt like someone should have created Pokemon mmo since I was a huge pokemon fan. <br />
<br />
But I am really going to love hunting special companions at different times conditions. <br />
<br />
I really dont understand people asked for panda's people complain bout panda's. People have been asking for someting besides end game pvp/pve and now we get something new and it still isnt good enough... guess its just how the world rolls.. the grass is always greener in the past and on the other side...</div></div><hr />

Hating MoP or WoW because of this 1 feature is like saying &quot;baww I'm hardcore PvP'er ALL of the PvE content should be removed from WoW&quot;. <br />
<br />
It's easy to just type random hate in forums without even saying a good reason, &quot;blah blah general whining pokemon blah blah pokemon blah&quot;. Let's see some of you post some new features that WoW should have, majority will just ignore this because they can't literally think of a single new feature that would be feasible to 'everyone'.<br />
<br />
The issue isn't &quot;I want features that only suite me!&quot; it's &quot;I want features relative to this universe and this gamestyle.&quot; Pet battles do not belong here - they are a shoehorned, nonsensical distraction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So take out the &quot;who-disagree-with-you.&quot; My point stands.<br />
<br />
My overall argument, I'll repeat, is that pokemon already exists. If I want to play pokemon, I can do so by logging out of warcraft and playing pokemon. If I want to play a game with warcraft's mechanics, however, I don't have the option of logging out of warcraft to do it. Accordingly, my preference would be for Blizzard to focus their new features on improvements and extensions of this game's mechanics, rather than introducing other, existing games to this engine. I don't take issue with pet battles in particular, but rather with what I hope doesn't become more of a trend with new features being largely unrelated to existing mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
now i could be wrong,and blizz can do whatever they like with their game and yeah i can choose not to do it, and heck maybe it will be really good, but lets say it turns out medicore at best or like 10% of its gaming population cares about it after launch. was all this development time and effort really worth it? could be spending that time making even more content ,fixing the game or something much more likely relevent.again i understand ,all subjective and remains to be seen.i dont make multi million dollar games...but... again i say, who exactly is this stuff catering too? because i have personally no idea,are the majority of wow players pokemon players or something?, because like i said i know a ton of folk in and out of game that play wow and not a one cares or plays pokemon..... ./shrug<br />
<br />
again the point is ,and some you dont seem to get from reading these posts, its not about that its a pokemon ripoff its about doing something else with the development time...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference, Diggasson, is that if you want to play pokemon, you can go do it. There's nothing at all wrong with simply logging out of warcraft to play a different style of game. If you want to play a game with warcraft's mechanics, however, you're limited to the additional content improving upon and expanding those mechanics.<br />
<br />
Requesting pet battles, in fact, would make more sense among pokemon players who want more content than it does among warcraft players who want more content.<br />
<br />
It's not about introducing specific features desired by individual players. It's about an overall preference for features improving and expanding warcraft mechanics, so as to provide more gameplay in keeping with this game, rather than introducing other games, at best tangentially related to warcraft mechanics, that you can already enjoy by playing those games in full form.<br />

<br />
And that's exactly what I'm getting at. If you want to play pokemon, you already can. There's a huge amount of content already out there, waiting for you. If you're looking for new warcraft content (by which I mean content based on warcraft mechanics and gameplay), you don't have that option.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you're looking for new pokemon content, because you've run out of pokemon games to play, wanting pet battles makes a lot of sense.</div></div><hr />

Eh, I don't know that I'd claim it just doesn't belong. If Blizzard hired the Pokemon developer/programmer team to create a warcraft minigame, I really wouldn't have a problem with that. My issue isn't that a minigame largely unrelated to warcraft mechanics is being introduced, it's that it's being introduced in place of work by the same team on improvements and expansions upon warcraft mechanics.<br />
<br />
Edit: Clarification. Nor would I, personally, claim that it does belong. I just mean that saying &quot;it doesn't belong&quot; seems to me to be an indefensible position.</div></div><hr />

That's part of the reason I'm saying it doesn't belong. While I feel very strongly that it doesn't fit with the lore, it also clashes with the style of game. I see and have seen no reason to push an entirely different game into World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

More variety is always good, even if it is a pokemon rip off. I'm excited for it.<br />
<br />
I'm not really opposed, I wouldn't use it, but I know others that would. The point is that these new optional gameplay features take up quite a bit of development time (initial/bugfix/updates). You have to realize: if you don't partake in pet battles and other 'small' cosmetic new features coming in MoP; is there still enough in game to keep you interested?<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm getting too old for this game; there are quite a few 15-16 y/o guys in game and on forums that interests are quite different from mine and my idea what you should be interested in at that age. My perspective; girls; sex; games; music; sports; friends. Some guys (not all ofc); ponies; 'squee' things; girly things. I've seen an 24 y/o heterosexual male post on a forum (not this one) 'Squeeeee, that's so cute &lt;3' as a response to a video. But maybe that is just a cover-up to get into a girl her pants, seeing that is the meaning of life after all :P <br />

Would you mind explaining to me how it's only Blizzard's job to cater to their subscribers and make them happy if the subscribers in question are casuals or unskilled?<br />
<br />
Like it or not, casual players have been keeping this game going for a long long time now. Hardcore players make up a very small minority, hence why Blizzard has consistently made content more accessible to players with less time (or arguable less skill) to dedicate to the game at least since Wrath.<br />
<br />
So yeah, as a business Blizzard have to keep their casual subscribers happy as well as having the unenviable task of trying to balance enjoyment for the hardcore players too. Pet battles takes nothing away from the game and there is clearly a lot of people who are really looking forward to it. As for myself the jury is still out on whether I'll make use of the feature, but if I end up not using it I'm not going to moan about how it's ruining the game.</div></div><hr />

If your primary motivation for wanting pet battles is that you don't currently have a system on which to play pokemon, that just isn't a logical reason to introduce pet battles.

Um...yes, you can.<br />
1) Log into warcraft. Enter queue.<br />
2) Start a gameboy, gamecube, emulator in another window, or any of the other ways to play pokemon.<br />
3) Play pokemon.<br />
4) Pause pokemon and accept queue.<br />
<br />
This is exactly my point: your gaming experience, on the whole, is not affected positively by being able to play watered-down-pokemon inside warcraft, given you can already play a full version anyway. Instead, I'd prefer to see warcraft features focus on warcraft mechanics, that is, on gameplay I can't get outside of warcraft.</div></div><hr />

Opportunity cost. They also add nothing to a gamer's experience, as you can already play pokemon (even while playing warcraft, of course). In their place, we could instead have improved and expanded warcraft mechanics, which we can't get from another game.<br />
<br />
I do agree, of course, that pet battles aren't ruining the game. Should the trend of warcraft features focusing away from warcraft mechanics continue, however, the game in its current genre and style of gameplay would certainly cease to exist.</div></div><hr />

Why did Blizzard make more than one Flying mount Model?<br />
Why did Blizzard revamp the old world?<br />

That's just the way the internet works and my side just has the advantage of being able to put on a troll face and state that it's happening whether you like it or not.<br />
<br />
Here's my problem.<br />
<br />
My point is that Blizz resources are being spent reinventing the wheel. Your overall experience as a gamer is not being improved by being able to play pokemon in warcraft, given that you can already do so out of warcraft (even while also playing warcraft). Accordingly, I would prefer those resources to be spent increasing our total options.<br />
<br />
Your point is that you think pet battles will be fun.<br />
<br />
Thus, my point accepts yours. I recognize that you think the pokemon-style of gameplay is fun (I even agree with you) and offer the logical conclusion that you could have your cake and eat it, too: play pokemon for your pokemon-style gameplay, and get additional improvements and expansions on warcraft mechanics from Blizzard. You can have the best of both worlds. I've even noted the situation in which pet battles would be the best option: if you're a pokemon fan who has already run out of pokemon-style content, and is looking for more.<br />
<br />
Your point sidesteps mine.<br />
<br />
Argument A accepts argument B, and offers a direct, logical conclusion on how to address both at once.<br />
Argument B ignores argument A.<br />
So yes, you can put on a troll face if you prefer, but I honestly just don't understand why you would.</div></div><hr />

The fans have been asking for this for years. Many a start-up has been legally shutdown by Nintendo for obvious infringement rights. OFC Blizzard are Pokemon fans. Deep down, who isnt? <br />
<br />
Blizzard is famous for their talent of taking many different inspirations and concepts from established outlets and cooking them together to craft masterpieces. If you didn't see this coming you are truly blind. Learn to see past your own biases and see the big picture here. <br />
<br />
At the very LEAST, when this turns out to be a huge hit, hopefully the execs over at Nintendo will give the green light for a 100% kosher Pokemon MMO. I, for one, welcome our new vanity pet overlords =)</div></div><hr />

Is it okay that PvP'ers Complain that Blizzard is developing new raids?<br />
<br />
No, I'm not. Both warcraft PvP and warcraft PvE contain mechanics and elements unique to this game. Accordingly, whether or not I, personally, enjoy those features, I find it logical and desirable for Blizzard to work on them. Likewise for your other points.<br />
<br />
Pet battles are very clearly a watered down version of a mechanics system already available to us. They only very tangentially relate to warcraft mechanics. I just want the best of both worlds: I can get my pet-battle-style-gameplay fix from pokemon, and my warcraft-style-gameplay fix from warcraft. In order to maximize the total content available to me, as I have not come close to running out of pokemon content (nor will, in the foreseeable future), is for the warcraft team to develop more warcraft content.<br />
<br />
I take as an assumption that that last is also true for the majority of the player base; that is, that most players interested in pokemon-style content have likewise neither run out, nor expect to run out, of such content in the existing pokemon games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even though I am too old to have ever gotten into Pokemon, I will certainly try out pet battles, and if I enjoy them I will keep playing them... However, I think all of you appologists using this argument are missing the point.<br />
<br />
Collecting non-combat pets is something I already do to keep myself busy in WoW... and I very much enjoy this aspect of the game as it is right now. If I happen not to enjoy pet battles, I will either have to trudge through it for the sake of my collection, or give up something I used to like. So it's not completely optional, nor is it entirely harmless... It is possible that this feature will make the game less enjoyable for me and other collectors. <br />
<br />
Since it doesn't make much sense to even have pet battles in WoW (certainly not PvE ones, against tiny creatures a lvl 90 could just grab and stuff in his bag), and it's not only adding to, but fundamentally changing an existing feature, I think people have a right to be concerned... Especially if they played Pokemon and know better what to expect.</div></div><hr />

Right, you do know its the UI team making this addition? The UI team don't make all the mechanics for WoW, it's one of those things that UI team gets to work on in their spare time while everyone else works on their own thing. It isn't taking anything away from the game, development time etc. If anything, in the end, we'll get more little additions by the UI team to do at level 90+.<br />

That a good point. I may be annoyed myself, but thats how it is. <br />

Either this will take away resources and time from the rest of the game, or Blizzard has been leading us on for the entirety of Cataclysm. In a recent interview, they even said that the 1-60 leveling was the reason for the lack of end game content. They tell us that every new feature - LFD, LFR, Transmog, etc. - takes away from their ability to push content in one way or another.</div></div><hr />

Then why is it so wrong in your mind to play it within warcraft? You say that it is fine as long as I log out of your game and play it some were it doesnt effect wow.

Screw all the RP'ers....? Why did Blizzard make more than one Ground mount model? Why did Blizzard make more than one Flying mount Model? Why did Blizzard make the Achivement system? (Rip off from other games) Warcraft's base style of gameplay does already include a degree of personalization of your avatars. Just as how different armor and weapons possess different appearances, so too the various ground and flying mount models. Likewise, my point is not that no other particular aspect of other games can serve as an improvement upon or expansion of warcraft mechanics. The achievement system, as an example, serves (at least in part) to highlight and recognize particular styles of warcraft-mechanics gameplay (ranging from leveling up to making use of professions to using particular tactics on encounters). The pet battle system's biggest tie to warcraft mechanics is that it uses the pets your toon has. It has absolutely nothing to do with your avatar's customization, class abilities, racial lore, etc. It adds nothing to RP; you can already talk about your favorite pets and generate stories about their triumphs (the warcraft mechanics, I'll note, do not actually lend themselves to RP any moreso than would a sandbox plus chat server--DnD 3.5 4eva!). It introduces mechanics wholly disparate from existing warcraft mechanics. Is that necessarily a bad thing? No. Introducing completely new mechanics is how new game genres get created! But in this specific case, Blizzard is flat out reinventing the wheel. If you want to play pokemon while logged into warcraft, you already can. Unless you've run out of pokemon content, you're gaining no additional hours of mini-monster-fighting gameplay. Were the warcraft features focused on warcraft mechanics, however, you would gain, relatively, additional hours of warcraft-mechanics gameplay.<br />

<br />
Your actual argument is that the entire pet battle system, with the significant and obviously non-UI-related depth (yet still only a shadow of actual pokemon games), is taking no resources from other potential features? If so, that's something we'll just have to disagree on. I readily admit that I have no hard evidence of my claim; I merely offer it as common sense. No group of people can do more than X things at once. For each employee-hour spent on this feature, that's one fewer that could be spent on features relating to warcraft mechanics.</div></div><hr />

The difference is, Arena was an extension of the current PVP content and dailies were an extension of the current PVE content. <br />

<br />
If you look through this thread, you'll see plenty of people defending this - many times using the exact same argument, regardless of what's been said. You have a pretty loud bark when you can't even hear the other dogs. This isn't limited to the forums, either; even as someone who avoids Trade chat, I see plenty of people talking about this in-game.<br />
<br />
As for your final point in this paragraph, I've seen plenty from this preview. Either the final product is going to be COMPLETELY different, or every point I've made has been informed. <br />
<br />
<br />

It's closer to 85.8%, but only 95.84% of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing! As I mentioned, if Blizzard simply hired out the pokemon dev/programmer team to create a port of pokemon into warcraft, I'd have no problem. My concern is that the feature neither improves upon nor expands warcraft gameplay mechanics, but instead reinvents the wheel on gameplay mechanics to which we already have access.<br />
<br />
Edit: I am assuming, under such a case, that the money spent comes from funds that would not otherwise be allocated to additional development of warcraft-mechanics gameplay. Similarly, if it turns out that pet battles are already being developed by a team hired specifically for that purpose (or, similarly, if existing employees are spending and being paid for hours they would not have otherwise spent working on the game), and the money to fund that team would not have been spent on warcraft otherwise, I withdraw my objections. I do not, however, believe that to be the case. If I'm mistaken, by all means, please link me to that (verifiable) information.</div></div><hr />

That's not a good analogy. It's closer to you wanting there to be a baseball within the football game, and others thinking that doesn't make any sense and you should just go watch baseball.</div></div><hr />

By that logic I shouldn't be able to /dance. Another game does it better.<br />
Why auto attack when I can play a fighting game?<br />
Flip my Dalaran coin? Another game does it better.<br />
Ride a mount? Another game does it better.<br />
<br />
By that logic Blizzard should remove vanity pets altogether. Sounds to me like you have something against WoW in general. Oh, and that website they have? Get rid of it too. Half of the UI changes since launch have been direct copies of fanmade addons. Lets go back to the UI of launch day.... No.<br />
<br />
WoW is an MMO. There hasnt been a Pokemon-styled MMO yet. MMO + Pokemon = Win. WoW has vanity pets. People wanted their vanity pets to battle since day 1. WoW + Pokemon = Win.<br />

I was going to ask you to define 'warcraft' but then reality hit me; Blizzard = Warcaft. Like it or not.</div></div><hr />
