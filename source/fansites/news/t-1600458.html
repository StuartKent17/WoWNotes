You can see that Jay Wilson is now listed as a Designer now, rather than just being on the strike team like he was for Mists of Pandaria (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/september/credits_MoP.html).

Warlords of Draenor - Post-Squish Legacy Content<br />
I should have phrased my initial post(s) better. The intent certainly wasn't a blanket dismissal of concerns about new difficulties with soloing content that you can handle easily in 5.4.<br />
<br />
Right now, there is a known bug (for which we should have a fix in an upcoming build) that is causing raid bosses (especially in Cataclysm content) to be more challenging for level 90 players than is the intent. There are also specific issues with encounters that we're still hand-adjusting (Gunship in Icecrown, notably). That will get sorted out. The overwhelming majority of players shouldn't see any negative impact to their legacy content experience when they go from 5.4 to 6.0.<br />
<br />
The sole exception here, which is what I was clarifying, is that if there's an encounter that you can just barely solo as a tank spec on live today, it's quite possible that you won't quite be able to do so in 6.0. It's also possible that something you can solo comfortably today might be slightly harder in 6.0, but still doable. But that's because of basic changes to self-healing and the potency of tank cooldowns, and not anything related to our item or stat changes. And in any case, I'm talking about smaller differences here, not something like getting destroyed by Morchok when you can solo him easily on live, which is the result of a bug.<br />

Keep it civil please. Weapon size is a subjective preference. A change would upset some, please others. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/514905913124065280))<br />
Either way, I'm not aware of any plans to change them. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/514905964344901632))<br />

Garrisons<br />
If I build an enchanting building and a jewelcrafting building is there still a point for me to still have those professions?<br />
Having the profession yourself doubles (I think) the daily cooldown production, and gives access to some extra recipes. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/514609897887911936))<br />

<br />
Remember they have to credit anyone that's had the slightest hand in bringing the expansion to light , even the GMs.<br />

Its fully possible Jay Wilson contributed a long time ago and his contributions have been &quot;revised&quot; off the table.</div></div><hr />

You do remember that he was one of the presenters at Blizzcon last year. One would presume that he did some design work on the expansion prior to that.<br />
<br />
As for the Jay Wilson trolling, jeez. He's way down the list and probably has zero influence on much of anything. If this were a movie he'd be at the level of &quot;Man at Bar&quot;. Predictable reaction I guess but pointless.</div></div><hr />

But really, he could have just pointed at a screen and said, &quot;hey put a tree there&quot; and he'd still be in the credits, individuals overall have very little influence over the game as a whole.<br />

<br />
Also, so much for battle fatigue and resilience going. I see player damage reduction is back and all I can say is - well done, you spent 3 years trying to design around not having any and you failed.

Nope, it's a flag that describes the type of build. Pure development builds are never flagged as release, this is the first one for this development cycle that is. It usually means that this build might as well go live as it is. We're definitely close. They might still put out the arena warning today and send it live next week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, he's no different than you. Just a human, made of the same shit you're made of. But you feel like you have some internet justice card that lets you act like an asshole to him, and honestly anyone else you want. Just let it go and grow up.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I hope this build fixes all of the bugs the current (as of last night, anyway) build has... almost every instance I went into had a boss where one of the boss moves would instantly DC you if you got hit by it (Bonemaw, for one...).</div></div><hr />

There is more discussion here about 1 singular dude of over 100 individuals working on WoW, than the actual changes. You gamers need to let your problems with Jay Wilson go. He's just a dude, and he fucked up no less than any of you have fucked up in your life. His was just more public, and it's unfair of you to continue to have problems with him. <br />
<br />

<br />
Ok, now we all know which account on here belongs to Jay's mom.<br />
<br />
Jay had an entire community of people telling him not to do many of the things he did. He did them anyway because &quot;fuck that guy&quot;. Now look what they've had to do to fix the game. People make mistakes, but being arrogant and not listening to the fans of the game you're working on is idiotic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, Jay Wilson pushed TOO HARD the freedom and patience Blizzard had on developing games. He pushed the release for YEARS, threw away works many times, never used the beat to REALLY test the game in the name of keeping the story from stupid spoilers, that went out anyway, and as a cherry on top threw the ass-kissers from his team as a gang into the guy that MADE Diablo, PLUS separated the people who were invited in Beta into &quot;special snowflakes&quot; category and gave them something to throw in the faces of the &quot;common folk&quot;.<br />
<br />
In development side he made TWO MAJOR MISTAKES:<br />
1) Made the b.net team that wasn't a proprietary team of D3, but something shared through all the Blizzard developers put all the connection resources into the auction House, generating the infamous error 37. People couldn't play to fill itAnd anyone a bunch of miles away from the servers had serious connection issues to a game which UNNECESSARILY demand always connected as DRM.<br />
2) Spent the VAST MAJORITY of the money Blizzard put in development in art and cinematics, and the IMPORTANT teams, as systems, items, skills, magics, enemy behavior etc, where made by teams of ONE TENTH of the minimum necessary in amount of developers. Some &quot;teams&quot; were even made by a SINGLE developer.<br />
<br />
Day Wilson Lost his touch, and his kind of behavior would be way more for the present Bioware, than Blizzard. In their forums he would be probably celebrated. I have been saying for long that Jay Wilson BELONGS to EA.</div></div><hr />

Gotta agree this false scarcity stuff is BS. You can still get shadowmourne, the bow, DW;TW, the Ulduar mace, etc. Maybe they're removing it because it will be so weak going forward?<br />

I really don't want an RMAH in wow. But then I didn't want them to remove flying either. And resilience has been a terrible idea since it was added. World pvp should use gear scaling based on your level. There. Done. Let 'teh hardcore' be 1337 in arenas.</div></div><hr />

It scales based on your stats and is BiS at level 100 I would have to guess that is why it is being removed so people do not feel like they have to do this to be accepted into raids.<br />

I hope that's not true, because otherwise I think most raiders will find themselves locked only to the classes that they've completed the cloak on. :( (Why bring Joe's warrior when Tom's warrior has the cloak and Joe can't even *get* the cloak anymore?)<br />

I can't find anything on that at all. What I'm guessing is he misread a quote from one of the Blues saying the &quot;Cloak will last you to level 100&quot; which went on to say &quot;to be replaced by a dungeon blue&quot;. It doesn't sound like they'll be anything beyond what we've come to expect from 'endgame gear' in previous expansions, lasting you all the way through the leveling process and maybe even matching with Heroic dungeon gear.</div></div><hr />

it isn't. dev posts confirmed that its powerful enough to last us to level 100 stat and ability-wise, between 90 an 100 the proc rate for the ability will reduce till it hits 0 at level 100.<br />

i think you will find that before the newest expansion is released they are already making the next one, a blue post even said it on the front page last month that they are already away with designing the next expansion after Wod. So yea im not surprised his name is credited.<br />

humm, well it sell so many copies because it is a very famous and expected sequel of Diablo series. Was not because Jay W. was &quot;the man&quot;.<br />
