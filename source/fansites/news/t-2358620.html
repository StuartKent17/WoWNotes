Winter Veil Gifts<br />
Just wanted to confirm there was indeed an issue affecting the Gently Shaken Gift, it not being available right away for characters that looted it last year.<br />
<br />
This however has now been hotfixed and everyone should be able to get their 6th gift, the Hearthstation, without having to resort to any workaround (Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17617662554?page=2#34))<br />

wtf are you smoking? Can I have some?<br />

Since when are squiggles SS Runes? And Since when is Santa (or technically the father of Winterviel or whatever) a Christian figure? Hell Christmas isn't even Christian, it's Pagen - Christians just stole the date (L2History).<br />

I think you are refering to Basil of Caesarea or Saint Nicholas<br />
Santa as we know him today has nothing to do with Christianity. Plz educate yourself before you speak<br />
As for the Nazi symbols what can i say . As someone said before me. Tell me what you smoke because i want some........<br />

Same here, Very annoying! And just because this disgusting abomination can sit, doesn't mean I'll ever use it:D I just wish they'd change the glyphs so we can use whichever form glyphs we want, I don't really see why they limit it to just one form variation glyph allowed at once=/</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one with Arthas looks like the cover of a kitchen novel while C'thun looks like Hearthstone art.<br />
That's because the art was done by an artist for Hearthstone. It's why the art style is so different (and incompatible) with Vol. 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but that Chronicles vol 3 art sucks.<br />
<br />
It's so bad compared to the usual stuff by masters like Wei Wang. What happened?<br />
Wei Wang left Blizzard Entertainment in January '17 to work for another company.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Also, for those who are disappointed with the artwork (and I share your sentiment)... you're going to be even more disappointed with how Vol. 3 covers the lore of Warcraft. Have fun with Blizzard cramming WC3 through Cataclysm into less than 200 pages. TBC and WotLK are also going to be more about Illidan and Arthas, respectively, even though both of them have their very own novels.</div></div><hr />

What was in the first two books was amazing and is some of my all-time favourite, whereas I've seen fan art that looks better than this. I respect the effort of whoever did this, but it really does look like fan art and doesn't do characters such as Arthas any justice; he looks like a prince made by Disney and Jaina looks like she is about to lose her shoe while running away as midnight nears. Varian looks like he is taking Anduin to a fan art contest.</div></div><hr />
