Fake patch 3.1 notes update: A lot of people have been reporting notes for the upcoming Patch 3.1. These notes are fake, they're a compilation of already-known info with a lot of stupid additions and you should definitely not trust them. You can find these notes here (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/wow310fakenotes.txt) because deleting the post will just cause 3 of them to appear in the next 5 minutes. I know that these posts were first reported on an official fansite but that's definitely not an excuse you should be using to trust them, if they're not from Blizzard or from patch files, just call them fake. <br />

Rating system changes last night<br />
We made some adjustments to the rating system last night that are now in effect.<br />
<br />
1. Personal Ratings will now always trend toward Team Ratings (instead of the internal matchmaking rating). This should eliminate the odd behavior players noticed of seeing their PR change in ways that seemed bizzare. It also eliminates the possibility that you can play every game with your team, yet be ineligible to get items when the team qualifies for them (or ineligible to receive full points).<br />
2. You will now gain or lose around 12 points when winning or losing to teams of roughly equivalent matchmaking rating to your own team (previously this number was 8 ).<br />
3. The rating scale has been extended to a range of 240 to about 2800 to more accurately reflect what was possible under the old system. This means that most players over 1500 will experience some slightly easier than expected rating gain as their team adjusts upward to the new scale.<br />
4. Players with less than 1500 rating will still get the same number of points as players at 1500. <br />
<br />
It is now easier to get higher ratings<br />
It is easier to get higher ratings due to the scale adjustment. However, I'd still expect a very small percentage of the population to get the arena master achievement, by no means would I call it trivialized. <br />
<br />
Q&amp;A<br />
Is hidden rating wiped on character transfer?<br />
No<br />
<br />
What determines hidden rating besides win/loss? Resilience, damage, healing?<br />
Only winning/losing determines the rating <br />
<br />
What is the min/max amount of points able to be lost/won now?<br />
24<br />
<br />
Is the TR/PR cap still 3000 with these changes?<br />
Yes TR/PR do still have a hard cap at 3k, although we don't expect players to get that high regardless. <br />
<br />
Is any of the rating affected by your gear?<br />
None of the rating systems have the slightest clue or are in any way affected by what gear you have. <br />
<br />
How can the ratings not get that high if numerous teams get to 2700+? Are there diminishing returns on the amount of rating you can gain off another team despite team ratings being similarly high?<br />
It certainly is possible to get that high legitimately, although it would be unusual. There's about a 2% chance of seeing a 3000 rated team in a population size of 20,000 teams... about a 5% chance of seeing one in a population of 50,000 teams. So, with the number of battlegroups in existence it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility to see a 3k team. Grats to them. =] <br />

Ulduar gear quality<br />
It's not likely. Some of the heroic dungeon and heroism gear is fully comparable to some of the Naxx 10-man stuff. Keep in mind though that heroic 5-man and heroism progression won't be keeping pace with 10-man Ulduar when it comes out. You won't be as likely to find items in 10-man Ulduar that are sub-par to the heroism and heroic 5-man loot. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14697303593-10-man-naxx-gear-needs-a-buff-imo.html))<br />
<br />
Class balancing / Target Dummy DPS<br />
We don’t treat classes like children, making sure everyone has the same number of cookies. I see players sometimes listing patch notes as “Their class got 41 buffs while ours only got 12” which is a silly thing to say on so many levels. We buff when we need to buff and nerf when we need to nerf. We don’t dwell on how often or what magnitude those changes are. We are more concerned about balance than fairness, if that makes sense (note to self: you will almost certainly be clarifying that statement for months to come). When we don’t make a change that we want to, it is almost certainly because there is a technical or design limitation preventing it. Players may perceive that as “it doesn’t matter if they’re overpowered for awhile.” <br />
<br />
One more thing I would like to add is that there is no concept of “hunters do X dps.” You can generate numbers on a target dummy, or numbers on Patchwerk, or numbers for Naxx, or numbers for Naxx bosses. All of those are numbers are likely to be different, and that is something we want. We want every encounter to be different. We want some classes to so better on some fights than others. It’s more interesting that way than if every encounter in the game always produced the same classes in the same stack rank. A big disconnect between the community and the developers is that we don’t accept dps as an absolute number. It is relative and it is nebulous. The community with its spreadsheets and target dummies more often views it as an absolute. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14697301211-so-whats-the-plan-for-hunters.html))<br />
<br />
Buffing vs Nerfing<br />
Look, all things considered we would much rather buff than nerf. Players love it when they get buffed. The sun comes out and the birds are singing. When we nerf a class we get (I kid you not) death threats. So we must have a really good reason for nerfs.<br />
<br />
Usually the reason is that we have absolute, not relative targets. If you are in a raid and someone is doing 8000 dps, sure the &quot;fun&quot; solution is to buff every other class up to that point. If we end up over-buffing someone to 8500 dps, well then we can go back and give everyone else additional buffs. Maybe at level 90 everyone will be doing 12,000 dps, but inflation is inflation, right? Right? Of course we'd have to buff all the monsters too. We'd probably have to buff gear and talents because otherwise their contributions might seem paltry (I get 20 more dps when I do 8000 dps? lol.). In short the changes necessary to avoid a nerf just spiral out of control.<br />
<br />
I am talking mostly about PvE here. The balance for PvP is quite different and while raw power is certainly a factor, specific abilities and their cooldowns and synergies are usually far more important. The same thing is true though. If a particular form of CC is too potent, then in order to avoid nerfing it, we would have to give lots of other classes better ways of breaking CC. Then the original player feels gimpy so we give him the &quot;this CC cannot be broken&quot; ability. The vicious cycle still exists. Sometimes a single nerf, even if it's unpopular, is a ton less work than a lot of buffs, and sometimes it is just better for the game regardless.<br />
<br />
Some players ask: Isn't this what betas and PTRs are for? That is true. But it often isn't enough. MMOs are living games. Things change over time. Players are crafty and find new ways of using abilities to do things we didn't anticipate. Software has bugs, and sometimes they aren't uncovered even with the most rigorous QA. Rather than denying that these problems can arise, we would rather just be open about them and get them fixed as quickly as we can. (I didn't say &quot;quickly,&quot; I said &quot;as quickly as we can.&quot;)<br />
<br />
One of the things we are trying to do is get changes turned around in a more timely manner. In the past if a class or spec was too weak they often had to just suck it up until the next tier of content is released. I think the community wasn't necessarily prepared for this, which is why you see some &quot;roller coaster&quot; feedback. Other players, we know, are thrilled that issues might actually get looked at quickly instead of going on and on. And to be fair, we can be even faster and there are problems that have persisted for longer than we would like, but WoW is a big game and supertankers don't turn on a dime.

[EU] New English Realm - Saurfang<br />
The basics<br />
Realm name: Saurfang<br />
Language: English<br />
Realm type: Normal (PvE)<br />
Battlegroup: Misery<br />
Migration: No<br />
Realm forums: http://forums.wow-europe.com/board.html?forumId=8637322 (http://forums.wow-europe.com/board.html?forumId=8637322)<br />
<br />
In a few words<br />
Today we're opening a new English Normal/PvE realm, named Saurfang, in the Misery Battlegroup. This is a fresh realm, thus no migration will be allowed to the realms during the first 90 days. Also, the Ahn'Qiraj gates and Sunwell will be closed, and you can't create a Death Knight on the realm until you have another level 55 character there (or 90 days have passed).<br />
<br />
The realm will open this afternoon.<br />
<br />
Please note that the starting areas may be quite flooded in the beginning, and the population cap is intentionally set a bit lower than normal to not have them even more flooded. The cap will be raised over the coming days as the population spreads out more. <br />
<br />
Class balancing methodology (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14697301234-sorry-blizz-doesnt-balance-based-on-qq.html))<br />
1. Lets accept that class balance for PvP when it comes to this forum (Healing) is at an all time low.<br />
If you mean there are too many paladins and not enough other healers, then we agree.<br />
<br />
2. Lets agree that by opening up the raiding content to everyone by easing its difficulty level you have increased the number of players who will express their opinions about the state of their class. <br />
We also agree. We also think this is a good thing. <br />
<br />
3. We all already agree that balancing classes around both Arena and PvE is what creates many of the problems here. <br />
It creates problems, sure. I’m not sure I would argue it is the overwhelming factor though. Many players are worried about, e.g. whether their raid buff merits being invited to a raid, which has no PvP ramifications. Many players want to have more CC or CC breaks, which has very few PvE implications. <br />
<br />
4. Lets agree that Recount stats and WWS reports dictate how players feel their class stands up against others and that you re-balance spells based off this data. (Dont take this to mean only effective healing/damage numbers)<br />
Players place too much emphasis on this. It’s a tool. Balancing around recount stats is like using a thermometer to predict the weather. <br />
<br />
5. Lets agree that out of the thousands of posts made to expore ideas for balancing a specific class that only 5-10 posts, made by extremely knowledgeable individuals who have skill at being able to express their ideas in written form, merit your full attention. <br />
I disagree a little. Sometimes the most misinformed, confused players are the ones who will benefit most from a blue post. There are plenty of players who don’t speak English as their first language who may be extremely knowledgeable but can’t express their ideas as clearly as a native speaker. Their posts are not invalid. <br />
<br />
6. If every so often you made a post which outlines all the core issues the developers are concerned with it might alleviate some of the frustrations players have of trying to pick your brain.<br />
We do, but probably not as often as you would like.<br />
<br />
This gets a little bit into the player 2 mindset though (less so this specific post than similar comments in this thread). Usually when players say this they mean “I didn’t like that you responded to that post and I think you should have responded to this other post.” (Many but not all times “this other post” is theirs.) This is why I implore players to not raise a stink about where I post. It's not productive and not really the intent of this forum. When we want to outline the issues we are concerned with, we'll do that. Selfishly, we get a lot more out of player posts than we get from offering a Q&amp;A. I don't mind a Q&amp;A from time to time, but understand that 90% of my motivation to be here is selfish -- it helps us make the game better. <br />
<br />
I think the majority of posters need to realize that there is a more complicated decision-making process involved in improving a game like WoW than simply looking at pages of angry threads and saying &quot;ok, we'll do this&quot;.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, Blizzard eats its own dog food. They understand pretty well how their game works and if 10 million+ players see a problem with something, chances are PRETTY good they do too. Community feedback always happens and is encouraged, but that shouldn't automatically translate to a decision to appease the masses. Blizzard doesn't make changes to shut you up. They make changes to improve the game. If improving the game shuts you up, bonus.<br />
Well said. <br />

Unleashed Rage<br />
When we have an announcement on changes I'm sure you won't miss it. But yes we recognize this talent is expensive in a way the same buff is not for other classes. We didn't change it at the time because Enhancement was doing great damage. That is still the case, so we need to take a bigger look at the whole tree to make changes, but we hope to do so for 3.1.

Surely there is things here that won't be on the official patch notes, things like:<br />
- Chaos Bolt: Cooldown reduced to 8 seconds, base damage increased slightly. Also pierces through immunity effects such as Divine Shield and Ice Block.<br />
GC already said they won't do that.<br />

The patch notes are good for laughs indeed. Many of the changes are just things people want so much, like &quot;XXXX will no longer lag&quot;. Things like that never appear on patch notes.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree with some of the more recent posts here....most of this is probably real. In fact, 100% of the time I see patch notes that don't look like they are written by a 5-year-old, the majority of it is true. And what's more, what isn't true could have just been things that Blizzard changed in development and/or PTR since the time the notes were possibly leaked. The only thing I really have a hard time believing is that there is a new raid in Dragonblight. If Blizzard only announces this prior to the PTR launch, then I'm buying into these notes hook line and sinker.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deceiver</div><div class="date">2009-02-01, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">- Kick: Damage dealt significantly increased.<br />
<br />
Definitely not real, I mean Blizzard would never phrase a change like adding high damage to kick like this, since like all standard interrupts it deals no damage at all. Changing kick and not the other abilities also makes no sense at all.<br />
<br />
Also whoever wrote that clearly has a thing against prot warriors, I laughed when I got to the warrior section. Sweeping buffs across the board for nearly every class, even many who don't need it, then they completely crush the fun aspects of prot tree by making warbringer and critical block useless, nerfing shield wall so it's now worse than the (talented) paladin ability and for some reason removing Fury threat reduction.<br />
<br />
And the druid shapeshifting change? Erm, right.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just realised something else that I forgot to mention that's even worse. <br />
<br />
<br />
Warbringer: Reduces the rage cost of your Charge, Intercept and Intervene abilities by 100%.<br />
<br />
Reduces the rage cost of charge! From what, 0 to 0?</div></div><hr />

To manage that they need to add at least one every (major) content patch if their goal is to release new expansions more often (as was suggested some time ago in a blizzcast if im not mistaken). And i doubt they'd want to cream in more than one in such a patch as it would devalue its fun/flare factor.<br />
<br />
but yes, alot of the stuff reeks of 'fake'. The shadows are all wrong etc. Still alot of it are hopefully getting implemented (like crystalsong forest hubs and rep gain from BG marks).<br />
And coming to Potency - would make it quite godly for rogues? They really need to take another look at spell penetration either way.</div></div><hr />

You're thinking too simple. The reds, greens and bronzes are currently, as one ingame faction, working with the mortal races (including the players) to stop Malygos and later take care of Arthas. We don't fight them, despite most of their NPCs in the old world being hostile. The blacks are there, too, but I doubt you'd tell Nalice to her face that you just killed Sartharion. There's not even direct explanation why you can simply access the Obsidian Sanctum that easily, and Nalice not complaining. A rather 'simple' explanation would be that the blacks are currently at odds with each other, the followers of Neltharion and the ones who are working for Sintharia (http://www.wowwiki.com/Sintharia) (who, while she was still alive, created the twilight dragons, probably without Neltharion's knowledge), and it's fine with Nalice as a follower of Neltharion that you deal with those rogue black dragons and their creations.<br />
But, big but, there is hardly a way those other portals under the temple will lead to another raid encounter, except maybe, big maybe, another raid on the blues. Though I doubt that, &quot;friendly&quot; blue dragons like Kalecgos and Tyrigosa will probably take over the Blue Dragonflight and end the Nexus War.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Others which just had me dying laughing were:<br />
<br />
- Pets <br />
o Exotic pets have had their health increased slightly. <br />
o Exotic pets can no longer be dodged or parried. Completely contradicts what Blizzard has been saying all along about Exotic Pets not being significantly better than regular pets. Just additional options for BM hunters.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Crusader Strike: Now Instantly causes 125% weapon damage as holy damage and increases all holy damage done to the target by 2% for 6 seconds, stacks up to 5 times.We just got rid of Judgement of the Crusader (and thank god for that!) Why would we want to get it back?<br />
<br />
<br />
- Searing Pain: No longer causes a high amount of threat. Damage increased for all ranks.LOLOLOLOLOLOL<br />
<br />
And these are in addition the the changes quoted by others as being ridiculous, like the change to Chaos Bolt.<br />
<br />
And looking through the list of just class changes, the utter lack of major nerfs to any class is a huge sign of how fake these patch notes are.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chaoslux</div><div class="date">2009-02-01, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bags going from 20-&gt;22 and 22-&gt;24, i would hardly doubt it, because they said the bigger our bags are, the bigger the strain on the server since it need to keep more information, even the currency tab is currently working like an invisible bag since they cannot add all old tokens to it or it would make it too big or something. <br />
<br />
@Potency again: As i stated, that they combine the penetration ratings, i have nothing against that. It's the addition of Haste in it that makes it so weird (as well as the horrible name they gave for it). <br />
Yeah, Haste isnt good for melee and the blues have told us about it, But its currently one of the prime Caster stats, all casters want haste especially in arenas where it affects your GCD. If they were to include Haste into Potency, then you would not only see Arcane Mages shooting 6k instants, but you would see them shooting 6k instants that negates any amounts of Arcane Resist you may stack. So i'm pretty sure when they said they would change haste for melee that it would be something along the lines of better scaling, with possible GCD reduction.<br />
<br />
Also, when they add a new raid that contains a faction, they include a whole new faction for it, they just dont take an existing faction and give it a second purpose.<br />
<br />
They said a new mark turnin quest that requires AV marks would be avaible in 3.1, so there are chances they do indeed add Rep turnin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can some answer me what purpose those profession's bags serve as currently I have no need to &quot;nerf&quot; my general space for whatever items I might pick up and not sold (vendor) it immediately? <br />
<br />
I still believe that Blizz should add one profession slot to carry it around and at least 3 - 4 bank profession slots. <br />
<br />
Haven't Blizz also stated that they will rework ammo pouches/quivers for Hunters. (Probably to give Hunters 1 slot back for &quot;general purpose&quot;.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not so sure if a melee/physical GCD reduction would do that much. Enhancers and retadins already benefit from that reduction, as their 'specials' are spells already (don't know how it affects hunters)<br />
And most physical DDs, except cats and maybe hunters, don't rely on special attacks that much anyway. Rogues, for example, are capped by the energy regeneration, of course haste works towards the several talents to generate energy on hit, but a lowered GCD wouldn't do much. The warriors' rage not that hard-capped, but still similar. Enhancers rely on WF and Static Shock procs, so autohits, benefits from haste of course but GCD reduction doesn't affect this, used abilities like shocks and Stormstrike have a CD. Don't know retadins that much, but I guess it's quite similar.</div></div><hr />

Paladins and Death Knights both rely heavily on special attacks. Neither use terribly many attacks that actually generate anything from haste, Death Knights especially are capped by the rune regeneration of 10s. <br />
<br />
That said, Paladins would probably benefit most if haste affected GCD on everything, while Death Knights would benefit the least (they've got such a haste effect, which is useless because you don't gain anything from it)</div></div><hr />

Here's the thing; very few things in here make sense. The class section betrays a complete failure of understanding of fundamental class mechanics. The warrior section in particular is laughable in every imaginable way and believe me I laughed heartily at it. The rest reads like a QQ'ers wishlist: see removal of brew of the month from meta achievement, and a complete casual mention of allowing full customization of the ui - something which they repeatedly stated they would leave up to the mod designers.<br />
The obvious stuff is ... well obvious. Ulduar. Dual specs. No-brainers really.<br />

Hmmm. 3 weeks for a corporation to compile changes from several different teams for a major content patch just after Christmas/New Years.<br />
<br />
Can I have some of what you're smoking ?* ;D<br />

QFT. Some of these changes are things Blizzard have stated they will never do. Others consitute a patch of an estimated 10GB size. Which would be expanion level changes.<br />

True, but Blizzard rarely makes stupid changes that cater to the players' stupid ideas. The pure mass of those makes this list very fake. A brainstorming list would look different.<br />
