Heart of Fear: Garalon<br />
Tonight we take a look at Garalon, the fourth boss of the Heart of Fear raid.<br />
<br />

<br />
Heart of Fear<br />
The Sha of Fear has corrupted the grand empress of the mantid. Her increasingly erratic and paranoid commands have driven the Klaxxi--the keepers of mantid culture--to take aggressive action. Because they are few in number, the Klaxxi are reluctantly willing to accept outside help in destroying the empress and purging their race of the sha's negative influence.<br />

&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Furious Swipe (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122735) - Garalon performs a Furious Swipe to targets in a large cone in front of him, inflicting 800,000 Physical damage. If Garalon fails to hit at least 2 targets with his Furious Swipe, he gains Fury.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Fury (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122754) - Fury increases Garalon's damage dealt by 10% and movement speed by 10% for 30 sec. This effect stacks.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/deadly.png&quot; title=&quot;Deadly&quot; /&gt; Crush (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122774) - Garalon crushes his foes, inflicting 100,000 Physical damage to all players. Any player within 12 yards receives an additional 800,000 Physical damage as Garalon's body slams down upon them. Garalon's massive bulk also knocks down all players for 2 sec. Garalon crushes foes whenever he detects their presence beneath him. In Normal Difficulty, Garalon also crushes foes when Pheromones passes to a new target. In Heroic Difficulty, Garalon periodically crushes foes.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png&quot; title=&quot;Important&quot; /&gt; Pheromones (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123092) - Garalon surrounds a player with powerful pheromones, fixating on the target. Every 2 sec. the Pheromones inflict 20,000 Nature damage and Pungency on the target, then spawn a Pheromone Trail. Pheromones pass to allies in close proximity.<br />
<br />
Pungency (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123081) - Exposure to Garalon's Pheromones renders the player extra pungent, increasing Pheromone damage by 10% for 1.25 min. This effect stacks.<br />
Pheromone Trail (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123120) - The Pheromone Trail on the ground inflicts 25,000 Nature damage to players within 4 yards.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/dps.png&quot; title=&quot;Dps&quot; /&gt; Garalon's Legs - Players attack Garalon's legs separately from his body.<br />
<br />
Weak Point - Close proximity to Garalon's leg allows attackers to see weak points, increasing their damage dealt to the leg by 100%.<br />
Broken Leg (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122786) - Breaking one of Garalon's legs damages Garalon for 3% of his maximum health and reduces Garalon's movement speed by 15%. This effect stacks up to 4 times.<br />
Mend Leg (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123495) - Garalon periodically mends one of his broken legs, restoring it to full health.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/heroic.png&quot; title=&quot;Heroic&quot; /&gt; Damaged (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/67323) - In Heroic difficulty, Garalon gains the Damaged effect upon reaching 33% remaining health.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png&quot; title=&quot;Important&quot; /&gt; Pheromones (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123092) - While Garalon has the Damaged effect, Garalon ignores the fixate effects of Pheromones.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Melee Attack - While Garalon has the Damaged effect, Garalon uses his normal melee attack and gains a dramatic speed increase.<br />

Beta Class Balance Analysis<br />
One slight correction to something we said a while back:<br />
White attacks are still ‘one roll’ (Miss Dodge Parry Block Glance Crit Hit), and yellow attacks are still ‘two roll’ (Miss Dodge Parry Block, Crit). The only change to that is that Block against players is an additional separate roll now. <br />
Correction: Block is always a separate roll, not just on players. So white attacks are technically two rolls (Miss Dodge Parry Glance Crit Hit vs. Block NonBlock), and yellow attacks are technically three rolls (Miss Dodge Parry Hit vs. Block NonBlock vs. Crit NonCrit). However, please take care in discussing this, since &quot;two roll&quot; has historically meant that crit is rolled separately, which is NOT the case for white attacks.<br />
<br />
From the calculator I'm assuming this [healer pushback] is 70 percent right?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Have you guys done the low level pvp pass that Zarhym mentioned in this thread many months back?<br />
No, not yet. Good question. We like to make sure the changes we have for level 85-90 feel shippable before we look at things at lower level. Any abilities that stand out are certainly worth mentioning (anywhere in this forum) so we will be on the lookout for them.<br />

Continuing on from this post: is Runic Corruption bugged? Some DKs are noticing that multiple procs of Runic Corruption in a row are leading to the buff getting a full 3 seconds added to it. Take an instance of 3 RC procs in a row with a 2.5 second duration. 3 RC procs in a row should grant 7.5 seconds, but in actuality, is giving us 8.5 seconds (2.5 + 3 + 3). Could this bug possibly explain why Runic Corruption is doing so well for the devs and not the players?<br />
Yes, that is exactly what is happening and is fixed for the next build. That should account for some of the difference between RC and RE.<br />
<br />
Is it intended that Rime proc Howling blast doesn't produce 10 Runic power? Also, using conversion while in frost spec/pres causes the RP generation to go from 20% to 100%.<br />
Yes. RP generation is associated with spending runes. We’ve fixed the bug with Conversion interacting incorrectly with Frost Presence for the next build.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman))<br />
Frankly, I don't see buffing Telluric Currents to be the right approach for Shaman mana regeneration<br />
The intent of Telluric Currents is free Lightning Bolts, not a healer mana regeneration system. <br />
<br />
(The new priest talent, PW: Solace is intended to generate mana, but it is a talent that competes against other mana regeneration / conservation talents. Always remember when looking at healer mana that you have to look at the entire package, including the costs of heals themselves.)<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior))<br />
Is it intentional that Bloodbath does not proc off Dragon's Roar?<br />
Yes. We will change the tooltip to clarify that it only affects melee special attacks.<br />
<br />
Is there a chance that it could be tied to both Critical Block chance and Shield Barrier potency so Mastery is relevant to both our AM Buttons, like paladins got with their Bastion of Glory talent? (You could also bring back the &quot;Hold the Line&quot; name this way.)<br />
We think Prot's mastery works. Block chance is still useful since you can't get 100% uptime of Shield Block. Shield Barrier is getting a lot of attention now because it works so well on easier dungeons and older content, but we expect warriors will still be using Shield Block a lot on tougher fights.<br />
<br />
In Fury related news, is there any chance that Raging Blow could be looked at? It's still not very powerful or integral to Fury's rotation and only accounts for a small portion of Fury's overall DPS.<br />
We agree that Raging Blow needs to hit harder. You should be excited about using it whenever it is available.<br />

Content Difficulty and Consumption Speed<br />
If that would be so, then why is TBC considered the best expansion for raiders, even with TK and Sunwell being so hard as they were? Loads of guilds could not complete SW, heck most guilds did not even raid at that level.<br />
For the most hardcore raiders, yeah, sure it was fun. For the players that were somewhere behind (either Tier 5 or Tier 6 content, heck, even at Brutallus), things weren't exactly bright. I still remember the many threads we were seeing back then about Kael'thas and Lady Vashj breaking guilds...<br />
<br />
Kael'thas, Muru, Kil'Jaeden, those fights were so hard they were massive brick walls, yet people liked it that way. And I bet it is because they gave a good challenge to even the most hardcore raiders. Thats what HM bosses should be, and should stay at -&gt; hard, challenging and rewarding fights.<br />
I understand this is the reasoning from the perspective of hardcore players, but there're many more players that for whatever reason don't really have the same level of skill. It doesn't take long for those players to go from fun to the frustration of realizing that, at their current skill level, they're facing an impossible challenge.<br />
<br />
And the rewards have to more then a green &quot;Herioc&quot; tag for killing a nerfed boss. It has to be mostly the feeling that killing that boss really takes effort and the relieve of killing that boss after your 20th+ try on your own skills and not by a 5% debuff crutch must be whats driving you forward. Being rewarded for killing a weaker boss doesn't feel compelling to a lot of people.<br />
To many other players, knowing that the boss is now 5% weaker, is compelling because it means they can have an easier time on things that were blocking them and will start progressing on the encounter.<br />
<br />
So why is blizzard willing to take the achievement and prestige out of heroics. Trying to act like we're just being greedy for wanting heroics to MEAN something to down is pathetic. (which exactly how this blue is sounding)<br />
Achievements aren't being removed from heroics, so that argument is rather moot. But if you really think that John Doe cares about what you did in a video game, you should really think again. Of course it means something to you, just don't pretend it means something for everyone, because that's not the case even in-game.<br />
<br />
If you really think everyone needs to 'have room to move up or they'll get bored and quit' then screw it. Why have content that's hard at all - lets release 20 raid bosses all with a straight 25% nerf straight away so no one gets their feelings hurt that they can't progress.<br />
There's a massive difference between having an appropriate challenge, hitting a brick wall, and steamrolling everything. If there's absolutly no challenge on any of the bosses, that would be as boring as hitting a raid full of Heroic Ragnaros for the players that don't have the skill to perform at that level. There're players that, very probably, could take on even harder incarnations of the bosses we've all seen. There're players that need a 5/10% debuff to have an adequate challenge, and there're players as well that even with the 30% debuff still struggle to advance.<br />
<br />
And all of them are progressing at their own pace.<br />
<br />
But now, all hardcore/semi-hardcore guilds have 8/8 DS HC<br />
Can you prove that with data?. For some reason it's relatively common to have this perception that, because something is easier than before, everyone is getting it, and it's not true. The cold reality is that there're many raiding guilds that won't even see Spine Heroic before Mists of Pandaria is released (the skill difference between those guilds and the Top 200 in the world is THAT big). <br />
<br />
The real funny thing is that if a player couldn't get past a certain hc in TBC he tried harder, joined other groups and got better gear<br />
I know for many hardcore players, changing groups is not only acceptable, but pretty much mandatory. &quot;If your current guild can't clear this, leave that sorry lot behind and aim for the sky&quot;. The reality is that many enjoy raiding with their friends and they'd rather stay there than join a guild that has Madness Heroic on farm status since Day 1, even if they can. <br />
<br />
May I just say, I absolutely love the 3-tier system. The idea is quite brilliant indeed- I just think it needs more tweaking and balancing. That is, at what point to how much HCs should be nerfed, exactly HOW easy LFR should be, and which dungeons should be included- time will tell. My personal belief is that if most of the end content dungeons would be available in the 3 tier system, less people would complain about the &quot;lack of content&quot;.<br />
That's a very interesting thought, thanks for sharing it.<br />
<br />
Are the Challenge Mode dungeons exactly the same as the Heroic Mode counterparts?<br />
Although Jito has already responded to this (here (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4879017939?page=20#399)), I'll add that Challenge mode is actually tuned harder than Heroic, and in some cases there might be even extra pulls or mechanics that aren't present on Heroic. <br />
<br />
I haven't really thought about the jump in the tier gear, e.g from 12 -&gt; 13. Even if the ilevel of the tier is on par with dungeon/rep reward level like I suggested, if the set bonus is more powerful than the previous, then LFR starts to feel more mandatory again. Any ideas on how this could be possibly addressed?<br />
I think we should accept that guilds pushing for world firsts will do anything in their hands to get an edge. And it doesn't sound fair to punish the rest of the playerbase, preventing them from improving the gear of their characters, just because some guilds might get and edge on their race to world first.<br />
<br />
You are basically saying that when confronted with a challenge the player must receive help to push past it.<br />
Some players do need that help to progress on certain encounters. It's not necessarily a must, but it's true that there're players out there that wouldn't be able to kill a certain boss before the debuff reaches a certain percentage (if you kill a boss just with 5%, then you were pretty close already, by all means).<br />
<br />
The &lt;must&gt; part terrifies me. In terms of player satisfaction your keyword is &quot;progression&quot;, my keyword is &quot;challenge&quot;. Sorry, seems we're worlds apart<br />
Both of them are the same. Progression brings a new challenge to overcome (unless you're at the end of the road). I'd say many players raid for the challenge and the experience, because they expect to overcome it eventually. That's were the line between progression and challenge might become distorted, as you start going through the different levels of skill our players have. <br />
<br />
While to you a boss that is now 20% weaker than it was back then might look as an absolute non-challenge, the truth is that is still challenging for the players that are now progressing on it. So, the &quot;challenge&quot; is still there, and that's why, in that sense, for those players the debuff is almost a &quot;must&quot;. If it wasn't for it, they wouldn't have anything else to do after defeating what's available to their own level of skill. <br />
<br />
I am well aware that I am a tiny insignificant player compared to the millions playing wow; I am only trying to provide my own feedback which I believe is both my duty and right as a customer, as insignificant as I may be.<br />
If you can put your thoughts in a clear and concise manner (which you clearly do), then it's not insignificant. We may agree or disagree, but that's it. <br />
<br />
How then can you, Draztal, assume that you know that &quot;many other players&quot; see nerfs as compelling because they now have an easier time? That's just an assumption as well isn't it?<br />
It's as much of an assumption as it is saying that many hardcore raiders find super difficult bosses compelling. I mean, it's just my way of trying to put into words that there's a segment of players that like the fact that, eventually, that boss they can't even think of killing right now, will be weaker enough to consider attempting it, and perhaps, succeeding at overcoming it. <br />
<br />
I'd be crazy to not say that there are many hardcore raiders that find compelling fighting bosses that are absolutely insane for a huge majority of players.<br />
<br />
You immediately solve all the issues. The people who need the nerfs, can still see the content, but get lower ilevel gear and the hardcores can play without nerfs to get their epeen gear.<br />
So that those players can artificially feel superior to them? Isn't enough the fact that they defeated the boss without the debuff prove they're already better than them?<br />
<br />
I don't understand why this can't be implemented like this? I don't think a player that performs less should get the same rewards as a daily theorycrafting elite player. We don't pay a cleaner the same amount as a surgeon.<br />
This is a videogame, not a job. So it's pretty hard to relate that example to this environment, honestly. <br />
<br />
Even if it was mandatory that you raid T11 content first, then T12 before you can get to T13, a lot of servers would only have one raiding guild running T13 content and wouldn't let anyone without T12 gear in.<br />
This was happening back on the TBC days (I'll use it since it's been mentioned several times as the ideal &quot;moment&quot; of hardcore raiding). At some point through the BT/Hyjal/SWP cycle, in some realms guilds just started canibalizing each other, as the rest of the players just didn't have the gear, or the progression required to join them. Some guilds broke trying to defeat Brutallus, but I've always wondered how many players trying to enter those guilds, were rejected solely on the gear they had, rather than the actual skill they had, just because they were still playing catch-up to the players that had progressed more than them.<br />
<br />
Draztal, don't you think it's a bit of a concern to sort of set the barrier really low in some things, however? I mean, I totally get the whole being accessible (I hate the word though XD) and as you can tell from my raid history I am one of those that come from a 'I used to raid but got tired of the schedules&quot;-people for which LFR is excellent, and to a lesser degree normal mode.<br />
<br />
However, I am greatly concerned where we are headed in general with gaming, into what seems like an environment where difficulty is not allowed to exist without a free pass, and learning curves is to be frowned upon. Failure is not an option - more or less. Don't you (and others here) feel that it's bad for both the longevity of the game, the sense of accomplishment that arises from solving things, and just general patience with the few things that should be hard will wane through this encouragement?<br />
No, I don't think there's any concern on setting the barrier too low. I mean, anyone can play basketball, yet I know that the only thing in common I have with Michael Jordan when it comes to basketball skills is that he's also a human being. <br />
<br />
Gaming has constantly been evolving, and it'll continue to do so for as long as this industry keeps moving. Difficulty is there, but the industry is probably moving away from punishing the players for things that, in the past, were seen as normal. Heck, back in the days even &quot;casual&quot; games (such as Super Mario) were punishing enough that, if you lost all your lifes (basically, the attempts at finishing the game), you had to start from scratch back in World 1-1.<br />
<br />
Now - what can we do for Draztal. Oh yeah lets nerf the height of the hoop and the length of the field to Draztal also can get the above achievements - after all Jordan wont mind - he got them first and had fun doing them.<br />
The proper equivalent to your comparison would be that, for Jordan's despair, I'd have fun playing with my friends and perhaps even winning local tournaments (thanks to them, not me, certainly). But, anyways, you're comparing the professional aspect of something anyone can do (play basketball) with a videogame. The differences in that regard, are, obviously, too big to even consider it a fair ground. <br />
<br />
Anyways, let's leave that example up there, would be a shame if the thread went off-topic now when there're so many interesting posts going around. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/228883-we-consume-content-too-fast/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4879017939?page=28#558))<br />

Cataclysm Wasn't Entirely Bad After All<br />
When we were leaving behind The Burning Crusade the general consesus from players in the forums was something like... &quot;This is the worst expansion ever, can't wait for Wrath of the Lich King&quot;.<br />
<br />
When we were leaving behind Wrath of the Lich King the general consesus from players in the forums was something like... &quot;This is the worst expansion ever, can't wait for Cataclysm&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now that we'll leave behind Cataclysm the general consesus from players in the forums, once again, is... &quot;This is the worst expansion ever, can't wait for Mists of Pandaria&quot;. <br />
<br />
Yet, so far, every expansion has added something positive to the game (of course, some players will say TBC was the best, some will say Wrath was the best, and so on). <br />
<br />
Both Archeology, Transmogrification and Raid Finder have been some of the best additions in the game. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/229094-you-know-cata-was-not-entirely-bad-after-all/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4902590374?page=2#33))<br />
<br />
Please Bring Back Attunements<br />
However, my guess is that some people probably don't miss the need to do some ridiculously long questchain just to get access to the newest raid, but many might just miss the quests itself. Thus my idea, why not add those quest chains back in, as optional quests, letting them tell the story and/or reason you have to do the stuff in that raid, maybe add in some kind of reward or even a final quest for the final boss... that would be nice (as an example: i really like the black temple access quest chain, the way it is nowadays)<br />
The Lorewalkers faction should prove very interesting for all those of you that enjoy discovering the lore of Azeroth. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/228882-please-bring-back-attunements/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4849015040?page=18#356))<br />

Within the last week there has been a great deal of discussion about Diablo III's end-game. Blizzard even agree's that there is a current lacking of a long-term end-game. There have been many different suggestions for an end-game, such as those from Kripp and Athene, as well as Sixen's recent video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZOzStdC9fA) suggesting the return of Pandemonium Events. <br />

<br />
I would not know but from what can tell in LFR you get Siege of Wyrmrest Temple for killing the first 4 bosses and Fall of Deathwing for downing the last 4 and that's it. Normal you get Destroyer's End with said title at the end, and as you know in Heroic mode you get an achievement for killing each boss and Savior of Azeroth for downing H Madness.<br />
<br />
The idea of a set of achievements for using the debuff would be a good idea, it would then make the hard core players feel cool that they did it the hard way set and be different and the others could then strive for that or get the debuff achievements at least they get something from it. And you could go so far as to be able to get both sets of achievements.<br />

So before you condemn Blizzard of suddenly &quot;reusing&quot; all of their models, look at their track record. This is not something new. What IS new is that people have taken to bitching about it. No one cared back in Burning Crusade when they blatantly reused VANILLA models for bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do have a little difficulty understanding the thought process on that. I see it as:<br />
<br />
LFR: Casuals<br />
Normal: Casuals/&quot;friends&quot; guilds<br />
HC: raiding guilds from good &quot;friends&quot; based guilds up to the hardcore<br />
<br />
The raiding guilds will keep at it and slowly gear up their people and progress. I really don't think significant nerfs are needed. With the system they have they have 3 dials they can tweak to keep each player base happy, i'm not sure why they want to focus on keeping he lowest group happy.</div></div><hr />

What MMO doesn't reuse/reskin existing content? Its not hard to realize that you can't make unique skeletons for every boss in a game as big as a major MMO, it just takes too much time and other resources.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure who they are trying to score with, but it's not working for me. If they're trying to be funny, I'm sure there are better ways than displaying the reporter in bad freeze frames. They sometimes look as if they want to hug or kiss the viewer (see http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2821-Account-Wide-Mounts-Challenge-Mode-Valor-Rewards-Heroic-Scholomance-Blue-Posts), making me believe they do that just to appeal to the male audience (desperate much?).<br />
<br />
If Curse wants to be funny, how about displaying that by having witty lines, instead of showing their reporter in sometimes-suggestive poses? <br />
I understand that they want to do a semi-professional news report about MMO stuff going on. Freeze frames like these remind me of cheap programmes that are supposedly being aired well into the night, out of kids' reach, hurting how much credibility I associate with the reporter. (Edit: Guess others have noticed it too: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJgpj-W7NGE)<br />
<br />
<br />
But who knows, Curse knows their view numbers. Maybe I'm the exception, and it's working extremely well for everyone else, who is just desperately yearning to see this gal in other bad freeze-frames. In that case, keep going where the money is? :3</div></div><hr />

I consider myself casual and hearing his assumptions about what casual players want makes me very worried about where WoW raiding is going.<br />
<br />
To put my opinions simply, progressing through multiple tiers of raids and not seeing the last 1 or 2 &gt; seeing only the end-of-expansion raid and not seeing the first few.<br />
<br />
It's simple, really, and I know most players I talk to IRL (also casual, I know one or two hardcore players though) all agree that this model is far superior, and is also why BC is considered the best by many and why the game suddenly felt like it was going downhill after the tier-skipping was introduced with ToC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both Archeology, Transmogrification and Raid Finder have been some of the best additions in the game. (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)<br />
<br />
hahaha what</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">YankeePhan1234</div><div class="date">2012-07-07, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like how blizzard still thinks archaeology was a success, personally I don't know a single person in game atm that even does it, its just boring and the only thing you really get out of it is vanity items or achievements.<br />
<br />
Also the tidbit about how all semi-hardcore/hardcore guilds aren't 8/8, according to Wowprogress atm there is a total of 6767 guilds worldwide that have killed Heroic Madness (10.51% of all active guilds) and 7947 kills of Heroic Spine (12.35% of all active guilds), with a debuff in a little over 7 months, while in over a YEAR a total of 5954 (8.60% of all active guilds) have killed heroic Ragnaros. And it's only going to get worse, I wouldn't be surprised if the number of guilds that have killed Heroic Madness gets close to 20% by the time mop hits. <br />
<br />
What I'm getting at is that the instance was too quickly ramped down, the gap in guilds that have killed Heroic Madness and those that haven't now a days isn't as dramatic as it was in tier 12, most of the time the only limiting factor for most players is just the time they have to spend raiding to complete the encounter.</div></div><hr />

So before you condemn Blizzard of suddenly &quot;reusing&quot; all of their models, look at their track record. This is not something new. What IS new is that people have taken to bitching about it. No one cared back in Burning Crusade when they blatantly reused VANILLA models for bosses.<br />
<br />

It always seemed to me that Hardmodes were implemented so that a 'challenging' would remain, while Normal Modes would exist so people could see the content and not be frustrated with extremely difficult End Game encounters. Add in LFR, and this opens an even bigger window of opportunity to keep Hard Modes grueling while Normal Modes can stay challenging, since people can &quot;see the content&quot; and play at their level of skill.<br />
<br />
But it is clear they want everyone to have access to Hard Modes, which begs the question of... what is the point? By gradually nerfing the hardest current content, you're going to, without exception, make the game boring and without challenge. I will never understand why you need multiple levels of difficulty if they're all easy. And in terms of metrics, which he makes a point to bring up, there are at least 6500 guilds that are 8/8 hardmode DS currently. I didn't keep digging on Wowprogress, its probably a much higher number than that. This is probably unprecedented for this stage of the tier. That sort of means there is nothing in the game right now that is extremely difficult. Sure, pugs may struggle, but should that really be our bar of quality (I have multiple toons with 6+ hard modes from pugs).</div></div><hr />

Relatively speaking, none of the fights mentioned there even had normal modes. They were tuned like heroics.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree, it's about time they start telling them how it is. Always tired of seeing them crying as if they are entitled to the entire game and nobody is permitted to do anything for fear of stepping on their precious little toes.</div></div><hr />

There's a good few on my server that still do archaeology, but yes mainly for the item/achievement rewards. I haven't worked on mine since it's so grindy that I just haven't had the time to do it lately. I do want the items and achievements because I'm something of a completionist, but...!<br />
<br />
They should significantly decrease the size of the dig site area, add a blacklist, decrease the number of fragments required or increase the amount obtained, introduce an ICD for arch items so you don't get the same one 8 times in a row, increase the chance to obtain a keystone, and incorporate the addon features of Archy and Homing Digeon. Just adding a way to randomly &quot;reset&quot; your dig sites in Mists of Pandaria is nowhere near enough to deal with the problems of this secondary profession.</div></div><hr />

Regardless, I'm happy to see Blizzard has their head on straight this time around. They aren't listening to the crybabies and doing the things that make the average player happy. (you know.. the ones with friends who likes to raid with friends, instead of focusing strictly on gear). Besides, even if Blizzard listens to the crybabies complaining about difficulty.. they'll just complain about something else anyway. Hardcore wow players just aren't worth trying to make happy anymore.<br />
<br />
Blizzard seems to be on the right track with this expansion. Not holding my hopes up yet though. :)</div></div><hr />

Why is that not the default position, instead of &quot;Well, I want to play with my friends, but I don't want to have to sacrifice/pay attention/learn my class to get better, better nerf everything&quot;? As long as heroic modes can be done where people can play the class they want instead of having to play a certain class for a specific function, that's all that's needed (which is why H-spine needed tendon hp nerfs, and the rest of the instance needed no nerf at all).<br />
<br />
I seriously thought they made the normal/heroic distinction in the first place so they could make balls-tough heroic modes for those of us who wanted it.<br />
<br />
P.S. I raid with my friends and am in a U.S. top 200 8/8H group. We were top 125 t12. My friends (and I) are good (but obviously not the best in the world level). Were they always? Meh, maybe not, but they practiced, got better, and now we own faces. It's not like heroic modes are impossible to begin with except for some elite people. We're all working professionals, some of us married, some with kids, and we only raid max 12 hours a week, even during progression. Come on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crispin</div><div class="date">2012-07-08, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh, reading those blue responses was absolutely painful. I consider myself casual and hearing his assumptions about what casual players want makes me very worried about where WoW raiding is going.<br />
<br />
To put my opinions simply, progressing through multiple tiers of raids and not seeing the last 1 or 2 &gt; seeing only the end-of-expansion raid and not seeing the first few.<br />
<br />
It's simple, really, and I know most players I talk to IRL (also casual, I know one or two hardcore players though) all agree that this model is far superior, and is also why BC is considered the best by many and why the game suddenly felt like it was going downhill after the tier-skipping was introduced with ToC.<br />
<br />
The questions were just as bad tbh.<br />
<br />
It's all summed up to (I want other players to envy my gear and skill!!)<br />
<br />
<br />
In the end, this is a game, and that's just it, there are plenty of challenges in life, if WoW doesnt provide one that's big enough for hardcore raiders, honestly, it's like racing drivers asking Audi to make their cars drive like Le Mans cars, why would they cut of the majority of their customers for a few?<br />
<br />
The sooner hardcore raiders realise, that Blizzard needs to make as big a profit as possible, the sooner they'll realise that things won't get reverted to TBC standards.<br />
<br />
Was cockblocking raids in BWL fun? no I hated it, was a extremely overtuned C'thun fun? no, every single raid group who couldnt kill it because it was unkillable went nuts about it, Death and Taxes pretty much doomed WoW because of it, players hated how the original 4 horsemen required as many geared tanks as it did, etc. etc. etc.<br />
<br />
I don't blame Blizzard, when they make an encounter overtuned or put up strcit requirements, which the top world guilds cant overcome (hello Yogg 0 keepers) and said guilds go nuts about how it's impossible to do it, untill some Asian guild figures it out and gets it done.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are damned if they do, and damned if they don't, so the obvious choice is to satisfy the customers who doesnt care about overtuned encounters.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pacster</div><div class="date">2012-07-08, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, TBC really broke many guilds. It sucks if you are in one of the leading guilds on your server, equip your maintank in 2 months and when he is geared up he says &quot;I don't feel like raiding Kara and Gruul another 2 months so the rest of the raid can get the best equippment...I rather try my luck with one of the top20 guilds in the world&quot;. Suddenly we had problems to clear kara after that...and that lead to a huge amount of frustration.<br />
<br />
But unlike Blizz claims it was not just brickwall encounters but a huge amount of bugs that made those boss encounters really annoying. Wether you have been the first one on your server to down Gruul(which was basicly the first real brickwall in TBC because of enrage timer) was for example only a question wether his earthquake slam was buggy or not.<br />
<br />
I think the big problem is not the difficulty of a fight. I think it's more that you got to kill the same 7 bosses each week before you get to the encounter you want. That you have to kill 150 bosses before you have the equippment to get a serious shot at the next goal. I always hated to have to be fully concentrated on a fight that I beat about 15 times already...but wipe again because someone makes a small mistake. You essentially spent 10 hours a week fully concentrated on something that bored the **** out of you(and some more on farming pots etc.)....just to get to that ONE encounter. For me that was a motivation problem then. <br />
<br />
If it's just about not breaking guilds like in TBC then there are several solutions(some already in the game):<br />
-prolonged IDs<br />
-no enrage timers or other boss mechanics that force guilds to have a certain equippment...or making sure that the earlier bosses drop that many that you don't have to farm them for months just to get the right level.<br />
-discouraging guild-hopping. For example by punishing guild hoppers. Let only players engange in high end boss encounters that are exalted with their guild...or give guild-members of level 25 guilds(and all high end guilds are on that level) with exalted status a serious buff on certain boss encounters.<br />
-have more drops in general(cause loot distribution and frustration has always been a problem with guilds)<br />
<br />
Blizz has to balance between guilds and LFR. LFR encounters should just be about having a certain level of gear(and you shouldn't get around that with pvp-gear) and not much teamplay. Guild encounters on the other hand should just be about skill, teamplay and movement and not so much about item-level.</div></div><hr />

I think the older gamers that actually want players to have to work at something and really earn it are getting screwed by the entitled generation not only taking over as gaming consumers but as the developers as well. They just don't seem to get the basic concept that hand holding players through content makes the game worse for everyone. When you have LFR, and normal, there's just no reason to ever nerf heroic content unless it's badly tuned. A goal of 100% of the active playerbase downing all heroic bosses is just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely hilarious. Keep on aiming for the Farmville audience, Blizzard, I'm sure they're just lining up in droves to pay over $100 to get access to MoP, managing to play it on their ancient 2006 era XP/Vista machine, leveling up to 90 then playing a singleplayer version of it instead of just going to facebook.com.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to defend zynga's profit model... but farmville is actually more taxing on performance than WoW is. Any machine that can run it can easily run WoW. But hey, when MoP adds farming to WoW it won't really matter anyways...<br />

In Burning Crusade, my guild never cleared Sunwell, but I still found it to be one of the most rewarding and challenging expansions for raid content to date. I don't think hardcore raid mentality has anything to do with it - it's really just a matter of players who want to work hard and better their game instead of being handed things on a silver platter. Where is the fun in that :/ I think Heroic modes should be left alone - if you want to nerf the hell out of normal mode so players can see the CONTENT then go ahead, but Heroic modes should really be indicative of their name.</div></div><hr />
