So ... What's the problem ? These changes were in the presumed fake patch notes, with the exact same name for each card. How could someone get this kind of informations 3 days before it's officialy posted ? <br />
One thing is sure, it doesn't look that fake anymore and they're worth posting. <br />
<br />
Anyway before reading the notes, don't forget to check the other important post of the day (readding it because it spent less than an hour at the top of this page.)<br />

Herbalism: The chances to find a Fel Lotus while picking an herb have been increased.<br />

These notes are by no way official, trust them if you want to. The only thing making them credible is the source (http://pastey.net/11284) containing informations 3 days before they were official.<br />
<br />
Should be released shortly but a few of the changes but several changes involving all classes that aren't including in this list (as well more for those in the list). Also most changes are paraphrased <br />
