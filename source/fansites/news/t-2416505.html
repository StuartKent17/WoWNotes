War of Thorns Chapter 2<br />
Spoilers ahead! The War of Thorns (https://wow.gamepedia.com/War_of_the_Thorns) quest chain that leads up to the Burning of Teldrassil continues today!<br />
<br />
<br />
The time gate from last week has been lifted and you can now experience the rest of the Burning of Teldrassil story.<br />
The second half involves Saurfang and his troops taking Lor'danel by surprise while the Alliance tries to stop them. It eventually culminates in Malfurion facing off against Sylvanas and Saurfang interfering. In the end, the tree is left burning and the Alliance players must help evacuate Darnassus.<br />
There is a cinematic that will show at the end of the quest chain.<br />
Alliance players will be rewarded with the Smoldering Reins of the Teldrassil Hippogryph (https://beta.wowdb.com/items/163127-smoldering-reins-of-the-teldrassil-hippogryph) while the Horde receives the War-Torn Reins of the Undercity Plaguebat (https://beta.wowdb.com/items/163128-war-torn-reins-of-the-undercity-plaguebat) for completing the entire quest chain.<br />
Stormwind Harbor will now be updated with Darnassian and Gilnean refugees. If a player completes the quest chain Darkshore will also change to have Teldrassil burning in the distance with smoke and ash effects.<br />
<br />

Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl Micro-Holidaykttc<br />
The Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl (http://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/646-kirin-tor-tavern-crawl) is going on all day today. It is a micro-holiday that sends players to different taverns around the world. <br />
<br />
<br />
You can join the currently active tavern from a new NPC in Dalaran (Tipsi Wobblerune (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119045-tipsi-wobblerune) or Anebria Sunwine (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119088-anebria-sunwine))<br />
After some time the group moves along to the next Tavern. You can press the last call button or take the portal to move on.<br />
If you get left behind on the tavern tour, you can catch up by speaking to the mage in the current tavern you are in. <br />
Each location has drink and food that you can interact with. The food will grant a well fed buff.<br />
There are also additional NPCs in each tavern enjoying the holiday.<br />
You can click on the discarded packages to apply one of many unique hat models for four hours. <br />
<br />
