Patch 6.2 - Warlock Demon Models<br />
It looks like Warlocks will be getting the updated versions of the demon models we posted yesterday (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4914-Patch-6-2-Demon-Models-Flying-Feedback-Blue-Posts-Vanilla-Servers-DLC-490), as well as the Voidlord (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/voidlord2.jpg). Keep in mind that the creature that looks similar to a Felhunter in that post is not actually a Felhunter. <br />

Upcoming Live Q&amp;A with Ion Hazzikostas<br />
On Saturday, June 6th, at 2:00 PM Pacific time, I'll be sitting down with Lead Game Designer Ion &quot;Watcher&quot; Hazzikostas to answer your questions about Warlords of Draenor -- including the upcoming 6.2 Content Patch, as well as lessons we've learned throughout Warlords of Draenor's development.<br />
<br />
We'll be sharing more information, including how to submit your questions, in a full announcement on Monday, but wanted to give the community as much advance notice as possible regarding the date and time of this upcoming Q&amp;A. We'll see you there!<br />
<br />
The question is will he be answering real questions or just give us more fluff as usual?<br />
If Tough Questions doesn't mean actual Tough Questions, you have every right to yell at me on twitter/IRL. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/603365165036392448))<br />
Appreciate the response. I really hope we can get some clarity. Lots of trust lost recently by the fans. Makes me sad, really.<br />
Really it's not for a lack of not hearing you. Flight, endgame content, getting out of garrisons, pvp, all good feedback. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/603366951130378240))<br />
<br />
&quot;Tough&quot; pre-approved questions. Give me, and the player base a break. It's all a PR stunt.<br />
Lots of people have lots of legitimate questions about 6.2 &amp; we'd like to spend some time addressing them. (CM_Zarhym (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/603353888083804161))<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Flying Feedback<br />
Thanks everyone for your continued feedback and discussion on the topic. The development team is actively reading it and discussing it, and will certainly continue to in the days ahead. Weâ€™re all as passionate about working on WoW as we are playing it, and we're dedicated to making it a great experience. As always, we'll let you know if we have any further information to share. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/374447-watcher-says-no-flying-in-wows-future-iv/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17605632090?page=17#331))<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
@WarcraftDevs and Lack of Developer Communication<br />
the really heartbreaking thing for me is the silence. Pre-WOD etc were talking to us and engaging us.<br />
I know it's difficult when you don't receive direct responses, but trust that we do hear your feedback. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/600456565527687168))<br />
And trust that we recognize when systems that we've developed are weak or unfruitful. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/600456687271550976))<br />
We're just as interested in providing you a wealth of enjoyable content as you are in having it. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/600458762881642496))<br />
We continue to recommend because it acts as a single source of feedback for all WoW Devs. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/600458816572948481))<br />
Routing through the single outlet keeps information less fragmented and more open to the entire community. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/600458957774163970))<br />
That being said, thank you! We greatly appreciate all the passionate feedback. It's very important to us. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/600459000094658560))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
that weapon even though casters can obtain a 710 (example) from Archimonde? Is this correct?<br />
Typically, soon after a caster gets a 705 from Normal Archimonde, a shaman will have access to a 705 from Heroic Kormrok. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601103690234138624))<br />
<br />
Concern rewarding the ilvl rampup in HFC: wont the loot from the first bosses become obsolete when the raid is on farm?<br />
Weâ€™re adding quests to unlock shortcuts that will allow raids to skip ahead if desired once theyâ€™ve cleared a few times. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601104491354525697))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
hi, will the Ironhoof Destroyer mount still drop (100% drop rate) from blackhand mythic when Patch 6.2 goes live?<br />
Yes. We typically wait to reduce end-boss mount drop rates until a new expansion arrives. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/600839719677657088))<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
Will ilevels in mythic be scaled down like challenge mode dungeons are?<br />
No, all your items will work as they would anywhere else. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/600839849143177217))<br />
<br />
It seems that mythic dungeon bosses can be bonus-rollable, can't they? If yes, with the new coin or the old one?<br />
Yes. The new Seals of Inevitable Fate will allow for bonus rolls on Mythic dungeon bosses. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601103262415073280))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
I still have a blue +10 frost resist cloak from when Lokholar dropped loot on like week 1 #LFGKorrak #AlteracValley #He'sEvadingAgain (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/600563390323564545))<br />
I thought I was crazy for thinking AV used to drop loot back in the day!<br />
Guess what is a bad idea? Incentivizing your opponent to kill you to make big bosses you can loot #EmergentGameplay (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/600564115426381824))<br />
I prefer that design to the one incentivizing your opponent to actively avoid you <br />
Not going to disagree with you, I miss the 24-hour battles sometimes. Did you like WG/TB/Ashran better? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/600565501727789056))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
With loot scaling with progress, will the garrison cache also limit to the next boss only? #Warcraft<br />
No, the mission cache can contain items from any boss in that difficulty. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/601109297716572160))<br />

&lt;/div&gt; When negative behavior occurs, we know that the faster a player receives feedback, the better their chances of reforming. With that in mind, weâ€™re building and iterating on a new instant feedback system that delivers actionable feedback and appropriate punishment to players that need it most. In the future, we expect instant feedback to take on rewards as well, but in step one weâ€™re focused on reform-oriented feedback and punishment.<br />
<br />
The systemâ€™s initial tests kick off today in NA and take aim at verbal harassment. The system delivers reform cards (notifications that link evidence of negative behavior with the appropriate punishment) that help players address their negative behavior. Your reports help the instant feedback system understand and punish the kind of verbal harassment the community actively rejects: homophobia, racism, sexism, death threats, and other forms of excessive abuse. These harmful communications will be punished with two-week or permanent bans within fifteen minutes of gameâ€™s end. Hereâ€™s how it works:<br />
<br />
<br />
Teammates or opponents of the offending player send reports and the system validates them to make sure they arenâ€™t false<br />
The system examines the case and determines whether the behavior deserves rejection or punishment based on community-driven standards of behavior<br />
The system fires a reform card through email, sharing the chat log of the offending player (we scrub other playersâ€™ names and chat logs) and the punishment for the behavior<br />
<br />
<br />
The player behavior team will be on deck, hand-reviewing the first few thousand cases the instant feedback system sorts through. If the test goes smoothly, we expect instant feedback to roll out to all regions shortly. Like we mentioned up top, this test marks the beginning for instant feedback. Upgrades will allow it to shoulder more reform and punishment responsibilities and even reward positive play. Hereâ€™s a peek at where weâ€™re headed:<br />
<br />
<br />
In-client reform cards<br />
Follow-up notifications for players who reported a player who was punished<br />
Upgrades for chat and ranked restrictions<br />
Upgrades to recognize negative gameplay behaviors like intentional feeding<br />
Recognition of honors and rewards for positive behaviors and communication<br />
<br />
<br />
Weâ€™ll hang around the comments to answer questions and hear your feedback. Weâ€™ll come back soon to share more about the vision for player behavior, including plans for the Tribunal.<br />
<br />
I really think this is going down the wrong path. Having it weight the words said differently isn't a positive feature. Vocabulary doesn't efficiently correlate to negativity, and often the most innocuous words are the most negative. Gg easy is far more infuriating and negative than getting called a fag ever was. I hope efforts are put forth to try and actually curb negative behavior, not just try and punish people for saying naughty words. We're not children here. Remove the afks, the feeders, and the incessant negative players. Don't try and police language.<br />
The system does not just look at words, and tries to learn phrases. In fact, &quot;gg easy&quot; is considered a very negative phrase by the system today.<br />
<br />
Secondly, we do have testing in place for the system to identify and punish intentional feeders and other forms of gameplay toxicity.<br />
<br />
Lyte how do you plan on solving False Positives? Especially when it's done automatically, and within 15 minutes of a game ending, there are sure to be issues. Do you have a certain criteria that they need to fill to get automatically banned/perma-banned? <br />
The system analyzes in-game data like chat logs, and then assesses reports and tries to &quot;validate&quot; the reports. In addition, every report and honor in the game is teaching the system about behaviors and what looks OK or not OK, so the system continuously learns over time. If a player shows excessive hate speech (homophobia, sexism, racism, death threats, so on) the system might hand out a permanent ban to the player for just 1 game. But, this is pretty rare!<br />
<br />
In terms of false positives, we recently flew in Player Support and Player Behavior team members from all around the world to hand-review thousands of chat logs, and we saw false positive rates in the 1 in 6000 range. So, we know the system isn't perfect, but we think the accuracy is good enough to launch.<br />
&lt;/div&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, so instead of 5... I can do.. 20? Why not an entire stack of 200?<br />
<br />
If I want 150 instead of 200 I simply separate it to 50/150 and mill the 150.<br />
<br />
This is.. hilariously stupid.<br />
<br />
I lack faith we'll have a sincere Q&amp;A more than what's already been said with the &quot;too long; didn't read&quot; of it being: Suck it up, we decided. We read the words you wrote and you should be grateful we did that! But we chose the opposite! Of that.. and pretty much most other things. So, yeah, next question? Nothing? No. Sweet!<br />
<br />
I'll be impressed if they gave honest and sincere answers but in all actuality I'm expecting to be laughing at the Q2 &amp; Q3 numbers for their arrogance but hey -- that's what Ghostralwer wanted. Arrogant narrow minded people. And this is the cost. He wasn't humbled in Cata when people spoke with their wallets. He just rephrased it to &quot;episodic&quot; and it's kind of like that now. No, it's not always been like that. It was like that starting Cata. Until Cata numbers were *climbing* not ebbing and flowing at the rates we see. But.. shareholders and all that jazz. <br />
<br />
And for LoL -- I tried. The *game* occasionally wouldn't connect and I'd get the AFK'er / quitter thing. EVERYTHING ELSE within LoL worked just fine. They were HAPPY to take my money and get new chars. Mysteriously when it came to the *game* those servers weren't nearly as reliable. So I quit it. I tried Blizzards HotS and it's *significantly* more reliable but I just don't like the characters as much. So no real MOBA's for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We read the words you wrote and you should be grateful we did that! But we chose the opposite!<br />
<br />
And that choice probably made a lot of other people happy because it agreed with their views. And then changes which make you happy, probably annoy the hell out of other sections of the playerbase. Theres millions of people who play this game all with their own opinions of what the 'best' direction for it to go in is and the majority isn't determined by who yells the loudest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Nonsense. There have been plenty of interviews where they asked legit questions and Blizzard employees avoided talking about the real problems.<br />
Also real questions and constructive discussions on the forums just get ignored. There are some really great constructive and thought out threads where real issues get mentioned and even solutions are offered which they never really reply to other than &quot;thanks for your feedback&quot; while they do go out of their way to respond to ridiculous questions some frustrated player posted out of the blue (which ends up on MMO-Champion and is probably the only thing the majority reads). They don't reply to those threads because then they eventually have to talk about the truth they don't want people to hear because it's bad for business, like them changing the game because it's good for revenue. It has absolutely nothing to do with people not wanting to hear the truth...<br />
<br />
<br />
hostile opinions phrased as questions like &quot;So what changes are you going to make to save the game now that you've totally ruined it with WoD?&quot; <br />
<br />
I don't believe anyone ever asked that in an interview.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, so instead of 5... I can do.. 20? Why not an entire stack of 200?<br />
<br />
The really import change here is that you can cast it out of the craft panel, so you can just queue up 10 casts of it and it will cast them, you do not need to click the stack 10 times like you did with the old one. Using that method, it could be 1 herb at a time for all I care, as long as I can queue up as many as I have available and have it auto-cast them all!</div></div><hr />

Or just click &quot;create all&quot; and turn your back on the computer/minimize the game until it's all done?<br />
<br />
And this isn't a &quot;change&quot;. If you prefer it, mill the old way. These are Inscription recipes, not a mandatory change to the Milling ability.<br />

Yes, I hope this works so other devs can follow. I donÂ´t play LoL but my kids do and thankfully they have developed rather thick skins so they donÂ´t care that much. I have to monitor my youngest though since heÂ´s prone to blurt out stupid shit at times. This might help when heÂ´s at his mom and I canÂ´t actively monitor his activities.</div></div><hr />

to me, this is what happened to WoW... people complain and complain and Blizzard rushes to cater to them, yet they are never grateful, they still complain until everything is handed to them or dumbed down so they can follow it. then they still complain. instant gratification is a disease.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Giving players the ability to just blanket shut down ally chat when joining a match is an okay temporary measure, but the problem is that so many people have been abused already (and the game is still in beta) that a lot of people are turning chat off for good. Makes coordination in matches much harder, because when you turn off your chat, you're ignoring the good team players as well as the jerks.<br />
<br />
So... I am hoping that Blizzard will build something similar, and that the LoL team will share information on what they've built with other gaming companies because sometimes, going open source on something that protects the gaming community as a whole is the right thing to do.</div></div><hr />

Like they make flyable the BC-azeroth zones... But the truth is they do nothing nowadays.<br />

The worst part of the fly remove (why I have to cancel my account) is it feels like I dropped out so much money on these expansions and for what?<br />
I will never get those back. :(</div></div><hr />

Bear, cat, and ground travel are the only ones that got an update.<br />

<br />
Because it's not a warlock pet update. It's adding a bunch of new NPC models for the burning legion related antics of 6.2 and beyond - warlocks just get it as a byproduct, unless there's a moonkin themed expansion coming up then druids have no reason to get grumpy about warlocks getting some leftovers from a content patch everyone will be playing. <br />
New pet models have also been getting requested and giving vague promises since TBC introduced a lot of new demon models and this isn't a full revamp either, Succubus probably needs an upgrade the most and that's notably left out.</div></div><hr />

Technically Grimoire of Supremacy allows us to summon alternate models of existing creatures (Imp, Voidlord, Abyssal, Terrorguard) but yeah they're still not a big improvement over the original models either.. plus requiring a talent is kind of lame</div></div><hr />

Rushes to cater them?? Do you remember how long SoO lasted, in a time they claimed that their team was bigger than ever? The most popular defense on the forums was &quot;id rather they take this long if it means getting the next expansion perfect&quot;, and how did that work out for us? Even in WoD we have a major content patch that flipped a switch on a raid already in place and added next to nothing besides that. <br />

They know what they're doing, sure, but when the subs drop by a large amount followed almost immediately after by a huge banwave that knocked out 100,000+ of their most loyal customers (does anyone have an actual number? 100,000+ could mean 100,002 or 1,000,000.) I'd expect them to care a little more and actively seek ways to please their continually shrinking playerbase. It seems everything I read on the flying matter leads to GMs being extremely sarcastic and even rude to players who want it in, like it's THAT big of a deal. They seem to act as if all of their decisions are golden when obviously they're not or people wouldn't feel the need to bot the boring parts of the game to focus on actually having fun (I guarantee a large portion of the bans were for Garrison botting, 9 out of 11 people who were banned in my guild were only Garrison botting.) or leaving the game altogether (at least the botters were still paying.) <br />

All i'm saying (TL;DR if you will) is that if I was Blizzard i'd actually listen and put an effort into satisfying the community before more people leave, they need to get out of the mindset that they'll always be on top because that mindset leads to people falling.

No, but I wouldn't be rude to paying customers for simply wanting something that has been in the game since the first expansion. I also wouldn't put in things nobody is asking for and is pretty obvious that nobody will use for more than an achievement or two (selfie camera and twitter integration.)

Wow, so instead of 5... I can do.. 20? Why not an entire stack of 200?<br />
<br />
If I want 150 instead of 200 I simply separate it to 50/150 and mill the 150.<br />
<br />
This is.. hilariously stupid.<br />
<br />
You realize how worthless that would be if you can't even get a stack of 200? Some people don't run around with stacks of 200. It's infuriating enough that you have to have a stack of 5 before you can mill anything.<br />
<br />
You didn't think through this complaint enough. You only complained because it doesn't fit some weird circumstance where you're dealing with full stacks of everything when 20 is a number that scales better. You know... because 20 x 10 = 200?</div></div><hr />

I don't think you understand that its a moving target. Unless people dont report your new toxic behavior.... In which case it wasnt really toxic, the auto-ban system learns to recognize it and you get banned. Sure, the really imaginative trolls might stay a step ahead for a little while, but it won't last.</div></div><hr />
