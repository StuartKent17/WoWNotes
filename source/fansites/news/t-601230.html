Hyjal post on Elitistjerks.com (http://elitistjerks.com/showthread.php?t=11407)<br />
When you zone into the raid instance you start out, as Alliance, at a small alliance base with lady Jaine Proudmoore and lots of 70 elites, including horsemen, dwarf riflemen, NE priests, bloodelf Sorceress' (?).<br />
<br />
The starting area is standard alliance structures, few towers and buildings, think Theramore. You start the encounter and rush out to fight Undead - a few 70 elite abominations (naxx) are the first encounter.<br />

The &quot;Battle of Hyjal&quot; was some years BEFORE (some of) the Highelves called themselves &quot;Bloodelves&quot;. So the mobs you see there are Highelves (not NE!).</div></div><hr />
