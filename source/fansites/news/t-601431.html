<br />
Anyway, awesome bow :o<br />
<br />
EDIT: proc on succesful attack not &quot;Chance on Hit:&quot; :x</div></div><hr />

<br />
Over a 6 minutes fight, that's 1440 free mana. ^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghrim</div><div class="date">2007-06-26, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a hunter counting in Auto-Shot and all yellow shots you use (depending on the cycle but it should be more or less the same) it's like one shot in well let's say 1.5 seconds making these 8 mana about 30mp5, which - imho - is not THAT bad, right?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faelyn</div><div class="date">2007-06-26, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you really want to convert it to MP5, it would become about 27 MP5 if Blizzard rounds it up. Exact number would be 26 2/3 MP5.<br />
<br />
Pretty neat bow, yeah. :O</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghrim</div><div class="date">2007-06-26, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thatswhy i said ABOUT 30. Counting in, that it is not always exactly 1.5, you know? And these numbars make this bow indeed awesome for long boss fights.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Murasame</div><div class="date">2007-06-26, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Glad to see they made this bow different from the archimonde bow. Oh wait! Then again most raids only have one hunters. Hell have some nice weaps to play with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
god damn blizzard are retarded</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-06-27, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does look different then the archimonde bow.. quite different if you look at details<br />
<br />
This bow is really nice in pvp for raids, if you have 3-4 hunters equipped with this, could be very nice on specific boss fights, now my question is, the tooltip says &quot;On Successful melee or ranged attack, gain 8 mana, and if possible leech 8 mana from the target&quot;<br />
<br />
Does this mean you would gain 8 per shot, and then leech 8, coming to a total of +16 mana per successful shot?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You got 8 mana per shot or whack , and if your target got mana bar, it kills another 8 from that mob, not drain.<br />
<br />
This is exactly the same effect as http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22194</div></div><hr />
