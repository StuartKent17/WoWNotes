At BlizzCon 2018, we proposed a plan to give Classic four content phases. These were planned to be centered primarily on raid power progression.<br />
<br />
Currently, based on both your feedback and our own deliberations, we’re now planning to increase it to six phases. Our focus is still primarily on player power-progression, but we’re also aiming to capture what it felt like to play in a realm community in original WoW. To do that, we’re planning to mirror the approach taken by original WoW, with patches paired together. We’ll launch Classic with content from original WoW through patch 1.2.x, then the second update will include content that was in original WoW 1.3 and 1.4, the third Classic update will have 1.5 and 1.6 content, and so on.<br />
<br />
Our first phase primarily focuses on launching Classic with Onyxia and Molten Core, but we’ve decided to hold off on Dire Maul for a while. Maraudon is still in the first phase, because it was originally released on December 18, 2004, just two weeks after the first player hit level 60, but we recognize that Dire Maul is in a different category. Some of the loot that’s attainable from Dire Maul is so good that it would affect progression through those early raids. We’re also planning to hold off on releasing Kazzak and Azuregos at launch as well, for the same reasons.<br />
<br />
The next change we’re targeting addresses two concerns. First, Zul’Gurub and Blackwing Lair unlocking at the same time would differ from how they originally came out, and it makes sense to not have gear and enchants from Zul’Gurub available during early progress into Blackwing Lair. Secondly, the Emerald Dragons should be available earlier than the opening of Ahn’Qiraj, as they give us a way to start preparing nature resist gear for some of the encounters in AQ.<br />
<br />
Along the way, we’ve taken a close look at items that provide the biggest power gains, many of which were introduced in 1.10 as part of a sweeping dungeon itemization pass. That patch was when Tier 0.5 gear was introduced, and Relics were added to the drop tables of many bosses. It also adjusted drop rates and drop locations of a lot of gear (to make room for the Relics). We’ve gone back and reconstructed many of the most heavily affected drop tables as they existed prior to the 1.10 patch, and we’re planning to update the drop tables alongside the Ahn’Qiraj War Effort. Prior to the Ahn’Qiraj unlock, most of the drop rates and locations will look as they did in the patches prior to 1.10, with exceptions—there are lots of little changes made in earlier patches that don’t have a big effect on player power, and in those cases, we’re planning to use the 1.12 drop rates and locations.<br />
<br />
One example of the many items we’re planning for is: Titanic Leggings, which is a world drop that first appeared in 1.10. We can confirm that it will be controlled by the same content unlock that restricts the other 1.10 loot changes.<br />
<br />
Here’s what the release order currently looks like:<br />
<br />
Phase 1 (Classic Launch)<br />
<br />
Molten Core<br />
Onyxia<br />
Maraudon<br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 2<br />
<br />
Dire Maul<br />
Azuregos<br />
Kazzak<br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 3<br />
<br />
Blackwing Lair<br />
Darkmoon Faire<br />
Darkmoon deck drops begin<br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 4<br />
<br />
Zul’Gurub<br />
Green Dragons<br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 5<br />
<br />
Ahn’Qiraj War Effort begins<br />
Ahn’Qiraj raids open when the war effort dictates<br />
Dungeon loot reconfiguration: Tier 0.5 Dungeon gear, Relics, drop rates and location changes<br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 6<br />
<br />
Naxxramas<br />
Scourge Invasion<br />
<br />
<br />
We haven’t yet determined exactly when phases 2-6 will occur, and PvP content is notably missing from the list above. That’s because we’re still evaluating our options regarding PvP rewards, as they also changed over time (both in power and in terms of which PvP reward items were available).<br />
While we can’t elaborate on every detail of every step we’re going to take (yet), we’re here reading all of your questions and we’re going to keep the answers coming.<br />

This way we can progress as if it was really 2004. Hopefully phases will be longer then 3 months. I would imagine Phase 1 being closer to a year given the need to ding 60, farm dungeons for Tier 0 then progress through Core and Onyxia. Other phases would be shorter I would imagine but this makes me excited about Classic.</div></div><hr />

This is probably as close to the classic release schedule as they can get when it comes to power progression.</div></div><hr />

Can't wait to play this in Summer. Will be a fresh new experience for me as I never played Classic. Can't wait for the community to flourish and hell be bigger than retail.<br />

This isn't gating, this is basically patch releases. Why would they release all raids at the beginning? The classic experience should be like the original in progression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What a perfect example of intellectual dishonesty :)<br />
<br />
Nobody cries, that BfA's content is not released at once, which means: 8.0-8.3 in the first day of the expansion launch. The complaint is about a much different thing... and you genuinely know it. It's about the content in a single patch being stretched to the maxium.<br />
And that applies to Classic - it will be released in patches, so the content won't cannibalize itself in few weeks.<br />
<br />

Gives people a chance to sink into 'current content' a bit more - go do Onyxia and Molten Core, then maybe go do something else than gearing for a bit (or, god forbid, go do something else and appreciate things that are not WoW since we don't have to do dailies/mission boards every day. Or the weekly M+ / PvP caches). And then when the new content is coming out, just to get straight back into it and repeat.</div></div><hr />

I prefer something that doesn't get shut down after six months or have all progress wiped regularly, or have gold sellers come in and fuck people over.</div></div><hr />

Gating is different from a release schedule. Classic wow didnt release with every single raid active. There are tons of world events that surround each of these releases. If you don't want to play classic, don't play it.</div></div><hr />

Classic has even less content: leveling, no heroic/mythic dungeons/raids/BGs. That's all.<br />

There is nothing to back up your 80% number and even less for the gone for good part. Classic will have less content then bfa with literally none of it being new.<br />

Molten core came with launch a actual example would be black wing lair in 1.6 which it looks like came out with pretty much no content other then the dark moon fair if you count that.<br />

<br />
I hope people realize that while the gating is in different phases, that the phase length shouldn't be consistent across each phase. For example it's not going to be a linear 6 months between phases or 'seasons' like it's been operating with WoW on live for the past few expansions. Phase 2 should happen shortly after launch, with phase 4 happening shortly after BWLs launch. The only really 'large' gaps should be between phase 5 and phase 6.<br />
<br />
Can't expect everything. Some people want them to update talents/classes through the phases, which I think is pretty unreasonable. Some classes are just going to be more powerful on launch of classic than they were 14 years ago, so just deal with it. If you're going into this thinking the difficulty is going to be exactly authentic, you seriously need a time machine because this is as close as it's going to get. Be happy that they are staggering the content to some fashion. Constantly changing classes would be jarring IMO in a world that we already know.</div></div><hr />

Sad thing is that people are basically pissing on each other, hating and flaming over what is essentially THE SAME GAME, just at different points in time.<br />
<br />
Jesus..it is still WoW. It seems to me people even see two Blizzards in here, the Blizzard that works on retail and needs to go bankrupt and the Blizzard that releases Classic servers and has the sun shining out its ass.<br />
<br />
No wonder the world beyond WoW is as shitty as it is if we are THAT petty.<br />

Why not let everyone have fun and enjoy what they like without being toxic and judgemental about it?</div></div><hr />

Thats only when you look at it on paper. In practice its far from that... theres alot more to it.<br />
<br />
We can do the same about retail too... &quot;all content on retail is essentially 1 day of leveling followed by nonstop world quest grind which doesnt let you choose when to do them since they reset on irregular times&quot; :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Sorry to ruin your imaginary world, but Classic is 4-6 days /played spent lvling and a lot more dungeon runs to get the piece that u're going to wear for the next year or so after that and a lot more after. Also astonishing open world PvP which isn't meaningless at all unlike &quot;enable the regime&quot; system blizzord put in place @BFA.</div></div><hr />

Do you not know the differance between systems and content? World quest and mythic+ are both legion systems but what we have now was not legion content. <br />

Private server model had some serious itemisation flaws with things being out of place due to 1.12 patch, but since it would seem that at least the part of Blizzard which are managing Classic release are actually NOT out of touch with it's playebase/community unlike &quot;retail&quot; one - they are adressing this and it feels promising.</div></div><hr />

Can't wait to play this in Summer. Will be a fresh new experience for me as I never played Classic. Can't wait for the community to flourish and hell be bigger than retail.<br />
<br />
Although played older MMOs so the time investment thing shouldn't be an issue for me.<br />
<br />
Classic community was the best experience about the game back then tbh. It wasn't perfect for sure but you get that sense and vibe of one big community that one server is like one big family, so some people will be more careful how to treat each other since there is no cross realms and stuff like that.</div></div><hr />

Legion didn't have the same dungeons or even the same affixes and it didn’t have the same world quest. So not it’s not even close to the same thing you did in legion.</div></div><hr />

While yes most daily’s haven’t changed since tbc ( don’t know if classic had daily’s) there are some new ones which would count as new content even if they aren’t great (loa can go straight to hell).<br />
<br />
As far as mythic+ goes without the dungons it’s just an empty system that does nothing and it seems unlikly he was bringing up mythic+ as an empty system when you were taking about content in your original post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People are leaving BfA, but is not just BfA that's boring: WoW at its core is boring, no matter what version of it.<br />
<br />
Or because when you kill immersion, player agency and major RPG aspects of the game for the sake of removing any danger, creating endless carrot-on-stick chases and streamlining everything, it becomes a soulless shell of barely decent &quot;action&quot; gameplay that isn't engaging in the long-term, much less what one who played earlier versions of WoW could even consider a MMORPG.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, BfA is not bad. I think it's ok, though it could be much better if class design was more akin to anywhere between WotLK and MoP (hell, even WoD), if the reward system was better (emblems/valor points please), if there was less RNG on loot (or if random improvements to loot were obtainable deterministicly - again, valor points please) and if content wasn't so streamlined and gated.<br />
<br />
Even then, it would still be a very different beast of a game overall, despite having the same core.</div></div><hr />

A few things.<br />
<br />
1st, every thing blizzard does is for money they do nothing soly for our benefit.<br />
<br />
2nd, while the trolls were done fat humans were not so they weren't pushed back for money alone they weren't ready yet.<br />
<br />
3rd, I don’t think any other race came out with a discount on changes so this is a positive compared to every other race release.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">McNeil</div><div class="date">2019-03-11, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great news. These kind of patches causes the game to change quite a bit with all the new BiS gear, like where Dire Maul was the ideal place to farm. Its only good that they follow these phases to properly progress the game. I wonder if Blizzard decides to add more ''new'' phases, or going straight to TBC when Classic is over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What happens when all the phases are released and people complain when they missed out on the &quot;authentic&quot; patch phasing experience?<br />
<br />
They can create seasonal servers, that start every so often at &quot;Classic Launch&quot; and follow the same release plan, and then either get merged to the old servers that were already at the last content phase, or reset altogether after several months.<br />
<br />
Or they can just ignore those people - it's not like Classic is a small secret project, I would guess the majority of people who have any interest in it have heard about it or will definitely hear about it before it's launched.<br />
<br />
Of course there will be people with complains like that sooner or later, and if there are enough of them I'm sure they can consider starting a fresh server. Even without people complaining I think it could be a valuable tool in increasing WoW's value and longevity overall.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who claims the delay in release now wasn't based on financial reasons to encourage Race Change is going to have some massive egg on their face. Putting a sale on race/facion changes the same day they release? Jesus wept, they are going to rake in the cash...<br />
<br />
Is there really any issue with this though? It not like Blizz is announcing these features in conjunction with new races. People are going to race change day one regardless. I for one am happy to save a couple bucks.</div></div><hr />

People crying on retail about content taking too long to release just to come to Classic news about content taking a while to release and singing its praises.<br />
So what does this mean? In 2 years people will get to raid Naxx? Face it, Blizz either realized people would have all of the content cleared in less than a month if it was released like a Private Server and grow bored, and/or they want to last as long as possible to make it appear they didn’t waste many hours of developing an old game. It’s already getting released in a 1.13 state which means it’s starting at a patch that never existed to provide spec and class balancing that was never around when these thing were first released.<br />
Regardless, I still hope it’s a success so people can have some enjoyment out of it.”, but it’s pretty funny seeing people like Eleccybub hate on Retail for things like prolonging raid tiers just to come into Classic posts and type about how good of a thing it is to slow down raid releases.</div></div><hr />

It's called 'temptation'. You might buy X thing if it's a whole $20, but if it's got a 30% discount, suddenly it's going to be a lot more appealing.

I do indeed hope they plan on progressing the classic server. I'm unsure of the proper approach to handle it, as it would eventually get to the point of people wanting... classic again.<br />

I want want them to charge more, I just want them to not use these predatory practices. Did you not understand what I was trying to explain about discounts? Should I break it down further?<br />

If you say, &quot;We have this new thing we're selling!&quot; and people say, &quot;Well, that's too expensive, we won't buy it.&quot; and your response is, &quot;Well okay, we'll reduce the price for a little while by a lot!&quot; so the people then go, &quot;Hhhmm... well maybe one would be fine.&quot; then that's scummy practices. If they really wanted to make it cheaper for everyone, they'd just reduce their prices permanently. This is just a tactic to boost their sales from people who otherwise wouldn't consider it. They're not looking out for the consumer in any way.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but I don’t see how this could fall under predatory. People who want the race will get them either way just how they have with every single other race release. Blizzard giving a discount isn’t going to make people flock to a race they wernt going to play to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Sorry buddy, but that's just your perception on this. At no point is a new visual skin for your character &quot;Content&quot;. About the only content they produce for the new races are the very small chains for your armor. To say that this is content, is hilarious. Furthermore, what would you consider .... Death Knights? Demon Hunters? Pandarens. Cash grabs? YOU WANT TO BE ONE OF THESE? PAY FULL PRICE OR BOOST.<br />
<br />
Those are worse cash grabs, because they DONT discount them. In this case, they are releasing something probably later than anyone expected since KT's were done, and in doing so they are providing a slight decrease in cost.<br />
<br />
I think if I were to actually criticize anything related to this, I would criticize the CURRENT PRICING for all of their value services. They are all too expensive. There should be no reason why a faction change costs $30 USD, and Warcraft 3 Remastered also costs $30. And this isn't because WC3R is underpriced, it's because the value services are EXTREMELY overpriced. <br />
<br />
We are quickly reaching the point that server doesnt matter, and the Race change is the only service that actually should cost 20-30. Everything else should be a $5-10 cost, max. Character Customizations should be $5 max, and it will mostly be used to change gender. Race change should be 7-10 max, and PCT's shouldn't even really exist. Faction change should be $20 max and bundled pricing to convert all characters on a realm for a flat fee of like 60. <br />
<br />
That is the real travesty here. Not a sale to help new &quot;content&quot; (READ: PLAYERS SKINS) be easier to do, financially.</div></div><hr />

No, but those people probably would've just gotten those races in the free methods that are available. Like I said, it's all about temptation. You're being tempted with the thing you could've easily gotten before, but for more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUT it's a pretty good evidence that the team takes Classic seriously, and it will recreate for a time how it happened in Vanilla. So I still consider it a plus, even if it's not strictly speaking my preferences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not &quot;a lot more appealing&quot; to anyone who already considered race changing, you're blowing shit out of proportion. Most players hold off until holiday sales for character services.<br />
<br />
There are no &quot;free methods&quot; either as leveling is not the same as preserving existing characters (with bags, loot, reputation and all). At this point it's common to have alts above 100 that won't be replaced unless you have nothing to lose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Black Friday is the biggest sales day of the year not because of temptation but because that’s the day they mark everything down. And yes, I understand the concept of impulse buys (the reason candy is right next to the checkout); however, Blizz is literally offering a discount to people who are already planning on race changing. You’re saying that they are doing it to get more people to race change, which could have a part to play, but at the same time you and others are bitching about Zandalari and KT and know people are going to race change, yet you complain when Blizz does something that helps these people.<br />
Would you be happier if Blizz did a poll of who is going to race change and then only gave those people who answered yes the discount? Never mind, you probably would.</div></div><hr />

For people who don't think, maybe.<br />
For others, the amount of actual relevant content and its duration is much more relevant than a dumb list of the different types of content.<br />
<br />
Leveling in Vanilla alone was at least five times longer than it is current WoW, so saying &quot;well, we have leveling in both&quot; as if it were equal is, well, dumb (now, people can prefer a short leveling, but that's preference, not amount of content).<br />
Gearing at max level through dungeons was much slower, power progression was much smaller, dungeons were much bigger. A guy can spam faceroll a few 5-man in BfA and get its blue ready for entry-level raiding in the same time as it take someone to clear a single dungeon in Vanilla, where he has only a chance to get an item (again, some people might prefer the quick gearing and claim that Vanilla is just artificial gear starvation, but the fact is, content stay relevant for much longer in Vanilla, and a single dungeon provides for as much time played as several ones in current WoW).<br />

If there's one thing that I would like to see them deviate from, it would be to somehow allow everyone to experience the opening of the AQ gates, whether it be through a lengthy cut-scene or a scenario (I believe that would be possible if they're sitting the 'old build' on the current platform... or at least a more current platform).<br />

Why would you need or want to transfer between connected servers? They're connected. And in the patch you can have up to 50 characters per server.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure almost everyone wanted Classic servers to be progressive, so that you do content in the same order it was released originally.<br />
<br />
Classic didn't launch with all the patch content, it rolled out gradually over a few years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or they can just ignore those people - it's not like Classic is a small secret project, I would guess the majority of people who have any interest in it have heard about it or will definitely hear about it before it's launched.<br />
<br />
Of course there will be people with complains like that sooner or later, and if there are enough of them I'm sure they can consider starting a fresh server. Even without people complaining I think it could be a valuable tool in increasing WoW's value and longevity overall.<br />
<br />
As someone with countless twinks even back in Vanilla, I can tell you, that this would wear people out quickly. WoW isn't Diablo. I farmed BWL for 10 months without ever getting my T2 chestpiece as it dropped only once for my class. This is something I don't want to relive, especially on a regular basis.<br />
I really can't tell where this might be going. They could actually continue on with an alternate storyline, while staying true to classic WoW gameplay wise (but making all specs viable), incl. the classic skill trees. But some people might not like any change at all.</div></div><hr />

It'd be interesting if it was liked enough, they went back and rereleased each expansion on it, but reimagined to stay true to vanilla gameplay. TBC wouldn't change much, but WOTLK would never have LFG added etc.</div></div><hr />

Also, pallies and locks won’t have their class mounts (Fast speed ones.) until Dire Maul opens.<br />

I feel you. I think even farming BWL at 90 for some T2 sets I had to run it at least 20 times to finish my warlock set. For some reason it really liked my hunter and basically finished it in 2 weeks.<br />

Competing with an entire raid with maybe 4-6 others of your class and seeing one drop in 10 months would make me consider unsubbing.</div></div><hr />

And btw, don't take things so seriously. Also, you were full of assumptions. Let me guess, you are not big fan of Classic idea, right?<br />
<br />
Since this came thru before my ignore, let me answer it:<br />
You have just proven that you didn’t even read my whole post you quoted to start this issue. If you had you would have seen that I am happy for people getting Classic and hope it is a success. My criticism was never about Classic, in that post, and was directly about people who go into retail forums to criticize and hate on live for things like patch releases and not having everything available faster and then go into Classic forums to sing the praises of the exact same thing they just spewed hate against.<br />
You say I am full of assumptions, but what assumptions were those? Oh wait, I won’t see your reply. Let’s just leave it at this, nothing was assumed. You can literally go into Eleccybub’s post history and see where he hates on retail for things like raids being patch released and then comes into this forum and talks about how great it is.</div></div><hr />

Aye I mean in the really long-term, as more people might grow interest in playing through that content release progression.<br />
<br />
New Classic-like content would be amazing to see but sadly I doubt it will ever happen. Moving onwards to Classic TBC is the most cost-effective and therefore most likely continuity, if we ever get any at all. (I hope that does happen, at least until Classic WotLK). Which would still be amazing, don't take me the wrong way, just not as interesting as fresh new content with Classic gameplay.<br />

No one is saying a sale is a bad thing. But they are not doing a sale because they're our friends or don't want us to spend so much money. They are doing it because it will increase the total amount of money they get.<br />

It simply hints at further profit-oriented choices having too much of a grip on the game, which paired with the current atmosphere surrounding the game, and other similar decisions that have been plaguing the game, makes it only logical to expect such a perception from the playerbase..</div></div><hr />

Actually, a favourite way to pass time on Private servers is to speed level and do timed clears on the raid content.<br />
<br />
What innovative concepts! <br />
<br />
Whilst it's nice to see them going with the tiered release of the content rather than dropping it all in one go, one can't really be happy for the crowd that's been so toxic for all these years and, no doubt, will continue to be. &quot;Classic will be more popular than Retail!&quot; huh? Because we all know how long the goodwill of WoW fans tend to last, especially when there's no more content on the close horizon. The entitlement and criticism will kick in soon enough.<br />
<br />
And no matter how one spins it, Classic will still be populated by players of today, not 2004.</div></div><hr />

Don't remember how long it took me to level my very first character when I was a complete noob but on every other character after that dinged level 60 in Winterspring in 4 days played just doing normal quests and natural dungeon progression.

Average / regular players won't even play Classic, not as more than an idle pastime anyway. They simply will not really exist like they did back then. <br />

<br />
But I think it will be hard for guilds to manage to have 40+ active players, when most are playing retail.<br />
<br />
Even retail guilds are struggling. Used to get invites all the time when leveling alts, and now I've seen zero invites in whole 1-120 experience. And all guilds my toons are in, that used to be very popular, are also totally dead now.<br />
<br />
So sounds like pugging will be required. At least the mechanics are simple in most encounters.</div></div><hr />

And let's not forget those ninja looters. I hope Classic can fix these issues. Plus who wants to fight over mobs with a million people, cause you know day 1 is gonna be insane. <br />
<br />
Anyways, I think the schedule looks good. I just don't know what I want to play.<br />
<br />
Yeah to be honest I would prefer something like remastered version instead of perfect copy of vanilla at 1.12. At the end a lot of stuff was rushed up and not very well balanced or coherent. During its lifetime there were many updates and changes. These changes would continue if TBC didn't come up.<br />
<br />
It's like people wanting to play Diablo LoD 1.07. While they could play 1.14. which is fairly better tuned up.<br />
<br />
Better itemization. So I can actually progress with spec I want.<br />
Better spec balance. Some specs are more like filler tress in vanilla instead of full-featured specs.<br />
More reasonable quest rewards. Seriously, why quest which makes you to run over half of the world gives you same reward as quest which requires you to kill 10 monsters which are all around you?<br />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, BfA is not bad. I think it's ok, though it could be much better if class design was more akin to anywhere between WotLK and MoP (hell, even WoD), if the reward system was better (emblems/valor points please), if there was less RNG on loot (or if random improvements to loot were obtainable deterministicly - again, valor points please) and if content wasn't so streamlined and gated.<br />
<br />
Even then, it would still be a very different beast of a game overall, despite having the same core.<br />
<br />
Agreed with you, except on two things, people had danger in BFA at the start, there was a point leveling that if you were naive you could die, I actually liked that, unlike many people. Having to use CD's to survive 3-4 mobs is something I haven't done since... lich king maybe?<br />
<br />
I understand tho, that after leveling one character it becomes a hassle.<br />
<br />
And the other thing would be fury warrior, I'm loving it I've never been interested in any dps spec for raiding (I've always been a healer) but Fury got me, It's simple I know but I don't know I feel like a god! And it actually does good dps and I'm not even min-maxing everything. I know that you didn't mean all the classes but I had to say it! I'm in love! haha</div></div><hr />

Heaven forbid someone makes game because they want to make a game, and not because they want to keep alive an interface for payment systems with the sole purpose of making the absolute most money possible.<br />
<br />
Don't strawman. No one is complaining about them making profit. People complain / are concerned because they perceive that the profit is the driving factor. Good games come from developers who want to make good games, and then find ways to make them economically viable. Not from developers who are forced to generate X amounts of money, and then build a game around that.</div></div><hr />

It will be a bunch of current or past regular players who already know the gist of the game and there will be a bunch of elitist hardcores plowing to be &quot;first&quot; to redo what the fuck ever. Just like on the EQ progression servers.<br />
<br />
No content will last unless it's mathematically locked up because there are tons of people with experience with that content and all the info you'd ever need sitting on the web.<br />
<br />
The ludicrous notion that people will get caught up &quot;exploring&quot; something that is 14 years old and that most of the people dabbling in have seen in one form or another is laughable. A lot will race through it, a few will try it and find it tedious and an even smaller number of people will proclaim the miserableness of it all to be the best thing ever.<br />
<br />
On the whole it will be a short lived niche novelty for most and a refuge for a few people who get an ego boost from playing a video game that is &quot;hard&quot; because it is time consuming if you don't know what the fuck you're doing.</div></div><hr />

I see it as a curiosity mostly. I agree with your assessment, but there's one group you've omitted though - I can see it being popular with a subset of roleplayers, but they won't be racing to anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because I'm a lazy person and I want ALL of my characters on ONE realm now that it's extended to 50.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We should get something like that: 1 free transfer (or race/faction change) for every 30 days subbed. Blizz would still get money from whales, but patient (and loyal) players would slowly transfer their chars to different server.</div></div><hr />

News flash!<br />
<br />
This thread isn't in the classic forum! It's news that covers other topics.<br />

Heaven forbid someone makes game because they want to make a game, and not because they want to keep alive an interface for payment systems with the sole purpose of making the absolute most money possible.<br />
<br />
Don't strawman. No one is complaining about them making profit. People complain / are concerned because they perceive that the profit is the driving factor. Good games come from developers who want to make good games, and then find ways to make them economically viable. Not from developers who are forced to generate X amounts of money, and then build a game around that.<br />
<br />
Please... Developers are more than capable of making a game both because they love it and also to make a profit. It's not a one or the other type of deal...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course they are, but just because it is possible doesn't mean it is the case at the moment.<br />
<br />
It just becomes hard to believe this as a consumer given the current state of the game, atmosphere of the community, and how much monetization seems to be attached to everything they do - in a game where we are already paying box price and a monthly subscription.<br />
<br />
Might I refresh your memory, a few years ago, soon after Warlords of Draenor was released, they stated that the playerbase is cyclical, with a lot of people resubscribing only for a couple months, and that that was ok. Nowadays it seems they have an opposite opinion and are time and time again doing whatever they can to artificially extend how long people are subscribed, without actually offering more or better content.<br />
<br />
I'm not even saying it's the developers' fault, they likely get exactly the same paycheck and bonuses regardless if they sell 0 or a million race changes. But I do strongly believe their creativity and productivity is being heavily impacted by the unsustainable profit growth expectations by the part of the higher-ups and investors.</div></div><hr />
