Hunters / Warlock Pet Management in WotLK<br />
There are 2 additional slots in the stable. Integrating hunter / warlock pet management into the new mount and companion UI has certainly come up already. Let's give the new UI a whirl and see if it works and then we can consider if it makes sense to integrate the stable or anything else into it. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557246019&amp;sid=2000&amp;pageNo=2#24))<br />

Lake Wintergrasp<br />
There will be a lot of tuning and balancing of the zone done in the coming months. One thing we are looking to do though to help with population imbalances is impose certain benefits for the side with less players in the zone. For instance, since supplies will be necessary to unlock certain vehicles, the side with the population handicap may see a decrease in requirements. We may also offer increasingly more supply benefits for a faction if they are suffering from consecutive losses in Lake Wintergrasp. The goal is to even the playing field regardless of faction population balances across all realms.<br />
<br />
We plan to give Lake Wintergrasp a definitive play time where the event may last somewhere around 45 minutes. The event would not start again for a set amount of time after the battle is won. We will tune these times as testing further develops. The plan, additionally, is to provide certain incentives for visiting this zone between battles.

Pets should be able to hold aggro, especially tanking pets with the right spec. Class dps in general is something we are still evaluating, because honestly it's a lot of wasted work if we haven't finalized the abilities yet. Once we have a feel for how much dps a hunter can do, and how much threat you generate, we'll adjust pets accordingly.

In the next data push, you will find Omen of Clarity has been changed a bit. The 10 second cooldown has been removed, the procs per minute has been raised from 2 to 3.5, and melee abilities no longer trigger it. Spell interaction with Omen of Clarity remains relatively unchanged, with its hidden chance to trigger off spells reduced by half (and rolling the dice about 2x as often).<br />
<br />
What this means is that more auto-attacks landing on the target will increase the benefit from Omen of Clarity. Haste, increased hit chance, and expertise will all make Omen of Clarity better.<br />
<br />
We are aware of the concerns with reaching the hit rating cap, and will make sure Druids can pick up Rogue items to wear without exceeding that cap. This means Rogues will likely socket for hit, while Druids socket for Strength or Agility.<br />
<br />
Before LK goes live, we will do extensive testing on how much damage classes do, and will increase or decrease their power as appropriate to meet our targets. Cat raid DPS suffered relative to other melee in BC for lack of an Combat Potency equivalent talent (OOC should now be roughly equal), for lack of a scaling finishing move (Savage Roar answers that), for lack of benefitting from Windfury Totem, and for lack of weapon procs (+35 agility != Mongoose). All of those lacks have been addressed. In addition, a change has been made to make the agility rebalance less severe (as I posted in another thread).<br />
<br />
In PvP, we are adding many tools to the Feral Druid arsenal, including the redesigned Maim, Infected Wounds, King of the Jungle, and Berserk. We have also made some improvements to the &quot;range bug&quot;. Attacks that require you to be behind a target will no longer be able to be parried, nor able to be dodged by a player. Our movement engine will now smoothly interpolate positions of moving units, preventing the &quot;Out of range/You must be behind your target/Out of range/You must be behind your target/Out of range/You must be behind your target...&quot; sequence from occuring any more. In addition, being able to apply a snare makes the Feral Druid able to slow down their target and lessen the severity of the &quot;range bug&quot;. Yes, there are still issues with the model, especially when switching into and out of cat form, but many of the issues are being dealt with.

<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
To help deal with this issue, in the next data push, Druids should find their melee critical strike chance is about 5% higher.<br />
<br />
The conversion of agility to critical strike chance remains the same 40:1 at level 70, but the base amount for 0 agility has been increased by 5%. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8429963449&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=2000#8))<br />

Clarification on Fair Gameplay in Arenas<br />
There have been a number of questions recently on what exactly falls into the category of Win Trading in Arena matches, and therefore what is and is not considered acceptable, so we would like to provide some clarification on what is considered fair gameplay in Arena matches.<br />
<br />
The act of Win Trading may be described as the carrying out of premeditated plans to rise in arena rating by means of determining the outcome of a match prior or during its taking place. Win trading goes against the spirit of World of Warcraft and devalues the enjoyment of the game for all players who earn their victories by competing in a fair environment.<br />
<br />
Win Trading includes players tampering with, or otherwise abusing the queue system as well as colluding to enter into an arena match with a specific opposing team. In the case of arena collusion, we consider any situation where the standard queue possibilities are bypassed through an abuse of mechanics to be a violation of policy. This includes, but is not limited to, the act of tampering with one’s team roster with exploitive intentions as well as setting up a situation that bypasses the randomness of our queue system where a team has a specific and predetermined opponent and repeatedly faces that team. Queuing against a known and affiliated opponent gives a competitive advantage over players who are entering the queue at random. We have measures in place to take action against any account found to be using these practices to advance their characters.<br />
<br />
These described actions all fall in line with our fair use clause in the Terms of Use, which specifically states:<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, certain acts go beyond what is &quot;fair&quot; and are considered serious violations of these Terms of Use. Those acts include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:<br />
1. Using or exploiting errors in design, features which have not been documented, and/or &quot;program bugs&quot; to gain access that is otherwise not available, or to obtain a competitive advantage over other players;<br />
<br />
With that being said we are aware that players will often face the same team multiple times in succession due to a lack of similarly rated teams in the queue. Naturally this is not in violation, nor should players worry if ever they happen upon a situation such as this, but we will invoke action against any team when the team in question creates an agreement to exchange matches or tamper with the queuing system. Regardless of the content of these games, this presents a conflict of interest that we wish to deter in order to keep our arena system competitive.<br />
<br />
In our continued efforts to support fair gameplay we have taken steps to ensure fair and enjoyable competition in the Arena by taking action on players who are found to be involved in Win Trading. Actions for violations may include not only penalties to the account but also confiscation of any gear that has been won if deemed necessary. Our Support staff will continue to enforce fair gameplay in Arena matches and all aspects of the game and will continue to address any new concerns to ensure that the playing field is kept fair.<br />

My favourite of the day is &quot;Righteous Defense no longer costs mana and the global cooldown has been removed&quot; So many times have people died because I've been oom and can't taunt, if I'm not getting hit i can't get mana so i can't taunt. It is a horrible cycle</div></div><hr />

Unless you are landing more than 75% as many melee abilities as you are landing white attacks this will be a buff. The only place it could possibly be a nerf is in multimob swipe spam if each attack can presently proc omen (I don't know if it can or can't though. In any single targe situation this would be a buff though.</div></div><hr />

What i'm most concerned with is no more JoRighteousness, if i'm reading it right ofc. That's one helluva tanking nerf.<br />

<br />
That's exactly what I was just thinking. JoR was always great for a quick aggro snap and front-loading threat on main target. I guess now that we have the Shield of Righteousness we MAY not need it. And come to think of it, looking at the name, maybe it was indeed intended to replace JoR. <br />
<br />
I'm very confused/concerned about this. I see nowhere where the Seals were explicitly taken out, but it seems odd that they would leave no mention of them in the 'Seals' section. SoL is the bread-and-butter of AOE grinding/farming. I would be sad if they removed it. <br />

they also removed our only reason to be in raids, since now a holy pally or a prot pally can spec to have his judgements giving the +3%crit chance to the raid. I doubt that someone will allow a ret pally just for +2% dmg to the whole raid, well maybe for the 3% haste, but still, many raid leaders would prefer a class that does not depends on luck for dpsing, yes paladins depend on luck even if you have 30% crit, if you are really unlucky you can go for a whole minute without a single crit</div></div><hr />

This is not the case. Most of the seals are still there, but you can use either JoJ/JoL/JoW now, independant on what seal you are using. So for the quick aggro snap you will have SoR active, and then use JoW for damage AND the wisdom debuff. Or if you want max damage use JoJ.</div></div><hr />

Ah ha! It all makes sense now! You are a gentleman and a scholar, Ulgut. Thanks for clearing that up. So, this change is actually nothing short of INCREDIBLE! <br />
<br />
I like how we're getting all these changes, it's quite interesting. We're getting a lot of help on the tanking front, which I absolutely love (not to mention the other specs). It seems, however, that'll we'll be playing an almost completely different class now. I don't necessarily mind that, however, because it seems that we'll get to be a bit more 'interactive' in our game play, so to speak.</div></div><hr />

ok so if i'm not wrong, if i judge with light it will judge my current seal + a healing effect, if i judge with wisdom it will restore mana, and if i judge with justice it will do more dmg. sounds really nice</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Clasifyd</div><div class="date">2008-07-31, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been looking over the pally skills (slow day at work) and it actually seems to be a little off from what Ulgut was saying. I could be COMPLETELY wrong, but this is what I'm gathering. <br />
<br />
As an example, I'll use Seal of Wisdom and Judgment of Justice. <br />
With the new spells, they both read as follows:<br />
<br />
Seal of Wisdom<br />
--------------<br />
Fills the Paladin with divine wisdom for 2 min, giving each melee attack a chance to restore [ 14% of AP ] mana to the Paladin. Only one Seal can be active on the Paladin at any one time.<br />
Unleashing this Seal's energy will deal [ 36% of AP + 1 ] Holy damage to an enemy.<br />
14% of base mana, Instant cast<br />
<br />
Judgment of Justice<br />
--------------------<br />
Fills the Paladin with the spirit of justice for 2 min, giving each melee attack a chance to stun for 2 sec. Only one Seal can be active on the Paladin at any one time.<br />
Unleashing this Seal's energy will judge an enemy for 20 sec, preventing them from fleeing. Your melee strikes will refresh the spell's duration. Only one Judgement per Paladin can be active at any one time.<br />
100 yd range, Instant<br />
<br />
What I'm inferring from this that the Judgments will only do damage if you have a Seal active. Currently, all 'unleashed' Seals do [ 36% of AP + 1 ] Holy damage, so it doesn't matter which Judgment or Seal you have active, they all do the same damage. Essentially, this looks like a Judgment of Righteousness rolling in to EVERY Judgment .<br />
<br />
What I don't understand on how the current skills read, however, is under each Judgment, you still have the Seal effect. I suppose it very well may be that the skills are not completely updated yet, though, so I'll just have to keep an eye on this.</div></div><hr />

You are not reading it right. The seals are all still there, the Judgement spell is gone. It has been replaced by three separate Judgement spells: Judgement of Wisdom, Judgement of Light, and Judgement of Justice. Judgement of Wisdom still puts the JoW debuff on a mob. Judgement of Light still puts the JoL debuff on, etc.<br />
<br />
Seals now last two minutes, also, instead of 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZerOne</div><div class="date">2008-07-31, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I became extremely confused about the new judgments/sealz myself, thought it looked like a huge nerf for a holy like me using Righteousness.<br />
But seams like it's actually quite a BUFF.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Example 1:<br />
The Paladin runs up to mob and starts attacking with melee weapon.<br />
All 3 Judgement spells are greyed out and unable to be cast.<br />
The Paladin cast Seal of Light.<br />
Seal of Light buff is now active on the Paladin &amp; ALL THREE JUDGEMENTS (Light/Wisdom/Justice) are now available to be cast.<br />
The Paladin chooses to cast Judgement of WISDOM - three things happen:<br />
1) Seal of LIGHT stays active on the Paladin.<br />
2) Judgement of WISDOM DEBUFF is put on the mob.<br />
3) Mob takes base Holy damage from Judgement spell.<br />
<br />
End result: Paladin has Seal of Light's health-regen-on-attack buff, and the mob has Judgement of Wisdom's mana-regen-on-attack Debuff. (Meaning the Paladin is receiving both health and mana back on attack.)<br />
<br />
Example 2:<br />
The Paladin runs up to mob and starts attacking with melee weapon.<br />
All 3 Judgement spells are greyed out and unable to be cast.<br />
The Paladin cast Seal of Vengeance/Corruption.<br />
Seal of Vengeance/Corruption buff is now active on the Paladin &amp; ALL THREE JUDGEMENTS (Light/Wisdom/Justice) are now available to be cast.<br />
STACKING SoV/C DEBUFF is placed on the mob next swing doing holy damage over time.<br />
The Paladin chooses to cast Judgement of WISDOM - three things happen:<br />
1) Seal of Vengeance/Corruption stays active on the Paladin.<br />
2) Judgement of WISDOM DEBUFF is put on the mob IN ADDITION TO THE STACKING SoV/C DEBUFF.<br />
3) Mob takes Holy damage from Judgement spell, which is INCREASED by the Seal having an &quot;on Judgement&quot; damage modifier.<br />
<br />
End result: The mob now has Seal of Vengeance/Corruption's stacking Holy DoT AND Judgement of Wisdom's mana-regen-on-attack Debuff. (This is NOT a bug as the Seals and Judgements are now separate spells and have their own Debuffs.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically as I understand it now, Righteousness now works like before except it scales with attack power besides spell power, it doesn't need to be recast after judging a enemy and when judging it I can chose to get one of 3 additional debuff effects on target beside todays dmg.<br />
SWEET!<br />
<br />
Although making judgments RANGED attacks is less good for a holy like me, making all my holy crit chance and spell hit useless for criting and hitting with judgement. Or did I not get that one right? (someone please help confirm that!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is the way I have understood it. But looking at what Clasifyd wrote it migth be that JoJ dosn't do any extra damage compared to the other Judgements. I'm sure I read that it did in some post, but I don't have a source for it. The abilities are up for change every build almost, so it might have changed since I read that post. But that is basically how it is working.<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm not in the beta myself so unfortunatly I can't verify this myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the effect is really that it still costs a gcd to judge (if you count the re-seal as part of judging), but you dont have to pay mana for reapplying the seal more than once every 2min.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seals always were in GCD. Judgement wasn't. Then on the other hand, Judgement didn't scale and it also needed the seal re-cast.<br />
<br />
Now, Judgement is a 10 yard (30 yards with deep holy talent) STRIKE attack. A ranged instant strike. That does a useful debuff.<br />
<br />
So, we went from ONE strike per 10s to THREE. Also, in reality, Judgement now has a shorter GCD, since the GCD for a Judgement used to be 1.5s + delay for the game to realize the Judgement didn't have a CD.<br />
<br />
P.S. You did see that Seals are now 2 minute and doesn't get consumed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is correct. It's effectively placing a 'shared cooldown' on our 'invincibility' buttons to prevent us from being ridiculously OP, i.e. Chain-using Divine Shield, Divine Protection, and Hand of Protection. Since Avenging Wrath no longer suffers from Forbearance, this shouldn't matter a lot. It's just keeping us Pallys from being God-like. <br />
<br />
I cannot say whether you can use HoP on yourself, as I'm not in beta. The spell text reads &quot;Places a Hand on targeted party member&quot;. I would assume that since you are indeed in the party, you can cast it on yourself. HoP is indeed effected by Forbearance, however.</div></div><hr />

In terms of gameplay mechanics:<br />
-Less Mana Cost (seals only last 2 minutes and do not need reapplying after judging them)<br />
-Always have a utility judgement up<br />
-More Damage (Every judgement now does damage)<br />
<br />
So for an example,<br />
-You Attack an enemy.<br />
-Cast Seal of Command<br />
-Now that a seal is active the Three Judgements are available<br />
-You use Judgement of Wisdom<br />
-The Judgement strikes the target for a base amount of Holy Damage which is modified by seal of command being up. It also places the Judgement of Wisdom debuff on the target and if you have the talent Increases the critical strike chance against the target by 3%.<br />
-The Judgement DOES NOT consume the seal so you do not have to recast it<br />
-Targets have a chance of regaining mana whenever they hit the target<br />
-You can continue to recast Judgement of wisdom every 8/10 seconds for two minutes until your seal of command expires.<br />
<br />
Alternative Example<br />
-If you cast seal of wisdom<br />
-Every time you Strike the target you can gain mana<br />
-Now that a seal is active the Three Judgements are available<br />
-You use Judgement of Wisdom<br />
-The Judgement strikes the target for a base amount of Holy Damage. It also places the Judgement of Wisdom debuff on the target and if you have the talent Increases the critical strike chance against the target by 3%.<br />
-The Judgement DOES NOT consume the seal so you do not have to recast it<br />
-Targets have a chance of regaining mana whenever they hit the target<br />
-You can continue to recast Judgement of wisdom every 8/10 seconds for two minutes until your seal of wisdom expires.<br />
<br />
In terms of gameplay mechanics:<br />
-Less Mana Cost (seals only last 2 minutes and do not need reapplying after judging them)<br />
-Always have a utility judgement up<br />
-More Damage (Every judgement now does damage)<br />
<br />
So we have lost nothing from this. The whole system has been streamlined, the only thing that needs to be changed now is the judgement renew effect of crusader strike as it is no longer needed. Maybe it could be changed to new your active seal so it never needs to be reapplied.<br />
<br />
As far as the Coefficients go its a bit hard to say at the moment but generally all the abilities are a bit pumped up at the moment which is hardly suprising given all the classes mechanic changes</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it scales from attack power if you are spected for it, from the new talent: Sheath of Light:Increases your spell power by an amount equal to 30% of your attack power and your critical healing spells heal the target for 60% of the healed amount over 12 seconds.</div></div><hr />

Not talking about retribution; protection. I know we gain 30% of our stamina as spell power (deep prot talent), but my question is which should a tankadin focus on more? What are the coefficients? Will consecration, the primary tanking threat production spell, still be primarily spell power, with a touch of AP for ret-use? Or is it more AP-focused, making all my spell damage plate worthless?</div></div><hr />

The higher coefficient should be applied.</div></div><hr />

I may have to disagree with this. As I stated before, not in the beta, so I can't test. However, if it takes the 'higher' stat, but prot pallys are supposed to be sharing gear with warriors in the expansion, why are they giving us a talent DEEP in protection to increase spellpower? In my completely unprofessional opinion, it will be a mix between both of these stats. One may be weighted higher than the other (I'm thinking SP, most likely), but I believe they will both play a part.</div></div><hr />

Seal of Righteousness - Attack dmg: 5% AP + 10% SP - Judging dmg: 45% AP + 73% SP<br />

And YES, it uses BOTH.<br />

I am still questioning if Judgements are using ranged hit and crit. Sound silly silly silly to me and I hope i just misread the patchnotes.</div></div><hr />

Fantastic, exactly what I'm looking for. Changes to Holy Shield, Avenger's Shield, or consecration? Coefficients? And where did you snag this info? Oh, and won't ranged hit/crit be the same as melee hit/crit and spell hit/crit? It's all bundled up now, neh?<br />

<br />
As far as I can tell for Consecration (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?spell=48819) it uses 4% SP + 4% AP, Holy Shield (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?spell=48952) is a static 211 holy dmg (?) and Avenger's Shield (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?spell=48827) uses 7% SP + 7% AP<br />

<br />
Hit Rating, Critical Strike Rating, and Haste Rating now modify both melee attacks and spells.<br />
My concern however still is somewhat present since as Holy we have &quot;Holy Power&quot; talent that effect crit of only holy spells. Judgements are classed as a Holy school but will use range crit? Just is so confusing.</div></div><hr />

Aww, we weren't ignoring you. It was just really hard to see the WotLKWiki mention at the top of the quote box; skimmed right past it. I did take your advice and hopped on over there when I saw your latest comment, though. I hadn't even noticed the new 'Sacred Shield' spell before that, so I have to thank you again!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Landriff</div><div class="date">2008-07-31, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only thing that needs to be changed now is the judgement renew effect of crusader strike as it is no longer needed<br />
Uh, are you kidding? They still run out every 20 seconds if not re-judged, and I'm guessing any holy paladins in the raid aren't going to have the time to run into the oft-dangerous melee range of any mobs and rejudge everything they have. Of course, if they spend the talents on increasing their judgement range, they could burn through their mana keeping a judgement up with no retribution paladins in the raid.<br />
<br />
Also, about having 3 judgements: Awesome. All of the debuff judgements are now separated and you can choose which one you want applied regardless of which seal you're using. The main problem here is now one of the vital paladin ability buttons is broken into 3. I already had like 5 hotbars full of all the skills I would probably need to use as a holy paladin and now I can look forward to adding two more buttons to the mix. At least they fixed the problem we used to have where you'd need to keep every rank of every blessing on your hotbars if you wanted to bless the lower-level newbs.<br />
<br />
On seals not being removed: It's about time Blizzard fixed one of the most broken combat systems in the game which has been around for just about forever.<br />
<br />
On attack power / spell power affecting most of our skills now: Awesome. Another thing that should have been fixed years ago. :0)<br />
Still would like to see some scaling in terms of blessings, especially Blessing of Sanctuary, which becomes more and more useless as people gear up, especially now that raid sizes have been cut down significantly and you have less paladins to cast the &quot;necessary&quot; blessings. On the plus side of this issue, however, is the fact that Blessing of Light and Blessing of Salvation have disappeared/been reworked. But still, in a raid with 2 paladins, warriors will still get Kings/Might over Blessing of Sanctuary (and maybe paladins too). Blessing of Sacrifice (now Hand of Sacrifice) was fixed to work percentage-wise. Now let's see more buffs follow suit and slightly boost with the caster's gear upgrading.</div></div><hr />

All Judgement spells are considered ranged attacks for purposes of how they hit and how they critically hit. All cause damage based on attack power and spell power. <br />
<br />
With only 1 kind of hit rating this will affect mostly holy, but they get 4% from talents for judgements, we will have to see how it pans out. The crit part is debatable, yes, it will be nice to hit for more, but you are probably judging for wisdom or light, not the seal or damage effect, so crit would be a bonus. At least that is my take on it...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- Seal of Righteousness deals damage based on weapons peed plus an amount based on attack power and spell power, increases Judgement damage by 25%.<br />
<br />
They really need to fix that mistake...<br />
<br />
I play mostly prot on my paladin, but it seems I might give the other trees a try when WotLK hits. Yeah, they changed the class around, but I like what I see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Roughly talking, AOE type abilities scale better from spell power and single target scales better from strength. The reason I write strength is that strength gives a significant amount of block value, something that benefits the single-target threat of Shield of the Righteous quite heavily. Also, 1 STR = 2.30 AP.<br />
<br />
Expect tweaks to be leaning towards weapon damage and strength more than spell power. Spell power speccing is to improve threat, not to get some in the first place.</div></div><hr />
