World of Warcraft Now Includes Warlords<br />
Warlords of Draenor was added to World of Warcraft on Tuesday. We took a similar approach with the previous expansion prior to the launch of Warlords of Draenor, and the response was very positive. This makes it easier than ever for new players interested in the upcoming Legion expansion to get into the game, and gives returning players a chance to catch up on content prior to the new expansion’s launch.<br />
<br />
Level 90 character boosts are no longer available (though players who purchased Warlords of Draenor prior to this change this will still be able to claim the included boost). Players who want to boost a character can either pre-purchase Legion, which includes a level 100 boost, or purchase a standalone level 100 boost.<br />
<br />
Forgive me if this sounds dense, but I purchased the chest, including all games up to Pandaria. Does this mean that I can now continue into Draenor, or does it mean that anyone that NOW buys the chest gets WoD as well?<br />
You should be able to continue into Draenor and to 100. You just won't have a 90 boost to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recent Actions Against Botting in WoW<br />
We’ve recently taken action against thousands of World of Warcraft accounts that were found to be using third-party programs that automate gameplay, known as “bots.” We’re committed to providing an equal and fair playing field for everyone in World of Warcraft, and will continue to take action against those found in violation of our Terms of Use. Cheating of any form will not be tolerated.<br />
<br />
If you believe that you’ve encountered a player abusing a bot, exploit, or cheat, please let us know! You can do so by using the right-click report functionality in the game, and/or by emailing information to hacks@blizzard.com. <br />
<br />
<br />
Free BattleTag Change<br />
As we prepare for the launch of Overwatch next week, we have refreshed the free BattleTag update for all Battle.net accounts! We often see feedback with requests to update your BattleTag, and as we move into a new universe filled with soldiers, scientists, adventurers and oddities it’s important that you have a nickname that represents you!<br />
<br />
Like your current moniker? No problem! You will continue to keep and use your existing BattleTag without needing to take any action. Want to change it up? Visit your Account Management Dashboard (http://battle.net/account/), and click the Change link under your Account Details to the right of your existing BattleTag! Players on your Battle.net Friends List, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, and Overwatch will see the update soon after the change.<br />
<br />
In addition to the above update, requests for an option to update BattleTags more frequently is something we hear often from players. We’re exploring the possibilities, and will be sure to let you know of any updates! Keep an eye on our game sites and forums for announcements.<br />
<br />
It won’t be long before the agents of Overwatch are recalled to active duty, and we hope that this update helps you get ready!<br />
<br />

Flaskataur - Legendary Items<br />
Did they remove Flaskataur from beta? Been spamming a target macro in SW and Dalaran and have yet to find him.<br />
Yes, the Flaskataurs are taking a break to avoid skewing tuning and rewards feedback across the game as a whole. They'll be returning later on in the beta. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/410778-feedback-legendaries/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743814202?page=7#125))<br />

Restoration Druid -- Legion Beta Feedback<br />
Resto's feral affinity needs help in the form of letting us hit more buttons more often. A straight up energy regen buff would do wonders for this.<br />
We added this recently--you'll see it in either this build or next build. It may not be in the tooltip, so mentioning it now in case people want to try it out. The Feral Affinity version of Swipe was also buffed.<br />
<br />
A cap on mastery stacking is a possibility for eventual tuning, but is not added in this build. The discussion about it is still germane.<br />
<br />
Followup on this--beta has a bug where the bonus Agility that Resto and Balance Druids get in Cat Form (Killer Instinct) isn't applying. So if you try to use Feral Affinity right now your damage might be very low; we'll hotfix this to beta.

Is Void Storage being removed at the same time as Wardrobe arrives, do we need to empty it into our bags before the pre patch?<br />
Void Storage is not being removed. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/730558691619938304))<br />
<br />
Do I need to stockpile brawler's guild shirts, or will there be a window when the brawler's guild and transmog system overlap?<br />
You don’t have to keep them. If you dispose of them today, they’ll be in Wardrobe, since they're quest rewards. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/730933652083740672))<br />

Pets and Pet Battles<br />
Did we ever determine if Pet Battle World Quests are account-wide or not? Can I complete set of 3 on toon A and then do it again on toon B?<br />
Currently, they are not. Subject to change based on feedback. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/731216614297718784))<br />

<br />
Because LotR was mostly costumes, orcs were all people in fantasy looking masks/prosthetic make-up, the only full cgi character was Gollum. This movie is like 90% CGI. Add to that the fact that warcraft characters in general are more fairy tale like and that they don't actually look in the movie like you're used to from the games and you've got some unrealistic looking stuff.<br />
<br />
Technologically, it's much more advanced, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a better looking, or generally just better, option.</div></div><hr />

All of the early gossip coming out of screening is pretty positive too.<br />

For fucks sake Look at the CGI used in game of thrones even that CGI is worlds better then this straight to dvd garbage this movie uses. Il never get over the fact that Garona looks like all they did was give her fucking dracula costume fangs from the local party city and some cheap body paint. Cool kids on the block my ass.

Interesting opinion. Because to my eye, Jungle book looked incredibly fake. And this... does not. Jungle book is on the same level as Jurassic World. Really obvious, over-dressed silliness. There are a couple of wide-angle shots here where they overdid the blue-orange thing, but it's really not bad. And the skin and hair looks way better than most textures you see nowadays. Are you going to tell me you thought TMNT had better skin than these Orcs? <br />
<br />
Or maybe you think Zootopia had really good CGI. Maybe this whole thing should just be Pixar. Because, like, that's what WoW totally looks like in game.<br />
<br />
Come on. The amount of just sheer complaining for the sake of complaining in this post is just sad. Go home, your drunk.</div></div><hr />

So you rather have 100% cgi modells (like warcraft cinematics) without the motion capture technique they used for the movie oO? Have you actually seen the MOP cinematic human? It looks like garbage. <br />
<br />
WoW-Cinematic style would get this movie down to final fantasy videogame movie level of badness.<br />
<br />
Also funny that you call garonas green skin a cheap body paint when its actually cgi (How is she supposed to look anway? Like the ingame model in WoW where blizzard was too lazy to create a unique model for her and just used the female orc one :p?). And Sam Raimi was trashed because his story sucked.</div></div><hr />

I personally like how it looks kind of like actual WoW. It's not LoTR, it is a particular stylized version of the warcraft universe. If the story is good, and has good character development, I will love it. If its cheesy like the Seventh Son, it's going to suck...</div></div><hr />

This.<br />
<br />
The goal was not to make a &quot;Video Game Movie&quot; -- Those suck and fail.<br />
<br />
The goal was to make a fantasy summer blockbuster (which do very well, typically), using the Warcraft source material.<br />
<br />
There is no WoW in this movie. At all. So just stop right there. WoW comes roughly 30-40 years after this. You won't see any of &quot;WoW&quot; in any movie until after.... Warcraft II: The Second War, Warcraft III: Thrall: Slave to Warchief, Warcraft IV: Rise of the Lich King, Warcraft V: Battle for Mount Hyjall (or Return of the Guardian), and MAYBE... depending on the fan-base.... such exciting spin-offs as... Warcraft: The Corruption of Grim Batol, or Warcraft: War of the Ancients.<br />
<br />
Short story? Warcraft has PLENTY of lore in a well developed universe that is ripe for a long and fruitful franchise in the cinema world.</div></div><hr />

This movie is like 90% CGI. Add to that the fact that warcraft characters in general are more fairy tale like and that they don't actually look in the movie like you're used to from the games and you've got some unrealistic looking stuff.<br />
<br />
Technologically, it's much more advanced, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a better looking, or generally just better, option.<br />
<br />
LoTR had quite a bit of CGI going on with characters, tho - Gimli, the Hobbits, the Balrog, just getting Frodo and Gandalf together on the screen and making it look natural was a big accomplishment for WETA, they did some amazing work that's skipped over, because you don't notice it - which is the sign of great CGI work. <br />
<br />
I've felt the movie looks &quot;off&quot; for a while. I just get a &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; feeling from it. ILM may have done some spectacular work, and the environments are looking pretty spectacular, but how the movie is looking just doesnt feel &quot;right&quot; to me. <br />
<br />
When the Nazrul attacked in LOTR, it felt &quot;right&quot;. They're fantasy creatures that don't exist, but they felt organic to the movie's universe. <br />
<br />
Something about the Warcraft footage feels off. Maybe it's that the humans look to flat compared to the highly exaggerated orcs and their impossible bodies and proportions. More than one person has commented how the human scenes look like a cheap made for tv movie. Maybe it's the camera lenses and angles Jones chose. Each piece, taken separately, look find - the orcs look fine on their own. The environments look fine. The humans look fine. But add them all together, and it just feels....not right. <br />
<br />
I'm willing to consider that it may be better in the full movie, as our eyes will grow accustomed to it all as the movie plays out. Maybe not. But so far, I'm reacting to the trailers like I have to a lot of movies that turned out to be bad. My instincts are saying &quot;bad&quot;. <br />

Same thing with GTA 5, they try for this realistic look...<br />
<br />
It still looks like a cartoon! Give... It... Up.<br />
<br />
So what this movie Warcraft does, and some new games: they map video source, not textures, which is real. Plus the mappingand tracking is better.<br />
<br />
It makes a big difference. Less cartoony Orcs... Its hard to explain, but its the best realistic look right now.</div></div><hr />

Right, because it's either one end of the spectrum or the other. They could have cast at least one A-list actor. And you're missing the point to begin with, someone not knowing these actors isn't shocking. Most of them haven't been in many things that are all that good, or all that widely seen. And don't say Vikings, because that show is mediocre at best.</div></div><hr />

But the more I see, the more I'm encouraged. I think we all need to step back and take a look at this a little more objectively. Frankly, we're all going to be a little too invested in the source material to see it clearly. Put it like this... Have you ever watched a family member or close friend perform in front of an audience and cringe when they make even minor mistakes? It's like you want so much for them to succeed that when things aren't flawless you really notice. I think the same is going to be true for those of us as fans. Is this movie going to be the best movie of the year? probably not. But I think if we relax a little bit, it can be an enjoyable movie.

OK, I have to comment on this...<br />
<br />
The Blizzard cinematics take at least a year to produce, if not more. Sure, it's a smaller team than a feature length film would have, but we're talking about &quot;minutes&quot; of footage compared to hours. If Blizzard were to make a full length film using their cinematics team, it would take 25 years (5 mins of film per year times 25 years = 125mins = 2+ hours).</div></div><hr />

Actually, having watched a documentary on that and how they did, a LOT of the size difference wasn't CGI it was angles, mirrors, glass, old cinema tricks. They wanted to use a little cgi as possible going into, think they even said it added a lot of stress to the actors. Ofc some things HAD to be cgi, but they only used it where needed.<br />

They give out these pitiful 6 month bans in 6 month waves which means these people buy a ton of accounts when the $5 sale is on. They can have bots farming shit for them and if an account gets shot they load up another for the next 6 months and when that gets banned they can just load up the old ones that are just coming off the 6 month prior ban.<br />

<br />
1) Why are there Quel'dorei seated at Stormwind Keep? Dwarves are not explicitly mentioned in Last Guardian (that I remember), but since the Orcs invaded well in to Dun Morough, Grim Batol, Blackrock Mountain, etc, so I know it makes sense for them to be there. But High Elves? Why would they be this far south? I didn't think the Orc problem was of any import to them until the Second War. Heck, Lordaeron wasn't even convinced the rumors of the First War were TRUE until the refugees hit Southshore.<br />
<br />
2) Whereas Trolls actually are mentioned in the jungles of Stranglethorn -- specifically Vol'Jin and his scarf -- and were allies of the Orcish Horde prior to the Sacking of Stormwind.... yet I see no evidence they made it in to the film.<br />
<br />
Both of these are extremely minor points that I don't reeealy care about.... far less important than Draenei being present on Draenor.... But I thought I'd bring them up for discussion (and try to move the conversation away from the CGI garbage rehash).<br />
<br />
Also, where do you think it will end? Llane and Durotan have been stated as the &quot;equal and opposite&quot; driving forces, so I presume the final moments will be their respective deaths.... Possibly some sad choral line with Stormwind burning, Ogrim distressed with a leader's burden, and the twin imagery of Thrall in a basket and Varian on a refugee boat???</div></div><hr />

Dwarves are not explicitly mentioned in Last Guardian (that I remember), but since the Orcs invaded well in to Dun Morough, Grim Batol, Blackrock Mountain, etc, so I know it makes sense for them to be there. But High Elves? Why would they be this far south? I didn't think the Orc problem was of any import to them until the Second War. Heck, Lordaeron wasn't even convinced the rumors of the First War were TRUE until the refugees hit Southshore.<br />
<br />
2) Whereas Trolls actually are mentioned in the jungles of Stranglethorn -- specifically Vol'Jin and his scarf -- and were allies of the Orcish Horde prior to the Sacking of Stormwind.... yet I see no evidence they made it in to the film.<br />
<br />
Both of these are extremely minor points that I don't reeealy care about.... far less important than Draenei being present on Draenor.... But I thought I'd bring them up for discussion (and try to move the conversation away from the CGI garbage rehash).<br />
<br />
Also, where do you think it will end? Llane and Durotan have been stated as the &quot;equal and opposite&quot; driving forces, so I presume the final moments will be their respective deaths.... Possibly some sad choral line with Stormwind burning, Ogrim distressed with a leader's burden, and the twin imagery of Thrall in a basket and Varian on a refugee boat???<br />
<br />
<br />
They will not follow the original lore by details,they will make some changes here and there but i think nothing relevant.For example Lothar was originally much older but now he is like a middle age,kinda of.</div></div><hr />

The goal was not to make a &quot;Video Game Movie&quot; -- Those suck and fail.<br />
<br />
The goal was to make a fantasy summer blockbuster (which do very well, typically), using the Warcraft source material.<br />
<br />
There is no WoW in this movie. At all. So just stop right there. WoW comes roughly 30-40 years after this. You won't see any of &quot;WoW&quot; in any movie until after.... Warcraft II: The Second War, Warcraft III: Thrall: Slave to Warchief, Warcraft IV: Rise of the Lich King, Warcraft V: Battle for Mount Hyjall (or Return of the Guardian), and MAYBE... depending on the fan-base.... such exciting spin-offs as... Warcraft: The Corruption of Grim Batol, or Warcraft: War of the Ancients.<br />
<br />
Short story? Warcraft has PLENTY of lore in a well developed universe that is ripe for a long and fruitful franchise in the cinema world.<br />
<br />
Well, they took some WoW elements such as flying Dalaran which didn't happen until WoW.<br />

I love Dominic Cooper...and I know he already admitted he knew nothing about any of the Warcraft lore before signing up...but i got really annoyed when he said he was in charge of the Kingdom of Azeroth. :(<br />
<br />
Makes me feel like they are going to say FOR AZEROTH! instead of FOR LORDAERON!<br />
<br />
<br />
Why would King Llane Wrynn say for Lordaeron? He's the king of Stormwind. That would not make sense. Stormwind was the head of the human nations in Warcraft 1, which makes him the king of the Kingdom of Azeroth as the Eastern Kingdoms is also known as, you know? The planet and the Eastern Kingdoms are &quot;Azeroth&quot;. Lalne would never say for lordaeron since he's not from there or in charge of it...<br />

I'm pretty sure high elves fought in the first war. They were the ranger unit. So, elves are tied to the human nations to a degree, just not as much as they would be in the Second and Third War.<br />

Nope. Second War. The original Warcraft was purely Orcs and Humans (and demons). Warcraft II introduced Elves and Gnomes to the Alliance (no Dwarves until Warcraft III I believe) and Trolls, Ogres and Goblins for the Horde.</div></div><hr />

The Blizzard cinematics take at least a year to produce, if not more. Sure, it's a smaller team than a feature length film would have, but we're talking about &quot;minutes&quot; of footage compared to hours. If Blizzard were to make a full length film using their cinematics team, it would take 25 years (5 mins of film per year times 25 years = 125mins = 2+ hours).<br />
<br />
BS.<br />
<br />
Square Enix, a company is that nearly broke, could create FFVII: Advent Children. You are telling me Blizzard with their billions can't do a CGI movie.<br />

The scenes that are full CGI look just fine -only Orcs on screen, for example. Ironically, the moment I see a frame with live action (props or actors even) I die a little inside -the filters, lighting whatever do not look convincing and very amateur.</div></div><hr />

The earliest clips we saw did look off to me too; however, these latest ones look good and so I'm hoping they look very good on a large theater screen. Also, these latest clips show more of the Alliance story which was missing from the earlier clips which made it look like an orc movie with humans along as ballast. I'm very hopeful that this movie will be very good and we can have sequels. The humans fit in the scenes just fine in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

You realize a lot of their players are mostly FF fans and people coming from 11 as well yeah? Don't make it sound like that FF14 took a load of WoW subs because it sure as shit didn't.

Actually for a heavy CGI movie it is not too much...especially with promotions (wiki says $160, but even that not too much)and based on the pathetic mistakes with the advertising (white skinned Garona and so on) yes they are cheapskates...<br />
And that 2 mentioned actors are not a great deal..Don`t get me wrong, I like them, but they are nowhere compared to an AAA name (as &quot;puller&quot; names)</div></div><hr />

Garona - Mission Impossible<br />
Medivh - X Men<br />
King Llane - Need for Speed<br />
Durotan - Fantastic 4, Planet of the Apes, Wrath of the Titans etc<br />

Legendary?s Warcraft is a 3D epic adventure of world-colliding conflict based upon Blizzard Entertainment?s globally-renowned universe. Directed by Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code), written by Charles Leavitt with a rewrite by Duncan Jones. The film, a Legendary Pictures, Blizzard Entertainment and Atlas Entertainment production, is produced by Charles Roven, Thomas Tull, Jon Jashni and Alex Gartner. Stuart Fenegan, Jillian Share, Brent O?Connor, and Blizzard Entertainment?s Michael Morhaime and Paul Sams serve as executive producers. Rob Pardo and Blizzard Entertainment?s Chris Metzen and Nick Carpenter co‐produce with Atlas?s Rebecca Steel Roven.<br />

Their involvement is a little more than the rights and the name. Blizzard has a financial stake in this. Don't forget, Legendary didn't approach Blizzard with the idea, Blizzard was shopping the movie idea around for years, and chose Legendary to form a production company to make the movie with. Atlas came in later, and Universal last of all - the film will be labeled as an &quot;Atlas/Blizzard/Legendary/Universal&quot; production. <br />
<br />
While it is true, Legendary is doing the heavy lifting with Atlas, actually hiring people and buildings sets and producing footage, trust me in that Blizzard has contributed a lot more than the rights and idea. The Blizzard guys are most likely not working on the movie on a day to day basis, but I'd bet they've invested a significant amount of time into the project, along with their financial investment.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget, Legendary didn't approach Blizzard with the idea, Blizzard was shopping the movie idea around for years, and chose Legendary to form a production company to make the movie with. Atlas came in later, and Universal last of all - the film will be labeled as an &quot;Atlas/Blizzard/Legendary/Universal&quot; production. <br />
<br />
While it is true, Legendary is doing the heavy lifting with Atlas, actually hiring people and buildings sets and producing footage, trust me in that Blizzard has contributed a lot more than the rights and idea. The Blizzard guys are most likely not working on the movie on a day to day basis, but I'd bet they've invested a significant amount of time into the project, along with their financial investment.<br />

Blizzard's &quot;sole contribution&quot;? Not true, because they're listed as one of the production companies. <br />
<br />
Again, who funded the movie and who will get the receipts from sales? Is Blizz on the hook to Legendary and Tencent Pictures for whatever percentage of funding they contributed, etc.?<br />
<br />
Of course Blizz is not a movie producer so they've hired out much of the work to get it made. Don't try to say that if the thing stinks, it's not Blizzard's fault.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it's actually been a very long while since you've seen LOTR, and you forget that any scene where the hobbits are standing near other people looks fake as shit. Go back and watch when all of Gondor bows to the hobbits. And tell me that looks real. You can't, because it's glaringly obvious. You just overlook it because it's god damned lord of the rings. This thread is made entirely of whiny babies who don't understand that when CGI isn't used just to save money, it's the reason we have the kinds of movies we have today.</div></div><hr />

Legendary Pictures is shown to be the funding source.<br />

What's wrong with your reading comprehension. Read down the list to see Blizzard's participation as well as the contributions of the others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Nope. <br />
<br />
Legendary is shown only to be one source of funding among others which must also include Blizz, and what you posted is not specific as to how much, what percentage, or if Blizz is on the hook to pay it back, (i.e., an advance against projected future sales) and so on. It's vague and says nothing about what deals or agreements have been made.<br />
<br />
You've proved nothing but that you're looking for excuses for Blizz.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">saywhat</div><div class="date">2016-05-23, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I have to comment on this...<br />
<br />
The Blizzard cinematics take at least a year to produce, if not more. Sure, it's a smaller team than a feature length film would have, but we're talking about &quot;minutes&quot; of footage compared to hours. If Blizzard were to make a full length film using their cinematics team, it would take 25 years (5 mins of film per year times 25 years = 125mins = 2+ hours).<br />
<br />
You know whats strange with that argument? How they pump out all those CGI shorts for Overwatch in no time... ofc they are preproduced and released in bulk just now, but its still alot of material, which kinda still contradicts their statement of not being able to do them faster.<br />
<br />
And regarding the whole movie CGI quality discussion.. you guys are really missing the point. Blizz is keeping the specs down, so it plays flawlessly even on older PCs. ;)</div></div><hr />

This movie looks freaking awesome and those who are bashing on the use of CGI are doing it just so they can be on that bandwagon with the &quot;cool kids.&quot;<br />

<br />
I'm pretty sure those CGI shorts were either started a year ago, or were made entirely with the game engine.<br />
<br />
Nice joke about the specs. Honestly I'm not jarred by the CGI in this movie at all. I actually prefer it to what we got with Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.</div></div><hr />
