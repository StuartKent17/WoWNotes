World First Glory of the Cataclysm Raider by Immersion<br />
Wait ... what? World first? Yeah. Blizzard had a point when they said that a lot of players aren't finished with the content yet, Immersion (http://www.immersion-guild.com/) (EU - Auchindoun) was the first guild in the world to complete Glory of the Cataclysm Raider (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4853/glory-of-the-cataclysm-raider/)! Congratulations to them, they also released a video of their strategy for Keeping it in the Family (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4849/keeping-it-in-the-family/) in Blackwing Descent. <br />

Patch 4.1 Features<br />
The point isn't really that we're delaying Firelands so we can release ZA/ZG instead, or because we don't think players are ready for a new raid. Our messaging on the subject directly implies this, and that's our fault.<br />
<br />
What we're really saying is that we want more frequent, slightly smaller updates to the game so that content keeps coming. Since Firelands isn't quite ready yet, we've made the decision not to hold back the other 4.1 patch content for it. Instead, we're going to release patch 4.1 with the content that's ready to go so the majority of players have more things to do, while also putting some finishing touches on Firelands so we can ship it out in 4.2 shortly thereafter. We're not arbitrarily holding back Firelands. On the contrary, we don't want to hold back other content updates for Firelands.<br />
<br />
The main content features currently planned for 4.1 are:<br />
<br />
<br />
Zul'Gurub revamp<br />
Zul'Aman revamp<br />
New level-85 Stranglethorn quest line (phased) leading players into the troll dungeons<br />
New tier of Heroic dungeon gear (epic item level 353) to give players a slightly bigger boost going into raids for the first time<br />
New &amp; updated flavor items, vanity pets, and mounts<br />
Guild Challenges (new guild quests)<br />
<br />
<br />
All of this is in addition to a number of UI improvements, class balance changes, and more. We'll have more information on the patch 4.1 features coming soon. :D <br />

Patch 4.2<br />
Conversion from Valor to Justice Points + Arena Season - Patch 4.2<br />
The conversion from Valor to Justice Points, as well as the release of the next Arena season, won't happen until the release of 4.2. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161923/42-justice-point-gear))<br />
<br />
Patch 4.1<br />
Why are Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman heroic instances?<br />
We thought about different ways to fit in a normal tier of these dungeons, but in the end it just didn't feel right. We wouldn't want to make normal versions of these dungeons award current Heroic level loot, but there aren't really any good places in between to stick a normal dungeon tier.<br />
<br />
We feel the best solution for patch 4.1 progression is: level-85 normal dungeons, Heroic dungeons, ZA/ZG Heroics, raids.<br />
<br />
ZA and ZG will drop gear for just about every slot as well, but we're really trying to focus on dropping items for slots that have been hard to fill in the current Heroics. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/162139/b-b-butthe-raid-content))<br />
<br />
Archaeology and Edge of Madness in Patch 4.1<br />
I don't have any specifics to share at the moment, save for one I think is cool. Those with the appropriate Archaeology skill will be able to unlock one of four additional bosses (chosen randomly) for their group in Zul'Gurub. These bosses were previously known as part of the Edge of Madness. The four bosses will share some loot, but also have some loot unique to each of them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/162139/b-b-butthe-raid-content))<br />
<br />
&quot;Missing&quot; pre-raid items in ZA/ZG<br />
I believe that (ranged slot for DPS warriors) was specifically brought up in a meeting I had last week. We want to get some items out there that are currently missing, even if it's because they're only useful to a small number of classes/specs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/162139/b-b-butthe-raid-content))<br />
<br />
Guild Challenges (new guild quests)<br />
We're preparing all of the information on this new feature for you. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/162139/b-b-butthe-raid-content))<br />
<br />
Daily quest hub in Mount Hyjal<br />
There are plans for a new daily quest hub in Mount Hyjal to be released in conjunction with the Firelands raid. We're planning to make it phase and unlock more content as players progress, very similar to Isle of Quel'Danas. One downside of the phasing and unlocking of new buildings/quests there though, was that you had to be participating during the world event to actually see the change take place. We'd like to make the Mount Hyjal hub phase per player so that your personal progress unlocks new content for you, rather than for your whole realm.<br />
<br />
We'll have more details about that a little later though. ;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161854/tone-down-tol-barad-dailies))<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
Graveyard camping in Warsong Gulch fixed in Patch 4.1<br />
The days of graveyard camping in Warsong Gulch may be coming to an end soon, thanks to some new plans we have in store for the battleground in patch 4.1:<br />
<br />
We are moving the graveyards to their own terrain level, preventing camping by members of the opposing team.<br />
<br />
However, this will also serve another purpose; players will no longer be able to respawn and run straight back into their flag room. They will either have to drop down then run up the tunnel, or go around the top of the base. This adds around 20 seconds to the journey from the graveyard to the flag room. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161733/graveyard-camping-in-bgs))<br />
<br />
Tol Barad<br />
Tol Barad quests balance<br />
The rewards and benefits for doing Tol Barad quests are quite nice. Players jumping straight into the zone when hitting 85 (either in quest greens or some dungeon blues) will certainly notice it's substantially more challenging than Twilight Highlands.<br />
<br />
The balance of the zone partially relates to its sustainability as repeatable content for players at all levels of the end game. When I first started questing there I was in all questing gear and definitely noticed the challenge, but I liked it. As I started gearing up I saw how much better I was faring while taking high damage, managing unpredictable spawns, etc.<br />
<br />
The basic point is that, because there are some great rewards there a lot of players are working toward, the questing needs to be more difficult than a place like Twilight Highlands so it doesn't feel incredibly trivial by the time you have a 329 average item level. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161854/tone-down-tol-barad-dailies))<br />
<br />
Instant respawns in Tol Barad<br />
It is sort of a catch 22 and a side effect of dynamic spawning. When there are a finite number of spawn points for certain creature types, and the rate of spawning is determined by the number of players in the area, this can lead to instant respawns at specific locations. We still feel that's preferable to set spawn times regardless of player population in the area.<br />
<br />
I know I'd rather have a few creatures spawn on top of me and have to prepare for that potential outcome, than camp out and really fight with nearby players to get my quests done. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161854/tone-down-tol-barad-dailies))<br />
<br />
Is Tol Barad too small?<br />
We didn't decide on the size of the two zones because it would have been more difficult to make the areas larger.<br />
<br />
I totally get players' points about the area feeling cramped. I can understand how many players would feel that way, particularly on PvP realms. At the same time though, I think if we spaced everything out according to what players are asking for in this thread, we'd see at least an equivalent number of complaints about how the distance between all questing points of interest is too far -- that traveling around the zones to quest just takes forever on land mounts.<br />
<br />
We tried to find a happy medium so that everything doesn't feel insanely far away, but doesn't feel insanely cramped either. As it stands, it doesn't take long to get around, but the size allows for a little interesting chaos. We're not trying to make things overly difficult or elitist, but we don't want everyone to be on full auto-pilot while doing dailies.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..deathknight) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1116-Death-Knight-Cataclysm))<br />
Death Strike<br />
Are you content with the power contained by DS? Right now, that ability accounts for our block and a portion of our armor. Is the design goal of blood to use DS over anything else?<br />
Death Strike is a centerpiece of the Blood Deathknight arsenal. It’s your core strike, and we expect that’s where most of your runes go. Still, it's easy to over-simplify the mitigation picture. Mitigation is always important for a tank, but its value also varies according to the scenario you're facing. If you’re tanking a hard-hitting boss, or a pack of heavy-hitting lieutenant elites in a dungeon, then survival and minimizing damage are definitely top concerns, and Death Strike is crucial there. But there are plenty of tanking situations where you're not in any danger of suddenly dropping dead from a huge damage spike. You might be rounding up loose mobs, for example, or trying to get very solid aggro on something that needs to be DPS’ed hard. In those cases, using other abilities might help you meet the objective more efficiently, and doing so involves making effective choices as the situation demands. (Source[/u<br />
<br />
Blood Shield<br />
Are you content with the timing constraints on a DK? Premature DS can mean a significant block loss, does the fact that DKs are using a mod to try to guess their shields match your goals? Do you feel that Blood has to pay an overly large amount of attention to their resources to maintain their mitigation?<br />
We changed Blood Shield to stack cumulatively in 4.0.6 to help ease these constraints. ([url=http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161682/blood-what-is-the-developers-design-goal]Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161682/blood-what-is-the-developers-design-goal))<br />
<br />
Death Knight &quot;punishing&quot; rotations<br />
Are you content with the punishment for errors in the DK rotation? DKs that mis-spend a F/U rune are out a descent amount of mitigation. Do you envision mistakes costing DKs that much?<br />
We’re okay with the way this works out. The deathknight class isn't innately easy to play. We start them at high level and require players to have some familiarity with World of Warcraft (in the form of a higher level character) before they can make one. It's not intended as a class for beginners. That said, while the best DK tank in the world can do some impressive things, we don't expect every player to perform at that level to be a good tank. While it might be challenging to execute perfectly, the rotation is also reasonably forgiving, especially for heroic dungeons and normal raids. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161682/blood-what-is-the-developers-design-goal))<br />
<br />
Death Strike / Diseases<br />
Applying diseases presents a clear danger when you do it by taking runes away from Death Strike, are you content with DKs actively striving not to put up diseases or striving to time them when there is a 0 second grace period?<br />
Outbreak helps with this, and having diseases up helps with threat in general. On the other hand, if you’re specifically in a situation where you've got solid aggro on a mob and you only care about your survival, then it's probably a good idea to prioritize Death Strike over disease reapplication. If you need to handle more than one creature, Pestilence can help by letting you use Blood runes to spread diseases. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161682/blood-what-is-the-developers-design-goal))<br />
<br />
Heart Strike<br />
Are you satisfied with the signature strike (Heart Strike) being on such a low use priority? <br />
Heart Strike a good use of Blood Runes in some situations, so it looks okay for now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161682/blood-what-is-the-developers-design-goal))<br />
<br />
Lichborne<br />
Are you content that DKs are willing to dump 5 talent points for lichborne? Are you content knowing that there is very little to do with the remaining 10 talent points after a DK finishes their talent tree?<br />
There are plenty of utility choices available to DKs in all three trees. If DKs want to invest the talent points in Lichborne to help improve their survivability a bit, then that’s fine. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161682/blood-what-is-the-developers-design-goal))<br />
<br />
Runic Empowerment<br />
We anticipated players sitting on some runes in order to make it more likely that runes they want get refreshed by Runic Empowerment. We don’t mind this behavior as a more advanced strategy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161682/blood-what-is-the-developers-design-goal))<br />
<br />
Blood Tanking<br />
Above all, are you content with the current DK QoL? DKs have been moaning and groaning about a number of things. Many are trivial. Many just want to be heard. Many don't understand what they should be doing. Does the DK tank class feel polished and smooth to you? <br />
We’re pretty happy with Blood tanking overall. Many of the recent changes in 4.0.6 were really just quality of life issues, not overhauls to the core design. The core of Cataclysm Blood design was to take more damage but offset that with more self-healing. That’s not an easy thing to balance, but we think the results have been good overall. We're pleased to see Blood DKs out there successfully tanking all the content. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161682/blood-what-is-the-developers-design-goal))<br />
<br />
100% Shield uptime<br />
If people are trying for 100% shield uptime, youll always feel like you're lacking. In the end, healers are expected to heal something. If they think you need to be at 100% all the time, then they force you into overhealing. If a healer lets you dip down 25%, they would see you're doing a good deal of healing yourself.<br />
That’s a good point. I think what we were really hoping to address is the perception that a death knight tank must use every single Unholy and Frost rune on Death Strike, and game Runic Empowerment procs to generate even more Death Strikes. If you had to do all that to be successful at all, then that would be a problem. The spec isn't designed with that necessity in mind, though. Blood is expected to use (as an estimate, and assuming effective usage) around 6-7 Death Strikes a minute; any additional Death Strikes are helpful of course, but they shouldn't be mandatory. Blood is balanced against the other tanking specs with this assumption in mind. To be fair, one of the drawbacks of the active mitigation that Blood has, contrasted with the passive mitigation of other specs, is that it does require more work - but the trade-off is that death knights have an enviable array of tools to manage incoming damage and promote survivability. That's not to say that those tools must be used flawlessly - the spec is designed around using those tools at an adequate level. We don't generally balance specs around a theoretical maximum; in many cases, those levels aren't achievable by most human players in an actual encounter and only show up in simulations. Instead, we design around what players can reasonably accomplish.<br />
<br />
We also recognize that some of you have concerns about Death Strike overhealing, and that it represents a wasted mastery. We didn't go the route of Death Strike over heals creating a 'bubble', because it seemed that it would create even more pressure to use Death Strike at every conceivable opportunity. Nonetheless, it's not off the table completely, and it's something we might consider for the future.<br />
<br />
On that note, Death Runes are tied to Death Strike to promote flexibility. It’s too easy to allow the discussion to center around a hypothetical Patchwerk style fight without external support debuffs, where threat doesn’t matter, and the only relevant issue is absorbing every single point of damage possible. Tanking is dynamic though, most fights are more complex than that and the situation can change suddenly and require immediate reaction. Adds run in, things get loose, you may need to move out of fire and then silence a ranged caster that didn’t move with you, and so forth. Death Strike is a core ability, as noted, but keeping the runes it generates as Death Runes helps make it more likely that when a complication arises that the tank has the right runes for the job. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161682/blood-what-is-the-developers-design-goal))<br />
<br />
Threat vs Survivability<br />
We're not being forced to choose between threat and survivability. I really don't know of many DK's having threat problems right now (Rune Strike is kinda insane...). What we're being forced to do is choose between surviving the next blow and reducing the bosses damage output for the next x seconds. <br />
When I mentioned diseases earlier, I was addressing the question of trading threat for mitigation. We understand that you need to keep your diseases up for the debuffs they provide. Outbreak does help, but there will also be situations where you might end up skipping a Death Strike to keep diseases up too. In a multi-mob scenario, you can use Blood Runes and accomplish that with Pestilence. In a large raid setting, it if's an issue, then it's pretty likely that the debuffs provided by diseases might be available from other sources, such a Warlock's Curse of Weakness, other DKs, Demoralizing Shout and Thunder Clap, hunter pets, etc. Still, we understand your concerns and that you want to be self sufficient when it comes to applying the debuffs that you need to apply to do the tanking job well, and we'll keep that in mind as we continue to refine the Blood tree. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161682/blood-what-is-the-developers-design-goal))<br />
<br />
Death Knight Tanks concerns<br />
That’s absolutely correct. We are sensitive to your concerns and we're certainly open to improving quality of life for death knight tanks. We recognize and appreciate that you aren’t asking just asking for buffs, but rather playstyle changes. Conversely, some of the feedback being offered (e.g. Blood Runes as Death Runes) would just push DKs towards a state where they spam Death Strike and absolutely nothing else, which we don’t see as an improvement.<br />
<br />
We also recognize that some players are trying to make DK tanking more approachable for new players, which is a noble goal and much appreciated, but we also think that it’s okay for the class to be slightly more complex and challenging to play perfectly given its high-level nature and requirements. Fortunately, you don’t need to play perfectly to be effective. Like I mentioned in the previous set of posts, we see DKs tanking everything from 5-player dungeons to heroic raid content without needing to do so.<br />
<br />
Talent design has been an issue that we've seen expressed as well. Admittedly, Blood-Caked Blade is not a shining exemplar of talent design. Tank trees are quite challenging to design, and all the trees have similar design issues. Talents directly related to survival are mandatory. Talents related to damage output are either mandatory if threat matters, or worthless if it doesn't. Utility talents are either mandatory if they help with control or survivability, unless a bosses are immune to the effect, then they become useless. It's too easy to get a point where when the survivability talents run out and frustration results. We want there to be compelling decisions between talents, but finding that balance is exceptionally difficult, perhaps more-so than for any other role.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warlock) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1125-Warlock-Cataclysm))<br />
Soulstones to become battle rez<br />
Our plan is still to let Soulstones be used on dead targets, effectively giving warlocks a combat resurrection as well. Unlike the death knight one, which was a relatively straight forward change, the warlock one requires new code. We still plan on making this change for 4.1, but we will keep you updated.<br />
<br />
Having lots of unique and powerful abilities is not always compatible with having 10-player raids. We don’t think the smaller raid needs every possible buff or defensive ability to be successful, but we were convinced that the combat rez made groups without a druid at a significant disadvantage. It’s often subjective as to what constitutes mandatory raid tools. In our minds, combat rez has become one. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161839/soulstone))</div></div><hr />

Purely 10 man reasoning.<br />
<br />
The number of times i did 10 man runs in wrath and had no druids. Had a few Dks and locks though.<br />

In a 10 man run, you are not guaranteed to get every class, therefore your not guaranteed every buff or ability. While you could probably get by without Mark of the Wild/Blessing of Kings, I would imagine you would find it hard if you were missing more key abilities like battle res and bloodlust.<br />

I don't get it, what's so difficult about it? You just need to survive 1 more electrocute than usual in the airphase o.0 Never tried it ofc, but I didn't expect it to be the last achievement to be completed.<br />

Why giving such abilities to DPS/Tanks while they have 3 healers without it is a riddle to me. It would make more fictional sense as it does now at least, especially this warlock one. <br />
Seems to me they are trying to make classes look more attractive to get raid spots, but a battle res is not really something you rely on<br />
<br />
In my opinion resurrecting and shit is clearly healers domain or at least on classes which have healing trees - no need to involve non-healers with it.</div></div><hr />

Most guilds figured this one was bugged, but it just required a twist. It's not just getting one more lightning though it's not much more than that. You also have to nuke Nefarian to 64% before he flies up so you pop heroism/bloodlust before the third lightning comes. This means you kill Onyxia as late as possible and nuke the remaining percentages while Nefarian is walking to the middle. You can only dps him 15% of his hp before he lands during the air phase.</div></div><hr />

While the general consensus should be bring the player not the class, in some cases there is no choice since certain classes have abilities you almost cannot do without, and only those classes have them, the only way to avoid this would be to give more classes those abilities so as to truly make it bring the player not the class, since that way no matter what player you bring the ability is still present.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is making steps to lessen this.<br />
<br />
Homogenization is a necessary evil. Or we would be stuck bringing people like that crappy undergeared/underperforming shaman, simply because he has bloodlust.<br />
<br />
constant 17k dps Mage with lust or a 8k dps shaman with lust. Hmm not a hard choice.<br />
constant 16k dps Mage without lust or a 11k dps shaman with lust. Hmm Little harder to call.<br />
<br />
<br />
Purely examples. Exaggerated to accentuate point.</div></div><hr />

Since Firelands isn't quite ready yet, we've made the decision not to hold back the other 4.1 patch content for it. Instead, we're going to release patch 4.1 with the content that's ready to go so the majority of players have more things to do, while also putting some finishing touches on Firelands so we can ship it out in 4.2 shortly thereafter. We're not arbitrarily holding back Firelands. On the contrary, we don't want to hold back other content updates for Firelands.<br />
<br />
It's so fun watching Blizzard PR frantically try to spin this thing. The reality is that they don't have the design and content creation capability to push out even the barebones, linear raids with no environment design that they're doing these days. Firelands is nowhere near complete, since Blizzard has frequently shown that they have no problem pushing live half-assed and half finished content just to meet a deadline. They're trying to hide some major problems behind the scenes since 4.1 won't feature a raid and won't even feature any new content at all, just two recycled 5-mans hastily put together (ZA has no changes at all except bigger numbers).</div></div><hr />

It's quite clear that you haven't played this game for very long, most likely haven't even played any games whatsoever.<br />
Blizzard is famed for their &quot;It'll be done when it's done&quot; philosophy and all of WoW benefits from that. There is no other company in the world that delivers content with so few bugs.<br />
<br />
Which is exactly why their &quot;PR spin&quot; can only be true; they're not releasing Firelands because it's not done yet. The rest is done so that will be released. Firelands will be done when it's done and not before that. Firelands will be as buggy as the release of Ulduar and Tournament was; for such huge content updates they had surprisingly little bugs, if any at all.<br />
<br />
So please don't come here spouting your nonsense. Your complaints are totally unfounded and factually wrong.</div></div><hr />

I've played every Blizzard game since the original Warcraft and WoW since vanilla. I'm well aware of Blizzard's old &quot;It'll be done when it's done&quot; philosophy. If you've been paying any attention for the past years you'll know that philosophy is long dead. Every WoW patch ships with insanely obvious bugs and half-finished content, SC2 shipped with completely unfinished b.net 2.0. Development at Blizzard is completely driven by deadlines now, which means that having to admit that they cannot get Firelands out in time can only mean that there are some catastrophic problems with their development team.</div></div><hr />

Haha glad I'm not the only one who noticed this.<br />
<br />
I feel bad for Blizz tbh. Firelands will be released no later than Ulduar was in WotLK, yet because it was hinted that 4.1 would be Firelands it has caused a major uprising of bitching. They should have just said FU to the players and released ZA/ZG with Firelands in May. It would have caused less complaining, even though the players were getting less content. The community is so funny sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2011-03-05, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am quite happy with Blood DK tanking to be honest. It is a very active form of survivability, with so many and such a variety of tanking cooldowns available you are constantly watching your health and that of the raid to find a good spot to blow cooldowns and ease the pressure on the healer.<br />
<br />
I think people are misthinking a tanks role now, it is no longer solely about survivability, it is a lot more about taking pressure off of your healers at appropriate times (in 10 man raids particularly). DK is also far and away the strongest tank in heroics right now with many bosses being possible to solo by a well geared DK tank. Death grip pulls are fantastically CC friendly and the sheer number and variety of defensive cooldowns has a lot of subtlety and possibilities for use which just works really well.<br />
<br />
Yes, the talent tree is a bit dull and poorly laid out but that is a pretty small complaint next to how well the class plays. The main play problem is as has been pointed out a thousand times, the builtin rune meter is a steaming pile of junk and it is almost impossible to play efficiently using it. Get an addon like Docs Debug Runes however and you are good to go. I would hate to imagine going back to playing DK without that addon.</div></div><hr />

Atleast this Kolor mage you are talking about is still in Paragon, and Kolori has been in Immersion for quite some time now. If you check Paragon's website you see Kolor listed as a mage even though the profile shows a paladin so without knowing the details too well I would guess he changed his main.</div></div><hr />

Which is only fair, as Rift has stolen literally everything from WoW. I'm well aware there's nothing new under the sun, but when floating names, battleground scoreboards, action bar layout, default keybinds and even chat channel colours are identical... yeah, you've got no right to complain when someone says your game is just a reskin.<br />
<br />
Not that I dislike Rift - come talk to Vanderlubbe if you're on EU-Icewatch - but it's a bit rich to slam Blizzard for plagiarism while claiming Trion are original.</div></div><hr />

As of now, people will say that about every little thing WoW does. But if you bring up stuff Rift copied from WoW, you're just a sad fanboy.<br />
Like how people find the rifts so awesome and innovative, when a friend who's been playing it since beta explained it to me I was like... so it's basicly an expanded pre-wrath/pre-cata invasion kind of thing? Because people couldn't get enough of that right...<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Rift hater, I actually bought the game yesterday because I was curious about it (have yet to play it tough), but the way people currently act like everything Rift does is pure innovative gold and everything WoW does is absolute crap is just ludicrous.</div></div><hr />

I know people are going to say Firelands is being delayed, but it isn't. It's going to come out when it was going to come out anyway. They're just releasing the content that's already done so that they can get something out.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd say this is hopeful thinking, I take this change of schedule to mean that Blizz do not have Firelands ready and so are pushing out other content ahead to tide people over. They don't want to repeat the length of 3.3 more than they don't want to repeat the timing of 3.2.</div></div><hr />

Homogenization is a necessary evil. Or we would be stuck bringing people like that crappy undergeared/underperforming shaman, simply because he has bloodlust.<br />

<br />
Its not really a necessary evil considering we have fine wihtout such degree of homogenization before cata. No one complained before except shaman(i mean really they were only brought because of heroism, thats it). Homogenization was done because people who work long hours and only play a three or four hours maximum, to have a chance at getting into a raid. ONLY for them this change was made. I agree to homogenization to some degree if lore supports it and as long as distinctive abilities are retained. But now, battle rez which was unique druid ability became a generalized ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you don't see a problem with that? Bring the player not the class only works if all classes and specs do equally good, right now certain classes and specs get benched on various encounters because they simply suck, the entire cataclysm expansion is so caster and ranged favored it is not even funny.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lol at the youtube comments ragging on the guy's UI. Joke community. <br />
<br />
Well it is a stupid UI and completely useless and over blown at that, it is just to show off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
# New level-85 Stranglethorn quest line (phased) leading players into the troll dungeons<br />
# New tier of Heroic dungeon gear (epic item level 353) to give players a slightly bigger boost going into raids for the first time<br />
<br />
Wait.......................so new gear in &quot;new&quot; dungeons is now an extra feature? Holy balls! Who wants to bet that the items look like in the ZG days and wont be updated with better textures or models?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I find it incredibly funny that people complain about rehashed and recycled content in an expansion about rehashing and recycling content. <br />
<br />
I would like the quote on the cataclysm box or from blue posters that Cataclysm is about rehashing and recycling with the least amount of effort possible. I don't give a rats ass about 1-60 since I hate leveling and judging by the quest where I had to kill 20 infested bears for 6 infested bear guts neither does Blizzard.<br />
<br />
What people don't get is that every time they rehash dungeons and raids a potential new and GOOD dungeon or raid is &quot;lost&quot; in time and space. Imagine if instead of doing Kara they would have redone Naxx like they did in Wotlk. <br />
<br />
Why can't there be new troll dungeons? Why can't they make ZG a lvl 55 normal dungeon? As far as I am concered the more dungeons the better while I level up.</div></div><hr />

In a 10 man run, you are not guaranteed to get every class, therefore your not guaranteed every buff or ability. While you could probably get by without Mark of the Wild/Blessing of Kings, I would imagine you would find it hard if you were missing more key abilities like battle res and bloodlust.<br />

Hey look, we're forced to PvP to get gear for PvE! Sure, there's always the random chance a lockbox will have that epic Ranged weapon, but that's just as bad as trying to get a boss to drop it.</div></div><hr />

Death grip pulls are fantastically CC friendly and the sheer number and variety of defensive cooldowns has a lot of subtlety and possibilities for use which just works really well.<br />
<br />
What heroic bosses other than the ones meant to be solo tanked are solo tankable by a DK? MAYBE Ascendant Council(AMS 1 torrent, mirror+bone shield the next?) but that seems like an inconvenience anyways since glaciate+rising flames would be the most hilarious rapefest ever if you didn't just stack the fuck out of ranged dps(oh wait...).<br />
<br />
Also I highly doubt most of the top tier guilds went with Prot Paladins and Feral Druids because it was convenient, chances are they had their reasoning. Not to say DK tanks are incapable, Blood Legion seemed to do just fine, but numbers don't typically lie in these cases(plus, in the context of the way the game works, healing damage after you take it is straight inferior to mitigating the damage you take as a tank, DK's are the only tanks in the game that require an initial damage spike to get their true mitigation to show, and that leaves them dead sometimes where other tanks would be chugging along).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is hard enough to get a healer to Brez as that silence-of-stupidity happens while they kinda either zone out or hope someone else does it. Then, of course, 3 people always Brez at once.<br />
<br />
It is also nearly IMPOSSIBLE to get both ranged and melee DPS to STOP DPSing so they can do ANYTHING. Move out of fire, move into LoS, stack, disperse, whatever mechanic there is...letalone get them to stop to do something as 'pointless' and 'non-DPS-helping' as Brez someone. <br />
<br />
The DKs will say Locks should Brez first because melee is soooooooooooooooooo (eyeroll) underpowered, the Locks will whine that their DoTs need constant upkeep and their DPS is is delicate. They'll both say Rezzing is a healer's job, and the healer will be happy for half a second that Brezzing is off his piled-high plate and then sink into depression as he hears the DPS bickering and knows he'll never have a day off.<br />
<br />
Yeah, not everyone is the same. But in every raid -I've- been into, DKs are ALWAYS idiots and fill 1-3 (10s) or 1-10 (25s) spots.<br />
<br />
I don't know. I just think that spinning a wheel and having it land on the most idiot-filled class, and then the most bimbo/elitist-filled class is terribad, and they should have just streamlined all healers to have Brezzes, because obviously they don't mind handing out the skill like candy. Plus, isn't there a cap on Brezzes now, anyway? So stick it on healers so you can make them count instead of DPS who will likely misfire/overuse/misuse/forget/refuse to use them.<br />

Purely examples. Exaggerated to accentuate point.<br />
<br />
Lust =/= Brez. If Brez was put on all the healers instead of the DPS, you could the best DPS you could find instead of cherry-picking DPS because you have no Druids, effectively making it like picking extra healers. And, I swear to god the day 20k DPS gets refused with a reply of 'o, sry, w8tn on a DK, ned it 4 rez' I'm going to kill myself. I hate DKs that bad. :P Homogenization does not always have to be random and retarded, and make people angry.</div></div><hr />

It's obvious that Blizzard has done some massive harm to these people for them to act so aggressive. I'm not just saying they should quit if they're unhappy with the way Blizzard does things, but it seems like they should also quit just to become calmer, they get so angry...</div></div><hr />

Like how people find the rifts so awesome and innovative, when a friend who's been playing it since beta explained it to me I was like... so it's basicly an expanded pre-wrath/pre-cata invasion kind of thing? Because people couldn't get enough of that right...<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Rift hater, I actually bought the game yesterday because I was curious about it (have yet to play it tough), but the way people currently act like everything Rift does is pure innovative gold and everything WoW does is absolute crap is just ludicrous.<br />
<br />
I am betting it will be less than 2 months until Rifts are drastically nerfed. Already you see posts everywhere about the rifts preventing players from moving between quest hubs and how much the interfere with ´normal´gameplay. Rift is mostly a wow clone, but I think the devs there underestimated how much the wow mentality would prevail. People barely tolerated the zombie event in wow and how much it interfered with what they considered normal gameplay. Rift has basically the same players, but expects entire zones to be unavailable for questing for days because of huge rifts.<br />
<br />
I am not a Rift hater either, but you can´t market your game directly at wow players, then implement a feature that those players have already said they overwhelmingly disliked. Like I said, I think the Rift devs will catch on real soon and you will see ingame rifts very limited in how disruptive they can be to normal gameplay.</div></div><hr />

And who really cares, you can get epics already from questing (reputation), questing (tol Barad) and doing heroics.

Blizzard is famed for their &quot;It'll be done when it's done&quot; philosophy and all of WoW benefits from that. There is no other company in the world that delivers content with so few bugs.<br />
<br />
Which is exactly why their &quot;PR spin&quot; can only be true; they're not releasing Firelands because it's not done yet. The rest is done so that will be released. Firelands will be done when it's done and not before that. Firelands will be as buggy as the release of Ulduar and Tournament was; for such huge content updates they had surprisingly little bugs, if any at all.<br />
<br />
So please don't come here spouting your nonsense. Your complaints are totally unfounded and factually wrong.<br />
<br />
Among the worst posts I've ever read. The notion (and that's all it is... a notion) that Blizzard cares about the state of their content is laughable. The game launched over 6 years ago, with 4 years of development, and the servers crashed for 48-72 hours. Over the next 4 years, it was NOT uncommon for Tuesday patches or hot fixes or realm restarts to crash the servers for upwards of 2 days. I think the first patch in LK nuked peoples connections for months. In fact, right before LK, they forced people to dl a patch designed to be content for LK, which caused severe issues for days on end.<br />
<br />
These are just the examples I can think off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Yes, this is spin. They said what they meant, then they saw their metrics for peak play-time hrs dwindle (cough cough Rift) and had to do dmg control.<br />

Agreed. Let the non-raiders have their purples. Any player in a decent raiding guild has almost all 359 and above gear by now. All this will do for us is give us much cheaper enchants and possibly get that 1 piece of gear that hasn't dropped in 2 months. (Bracers and ranged weapons anyone?)</div></div><hr />

Its not even that. Put it this way. If you are good enough to complete these new heroics (which will be harder than current heroics) then more than likely you already have 2 or 3 peices from the valor vendor, 2 or 3 from rep rewards, and probably another from TB dailies. The truly bad players are still not completing heroics easily and probably are not getting the VPs most days. They will probably not have the ilevel to even queue for the new heroics, and if they do, they will probably fail out of pugs anyway. There are still real ´levels´of players now, but this patch will allow the good casual players who don´t raid to advance their character and enchants....</div></div><hr />

The number of times i did 10 man runs in wrath and had no druids. Had a few Dks and locks though.<br />
<br />
In a 10 man run, you are not guaranteed to get every class, therefore your not guaranteed every buff or ability. While you could probably get by without Mark of the Wild/Blessing of Kings, I would imagine you would find it hard if you were missing more key abilities like battle res and bloodlust.<br />

obviously your raid leader is not good at setting up a raid, you can fill every roll in a raid with every class in a 10 man, and manage to get the debuff up on the boss<br />

The fact that the only druid in our group is a tank even further stretches why it's better to have a DK doing the rezzing. You don't want your druid tank shifting out of bear form only to have them get one-shot because their damage mitigation was dropped for a second. It will also take less time for a DK to rez someone than it would for the druid because it's instant cast.<br />
<br />
Seriously, druids complaining about DKs being able to brez people is no different than complaining about their own dps/tank specs being able to do the same... you want it to be a healer thing so bad?

<br />
#1: ok, thats new, phasing and few new quests, i'll give this to them<br />
#2: new tear of heroic gear..? wait, isn't that the loot from ZG and ZA, so it shouldn't even be listed as a different point because it counts as a must-have for even implementing &quot;new&quot; dungeons<br />
#3: my 5k Gold says, this is just another wording for &quot;new guild achievments to do inside of ZA and ZG&quot;<br />
<br />
So again, the only &quot;new&quot; content is the questing area and phasing, the rest is up until now just rehashed and recycled content, not even worth bringing out a patch... but.. thats just my opinion, huh?<br />

No, his was right on. Yours. however, is quite inaccurate.<br />
<br />
<br />
The notion (and that's all it is... a notion) that Blizzard cares about the state of their content is laughable.<br />
<br />
If they didn't care about the state of their content, they'd stop adding things to the game and cease to make changes to classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
The game launched over 6 years ago, with 4 years of development, and the servers crashed for 48-72 hours. <br />
<br />
Not much software dev experience, do you? Beta test software as much as you want, but there will always be things that come up once it goes live.<br />
<br />
<br />
Over the next 4 years, it was NOT uncommon for Tuesday patches or hot fixes or realm restarts to crash the servers for upwards of 2 days.<br />
<br />
It actually is uncommon....extremely uncommon. Borderline rare. There will always be a small segment that have issues where the larger population doesn't, but that takes us back to the previous point.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the first patch in LK nuked peoples connections for months. In fact, right before LK, they forced people to dl a patch designed to be content for LK, which caused severe issues for days on end.<br />
<br />
Again with this absurd line of thinking. There was no patch that 'nuked peoples connections for months', nor was there any patch that causes issues for days on end. If you want to take a small segment of users that have had issues such as this and bash Blizz because of it, that's fine. Know that you come across as a complete fool that has no clue what he's talking about. Please see my previous two statements on software dev. NO software is bug proof and NO software will work fine for everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, this is spin. They said what they meant, then they saw their metrics for peak play-time hrs dwindle (cough cough Rift) and had to do dmg control.<br />

<br />
Where do you come up with this stuff? If you think Rift is making ANY kind of dent in WoW's subscription base or general play-time, you're delusional.<br />
<br />
There is no A nor B team. One team got WoW up and running, which was their job. The second group is there to maintain and improve. This is a pretty common theme amongst all software dev studios. <br />
<br />
Most would agree that WoW is better now than it's ever been. Especially those that actually did play during Vanilla and BC. Whereas people like you simply read about it and try to act like you've been playing for years.</div></div><hr />

GC didn´t go anywhere. He just stopped posting on the forums, because after 2 years, he finally realized what everyone else knows... it is a waste of time to try to communicate with players on public forums. His time is better spent developing the game and keeping in more intimate contact with players who can provide reasonable feedback. Everyone enjoyed GC because he was so accessible... but I am sure that he (and maybe his bosses) realized that accessiblility was wasting too much of his time and not providing a real advantage to the game.</div></div><hr />

In fact wow, was revolutionary. They commercialised mmos and brought them to the masses, that was something revolutionary. <br />

There is also a big difference, which seems to slip by people. Rift took almost all of wows ideas and added a few of theire own, wow takes one feautre from rift, and its a good feature. So no Rift cloned wow, wow didnt clone rift, they took one feautre from it.<br />

And this is why anyone who understands WoW hates Ghostcrawler.<br />
<br />
Oh will you stop trying to pretend you have the masses behind you. This is your, YOUR, opinion which you have to stand behind on your own two little legs. Here is my opinion, having to answear 192823482789 posts with people crying and ragining over pointless and nonsensical things might make you a bit crancky. But sure lets pretend wow forum is not filled weird raging threads about absolutly everything.</div></div><hr />

Is it so hard to actually figure back then &quot;oh making &quot;new code&quot; is too much work nvm for now&quot;, so they could have let SS be in a state where it's somewhat useful (because right now it's not, as you can only use 1 res per fight). Besides, new code? What? Is it so hard to just delete the soulstone code and copypaste the rebirth one? This actually worries me. Are they coming up with some shitty mechanic that they think is original, like &quot;you must store a soul before you can res&quot;. I can already imagine the following raid situation. &quot;LOCK, RES HIM&quot;. &quot;FFS I FORGET TO STOR A SOOL BEFOR FIGT SOZ GUISE&quot;. Considering the long and painful quality of life past of warlocks, I wouldn't be surprised at all.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I'm just being grim and pessimistic.</div></div><hr />

The dps start going more and more damage, and Vengeance causes the tank to scale right along side them. Just because you hate Ghostcrawler doesn't mean he is wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have no idea how Vengeance works do you? Let's put it in simple terms..<br />
<br />
Tank gets hit &gt; Tank gains Atk Pwr based on Maximum HP &gt; Tank does more threat due to increase in AP.<br />
<br />
Now, tank gets better gear &gt; Tank gets hit for less &gt; Tank gains less Vengeance &gt; Tank does less threat.<br />
<br />
After &quot;now&quot; doesn't really apply in current tier raids, but I am already seeing problems with vengeance not stacking in heroics unless I chain pull the place.<br />
<br />
So, now i've made it clear, please enlighten me how you thought vengeance scaled with the damage dealer's gear?</div></div><hr />

Offhands aren't much better with Scaleslicer being trash, but at least Cho'gall coughed up an offhand for one of them finally. It's really sad our best melees are still rocking blue weapons cause the drops are so stupid.</div></div><hr />

I forgot most people can't think more than 5 seconds into something.<br />
<br />
Vengeance makes the tank do more damage. DPS do more damage as they get more gear. Vengeance makes a tank's threat scale with the dps' threat.<br />
<br />
Sorry that was so hard for you.</div></div><hr />

You didn't say scale with the dps' threat, you said scale with the dps' gear. Anyways, congrats to immersion and method too since they got it only a day later according to guildox.</div></div><hr />

Their threat scales with their gear. If Vengeance is scaling with the dps' threat, than it's indirectly scaling with the dps' gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you seem to have been under a bit of a rock for all of the cata coverage, launch and managed to not hear it from someone since:<br />
<br />
At 4.1 (now 4.2) valor points you currently have are added to justice points and the VP count wiped. Justice points will then buy the &quot;old&quot; tier (i.e the one we have now) and valor points will be for T12</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was speaking about Ghostcrawler and the fact that people think they can say absolutly what they want to him but if he is remotly sarcastic or sounds a bit pissed in his respons people are absolutly shocked!<br />
<br />
Now he does have to answear since its, or was, his job, but no i dont have to but i decided to try and explain this to you.</div></div><hr />

Guilds have already done it with nobody dying, but not on their first attempt. World first might be coming at any moment.</div></div><hr />

Guild Challenges (new guild quests)<br />
We're preparing all of the information on this new feature for you. <br />
<br />
Oh blizzard you are so silly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crispin</div><div class="date">2011-03-06, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Wait ... what? World first? Yeah. Blizzard had a point when they said that a lot of players aren't finished with the content yet&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
So you're saying that raiding is all there is to WoW, you'd think that it was obvious that the majority of WoW players can't commit to raiding guilds who spend their time on every single achievment in a raid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cows For Life</div><div class="date">2011-03-07, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's quite clear that you haven't played this game for very long, most likely haven't even played any games whatsoever.<br />
Blizzard is famed for their &quot;It'll be done when it's done&quot; philosophy and all of WoW benefits from that. There is no other company in the world that delivers content with so few bugs.<br />
<br />
Which is exactly why their &quot;PR spin&quot; can only be true; they're not releasing Firelands because it's not done yet. The rest is done so that will be released. Firelands will be done when it's done and not before that. Firelands will be as buggy as the release of Ulduar and Tournament was; for such huge content updates they had surprisingly little bugs, if any at all.<br />
<br />
So please don't come here spouting your nonsense. Your complaints are totally unfounded and factually wrong.<br />
<br />
Did you try any part of the pre-Cataclysm world event at all? That thing was filled with tons of bugs at each and every step of the way but it had to be put out anyway because the higher ups decided on a pre-Christmas release and had already purchased TV ad time.<br />
<br />
As for the Tournament, don't the champions in TOC5 disappear after engagement STILL? How about that cogwheel crash bug that crippled that instance (and HHM) for two weeks? I still remember the Blizzard poster going on to the forums and saying that they weren't seeing any problems! How about their &quot;fix&quot; for people attacking Tyrannus in Pit of Saron while he was talking, which actually broke it. That bug resisted several patches and it's probably still broken. Ha ha ha<br />
<br />
Re: epic gear. Will the people with massive egos give it a rest. It's there so that people coming to the party late don't have to run obsolete raids just to catch up on gear. It has nothing to do with your petty precious epeen.</div></div><hr />
