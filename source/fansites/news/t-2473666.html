To be fair, this came to light only because they said that they will allow us to hide the chest, so... everyone went like... WHAT ABOUT GUANTLES AND BRACERS?!<br />
<br />
And to be fair, i was one of those (I spend most of my game time getting mounts and transmog sets, so imagine)<br />

Is there anything you won't try to spin into a negative? Your raging hate-on for this game is incredibly obvious, you should probably step away for awhile and cool down, the fact that Blizzard made a completely positive change to the game and you still view it negatively because they have other issues to fix is just plain sad.</div></div><hr />

Unless your weapon is a wand, sadly. Since it counts as a ranged weapon, you can't use your artifact appearances over one. It seems like something really easy to fix, too, just make wands count as melee weapons since unlike bows, guns and crossbows for Hunters, none of the caster abilities actually require a wand equipped.</div></div><hr />

That's because originally most of monk attacks used to sheath the weapons and hit with bare hands. It was in Legion with Artifacts that they changed them to use weapons.</div></div><hr />

Point is, as soon as dragons are involved, realism goes completely out the window anyway. And it's not people with silly mogs are the majority now when you can easily dress as a farmer, dandy or lumberjack. People will try things out initially, those who like underdressed looks (and are already playing humans/elves in slutmogs anyway) will enjoy it and the rest of us will move on, or rejoice at the opportunity to hide some select pieces (such as a Monk going bare fisted or a Garrosh lookalike perpetually eschewing shirts).</div></div><hr />

Here's a little gem for you: YOU thinking there's crap wrong with the game =/= there's anything on their end suggesting that people at large feel that way. They have access to actual data and figures on player engagement, + endless amounts of feedback given in-game and researched (there's an entire team focusing on that part). <br />

To bad no pants, Still can't use Vestments of the Shifting Sands as a transmog it seems :(<br />
<br />
You can use it just fine.<br />
<br />
Just gotta settle for pants that show the least amount of cloth possible in the &quot;naked&quot; areas. I tend to use this:<br />

I do think that more people will try slutmogs, but mostly for the lols, those that already run those type of mogs are they ones that will stay like that, the others? naaa they will just use this added options to make other transmogs.</div></div><hr />

It’s especially bad when they clip into the ground as a result.<br />

I just think that the weapon mogs should be altered to allow people to transmog weapons they can use. IE: Blood Dks dual wield, Frost DKs get a 2 gander, make a staff into a 1h and off hand, etc. Just as long as there is logic behind it.</div></div><hr />

The only ones displaying immense levels of stupid behaviour are the idiots so single-minded they're busy believing that shit is mutually exclusive when it simply ain't.

<br />
Lol .. the ”No Pants Movement” … I’ll sign that.<br />
<br />
But in all seriousness it is ridiculous. The moment they came up with, not only the transmorg option but the option to hide shoulders and helmet, should also have been the moment they had given us the freedom to hide every bit of armor, from boots, pants and gloves as well.<br />
<br />
Telling us “You can hide your hat but not your belt” is just telling us “because uhm reasons” (Aka no reasons). It’s the half- freedom with no valid reasons. I would understand if transmorg was not an option at all because they wanted to keep the games visuals in a certain way, fair enough.<br />
<br />
I can also understand the reasons why you can only transmog into items your character can equip and use (Clothe for clothe users and no Priests can’t wield two-handed axes etc.). <br />
<br />
But the “You can hide your hat but not your gloves” makes no sense (to me).</div></div><hr />

Customization is simply fun for a lot of people, and being able to take the mental image of what they want their character to be, and actually achieve that look in-game, is a great thing.<br />
<br />
It's perfectly fine to not care about it, but it's a big deal for many players, and when &quot;lack of customization, especially when compared to other MMOs&quot; is one of the more common complaints the game has, any step they take to improve it is a good one.<br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe someday you'll look at your character and decide they look cooler shirtless.</div></div><hr />

There are a few robes in WoW that split down the thigh and it would be so nice to not have to show bits of oddly colored fabric at the tops/bottoms of the slits. I get them not adding a &quot;hide pants&quot; option for all the time, but I think these robes should be changed to where they automatically hide pants when using them.<br />

I don't. Give me pantslessness or give me death! :p</div></div><hr />
