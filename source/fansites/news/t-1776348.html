Knowing Blizzard they've probably put some NPC who says Mystic Runesabers are only found in Farahlon.<br />

<br />
Yes because a mount being added directly correlates to the development of content. You do realize that the team working on mounts like this, isn't the same team working on game content development?<br />
<br />
That being said, I don't agree with Blizzard releasing the mounts in the store, instead of being earnable in-game, even though it might be the most solid decision for them from a financial point of view.</div></div><hr />

People seem to get more mad with every new product added, so there must be a reason to it.<br />
As said; not picking a side here, it's a company who wants to make money, but a big part of the gaming community has other priorities.</div></div><hr />

How it is possible to has more profit with less subscribers ? This is the way.... this is the future. If you have less subscribers, put some mounts to the ingame shop. And there will be balance and profit won´t change during the quarter, because of the revenues from the shop mounts/pets/services(WoW Token). It´s business mon!<br />
<br />
I hope that Blizzard have some &quot;In-game shop department&quot; and these mounts won´t slow down producing of the patch content. But nevermind... these mounts are at least rehashed models.</div></div><hr />

Oh well at least they added saddles to like 6 or 7 mobs for this expansion. That really made the increased box cost value for valued customers.</div></div><hr />

I play WoW because I enjoy it. I do not have a lot of money and at times struggle to keep up with the monthly subscription. However, the introduction of the 'Token' and the items for sale in the 'Shop' are purchased by choice by those that play the game and enjoy it's content. Blizzard is a company which produces a product for people to purchase. By default they are going to be making money from those purchases. If any company can see a way to increase their profit margin they will do. Although, in my opinion, Blizzard are one of the rare companies that do actually listen to what the community says and tries to please them. Unfortunately they will never please everyone - especially most of you who have written here. If you want to part with your cash then purchase the game. Once inside the game if you want to purchase anything from the 'shop' with your cash then do so.

Just look at it. It's all acraney and shit. Khadgar infused and stuff. But nope, they want $$$ and give us some pathetic talbuk reskin obtainable ingame instead.<br />
<br />
And being a grounded mount only...<br />
<br />
Fuck this no flying saltyness already. The game is a fucking chore without flying. This has been said a million times before and apparently it needs to be said 10 million times more on their fucking official forums. Enable the god damn flying. Stop this sorry ass experiment.<br />
<br />
I don't usually throw so many F bombs in a single short post... but this is infuriating. Incoming more paid-only crap while the game is still a bland grindy fuckfest that offers nothing other than raiding ad nauseaum (pointless anyway as you can see everything on braindead LFR mode and obtain all the special snowflake gear later on in next tier or expac)</div></div><hr />

On top of that, blizzard outright refuses to balance classes/races and always says, &quot;we'll do it in 7.0&quot;, guess what we're going to get in 7.0? it's going to cost $60 now, content and class revamps will be postponed to 8.0, 7.1 will solely be the addition of gnome hunters and pvp garrison missions, where traits and abilities have no effect and it's completely random, whose followers win, and the collector's edition will cost you your firstborn child and will give you a white mountain horse, levelling 10-110 will just place you in a huge pit that's an apexis daily, and you'll pay a $15 ticket fee to enter the current raid, where it will just be alliance/horde encampments at the front, and a command table, you send your followers on a raid mission, but now you can watch them wipe for 8 hours on one wing of the raid, pvp will be a race to link more achievements with the word anal before it, and conquest gear will be recolored versions of your character's undergarments.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately fanboyism is huge here in MMO-Champ. If only people understood how ridiculous it is to have better designed mounts in the store rather than on the actual game, then maybe they would see how Blizz cares about their players - and consequently, I hope, stop defending them at all costs.</div></div><hr />

People complain because they care. I won't buy it, but it will certainly sell like hotcakes. That doesn't mean I have to agree with the philosophy of micro transactions in a subscription based game, where the mounts you can earn in game are objectively worse than the ones available for real money. This coming at a time where they are losing 25% of their subs due to a lack of content. Even if you for some ridiculous reason like cash shop mounts, you have to admit this is poorly timed.</div></div><hr />

They can't fix this mess of boredom fast, it would require some time and major changes, but if they are willing to do that, I doubt it. Also their mentality of this over that, it can't be both is also something they need to think over. <br />
<br />
I personally liked daily quests a lot more as the timeless isle for example in fact I was bored with the isle after one visit, why can't we get both, dailys and zones like the timeless isle? What's the problem with that. Anyway, I'm not playing for 3 months now, and I don't miss it a single bit at the moment, I will probably return to at some point, but right now I'm done with raiding and nothing else to do that is not boredom. <br />

In-game shop would be fine and dandy if everything else was fine.</div></div><hr />

&quot;I'm fine with your content blizzard, I'd be fine with anything, even mounts, or change my character from being blue skinned, to lighter blue skinned! If you put effort into it, make it an extra charge! How Else would Celestalon afford to pay to fuel the two motorcycles that he and holinka ride in circles around the office all day!&quot;<br />

&quot;I really want this mount you spent over 5 minutes making, and you will never make another remotely close to it available ingame, so I guess I'll have to buy it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
The decrease in subs in Cata's entirety was equal to this quarter, that's only 1/8 of the decline we've had recently, and the reason people camped poundfist was because he was the only gronnling not gated by raiding, now tell me why does it happen to be that nearly every animal in draenor that had the skeleton of an existing mount, (Boars/Riverbeasts-&gt; Direhorn, Talbuk-&gt; Horse, Wolf-&gt; Old Wolf, Elekk-&gt; Old Elekk, Gronnling-&gt; Yeti) not just every animal, but every skin color of that animal will have a mount form of it by 6.2? The only exceptions are ravens that use the skyscreamer model, which will have one used reskin in 6.2, ravagers that use the Quiraj model, and rylaks that use a new skeleton, but guess what? they're all CE/Blizzstore mounts, blizz can't use those animals again for some arbitrary reason.<br />
<br />
Store mounts aren't what is making subs decline, it's the fact that blizzard thinks they can get away with reskinning every piece of lazy content they make, and give it a new name and UI, even though they are aware that the player base hates this content, 50% of what blizzard promised for wod was cut, and they're spitting in the wounds and praying that the patient (player base) doesn't notice they've been treated by a quack.</div></div><hr />

I am starting to think the real reasons for all these services and store items is to rake in extra cash where the subs have fallen to keep investors happy. Lets face it if blizzard were making a loss in profits and subscriptions investors will be pulling out and the game wont be advancing as well. I guess in a warped way if this is right store mounts and services are doing us a favour :S game could be a worse place without them.</div></div><hr />

Na for me personally I think keeping the investors happy by getting money even with sub loss's is better than just loosing money. If we Blizzard was loosing investment that just means slower content or less quality. It's not going to be a good thing. A few store mounts and pets here and there though I am fine with if that's necessary to keep them happy. <br />
<br />
What I do dislike is charging for lvl90 boosts, name changes, faction change, sex change, race change. Those things if free could keep people playing the game for longer imo. I know many people who get bored of the game and want to try an alt, trouble is they don't want to level one or pay £40 on a game they are bored of just to try something. This just results in a sub drop from the game and a loss for blizzard. <br />

The crying in this post amazes me. ... <br />
Yes, they charge a monthly sub, and if you did your garrison quests you could pay for in game without any effort. ..<br />
Yes, they sell their best looking mounts (recently) in the in game store, that you are not required to buy. ..<br />
<br />
How the hell does that effect most of you? F2p with micro-transactions is the main model for most currently successful franchises/games. <br />
At least Blizz's aren't game breaking. And the provide multiple tiers per expansion. Would you rather it go f2p and charge for the new dlc raid/zone/models/gear? <br />
<br />
They use the custom mounts/pets to help offset the sub loses, so that they don't have to reduce staff orslow development, even more than we're used to.</div></div><hr />

f2p and we buy it on the effort they put into it and if its bad we dont buy it.<br />

On top of that, blizzard outright refuses to balance classes/races and always says, &quot;we'll do it in 7.0&quot;, guess what we're going to get in 7.0? it's going to cost $60 now, content and class revamps will be postponed to 8.0, 7.1 will solely be the addition of gnome hunters and pvp garrison missions, where traits and abilities have no effect and it's completely random, whose followers win, and the collector's edition will cost you your firstborn child and will give you a white mountain horse, levelling 10-110 will just place you in a huge pit that's an apexis daily, and you'll pay a $15 ticket fee to enter the current raid, where it will just be alliance/horde encampments at the front, and a command table, you send your followers on a raid mission, but now you can watch them wipe for 8 hours on one wing of the raid, pvp will be a race to link more achievements with the word anal before it, and conquest gear will be recolored versions of your character's undergarments.<br />

I've just decided it's their game and they're going to do whatever they want with it. I've temporarily chosen not to be a part of it, but we'll see if that changes in the future.<br />
<br />
Given everyone's expectation for the next expansion being something with Azshara and the history of the last two expansions being completely out of the blue I'm going to assume it's going to be something unexpected and more than likely disappointing. Probably some void-themed expansion with more orcs set in Draenor with 3 zones and a special selfie screenshot feature to put picture frames in your garrisons. <br />
<br />
And maybe more one-time loot chests and rares with mostly useless gear and toys.</div></div><hr />

I lol'd.<br />
<br />
Also, it does seem like they actively choose not to give the player base the things they ask for, (outside of insane things like no flying - who really wanted that again?) like the burning legion or emerald dream expansion. Instead we get MoP and WoD.<br />
<br />
Class changes that seem obvious, but they choose some &quot;sneaky&quot; alternative they apparently think is clever and innovative, and then it completely fails to deliver or fix the problem.<br />

Sometimes the simple choice is the best one, but Blizzard hasn't seemed to have figured that out yet. More store mounts will fix it though.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that there is an extreme lack of open world end game content in WoD, and a lot of players have been expressing this sentiment on the forums. I'm not an avid pet or mount collector, but if a mount that I like is added to the game (through faction reputations, specifically) I will try to obtain it. In the past these mounts have been unique and tied to specific factions -- think Nether Ray from BC, Cloud Serpents from MoP, and are obtained through story development and additional lore through daily quests or whatever. In WoD, all of the faction mounts are reskins--bland, boring, and uninteresting, and they're purchasable by mindlessly grinding mobs to exalted. Almost all of the mounts that were recently added to the store (Fey Dragon, Dread Raven) are super easily tied into current WoD factions (Council of the Exarchs, and Arrakoa, respectively) but instead of them being obtainable through in-game content, they're only purchasable through the store. Clearly these store mounts were most likely pulled from in-game (purchasable at Exalted with the respective faction) and put up on the store. It's ridiculous. That's why people should be and are angry.</div></div><hr />

Won't be buying and will tell everyone I know to not gift me this mount. Won't want to support them charging the same price for shitty ground only mounts as the flying ones, and don't want to support this moronic idea that the truly unique mounts can't be obtainable in game anymore. Just look at rylaks, ravagers, fairie dragons...all seen in Draenor, flying around, yet not a single one of the fucking factions offer anything other than old mount models with a coat of new paint...wolves running like Azeroth worgs, hippos and boars running as if they're on speed because developers didn't bother to adapt the direhorn animations, talbuks with stiff tails, elekks and clefthoofs...and now the next meta mount is a reskin of the CE mount, which can't even fly in Draenor...fantastic!<br />

This + wow tokens, probably will make up for any revenue from the 3 mill loss subs + any more that happen before end of june.<br />

Yes because a mount being added directly correlates to the development of content. You do realize that the team working on mounts like this, isn't the same team working on game content development?<br />
<br />
True, the art team doesn't come up with the ideas, but if they're working on &quot;beautifully reskinned mounts&quot; in an afternoon, they won't have time to work on the V.I.N.E. D.E.V.I.C.E. filters or new costumes for Pepe.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they charge a monthly sub, and if you did your garrison quests you could pay for in game without any effort. ..<br />
Yes, they sell their best looking mounts (recently) in the in game store, that you are not required to buy. ..<br />
<br />
How the hell does that effect most of you? F2p with micro-transactions is the main model for most currently successful franchises/games. <br />
At least Blizz's aren't game breaking. And the provide multiple tiers per expansion. Would you rather it go f2p and charge for the new dlc raid/zone/models/gear? <br />
<br />
They use the custom mounts/pets to help offset the sub loses, so that they don't have to reduce staff orslow development, even more than we're used to.<br />
<br />
You can't be serious and even more so if you typed that with a straight face. This is the type of player Blizzard thrives off, folks.....<br />

You know that Blizzard could have observed the immense sub drop BEFORE the sub results, right? Or do you think that on May 6th, Blizzard met in a room and a big computer printed out results and they were like OMG WE LOST 3 MIO PEOPLE!!?! Well good thing we have that mount from February! <br />
<br />
Of course they started making the mount as soon as they saw a sub was lost every 4 seconds, it's the only way they know how to buffer the cash loss. They're masters of band aiding. For reference, see Ashran.</div></div><hr />

Not only did I deside to never play HOS, but also never to return back to WOW or ANY other Blizzard game. Just disgusting.</div></div><hr />

I feel insulted now by Blizzard. They could add this mount as an special event with some quests that, I don't know, required us to play the game to earn it. Maybe complete some dungeons sumoning special mobs, kill some outdoor shit and solving a ridle... There are no shortage of ideas for content.

<br />
Yes, exactly! And then people would have content to do in the world. And maybe if they added a bunch of similar stuff, people wouldn't unsub because they have nothing to do. What's the point of a new mount if a person is bored with WoW to the point of unsubscribing.</div></div><hr />

It is funny to see that the real problem in this game is the toxic and vitriolic community rather than an OPTIONAL -FUCKING OPTIONAL- shop mount. You want mounts with prestige there are tons out there, but no hey &quot;We WANT prestigious mounts not in shop BUT in LFR&quot; or something.

&quot;lots of people with 3k achievments points complain about the game having zero content, others with 1k arena rating saying that the PvP is imbalanced, and those with max PvE clear being LFR say that raiding is too easy....<br />

People that cry without tomorrow in here are the really butthurt people that the vast majority does not even play the game in the first place. They are the people that come from SWTOR in which the end -game community tends to not exist and if exists is not new user friendly, the queues for dungeons and raids are over 2 hour in the busy days and there is tons of content to do but people really do not care. They are the players from Final Fantasy that they see 7m subs in WoW and they cannot understand how a game 10 years old can have such a dedicated base when they play a series that is the definition of nostalgia milking &quot;Someday the new FF VII will come you will seeeeee&quot;.<br />
<br />
WoD has its problems -like any other expansion- which I agree into some extend is the lack of content and a fail 6.1 but instead of crying like little kids lets try to deliver a more constructive feedback and less &quot;AJSODAJSOFJAAS I NEED BALANCE ASajfblajsbflasf&quot; type of feedback.

Only Blizzard gets away with pulling these tricks, while EA would get crucified for it.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they charge a monthly sub, and if you did your garrison quests you could pay for in game without any effort. ..<br />
Yes, they sell their best looking mounts (recently) in the in game store, that you are not required to buy. ..<br />
<br />
How the hell does that effect most of you? F2p with micro-transactions is the main model for most currently successful franchises/games. <br />
At least Blizz's aren't game breaking. And the provide multiple tiers per expansion. Would you rather it go f2p and charge for the new dlc raid/zone/models/gear? <br />
<br />
They use the custom mounts/pets to help offset the sub loses, so that they don't have to reduce staff orslow development, even more than we're used to.<br />
<br />
The problem, besides the very obvious problem of having microtransactions (if a cosmetic item that costs the same as 1 and 2/3s months of the sub can even be called a &quot;micro&quot;transaction), is that this entire expansion pack as been a let down and a joke. Cut content, broken promises, a major system that I would call a facebook game if it wasn't such an insult to facebook games, and isolating the player base from each other more than ever before.<br />
<br />
At the start of the beta we were promised (and for the bullshit reasoning that Blizzard gave that they never &quot;promised&quot; anything, I believe it was Bashiok who said something near the begining of Highmaul on something else that even though they didn't promise the thing he was talking about it was implied and so they got it out. This was after the whole &quot;we never promised Karabor xD&quot; shit they pulled) Horde and Alliance capital cities which included Karabor a huge icon for many WoW players. What we got instead was Ashran, a boring and bland capital city that frankly feels the same to me as all of the other out posts I visited while leveling. <br />
<br />
Tanaan jungle was meant to be release content but got delayed until 6.1, and now 6.2. Farahlon no longer being added to the game. The huge mess of having 3 levels of progression content to raid through. <br />
<br />
The stream lining of profressions and Mine/Garden in the garrison removing any reason to go out and explore the world outside of your garrison or Ashran has made this expansion a huge failure for anything outside of raiding.<br />
<br />
And what are they doing instead of fixing any of this? Instead of making any new content or things to do in the new zones or anything to help the problems? Making store content to sell for more than we pay for the entire content of WoW a month. And don't try to say that the store team isn't the same that work on real content because I am willing to bet good money they don't hire artists, animations, etc, to only make store content.<br />
<br />
To be frank this expansion is a mess, it's a giant failure with it losing more players in Q1 than Cata (widly considered the worst expansion by most people I talked to pre-wod) did over the entire expansion. And if I wasn't raiding I wouldn't be playing.</div></div><hr />

Hate is a very strong feeling - I think you mixed it up with pity - I just pity such actions/people - just be a bit critical. There system work because of such like you. The only way they will listen is if you hit there wallet. They slap you in your face and you say thank you sir.</div></div><hr />

Ohh please...do you seriously thinks the Blizzard does not watching the subs numbers constantly? Do you think they doing a big counting on the last days of a given quarter and start to realize &quot;ooops, we lost 1/3 of our subscriptions, what now?&quot; All the token things (deciding the price per EU, USA, etc based on the expected change in subs in the next 3-4 quarters) all the new shop items or perhaps (not coming, but i expect something soon) new paid service is based on the monitoring of the subs and the income.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you compare Q1 2014 profit of the Blizzard from call and Q1 2015 profit from call you will understand. How it is possible to has more profit with less subscribers ? This is the way.... this is the future. If you have less subscribers, put some mounts to the ingame shop. And there will be balance and profit won´t change during the quarter, because of the revenues from the shop mounts/pets/services(WoW Token). It´s business mon!<br />
<br />
I hope that Blizzard have some &quot;In-game shop department&quot; and these mounts won´t slow down producing of the patch content. But nevermind... these mounts are at least rehashed models.<br />

You're way over-complicating things. I don't see why so many people get their underpants in a twist over the in-game store items. It's obviously an item that people want; and if you don't want it, don't buy it. People buy them for many different reasons, and they make good gifts for people you know that play.<br />
<br />
Blizzard knows their mount audience, and they know how many they'll buy in a year. They know how many they sell the first week, first month, and when the interest starts falling off on the newest mount. It's a simple calculation as to how many mounts they should release in a year to maximize mount revenue vs art time spent. Subscription numbers have nothing to do with it.<br />
<br />
It's a high margin item, and they know it's not for the majority of the population. Most people say, &quot;that's a waste of money for me.&quot; But enough people find enough value in the item to purchase it, or don't care about the cost. It's like the items they have on display near the cash registers at IRL stores.</div></div><hr />

Not only that but the same people that they are now on a witch hunt are not afraid to spend like 100 euros in a month for..... wait for it..... -LoL skins- this thing is just disgusting. I tell you what lets start a different kind of boycott:<br />
<br />
lets start boycott all these players that have 3k achiev points and they crying that there is no content to do.<br />
lets start boycott all these that they do all the things in the garrison and they cry about as if you cannot move outside the Garrison.<br />
lets start boycott all these that have 800 honorable kills and under 1k rating in the arena and they spend more time crying in the forums about balance than learning their class and how to interrupt. <br />
lets start boycott all these that they want to have everything raiding can provide by just doing LFR. <br />
<br />
Constant negativity and outcry on almost everything without any structure or factors to back up your outcry is just the worst thing in these forums. If this *OPTIONAL* and let me say it again for those that cannot understand it *O P T I O N A L* mounts where available only in mythic raiding the outcry would have been the same like &quot;The raiders are taking everything!!!&quot;.

if you buy this mount you are a part of the problem<br />
<br />
Pretty much. Just like the WoW Token, this is just another attempt to nickel and dime those who remain loyal. Never mind actually making new content for loyal subscribers. Let's just milk them for all they are worth!<br />
<br />
And you are correct. People that fall for this, again, just like the WoW Token, are part of the problem. The more people stuff Blizzard's pockets full of money over schemes like this, the more likely we are to see content droughts like this on the back of already disappointing expansions. You are only hurting yourself in the end.</div></div><hr />

Doubt that. 3 million people pay $15 every month, so it's about 450 mil a month. Store mount is more expensive, but there's no chance that the mount will sell for more than 450 milllion every month. That would mean that about 2 million people out of 7 million would buy the mount every month.</div></div><hr />

There is no problem to a lot of people. Stop being a grumpy asshole, calling people &quot;retards&quot; just because they enjoy the game (or part of it) more than you. <br />

A lot of them should, in my opinion, be obtainable in-game. Through achievements or as rare drops. I do not like the direction Blizzard is going with the mounts right now. I just feel the most amazing and good looking mounts should be hard to get and require the players to invest both time and preferably also skill. That makes them valuable, unique and with a story behind them that most wont forget in the first place. I still remember when I finally got raven lord, the black proto drake and other achievement mounts (never had much luck with drop based mounts, lol, am still farming Onyxia.. Its been years).<br />

Paying to get everything I want in an instant is surely convenient, but it's also boring as fuck which sucks all the fun out from it for me.</div></div><hr />

Althought I agree with the lack of content in the current state I cannot agree with the fact that you call constant content flow the programming and developing of the game etc. etc. Blizzard also develops every day , hotfixes are deployed at least once per week, that process is not current content. LoL is just a glorified MOBA map/maps that you do the same matches over and over again like BGs in WoW. You can compare the balancing effort they put in PvP I agreed but you cannot say that Riot has a constant content flow and most important you cannot compare the content flow of an MMO rpg with the content in a MOBA game. MMO cost &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; MOBA cost in terms of developing. And again hotfixes are not current content.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghosting</div><div class="date">2015-05-09, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the players defending the shop mount are missing the point of why people are raging, because &quot;if you don't like it, don't buy it&quot; doesn't apply to the current situation.<br />
<br />
No one can deny the fact that WoD has less content than any other expansion this far out from launch, and I believe the massive sub loss helps support this point. The majority of the 7 million players that were still left after SoO, clearly did not care one bit about content, since they were stuck with the same stuff for 14 months. So it's safe to say the 3 million player boost came from players expecting more content. And we know how that turned out.<br />
<br />
If the game was in a better state, I don't think anyone would care about the shop mount. But putting it up on the shop right after the sub loss announcement really is just terrible PR. The sub loss just justified the players' choices in leaving, whether it was for lack of new content, Garrisons, or poor PvP balance. Adding the mount to the shop just further justified them leaving and how bad the current situation is. Because, if they cared at all about getting players back, they could have spun it. They could have instead announced that they changed their minds, and are adding a special quest line to get the mount in-game. That at least would have been good PR.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Blizzard will make more money off the shop mount then getting a few players back for a month, and that just goes to shows where the game is heading. But I can't wait to see what the reaction will be like come BlizzCon if they announce the next expansion and the state of the game hasn't improved, because they sure as hell are not getting another 3 million players to come back at launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay? If I asked the art team to work in public relations while I was drinking I apologize as I don't remember that at all. I once asked a guy working at pizza hit to make me some gorditas after too many margaritas so I'll admit it's possible.<br />
<br />
It doesn't change the fact that Blizzard's only response to WoW's situation has been putting something in the store.<br />
<br />
Player's are saying something is wrong, they feel vindicated by the record sub loss. Blizz answers with a mount.<br />
<br />
The art team only makes art but how much of that as art ends up costing an extra $25 is a concern to some folks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When going to Twitch to check out some WoW streams it's almost comical to see this game getting beat in viewership by games such as World of Tanks,Runescape,Smite and Clash of Clans.... yes i said Clash of Clans. Multiple times i've seen Clash of Clans have more viewers than WoW... downright pathetic. The majority of your most well known players (most tend to be pvp'ers) have quit the game for good and the rest just put the game aside until Blizzard fixes the atrocity known as pvp. I really love WoW and have been an active player for nearly 9 years now and it saddens me to see the game heading in the terrible direction it is, we all know the game will one day die out but this franchise has a lot of life left in it due to all the possibilities and technology out there, the only bad part is Blizzard is blatantly letting it die and from the point of view of a lot of players we see that Blizzard just doesn't care like they used to and the only thing they focus on is how can the squeeze more money out of your pockets on things that are pretty much useless. <br />
<br />
That's my 2 cents and feel free to flame or be the obnoxious kid spilling worn out meme's.<br />

p.s. I really hope I'm wrong on all points and Blizzard gives us the WoW that we have been wanting and deserve. Cheers and happy gaming.</div></div><hr />

It's like they forgot they talking about a VIDEO game. You kind of have to be able to see the shit to play it. In this case at least.<br />

Besides, the artists that work on these clearly use the same software and have the same toolset as the ones that work on character/npc/gear/weapon models.

The mystic runesaber looks epic, i like it a lot ...but not enough to ditch out $25 specially if it can't fly in Draenor. Still thinking of helping thin more the sub-numbers for next quarter since i can't still freaking fly!</div></div><hr />

We are DIEING for something to do in game.<br />

Store mount is more expensive, but there's no chance that the mount will sell for more than 450 milllion every month. That would mean that about 2 million people out of 7 million would buy the mount every month.<br />
<br />
Not everyone pays anything like $15 a month.</div></div><hr />
