<br />
Gamescom Developer Q&amp;A<br />
Our friends at FatBossTV (https://www.youtube.com/user/FatbossTV/videos) had the chance to sit down with WatcherDev and talk about Patch 7.1 and Legion!<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v84480726&amp;!autoplay&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; width=&quot;900&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Patch 7.1<br />
<br />
Patch 7.1 has three major pieces: Karazhan, a small raid, and additional quests in Suramar. <br />
We will get a lot more detail on Patch 7.1 after Legion launches. <br />
Patch 7.1 was announced now to underscore the team's commitment to patch content as part of Legion. <br />
Karazhan is a Mythic dungeon (not Mythic+) with a weekly lockout. <br />
Karazhan is a long enough dungeon that some people might do part of it one night and then come back to finish it another night. <br />
Patch 6.2.3 was a pretty successful patch for what it was, mostly a systems patch that revitalized existing content and gave players a reason to revisit stuff. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Dungeons<br />
<br />
The old dungeon structure didn't give the team a good way to add dungeons that fit into the existing ecosystem of dungeons without stepping on the old ones. <br />
When ZA and ZG were introduced, they gave better loot than the older dungeons, so people went from running a diverse set of dungeons to running just the troll dungeons.<br />
With Mythic+ dungeons and Warforged/Titanforged gear in dungeons the team can add new dungeons that have a higher baseline difficulty and rewards that coexist the existing dungeons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Release Schedule<br />
<br />
There will be a blog post coming out in the next few days that has the full raid release schedule.<br />
The schedule will be similar to previous expansions, where everything is closed for the first three weeks, then Normal and Heroic Nightmare open, the PvP season begins, and Mythic keystones become available<br />
Nighthold is an early 2017 raid, towards the very beginning of 2017. <br />
In Warlords, it felt like Foundry came out too soon in relation to Highmaul for a lot of guilds and raid groups. The top end raiders were ready for it, but tons of other players were still working on it. Foundry came out and they felt rushed into that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic+ Dungeons<br />
<br />
The world first type raiders will be playing a lot the first few weeks of raiding. Instead of doing five split clears they may end up doing lots of Mythic+ dungeons, which isn't the end of the world. <br />
The average group will probably play through all of the Mythic keystones in the group and that is it. That might take 12 - 15 dungeon runs, which is longer than most guilds raid in a week.<br />
It would be easy to add a hard weekly lockout on Mythic keystones to prevent people from farming them for loot, but that would lead to people logging in on Tuesday, doing their Mythic run for the week, and being done. <br />
With keystones, if you log in later in the week and have a fresh keystone ready to go, people will be lining up to run the dungeon with you. <br />
Currently rewards cap out at Mythic+ 10, which rewards gear that is roughly on par with Heroic Nightmare gear. The real reward comes from the weekly chest, rewarding the mythic raid gear. <br />
<br />
<br />
Legendary Items<br />
<br />
There is a little bit of tuning still to be done on the legendary items that are outliers. <br />
There will still be some items that are the best and some that are the worst. <br />
The legendary items are a chance to try out interesting effects that aren't just a damage throughput increase. <br />
If you are someone that never sets foot in a raid zone, getting a legendary item should still be exciting for you. <br />
There are some legendary items that are amazing in a raid over a long fight that aren't as useful for a player that is just soloing in the world. A more utility related legendary might be a huge deal for that player. <br />
There are plans to add more legendary items as the expansion progresses. <br />
The team decided not to start out with a system that allowed you to target a specific legendary item. <br />
As more are added, there will be some threshold at which there are so many out there that it feels like you can't reasonably expect to get any of the specific ones you want. At that point being able to target certain legendary items will make sense. <br />
<br />
<br />
Artifact Weapons<br />
<br />
The team will avoid nerfing a spec from being a little too good to the worst so that you don't feel that all of your Artifact progression was a waste. <br />
Artifacts are something that will continue to grow and evolve so that Artifact Power matters for the entirety of Legion.<br />
Classes are balanced against each other without Artifacts or Legendary items. The Artifacts and Legendary items are then balanced against each other separately. <br />
<br />
<br />
Melee vs Ranged<br />
<br />
In Mythic+ dungeons melee do really well thanks to their cleave and mobility compared to casters that have to stand still. <br />
Melee may be a little stronger in Mythic+ dungeons while ranged are a little stronger in raids, which is fine as long as the gap isn't too large.<br />
The team doesn't want to solve the melee vs ranged problem by making life boring for melee and making raid mechanics that don't target them at all.<br />
The community doesn't do a great job when something is 1% better and they claim it is the only viable option and everything else is garbage. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ability Pruning<br />
<br />
You prune a plant to guide its growth in new directions that are hopefully more aesthetically pleasing. It is removing stuff to make room to add new stuff. <br />
One of the themes of Legion class design is to emphasize strengths and weaknesses of classes. <br />
A lot of the things that were removed were removed after looking back at classes over the years where the class designers had taken the easy route. The team was coming up with a new set of abilities for an expansion or needed new talents and asked themselves what that class needed. If a class wasn't very mobile, they gave them a talent row with mobility options. Players thought this was amazing and what they always wanted, but that led to a lot of homogenization. <br />
In a world where no one has weaknesses there are also no strengths. <br />
In Legion there is now room to add interesting utility, especially for specs that feel like they don't bring much beyond their throughput. <br />
Bring the player, not the class was a reaction to the hyper regimented raid structure of Burning Crusade where buffs were party based and synergy was more important than anything else. <br />
The team would like to get back to a place where if you are a PuG leader, you are looking at your raid comp and saying, &quot;We could really use a Hunter, let's look for a good hunter&quot;, rather than &quot;Let's look for any ranged DPS, especially the flavor of the month that is 2% better and thus is the only viable one&quot;. Obviously this isn't the case literally right now, but it is what the team is thinking about and would like to move towards over the course of patches and future content. <br />
<br />
<br />
Expansion Launches<br />
<br />
There is a lot that has been done by the server team and how the world is designed that will make the Legion launch smoother than the Warlords launch. <br />
Zones scale in level so the population will be distributed across the different zones. <br />
Under heavy load there will also be multiple versions of the same zone on the same server to make sure that server performance is okay and gameplay feels good. <br />
One of the things that caused problems for servers at Warlords launch, especially on the Horde side, was the Spyglass that was needed to start the Horde Garrison. It was only usable by one player at a time, which caused a bit of a bottleneck. <br />
The team hotfixed the Spyglass to be usable by multiple players at a time, but something went wrong with the hofix and then no one could use the Spyglass! <br />
Horde players in North America were all stuck there for a few hours until the team could fix it, resulting in a big clump of players all hitting the garrison at the same time, making server problems much worse. <br />
Everyone on the server was doing Frostfire at the same time, resulting in a laggy zone and even more players building up there, making things even worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Structure and Rewards<br />
<br />
The current raid structure didn't change this expansion because there isn't a huge problem to fix. All of the raid structure changes in previous expansions were targeted at solving a particular problem. <br />
Classic to Burning Crusade changed because the logistics of 40 man raiding were overwhelming for a lot of guilds, players were a cog in the giant raid machine. &quot;Your job is to dispel this one person and that is your only job in this giant 40 player group&quot;. It was fun for the raid leader to plan all of that out but less fun for the players.<br />
The introduction of 10 player raiding allowed the team to let more types of players and groups experience the content. <br />
Flexible raiding is probably the best raid structure the team has done and is working well. <br />
Three difficulties plus Raid Finder means that there is a raid difficulty for all of the different groups. Normal for friends, family, and PuGs. Heroic for guilds that are formed for the purpose of raiding, Mythic for the extremely hardcore players. <br />
Mythic needed a fixed size so that tuning could be done in a way that is satisfying. <br />
Being able to split the raid into groups that could go off and do a mechanic and assuming that the raid had one of every class was part of the encounters that the team wanted to design for Mythic, so the 20 player size felt like the right number. A smaller group size such as 15 players might have also worked, but that would have been tougher for the groups that were already at 25. <br />
The team was worried that LFR was growing too much in prominence in some ways, so they wanted to make sure that players were doing regular group raiding didn't also feel obligated to do lots of Raid Finder to complement that. The team probably overdid this in Warlords by removing Tier sets from Raid Finder, so they are coming back to Raid Finder in Legion. <br />
Most of the players that are raiding competitively will already have set pieces before that Raid Finder wing opens, so they won't feel obligated to go and do it when it opens. <br />
If you have been really unlucky and want your set bonus, this gives you another chance to go and get that last piece. <br />
<br />

Warcraft Movie - Additional Scene<br />
An additional scene that wasn't in the theater release of the Warcraft Movie was posted today! Duncan Jones confirmed (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/766675899999776768) that this is one of the extra scenes on the DVD that releases on September 27th (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01GUVOXIW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20).<br />

Shame. It's a small scene that added a lot of depth to Blackhand and Grommash. Obviously it had to be cut.<br />

The actual problem was raiders crying that their raid leaders forced them to do LFR for VALOR, not gear. They were'nt running LFR for the gimped LFR gear sets. How Ion can not get this is astounding to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And wait! Is the 7.1 Karazhan dungeon Mythic-only?! What the hell?!?! I don't do Mythic dungeons, so does that mean I'm barred from doing this content?! Why the hell would Blizzard only allow one difficulty for this first part of major content, and shut non-hardcore (in the highest difficulty sense of the term, rather than time spent) players out? Absolutely awful move by Blizzard. I got my hopes up for being able to loosely trust them again, and this is taking that away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grom, didn't he got Doomhammered in one of the scenes in the movie, or was it a different guy? Still, funny.<br />
No, that was just a random Orc (I believe in the novelisation he's named as a Bleeding Hollow Orc). Grom could be found throughout the film, especially during Callan's death scene and the final battle after Llane's death and Blackhand's death.<br />
<br />
<br />
Their voices sounds different from the Movie<br />
As someone else has suggested, it most likely got cut before the audio was finalised. Personally I prefer their voices without such heavy audio effects, as you can actually understand what they say first time round! In the theatrical cut, the dialogue was far more difficult to make out than they should have been, as a result of the heavy alterations. While the voices sound too un-Orc-like without, I wish they had stopped at a halfway point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Understand this if you can, (I know it may be hard for you).. Emerald Nightmare raid has no Tier so it is like what Highmaul was a leg up raid for gearing purposes.. Nighthold is the first tier raid and as such is Tier 19.. The raid mentioned for 7.1 is supposed to be more of a lore type raid (think of Ruby Sanctum) as it is supposed to tie up the main questline story in Stormheim.. <br />
<br />
Now you got all that? Good now since we have been told that there are supposedly going to be three tiers this xpac then we have Tiers 20 and 21 to follow and will come out five and ten months after the release of Nighthold..<br />
<br />
Understand now? Hopefully you do (but I doubt it) because your post is complete load of bollocks..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why does it matter if it is called Mythic, Heroic or Normal? They can just call it a Normal dungeon and make it insanely hard. Having a really challenging dungeon also makes it relevant for all those small groups who want a meaningful challenge without having to raid. <br />
<br />
If you don't like it, don't do it. Just wait for LFR to grab some loot.</div></div><hr />

This is how they pushed rated BG's. YOU WILL LIKE RATED BG'S OR WE WILL MAKE SURE YOU CAN'T PROGRESS!<br />

The rest of the quotes are from the page, not you specifically.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Because let's add MORE RNG to unlucky people... that'll do it!<br />

<br />
The team would like to get back to a place where if you are a PuG leader, you are looking at your raid comp and saying, &quot;We could really use a Hunter, let's look for a good hunter&quot;, rather than &quot;Let's look for any ranged DPS, especially the flavor of the month that is 2% better and thus is the only viable one&quot;. Obviously this isn't the case literally right now, but it is what the team is thinking about and would like to move towards over the course of patches and future content.<br />
<br />
I hope they don't fuck this up, like they usually do, and take the &quot;we can only get a hunter&quot;. I'd be happy with &quot;we could really use a hunter&quot; but only if they added &quot;but if we HAD to we could also take a laser turkey or warlock&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Melee may be a little stronger in Mythic+ dungeons while ranged are a little stronger in raids, which is fine as long as the gap isn't too large.<br />
<br />
So long as nothing is ever again like the invasion crap we're seeing now where the melee get roflstomped.<br />
<br />
<br />
In Warlords, it felt like Foundry came out too soon in relation to Highmaul for a lot of guilds and raid groups. The top end raiders were ready for it, but tons of other players were still working on it. Foundry came out and they felt rushed into that.<br />
<br />
This would be less of a deal if they kept pumping out content at the same rate. People would get used to it. They stopped making new content and, basically, quite working on WoD and focused primarily on Legion which is what rubbed a lot of people wrong and is also why I don't trust their promise for more content.<br />
<br />
<br />
The old dungeon structure didn't give the team a good way to add dungeons that fit into the existing ecosystem of dungeons without stepping on the old ones.<br />
<br />
Bullshit. Dragon Soul catch-up dungeons worked just fine and let newer players get an entry into raiding much quicker.<br />
<br />
<br />
Three difficulties plus Raid Finder means that there is a raid difficulty for all of the different groups. Normal for friends, family, and PuGs. Heroic for guilds that are formed for the purpose of raiding, Mythic for the extremely hardcore players.<br />
<br />
I know going Mythic definitely destroyed a lot of competition on Ghostlands. Merging 2x 10-man groups was disastrous and the majority of the competitive guilds died from it. The aftermath turned into no one wanted any harder than normal and occasionally heroic because finding people with the gear for Mythic was a nightmare and gearing people up almost always ended up badly when someone left.</div></div><hr />

Other way round Blizzard. Foundry couldn't have come out sooner so we could say bye bye to that shithole that was Highmaul.</div></div><hr />

This. People aren't used to thinking of mythic 5 mans this way, but remember that since the keystone system escalates difficulty over time, that this means the entry level of mythic has to bend closer to heroic by nature. This allows many more players into the system so they can progress.</div></div><hr />

So the problem is literally just that it is called Mythic? It could be called Legendacularly Impossibru for all the worth a title gives.<br />

Mythic-only just lets people know its tuned harder than normal dungeons, rather than have them go in there expecting a cakewalk and then shitposting on the forums when they can't clear it.</div></div><hr />

As it should be to encourage people to step out of HC while the current HC's we have have that small chance to award helpful gear among with LFR and World boss gear to help you into Mythic. Baseline Mythic is easy enough. Mythic + will be where the challenge and greater reward is.</div></div><hr />

Not that it's even hard to get into Legion Mythics. It's perfectly simple; 830 ilvl will pretty much make you good to go. You can get that ilvl just doing heroics and world quests. The only thing you will need is a tank and/or healer with the third artifact slot filled.</div></div><hr />

Because it will award gear capable of doing Mythic dungeons. As I also said Heroic dungeons have a chance for gear to upgrade to be decent enough and world bosses will help you. LFR is just one option.</div></div><hr />

The reason why it is Mythic only is mainly because it has 9 bosses. Remember, Heroic dungeons reset every day. Mythic dungeons reset weekly. In the interview, Ion said he expects people to clear some of the dungeon on one day, and the rest later. If they made Kara a Heroic dungeon, it would mean people would have to commit a large amount of time to clear it in one sitting. This would mean a lot of people would not be able to clear it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keile</div><div class="date">2016-08-19, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are basically making Kara into a 5man Mini-Raid by making it a really long 5 man that is Mythic only.<br />
<br />
And I kinda like that idea.<br />
<br />
And for those having an issue with it: Get a guild, make some friends, and get groups together. Seriously, why is it an issue getting into Mythic 5 mans? People pug them all the time now, and I guarantee they will be doing so in Legion.</div></div><hr />

But whatever, the LFR change is what I'm really happy about, getting a stat-stick trinket and stat-stick-esque &quot;sets&quot; sucked, I'll be happy with the pauper version of the tier sets, after all, I'm not putting in the time to learn the fights like real raiders. Most won't agree, and that's fine, but the change makes me happy.</div></div><hr />

i think you missed what i talking about.<br />
LFR was changed in WoD to push people into normal+ raids. even with better gear, pets, and mounts it didnt change anything. it most likely made it worse. also the changes to LFR made people pissed and it started to fail itself.<br />

so i will ask again, how does making it mythic only get people into running it?</div></div><hr />

Emerald Nightmare raid has no Tier so it is like what Highmaul was a leg up raid for gearing purposes.. Nighthold is the first tier raid and as such is Tier 19.. The raid mentioned for 7.1 is supposed to be more of a lore type raid (think of Ruby Sanctum) as it is supposed to tie up the main questline story in Stormheim.. <br />
<br />
Now you got all that? Good now since we have been told that there are supposedly going to be three tiers this xpac then we have Tiers 20 and 21 to follow and will come out five and ten months after the release of Nighthold..<br />
<br />
Understand now? Hopefully you do (but I doubt it) because your post is complete load of bollocks..<br />

keep telling this to yourself - all the time till this point in 2018 when you will finally realise that after nighthold there will be only 1 raid left :)</div></div><hr />

It was great to read in the novelisation, and I was looking forward to seeing it on the home release, and this early online release is very unexpected! There have been more bonus features uploaded today, but I'm going to stop myself watching them, and wait to see them on the official release.<br />
<br />
And wait! Is the 7.1 Karazhan dungeon Mythic-only?! What the hell?!?! I don't do Mythic dungeons, so does that mean I'm barred from doing this content?! Why the hell would Blizzard only allow one difficulty for this first part of major content, and shut non-hardcore (in the highest difficulty sense of the term, rather than time spent) players out? Absolutely awful move by Blizzard. I got my hopes up for being able to loosely trust them again, and this is taking that away.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, that was just a random Orc (I believe in the novelisation he's named as a Bleeding Hollow Orc). Grom could be found throughout the film, especially during Callan's death scene and the final battle after Llane's death and Blackhand's death.<br />
<br />
<br />
As someone else has suggested, it most likely got cut before the audio was finalised. Personally I prefer their voices without such heavy audio effects, as you can actually understand what they say first time round! In the theatrical cut, the dialogue was far more difficult to make out than they should have been, as a result of the heavy alterations. While the voices sound too un-Orc-like without, I wish they had stopped at a halfway point.<br />

In the interview, it says it won't be Mythic+ (at least not initially), and if they did make it Mythic+ in the future, they would probably split it up in the multiple dungeons.</div></div><hr />

there is no way for it not to be mythic+ though. Considering how long it is gonna take to clear , they will have to up the ilvl of the drops for ppl to even consider doing it rather then doing 2 mythic+es which would take the same time more or less.</div></div><hr />

well based on the info yesterday:<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.1 - Return to Karazhan<br />
<br />
<br />
Karazhan is coming back as a large five player dungeon with all nine bosses.<br />
The old Karazhan will still exist, you can still go and farm it for things.<br />
There will also be a small additional raid between The Emerald Nightmare and The Nighthold that wraps up the Stormheim story.<br />
Patch 7.1 will also have outdoor content associated with Suramar that pushes forward the Nightfallen story.<br />
Patch 7.1 is coming to the PTR right after Legion launches!<br />
Encounters have been play tested internally, it is good to go.</div></div><hr />

Well that is kind of the point of Mythic. To get off your arse instead of instant gratification. And heroic dungeon gear has a chance to award very decent gear now so you can do that along with LFR for easy gear. And world bosses.</div></div><hr />

That's the &quot;problem&quot; for me also. But tbh i can't whine about it. I have the time, but no interest to actually form groups. Oh well, some heroic 5-mans and world quests for me then.</div></div><hr />

The team was coming up with a new set of abilities for an expansion or needed new talents and asked themselves what that class needed. If a class wasn't very mobile, they gave them a talent row with mobility options. Players thought this was amazing and what they always wanted, but that led to a lot of homogenization.<br />

Well since you won't actually give a reason that is what we will do :). I mean god forbid you have to make a group, are too bad at mythics or your gear is too crap to enter them. :)<br />

Judging by the way he talks to people, and how he's banned I'm guessing he's extremely anti social and the idea of having to talk to someone in game to get into the dungeon is his problem here.</div></div><hr />

I think the issue is that it so long. Basically they don't want to get into a situation where you have people jumping ship like mad all the time, similar to what happened with Occulus.<br />
<br />
This will give you a chance to form a group that is willing to either do it all, or do it in chunks.<br />
<br />
Just from his comments on gear, I have a feeling Kara will have gear slightly better than those at launch, but not so high as to negate mythic/mythic+. This gives them the room to adjust gear levels as the expansion goes on without making the old ones completely obsolete. <br />
<br />
Forming groups these days is not that hard since they released the group finder tool. I've found it to be much quicker than waiting on a queue most of the time.<br />

If the general mythic is around the same difficulty as the WoD ones, they are far from being exclusively for the hard core (hence why most of the dungeons excluding Kara have keystone Mythic+ for actual difficulty). They are entirely doable if you choose to do them, but Blizz can't hold your hand through making that choice.</div></div><hr />

Lol, as if mythic dungeons were intended for hardcore audience in the first place. Pro tip: they are not and they were not in Warlords of Draenor. What is designed to appeal to hardcore audience is high level mythic+ dungeons and Karazhan is not part of that system. So what is your problem? Entitlement, perhaps?</div></div><hr />

The challenge will come from higher levels.</div></div><hr />

I don't get the &quot;WAAAAH ITS MYTHIC&quot; crowd. Just because it has a scary name doesn't make it hard. The only reason you could have had any problem whatsoever in WoD Mythic dungeons was bad gear( go to Ashran etc) or an aversion to the LFG groups (get a tougher skin). Group finder or guild is all you need.</div></div><hr />

Remember, Heroic dungeons reset every day. Mythic dungeons reset weekly. In the interview, Ion said he expects people to clear some of the dungeon on one day, and the rest later. If they made Kara a Heroic dungeon, it would mean people would have to commit a large amount of time to clear it in one sitting. This would mean a lot of people would not be able to clear it.<br />
<br />
Wings. Like with every other big dungeon in WoW. Blackrocks, Stratholme, Scarlet cloister or whatever it's name was, I believe even Scholo. Some were completely revamped, but others still have the wings afaik.<br />
<br />
I am an extreme opponent of locking content behind an arbitrary progression gate. Dungeon Finder and LFR are a blessing for people who just want to experience the content without having to put in a lot of time trying to actively find groups or farming gear to be good enough. Yes, I was 16 once too and had all the time in the world. That is no longer the case. LFR is already a large time commitment, finding a premade group if you are not part of any guild nor have any friends still playing the game, because of said time commitments or other reasons simply means that some people will not experience content that took a lot of time and resources to make. Why? Nobody knows, because you can STILL make a Mythic +(+++++++++) mode for ANY dungeon. There is literally no reason to make a dungeon mythic only. It just doesn't make any sense.<br />
<br />
Some people just wanna see the stuff and experience the lore. I stopped bothering about loot long ago...</div></div><hr />

Considering how long it is gonna take to clear , they will have to up the ilvl of the drops for ppl to even consider doing it rather then doing 2 mythic+es which would take the same time more or less.<br />
<br />
This is what I don't get. The difficulty is equivalent to WoD heroics so why the hell can we not queue for it? I think an attunement like there is for suramar dungeons is more than enough. I don't want to spam every channel or apply for on group find we for groups that can be just as bad as if I queued for through lfg.</div></div><hr />

Why not have just named it heroic+ and had only the base heroic queuable with LFD? Or they could have just disabled stones being used in LFD. Instead, they kept the &quot;mythic&quot; name which many associate with hard, especially when it comes to mythic raiding. It's hard to change first impressions and players already have their first impression of mythic mode with WoD. Just slapping a &quot;+&quot; on it won't change people's impressions.<br />
<br />
It's no surprise people are pissed by this. Karazhan is supposed to tie heavily into Legion lore which also has many understandably upset. How is Kara being mythic only different than having Cho'gall be in mythic only Highmaul? Blizzard's finishing a story in content that many likely won't see.<br />
<br />
Every time I see something from Legion, it seems to be one step forward and two steps back. Many wanted to see Karazhan again (I wasn't among them but whatever). Now Blizzard's putting a gate on it by saying you have to either make your own group (which many won't do for one reason or another), hope you can get into someone else's group, or just not do it. That's not right. Putting something highly desired behind something that's effectively impossible for many isn't fair. The Grove Warden was just downright insulting after people begged during the 2008 Olympics for a moose. Adding the regular moose mounts in Legion doesn't change the bitter taste left by the Grove Warden (which was originally a store mount).<br />
<br />
Also can't say I'm happy Blizzard's effectively going back to &quot;bring the class, not the player&quot;. So much for playing the class you want to play. If you want to do something, better hope you're on a desired class. DHs were already screwed due to how many want to play them. Once Legion's out, DHs won't be wanted at all. Then the theoretical worst DPS classes and specs will get kicked to the curb while the best spec for the worst class might only be brought for their utility. The worst healers will likely be ditched in favor of the best DPS spec they have. Same for tanks. Blizzard's making a BIG mistake. I have to wonder how fast they go back on it, but considering WoD ... we're going to be in for a few long and frustrating expansion unless Legion gets cut short like WoD did.</div></div><hr />

As someone pointed out earlier, mythic really isn't as hard as it sounds. It's more like heroic and a half degree more difficulty. It's the mythic+ stuff that is intended for those that wish to actually test their skill. In return, they earn better rewards.</div></div><hr />

Why is this a bad thing? Blizzard might actually be trying to foster the growth of guilds, which is not a bad thing.

Same here - except that it's puggable as well. <br />
<br />
Put some effort into a guild, maybe it will pay off for you, and then you'll have access to all of the content. If Blizzard is going to encourage guilds again, that's a HUGE item on the &quot;Good Things&quot; list.</div></div><hr />

It's not Blizzard's fault that you refuse to join a guild and I'm guessing have no friends to play with? WoW is a MMORPG, and that's the concept Blizzard builds most of their content almost completely around. While I also like playing solo because the bulk of the community is rotten toxic to the core, I still managed to find a few people that I can play the game with outside of my pretty much defunct guild. You want to play group content? You're pretty much required to make some friends. All you need are four other people for mythic dungeons. Or get used to PuGs. It's your choice. Otherwise you may have to come to the realization that WoW may not be the kind of game you're looking for.</div></div><hr />

So you are complaining about having to join a guild.... in an MMORPG? For crying out loud what has the modern &quot;gamer&quot; become?<br />
<br />
I'm gonna say this once to people like you: It is not Blizzard that is dumb for gating stuff behind difficulty, it is you that is dumb for playing an MMORPG when you don't have the time schedule or social abilities for it.<br />
<br />
You don't join a karting club for 30 minutes a week and expect to drive a Formula 1 car. You don't join a saturday amateur football club and expect to play against Lionel Messi. You don't join a monthly housewives cooking club and expect to win master chef. <br />
You don't play an MMORPG for 30 minutes a week and expect to get ALL the freaking rewards and see everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's enough games on the market that target a casual audience, heck there's even some MMO's that do that. Please stop trying to cater WoW to your playstyle and ruin it for everyone else. The game was as it's highpoint both content and player numbers wise when it was more hardcore. Ever since the uber-casuals started coming in and claiming they are the majority, it has been going downhill in content and player numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm gonna say this once to people like you: It is not Blizzard that is dumb for gating stuff behind difficulty, it is you that is dumb for playing an MMORPG when you don't have the time schedule or social abilities for it.<br />
<br />
You don't join a karting club for 30 minutes a week and expect to drive a Formula 1 car. You don't join a saturday amateur football club and expect to play against Lionel Messi. You don't join a monthly housewives cooking club and expect to win master chef. <br />
You don't play an MMORPG for 30 minutes a week and expect to get ALL the freaking rewards and see everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's enough games on the market that target a casual audience, heck there's even some MMO's that do that. Please stop trying to cater WoW to your playstyle and ruin it for everyone else. The game was as it's highpoint both content and player numbers wise when it was more hardcore. Ever since the uber-casuals started coming in and claiming they are the majority, it has been going downhill in content and player numbers.<br />
<br />
Thank you, this is exactly my sentiment about the game. If I don't have the time to go hardcore, I certainly don't expect to get the same kind of rewards as a hardcore Mythic raider, but I'm more than content with my small returning group of friends who run mythic dungeons with me.</div></div><hr />

WoW is a MMORPG, and that's the concept Blizzard builds most of their content almost completely around. While I also like playing solo because the bulk of the community is rotten toxic to the core, I still managed to find a few people that I can play the game with outside of my pretty much defunct guild. You want to play group content? You're pretty much required to make some friends. All you need are four other people for mythic dungeons. Or get used to PuGs. It's your choice. Otherwise you may have to come to the realization that WoW may not be the kind of game you're looking for.<br />
<br />
The issue isn't that you have to join a guild to do mythic, the issue is you have to commit in order to raid in that difficulty.<br />
<br />
Meaning, due to how the gear system works in wow, you have to commit a set number of evening to play and to stick to it in order to play with a guild (else you ll either fall behind your guild or will get benched).You can't play 5 evening a week in mythic raid if you want then the next week 0, then the next week 3, and so on. By joining a mythic raiding guild you loose the freedom to decide how much you want to play WoW. <br />
<br />
Generally the serious raiding guild will expect you to guarantee your schedule over several month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am an extreme opponent of locking content behind an arbitrary progression gate. Dungeon Finder and LFR are a blessing for people who just want to experience the content without having to put in a lot of time trying to actively find groups or farming gear to be good enough. Yes, I was 16 once too and had all the time in the world. That is no longer the case. LFR is already a large time commitment, finding a premade group if you are not part of any guild nor have any friends still playing the game, because of said time commitments or other reasons simply means that some people will not experience content that took a lot of time and resources to make. Why? Nobody knows, because you can STILL make a Mythic +(+++++++++) mode for ANY dungeon. There is literally no reason to make a dungeon mythic only. It just doesn't make any sense.<br />
<br />
Some people just wanna see the stuff and experience the lore. I stopped bothering about loot long ago...<br />
<br />
Watching tv might be a better use of your time. You aren't entitled to the content. If you buy Dark Souls that doesn't mean you get to experience the whole game and story. You still need skill to beat it. If you're not going to play the game you don't get shit, end of discussion.</div></div><hr />

There is an easy mode. It's called Skyrim on Legendary :). Also anyone crying about Mythic only then here is your solution. Run it with friends or join a guild to find people to do it with because they won't be changing the way it works because you are crying about actually having to put some legwork in. Also gear wise you have many other sources to farm such as LFR, World bosses, World quests and since the gear has a chance to upgrade to a way higher ilvl now Heroic dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The rest of the quotes are from the page, not you specifically. <br />
<br />
Literally anyone is capable of doing basic Mythic dungeons. It will be no harder than say the original Kara raid.<br />
Not even remotely comparable to rated BGs which require a high degree of organization and time investment. <br />
<br />
You can do basic Mythic 1 in 820-825 gear, Heroic dungeons and world quests. Any uber casual can easily do this.<br />
Just because you can't hop in in greens and roflstomp it like LFR doesn't mean it is &quot;gated&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because let's add MORE RNG to unlucky people... that'll do it!<br />
<br />
So in essence you don't want the key mechanic of an MMORPG/RPG, which is hunting loot. You just want it by default. K.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope they don't fuck this up, like they usually do, and take the &quot;we can only get a hunter&quot;. I'd be happy with &quot;we could really use a hunter&quot; but only if they added &quot;but if we HAD to we could also take a laser turkey or warlock&quot;.<br />
<br />
As usual these perceptions come more from the community than actual game facts. He was clearly talking about how the situation of TBC was not something they ever want to return to (ie we only need class X). So no clue how you jump to the fear that this might be the case again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So long as nothing is ever again like the invasion crap we're seeing now where the melee get roflstomped.<br />
<br />
What in the world are you even talking about. I mean, if you're referring to charging in on BOSSES as a melee DPS and getting oneshot, because they need to be TANKED.....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This would be less of a deal if they kept pumping out content at the same rate. People would get used to it. They stopped making new content and, basically, quite working on WoD and focused primarily on Legion which is what rubbed a lot of people wrong and is also why I don't trust their promise for more content.<br />
<br />
We've literally already got confirmation of more content in the first 4 months of Legion than the entire first year of WoD. I mean, sure be skeptical of what comes after if you like, but facts are facts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bullshit. Dragon Soul catch-up dungeons worked just fine and let newer players get an entry into raiding much quicker.<br />
<br />
That wasn't the point of that answer. He was talking about adding new dungeons WITHOUT making the older ones utterly pointless. As was the case with ZA/ZG and End Time dungeons in Cata. With Mythic+ dungeons can be kept relevant for the entirety of the expansion, and you can add dungeons without making them the exclusive 5 man content for that Tier.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I know going Mythic definitely destroyed a lot of competition on Ghostlands. Merging 2x 10-man groups was disastrous and the majority of the competitive guilds died from it. The aftermath turned into no one wanted any harder than normal and occasionally heroic because finding people with the gear for Mythic was a nightmare and gearing people up almost always ended up badly when someone left.<br />
<br />
He addressed this in another answer. They had a choice, they decided affecting the 10m groups more would cause less of an issue than shifting the weight of changing to 25m groups down to 15. In essence, the assumption was that increasing your team size or merging to 20m was baseline easier to accomplish than 15 people having to suddenly form a new team or hope to get picked elsewhere.<br />
<br />
You're also quoting an answer about the general success of the various difficulties, but only talking about Mythic raid size.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's so not true. TBC turned into &quot;bring the destro lock/BM hunter, not the class&quot; since both performed above everything else through either a single button rotation [destro shadow bolt spam] or single button macro use [hunters]. With how Sunwell ended up providing the Naaru zone wide INT and STA buffs you no longer needed to bring mages and spriests for damage as locks would again perform better due to their inherent shadow resistance abilities that so many bosses [especially Kil'Jaeden] would use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So...why complain about seeing stuff and experiencing lore?<br />
There is no arbitrary gating to Mythic dungeons except your own unwillingness to use group finder or literally ask anyone you know in your guild or friendlist. Everyone will have the gear required by default simply by doing HC dungeons and world quests.<br />
<br />
This is not hardcore content, nor is it gated behind anything. If anything, you should be ecstatic that there will be more content directed exactly at your type of player - more content you can do with almost no prerequisites.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard poorly named mythic+ if they wanted players to understand it starts at roughly heroic mode. Why not have just named it heroic+ and had only the base heroic queuable with LFD? Or they could have just disabled stones being used in LFD. Instead, they kept the &quot;mythic&quot; name which many associate with hard, especially when it comes to mythic raiding. It's hard to change first impressions and players already have their first impression of mythic mode with WoD. Just slapping a &quot;+&quot; on it won't change people's impressions.<br />
<br />
It's no surprise people are pissed by this. Karazhan is supposed to tie heavily into Legion lore which also has many understandably upset. How is Kara being mythic only different than having Cho'gall be in mythic only Highmaul? Blizzard's finishing a story in content that many likely won't see.<br />
<br />
Every time I see something from Legion, it seems to be one step forward and two steps back. Many wanted to see Karazhan again (I wasn't among them but whatever). Now Blizzard's putting a gate on it by saying you have to either make your own group (which many won't do for one reason or another), hope you can get into someone else's group, or just not do it. That's not right. Putting something highly desired behind something that's effectively impossible for many isn't fair. The Grove Warden was just downright insulting after people begged during the 2008 Olympics for a moose. Adding the regular moose mounts in Legion doesn't change the bitter taste left by the Grove Warden (which was originally a store mount).<br />
<br />
Also can't say I'm happy Blizzard's effectively going back to &quot;bring the class, not the player&quot;. So much for playing the class you want to play. If you want to do something, better hope you're on a desired class. DHs were already screwed due to how many want to play them. Once Legion's out, DHs won't be wanted at all. Then the theoretical worst DPS classes and specs will get kicked to the curb while the best spec for the worst class might only be brought for their utility. The worst healers will likely be ditched in favor of the best DPS spec they have. Same for tanks. Blizzard's making a BIG mistake. I have to wonder how fast they go back on it, but considering WoD ... we're going to be in for a few long and frustrating expansion unless Legion gets cut short like WoD did.<br />
<br />
That is absolutely not what he said at all. He clearly stated that &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; was something they over-emphazised at a time when the model from TBC was at the opposite extreme end of the spectrum (ie we NEED class X, Y and Z but not two of X).<br />
<br />
He very clearly stated that there is a lot of room between that extreme - which they do not want to return to ever again and they find problematic - and homogenizing all classes so class choice becomes virtually irrelevant (bring whatever, it doesn't matter). The goal here is to give each spec/class strengths that are desirable without locking setup choices into cookie cutter setups that cannot be deviated from. And they are continuing to iterate on this in the future.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
That's not my point. as someone who used to raid, I enjoyed it, however I don't anymore, that's fine, raids are optional(LFR is the alternative) but with Mythic dungeons being optional aswell, but there being no other version of that content (which of course is what i'm worried about; content. Seeing as WoD lacked so much of it i'm looking at the big picture of stuff I'll actually have to do come legion) No one wants to do pugs either, they rarely go well so if you want a clean, successful mythic dungeon done you will now have to join guilds etc. It just seems unnecessary and I'm hoping it doesn't backfire too hard for blizzard. From what I've seen, no one wants Mythic only dungeons.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem here is one of perception.<br />
<br />
Mythic dungeons are not hardcore content, are not gated behind anything, and are doable in very very low gear levels. Mythic1 in Legion is comparable to Heroics from WoD.<br />
<br />
You do not need a guild to do a basic Mythic dungeon - this notion is frankly laughable. It's barely harder than a Heroic in Legion.</div></div><hr />

But I think that's the primary issue here. It doesn't matter how hard or easy Mythics actually are in Legion or that even in WoD now they're not all that much harder than Heroics; the word &quot;Mythic&quot; itself has a certain connotation -- because Mythic difficulty was introduced to give the top tier (or, let's say, better-than-average) players harder content -- and thusly many players have already determined that &quot;Mythic&quot; means &quot;beyond my skill level&quot; and therefore won't even try.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is pushing players toward Mythics, and that's fine. But where do they go from here? In the expansion after Legion, Mythic++ because &quot;Mythic+ is only a little bit harder than Mythic&quot;? It's becoming absurd.</div></div><hr />

True, it's an unfortunate aura of exclusivity that has been tied to the term &quot;Mythic&quot; by now - even though Mythic dungeons in WoD were no more exclusive either.<br />
<br />
They'd probably be better off striking Heroic or Normal difficulty, or simply finding a better term for Mythic.<br />
<br />
However, that's mostly discussing marketing appearances. People that actually play the game quickly figure out what's what for themselves.</div></div><hr />

This is sorta where my issue is coming in, they call it Mythic, but it's basically Heroic, so why not just call it Heroic and let us queue for it? The only issue I have with Mythic is that it's not queueable, which is made more frustrating by people saying, but it's basically just heroic so don't assume it's hard to do. Well then why not have it queueable in that case?</div></div><hr />

There have been more bonus features uploaded today, but I'm going to stop myself watching them, and wait to see them on the official release.<br />
<br />
And wait! Is the 7.1 Karazhan dungeon Mythic-only?! What the hell?!?! I don't do Mythic dungeons, so does that mean I'm barred from doing this content?! Why the hell would Blizzard only allow one difficulty for this first part of major content, and shut non-hardcore (in the highest difficulty sense of the term, rather than time spent) players out? Absolutely awful move by Blizzard. I got my hopes up for being able to loosely trust them again, and this is taking that away.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, that was just a random Orc (I believe in the novelisation he's named as a Bleeding Hollow Orc). Grom could be found throughout the film, especially during Callan's death scene and the final battle after Llane's death and Blackhand's death.<br />

As someone else has suggested, it most likely got cut before the audio was finalised. Personally I prefer their voices without such heavy audio effects, as you can actually understand what they say first time round! In the theatrical cut, the dialogue was far more difficult to make out than they should have been, as a result of the heavy alterations. While the voices sound too un-Orc-like without, I wish they had stopped at a halfway point.<br />

Assumptions from something you didn't understand and a mile and a half from what i was talking about, but i guess there is no cure for stupidity. They admitted to willingly nerf a class from best to worst. Pretty stupid thing to admit not trying to balance the class instead of just nerfing it completely to the ground.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ElDoorO</div><div class="date">2016-08-21, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Literally anyone is capable of doing basic Mythic dungeons. It will be no harder than say the original Kara raid.<br />
Not even remotely comparable to rated BGs which require a high degree of organization and time investment. <br />
<br />
You can do basic Mythic 1 in 820-825 gear, Heroic dungeons and world quests. Any uber casual can easily do this.<br />
Just because you can't hop in in greens and roflstomp it like LFR doesn't mean it is &quot;gated&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So in essence you don't want the key mechanic of an MMORPG/RPG, which is hunting loot. You just want it by default. K.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As usual these perceptions come more from the community than actual game facts. He was clearly talking about how the situation of TBC was not something they ever want to return to (ie we only need class X). So no clue how you jump to the fear that this might be the case again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What in the world are you even talking about. I mean, if you're referring to charging in on BOSSES as a melee DPS and getting oneshot, because they need to be TANKED.....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We've literally already got confirmation of more content in the first 4 months of Legion than the entire first year of WoD. I mean, sure be skeptical of what comes after if you like, but facts are facts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That wasn't the point of that answer. He was talking about adding new dungeons WITHOUT making the older ones utterly pointless. As was the case with ZA/ZG and End Time dungeons in Cata. With Mythic+ dungeons can be kept relevant for the entirety of the expansion, and you can add dungeons without making them the exclusive 5 man content for that Tier.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He addressed this in another answer. They had a choice, they decided affecting the 10m groups more would cause less of an issue than shifting the weight of changing to 25m groups down to 15. In essence, the assumption was that increasing your team size or merging to 20m was baseline easier to accomplish than 15 people having to suddenly form a new team or hope to get picked elsewhere.<br />
<br />
You're also quoting an answer about the general success of the various difficulties, but only talking about Mythic raid size.<br />
<br />
-- I think you missed the point. The way Blizzard pushes things is not &quot;is it fun&quot; but more of a &quot;our pride is invested and if you don't like it we will punish you to force it&quot;. It's disappointing you were unable to see this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Any casual&quot; -- can you please be more specific? Do you mean ANYONE in quest gear can do this? You go on to say &quot;just because you can't hop in in greens&quot; but come one, you don't elaborate what casual means and THEN go to say &quot;well, you can't walk in with greens&quot;. -- you can try and be more vague on purpose? or accident?<br />
<br />
I think you never played WotLK. In WotLK you had a currency that you could fall back in in case RNG fucked you or you forgot to sacrifice babies to the Blizzard developers for their good grace. In which case you were given a choice, something you haven't seen since wrath and something you wouldn't be aware of since you never played wrath, between upgradeable tier gear and a slightly higher level but non-upgradable non-tier gear. This was with varying currency. This currency meant that if RNG fucked you or your raid leader fucked you -- you could still get something eventually. I know this is contrary to anything you've seen since you've never played Wrath.<br />
<br />
When I was talking about classes being preferred you likely didn't understand as you haven't played pre-cata expansions. There was a point in time where a certain class or spec was NEEDED. This meant that you NEEDED a hunter. A VERY geared warlock or mage would be passed over. Those were not fun days. I know the &quot;vanilla&quot; folks use rose colored glasses but trust me, those were VERY annoying an VERY frustrating days.<br />
<br />
As far as invasion bosses the primary problem is heals. Not the lack of healers but the lack of raid frames. Again, you wouldn't understand so I'll help. A healer can't heal the enemy faction. &quot;Nameplates&quot; are things above peoples head that allow you to click on them. They don't show enemy versus friendly. This means that healers have a difficult time know who to heal. If you target an enemy then you end up targeting yourself. As such you can't heal the enemy faction tanking the boss. If it's a friendly person tanking the boss you have to wait, look, and then heal. That's a pretty narrow time frame. In addition you can't see anyone around you because you're not in a raid. Of course you're not a healer so I don't expect you to understand this so I'll just leave it at that. Roll a healer. Then come back in a few days. <br />
<br />
We've been having &quot;confirmation&quot; since Cata. Feed me another line of bullshit. I know YOU drink the kool-aide but the rest of us don't. There are no &quot;facts&quot; until it's released. There are claims. Please learn the difference. We've been lied to many times. In fact since ICC/RS. Since you're a Cata person or beyond, this means &quot;for quite some time&quot;.<br />
<br />
Do you feel that running Stockades runs is pointless? Why? I mean, shouldn't you get real gear from that? No? Then why do you feel you &quot;deserve&quot; modern gear from current expansion dungeons? This is why Dragon Soul catch up worked so well but again, I don't think you played those expansions so I'm not sure you understand.<br />
<br />
I only talked about Mythic because it's the easiest thing to measure. You certainly can't deny the amount of 10/25 heroic guilds it destroyed. This cost them something not insignificant. Those that died we were forced to run what's called &quot;heroic&quot; runs. Something under what they were used to while Mythic was slightly above what they were used to. Old-school Heroic groups were piss in the wind and told to man up, go easier, or quit. A not so insignificant amount quit. You are wanting to divert the conversation so you can buff up Blizzards ego. I am wanting to talk about realities here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stated exactly what was required, 820-825 gear minimum, which is what you get from Heroic dungeons and World Quests. Did you actually play Alpha/Beta? Because getting into Mythic dungeons is no challenge whatsoever, it's what naturally happens as you play the game, even at an ultra-casual level of just doing a few World Quests/dungeons every now and then.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you never played WotLK. In WotLK you had a currency that you could fall back in in case RNG fucked you or you forgot to sacrifice babies to the Blizzard developers for their good grace.

<br />
I think you assume way too much =) I've played and raided for 12 years straight pretty much. Currency systems were and are a band-aid and a cancer to the game in many ways. I'm quite loathe to remember times when you had to grind your x Heroics asap for the ID so you could go do your mandatory upgrades. <br />
<br />
RNG will simply never &quot;fuck you&quot; in a way that you feel like you got nothing. That hasn't been the case in...well, quite a long time. Do you even play nowadays? You are talking about systems that were in place way before things such as: personal loot, bonus rolls, warforged rolls, etc. Put your assertions into context, and maybe you'll have a point in there somewhere. At the end of the day, there is no way you will get &quot;fucked&quot; by RNG or &quot;your raidleader&quot; (you seem to have made some bad experiences...or feel very entitled to drops in a raid group) in this day and age.<br />
<br />
<br />

I directly referred to this. You seem to not have read anything that you are replying to. He clearly stated that they do not wish to return to this ever again - and having said that, many assumptions of &quot;we need X&quot; TODAY are mostly based on community perception, not actual ingame necessity. I don't know why you keep asserting that &quot;you never played X&quot;, when you don't even bother to comprehend what you're replying to first.<br />

<br />
I actually just healed Mythic Mannoroth and Archimonde in my offspec last night =) fun as hell. I don't think you realize that Invasions are not intended to be super-organized content that you need to raid-heal everyone involved in. Did you maybe forget that you can still form a group or raid and get healed if you so wish? That being said you seem to struggle with this throwaway content quite a bit. It must be a harsh challenge to tag outdoor bosses and get loot for free. Maybe you remember something called the AQ opening event? Or the Naxxramas Scourge invasions? Maybe the demonic invasions pre-TBC? They were all like that =) If you charge in without a group somewhere, you will likely get stomped on. <br />
<br />
<br />

Obviously you're not very versed in how to speak like an adult. &quot;Lying&quot; means intent of misleading someone. I think you'd have a very hard time proving that under any circumstance present here. But ofc, you're not actually making any arguments, but simply flinging emotionally charged statements and having a hissy fit. Whether you like it or not we already know the content we are getting in the first 6 months of Legion. You can of course assume that it's all &quot;lies&quot; and 7.1 and Nighthold are all not coming out until Summer 2017, but that's not very constructive now, is it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
You're rambling and making no sense whatsoever. The point being made was that with Mythic+, the 7.0 release dungeons can be kept relevant throughout the expansion, the higher your gear gets the better you can run higher difficulties and still get relevant rewards that complement new raids. New dungeons in turn don't completely replace those first dungeons due to rewarding baseline higher gear, but simply add to the existing palette. Something I think we can all agree is very desirable. I don't know about you, but I tired of running End Time dungeons/ZA/ZG exclusively extremely quickly. What you're getting with Mythic+ is more of a system harking back to TBC when heroics were relevant for almost all of the expansion. <br />
<br />
<br />
I only talked about Mythic because it's the easiest thing to measure. You certainly can't deny the amount of 10/25 heroic guilds it destroyed. This cost them something not insignificant.

<br />
You quite clearly don't want to talk about &quot;realities&quot; or facts, as I mentioned and Hazzikostas very plainly explained they are quite aware of what it caused, but they believed that shifting the weight of having to change to 10m was better overall than having the 25m guilds fall apart. At the end of the day the change was excellent for high progress raiding, unless you were a die-hard 10m raider then I can understand that you feel a bit bitter about it, but nontheless in terms of streamlining the highest difficulty it has worked very, very well. They knew it would cost something in the short term, and it is paying off big time in the long term. Consider that this is the first expansion ever that has not seen any major changes to raid size/design. This is the first time guild situations will remain stable and predictable from one iteration of the game to the next. That is thanks to that change working out.</div></div><hr />

You clearly aren't paying attention and want to start your own discussion but are interjecting non-sense in to places that's unrelated.<br />
<br />
I was talking about healing invasions and how it sucks. I'm not sure why you brought up Manno heals because that's in a &quot;raid&quot; setting where you are with 10+ people and usually have something called &quot;raid frames&quot;. Raids are usually instanced and in instances you're already grouped up with people. I was complaining about the problem with healing invasions which are not raids. I'm well aware what their intent is and I listed a valid complaint.<br />
<br />
I would sincerely be surprised if you've played before MoP.<br />
<br />
RNG fucked me for two tiers in WoD -- so I'd be surprised if you raided any real amount in WoD either.<br />
<br />
You seem to continue doing the same thing with each response to every critique. Bringing in something else that's unrelated and then wanting to respond. At this point I think you're not reading what I'm saying and comprehending it appropriately.<br />
<br />
You see, when someone critiques something -- that's just that. Whether the person they are critiquing has acknowledged it or not isn't relevant. This is a critical aspect I think you're failing to grasp. Once you learn this aspect we can continue our conversation from scratch so as to help you get a better understanding.</div></div><hr />

No one wants to do pugs either, they rarely go well so if you want a clean, successful mythic dungeon done you will now have to join guilds etc. It just seems unnecessary and I'm hoping it doesn't backfire too hard for blizzard. From what I've seen, no one wants Mythic only dungeons.<br />

This may not be the problem for one person if you take 5 spots and compare classes like this in optimal setup you may get like 1 extra person doing damage...which is alot and I would say this hits &quot;its the only viable option&quot; mark.</div></div><hr />
