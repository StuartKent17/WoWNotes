NOT (pre-)4.0!<br />
Minor content patch that was already anounced.<br />
<br />
Also, I remember there were some PTR forum cleanups without a actualy PTR in near future..They just cleaned it up.<br />
<br />
Also frost lotus drop rate ftw! At least on my server the cost more than the flasks themself. Just fair - they did it with arctic fur and I always wondered why it didn't happen to frost lotus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the drop rate seems to be around 5%, so its 7.5%. Not much but BETTER!<br />
In other words:<br />
<br />
<br />
So? it still means 50 % more frost lotuses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While this is going to cut in to my pockets, it will be better overall for raiders in my guild as some of them have to spend so much gold just to keep flasked. Kinda glad I get the 2hr flask benefit from Alchemy. =D</div></div><hr />

i'm extremely lazy but i got a few stack of lotus while farming herb for deck. i'm probably set for a few months. our realm have more of a problem with the lack of lichbloom as no one farm them. 40gold a stack of lichbloom when other are like 13gold.</div></div><hr />

Yesterday, someone wanted to sell frost lotuses by the stack for &quot;only&quot; 1700 gold. I told them I'd wait until the end of the week for the prices to go down. I'm very glad I waited.

smelt titansteel has a 20hr cooldown, transmute titanium (8 sarronite bars to 1 titanium bar) does not. I transmute all my sarronite to titanium and prospect my titanium ore, i could probably make more money selling the titanium ore but buying epic gems just feels dirty.<br />

No that would be an increase by 50 percantage units which the post did not say.<br />

Thank you. Best to get this obligatory post out of the way so some people don't think they're going to see 10g Frost Lotuses any time soon. <br />
<br />
The real reason frost lotus is that Herbalism is still the only profession in the game that gives no raiding advantage whatsoever. Many don't get it on alts anymore. If herbalism give some sort of dps advantage in raids, more would stay herbalism and you'd see far more nodes farmed by people doing dailies. <br />
<br />
The lack of people flying to instances has also hurt the market a bit. Alll you have left now for constant lotus supply are people who still have an alt with herbalism that they can do farm runs on once in a while.</div></div><hr />

Nobody wants to farm anymore, they all just want to &quot;buy it&quot;.<br />

You mean, they wouldn't be so high if Blizzard hadn't been trying their best to increase the raiding population, without a corresponding increase in the supply of mandatory raiding materials.</div></div><hr />

Of course, it's not like I farm that much anyways, weekend-only playtimes suck. And since I stopped farming heroics for triumphs for my 232, most of which is replaced by now, I rarely fly around Icecrown herbing while in the LFG queue.<br />
<br />
I really hope they balance the profession bonuses... while lifeblood is a good oh shit button, for reducing grind downtime or for soloing elites in conjunction with enraged regeneration, it just doesn't cut it. 15% of your HP &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; extra sockets or 1337 gems.</div></div><hr />

You want top deeps? Spend the cash. Flask of Endless Rage/Frost Wyrm/Stone Blood ARE NOT the only flasks available in the game. There are plenty of other flasks/elixirs that offer satisfactory buffs for a fraction of the cost. The problem is players' lust for an extra 20 sp here, and extra 40 ap there.<br />
<br />
The Frost Lotus flasks aren't a right, they are a priviledge. Don't like the price? Don't buy them. Or guy level Herbz/Alchemy and get your own. Your JC/Enchanting/Tailoring/Engineering/Blacksmithing owns my Herbz/Alchemy in raiding throughput. We all make sacrifices, you can't have your cake and eat it too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It happens. I think Blizz's original plans for WotLK was not to have all 25 raiders in 10 guilds using 4+ flasks per night 3 days a week, every week. Like I said, Lotus flasks are a priviledge, not a right. If you farm and get nothing, looks like only the priviledged are getting the secksy flasks that week (in this case you, and whoever spends the cash).<br />

<br />
Increased by 50% and increased to 50% are vastly different.<br />
<br />
Even as a herbalist and alchemist, I'm very happy for this change. Farming up enough herbs to cook up 50 flasks but only finding enough lotuses for 4 is a bit silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a big deal. Why? Well frost lotus is going for an average of 80g EACH on my server. By increasing the drop rate that means the supply will be 1.5x what it was. Demand should remain about the same which &quot;should&quot; lower the price down to about 55g each all other variables held constant.<br />
<br />
Also there is the panic effect that takes place when changes are made. Prices have already crashed to 65g on server and the change hasn't been up long enough to really change supply. There's a perception that the market will be flooded so hoarders are dropping their stashes early.</div></div><hr />

Now add 5% + 2.5% and you get? 7.5% WOW that was extremely hard to understand lol....<br />
<br />
2. It isn't hard to lvl an Alch/Herb, people should take one of there many Alt's and change it to that. Unless all your Alt's are being used for raiding &lt;which isn't very likely&gt;... It really isn't that hard to lvl it. I have a 80 Druid Tauren that is maxed Alch/herb, I NEVER play him, unless i am gathering and making pots... Other then that, I am on my Shaman which is Tailoring/Inscriptionist. <br />

Actually, Blizzard did account for every single player in the instance having the best possible flask. They balanced the encounter around it.<br />
<br />
They always did balance the encounters for optimal buffs. It used to be so silly that they had to exclude flasks from stacking with potions and countless other buffs from adding anything of value.<br />
<br />
This increase in Frost Lotus availability is a good thing, and it reflects well on Blizzard to adjust to this situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ok so you are an alchemist and you spent 2 hours farming and get 10 Frost Lotus. I am no Rocket Scientist but with your mixology buff<br />
<br />
10 Frost Lotus <br />
x 2 Flasks per Lotus (not counting procs)<br />
20 Flasks<br />
x 2 Hours per flask (Mixology buff)<br />
40 Hours of flasks in 2 hours of farming<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the average raider raids 3-4 times a week for 3-4 hours a raid. If my math is correct the average raider raids 9-16 hours a week meaning if your drop rate stayed the same and you were on the top end of the average, you could farm 1 hour a week or about 9 minutes a day and have enough flasks for your own supply. Anything over that amount is profit.<br />
<br />
NOW with the buff you will be getting about 15 in 2 hours meaning you will only need<br />
to farm about 1 hour 20 minutes to get your standard 10 Frost lotus. So now in order to facilitate your 16 hour raid week you will only need to farm 40 minutes a week or 6 minutes a day.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure a lot of people in low end guilds stopped using flasks when they started costing so much. More lotuses mean more supply. More supply (in the short run) means lower prices. Lower prices mean more people have access to them.<br />
<br />
Now, with these people starting to use flasks again (thus increased demand) the price will rise again. The equilibrium will settle right around where it was before in the long run because the demand will rise proportionately with the supply.</div></div><hr />

One costs 30 g on my server, I bought like hundred which cost me 3000 gold. I use like 4 in an ICC raid, depending on how good the group is and how long we raid. Usually it's like 3-4 hours so let's say 4 flasks + 1 for AK. So it's 10 per week when I'm doing 10 and 25 man. That's 300 gold per week. That's not much. So my 100 bought flasks will probably last at least for 10 weeks... and I'm only using them right before the boss, if I don't have one while we're doing trash I don't reflask, so 4 flasks per raid is really the maximum it'll probably be less. For AK it's not even neccessary to use a flask. I bet you can raid for months and only have to pay a few 1000 gold for flasks, and you don't even have to farm much for that amount of gold, use your professions and you will have enough gold.</div></div><hr />

... We are talking about HERBALISM, not alchemy. Skinning is the only gathering profession with a half decent bonus(crit), mining gives you stam (sucks) and herb gives you a 3 min CD oh shit 15% HP HOT.<br />

So if I can afford flask replacements etc right now, I doubt there are really people out there who are bad enough to not flask at all for even 10 man ICC because &quot;it's too expensive waah&quot;.</div></div><hr />

On the flip side, someone was asking to buy a stack of Endless Rage. I message them saying I can make if they get the mats. They offer 400g for a stack if I use my own mats.

People who were willing to pay the price for it read that and dropped their offers significantly until finally they realized &quot;Hey, the drop rate wasn't actually increased by that much&quot; and began paying the high prices again. Even today, I saw people on my server in trade chat saying. &quot;OMG GAIS, DNT BUY FLASKS OR LOTUS 2DAY CUZ THEY JUST MADE THE DROPRATE 50%%%%!!!!!!&quot; Even I think the price of Frost Lotus was far too high, but if the drop rate was only increased by 50% of what it currently was, they should still remain reasonably expensive. Honestly, I have never seen an issue with giving money to the people who dedicate time out of their day to farm materials for the server. As someone before had said, soon they're going to have material vendors in every major city at this rate. ._.<br />

<br />
I'm sure a lot of people in low end guilds stopped using flasks when they started costing so much. More lotuses mean more supply. More supply (in the short run) means lower prices. Lower prices mean more people have access to them.<br />
<br />
Now, with these people starting to use flasks again (thus increased demand) the price will rise again. The equilibrium will settle right around where it was before in the long run because the demand will rise proportionately with the supply.<br />
<br />
<br />
You could be right but you are making 2 assumptions. 1. That guilds have stopped buying flasks in a large enough quantity to matter and 2. That they will start buying flasks if they ever stopped. Some people dont buy flasks ever so i doubt this will be the case. Keep in mind 50g is easy to make. So this really doesnt follow normal economics.<br />
<br />
If you cannot make 100g a day on average you are doing something wrong and should never raid and therby never need a flask.</div></div><hr />

I can enchant my entire gear with matts bought from the AH and pay less then I do to buy flasks for 1 night of raiding.<br />

I as a enchanter don't even disenchant anymore since that patch. I have enough matts to fully enchant 15-20 people. So I just vendor every single items that I get to be able to pay for the flasks when raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah but with people flasking for raiding 3-4 times a week for icc in raiding guilds there is a huge demand compared to toc tier.<br />
<br />
25 raidersx3 hours= 75 flasks=37 frost lotus which at the current droprate is 740 nodes if farming outside wg.<br />
<br />
Side note would have been nice to have impure saronite nodes/freyas cache in icc like ulduar had. Freyas room helped keep flask prices down single handedly.</div></div><hr />

Yep, looks like this will be the same story. Lotuses will cost less than a stack of Goldclovers. Why won't they do this with titanium ore spawns? And the powder drop rate from prospecting? The demand for titanium is far greater than for flowers, would really make life a little bit easier.<br />
And don't get me started on the powder and JC tokens, last time I checked you need 509 tokens to buy all WotLK designs; unless you farm/buy ridiculous amounts of titanium/powder, it takes over a year to get them all.<br />

They are already doing that, you get instantly ported from your city to your heroic daily, need on the frozen orb as everyone else greeds on it, then use the frozen orb to buy frost lotus. Tailors no longer have to leave their city to make their specialty cloth either, 5 min flights to dragonblight was to far.</div></div><hr />
