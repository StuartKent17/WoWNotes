The Patch 7.2 PTR is on the way! Patch 7.2 has several major features:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Tomb of Sargeras raid, with Kil'jaeden as the final boss<br />
Legion Assault world events<br />
Flying and Class Mounts from the continued Order Hall Campaign<br />
New Dungeon - Cathedral of Eternal Night<br />
PvP Brawls<br />
New Artifact Traits and models<br />
New Factions, World Quests, and more!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2 - Tomb of Sargeras<br />
<br />
Return to The Tomb of Sargeras, this time it might end differently. <br />
Continues the Order Hall Campaign. <br />
New Faction. <br />
New World Quests, including class world quests. <br />
Making our way to the tomb requires claiming a foothold and fortifying it. Build a base and plan the assault similar to Isle of Quel'danas. Players will be able to choose which buildings to build, allowing them to earn different rewards and change the story. Unlock world quests, rewards, vendors, world bosses. Not a linear progression this time. <br />
Legion Assaults - Inspired by pre-expansion event. Defend against Legion invasions in the Broken Isles. <br />
When a zone is under attack, world quests in that zone are disabled, the skybox turns dark, and the Legion appears in the skies. You will complete a variety of world quests to clear the Legion out of the zone. These count towards your Emissary quests. Once you clear out enough of the Legion forces, you can go after the commander. <br />
Once you finish the assault on the ground, you can join a three player scenario (role-agnostic) taking the fight to the Legion ships in the skies. <br />
Different invasion content for each zone. <br />
Flying returns! - The second part of the Pathfinder achievement is added, no raid or dungeon content required, just outdoor world gameplay. <br />
Flying will be unlocked account-wide!<br />
Each class will have their own epic class mount in the patch. These are rewarded by your Class Order campaign. <br />
After the Nighthold comes the Tomb of Sargeras. Nine boss raid.<br />
<br />
The Tomb of Sargeras was the Temple of Elune. Venture into underground caverns where allies of Queen Azshara await us. <br />
Another part of the Tomb has been sealed since the time of the Sundering. <br />
Infernal / Pit Lord type boss will come through a wall and block your path at the start of the raid. <br />
A melee variant of the Jailer is the second boss.<br />
Naga Brute and Sea Witch are up next. <br />
Fallen Avatar of Sargeras is another boss. <br />
Kil'jaeden himself awaits us as the final boss. <br />
<br />
New Dungeon - Cathedral of Eternal Night, 4 boss dungeon, normal, heroic, and mythic+ difficulty, use the Aegis of Aggramar to open the way. <br />
PvP Brawls<br />
<br />
Inspired by brawls in other Blizzard games. A week long event that varies gameplay and lets you experience PvP in a new way. <br />
Brawls will be fun and allow the team to experiment with different modes of PvP gameplay. If they are well received they could be added into the regular game. <br />
Southshore vs Tarren Mill, Warsong Gulch (cap the flag without requiring your own flag), Packed House (15v15 arena), Winter Arathi Basin (Low visibility due to weather, water frozen), Eye of the Horn (Eye of the Storm with everyone on Ram mounts)<br />
<br />
Further empower your Artifact, new traits, including a gold border one, three points with utility. Also allows you to put another point into all of your three point traits. 15 new points to be added. More Artifact Knowledge coming. <br />
New types of Relics are coming, modifying two traits! <br />
Patch 7.2 continues your Artifact Quest Line, allowing you to unlock the previously mentioned new traits. <br />
You will also be able to unlock another Artifact Appearance. This one will recognize solo player skill, mastery of your spec. Inspirited by Anathema and Benediction or the Warlock Green Fire quest. <br />
Guardian druids get a werewolf-bear style skin! <br />
Warriors are finally getting their flail weapon appearance. <br />
Patch 7.2 will retune Heroic and Mythic+ dungeons, both difficulty and rewards. <br />
Karazhan will be broken into Upper and Lower sections, queueable random heroics, Mythic+ as well. <br />
Court of Stars and The Arcway will also become queueable.<br />
New Keystone affixes are coming. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New Class Mounts<br />
<br />
<br />

Official Patch 7.2 BlizzCon Recap<br />
Delivering New Content<br />
One of the key goals for Legion is to make sure we’re delivering a steady stream of content throughout the expansion. We want to make sure there’s always something to look forward to. We also want to take better advantage of the very nature of MMOs by providing a living, breathing world, with things changing day-to-day or week-to-week, and offering a wide variety of content and new rewards.<br />
<br />
To accomplish this, we’re building our patch structure in Legion to deliver content updates of varying sizes. You’ll see everything from a small patch like 6.2.3, which added Cataclysm Timewalking and other features, to larger update like Patch 6.2: Fury of Hellfire, or something in-between like Patch 7.1: Return to Karazhan—there’s no one size fits all approach.<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2: The Tomb of Sargeras<br />
If patch 7.1.5 is a small patch, what exactly is a “big” patch? In this case, it’s Patch 7.2: The Tomb of Sargeras. This patch introduces larger pieces of content which include a new raid, the continuation of the Class Order Campaign, and much more.<br />
Return to the Broken Shore<br />
<br />
The demonic forces of the Burning Legion have built massive structures on the Broken Shore as a base of operations for their assault on Azeroth. It’s here that the Horde and the Alliance experienced a series of tragedies at the hands of the Legion. Now that they’ve regrouped, acquired their new weapons of power, and recruited new allies, it’s time to make a triumphant return.<br />
<br />
Where factions failed, the Class Orders will succeed. Each class will continue their Class Order Campaign on the Broken Shore, and a new faction will be introduced: the Armies of Legionfall. Players will take part in helping build the Legionfall base to establish the initial foothold on the island, then work their way through the Legion’s defenses and eventually reach the stronghold.<br />
<br />
To do this, the Class Orders will need to work together build up their forces by fortifying ancient elven buildings and upgrading them into one of three buildings—Nether Disruptor, Command Center, or Mage Tower—which will provide additional benefits.<br />
<br />
Players will also discover new World Quests on the Broken Shore—along with other new challenges.<br />
<br />
Legion Assaults<br />
Remember the Legion invasions across Azeroth prior to the expansion’s launch? As the fight against the Legion intensifies, new assaults will be unleashed within the various zones of the Broken Isles, and heroes will be implored to thwart them once again. As the assaults intensify, the battle will culminate in a new three-player scenario that takes the fight to the Legion ships above.<br />
<br />
Flying!<br />
If you haven’t been working your way through Broken Isles Pathfinder Part One, make sure you’re well on your way before the introduction of Part Two. Once players have earned this achievement, they’ll be rewarded with Broken Isles Flying account-wide.<br />
<br />
What’s even better than flying over the Broken Isles? Flying over them on your own new epic class mount! By completing the Broken Shore campaign and maxing out your Legionfall reputation, you’ll be rewarded a mount that’s unique to your class as a symbol of your dedication to defeating the Legion.<br />
<br />
New Raid Zone: Tomb of Sargeras<br />
On the opposite end of the Broken Shore, the Tomb of Sargeras lies in wait. Formerly the Temple of Elune, this raid dungeon will contain nine new bosses to conquer. After gaining the fifth Pillar of Creation—the Eye of Aman’Thul—from within the Nighthold, you’ll descend into the depths of the tomb and use the pillars to seal the portal through which the Legion entered Azeroth.<br />
<br />
New Dungeon: Cathedral of Eternal Night<br />
It’s been some time since we’ve added a new dungeon in a patch, so we thought it was about time. Patch 7.2 also features a new four-boss dungeon: Cathedral of Eternal Night. While the raid descends into the tomb, the dungeon ascends into the upper reaches of the spire. You’ll use the Aegis of Aggramar to open the rest of the tomb.<br />
<br />
PvP Brawls<br />
Inspired by other Blizzard games’ Brawl modes, Battleground Brawls will alter the typical rulesets in Battlegrounds. A new Brawl will be available weekly, which will add variety to the gameplay and give players some fun new activities to check out. Here are a few examples:<br />
<br />
<br />
Southshore vs. Tarren Mill – Dive into this classic large-scale game of team deathmatch.<br />
Instant-Cap Warsong Gulch – You don’t need to protect your own flag. Just grab and go!<br />
Packed House: 15 v 15 Arena – Who needs elbow room?<br />
Gravity Lapse – Defy the law of gravity in this brawl.<br />
Winter Arathi Basin – Low visibility and iced over waterways await you.<br />
Eye of the Horn – Mounted ram fights are the new PvP. <br />
<br />
<br />
Artifact Updates<br />
Artifact weapons are one of the major features of the expansion, with many players increasing their Artifact Knowledge, unlocking new traits, and customizing the looks of their weapons to suit their characters. As a part of Patch 7.2, we’re making a few new system updates to go along with all that.<br />
<br />
The first of these updates is the addition of new Artifact traits that can be earned and unlocked via a new Artifact campaign, which you can embark on once you’ve maxed out your Artifact weapon. There will be at least three new traits per weapon, and you can unlock the ability to spend a fourth point on every existing minor trait on your weapon. There will be approximately 15 new traits for players to earn and spend to upgrade and customize their character.<br />
<br />
There will also be new Artifact Knowledge levels to make sure there are adequate catch-up mechanics for those who switch between characters, have alts, or are just coming into the expansion a bit late.<br />
<br />
For additional variety and customization, we’re adding new relics that modify two Artifact traits instead of just one, so that players can further guide the direction they want their character to progress.<br />
<br />
Beyond unlocking new traits, the new Artifact campaign will provide an opportunity for players to show mastery of their class with a solo skill challenge, which will unlock a new appearance for their chosen spec weapon. These appearances have been inspired by previous class questlines that led to weapons like Anathema/Benediction, and Rhok’delar. No grouping required—or allowed—and completing the challenge will reward a truly distinctive appearance.<br />
<br />
Dungeon Updates<br />
Even as we’re adding new dungeons, we’re also working to keep dungeons relevant through the entirety of the expansion.<br />
<br />
Karazhan offers an opportunity for Mythic Keystones, but at nine bosses, it’s a bit large to fit within the Keystone structure. To address this, we’re splitting the dungeon into Upper and Lower Karazhan. There will be two separate four-boss sections that will fit into the system alongside existing dungeons and the new Cathedral of Eternal Night dungeon. This will bring the total of Mythic Keystone dungeons to 12.<br />
<br />
To make sure all Mythic Keystone dungeons are kept relevant, we’ll also bump up the baseline difficulty, along with increasing the item rewards. To go along with this, we’ll also be experimenting with some new affixes on Keystones.<br />
<br />
Players will get to see Patch 7.2: The Tomb of Sargeras on the PTR some time after the launch of Patch 7.1.5.</div></div><hr />

Nothing says the release of 7.2 has to coincide with the raid opening, a new dungeon/solo content to run in 2-3 months would be a welcome change after 2-3 months of the same raid.</div></div><hr />

Tomb is not connected to 7.2 release, probably will come with 7.2.5. Look at it like with 7.1 (intruduced questline leading to Nighthold) and 7.1.5 (balance patch and Nighthold release). I expect new raid to launch late June.</div></div><hr />

This. Tbh and not to go on about another game here I think when it comes to pacing they looked at how FF14 does it with the 3 and a half month content patches and small patch inbetween.<br />
<br />
Honestly while Legion isn't my cup of tea personally it's still a good expansion and I have to commend them for this pacing with content. They seem to be on the track of what they said years ago.</div></div><hr />

Did I say that? I think it's good content is coming out faster. And did I say there would be a new expansion announced or released this year? No. It's about time Blizzard got off their backsides and did decent pacing with content and now they are people are whinging about it.<br />

Because a lot of the playerbase were asking for them to release content quicker and stop with droughts. This is their answer. I imagine to avoid droughts with the final tier they will do mini and medium sized patches upto the expansion. Which is fine.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't have to be. If that is released a year before the expansion for example then expect a lot of filler content and possibly a filler raid. I'm expecting Argus to be a zone or two to be honest.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, it has been explicitly made clear that the Tomb of Sargeras raid will not open until after 7.2 release.<br />
<br />
&quot;Making our way to the tomb requires claiming a foothold and fortifying it. Build a base and plan the assault similar to Isle of Quel'danas.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I am willing to count Kara as 2 dungeons. There are enough bosses.<br />
<br />
So we have 13 dungeons once 7.2 comes out.<br />
<br />
Black Rook Hold<br />
Court of Stars<br />
Darkheart Thicket<br />
Eye of Azshara<br />
Halls of Valor<br />
Maw of Souls<br />
Neltharion's Lair<br />
The Arcway<br />

Violet Hold<br />
Kara wing 1<br />
Kara wing 2<br />
Cathedral of endless Night.<br />

I have to hand it to Blizz. They really are delivering. We probably wont see this live until the spring/early summer but it's alright because we JUST got a new raid to deal with. So much content. Solo and world content, dungeons with all difficulty, raids, progressive story content. *drools* Shut up Blizz and TAKE MY MONEY!<br />
<br />
They said they would release the patch weeks or months before the Tomb of Sargeras comes out. Ptrs usually last 1-2 months. This will probably come out at the end of March. Tomb launching end of May. That gives 4.5 months of Nighthold. 7.2.5 launching in late June. 7.3 ptr going up late July. 7.3 coming out early October with the raid coming out late November.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
I feel like we will then have a filler patch or two before a summer release of 8.0. <br />
<br />
Argus raid lasting 9 months with a 4 or 5 boss filler raid sometime in early Spring.</div></div><hr />

7.1.5 only has the brawlers guild as content. And NH is raiding content. 7.2 wont hold any raiding content for a while (ToS will probably release in 7.2.5).<br />
<br />
I think this way of delivering content is perfect: first they deliver all outdoor, solo and 5-man content while the current raid (NH) is just on farm or in late progress for most guilds and then a couple months later the big raid, when raiders have completed all the other patch content and can focus on progressing on the new raid.<br />
<br />
And they are probably making Nighthold mythic very hard, so if 7.2 drops halfway the Nighthold tier, it will serve as a nerf to the instance making it doable for people who didnt farm 54 traits and arent super skilled or raiding 3 or more nights a week.<br />
(7.2 will bring new AK lvls (up from 25) and new traits so people will get more powerful, also all the dungeon rewards will be scaled up and probably wq rewars too)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also: non-raiders dont have to wait 6/8 months for new content.</div></div><hr />

I gave that a try when I started playing GW2 but well got to about level 30 I think before I stopped playing mind you it was a F2P account.. I do admire those who can play multiple MMO's as I don't think I could do it now.. :)</div></div><hr />

I doubt it will be if they want it to be more outdoor content focused. And I don't think it should be either. Also they want everyone to get their class mount I doubt much difficulty will be involved. Again I see no issue with it.</div></div><hr />

I hope that sargeras IS the final boss, but we just bring em to 80% until we get rofl-stomped by em. But then, we absorb the relics of the pantheon, we absorb the Nightwells energy, the army of lights energy, the elemental's energy, the chi's energy, and azeroth's energy herself, while absorbing elune's might, to destroy sargeras....<br />

<br />
I don't think we actually need to absorb that much, Brox managed to harm Sargeras with a simple axe made by Cenarius. I beat Cenarius' ass in the last raid we were all in.<br />
<br />
Our Artifacts are way more powerful than the simple axe Cenarius made.<br />
<br />
<br />
We will probably just sacrifice our Artifacts to kill Sargeras.</div></div><hr />

Given blizzards shitty story telling that is probably how it ends.<br />
<br />
Alternatively Illidan grabs the big d of Sargeras and becomes Lord of thte Burning legion and just tells khadgAR TO tell the world that Sargeras died and Illidan stormrage died with him.</div></div><hr />

Not Garrisons at all, you just contribute resources to get a zone wide buff/ability. You don't have a mission table or profession buildings there or anything. Totally different.<br />
<br />
It's a bit like the WoD zone buildings like where you built an arena or lumber mill in Gorgrond and got something from it but now you don't just get them instantly you contribute to them and you can get all of them.</div></div><hr />

Do you mean making the class mount unlock a requirement for flying on other mounts.<br />
Or do you mean give it as part of the flying unlock, in which case it would be contradictory to your other requests.<br />
<br />
You say you want the class mount to be part of flying, which by the nature of that unlock is lacking anything class specific and therefore how can it have a difficulty related to any previous class specific content.<br />
<br />
Nice QoL changes, particularly for transmog.<br />

<br />
Tomb will most likely be connected to 7.2 release, they said at Blizzcon with the patch will come the raid.

<br />
They literally said in one Q&amp;A that they want to avoid 6.2 situation (when we were starving for world content, but Hellfire Citadel could easily be delayed month or two), and 7.2 will have questline leading to Tomb. Stop spreading misinformation.<br />
<br />
I think it is logic that we will have minor 7.2.5 - to prepare classes for next raid tier and give us some small &quot;evergreen&quot; content (like timewalking raids).</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of the systems they brought are decent. Just the RNG and Legendaries was crap. Transmog update was brilliant in terms of QoL, World Quests were fine and Mythic + is what people were asking for. Alternate advancement outside of raiding.<br />
<br />
I'm all for them using systems from other games or their own. But some they brought in from Diablo were pretty crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm fine with the Diablo-like stuff except for the legendary system. It's really the only thing holding A LOT of people back. I mean, some classes rely on specific legendaries to even be worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

Or do you mean give it as part of the flying unlock, in which case it would be contradictory to your other requests.<br />
<br />
You say you want the class mount to be part of flying, which by the nature of that unlock is lacking anything class specific and therefore how can it have a difficulty related to any previous class specific content.<br />
<br />
Nice QoL changes, particularly for transmog.<br />
And finally something to do at exalted for reputations.<br />
Time will tell as to exactly what that is though.<br />
<br />
i meant make the class mount questline part of the whole pathfinder 2 achievement.<br />
And then the actual class mount chains hard instead of easy as hell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard have made it clear that the second part of pathfinder will be from outdoor content.<br />
It is already as hard as it is going to get for that.<br />
<br />
I don't see why the travel option ought to be &quot;hard&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for there being class specific content for the mounts, I would actually tend to agree.<br />
The difficulty is a rather more subjective opinion though, not least because we can't attribute a number to it.<br />
An identical encounter would absolutely be easier with some than others, but there won't even be a consistent difficulty even if it was tailored for every spec.</div></div><hr />
