<br />
On the side note Blizzard has apparently been secretive about this one, and even after the release/reveal of information regarding the expansion they still keep most of stuff in the dark, for a reason. Just because this expansion is titled 'Battle for Azeroth', it doesn't mean that Alliance and Horde will munch on each other the entire time. I believe the actual reason behind this war are the old gods using their pawns to create struggles and opportunity to weaken the mighty force that, united, managed to halt the Legion invasion and in the end doom them.<br />
<br />
If we recall back to what hints and whispers were pointed towards us, from both Varimathras and that creature in the Emerald Nightmare, we have traitors and servants of the void among our ranks. I have said it numerous times by now since the reveal, and I'll do so again - this is but a proper and perfectly planned groundwork for what's to come. Great expansion and story-telling is ahead of us, though this time Blizzard is really secretive about their approach and for a reason - Void Lords and Old Gods work from the shadows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's kind of the point of these new &quot;sub&quot; races. They aren't brand new races just off sets of races already in game. So they will look basically the same as the &quot;main&quot; race they came from except with very slight differences. Like the light forged Draenei can have light tattoos and a rune on their forehead.</div></div><hr />

why don't you settle down and wait till you see the story that justifies them, aye? I mean, why would ALL of the Nightborne be back in Suramar.

The same way Trolls and Blood Elves were justified into both being Horde. Because reasons.<br />
<br />
Blood elves were kind of pushed to join the Horde and they haven't really had any specific encounters with Darkspear Trolls - because these are the ones that were in Thrall''s Horde.<br />
<br />
Whereas VOID and LIGHT are quite opposed powers. The new audio drama quite clearly stated that Light isn't accepting VOID at the slightest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet Alleria and Turalyon are still together? Also, Void elves joining Alliance doesn't mean that Alliance is suddenly pro-void, just as Blood Elves joining the Horde didn't mean that the Horde is suddenly pro-fel. They may just band together against their common enemy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dark Iron dwarves - well they are cool mostly. probably wont play a dark iron dwarf myself, but i dont mind them.<br />
<br />
Void elfs - void what? Oo.. well alli got they blood elf models at least, if that was the intent, in exchange to give horde night elves. oh, i mean, Nightborne...<br />
they will be a new sight on alliance side, so theyre intersting to the eye. i hope those purple wings are only the shoulders and not the void elves themselves :D<br />
<br />
Nightborne - well, good job, you've just made the &quot;horde&quot; 87,5% elfs....<br />
not to mention that Nightborne are (and should be) totally neutral toward both factions<br />
(the same stand for LF draenei and Highmountain Tauren too)<br />
<br />
HighMountain tauren - well they are cute, but nothing special, antlers. great. and you cant change at the barbershop, you must lvl up a new character. hahaha<br />

<br />
Because Tyrande basically chided and derided them for their addiction and need of the moonwell, not having learned from he past. While the Blood Elves showed them sympathy and understanding. They share some commonality with the Blood Elves having both had a magical addiction that almost destroyed them, and potential fall. They have FAR more in common with Blood Elves than Night Elves.</div></div><hr />

I would probably look at this more of a gameplay mechanic than a lore mechanic for some of the sub races. It makes sense for Dark Iron Dwarves and trolls, sure. The elves though? Nightborne and Void Elves would just as likely join the opposite faction, and some would just be &quot;meh I just wanna stay in Suramar&quot;. Just think of it as an appearance thing more than &quot;Hey guys we recruited these people&quot;</div></div><hr />

You can click the symbols to switch between male/female pictures of the race. Since they have showed full body pics of both options of them all, it's safe to say all new races will be able to be both male and female.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the side note Blizzard has apparently been secretive about this one, and even after the release/reveal of information regarding the expansion they still keep most of stuff in the dark, for a reason. Just because this expansion is titled 'Battle for Azeroth', it doesn't mean that Alliance and Horde will munch on each other the entire time. I believe the actual reason behind this war are the old gods using their pawns to create struggles and opportunity to weaken the mighty force that, united, managed to halt the Legion invasion and in the end doom them.<br />
<br />
If we recall back to what hints and whispers were pointed towards us, from both Varimathras and that creature in the Emerald Nightmare, we have traitors and servants of the void among our ranks. I have said it numerous times by now since the reveal, and I'll do so again - this is but a proper and perfectly planned groundwork for what's to come. Great expansion and story-telling is ahead of us, though this time Blizzard is really secretive about their approach and for a reason - Void Lords and Old Gods work from the shadows.<br />
<br />
If this is all true shouldn't they hint at it sooner? Seems like a lot of people might not get the xpac if they think this is all there will be?</div></div><hr />

Unfortunatly death knight is not among the void elf list. Death Knight is not among anything's list... Sucks really, monks are plentiful there but DKs didn't get a single new racial combo. In b4 &quot;lorewise these races weren't around when LK raised DKs&quot;, yep, so what, new DKs can be raised to this day, if you played a DK in Legion you just rose a few, including Nazgrim, Whitemane and Trollbane (who then became your class hall followers). <br />
<br />
Maybe it's so people don't create DKs to get the racial armor faster... because skipping these 38 levels is so important... sigh. (Yep these races start at 20 and DKs at 58.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it is a matter and secret style of approach for marketing purposes. Up until now, we always knew what the expansion was about and it killed immersion.<br />
<br />
To explain what I mean, I'll use simple examples. So far our characters were doing quests, investigating what causes the curse and not knowing what the actual threat is. Perfect examples of this would be beginning of TBC (we thought Legion attacks through the portal and Illidan is presented as main villain later on), beginning of Cata (suddenly world sunders out of blue, people are scared for their lives and world itself is shattered, later on our characters realize its Deathwing blowing stuff up) and then finally WoD, where alternate universe time traveling orcs attack us through the portal thanks to Garrosh, and we go there to face them - but Legion already gave script papers to Gul'dan and he set their plan in motion.<br />
<br />
Now, our characters experienced all that with a shocker and were confused 90% of the time. But we, players, knew about what is to come and while we loved and enjoyed the story there, there was no immersion at all.<br />
<br />
In some cases even expansion names gave away the plot. Take Legion for example, it surely can't be about Defias Brotherhood with a name like that.<br />
<br />
Now look at this, Battle for Azeroth. Who battles who there? Horde and Alliance? Sure, and that is all we know. I personally believe that concept will last for a patch or two, and then Void Lords fu*k our sh*t up like never before because we were careless. That is only my personal assumption.<br />
<br />
But with marketing like this, both US and OUR CHARS go into the unknown and don't know what to expect. Sure we fight each other in faction wars, and then?<br />
<br />
I hope you see the point I'm trying to make. Typing from my phone at the moment so it's kind of hard to say all I wanted perfectly. I'd gladly say more on my view of things when I'm back on PC in case there are further questions or discussion regarding what I just said.</div></div><hr />

Expect to get around 75% of the content you paid for but need to play on Horde to experience (like in Cata and MoP). Tbh doesn't matter if you're Alliance or Horde, you're only getting half of the levelling experience / allied races storylines etc., you have to play both factions actively to get most of the content. Since at least wotlk majority of expansion zones were shared and except few faction-specific hubs and reps you weren't missing that much for playing only 1 faction. <br />
<br />
Legion made players miss tons of content unless they levelled tons of different classes (class campaigns, mount questline, mage tower challenges etc.), BFA seems to make you miss content unless you play both factions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given past experience in Cata and MoP, you will miss even more content if you're alliance. Horde didn't miss anything by not doing alliance quests. i.e. they see the same story and quests. Alliance missed out on a lot. Worgen starting zone, robbo kitty and other lazy and hacked scenarios for alliance vs fully fleshed out questing scenarios for horde.</div></div><hr />

Sucks really, monks are plentiful there but DKs didn't get a single new racial combo. In b4 &quot;lorewise these races weren't around when LK raised DKs&quot;, yep, so what, new DKs can be raised to this day, if you played a DK in Legion you just rose a few, including Nazgrim, Whitemane and Trollbane (who then became your class hall followers). <br />
<br />
Maybe it's so people don't create DKs to get the racial armor faster... because skipping these 38 levels is so important... sigh. (Yep these races start at 20 and DKs at 58.)<br />
<br />
I believe this question was asked by several news peeps at Blizzcon in interviews, and basically they said allowing them to become DK's when the new races start at 20 is &quot;complicated&quot; which is complete BS IMO. They did say, on the topic of Dark Iron DK's, that it is something that they are still looking into.</div></div><hr />

Really dude? Do you not pay attention to anything?<br />
<br />
(1) Lightforged Draenei. I don't know, The Draenei that have been in the Army of the Light fighting against the Burning Legion?<br />
<br />
(2) Void Elf. Veressa? What? Uhm. Did you not do the storyline quests on Argus? #ALLERIA BECOMES A VOID ELF and if she can BECOME one, She can teach others. (this leads into point 3.<br />
<br />
(3) Nightborn could be done rebuilding. We don't know the timeline for Legion(end) to Battle for Azeroth(Beginning) Could be YEARS.<br />
<br />
(4) Your complain about lack of creativity, but your lack of even the most common knowledge is astounding. Please. Go attempt to troll somewhere else! have a nice day!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Highelf</div><div class="date">2017-11-05, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been wanting High Elves for such a long time now. As someone who grew up on WC2, the High Elf rangers were always my favorite. And now that we have Alleria back, I thought for sure she would rally the remaining High Elves along with Vereesa and they would once again be playable for us and I could play as one of the legendary rangers of old.<br />
<br />
With the announcement of the Void Elves I was a little skeptical at first. I didn't want some purple tentacle looking thing running around. But now that they have a void form that you can switch from like a Worgen I am excited to see what the customization will be like. The fact that Alleria will be their racial leader it seems, is all the more reason for me to play this race at launch. They also seem to keep their blue eyes as well which is a plus. Alleria is able to look 100% normal when not using the Void, so I'm hoping for something similar.<br />
<br />
I wonder if Alleria will train her sister and then go back to Outland and gather up her original Ranger corp that is still holding the fort down at Allerian Stronghold. Taela Everstride would be awesome. Not to mention Theloria Shadecloak, who is depressed of how her people turned out throwing their lot in with Kael. She says that she has no desire to return home and that Terrokar is her home now. Well I'm willing to bet Alleria will 100% change her mind.</div></div><hr />

Had too look up the name, but I remember the story... A seamstress (tailor) in Allerian Stronghold who dreamed of becoming a ranger / farstrider. http://www.wowhead.com/npc=18390/roseleth <br />
<br />
In Legion, she's found in Hunter class hall. http://www.wowhead.com/npc=103427/roseleth So she did leave Outland to work with the Unseen Path, I didn't find if she became a hunter herself or just helping them with outfits as a tailor. When I found that fact I felt happy for this little reference. <br />
<br />
You'd wonder what happened with the rest of Outland crew, since for example Danath is back (he used to be stuck in Honor Hold, but in Legion he's in Warrior class campaign and later on in Dalaran's Alliance inn). Khadgar is obviously on the front page for quite some time, since WOD. High Priestess Ishanah was the leader of Aldor faction in TBC, but we see her in the Priest class hall and later on for everyone as an innkeeper on Vindicaar. <br />
<br />
So obviously the characters who populate Outland during TBC timeline are not stuck there forever. Return of Alleria could indeed give the remaining High Elves a reason to band together, if they cared to. Only question is, why didn't they join Vereesa before, in that case, since she's present in action at least few times like during Isle of Thunder storyline in MOP.</div></div><hr />

I agree I loved seeing Rosa'leth again. My guess is perhaps many of them did not know of Vereesa and what she has accomplished since their departure. Another option is that they are remaining fiercely loyal until their Commander and General returns to take them home, that their duty in Outland is over.</div></div><hr />
