3 &quot;Naaru Sliver&quot; trinkets were in the Pre-PTR 2.4 leak. The Steely Naaru Sliver (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/steelynaarusliver.jpg) has been confirmed on live servers and we can assume that the Blackened and Glimmering had their stats unchanged. Some of these items didn't drop from M'uru yet but it's very likely we'll see them very soon.<br />

it means guilds that spend a lot of time raiding don't also have to spend a lot of time gearing up for pvp. same reason twins drop a pvp neck, same reason old tier tokens can be turned in for older season gear.<br />
<br />
anyway grats to them! i really do miss the days of encounters that took the cutting edge weeks instead of days to master though :(<br />

you seem to have a selective memory about just how &quot;hard&quot; it was pre-TBC ^^ naxxramas was the &quot;slowest&quot; instance, and bosses got cleared at same speed as happened in BT. <br />
<br />
4 horsemen was not a question of having to learn and master the fight, fact is and blizzard have admitted to this themselves, the fight was a brick wall that no raid could get past due to the number of tanks required being excessively high compared to anything previously encountered, as well as gear requirement. Hence rather than being &quot;hard&quot; 4 horsemen were the brutallus of pre-tbc, all down to gear, with the added need of tanks. Furthermore due to guilds like nihilum being forced to steal geared tanks from other naxxramas raids, those other raids got sabotaged and sent back to the stoneage as well as them also having the problem of finding the infamous 6-8 T3 geared tanks.<br />
<br />
look at the clearing speed pre-tbc, its not different from now, only spots it slows down is when a boss is a total gear check, or bugged. Gruul and vashj pre-nerf were also not farmed for a very long time and only killed by the few, but this was due to overtuned gear requirement on gruul (a fight which is simple as dirt), and a bugged vashj.<br />
<br />
Raiding hasnt gotten harder since pre-tbc, it isnt cleared slower. and no matter what blizzard do, if a raid spends 15 hours nonstop on a boss you cant keep them from killing it, heck they would probably go on for 20 hours to kill it, and what then? its still down in 2 days.<br />
<br />
Anyway huge grats to SK gaming! Now go and beat the living daylights out of nihilum on KJ! ;D</div></div><hr />

Ah always nice to see people who remember it clearly. I cant even count the amount of time in my old guild pre TBC that we got confined to mc because everytime we geared a new MT or 2 for bwl they got stolen by a &quot;high end guild&quot; and we had to start all over again. Only way we eventually got threw was several of us had to reroll instead of playing our 8/8 tier 1 guys. Same thing happened when we got into bwl, MTs got stolen to run AQ40 and naxx</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normally Naaru are reborn after they go through a darkened state but in M'urus case it was too much and he turns into Entropius and is then killed. After Kil'jaedens defeat Velen gives Liadrin a shard of M'uru to be used to basically make the Sunwell reborn allowing them true access to the light.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, that is my guess too. :)<br />
<br />
And concerning the trinket (from http://www.sk-gaming.com/content/16892-Muru_DOWN_World_First):<br />
<br />
Skanky: &quot;every1 in the circle, even if you are not in group&quot;<br />
Winternight: &quot;A GM confirmed that the trinket is supposed to buff everyone who steps inside the circle (and are in the raid) but it is currently bugged :(&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a accomplishment yes but I don't see how the encounter is that well done if you can't bring any druids (resto or feral) if you want to beat it. And I doubt they had no druids on to bring.<br />
<br />
Its not so much a problem with the encounter as much as class balance i would have said. Many encounters are stacking shaman as the main healers as they can supply a significant DPS boost as well as AE heal incredibly efficiently. I imagine the holy pallies were only brought along to fill in the requisite 3 blessings.</div></div><hr />

not exactly. if they're using a steadyspam rotation instead of the castsequence, the dps difference is much smaller, and depending on their itemization, sometimes 0. i havn't pulled them into cheeky's yet, but my guess is they're favoring the roughly 40mp5 from the bow over the roughly 7-10 dps difference form the xbow.<br />
<br />
edit: i just pulled munken into my spreadsheet. if he uses illidan's bow with a 3:2 steadyspam, he does 6 more dps (raid buffed) than if he were to use the xbow with a 1:1 rotation. if he were to use the bow from archi, his dps would increase by anoter 7 (14 dps increase from xbow). <br />
<br />
the 40mp5 is just icing on the cake, in this case.</div></div><hr />

Probably not, Nihilum would be complaining that they didn't get as much time on PTR with the first three bosses and would say they were at a disadvantage. The real point though is that people will always find something to complain about. They'll always find a reason they didn't do something first, weren't the best, etc, etc. I'm pretty tired of hearing it myself. The gate system gives all the top guilds a fair starting point on each new boss. In reality what it creates is real boss world firsts instead of instance world firsts. Decide yourself which one is more important.</div></div><hr />

You have to learn the encounter and master it. There are no guides for these bosses, so the website you visit in order to clear Karazhan isn't going to help you. Those videos you watch to even have a shred of a clue how to PvP are not available. These guilds don't waste their time, its not worth it. They down the boss, farm for their core raiders then basically slow way down. Its about being efficient 99% of the time and then making a big push at the right time.
