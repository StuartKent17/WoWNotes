PvP Brawls - Deepwind Dunk<br />
Can you even dunk? If you want to win this brawl, you’re going to need to work on your skills because Dunkball has come to Pandaria. You’ll race to claim balls from the map’s center, or northern, or southern mines, take them to your enemy’s base, and then go for a magnificent long range shot or go all in for the dunk.</div></div><hr />

Short answer: yes<br />
<br />
They're roughly back to where they were when originally introduced. The mobs/bosses have a much higher healthpool and damage than before the most recent scaling patch, and it's no longer just &quot;pull the whole room and steamroll everything.&quot; I understand that people (having never experiencing TW before) may not understand why this is so frustrating, but those of us STILL farming the TW drake mount with nearly 2000 attempts are eye-rolling this pretty damn hard.<br />
<br />
Edit: another thing, especially with the BC dungeons, the 5+sec long CC chains by mobs are still untouched. While this was largely ignorable when you could just AOE everything down in seconds, now it's an issue when a tank gets chain CC'd by mobs lasting 10sec or longer without the ability to dispel it. (Looking at you, Mana Tombs... Arcatraz... etc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should be required to show dropchance from the get go and let people buy it for the TW currency as a back up just in case. Someone will get the short end of the stick, no matter what, with the way it currently is. Not that far from online gambling with loot-boxes the way people obsess and religiously grind these super illusive drops.</div></div><hr />

That depends on how many heroic bosses you have killed.</div></div><hr />

Timewalking is always normal. The 4 M+ dungeon week is always heroic.<br />

Agreed. <br />
<br />
Seriously you can get tier from the timewalking cache. My luck this expansion is utter shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main problem I have with TimeWalking is that you don't even keep your stats %. Your crit-heavy or haste-heavy build ends up being astonishingly boring to play with 10% crit or 12% haste.<br />
<br />
So yeah, if dungeons are now hard... That'll be fun, for sure.</div></div><hr />
