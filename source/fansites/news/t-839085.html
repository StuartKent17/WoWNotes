Paragon clears the first tier of Cataclysm Raiding<br />
I didn't have time to mention it because of the patch notes update recently but Paragon killed Al'akir in 25-Man Heroic Mode (http://www.paragon.fi/news/tier-11-1313-heroic-alakir-25-man-down) on Monday and officially cleared the first tier of Cataclysm raiding! Congratulations to them, see the statement and kill shot below! <br />
<br />
From Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/news/tier-11-1313-heroic-alakir-25-man-down)<br />
This is it - Cataclysm's first tier of raiding has finally been finished. We are quite satisfied with how everything went, despite some setbacks along the way. Right now we are probably even happier to be able to soon go back to our 1 day/week raiding schedule after the merciless non-gated grind.<br />
<br />
Al'Akir was a rather merciless boss overall. The difference on this particular boss is absolutely massive in 10-man compared to 25s due to the area scaling. Congratulations to Dream though for getting the world first in 10-man! Here's to hoping the 25-man version of Al'akir won't get hotfixed or nerfed too soon; everyone else should go through the same soul draining wipes that we had to endure. ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks to all Paragon members for giving their best and making it possible for us to perform as good as we've done. Also thanks to all the supporters and people who have travelled the journey with us. Thanks also go to Steelseries and ASUS. Most of all, thanks to Blizzard.<br />

2200 Rating Weapon Availability<br />
As previously announced (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1567814533?page=1), Conquest weapons requiring 2200 rating were to be made available today, January 25, but have been delayed. We currently plan to make the 2200 weapons available approximately two weeks after the release of patch 4.0.6.<br />
<br />
The decision to further delay availability of weapons requiring 2200 rating was not made lightly. Currently very few guilds are clearing PvE content that drops weapons of this caliber, which would make rated Battlegrounds and Arenas the primary source for top-tier weapons. We of course don’t want players who are pursuing PvE content to feel as though they must engage in heavy PvP to obtain these weapons in order to be competitive or successful.<br />
<br />
We do have some plans to help avoid similar situations in the future, and we’ll share more details when they become available. <br />

Price of Trade goods from Justice Vendors<br />
They're definitely not cost effective and certainly not meant for everyone. Even still, there are scores of people out there with large excesses of Justice Points, with no need (or ability) to obtain more, and nothing to spend them on. This provides an excellent alternative for a select portion of players.<br />
<br />
For everyone else who isn't concerned with the Justice Point cap or how to spend them, these vendors can be disregarded. They're not meant to replace the activity of farming for tradeskill materials for the general populace. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/153734/trade-good-from-justice-vendors-too-expensive))<br />
<br />
Enhanced Maps<br />
We're definitely looking into ways to add more information about raid and dungeon bosses directly into the game client. For example, as discussed at BlizzCon 2010 in the Raids and Dungeons panel, we're already discussing the possibility of incorporating loot tables and boss abilities into zone maps. While &quot;enhanced maps&quot; are still in their formative stages, we love the idea of a player being able to access a variety of information about a specific boss -- including what it drops, what abilities it has, and maybe even some lore about who it is and why everyone in Azeroth wants to kill it -- just by opening her map and mousing over an icon.<br />
<br />
This is all still on the horizon, of course, and would likely be something that's implemented in stages. Nevertheless, we agree that the game could provide better tools for players who are adapting to new content and are currently working to bridge that gap for the future (in a meaningful way that doesn't undermine or spoil the experience).

PvP Sets bonus nerf<br />
Right now some hybrid classes benefit from wearing a pair of 2 piece set bonuses in PvP instead of their 4 piece bonus. We don't much like that behavior though, and we're going to eventually make the two bonuses exclusive so you can only ever have one 2 piece bonus at a time. We're not going to make that change in 4.0.6 as we realize some people have spent a lot of points to buy into the double-2 piece bonuses. However, it is likely we'll make the change at the start of the next PvP season. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/153934/pvp-set-bonus-nerf-is-a-slap-in-the-face))<br />

Arena Weapons Availability<br />
Sometimes, you have to make an unpopular decision, and you take a lot of heat for it. I understand that you guys aren't happy, and I'm sorry about that.<br />
<br />
With regard to the weapon delay, as with any change which affects your gameplay, we always prefer to provide advance notice whenever possible, but in some situations it isn't an option. Unfortunately, this was one of those cases.<br />
<br />
Some of you may recall that there were times in the past when it was common for the Arenas to be flooded by geared raiders actively engaging in arena matches exclusively to acquire weapons for the sake of defeating PvE content. That's not the intended design for arena rewards (that they be part of PvE progression), and that was a situation that we were hoping to avoid now. Raid content is very challenging currently, and as a direct result, there are fewer top tier weapons floating around. What we didn't want was a 'gold rush' on arenas, which would diffuse the competitive space there as well as give PvE focused players an undue advantage for raid content.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, what we really want is parity in the availability of top end PvP and PvE weaponry. We want to see top end PvP and PvE items filtering into the player community at roughly the same time. This delay is an effort to achieve that aforementioned parity in this case. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/153912/blizzard-and-communication-re2200-weapons))<br />

Bilgewater Cartel/Gilneas reputation from Elders<br />
Thanks for the reports! We've implemented a hotfix to correct this issue and ensure that Horde players receive reputation with Bilgewater Cartel when completing Lunar Festival coin quests. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/153622/the-elders-not-giving-gilneas-bilgewater-rep))<br />
<br />
Elders reputation cap<br />
I spoke with our designers a bit more about the Lunar Festival coin quests and what caps, if any, are place on the reputation provided from them. At present, these quests should only provide reputation with Horde (Orgrimmar, Undercity, Darkspear, Thunder Bluff, Silvermoon City, Bilgewater Cartel) and Alliance (Stormwind, Ironforge, Gnomeregan, Darnassus, Exodar, Gilneas) reputations up to 5999/6000 Friendly. This is indeed intended, as many of you have guessed, but we absolutely appreciate the feedback provided in this thread -- both in relation to the Lunar Festival and the reputation cap itself.<br />
<br />
For clarity, there was a separate issue that was preventing eligible Horde characters, regardless of their faction standing, from earning Bilgewater Cartel reputation when completing the Lunar Festival coin quests. Even if they were Neutral with Bilgewater, for example, they were not receiving the 75 reputation as intended. This has since been resolved with a hotfix and should be live on all realms.

Storing Tabards<br />
This is something we've been looking into for a while, and we're confident that we'll be able to implement a feature sometime in the future that gives players a better storage solution for their tabards. We're not sure if that feature will be a cosmetic tab or a drop-down list similar to titles just yet, though; there's still several factors that we need to consider carefully (certain tabards have on-use abilities, for example, which makes storing them a bit more complicated) before we can settle on the best course of action. <br />
<br />
A 75 slot tabard only bag and bank slot doesn't sound any more complicated than a 32 slot mining bag.<br />
Is that really the most elegant solution, though? It might be quickest and simplest, but that doesn't mean there aren't better alternatives available. If we can implement a type of storage that's integrated into the character UI and doesn't take up extra bank space, then that would be ideal.<br />
<br />
That option might not be technically possible due to the way some tabards work, but it's something we're investigating. <br />
<br />
[...] We're not trying to over complicate the situation, but if we're looking at adding a new feature, we want to make sure it's meaningful and appropriate for the game in the long-term. (Or, you know, at least try to.)<br />
<br />
Right now, we're considering a variety of options because we agree that tabard storage would be great, and some of those options extend beyond simply adding another bank slot -- not because they're complex, but because we believe they'll make the most sense and feel the best when you're in game.

Conviction<br />
Right, kind of. We discovered that Conviction (which can give up to a 9% healing bonus) was broken. It affected paladin self heals, but not healing other targets. Since we think that paladin healing throughput is in an overall good place we didn't want a 9% bonus sticking around. So we fixed Conviction and reduced the Holy passive, Walk in the Light, from 15% to 10%. Which actually does end up with a net 4% gain overall, assuming Conviction has near 100% uptime, which isn't too unreasonable.<br />
<br />
Since it was applied in a hotfix the Walk in the Light tooltip won't be updated until 4.0.6. (Source[/b] (][b))</div></div><hr />

Well that makes tons of sense, since we have no control over what sites, exactly, spawns or when, exactly, we get the sword to actually pop up. Brilliant move. They should do the same to the dwarf one, since it has an epic level 85 staff.</div></div><hr />

Kay. Or I could spend 15 minutes herbing/mining, sell those, and make more.<br />

I understand that this is a (small) bone being thrown at the folks grinding archaeology for epics...but come ON. 5g for a solve is just as much a slap in the face as 10s was. Not to mention a slap in the face of history...does Blizzard know what real artifacts go for, relatively, in today's market? Answer--depends on the artifact.

If you're a top caliber PvP'er, you're probably in a top-end PvE Guild that bring in PvP'ers specifically for advantage pieces - weapons/trinkets. This was true even before the Guild Achievements, and it's more prominent now than ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;new USEFUL items&quot; that will be out for JP is whatever is currently only able to be bought from the Valor points vendor. Also any remaining valor points you have get turned into JP on every content patch. Since Valor points have no cap Blizz doesn't want us to stock up on em and be able to be ahead of the curve for the new content by bein able to buy the new current top gear. <br />
<br />
Also the prices for stuff for JP is not supposed to be a way to generate high gold/hr. Its just a way for those who have no need for JP a way to use it so they don't feel like those points are wasted when you do your Valor heroic run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about you take away all 372 iLvL PvE weapons as well and not allow the PvE'ers to use them until PvP'ers can use theirs.<br />
<br />
Just plain... wow. What kind of idiots are working there. You just completely alienated the people that PvP to better suit people that PvE.<br />
<br />
And worst of all, the PvP'ers have to deal with kids that ARE downing heroic bosses bringing their 372 iLvL weapons into arena.<br />
<br />
Yes... because something like 3 guilds in the entire world = Tons of pvp kids around the world running around in 2200 rating.<br />
<br />
Face it, there are way more ppl at 2200 than ppl killing said bosses in heroic. Heroic Raid Bosses now &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 2200 rating.</div></div><hr />

You did not understand my point. I am not saying that it is not true that 25 is harder, but there was no need to mention that in their statement. <br />
&quot;Mine is better than yours&quot; is a bit childish, isn't it? People already know that so it is useless to mention it... Dreams did not say anywhere that 10 man kill is as hard as 25.<br />
So my point is that Paragon mention that just because they want to state they are the best and their kills are the hardest to achieve.... we know that, no need to say it!</div></div><hr />

Kay. Or I could spend 15 minutes herbing/mining, sell those, and make more.<br />

I understand that this is a (small) bone being thrown at the folks grinding archaeology for epics...but come ON. 5g for a solve is just as much a slap in the face as 10s was. Not to mention a slap in the face of history...does Blizzard know what real artifacts go for, relatively, in today's market? Answer--depends on the artifact. But for a vast majority, the bidding would start significantly higher than these prices (were $$ gold pieces...)<br />
<br />
This is a game that is not based in reality, what a real artifact sells for has no bearing on an ingame item. I mean, come on... youre telling me an item like Thunderfury (or any other legendary) would only sell for like 12 gold? Really? Or how about any other multitude of ingame items that have a higher value with players than vendors?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think 7 an hour is fairly reasonable. If you use the stones with the solves, and depending on luck, you can get nearly 1 solve per digsite and you can easily get more than 1 digsite finished (including travel time) in under 8 minutes. Although, if you use the stones with the solves that is also potential gold lost considering you can sell them on the AH for some gold too.</div></div><hr />

Personally I say Blizzard should just scrap this shitty vendor idea totally and let people rot with their capped points. Then we will have less excuses from then about how they don't have enough resources/time to balance the classes properly.<br />

Now there's no direct analogue, but I do agree that PvP weapons in PvE is a problem, just as PvE weapons in PvP is a problem. Maybe if resilience somehow negates damage from PvE weapons and PvP weapons hit less hard but have a bit of resilience penetration on them.

I don't really see the point in this change, I guess it is good if you are still grinding away with arch.

Currently very few guilds are clearing PvE content that drops weapons of this caliber, which would make rated Battlegrounds and Arenas the primary source for top-tier weapons. We of course don’t want players who are pursuing PvE content to feel as though they must engage in heavy PvP to obtain these weapons in order to be competitive or successful.<br />
Oh yeah, whenever PVE players can't have the best weapons in game they have to be kept out of reach so they don't feel like having to PVP but whenever it's the reverse, the answer is &quot;LOL GO RAID LOL&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And lets blissfully ignore that getting the best weapons in game in PVE is considerably harder than getting them in PVP. If you disagree I'll suggest you a deal:<br />
<br />
Firstly, as soon as a boss has ilvl x weapons in his loottable you can also get ilvl x weapons in pvp.<br />
<br />
However, it counts the total global number of weapons equipped of both sources (no matter what weapon, only the ilvl counts) from all realms. And if, lets say 25%, or lets be generous: 50% more people have i.e. the PVP weapon equipped noone in the whole game can equip another of the pvp weapons of that max ilvl until enough people have equipped a max ilvl PVE weapon to bring the ration agai below 50%. And vice versa of cource, if too many people have the PVE weapon compared to PVP the same thing happens to PVE people.<br />
You can still buy (or loot) a max ilvl weapon, but you cannot equip it if the ratios are too screwed up.<br />
<br />
So. Equal temporal availability and you will have about the same amount of people running around with weapons from either source. Fair, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

Archeology isn't a money making profession. It's a secondary. The reason they did this is to make it feel less worthless when you've say uncovered both fossil rares, now all you get is crap worth a few silver. Well they made it give a little money in the process. Frankly I'd rather them make it so you just don't get the dig sites of places you've discovered everything anymore instead.

Whoever finishes it POST-change and the rest of the content deserves the prestige, and I hope blizz yanks it from Paragon. They're no better than those failures Nihilum.</div></div><hr />

And vice versa of cource, if too many people have the PVE weapon compared to PVP the same thing happens to PVE people.<br />
<br />
Cool<br />
<br />
So that means they should release 2200 agi 272 weapons right? Because I'm fairly sure more ferals have Malevolence heroic on my battlegroup than are at 2200 rating. Unless you believe that PvPers should always be held back behind PvErs in getting their highest ilvl weapons so that PvErs can faceroll burst to catch up.<br />
<br />
You know for a fact that if Blizz didn't put these weapons on a bosses loot table or just prevented anyone from doing the bosses until enough people got over 2200 rating there would be widespread outcry and people dropping accounts. Blizz has free reign to shit over PvPers, just not PvErs.</div></div><hr />
