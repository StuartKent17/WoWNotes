Looks like someone pushed the wrong button again, the Brutal Gladiator's Satin Robe and the Brutal Gladiator's Satin Hood have been activated on a server (EU-Arathor), it's the result of an error made by a GM who gave the wrong item to someone (and as I write this news, it's probably already fixed).

Other item stats<br />
Very important note : Most of these items have &quot;outdated&quot; stats, the armor on the sets should be slightly higher. The only armor set up-to-date with the latest version of the PTR is the Paladin one. Keep in mind that all of them are from PTRs and could have been changed since then. <br />

WotLK Alpha fake screenshots<br />
During the weekend we saw a lot of forum posts with screenshots from the alpha test of Wrath of the Lich King attached. They're all fake. And to prevent people from posting them again and again I guess it's worth showing a few of them in news. <br />
<br />
Blizzcon screenshots<br />
Well, these screenshots aren't fake, but they aren't new either. They're just old pictures taken from the Blizzcon and other conventions and they probably aren't representative of the game in its current state. <br />
<br />

<br />
Kanaru's fakes/fan-creations<br />
These one are really popular lately, but sadly none of the following screenshots are official. They've been created by Kanaru (http://www.wowwiki.com/User:Kanaru) and even if the new hairstyles are very nice, it will just be a coincidence if you see any of them in Wrath of the Lich King. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/1_s.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/1.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/2_s.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/2.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/3_s.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/3.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/4_s.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/4.jpg)<br />

<br />
Other fakes<br />
There is also a fake login screen (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/fakeloginwotlkwe1.jpg) from this forum post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2215492691&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=3) and a few other things (character creation screen, skills, etc ...) from people slightly less talented than this guy. Conclusion: There isn't any new screenshot from the alpha, and anything you'll see linked on forums for the next weeks is probably a huge fake. <br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft &quot;hidden&quot; Servers<br />
During the week end, a few people found a way to get the full list of servers (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=6581.0) available and &quot;registered&quot; on WoW's official website. I will only list the ones that aren't available to players below because there might be a few interesting information here (32 Arena Tournament servers ??), however keep in mind that :<br />
Please don't take it as a confirmation of the old zone list post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=1547.0), Blizzard has been using the names of important lore figures for age to name their servers, and having their name as a server really doesn't mean that we're sure to see them in game. <br />
They're internal data, be careful before doing any interpretations. <br />

<br />
Also, that first Dwarf pic with the epic beard of doom would be awesome if it was real! You'd never see their chest armor, tho. XD<br />
<br />
Despite them being old I'd never seen a lot of these screenshots. A few of them look like finished zones, but possibly without finished lighting and environmental effects. Either way, looks interesting!<br />
<br />
Those server names are pretty hilarious. Who is Jesse? And exactly what's going down on the Penguin servers that requires two of them? LOL</div></div><hr />

I guess that most of these servers aren't made for more than maybe 100 people. Just fpr internal testing and messing around.</div></div><hr />

1. Ugh, I hate snow. Games seldom manage to make snowy environments well, they always end up too bright. Especially Blizzard's strategy games have a history of being exceptionally bad at making snowy maps that are playable.<br />

They're not fake because they're not from the alpha. They were gathered from various convention sneak peaks.</div></div><hr />

Of course they are not all physical servers! I highly doubt that you can only run a single instance of a WoWserver on a given physical server (still, must be a lot of physical machines), most likely there are more than just a view on one, since many of them are only for a hand ful people, some probably without any players at all most of the time. I fenture a guess that they are simply servers for the developers, maybe even quest designers, to quickly deploy their build. I also doubt that all of the servers on the list are actually running, much like the realm list sometimes during mantainance where all servers are displayed as offline.</div></div><hr />

One instance is made out of &quot;server-hubs&quot;. So yes, you are completely wrong. You need multiple servers to run 1 instance.<br />

People start to understand where month fee go ^^<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, the only thinks i see in this list :<br />
1436 : USxy-BG. (12 Servers)<br />
1448 : EUxy-BG-zz. (28 Servers)<br />
1472 : KRxy-BG. (4 Servers)<br />
1478 : TWxy-BG. (2 Servers)<br />
1480 : CSBGx. (7 Servers)<br />
1526 : QAx-BG. (2 Servers)<br />
1528 : CNxy-BG. (16 Servers)<br />
<br />
EU get much more Battlegroup server than US.<br />
Its confirmed by the number of server by Battlegroup, but the outsourcing is not managed the same way.</div></div><hr />

No I just know how some things work &gt;.&gt;<br />
Besides these &quot;Battleground&quot; servers which are actually the servers for all the realms in that BG there are: item servers, cache servers, instance (as in dungeon) servers and so on. Just how do you think Blizz keeps track of everything happening to your character 2 years back? .txt files?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Knuffelbert</div><div class="date">2008-04-22, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">itemserver etc are NOT physical servers, they run on physical servers, isn't that obvious? (they would probably be just a database anyway) I'm quite sure that all of the mentioned servers could run on a single physical server without a problem when the load is small (which it is when there are only a handful of players, how much do you think is going on in all those instance servers if noone is in them?). Also I would find it strange if every WoW instance needs it's own &quot;itemserver&quot;, especially if the item database is near the WoW servers (especially for items I wouldn't be surprised if the cost of not running the database on the physical server is actually higher). But be it as it may, the company i'm working for runs several dozens of application servers on a single physical server (just to illustrate the point, WoW is far more demanding on hardware, i know). <br />
Our main product can tax a dedicated server heavily and the database often need to run on a separate server too because of this, but for testing we can run several of them on the same machine, including the databases, because the load is so extremely low. The benefit? No need for dozens mostly unused servers and every developer has his own playground.<br />
<br />
If you have insight in how blizzards folks are working, please tell. I'm quite interested in this. (btw, &quot;I just know how some things work&quot; is not really a good argument, try to back it up please)</div></div><hr />

And a lot of these are still run by a lot of physical servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually said &quot;not all&quot;, everyone playing WoW before probably saw instance or arena server going down and everyone was still playing normally outside of those (and stated this again in all my following posts too).</div></div><hr />
