SK-gaming just posted the movie of their Kil'jaeden world first kill. The video is recorded as WMV in 1680x1050 resolution and Ventrilo is of course included at the end! The RP Event after the kill is included aswell, with voices! (Bare with the black screen for 5 seconds, it's worth the wait).

Yes KJ vanished into the Void with very nice animations)<br />
<br />
Wait a second! So M'uru has resurrected? What happened after Velen said &quot;farewell&quot;? KJ died or he just vanished back into the Void? ???</div></div><hr />

Illy and kael were much more epic than this fight, although the birth and death animations and the RP bit at the end were the best of any fight so far.</div></div><hr />

After raiding the amount of time they did to complete it in that amount of days you would be squeeling to ;)<br />
Very nice vid with an cool ending.</div></div><hr />

That Ventbit is always the best part of SK-Gamings vids imo :D</div></div><hr />

Now they can relax, and as poster above said, you would do exactly the same if that was you.</div></div><hr />

Very nice vid with an cool ending.<br />
<br />
<br />
My guild squeals too, and I go and reach for the volume control when it happens. I just don't care to listen to it in an otherwise awesome kill video.<br />
<br />
Also, yes I nerdsqueal as well, just I don't have the reflex to push my push2talk button when I do, among other things I don't convey over vent.</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
<br />
it was amazing music/transitions and nerds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My only question/complaint is you list only 2 paladins in your raid comp info but when the video starts killing stuff around the sunwell you all have 4 greater blessings all with 27 minutes left?</div></div><hr />

Awesome quality, great fight (GJ to blizzard on this one -- audio, voices, emotes all of it was splendid), great editing. The dialog between Kalecgos and Aveena was so great to have in the fight, instead of just on the combat log; fitting the music around it was all the better :D <br />
<br />
Just some awesome work here.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fugazi</div><div class="date">2008-05-30, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cons:<br />
- Too loud music during fight compared to NPC speech<br />
- Black screen at beginning of end-talk<br />
<br />
Pros:<br />
- Everything else :p</div></div><hr />

Yes KJ vanished into the Void with very nice animations)<br />
<br />
Wait a second! So M'uru has resurrected? What happened after Velen said &quot;farewell&quot;? KJ died or he just vanished back into the Void? ???<br />
He didn't die, that's just a small % of his power. But we probably won't see him again at full power till after the Lich King.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Card</div><div class="date">2008-05-31, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The screaming when they kill him is the best part of the vid, I've been on first kills of bosses we wiped on for weeks, I remember our first Vashj kill and the explosion on TS, say whatever you want, it's an awesome feeling, it's what keeps PvE alive and kicking.</div></div><hr />
