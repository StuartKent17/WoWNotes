The World of Warcraft team is hard at work preparing for the next phase of testing, and each of you will be invited back to participate. We're also happy to inform you that we will not be wiping characters as we transition from alpha to beta. However, all current alpha characters will be locked for a short period of time, allowing new players entering the beta sufficient time to catch up. <br />
<br />
We look forward to seeing you all again in the Wrath of the Lich King beta test. <br />

2.4.3 Undocumented changes / Bugs<br />
There are a few more changes to add to the list of 2.4.3 &quot;features&quot;. Most of these bugs were listed and shamelessy stolen on Elitistjerks.com (http://elitistjerks.com/f15/t27229-patch_2_4_3_-_patch_notes/p14/)<br />
<br />
Interface<br />
It seems that linking (shift+click) quests doesn't work anymore on some realms. <br />
Titan Panel might bug your interface and cause the GM Ticket icon to show up even if you don't have any ticket open. Please download the latest version (http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/618/) to fix this bug.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hyjal Summit<br />
Rage Winterchill now casts Death &amp; Decay while Frost Nova is still active. <br />
Anetheron doesn't seem to summon his infernals. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sunwell Plateau<br />
The Fel Lightning from Sunblade Protectors now deals Nature+Shadow damage instead of Fire damage before the patch. It looks like it's ignoring completely single-element absorption spells like Shadow Ward. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Of course, players who attended the WWI can now redeem their Tyrael's mini pet code in game ! <br />

Arena Tournament Second Qualification Round Concludes<br />
After several weeks of intense competition, the 2008 World of Warcraft Arena Tournament's second qualification round has come to an end. The qualifying teams from the second qualifier will join those from the first to face off in their respective regional finals. Regional finals will be held in the coming months in Boston, Madrid, Seoul, and Taipei. For more information on the tournament, please visit our Arena Tournament information (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/index.xml) page. Thank you to all of the participants, and good luck to everyone who qualified for the regional finals! <br />

Wrath of the Lich King - Dalaran<br />
<br />
Times change as do alliances or reasons to tolerate (at the least) an enemy. Dalaran and the magic users thereof (and of all the world) are finding themselves hard pressed to defend themselves against the Blue Dragonflight and Malygos who has woken up (so to speak) and found that, as the guardian of magic, too many have magic at their fingertips and he's not too comfortable with that. He's looking to wipe the slate clean (so I hear) and get things back into control.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, we haven't discussed too much on how we're going to run this city as of yet. During the Worldwide Invitational we did talk about the new Arena that will be located in the Sewers of Dalaran. That should prove as a bit tantalizing for those interested.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind, there are the two starting regions for Horde and Alliance and of course the other places in between that should help serve as stopping points, refill stations and what have you. We'll be revealing more about this all though as we move forward. We are getting there, however, and I'm hoping that people will be pleasantly surprised, and if they aren't pleasantly surprised, I'd like them to at least pretend for my benefit. <br />
<br />
<br />
Wrath of the Lich King &amp; Gold Sinks<br />
Animal rescue centers will be set up by D.E.H.T.A (Druids for the Ethical and Humane Treatment of Animals) and the movement to rid the world of Nessingwary will need funding! Save the penguins! Save the world! /kidding<br />
<br />
Or more seriously, I'm sure there will always be something worth spending your hard earned gold on. The new profession Inscription will be in, many people will most likely work on that, the new Death Knights will be in and people will be working to gear those up, get things enchanted, inscripted, need potions and whatever else.<br />
<br />
Could there be new mounts? That's possible.<br />
Need a haircut? You could spend a little getting one.<br />
<br />
Finally planning that romantic vacation to Grizzlyhills? I hear that costs too. /joking here too<br />
<br />
There will be things to spend on and I'm sure another shift in the economy to some degree. As I've found though, each realm tends to have their differences in what is valuable and prices tend to vary between them. We're working on making sure we're keeping the health of the economy in mind as we're developing. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Indeed, unless they plan to make half mats vendor bought,<br />
inscription won't be a money sink.<br />
As you buy mats from other players you just move golds around not eliminating anything from the world economy.<br />
<br />

<br />
The main expenditures always have been repair bills, AH-fines, mounts. The rest, like head enchants, amount to almost nothing. The only way you could get some money was from mobs and selling items. <br />
<br />
Worked until now remarkeably well, the inflation is really low. Don't see this changing in WotLK really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, Rage also seems to cast frostbolt more often (like three in 8 seconds at the beginning of the fight). So he is harder, but still not a &quot;cockblock&quot;, like you named it. <br />
<br />
Anetheron however is as tough as Quagmirran in heroic Slave Pens. Free loot.</div></div><hr />
