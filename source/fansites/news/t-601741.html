Arena Addons #2 (http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php#post_aa_add2), and tons of things on the forums (http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php?action=forum). <br />

<br />
We are aware of the problem but not 100% if it was intended by my collegue as a means of unneccessery increase of the difficulty for the Ogri'la gri.... erm reputation gain.<br />
We are working on the problem but not really because the major part here is to actually add more stuff for casual gamers to enjoy, because as all of you know the raid and arena games are perfect and we're constantly looking to nerfbat them to hell so that the casual gamer can crown us Kings of whinefest. Bla bla bla not-gonna-fix bla bla our-designers-ensure-us bla bla bla.<br />
That concludes our live FAQ.</div></div><hr />

That was the bug I was referring to yes. At least it's something I suppose.</div></div><hr />

I don't recall Blizzard ever changing the contents of a patch they already sent to the downloader...but I've only been playing a little over a year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh course, because the patch isn't on the live servers yet. Another good reason to always use the launcher. ;)</div></div><hr />
