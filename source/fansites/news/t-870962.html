We addressed our views on dungeon difficulty several weeks ago, and in the interim many players have asked for us to comment on raid difficulty.<br />
<br />
I chose to use the word &quot;progress&quot; in the title for this blog quite intentionally. We think progression is the key to players having fun. When groups stop making progress, the members get frustrated. When individuals feel like they are stuck, that’s when they start to lose interest. I don’t think it strictly has to do with the flow of loot being shut off. A big part of it is the sense that as you climb up that mountain, you are getting closer and closer to the summit instead of just sliding back down to base camp at the end of each day.<br />
<br />
Let’s consider two extremes. If you complete the raid content very quickly and have Sinestra on farm and everyone has acquired their best in slot items, then you’re probably ready to take a break from raiding. If you worked really hard to get to that point, as many of the current “finished” guilds did, then you’re probably pretty happy about resting until Firelands becomes available. However, if that break point happens too soon, too easily, for too many guilds, then the raiding game can feel empty. Players run out of content before they are ready to run out of content, if that makes sense. Now let’s consider the other extreme, where a guild just has no realistic chance of ever beating a boss. This can be particularly demoralizing if it’s the first boss, but it can happen at any time. That guild might not feel like they are making progress. Many guilds are willing to put in a few weeks trying to master a new encounter, but if it gets to the point where they are wiping for months, there’s a good chance they’ll start to see burnout and thinning ranks. The sweet spot in raid balance for us to hit is that everyone feels like they can still make progress. Content that is too hard or too easy doesn’t meet that goal.<br />
<br />
Raid encounters, to some extent, nerf themselves. This is because every week, the raid members acquire more and more gear. Secondarily, the community acquires more and more knowledge and experience, which translates into better videos, strategy guides, or even UI mods, as well as just more players who have experienced the encounters firsthand. Each week that you are able to kill any bosses, your group’s gear improves overall, through Valor points if nothing else. When Firelands is available, everyone’s gear will quickly take a step up in quality. This will give you an even better chance to beat those bosses that are blocking you now. We wouldn’t be surprised to see some guilds try the first few Firelands bosses one night, while using the next night to go back to get the head and chests from Nef and Cho’gall in order to complete their set bonuses, that is until acquiring new set bonuses becomes feasible. On some bosses, though, better armor and weapons may not be enough because some mechanics just can’t easily be outgeared. To mitigate that problem, our tendency is to nerf content over time just to make sure a wide variety of players see it. The trailblazers get to see the fights before anyone else, but we don’t lock the dungeon door behind them.<br />
<br />
Having said all of that, there are some encounters that still need adjustment. Heroic 10-player modes can often be the hardest to balance, because those groups just don’t have access to the sheer number of tools in one group that the larger raids have. You’ve probably seen some hotfixes go out recently and we might make more adjustments in 4.1. We’ll continue to monitor progress and make adjustments when we feel the time is right.<br />
<br />
Overall, we are pretty happy with our current raid balance. Most guilds that are trying seem to be making some progress. On some realms, we’re seeing pickup groups for at least the earlier bosses, which seems appropriate for where we are in the content cycle. The Heroic versions are particularly challenging, though even in that case, there is a gradient with easier and very difficult bosses. For those of you who feel like you are stuck on progression, we’d like to hear more about why. Are you trying to PUG the encounters? Do you have a very casual guild with a lot of different players each night? Is the problem that you’re undergeared or that the mechanics are too unforgiving? What are the mechanics that are really hard for raid leadership to explain or even understand? Are your tanks exploding, or are your healers running out of mana, or are you failing the berserk timers? We have data on all of this, but it’s useful to hear it from your point of view as well. Remember, our goal is that you beat the fight because you understood the mechanics and executed your tanking, DPS, and healing around those constraints. If you’re just kind of powering through a boss ability or phase that you don’t really understand, then it’s going to be a lot harder for you. As always, feedback on which encounters you are enjoying and which ones you never want to see again is also appreciated, though we’ve gotten a lot of that already, and are designing your Firelands foes with that in mind.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. I am as excited about the Firelands encounters as I am about the current ones. We can’t wait for you to wipe to them, er... see them.<br />

I agree. I'm not a big fan of Ghostcrawler by any means. In fact, I think he's quite a clueless idiot some of the time. That being said, this blog he posted made perfect sense and anyone that finds anything to bitch and moan about in it is just hating for the sake of being a hater.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason our guild has been stuck on progress is mostly due to the fact we lost over half our 10man raiding roster (6 people quit the past 1,5 months). But what really makes 10man progress so difficult is not the boss difficulity, but the fact that you HAVE TO HAVE certain class/spec combos in order to succeed.<br />
<br />
This can be a real &quot;pain in the ass&quot;(so to speak) for a 10man guild that is pretty tightly fitted with solid people.</div></div><hr />

That may be so. But, after playing the game for so long, so many people are just burned out.<br />
We have had to open recrutment for example, or else we would be forced back into 10man. And watching good friends that you enjoyed playing with stop is pretty depressing.</div></div><hr />

There is no progression if you don't let pugs into raids because thats exactly what you did, in this expansion you killed pugs.<br />
<br />
Let me make this clear:<br />
Leave normal mode raids to pugs and causals.<br />
Hard mode should be for the cool pros, elitists and guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel that the Cataclysm content is awesome. From quests to dungeons to heroics to raids. What I have seen in our guild is that the more hardcore players who leveled to 85 very fast and ran dungeon after dungeon are now burning out. I do have requirements to raid set in place from iLevel, enchants, gems, DPS, HPS and tanking ability. In doing so it has made our raiding much more rewarding and not always fail attempts. With Cataclysm players are now understanding it's a different level from WOTLK. As an average guild that is more casual with not the same 10 showing to raid on our raid nights the content can be hard and not forgiving to the more casual raiders. <br />
<br />
In Cataclysm a big part of raiding is not just mechanics and gear as it once was it relies on PLAYER ABILITY and not all players have all of the ability to raid just yet. If players don't have the full ability I think this is what hurts casual players and casual guilds around the board. Now HIGHER HARD CORE guilds who blast through and spend countless hours on strats etc. may be saying what I have always seen in threads about content &quot;Learn to Raid, Learn your class&quot; etc.... but it just isn't that. I think all normal mode raids should be nerfed a bit for the casual player and casual guild so that we can succeed and down bosses. Hard modes are for the Hard Core Guilds, they blow through the normal mode and then start to progress on hard modes where they should be. Casual Guilds are having issues downing the first 1-4 bosses. I know your reading this saying to yourself what a noob go play hello kitty or whatever, but I love the game and real life doesn't allow me to play as a hard core player in a hard core guild and that is fine. All I am saying is f the normal raid content was a little easier casual players and guilds would have alot more fun and not lose players who are quitting WOW due to frustration etc...<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler I hope you read this as I am talking from experience and some frustration because seeing the way players are jumping ship and quitting WOW is sad. Having the friends that you have met and played an MMO with for years get frustrated and some burnt out is depressing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc1b96e712e5</div><div class="date">2011-03-18, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting into a good guild is hard, especially if you have created a lot of alts who are not top notch and not even going to the raids yet. But later (in Wotlk late phase) I have raided some. Hardest is when there is something wrong and I cannot figure out what the heck is wrong. For example something keeps dps too low or you just don't get something. Well that is badness of the player I guess. I had trouble in ToC, never got through it. But on the other hand Onyxia was easy and I liked it because I got over with it fairly soon. I have not even seen all the raids. For example I didn't do all of Naxx or Ulduar, not even when they became easier. For pugs the difficulty would be nice if you could actually finish raids. But yeah, good guilds would feel that raids are too easy, if pugs can run them like heroic farming...<br />
<br />
Anyway, raids shouldn't be too easy, but at the same time, if I don't get to raid (because of no good guild, no high enough toon, low gear, or what ever) the raids are just a dream. I don't like that most people seem to raid until 00:00 at night my local time, it makes it harder to find a good guild. I need to sleep too.<br />
<br />
Random dungeons are fine, because any normal day time I join queue, I get to an instance. I have farmed tons of normal and heroic dungeons, but I have not even finished most of or almost all of the raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not for me :S<br />
I am getting worried they are actually starting to believe in the &quot;feedback&quot; to the community themselves though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids are not too hard! There is just not a steady enough stream of new content and there is absolutely no justification given how insanely big their budget should be.<br />
<br />
Let us be honest here, hardmodes are, among many things, first and foremest an awesome way to &quot;create&quot; content without spending any money and real workforce on it which seems to be Blizzards new maxime unfortunately(not so new actually...).<br />
<br />
You just take the exact same bosses, in the exact same environments and put them into godmode.<br />
Great design from a business perspective, if your players have nothing better to do ingame for ONE WHOLE YEAR other than raid ICC week after week and the next 50 weeks.<br />
<br />
A new raid in 4.1 would be the perfect timing not despite but because people are progressing in current tier hardmodes which is not new content but really just the only content we have left to do and more like&quot;old&quot; content v1.5<br />
Dont get me wrong, I do enjoy the current raiding tier and at this moment I am still having fun progressing with my guild through it but I am fearing the worst for the future, looking at how things are shaping right now in respect to the past.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has gotten lazy, I am sorry to say it but it is the truth. I dont even blame the devs who are obviously passionate about their work to create the best game they can.<br />
It is more than likely the guy tightening the purse strings.<br />
<br />
You know, they guy saying : New content? Why? There is still so much to recycle without having to spend resources. Lets bring back ZG and ZA!<br />
<br />
I dont give a flying frack about them thanking me for buying their games in their 20 year anniversary self adulation video but I would damn well enjoy to see the appreciation reflect in the work they put into the game, which is just not happening and quite frankly I am getting fed up with it.</div></div><hr />

My fear was that they would go back to ToC style face roll raids in firelands. I agree that hardmodes are really lackluster expecially when we've seen how dynamic they can be in Ulduar. I'm not praising Blizzard for being great I'm jut excited that the QQ hasn't made them turn it into wrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm no GM, but making normals even more easier than they already are would be wrong. <br />
Think like this, there's, lets say 5 different kind of guilds. <br />
1. Top World Guilds (13/13)<br />
2. Hardcore Guilds (Lets say 9/13)<br />
3. Great Guilds (Some Heroic downed)<br />
4. Guilds (Cleared 12/12)<br />
5. Casual Guilds (9/12)<br />
<br />
The Names are just there for some sort of Nametagging.<br />
<br />
Let's not care about guild1.<br />
Guild2 is clearly skilled players, probably everybody has almost full hc gear aswell. They will prolly down the last 4 soon, either by succeeding in their current state (bosses) or when they'd get nerfed.<br />
Guild3 are what I should say is normal for a guild today in progress, got skilled players, also some bad, but just can't find the time to progress enough.<br />
Guild4. Is a okay guild, probably alot of casuals that doesn't have time to progress more than some hours a week, now they're trying to gear up all their players. <br />
Guild5. Well either you suck, or you just play like 2 hours a week. <br />
<br />
Now lets say they nerf the normal content and buff the heroic one. <br />
<br />
Guild1 will have more of a challenge, which is fun for them! Though I think it is tuned for the absolute elite (paragon etc.) and then nerfbat it to it's current hardnesslvl.<br />
Guild2 will have a lot slower progress, which ain't fun for them, as I believe myself that they already are in somewhat meant to be progress (somewhere between guild3/2 i think)<br />
Guild3 will have problems with the first bosses, burned out wiping on them for a long time, since normal is so much easier.<br />
Guild4 will have an fast progress experience, and won't be able to down the heroic ones, this will result with some of them will quit because of no raidcontent, some will join other better guilds etc. <br />
Guild5 will be able to see all the 12 encounters! YAY!<br />
<br />
Now I think that it's an minority that hasn't cleared all 12/12 bosses, and I think that the majority of raiding guilds are doing as guild3/2 atm, I don't think that they should nerf normals more, since that playerbase (who will get new gear in 4.2 (t11 from jp)) will be able to down BWD, Tot4W and BoT later on. <br />
<br />
Also, if everybody could reach the heroic content that much easier, more people will consider themselves &quot;good&quot; enough for heroics, and demanding blizz to nerf it. <br />
<br />
Difficulties are fine as they are!</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, exactly. I mean we need to call back in mind the time when the real separation of hardmodes and normal modes was introduced... it was with ToC which was just a giant slap in the face given how horrible that tier was.<br />
<br />
The encounter design for cataclysm in general but also the atmosphere of the raids (and the fact that all three are quite varied in their environments and mechanics) are awesome, I really feel like it is the best raiding tier after Ulduar right now.<br />
But it is not enough, maybe my expectations for cataclysm were too high but I dont see a lot of progress. I think it would be much better to have raiding tiers overlap each other so while you are still doing hardmodes of the &quot;old&quot; tier you also have new content to progress through which might require normal raiding guilds to aquire the hardmode loot of the previous raids before you can progress after a while.<br />
<br />
GC seems to hint at that being a possibility for the future but if new content is released so slowly I dont expect it to be a great thing :(</div></div><hr />

Great design from a business perspective, if your players have nothing better to do ingame for ONE WHOLE YEAR other than raid ICC week after week and the next 50 weeks.<br />
I'm honestly not trying to pick a fight here, but aren't you basically saying that you dislike hardmodes because the majority of the playerbase sucks?<br />
<br />
If the overall skill of the players would be higher more people would steamroll the content and Blizzard would have a reason to release new content. As it is now, and as it was back in the end of Wrath, people weren't exactly steamrolling ICC, even with the insane nerfs to the raid.<br />
<br />
If you have a problem grasping the concept, think of normals and heroics as two separate raids. Instead of designing twice the amount of raids per content-patch, Blizzard is adding another layer upon the existing tier to allow more people to try that content. <br />
<br />
This way casuals get to experience the raid via normal encounters, and more serious raiders get to experience the challenge they are after in heroic modes. So before you label Blizzard as lazy you might want to speculate some on why things are the way they are. Think back to Vanilla or TBC times and compare them to now and you'll surely understand the concept.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure how accurate guild ox is but that itself shows that more non hard core or world guilds are really struggling.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I love the challenge, but after a while it gets so damn frustrating and getting frustrating over game play is nuts. On our server via guild ox we are ranked 57th in 10 mans which isn't to bad I assume.<br />
<br />
I just think normal modes are and should be for normal raiding guilds and and hard modes are for the hardcore and world guilds. Hard modes should give alot better gear if you ask me. It can be the same gear but stats are greatly improved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No matter what content you create. The hardcore will complete it ahead of designers schedulers schedule. They will work 10X as hard if need be to complete it. Work day in and day out till content is downed. No matter what is created the hardcore will finish it.<br />
<br />
That simply will not happen for the casual raider / gamer.<br />
<br />
Now, I ask which group is the largest of the 2?<br />
<br />
Trying to balance game design between the 2 groups is half the problem blizzard has now. Those 2 groups can't be designed for evenly and designing any content trying to is bound to not turn out well. This expansion proves that. It was designed to be more difficult and more unforgiving.<br />
<br />
The player base in turn turned difficult to be with and unforgiving to each other because of the design. It was designed to be unforgiving and thats what blizzard got.<br />
<br />
Pick a side (the majority) - Go with that and be done. Stop trying to please everyone cause it screwing things up more and more over time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont really get it :)<br />
Do you mean because it took people so long to down heroic LK in 25man?<br />
I was talking about the fact that for one whole year there was no new content created and hc lk was intentionally overtuned because they had nothing else in store. Well...except for Halion which was just one lonely boss encounter.<br />
<br />
If I am getting your meaning right, keep in mind the playerbase can only &quot;suck&quot; at what Blizzard wants them to do and they are creating the game. Which is also just a game and not a competition with a prize or anything. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If the overall skill of the players would be higher more people would steamroll the content and Blizzard would have a reason to release new content. As it is now, and as it was back in the end of Wrath, people weren't exactly steamrolling ICC, even with the insane nerfs to the raid.<br />
<br />
Exactly, that is both the reason and the result of why they tune encounters so players cannot steamroll it. In fact they tune encounters in a way that only a tiny number of the playerbase will ever clear the current content in every tier. As a player, you dont force them to release new content faster. You will force them to release content that will make your guildleader shit bricks, which is exactly what they are doing now and have been doing in ICC.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have a problem grasping the concept, think of normals and heroics as two separate raids. Instead of designing twice the amount of raids per content-patch, Blizzard is adding another layer upon the existing tier to allow more people to try that content. <br />
Exactly the problem, they are not two separate raids but the exact same except for the fact that in one copy of the instance BossX &quot;cheats&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am playing in a semi-&quot;hardcore&quot; guild. We are not competing directly for first kills but we have downed 6 hardmodes in 25 man so far and I dont see us clearing the content until 4.2. I am okay with that though. <br />
<br />
Also I do NOT hate hardmodes, I understand the concept very well and I am not one of those elitists to begrude &quot;casuals&quot; or simply less ambitious or as you would call it &quot;sucky&quot; players :-P to have fun in this game.<br />
<br />
All I am saying is that hardmodes are no substitute whatsoever for proper new content. Both can exist side by side but the reason I called Blizzard lazy, which probably was not the right word, is they choose not to go about it that way and instead have actually introduced hardmodes as the very substitute for proper new content.<br />
<br />
which sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
one quick edit: My opinion is based from what we have seen so far this expansion. We dont know when 4.2 will hit but I am expecting it at the end of May at the very earliest. And if they keep that pace it is just not not enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that's exactly what hardmodes are there for. You clear the normals, and then you clear the hardmodes. Less than 10% of the playerbase has even seen a heroic raid last I checked. I've just never understood the logic behind wanting more content you can't clear.</div></div><hr />

I know that is what theywere made for, that is what I said :D<br />
And that sucks.<br />
<br />
Why more content?Because more is better. Not always ofc but when it comes to principally repetitive things like raiding it absolutely applies. You dont go to the movies to watch the same film again and again and again. Diversity is the word here. <br />
<br />
It is more fun to wipe for days on a new boss than it is to wipe for days on the hardmode of a boss you have already done a LOT of times. By that logic, it would be OK for you they add a Hardermode and uberhardmode and ExtremelyHardmode instead of creating new raids? I dont think so.<br />
<br />
I know not one person, not even casual or simply bad raider, who enjoyed having to raid ICC for one year. Even the most &quot;casual&quot;(in most cases this meant simply bad) guilds should have been done with content long before december last year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AOE is also a problem. They nerfed most AOEs, but designed encounters with it being a requirement - Maliorak again, and Magmaw. This will improve as we get gear, but right out of the gate it can be a little harrowing.</div></div><hr />

They have minimal trash and none of the fights are boring tank and spank fights. It requires tanks, dps, and healers to not be asleep at the wheel (or greatly overgear the encounter).<br />
<br />
Ascendant Council is a good example of a well-designed encounter. Each boss plays off of each other and the raid utilizes one boss's abilities to counteract the other boss's abilities.<br />
<br />
However, the biggest problem with WoW right now is that there is not enough to do at level 85 outside of raids. I think a lot of the decisions Blizzard has made to streamline the game has been good, but comes with bad side-effects. Now that there is a shared 10-man and 25-man lockout, people don't double raid (do both 10-man and 25-man). With faction rep tabards it is a joke to zerg to exalted with all the Cataclysm factions, so people aren't doing a lot of dailies. The only real dailies people run every day are the Tol Barad dailies and those get old real fast. They just aren't that enjoyable. Sure we don't hang around all day AFK in Dalaran now ... we hang around all day AFK in Org or SW. Heck, the cooking and fishing dailies don't even take us away from the city.<br />
<br />
There needs to be more filler tasks to keep us engaged while not raiding.</div></div><hr />

haha yeah, exactly what I got from it too.<br />
<br />
Not only do we have to wait longer until new content gets released, we can also look forward to raiding &quot;old&quot; content by then because they will keep overtuning it so except for the top200guilds nobody will be done by the time they release it. Great times ahead folks!<br />
(I like the basic idea of it A LOT. The only problem here is firelands is not coming in 4.1 so we can look forward to further raiding content that is half a year old by the time 4.2 finally hits...what a joke)<br />

I can almost see it like a picture before my eyes, we will be left with the cataclysm version of ICC by the end of the year and forced to raid through it until the end of 2012 again!</div></div><hr />

<br />
heroic 10 is harder to balance than 25 man because you can't assume they have all tools available to them. the hard part of 10 heroic is having the right comp for each encounter. i've not raided 10 man heroic, but i'm sure they'd be easier if you could pull different classes in for different encounters (which isn't feasible for many guilds).</div></div><hr />

I can imagine that is right.<br />

Easy solution is - make normal modes even more trivial. Make hardmodes even harder.<br />
<br />
But push new content out faster. great content that is balanced and polished and not ToC 2.0.<br />

Ppl will have the chance to overgear by a lot actual instance so they will have the chance to see content.<br />
And when new content hit just remember that will be easier to beat normal bosses. Why? Because all bosses will say what ability they do. Hardcore guilds will not need to wipe over and over to understand what this or there ability do. Casual guilds can spent 5 min looking to that before engage boss. Pugs will not need to pray that everyone read the tactic. One of the big problems of pugs is that ppl see videos and think that the boss is easy and don't read abiltiy, what dmg they do, what i should avoid and why, when i have to use cds, etc.<br />
Spending 5 min before one boss to read abilities will help even more then the RL /rw what you should avoid. Will prevent many people go to a boss knowing he has to avoid that somehow and because yes he should increasing the success of many raids. <br />
Everyone should remember RL shouting about difile but half of the ppl did not understand how it works before did that over and over. With some blizzard ui showing what defilie actualy do I bet you save lot of wipes.<br />
So no! Don't nerf future raids. (maybe 1, 2 ability on old content so pugs do it easy for achivs in future)<br />
This if fine and will be easier with new ui.</div></div><hr />

why not make the jump to heroics then? just start with the eaiser ones (halfus/chim) and see how you feel about them. if you've cleared normal mode, you're going to get pretty bored waiting for normal mode firelands.</div></div><hr />

There is no progression if you don't let pugs into raids because thats exactly what you did, in this expansion you killed pugs.<br />
<br />
Let me make this clear:<br />
Leave normal mode raids to pugs and causals.<br />
Hard mode should be for the cool pros, elitists and guilds.<br />

Yeah lets just obliterate the end game scene for the majority of the raiders. IE, the middle class raiders who raid 2 nights a week and are working on heroics now. That makes a whole lot of sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that happens in every MMO. even MMO's that have only been out for a few months. people burn out at different rates, and you can't control when and if they do. no guild on my servers, or any major guild that i have heard of has kept every single member that they started out with. they get tired, or they get bored, or they get frustrated. that doesn't mean the game is tiring, or boring, or frustrating. it means that is all the willpower, or attention span the quitters had.<br />

My feedback on the original forums:<br />
<br />
The reason our guild has been stuck on progress is mostly due to the fact we lost over half our 10man raiding roster (6 people quit the past 1,5 months). But what really makes 10man progress so difficult is not the boss difficulity, but the fact that you HAVE TO HAVE certain class/spec combos in order to succeed.<br />
<br />
This can be a real &quot;pain in the ass&quot;(so to speak) for a 10man guild that is pretty tightly fitted with solid people.<br />
<br />
Sorry to burst your bubble but if you have 10 solid people then you would have the common sense not to stack certain classes or specs. I am guessing its another group of casual friends who wanna play a certain toon and of course the gm being the buddy he is, says sure, then whines about content later.</div></div><hr />

i didn't know &quot;casuals&quot; had access to 372/379 gear.... oh wait nvm.. your one of those &quot;i don't want the peasants to have gear that has it's name in purple color text&quot; people that doesn't even acknowledge the argument that their hardcore gear is still superior to anything a casual can get.</div></div><hr />

Think like this, there's, lets say 5 different kind of guilds. <br />
1. Top World Guilds (13/13)<br />
2. Hardcore Guilds (Lets say 9/13)<br />
3. Great Guilds (Some Heroic downed)<br />
4. Guilds (Cleared 12/12)<br />
5. Casual Guilds (9/12)<br />
<br />
The Names are just there for some sort of Nametagging.<br />
<br />
Let's not care about guild1.<br />
Guild2 is clearly skilled players, probably everybody has almost full hc gear aswell. They will prolly down the last 4 soon, either by succeeding in their current state (bosses) or when they'd get nerfed.<br />
Guild3 are what I should say is normal for a guild today in progress, got skilled players, also some bad, but just can't find the time to progress enough.<br />
Guild4. Is a okay guild, probably alot of casuals that doesn't have time to progress more than some hours a week, now they're trying to gear up all their players. <br />
Guild5. Well either you suck, or you just play like 2 hours a week. <br />
<br />
Now lets say they nerf the normal content and buff the heroic one. <br />
<br />
Guild1 will have more of a challenge, which is fun for them! Though I think it is tuned for the absolute elite (paragon etc.) and then nerfbat it to it's current hardnesslvl.<br />
Guild2 will have a lot slower progress, which ain't fun for them, as I believe myself that they already are in somewhat meant to be progress (somewhere between guild3/2 i think)<br />
Guild3 will have problems with the first bosses, burned out wiping on them for a long time, since normal is so much easier.<br />
Guild4 will have an fast progress experience, and won't be able to down the heroic ones, this will result with some of them will quit because of no raidcontent, some will join other better guilds etc. <br />
Guild5 will be able to see all the 12 encounters! YAY!<br />
<br />
Now I think that it's an minority that hasn't cleared all 12/12 bosses, and I think that the majority of raiding guilds are doing as guild3/2 atm, I don't think that they should nerf normals more, since that playerbase (who will get new gear in 4.2 (t11 from jp)) will be able to down BWD, Tot4W and BoT later on. <br />
<br />
Also, if everybody could reach the heroic content that much easier, more people will consider themselves &quot;good&quot; enough for heroics, and demanding blizz to nerf it. <br />
<br />
Difficulties are fine as they are!<br />
<br />
I so agree with this!!! Content is faceroll and insanely easy, when a group of players can go do 12/12 in one night, it is hella easy. We got on our alts and in blues and green cleared 7/12 laughing along the way about how hard the content was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least with the firelands comments, you can probably expect the normal loot to be on par with Sinestra loot (i379) so it basically forces you to go back in clear heroic T11 to progress further into the later parts of T12.</div></div><hr />

I guess all of us in the normal raiding guilds, casual guilds who call ourselves casual players who actually do put in the time to research toons abilities, strats etc., who do have a life outside of a game, but may not have the exact play ability that YOU the almighty have should just sit quiet. <br />
<br />
As much as I hate to say it I don't QQ about the game I like the challenge, but just as the better skilled players BS on forums on how they hate the QQ from lesser skilled players just erks the hell out of me.<br />

Make the normal modes a little nerfed and hardmodes HARD real hard and lets see what the so called Elitists and Hardcore players like it. I am sure they would run to play Hello Kitty</div></div><hr />

I mean Casual as guilds who have average raid ability and play time. I can see what the Hardcore raiders are saying as well I just think there should be balanced between normal and hard modes a bit better as most casual/normal playing raiding guilds will never see hard modes.<br />
<br />
How much time does it take to do these faceroll bosses? I mean really!! I think there should be another rank underneath casual, something like the players that nobody wants or the players that fill the guild bank daily so they get raid spots. <br />
<br />
The guild I am in is 3/12 heroic and by no means are we hardcore or even on that much, we only raid 2 nights a week. It is funny when I hear my casual friends say they dont have time to watch vids or read strats but they farm or run alts all day while sitting in vent whining about content all day.<br />
<br />
Lets face it the amount of good players left in this game is getting smaller and smaller while the casuals seem to be growing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is the mention of life outside of the game always mentioned? You realize that most casual guilds play alot more than raiders? i watch many casual guilds wipe night after night never progressing but not because of the difficulty of content but because of the way the guild is ran. When you put a 10man together you think of diversity among classes and what you will need to progress not picking people because they are your buddy. <br />
<br />
I just tried helping a friend that was actually still stuck on magmaw and after a night of wipes it was obvious that with him leading the guild would never go anywhere. Every decision is sugar coated and always worrying about hurtings someones feelings. Just like the boomkin in that guild that was doing a million less dmg on adds than the other range, he was told to aoe more and he got pissed. He went as far as to calling people elitiests because they were looking at meters trying to figure out why the adds werent dying.<br />
<br />
Blizzard makes this real easy. They will keep nerfing the game and other people will continue to leave for new mmo's that watch and see what blizzard is doing to make people quit. They will avoid that and wow will be all casual, with a few people getting on for quick clears occasionally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wouldnt you rather kill bosses before they are nerfed for the sastifaction? I know when people mention clearing or killing a certain boss, there is usually someone who says, ya after he was nerfed. If you look at the blue posts, faceroll bosses such as magmaw has had his health reduced. A really easy boss where nothing changes at all was nerfed. Why?Was he hard? Really? If you cant aoe adds then return to boss and move out of stuff on the ground then likely wow is a very hard game.<br />
<br />
As far as the idea of hard modes cant be done unless 12/12 is complete, I am fine with that idea. But remember blizzard took all of that out when casuals couldnt get into raids because of it, or because they didnt want to put the time in like the other people before them.</div></div><hr />

Well, you might think that, but the numbers don't agree with you.<br />
<br />
Only 20% of the guilds represented on wowprogress have killed normal Nefarian. Only 17% have killed heroic Halfus, the easiest hardmode.<br />

I think some of problems is what server people are on. I also dont think those numbers are correct. I am on lightbringer on my main and 26 guilds are 12/12. And looking at the other guilds that aren't 12/12, most people on the server know why they arent. It isnt because of game difficulty, it has nothing to do with blizzard. It is lack of staying out of shit on the ground, it is lack of common sense, which most encounters are somewhat. We pugged in some people from the other guilds on our alts, they stood in fire and died alot of the time yelling at our healers. So content is rather easy when these people are 8/12 normal.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RokFenris</div><div class="date">2011-03-18, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nod. Blizzard thinks that progression for all players is normals -&gt; heroic raids when actually it is not. Casuals don't even care about heroics, full clear normal is pretty much done.<br />
<br />
This has one little side effect:<br />
Heroic-only bosses is wasted development time for everyone that can't clear the heroic difficulty (I believe that would be around 90% of the player population).</div></div><hr />

Think like this, there's, lets say 5 different kind of guilds. <br />
1. Top World Guilds (13/13)<br />
2. Hardcore Guilds (Lets say 9/13)<br />
3. Great Guilds (Some Heroic downed)<br />
4. Guilds (Cleared 12/12)<br />
5. Casual Guilds (9/12)<br />
<br />
Now I think that it's an minority that hasn't cleared all 12/12 bosses, and I think that the majority of raiding guilds are doing as guild3/2 atm,<br />
<br />
Wow, you're completely wrong here. I just took a look over a GuildOx, and randomly picked the 101st best server on their ranking list (Skullcrusher-US). That's 101st out of 500+ servers, so it's one of the better servers (top 20%), so if you're right, the majority of the guilds listed should have at least one heroic boss downed. Oh look! Only 18 out of 117 guilds have beaten at least 1 heroic boss. That's roughly 15% of the guilds. I think most people call that a MINORITY. And for the 400+ servers below that server, the percentage is generally going to be even lower...<br />
<br />
I think the content is mostly fine as is, a very good challenge, however, to say that the majority of raiders have beaten it all and are ready for Firelands is absolutely laughable when the numbers speak for themselves.</div></div><hr />

And if they keep that pace it is just not not enough.<br />
<br />
I'd expect end of May or in June sometime. That's exactly when it should be. Cata only came out in December, so coming out in June is 7 months. Blizzard has said that they plan on a 6 month schedule for new content, which is a good pace. Its not realistic to expect it faster than that, nor should they push it out faster than that. And yes, I know that June would be 7 months, but since this was the beginning of the expansion there was some time for people to level and the holidays happened right then as well, so I think that's a perfectly acceptable timeline for this content. If you really think that 6 months is too long for content then I don't know how you've been happy with anything released over the past several years - go back and look at patch dates. Ulduar was only 5 months, but that was because Naxx was so ridiculously faceroll that you could clear it in BC gear. ToC was 4 months and that was very clearly a mistake since it stopped a lot of people from finishing up Ulduar and was acknowledged as a mistake. 6 months is a good balance between giving people enough time and rushing things or taking too long (hello ICC).<br />
<br />
<br />
heroic 10 is harder to balance than 25 man because you can't assume they have all tools available to them. the hard part of 10 heroic is having the right comp for each encounter. i've not raided 10 man heroic, but i'm sure they'd be easier if you could pull different classes in for different encounters (which isn't feasible for many guilds).<br />
<br />
If you haven't done heroic 10s then you probably should just stick to commenting on what you actually know.</div></div><hr />

As others keep whining about how hard content is on normal then it may seem that cho'gall and Nef are wasted time also. One funny thing I have noticed is how many meaningless achievements and how many alts alot of my casual friends have. The point being that they tell me they dont have the time to raid more to progress yet he is on a lot more than myself. I have seen his guild go hours doing achievements but they dont have the time to raid.</div></div><hr />

Those guilds are usually more casual and are switching members regularly - spending more time teaching new ppl about the mecanics. And bosses that are 3 phases can be very hard on new groups every week. <br />
<br />
The big problem ofc with guild system is that players are more likely to stay in the guild cause of the achives and guild rep. But at the same time the guild might be stuck in middle of raid progressions - with some ppl taking a break or unsubing and others not geared or &quot;skilled&quot; enough to take the raids forward. This is ofc even more punishing for the 10 mans since every person is twice as valuable there as in 25 man. <br />
<br />
I know of plenty of guilds that are stuck on progression just because they dont get enough ppl on particualre night- they dont get the RIGHT classes - and still they got up to 30 ppl that want to do the content over the period of whole week... So.. guild system can become the biggest enemy of the game in this regard and Blizzard needs to be very carefull of not overtuning content for these guilds. <br />
<br />
10 mans are overtuned in both normal and heroics atm compared to 25 mans. 25 is piss easy with 3-4 &quot;Nubs&quot; in the raid.. but 10 mans are punishing for even just 1 switch - specially if some buffs are missing. <br />
<br />
My guild isn't much intrested in Heroic raids - cause we consdier ourselfs casuals. We expect normal Frielands to be balanced for normal geard group. Thats why we are ready for Firelands... More and more ppl dont bother to log in and quite a big group is playing RIFT and enjoying it very much. Our progression for the time beeing is over.</div></div><hr />

But it is following mechanics,raid awareness,not gear, that is the difference. I disagree about the casual raiding guild, as we only raid 2nights a week. And in your casual raiding guild, if you have better and good players, then you would be 12/12 unless you are carrying too many bads.<br />
<br />
To be honest I dont see where the last rank of guild you put in should have any say on raid content. if hardly raid or dont raid, then nerfing for them is pathetic at best. <br />

i should add that i myself do not get burnt out with WoW, even after five and a half years of playing. why? because i play other games as well. other MMO's, other single players, hell... i even joined a pool league last year just for some variety. variety is the key to keeping things fresh.. not only for developers, but for players as well.<br />
<br />
Well, widespread burnout just a few months after a new expansion - and one that broke records in how fast it sold - is a quite strange happening.<br />
My bet is that Blizzard upped the difficulty of heroic dungeons and raids without considering the effect the added frustration would have on the player base. I myself left the game due to the frustration of trying to tank Heroic PUGs and will only consider returning when I'm absolutely sure LFD-pugged Heroic dungeons have 95% completion rate or better in 30 minutes or less. Otherwise, I'm staying with other games.</div></div><hr />

The big problem ofc with guild system is that players are more likely to stay in the guild cause of the achives and guild rep. But at the same time the guild might be stuck in middle of raid progressions - with some ppl taking a break or unsubing and others not geared or &quot;skilled&quot; enough to take the raids forward. This is ofc even more punishing for the 10 mans since every person is twice as valuable there as in 25 man. <br />
<br />
I know of plenty of guilds that are stuck on progression just because they dont get enough ppl on particualre night- they dont get the RIGHT classes - and still they got up to 30 ppl that want to do the content over the period of whole week... So.. guild system can become the biggest enemy of the game in this regard and Blizzard needs to be very carefull of not overtuning content for these guilds. <br />
<br />
10 mans are overtuned in both normal and heroics atm compared to 25 mans. 25 is piss easy with 3-4 &quot;Nubs&quot; in the raid.. but 10 mans are punishing for even just 1 switch - specially if some buffs are missing. <br />
<br />
My guild isn't much intrested in Heroic raids - cause we consdier ourselfs casuals. We expect normal Frielands to be balanced for normal geard group. Thats why we are ready for Firelands... More and more ppl dont bother to log in and quite a big group is playing RIFT and enjoying it very much. Our progression for the time beeing is over.<br />
<br />
I agree that it is harder to recruit good players in the lower ranked guilds but if you have to teach people the fight then you are recruiting people who dont watch vids or 4months in still dont know what the hell they are doing.<br />
<br />
But tell me what good player is gonna stay in a guild that doesnt clear? A lot of people are in those guilds because they know they have no chance of raiding in a better guild. Sure some friends are helping someone out like I tried but you can only do that so long. It is amazing when you try to help people out and get nothing back but you are an elitiest. How hard is it to go to the forums here and read up on a class. Hell on my hunter all i had to do was take the priority rotation and put it in my actions bars while putting my cds together on how I should use them. 10 days later doing 18k on bh and watching the other casual hunter in the guild with a ton of gear do 13k.But again he farms for pets,achievements, and other alts for hours but wont take 10-15min to learn his class. That is the average casual that seems to be the norm. They cant take anything that isnt sugar coated and want sunshine blown up their ass about how great they are. On the other hand i did help the dk casual by telling him to come here and read the forums which helped him.<br />
<br />
They wont help themselves because they want blizzard to do it all for them. Put up power auras so we can faceroll hard,done. Take away attunements i wanna farm mounts,done. Constantly nerf enounters,even on normal mode,done.Make every class do everything so i can make any group I want because i dont think well,done.Light up the buttons I should hit on my actions bars,done.<br />

4months is more than enough time to be almost done with content and moving on. I guess I wont have to deal with it if everything keeps getting nerfed and blizzard continues with the molding of casualcraft then ill go play another mmo that will make sure to not do what blizzard is doing.<br />
<br />
BT,Sunwell, all decent difficulty raids and I dont remember as much bitching or whining as it has been since the wrath babies. At that time I thought the game was at its strongest and best, I enjoyed all the challenges of the game,attunements, and hard normal modes. Blizzard didnt buck and bend to every casual crying over content like they do now.The subscription rate was still fine and imo the game was much stronger at the time unlike now.</div></div><hr />

You realize that most casual guilds play alot more than raiders? i watch many casual guilds wipe night after night never progressing but not because of the difficulty of content but because of the way the guild is ran. When you put a 10man together you think of diversity among classes and what you will need to progress not picking people because they are your buddy. <br />
<br />
I just tried helping a friend that was actually still stuck on magmaw and after a night of wipes it was obvious that with him leading the guild would never go anywhere. Every decision is sugar coated and always worrying about hurtings someones feelings. Just like the boomkin in that guild that was doing a million less dmg on adds than the other range, he was told to aoe more and he got pissed. He went as far as to calling people elitiests because they were looking at meters trying to figure out why the adds werent dying.<br />
<br />
Blizzard makes this real easy. They will keep nerfing the game and other people will continue to leave for new mmo's that watch and see what blizzard is doing to make people quit. They will avoid that and wow will be all casual, with a few people getting on for quick clears occasionally.<br />
<br />
I think there are few things that have to be taken into consideration and thats what many of the &quot;hardcore&quot; forget. There are alot of pplt hat dont have the chance to play 3-4 hourst staight 3-4 days a week. That doesn't mean they can not play more than 10 hours - it just means they have commitments in RL that comes BEFOFRE sitting infront of a computer for X amount straight for Y days. These players are callled casual players and these players play for the fun of the game - caring about things like their friends both online and in Real Life. So.. when you actually have a player that consider real life more important or at least equally improtant then &quot;stupid&quot; things like feelings start to get in the way. And those are the ppl that BLizzard needs to deside what they want to do with. <br />
<br />
Again - The new guild system could be a real gamebreaker for alot of players atm. Cause its the casual players that actually care about their guild... while the &quot;hardcore usually wach their gear and stats - before even thinking about feelings. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hardcore&quot; community is probably the last thing WOW needs now. Still it has be what has been listened to for the past 5 years ... and its telling... <br />
<br />
&quot;I dont care about ppls feelings - Im hardcore&quot; Always makes me laugh when you watch the game enviroment - the grahpic quality and the fluffy pets that those &quot;harcores&quot; care so much about...</div></div><hr />

A optional hard mode-only raid boss will probably be seen by even less players than would see class-specific quests, and Blizzard already argues that class-specific quests would be a wasteful way to use development time when players ask for them.<br />
<br />
I, for one, when evaluating which game I'm going to be playing, take into account only things I can realistically get without depending on luck. So, when I was deciding whether to ditch WoW or not, Sinestra might as well never had existed, I regarded the bit of lore Cho'gall reveals as a glaring hole in the way Cataclysm reveals the game's lore, I didn't count on being able to run Baradin Hold, and, although I like to collect pets and mounts, any pet/mount with less than a 1% drop chance from common mobs or a 15% drop chance from bosses might as well never have existed (as I most often get bored of farming for it long before it drops).<br />
<br />
Part of the reason I'm not Playing WoW now, although a minor part - PUGs not being able to beat random heroics in 30 minutes or less was the main reason.</div></div><hr />

No, 10 man normals are not in any way over-tuned. They are easier than 25 man normals and I've done both. 10 man heroics are/were over-tuned, but they have been adjusting them (and fixing retarded bugs like adds having same health as 25 heroic). I'm 7/13 10 man heroics right now, and since we started heroics a month or so back we haven't run into a fight that isn't doable. Its taken us a lot of work on some fights to get it down, but it was never unbeatable. Of course we're just now working on H V&amp;T, so we never pulled that before the changes, and maybe the later heroic bosses are still over-tuned, but if so they'll adjust them soon I'm sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think there are few diffrent ways of looking at this. One might be that a player that isn't done with all the heroic content atm isn't really a good hardcore player playing in a good harcore guild. Cause if he was he would have done it by now...<br />
<br />
Another point would be that normal is for normal - Heroic is for hardcore. Resonable progress in normal guilds should be the most important part of the game. And what are normal guild doing these days ? 10 man content that is tuned higher than 25 mans based on the need for classes - specs and buffs. &quot;Normal&quot; in those terms is ppl realising after 2-3 weeks - siting at the PC at 19:00 ... waiting for ppl to come online that then dont come... That they are wasting their time into absolutly nothing. And why didn't ppl show up ? And why was the guild not able to go raiding with 15 ppl online with resonable good gear ... but lacking that &quot;perfect&quot; thing that is considered normal from BLizzard point of view (2 tanks 3 healers rest dps and x,y,z buffs and a,b,c this and that)....<br />
<br />
My point would be that all content should have normal mode that is fairly tuned for normal ppl . Then you have heroics that are tuned for hardcores. And THEN you have items and achivements that are ONLY available for about 3 months after the content is out. THose hardcore then have something to aim at and REALLY be able to call themselfs hardcore instead of realising that in most cases they are no better than the avrage MMO gamer that desides that there are other things that matter more to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are easier for a group that is able to show up for every raid. Thats not reality in this world tho. Thats the problem that most 20-50 ranked guilds are fighting atm and 1 person now showing up or leaving can stop the progression for 2 weeks. And then some1 else quits ... and other get bored... <br />
<br />
25 man groups have at least 1-3 backup players for each role. 10 man can not have that cause then the ppl left out are not progressing... <br />
<br />
Now the question is... should a game be tuned for skill and gear ? Or maybe they need to take into account what 1 person not showing up means for the progression of the rest?<br />
<br />
Overtuning conent is not based on just hitting few buttons. 10 mans atm are much harder to orginaise as a PROGRESSION based conent than 25 mans cause 1 dc .. 1 night off.. 1 sick night... means no progression for an entire raid group. 25 mans take this into acount. Most 10 mans do not atm. Its not like you can throw in a random member atm - or lower itemlvl alt healer.... But thats how the &quot;NORMAL&quot; shoud be balanced for. That normal thing that most normal ppl normally have in a normal raid week.<br />
<br />
HEROICS... what normal person cares about em atm? ... Most of them are stuck on progressing cause of normal things...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you - Thats why so many ppl are not happy atm since 4.1 patch is just rewamped old content. But I can not agree with you that Blizzard can not do anything to make the game more refreshing. Cause thats exactly what BLizzard failed to do with CATA. I have been playing RIFT as well and Im starting to look passed few of the things I didn't like in the start cause there are others that are just plain awsome. For example there is a real dynamic content going on that any &quot;normal&quot; person can jump into and progress his character. If they can keep that intresting and freshened up ever few months they got an awsome chance of doing something great. <br />
<br />
I absolutly ADORE the spec system atm in RIFT. I spend most my money playing around with diffrent specs and just love it. COmpare that to the stale locked down lvl 1-85 feel that WOW is putting ppl into... No way... That was huge mistake by BLizzard. <br />
<br />
What WOW needs to focus on right now IS to keep the game fresh. THey are not bringing in any new systems so the better get content out pretty regularly. And they are not doing that. Im so glad I bought RIFT cause there is a new world out there that is pretty intresting to play. Even tho I just play it for a month or two.. I will still be able to say that I enjoyed it. Defenetly more than sitting infront of my PC hoping that other 9 ppl will show up for raid on raidnights... BUt thats what GCs wants us to do....</div></div><hr />

There is no progression if you don't let pugs into raids because thats exactly what you did, in this expansion you killed pugs.<br />

Leave normal mode raids to pugs and causals.<br />

<br />
I love the raid content, its great, and some say its cheap that blizzard adds a heroic version of everything, to make content last longer, but imo thats fine as long as the fights CHANGE from the normal version.<br />
<br />
The thing I hate is the diffrence between 10 and 25 man. YES it takes more cordination to run a 25 man guild, but thats about it imo. If you loose a person on 25 man, who gives a fuck, if you loose a person on 10 man, its pretty much a wipe.<br />
<br />
10 man guilds rely a lot on their solid raiders, so if a raider quits, it can easily set the guild back 1-2 weeks. you might surgest that we recruit more, but then others will leave for not getting to raid all 3 nights, and shit like that. Also gearing up new raiders is a fucking pain in the ass. Ill give you two examples if loot in 10 man. We cleared 12/12 normals to gear up a new holy paladin. He got 1 item... Also we have killed magmaw and omnitron lootsystem 10 times on normal now, and yet there are 3 very good item upgrades from for several people that has not dropped yet.<br />
<br />
So my point is that I find 10 man raiding a really big struggle leading compared to the rewards, and compared to 25 man.<br />
<br />
p.s the 10 man heroic nerfs that will strike live servers soon are well in place in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Oh and yes, about re-using old content and boss encounters, and just making them the appropiate boss level is just SAD and PATHETIC imo. Yes I understand why naxx got thrown back into lvl 70 because about 5% of all players got to see it in vanilla. BUT onyxia, not 2 (jormungars wtf hehe) times, BUT 3 times!? are you shitting me? zul gurub + zul aman... no comments on that. On this subject I find blizard a little &quot;lazy&quot; creating NEW dungeons and environments, when they keep using old models and raid instances. I know onyxia has been around ever since wow was released, but come on... the fucking dragon is not FUN anymore, weøve seen her breath. With the budget they have, and the fact that this is probably the last expansion before blizz next MMO (correct me if im wrong, dont quote me on this!), Im expecting to see 100% AWESOME NEW raid content. and NO freaking ugly raid like TOC which was just dull and borring. I bet it took 1 designer 10 minutes to make ON A FRIDAY (we all know that you work less effeciently on a friday). I mean two worms, a demon, TWO demons, faction champions and anub, ALL already made up models. fucking make something new. Or at least just edit some models to make them DIFFRENT. but less hate on wotlk, more focus on cata, which is overall good so far. (NOT great)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ares42</div><div class="date">2011-03-18, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd expect end of May or in June sometime. That's exactly when it should be. Cata only came out in December, so coming out in June is 7 months. Blizzard has said that they plan on a 6 month schedule for new content, which is a good pace. Its not realistic to expect it faster than that, nor should they push it out faster than that. And yes, I know that June would be 7 months, but since this was the beginning of the expansion there was some time for people to level and the holidays happened right then as well, so I think that's a perfectly acceptable timeline for this content. If you really think that 6 months is too long for content then I don't know how you've been happy with anything released over the past several years - go back and look at patch dates. Ulduar was only 5 months, but that was because Naxx was so ridiculously faceroll that you could clear it in BC gear. ToC was 4 months and that was very clearly a mistake since it stopped a lot of people from finishing up Ulduar and was acknowledged as a mistake. 6 months is a good balance between giving people enough time and rushing things or taking too long (hello ICC).<br />
<br />
What you don't get is that this is heavily related to the introduction of easy/hardmode. Back in Vanilla and TBC people would spend months trying to clear content and be pretty happy about it, but once they introduced the split people cleared normal in weeks and sorta felt they were done with the content already. While people still truck away on hardmodes it just isn't the same as trying to beat a new boss, so eventhough they are &quot;progressing&quot; they still feel ready for new content. It's been a problem ever since they introduced the system and unless they completely split it, to the point where you need to pick if you are an easy or hardmode guild and you can only raid that difficulty, it will remain that way.</div></div><hr />

I think most ppl are realsing how unforginving 10 man content is atm. Loosing 1 person out of a 10 man raidgroup means you no longer have a progression for 1-2 weeks. And when ppl start to realise that... then they also realise that its really not worth doing anymore. And thats why the raid conent is overtuned atm.<br />
<br />
At this point in time most normal groups should be able to do all normal content even with 1 or 2 persons missing - filled in by an alt or even a decent pugger. Thats NORMAL. If that group has its strongest players in - they should be able to take on a heroic encounter and figure it out in 2-3 hours max (considering ilvl355+). This is not how things are atm tho. <br />
<br />
YOu can look at it any way you like. Skills is just 10% of MMORPG game. Current content is tuned for gear, spec and buffs. And it is overtuned to a degree where it is preventing ppl that are comitted to progressing.. but are not able to cause of other factors. THose ppl are not enjoying themselfs atm.</div></div><hr />

I am getting worried they are actually starting to believe in the &quot;feedback&quot; to the community themselves though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids are not too hard! There is just not a steady enough stream of new content and there is absolutely no justification given how insanely big their budget should be.<br />
<br />
Let us be honest here, hardmodes are, among many things, first and foremest an awesome way to &quot;create&quot; content without spending any money and real workforce on it which seems to be Blizzards new maxime unfortunately(not so new actually...).<br />
<br />
You just take the exact same bosses, in the exact same environments and put them into godmode.<br />
Great design from a business perspective, if your players have nothing better to do ingame for ONE WHOLE YEAR other than raid ICC week after week and the next 50 weeks.<br />
<br />
A new raid in 4.1 would be the perfect timing not despite but because people are progressing in current tier hardmodes which is not new content but really just the only content we have left to do and more like&quot;old&quot; content v1.5<br />
Dont get me wrong, I do enjoy the current raiding tier and at this moment I am still having fun progressing with my guild through it but I am fearing the worst for the future, looking at how things are shaping right now in respect to the past.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has gotten lazy, I am sorry to say it but it is the truth. I dont even blame the devs who are obviously passionate about their work to create the best game they can.<br />
It is more than likely the guy tightening the purse strings.<br />
<br />
You know, they guy saying : New content? Why? There is still so much to recycle without having to spend resources. Lets bring back ZG and ZA!<br />
<br />
I dont give a flying frack about them thanking me for buying their games in their 20 year anniversary self adulation video but I would damn well enjoy to see the appreciation reflect in the work they put into the game, which is just not happening and quite frankly I am getting fed up with it.<br />
<br />
You sound just like a ingrate, you always want more and more, yet you never actually finish what's already available, you even say it, you aren't 12/12 yet you feel you are owed new content you won't actually see for a while.</div></div><hr />

Guilds that used to casually raid 25 mans 2-3x a week now have one, maybe two 10 mans. Still leaves less room, and to be honest they just feel like complicated dungeons. At some point, WoW forgot the 'massively' part of MMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They gave up why? Is it honestly that hard people? is 10man normal content really so amazingly hard? be honest. Anyone that puts a 10man together that has common sense puts it together knowing that with 10man you make sure to bring the proper buffs. I enjoy that part of the game, knowing most classes and buffs, and maximizing the raid for the best possible progression.<br />
<br />
i think Wrath gave people the wrong direction on raiding. It was easy and heroics werent all that bad either once the group got it down. Imo wrath was very easy compared to current content and now that it isnt faceroll with pugs clearing everything like they did in Icc, people are disappointed. People that arent progressing are saying it is too hard and it is non-stop whining on wow forums and here.<br />
<br />
Isnt it about the challenge of the boss? Downing a boss that was hard after weeks of wiping? Or is lets cry and nerf the encounter until it is down to our level?<br />

Exactly.yet on my server pugs do better than alot of the casual guilds. What does that say? Is it content or just a lot of bad players in the same guilds? The baddies can console each other and talk shit about the good guilds who have no life or the elitests who have no life as they wipe and cry.<br />
<br />
The content isnt hard on normal mode,pugs are doing 7/12 while alot of casuals arent even doin that.</div></div><hr />

Well, many of them sucked with their class anyway honestly and didn't bother learning their class with proper rotation, specs, gear, enchants, gems ect. <br />
<br />
I've grouped with clever and little better geared people than my RL friends and we did clear all of BWD expect Nefarian which I didn't mind really. We were barely able to kill the 1st BOT 10 amn boss as a guild after countless wipes. Yes, I guess some people want their stuff handed to them and faceroll through the game. I spent a good 6 weeks getting my two 2H axes for my warrior and it wasn't hard. People just don't have patience anymore and that's their loss. Play Need for Speed or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like Wow even after years. But they wouldn't have to create new game, if they added empire building to Wow. For example each player can obtain hexagons of land. Then the player would need to defend the lands in land instances. You could queue up for a land instance with friends. Easier land instances could be done without full group of 5 people or could be even soloed. You would see your lands in a 3d map, where each land type has a nice hex picture of forests, deserts, islands etc... When you select one land, that opens up as a big shiny animated piece of eg. forest surrounded with the adjacent shiny lands.<br />
<br />
I would find it more interesting to defend my own land than do yet another raid or yet another hundred of random zone quests. Defending own land from mobs could still have lots of quests, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Easy solution is - make normal modes even more trivial. Make hardmodes even harder.<br />
<br />
But push new content out faster. great content that is balanced and polished and not ToC 2.0.<br />
I doubt they will make the same mistake they made with that raid again, in fact I am very excited for all the raids in the future because I expect them to be awesome. But there needs to be more of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Make hard modes harder? You have clearly not done hard modes.. the next step is pretty much next to impossible. Gear acquired from normal modes is small but crucial part of hard modes. The rest is mostly skill with a whole lot of RNG thrown in there.</div></div><hr />

probably helm and shoulder remain a drop only so even if you can buy 3 pieces with justice for the 4p bonus you need to go and kill nef or chogall.<br />
<br />
Btw I agree with gc but simply don't like the unreversible nerfing model, personally i prefer the &quot;icc buff model&quot; where is up to the guild to decide if they fight a boss at full power or nerfed.</div></div><hr />

There is no progression if you don't let pugs into raids because thats exactly what you did, in this expansion you killed pugs.<br />
<br />
Why the hell anyone wants the teamwork based endgame content to be puggable??? That sort of defeats the purpose of the game. LK raids were puggable for 2 reasons: 1) 10 man resets were not used by most raider guilds thus most people were freely available for a 10man any time 2) raids were tuned for retards (except T8).<br />
I guess we don't need 2) again. Really don't.</div></div><hr />

You realize guilds have always gone back and ran previous tier content on a regular basis right? Hell, we were running Ulduar and even Naxx at times after killing heroic Lich King.<br />

because pugging is teamwork based as well, or do you think randoms shouldn't raid? I already said hard mode is (or should be) for the cool people and guilds who want challenge and better rewards. MMO stands for &quot;Massively Multiplayer Online&quot; and not for &quot;Raids for Guilds Only&quot;.</div></div><hr />

If you want to raid go apply to a decent guild and show them what you are made of.<br />
And lemme ask a question: what is the thing that makes the difference between a random and a hardcore? A title or a mount that will be easily obtained during the next raiding pack? No thx this is LK reloaded.<br />
<br />
On topic: This would be ok as soon as no Tier piece can be obtained through Valor points or any other way besides raiding.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilderness</div><div class="date">2011-03-19, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They are easier for a group that is able to show up for every raid. Thats not reality in this world tho. Thats the problem that most 20-50 ranked guilds are fighting atm and 1 person now showing up or leaving can stop the progression for 2 weeks. And then some1 else quits ... and other get bored... <br />
<br />
25 man groups have at least 1-3 backup players for each role. 10 man can not have that cause then the ppl left out are not progressing... <br />
<br />
Now the question is... should a game be tuned for skill and gear ? Or maybe they need to take into account what 1 person not showing up means for the progression of the rest?<br />
<br />
Overtuning conent is not based on just hitting few buttons. 10 mans atm are much harder to orginaise as a PROGRESSION based conent than 25 mans cause 1 dc .. 1 night off.. 1 sick night... means no progression for an entire raid group. 25 mans take this into acount. Most 10 mans do not atm. Its not like you can throw in a random member atm - or lower itemlvl alt healer.... But thats how the &quot;NORMAL&quot; shoud be balanced for. That normal thing that most normal ppl normally have in a normal raid week.<br />
<br />
HEROICS... what normal person cares about em atm? ... Most of them are stuck on progressing cause of normal things...<br />
<br />
If you don't have more than 10 raiders as a 10 man guild than you are just doing it wrong and that is your fault, not the raid designs. You should have 12-13 raiders, which means that missing a person or even two isn't the end of the world. You just rotate in, hybrids use an off-spec, and you are good to go. Its really not that big of a deal. Yes, 25 mans have the ability to have more back-ups, since they can rotate people in more easily, but that really doesn't make 10 mans that difficult to organize.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also gearing up new raiders is a fucking pain in the ass. Ill give you two examples if loot in 10 man. We cleared 12/12 normals to gear up a new holy paladin. He got 1 item... Also we have killed magmaw and omnitron lootsystem 10 times on normal now, and yet there are 3 very good item upgrades from for several people that has not dropped yet.<br />
<br />
RNG is RNG. You don't think 25 mans don't get bad RNG with drops?<br />
<br />
<br />
What you don't get is that this is heavily related to the introduction of easy/hardmode. Back in Vanilla and TBC people would spend months trying to clear content and be pretty happy about it, but once they introduced the split people cleared normal in weeks and sorta felt they were done with the content already. While people still truck away on hardmodes it just isn't the same as trying to beat a new boss, so eventhough they are &quot;progressing&quot; they still feel ready for new content. It's been a problem ever since they introduced the system and unless they completely split it, to the point where you need to pick if you are an easy or hardmode guild and you can only raid that difficulty, it will remain that way.<br />
<br />
No, I understand normal and hardmode. And that system isn't going anywhere. There was a big problem with Vanilla and TBC raiding, particularly in Vanilla. People didn't get to see the content. People who saw Naxx at 60 were a very small percentage of the population. That's just bad game design. Blizzard has recognized that they want people to be able to see their content and tunes normal modes so that you average herp derp raider can still down it or get close in the 6 months between content. That philosophy isn't going to change and I think it works pretty well. Hard modes are for those who want a better challenge, its not new content but it doesn't need to be. If you don't like hard modes and you don't like how the system is set up then I'm sorry for you, but don't think that your opinion is the same of all those who do hard modes - I'm working my way through them now and loving it. I'd be sad to see new content yet because I want to have a shot at some of the heroic end bosses. It might be a problem for you, but I doubt it is a problem for a lot of raiders working on hard modes.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but 12/12 the game is beat, hard-modes are a bonus round, period. One additional ability does not make it a totally new encounter, nor does it enhance the lore. Thus this elitist attitude is just flat out wrong, like it or not. We do hardmodes, and while they don't feel as cool as say Ulduar HMs, they're boring, and unbalanced in 10-mans, which there are a lot more 10-man guilds running around anymore, I can see why they have said view on the matter.<br />

Firelands won't be tuned for Heroic Raid gear, thus you can gear up via normals and be &quot;ready&quot; for Firelands, sorry bro.<br />

The game is stale right now, sorry people. Non-raiding content is pretty much played out by this point. Dailies are near impossible to do anymore due to monotony. There's no new PVP stuff going on. And Raiding is beat like a rented mule as the saying goes. The game's stale.

Definitely some of the best raids this game has seen.<br />
<br />
um same mechanics killing some of the same bosses again.... whats new? stand in this----&gt; O dont stand in that-----&gt;X move from the tail Dodge this ~~~ Interrupts can be handled by one melee now for the most part.... Mages/BM hunts have Heroism now. Death knights are going to have a battle rez. Were all entitled to our opinions nothing wrong with me saying you are wrong lol but everything is being watered down even further. Not a single thing is epic about this game anymore. I only play to raid with my friends that ive been playing with over 5 years. <br />
<br />
More more more recycled content leading up to a new raid or w/e ? yay? .... Make us pvp to get better 2h weapons.... gg design team...A lot of the balance issues could have been solved years ago if they simply did (ability A does X in pve zones/content/outside arena/bgs) (ability A does X in PVP zones and arenas) Simple ? probably not but it could have been something live now if they would have got on it back &quot;in the day&quot;<br />

While I did enjoy the naxx makeover for WotLK ive not have FUN in a raid since Kara and tanking Leos demon form on my lock in SSC. <br />

Only 20% of guilds are 12/12 normal. So no, most raiders haven't beaten that yet.<br />
<br />
People too often look at Ulduar through rose-colored glasses. Yes, it was a great raid instance and the hard modes were fun. But they didn't drastically change most of the fights, they simply added a few more abilities, or were dps races. Stop pretending that they did something so different from pretty much any other instances hard modes.</div></div><hr />

That was one of the reasons I never came back to wow, come Cata they changed pretty much every class, spell, glyphs, stats. I don't understand the need to completely rework every class for each expansion. With nine eighties that is twenty seven specs to learn, stats according to each spec, rotations, enchants OH Fuck it, I don't have the time to relearn all that. It's probably my age but having to relearn all that after all the time I spent learning it so far is wasted. I have better things to do ;)<br />

I won't dispute that a lot of people like the new system, but at the same time a lot of people don't like it too. Most of them might not say it outright, but from my experience since the introduction of easy/hardmodes it's been pretty clear that quite a large amount of people just don't have the motivation to clear hardmodes.

<br />
Thats exactly what hardmodes should be about... Its for those 10% that were doing the raid content before... Most ppl now realise that its just not worth the time and effort considering that a new tier is coming... new expansion will make it all worthless so why on earth should ppl be bored to death raiding their life away ? <br />
<br />
The problem that Blizzard is faced with atm is that the game hasn't evolved in terms of raiding content for quite a long time now. PPl still hang around cause of the raids - but considering that alot of players have left in the past 2-3 weeks cause of boredom and lack of progression will cause alot of the lower end guilds to not bother. The progression was fine with Firelands coming in 1-2 months - but now its more like 3-5 and I feel alot of ppl are not interested in waiting that long.</div></div><hr />

If you want to raid go apply to a decent guild and show them what you are made of.<br />
And lemme ask a question: what is the thing that makes the difference between a random and a hardcore? A title or a mount that will be easily obtained during the next raiding pack? No thx this is LK reloaded.<br />

If random group of elites join, then the group is capable.</div></div><hr />

Sure, I've seen that happen to guilds too. But I don't agree with you that the system is at fault. You don't think guilds never broke up in Vanilla/TBC when they stalled out and couldn't progress? It absolutely happened. I actually took BC off so I can't speak to that personally, but I raided Vanilla and got to see about 1/3 of Naxx and I can tell you I saw a lot of guilds fall apart post-BWL when they weren't able to keep moving through AQ40. No matter what system you have, people who raid want to progress. When they hit a wall and are unable to move past it that leads to in-fighting, blaming, people only showing up on farm nights, etc etc. I really don't see how changing structure back to Vanilla/BC style will fix any of that.</div></div><hr />

Yes another casual too lazy to go learn their class,spec,single spec,aoe rotations. Which also leads to being too lazy to learn strats,watch videos,or read up on them. If you signed a old fat, I dont really know what old people have to do but get closer to that day.[COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]<br />

[QUOTE=mtawney1313;10796254]You realize guilds have always gone back and ran previous tier content on a regular basis right? Hell, we were running Ulduar and even Naxx at times after killing heroic Lich King.<br />

Just because you don't do it doesn't mean the rest of the wow community isn't.<br />
<br />
Ya some people went back and did BT and actually felt like it was a accomplishment. Sad in the worst way possible. It must be mental barrier they fight not clearing so lvl 70 content is their accomplishment, i guess once we hit 85 they can go back and do 12/12.<br />

The difference is that it's not about hitting a wall at all. There's just a large group of people that don't really care about hardmodes, so even if they could push through it they don't care enough to actually do it. The group is most likely a minority compared to the 2 groups that are satisfied though, so the split probably satisfies more people, however I still believe it's the reason why you see a big outcry for more content so quickly these days. As you say, people want progress, and when they finish normals in a few weeks and consider that being done, waiting for a new raid for months just doesn't cut it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More contet so quickly ? You do realise we are about the same time when 2.1 patch hit TBC. That expansion started with huge 10 man and then plenty of 25 man content. AND then they released 2.1 after 5 months and it offered another tier with problaby the greatest raid content ever in WOW. ANd you know what? THe progression felt awsome since most better guilds on the server were about to finish the earler conent. <br />
<br />
BLizzard has gotten lazy. They are releasing less and less conent and trying to force ppl to play it longer with heroic modes. Thats ok - but it should NOT prevent the real progression of the game - like its doing atm. <br />
<br />
Alot of ppl are finding it great time to leave for RIft tho... Including me and Im absolutly LOVING the leveling experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We aren't &quot;amazing&quot; players, but we aren't bad either. Most of us are world ranked either as DPS or heals, and our tank has ranked as well. That being said, this content is too demanding. I don't want to use the word &quot;hard&quot;. The concepts of the fights are not hard, they are pretty easy to understand. However, RNG and the very little room for error that we've seen with this Tier makes it stressful. Causing a lot of people to lose hope, and quit playing. <br />
<br />
I think some of the initial issues with raiding in Cata came from the combining of 10 man and 25 man. A lot of people felt 10s would be easier to do, and thus planned for 10 man raids. But quickly realized that in some instances, 10s were harder. WOTLK was great in my opinion. People were motivated to do 25s for higher level gear, and it allowed the guild leadership to take the lower skilled or under geared players in to 10 man on the weekends (or off-nights) to learn encounters, obtain gear and be evaluated. We lost that with Cata, and I can tell you, as a GM it's been frustrating in many ways.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now to answer Ghostcrawlers questions:<br />
<br />
<br />
For those of you who feel like you are stuck on progression, we’d like to hear more about why. Are you trying to PUG the encounters? Do you have a very casual guild with a lot of different players each night? <br />
<br />
We do not PUG. We have a pretty consistent group. We raid 4 nights a week, equaling about 12 hours. Cata content has forced us to up our raid schedule, as we previously raided only 3 nights a week. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is the problem that you’re undergeared or that the mechanics are too unforgiving? What are the mechanics that are really hard for raid leadership to explain or even understand? <br />
<br />
We are not undergeared. We started raiding about 2 weeks after Cata was released and quickly made it to 12/12 on 10 man. We then switched to 25 man, and are struggling with a lot of aspects. As I explained above, the mechanics seem easy enough to understand and explain. It's the little room for error and RNG that makes these encounters hard. I'll use Heroic Chimaeron as my first example: If the tank taunts a millisecond to late (due to his own error or latency etc) he automatically dies and it's a wipe. If 2-3 DPS are even slightly low, you hit enrage. If 3 people get hit with caustic slime that happen to be in the same group, 2 seconds before Massacre and the other healers aren't 100% on the ball, it's a wipe. And then, you are also dealing with, if there are more than 2 people dead and he goes into Feud...most likely the raid will take too much damage and you die. Combining all of those together, makes that fight a very tense fight on heroic. It's that way with a lot of the encounters (If 1 Blast Nova get's off in Phase 2 Nefarian it could equal a wipe, same with Hard mode halfus, etc)<br />
<br />
The mechanics are just VERY unforgiving. <br />
<br />
<br />
Are your tanks exploding, or are your healers running out of mana, or are you failing the berserk timers? <br />
<br />
Tanks getting one-shot also happens a lot more with these encounters, and we all are aware of the struggles healers are facing. I'm not saying make it WOTLK easy, but there has to be a middle line that would make it more reasonable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
which encounters you are enjoying and which ones you never want to see again<br />
<br />
I enjoy most of the encounters. Cho'gall I love. Maloriak is fun too. I really hate Atramedes as it's too difficult for those that have not so good computers or connections.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll wrap it up by saying this...<br />
<br />
We've seen a lot of World Ranked guilds (Use &lt;Cuties Only&gt; as an example), walk away from WoW due to Cata. That alone should say something to Blizzard. Especially when the specifically point out that Cata content is what caused them to do it. <br />
<br />
Quoted from their website : &quot;Cuties Only officially broke up this afternoon (3/1/2011), just like many other high-end progression raiding guilds. Tier 11 is the toughest and most grinding tier Blizzard has ever put on, which resulted in attrition and burnout. &quot;<br />
<br />
And it's true, no matter how you look at it. <br />
<br />
I think that what made WOTLK raiding successful was that the average level guilds had a chance at 11/12 hard modes, which kept them going. And the &quot;high end guilds&quot; were happy with knowing that they were the only ones that would kill Heroic Lich King and get the rare mount he dropped. It was a happy medium, that motivated everyone to keep going. <br />
<br />
Progression and staying on the top is important to raiding guilds. But with this content the Top guilds had to push so hard to get there, leaving them burnt out and done with the game, while the average level guilds like mine have no hope that we will ever get there, since the top guilds are struggling...so why bother?<br />

<br />
Have you looked at how many guilds arent struggling? How many have cleared all normal content? Not all content is meant for everyone or maybe you need to look at those dps that arent putting up the numbers they should for heroic raids. Or replace people with bad connections or undependable computers. You realize how many guilds have been 12/12 for a long time now and this is considered the normal content so it is in fact easy.<br />
<br />
You stated you are 12/12 so you have cleared normal content and heroic content is supposed to be alot harder where people really need to put up the dps,hps and tps that is needed for heroic bosses. If they nerf heroic raids then there really isnt left in the game anymore except casuals.</div></div><hr />

The developers that created the game and made it great are LONG gone.<br />
<br />
Yeah... um, no. The developers that created WoW, left to either make Hellgate:London, Guildwars, or Rift. There only a few persons left from WoW alpha, and most (probably all) have been moved over to Titan.<br />
<br />
Blizz makes 1.44 billion dollars a year now. There should be 20 BGs in this game, and a BG out every 98 days, and instead of 8 instances, Cata should have shipped with 18, adding a new one every 21 days. This game is bleeding off consumers to Rift at an alarming rate, and Swtor ain't gonna be good times for Blizz, sorry to say.<br />
<br />
GC is an #$@%, no doubt about it, and his attitude is part n parcel of why it is the game is declining. Never thought I'd say Cata was a disappointment, but it is. There is nothing do during your 3 hours a night, besides a few bgs and/or a raid that takes 90% of people months to figure out.<br />
<br />
WoW was and still is fun. I play it, but this summer, I gots me a feeling WoW's shortcoming are gonna catch up to it<br />

I am Tier 11 raid ready in a few months but the content is hard to pass from this point forward it is pretty much just wipe city for my tank with small successes now..

<br />
Blizzard lets you stomp through all content until the last piece then it is stupid unbeatable.. Top guilds in the world can beat HC Tier 11. Then you will wait for an undetermined date to pass that content unless you are a top guild with all the tools, resources and yes class/race combos as was previously stated..<br />

Is this a complaint? No man this is one of many games available to me today and this game belongs to Blizzard let them do what they will..

Just did a BoT and also did the first boss in Heroic mode. From what I have seen so far, I think that have made it challenging enough for the majority of the population. That will always be there goal. The top X percent that are done now are the ones that have time spent together raiding and all the raid team is solid and dependable. Personally if I was in one of these guild one of those guilds. I would feel a little slighted. Then again those are usually around 3-4% of the wow population. The rest do what they can. Guilds that have drama, which is by far the most of them, will always get to a certain point then then have a guild drama mama that sets them back a bit. Its a shame but its the truth. The issue of quid xp and special items only adds to the &quot;guild Issues&quot;<br />

to Firebane- It doesn't matter what game it is. If you have a game last for 6 years, people are going to get tired of it. No matter what the content is, if you are burned out, you are just burnt. Blizz can change a few things that may bring some people back but most move on to another game. The group that I played and raided with Vanilla and TBC Left the game long ago.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kardinal</div><div class="date">2011-04-02, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm tired of the Blizzard raid grind. I do like very much what was done with all the new 1-60 content, and I alpha/beta tested Cataclysm. But the raids... are raids. And yes, for now, Rift is more interesting because it is different. <br />
<br />
I find that I miss what has become comfortable over the course of six years of playing - and I miss the lore and backstory I have known for a long time. But more raid grinding gives me a headache :( <br />
<br />
So much has been changed and the developers really work hard on keeping the game interesting - and WoW dominates the market for that reason, but the grind factor is ALWAYS there. I understand that there are people who feel that they have to endure a grind in order to deserve this gear or that item, that for many players, unfortunately, the game supplies the goals that some don't have yet in life.<br />
<br />
But I do have those goals and grinds in daily life. I don't WANT them in a game; I want to have fine. <br />
<br />
Fun doesn't mean instant downing of this or that, but it does mean freedom from so many who truly believe that if you don't spent 8 hours a day player, you don't &quot;deserve&quot; the best gear.<br />
<br />
And unfortunately you folks get behind that. By making it impossible unless a person spend too many hours - hours on dailies or farming for gold and rep, hours in instances for points for basic gear; and the All Might &quot;Gearscore&quot; - which has now morphed into the even mightier PlayerScore by which YOU WILL BE JUDGED.<br />
<br />
I'm an adult, I'm *not* a guy and that, frankly, in this game already puts me several paces behind. There are those who will say &quot;We treat our chicks the same&quot; - and that makes me laugh; In six years I've not come across more than a small group of people - usually educated adults who play casually - who REALLY don't have that attitude imbedded within them.<br />
<br />
I've spent time at the top of the raid heap in a VERY SERIOUS guild where you were kicked the second time your real life impinged on your game life - i.e., you were signed up for a raid and suddenly had a family emergency. Not acceptable. &quot;Oh she had family issues.&quot; Nope, sorry, it wasn't me - but seeing others treated that way was the same thing; merely because YOU are not treated in such a way doesn't matter if someone else in the same group is; being silent and letting it happen makes you as culpable as anyone else.<br />
<br />
It's A GAME. Pixels don't imbue us with real life power. And for all the little notes about &quot;Spent time with your friends OUTSIDE Azeroth&quot; - Blizzard doesn't really want you to do that, it wants you IN the game. Look at the sheer number of lives that have been blighted by divorced, loss of jobs, failing out of school. You might say they should control themselves, but people crave the acceptance of others; we are, after all, herd animals. If you know your guild won't be happy if you aren't there, it's VERY hard to not be there for most people, especially the more impressionable (which unfortunately again, despite what many think - is them - most people).<br />
<br />
I would have liked to have seen the game become GENUINELY accessible to those who don't want to chose between family/friends/live and a game. I've been told by MANY people that 2-3 hours of play a day 5x a week is less than casual. <br />
<br />
REALLY? 15 hours a week is LESS than casual? What about 3 hours a day every day? That's 21 hours a week, a second job. That too is seen as a non-commitment.<br />
<br />
Commitment? <br />
<br />
If this is a game ONLY for children or socially maladept people who have nothing else to do - then SAY SO and be done with it. If, however, Blizzard wants to keep the subscriptions of all the players, then it should take some responsibility for the damage done by essentially requiring 6-8 hours a day in order to &quot;climb that mountain.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
As an addendum, what about new players? WHY do they have to BUY expansions they will never, ever, play? A new player to WoW has to buy three games even though they will NEVER spent 2 years in the BC zones as we did when it first came out, nor will they spend 2 years in the Wrath zones - 2 weeks at most - maybe 3? 4? to obtain the levels in those zones and then on they go. To require NEW people to pay for something - even at a &quot;discount&quot; - is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
And frankly that is another problem - because I would be spending time in the game now, but friends would rather not spend $100 to START a game - not including subscription fees. This is something that is a huge issue for the average person. &quot;Hmmm, I can start playing Rift for $40 dollars or start playing WoW for $100+ and subscription fees.&quot; Or any other game that includes prior expansions in the game that new people buy.<br />
<br />
I leave off here and don my flame retardant jammies because I'm sure the hate will flow - and frankly that is yet another issue. This game is populated by far too many angry adolescents who truly get off on attacking and flaming -- and when the worst things are said, MAYBE sit out three hours, or at the very, very worst, three days. It's a mini vacation for them to get some sleep and doesn't address the problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
For those of you in guilds comprised of real life friends and family - you're in another class, you can enjoy the game, not let it take over your lives, and have fun. But MOST of us are not in that situation, and for that reason, the burnout of grinding, of too many hours lost for essentially nothing - and all the other issues cited, Blizzard has to make some REAL changes that aren't only about tending to the &quot;top raiders&quot; but to the larger subscriber base - especially with Rift out and two more games - three - coming soon that will have a great deal of appeal for many.</div></div><hr />
