You should be able to play wow on your iPad, I know a friend of mine does (Saate) from Saate . net (sorry can't post full links yet) wow blog, just run a search on his blog for &quot;iPad&quot;. Maybe pop him an email and ask for help.</div></div><hr />

It is a game we pay to play for outstanding content, I think if someone believes the content is not to their satisfactory, that does not mean they &quot;need a life&quot;. I think people might be sick of recycled ideas blizzard constantly spits out, and their opinion is appreciated by the game developers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets put it this way, would you rather delay new content and bug fixes so that they have time to work on something original that will only be available once a year, or have a recycled idea for a seasonal thing? I'm guessing most would prefer the latter. In fact, I'm willing to bet that most people enjoy the new toy that Blizz gave them, judging by how many are flying around Orgrimmar atm. <br />
<br />
Even though most don't realize it, Cataclysm has been the largest expansion to date, I'd say even larger than the original release. Many would agree that they did a damn good job with this expansion, so while I'm not saying that person &quot;needs a life&quot;, I will say he has no right to complain about an item Blizz threw in for a seasonal event.</div></div><hr />

Agree gifts aren't something you should complain about! They are from bottom of our hearts and no matter what you get you should be thankful! Although its slightly different case here but thats irrelevant...</div></div><hr />

Sounds like someone could use some Coal next year.</div></div><hr />

They're just after churning out an enormous expansion - I'm surprised they managed to add something new to the seasonal at all! Gj Blizz imo - the zepp is good fun!</div></div><hr />

The man is paying for this game and he has the right to criticize about it, no matter if poor Blizzard has been so busy making the biggest expansion yet. He simply pointed out why he didn't like the zeppelin that much. The zeppelin, that's what he was criticizing, not the expansion, but I really don't see why he should get a grip and get a life because of doing so.<br />
<br />
In addition, he did it by using correct language and using arguements, which is something you don't see on these forums (or in internet overall) too often. Let the man not like it and tell his opinion if he wants to.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get a grip...&quot; Jeez.</div></div><hr />

Total win.</div></div><hr />
