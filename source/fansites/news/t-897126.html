Introducing the latest World of Warcraft companion up for adoption in the online Pet Store (http://us.blizzard.com/store/browse.xml?f=c:5,c:33): the wild and noble Cenarion Hatchling! This little critter is the twin of the rare Hippogryph Hatchling pet players could randomly encounter in the first World of Warcraft Trading Card Game set, Heroes of Azeroth -- and he's emerged from the forests of Azeroth to lend a helping talon to some friends in need. For every Cenarion Hatchling purchased between now and July 31, 100% of the $10 USD adoption fee will be donated to the American Red Cross's Japan Earthquake and Pacific Tsunami (https://american.redcross.org/site/Donation2?idb=0&amp;5052.donation=form1&amp;df_id=5052) relief efforts. This support will enable the Red Cross to provide shelter, food, emotional support, and other assistance to victims of this disaster.<br />

Why do people always have to be so ignorant on the boards? This is not the only time Blizzard does charity. The pandaren monk was a charity pet, the last 2 blizzcons they have had charity dinners or something where people pay shitloads of money to have dinner with them or something and get a ticket to the blizzcon and those earnings or part of it go to charity.</div></div><hr />

50%? more like 0,0001%. Like 50% of the player base use the forums.<br />
But I love how complainers/QQers find a way to justify their QQ.<br />

Didn't a blue previously announce that Blizzard was doing an in house charity thing to where they matched 100% of the donations of the staff for the Relief effort? Its nice that this has opened up to the public as a way to support and get something in return but I Wouldn't say &quot;good thing they decided to do something&quot; sounds so negative :S</div></div><hr />

Edit : 10€ / 10$ ? Really Blizz ? LOL<br />
<br />
The only reason i'm not mad about it (again and again) is because it's all for Japan, because seriously, companies need to stop pricing in Europe with the same number as in the US, it's not a small difference, i could buy 3 of these instead of two with the same money if it was the same price. And this is a small thing, imagine stuff like a game console and stuff like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It'll make blizz money, starting August 2nd.<br />
<br />
Note that I don't think any less of what they're doing...they're donating the first three months of sales to Japan, and I'm sure that'll be a significant amount.</div></div><hr />

While lives cannot be replaced, I don't think you quite understand the sheer amount of money it's going to take to rebuild what can be salvaged.<br />

Japan update:<br />
2,386 killed<br />

As a pet collector I'm a bit disappointed though to see old pet models being redistributed as &quot;new&quot; with nothing but a different name. Landro's Lil' XT, Landro's Lichling and now the Hippogryph Hatchling... the first two, okay, I can maybe see since they were originally bought online, but the Hatchling? It was a rare card from the original first set of the TCG. It's kind of a rare and special pet... or was. <br />
<br />
Would it have really been that difficult to hash out a new one? :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's still kinda sad though, how people need to get something in return before they're willing to donate. Still, the fact that they do it, shows that people still care somewhat, which is a good thing. Just wish more people would help a good cause, you know.</div></div><hr />

Like Blizzard give much for people that buy a rare card from the local store for the pet, and not the game.<br />
&quot;Blizzard cares for money lulz!&quot;<br />
Well, its likely that the store didn't bought it from Blizzard directly.</div></div><hr />

It's still kinda sad though, how people need to get something in return before they're willing to donate. Still, the fact that they do it, shows that people still care somewhat, which is a good thing. Just wish more people would help a good cause, you know.<br />

<br />
Considering the majority of the purchases will be done in the first 3 months, I don't see how it's greedy at all. I mean, I know it doesn't take a long time for them to make something like this and release, but taking no money for an item during the one time it'll sell faster than lifeboats on the Titanic... yeah, that's not greedy, that's calculated and a very nice thing of Blizzard to do. <br />
They'd still get praise if they took 25% or 50% of the sales for a limited amount of time, but this is as selfless as it gets. Sure, they'll earn something in the aftermath, but nothing compared to the amount they would've earned after the landslide just after release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact of the matter is that currency changes over time. There was a point when the US Dollar and the Euro were pretty much equal. Blizzard doesn't like to change prices however, so I don't know what you want them to do. Do you want them to raise prices in the US so that less Americans want to bother paying for it, or do you want them to lower the price in Europe so that it seems like absolutely nothing is being donated?</div></div><hr />

The TCG sells 'knock off' Blizz Store Pets.<br />
<br />
So if you aren't complaining about a Lando's Lil XT able to be bought for 3 dollars, compared to 10 from the Blizz store, you don't really have a right to complain about a ten dollar BoA item if you bought the 50$+ TCG equivalent.<br />

Did they really need to do anything else? It's just a way to reward people who want to donate to help Japan(and get them some good rep). If you're complaining that the thing you got from donating for a good cause isn't something new a shiny then I don't think you donated for the right reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is the same god damn thing. The Hatchling isn't 'Rare' it's Expensive. That's why it;s 'Rare'. Who would want to shell out from 50-500 dollars for a ONE USE ITEM. It's why I never bought it nor the other TCG items I would love, IE Savage Raptor etc. When you get down to it the Hatchling was never 'rare' because of the sake of being 'rare'. It was rare because no one who isn't wanting to burn a hole in their pocket wants to spend 50+ bucks on an item they will use on one toon and one toon only.<br />
<br />
So it is the same thing.<br />
<br />
So if no one complains about TCG loot selling knock off Blizz store pets, no one should be complaining about Blizz store selling a knock off TCG pet. Why?<br />
<br />
Because the only whining I hear is the I'm not a special snowflake anymore Blizz!!!. Who cares, there's 100+ other pets out there you can have. I've only seen one monkey in a ball. Get that.</div></div><hr />

As a pet collector I'm a bit disappointed though to see old pet models being redistributed as &quot;new&quot; with nothing but a different name. Landro's Lil' XT, Landro's Lichling and now the Hippogryph Hatchling... the first two, okay, I can maybe see since they were originally bought online, but the Hatchling? It was a rare card from the original first set of the TCG. It's kind of a rare and special pet... or was. <br />
<br />
Would it have really been that difficult to hash out a new one? :(<br />
<br />
That way, they can be sure that more ppl would buy it since it was rare :)</div></div><hr />

They are one of the richest countries on the planet, the goverment can easily borrow money to pay for the reconstruction and enjoy a little bit of extra growth due to it (ignoring that currently the economy is not doing so good)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paranitis</div><div class="date">2011-05-02, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Notarget - It is because people are inherently selfish. They want to give in order to get something back. Whether it is an object, or praise, or karma, or they are trying to get into heaven, or any other reason. They are also prone to help others in a way that SEEMS selfless, but at the same time they do it because others are feeling bad, which makes themselves feel bad, and they don't want to feel bad, so they help to feel good.<br />
<br />
Nothing people do is selfless.<br />
<br />
As for myself, I don't donate money, because I have no control over how the money is spent, but I have no problem buying food for homeless people and bringing it to them.<br />
<br />
In the case of this pet, I think it is god damn ugly, but when I get home I will buy it (if it is BoA) since it does help, and I can have evidence that I did it.</div></div><hr />

It shouldn't surprise me, but the internet community continues to get more and more disgusting by the day. Not everyone, but some of you people are just sick. Trolling or what ever, what ever your beliefs, just makes me hope karma can hold true.<br />
<br />
To all you complaining about its ugliness. Its a 100% donation, shut up and either buy it to donate or don't, its your choice. The purchase isn't so you can flaunt off the ugliness of your epeen. Its to help your fellow man.<br />
To those that wish it was the mount. Shut up. Its a freaking 100% donation. Donate if you want to or don't. Your choice. But it sounds like you have to be paid of to help out someone in need? Wow, just wow...<br />
To those that are bitching about the TCG pet. I can feel you slightly on this one, but its still a donation and for a good cause. Its also a virtual pet that can fly around you. If you made the TCG purchase, you have had it for a while now and that was your priorities. Its sorta of a bigger picture sort of thing.<br />
For those that are bitching about to give to Japan because of... umm... what, WW2? .... Please please please tell me that you are working in no more difficult a position then a janitorial one... cause otherwise you may be a danger to yourself or others around you with that mental capacity. Holy crap, you still hate Japan for something that probably didn't even happen in your life time? Way to go genius. Lets just forget about the ties Japan has with the world now and the fact they are allies and have been helping America (and other countries) for years now in trade and technology.<br />
<br />
Its for a good cause. Its a way for gamers, many of who are on a tight budget, across the world another venue of donating a small amount(Should they chose, its not like you are forced into it). You even get a reward for it, something that shouldn't even be needed. Its a gift. Even if you could go through the Red Cross before, not everyone knows the options available to them.<br />
<br />
Bloody hell, I bet if Blizzard some how pulled off the cure for cancer and then donated it free of cost to the world, people would still bitch that Blizzard did it cause they are just money hungry thieves and the the world didn't deserve it cause they were betrayed by it.<br />
<br />
Remember people. You are not required to buy it. You don't like it and you don't like helping out other people that were just struck by a horrible incident, then guess what? Move on, nothing to see here.</div></div><hr />

well i cant speak for everyone, but i said i wish it was the mount because that would be even MORE money to the cause and people would willingly pay it. heck even if they raised the price on this pet i think people would buy it to help out. i dont even play WoW atm and im buying the pet for people in my family that play WoW. anyways you can always donate directly to the Red Cross or any of the Japan Relief funds.</div></div><hr />

I currently serve as a volunteer for a non-profit organization dedicated to the Japan Tsunami &amp; Earthquake Relief Fund, and one of the organizations that we came across donating to is the American Red Cross. Although I fully support the efforts of any organization that is dedicating to aiding and supplying our friends in the Pacific, not all of the money donated to the American Red Cross goes directly to Japan. 91 cents of your dollar donated will go to helping volunteers in Japan that are aiding those conflicted with the disaster. 9 cents is the actual amount that goes to the restructuring, rebuilding, and other things Japan needs. Blizzard's move to support Japan is of course a very well-thought out and very good business strategy (brand name American Red Cross), but how much will the proceeds directly affect and impact the lives of those effected by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan? Please take that into consideration before deciding where to send your money too, thank you.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking the same thing. How can people be so callus? Yes Japan killed Americans in WWII. Yes America dropped 2 atomic bombs on Japan, But since WWII Japan has been one of Americas strongest allies. <br />

<br />
Yah, exactly. People shouldn't even need a 'reward' for donating. You do it cause its something you believe in. Not because you are getting something in return, its not really even donating in this case. Blizzard is actually the one donating. People buying this pet are just making another purchase. But it is a avenue for a good cause so I personaly believe its cool Blizz set it up to give people the opportunity to donate in another way. And yah, I see your point. But some of the comments in this thread show just how much some people can think past themselves.<br />
<br />
Its pretty glaring the amount of people that are so ignorant or self centered. There is no requirement to buy the pet. There is nothing that says you have to spend your money. But some of these punks actually have a negative stance on the issue. If its not your thing, thats fine, move on! But in no way is there a reason for the complaining about the appearance of the pet, the money spent on the pet, the fact Blizzard released the pet for a charity effort, or that they are donating to help Japan. <br />
<br />
It's like people just like to put their ass-holery on display to show it off to the rest of us on just how pathetic they are.</div></div><hr />

If you're going to be such a selfish jerk why do you care about charity at all? If you havn't noticed, it's being sold in more places then just the self centered US. This time it's not even a scam to work off peoples emotions for blizzard to make a quick buck either so theres nothing moral to even complain about. For once they are actually doing a selfless act (they made profit before, that wasn't selfless) and you whine about your greedy self.<br />

I hope thats not the case, because that would ensure that blizzard is roping in idiots with the nice guy facade only to gouge them later. So many stupid people will fall for it too<br />
&quot;duhhhhh blizzard donated a fraction to charity in the past therefore it's a great idea that I pay a ridiculous price for a single vanity item, it's optional so i'm not stupid, duhhhhhhhhhh&quot; **** THIS is the case if the mount goes to 100% profits for blizzard (or even 50%), NOT FOR THE HATCHLING PET THEY ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING ON.<br />
<br />
in short: 100% to charity, good, no problems<br />
if they go back to 50% on the mount: They are just roping in idiots and are not being a selfless or good company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, I don't mean to start a debate here, but I really feel it necessary to address this misconception. <br />
<br />
The bombings that ended WWII does not magically negate the events of Pearl Harbor. <br />
<br />
The dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was done to end a war and avoid countless millions more casualties on both sides if America had been forced to wage a full scale invasion of Japan. The approximately 200,000 deaths as a result of the bombings pale in comparison to the lower end of the estimates of deaths as a result of aforementioned invasion. There would likely have been well over 200,000 civilian deaths anyways, and many many more military deaths. The bombings resulted in a swift end to the war, Japan should be thankful to the United States for that in face of what the alternative would've been, a long drawn out defeat with many more deaths on both sides.<br />
<br />
In summation, the attack on Pearl Harbor were mostly unprovoked and dragged America into the war, finally. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were done to bring a swift end to a war that Japan instigated with the United States. The latter does not negate the former.<br />

Now, about the pet, I must say that this was quite the surprise. It seems as a result the lion mount will not go to charity, but this is a good alternative. Personally, I feel the pet looks quite silly. I hope the funds raised are numerous in quantity and put to good use over in Japan.</div></div><hr />

They knew plenty of kids would /cry when the lion mount was released without proceeds going to japan. So they released this rehash as a &quot;shut the f- up&quot; when the lion comes out with full profits going to Blizzard :). I'm very happy with this decision, was afraid the japan factor would make more players choose to purchase the lion.<br />
<br />
So do you think it's a good thing that thousands of morons will waste their money on that mount when none of it's almost 100% profit will go to charity? Plenty of intelligent people will still /cry when blizzard tricks a bunch of morons to spend a lot of money on the same thing they release plenty of for a normal monthly payment. A pet finally being sold with 100% to charity wont make up for a greedy, more expensive, mount being overpriced for another way for them to add another drop in their money pile.</div></div><hr />

ummmm education, rent, actual food or even just things that are worth the whole $25 (assuming thats what the mount will sell for). Nice ignorant choice of something you must think everyone wastes money on. Even if it was true I wasted money on junk food/fast food, it's still infinitely more useful then a vanity item in a game because of it's minuscule nutrition value and the fact that if it was my only choice it could let me live for another day. You have to be a fool to think buying anything at the pet store (except this one pet that is actually 100% for charity) has any real value over ANY physical object or something that is usually given away in a package deal (monthly payments) but is sold separately for an insane mark-up (further made useless that it is a vanity object in a game that you won't use in no time).<br />
<br />
Even if taken to both be equally useless, a lot more work/materials go into making a Big Mac and it still sells for less then a programmed vanity item.</div></div><hr />

Your generalization of anyone who purchases the mount as &quot;morons&quot; was easily the most ignorant thing said on this topic. Any object or service's &quot;usefulness&quot; depends on the individual. For example, your choice to purchase a subscription to WoW would be considered a &quot;moronic waste&quot; by many people on this planet. <br />
<br />
That's aside from my original point, though. I just find it ridiculous that often on these forums people have the audacity to demand how blizzard spend their money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are alot of people in the world which is alot worse of than the people of japan. Would be better to give the $ directly to an organisation like save the children, the red cross or doctors whitout borders, and let them chose were to spend the cash.<br />
<br />
Its a big thing which has happend, but realy, there are better things to do than helping a country who has asked us to stop helping them.. <br />
<br />
Basically what you do when you buy this pet, is helping the american red cross to earn back the monny they wasted, when they buildt the shelters in California and Hawaii when there were warnings that a tsunami might hit there. Thats the only reason they are still collecting, to get their 9% profit...</div></div><hr />

Blizzard already gave Money to help japan a long time ago. Get your facts straight before making statements.<br />

<br />
The bombings that ended WWII does not magically negate the events of Pearl Harbor. <br />
<br />
The dropping of the atom bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was done to end a war and avoid countless millions more casualties on both sides if America had been forced to wage a full scale invasion of Japan. The approximately 200,000 deaths as a result of the bombings pale in comparison to the lower end of the estimates of deaths as a result of aforementioned invasion. There would likely have been well over 200,000 civilian deaths anyways, and many many more military deaths. The bombings resulted in a swift end to the war, Japan should be thankful to the United States for that in face of what the alternative would've been, a long drawn out defeat with many more deaths on both sides.<br />

In summation, the attack on Pearl Harbor were mostly unprovoked and dragged America into the war, finally. The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were done to bring a swift end to a war that Japan instigated with the United States. The latter does not negate the former.<br />

<br />
Oh My God. Really ? I belive the japanese people rather lost in &quot;honourable&quot; fight to end then burning and get radiated for generations. And stop believing in your fox news education. It is a well known fact, for the rest of the world, that the attack on Pearl Harbour WAS provoked by the U.S. government to give their people a reason to join the WW2. Hence why the best and modern vessels of the navy weren't in PH when the attack started. They had knowledge about the attack plans.<br />
<br />
BTT: Id rather buy the winged Lion as a charity pet than this, ... well ..., ugly pet. But when I don't like this pet I can donate in other ways.</div></div><hr />

I didn't gloat, and those two bombs were to save many more lives and years of island hopping in the Pacific, if you think otherwise you are insane and very uneducated.<br />
<br />
I'm simply saying that an American company, and citizens has no buisiness giving money to a treacherous bunch, who have plenty of money in the first place.<br />
<br />
As for retarded,... they build a fucking nuclear reactor on an active volcano, in an earthquake zone, that gets hit by tsunamis, and now affected the rest of the PLANET by doing so. <br />
