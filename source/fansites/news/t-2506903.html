Barron's - Activision Stock Potential Price Increase<br />
Reuters recently (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-activision-stocks/world-of-warcraft-nostalgia-to-boost-activision-blizzard-barrons-idUSKCN1VM1LK) cited a Barron's report that pointed to a potential stock price growth due the positive reception of World of Warcraft classic. Classic set a set a record for launch-day concurrent viewers on Twitch. <br />
<br />
<br />
Barron’s cited reports of hours-long wait times to log into the game, and quoted Blizzard Entertainment, a subsidiary of Activision, as saying World of Warcraft Classic set a record for launch-day concurrent viewers on Twitch, a platform which hosts live-streams of gamers playing which people can watch.<br />
<br />
“The business model for World of Warcraft is highly profitable, with a subscription costing $15 a month. If World of Warcraft Classic drives a couple million new subscribers for a few quarters, it would boost the company’s earnings significantly,” Barron’s said.</div></div><hr />

Activision's stock goes up/down all the time, corresponding with WoW patch/expansion releases. No report on those. Classic comes out. Stock goes up (a negligible amount, btw). It's reported front page. Anyone else notice this? I mean, I love Classic and am non-stop playing it, but we should be objective here.</div></div><hr />

Lmao they're way overestimating how many people will play classic for 9 months. Clueless &quot;financial analysts&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also knew it would be a good for Blizzard in the end. Now that most of the work on it is complete, they don't have to do much of anything, for that investment to just keep bringing in free money for them. And unlike the live game, they'll not have to generate new content for it. It's very financially lucrative.<br />
<br />
I just hope this will end up bringing the player more benefits too. More money that Blizz is willing to pump into WoW, hopefully. I hope so, because Classic will also draw players out of retail. So retail needs a lot more love.<br />
<br />
More server mergers for small realms like mine is some love I would enjoy Blizzard, if you're taking requests.</div></div><hr />

What the Classic haters fail to understand is that Classic has been a boon to Blizzard. This report from Barren's and the rise in stock price is a huge win for Blizzard. Classic has brought a lot of positive attention both to Blizzard and the franchise of WoW, again. That ultimately will benefit Retail in one of two ways: 1) Blizzard earning more will allow them to devote more resources to Retail since Classic has limited on-going costs 2) some portion of returning players and/or new players attracted by all the buzz may well dabble in or try Retail. <br />
<br />
What Retailers / haters should do, instead of their non-stop whining, is be happy that Classic is a success and understand that they are the ultimate beneficiaries of the success of Classic.</div></div><hr />

Just because someone points out that classic does indeed already lose interest to a bunch of people doesnt make em instantly a &quot;retailer classic hater&quot;.<br />

Youre delusional if you truely belive the numbers of active people on classic will even stay remotely to what they are the first week.</div></div><hr />

pretty much every dungeon (there are some exeptions) could be run in a at max 10 man raid. ofc that means quests did not work if not marked as raid quests.</div></div><hr />

You're also delusional if you think whiny BFA fans quitting after a few hours because of graphics or difficult quests is representative of the HUGE amount of players who wanted Classic in the first place.<br />
<br />
It wasn't made for the BFA fanboys who enjoy having rewards handed to them with minimal effort, and those players are a tiny minority in WoW's huge playerbase history. I TRULY BELIEVE that, regardless of what you truely belive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have absolutely no delusions about the fact that the Classic population will decline. I fully expect it too. Blizzard fully expects it too as does this report from Baron's (in 6 - 9 months). I also have no delusions about the intent behind the comment I referenced. <br />
<br />
But you're completely missing the point. Retailers ultimately benefit from the success of Classic and if they could simply get that truth through their thick heads instead of always negatively commenting on the game and starting troll threads etc they should embrace Classic (not play it necessarily) and all the attention it has brought back to the franchise they are so invested in as they will ultimately benefit from it. But it seems that's to much too ask.<br />

Classic success means good news for retailers, because that way they can invest more in future patches. Also this success could lead to TBC and WotLK, expansions that I would REALLY play them. My problem with classic people is that they praise vanilla like it's the second coming of Christ, when it's clear as day it's trash. Ok, I get the slow leveling, but look at the raids...bosses one shotted by people with leveling gear, some of them being under 60, or Onyxia being killed with less than 40 people on 2nd try. And then you compete for 2 items/boss. What a fucking joke.</div></div><hr />

Interesting. It appears to be another gaffe with an internal miscommunication across language-barriers resulting in info not meant to be shared yet with the consumers. I don't know how newsworthy it is when something like what it suggests was in due time inevitable given their cross-polinating policy to keep players under their own umbrella of games. They won't lose much as by then bfa will be dated anyway, instead they'll win by helping maintain subs this way.</div></div><hr />

Black Rock Spire was 15 man and scholo / strat and BRD were 10 man on launch. This changed in patch 1.10.0 when BRS went to 10 man and the other 3 went to 5 man<br />
<br />
<br />
High-Level Instance Changes<br />
Along with the new Armor Sets, the high-level 5-10 man dungeons have received some changes regarding loot. Many items have been improved in quality and use. In addition, several epic items, such as Headmaster's Charge and the Runeblade of Baron Rivendare, have had their drop rates significantly increased. In order to preserve the challenge of these dungeons, they have had their instance caps lowered. Stratholme, Scholomance, and Blackrock Depths now allow a maximum of five players inside, and Blackrock Spire allows a maximum of ten.<br />

My thoughts exactly, I am playing both BFA and Classic and switched to Classic because BFA is absolutely boring and stale atm, I have all essences on lvl 3, ilvl 443 and cleared all m+ at least 10 or higher as well as heroic raid. There is nothing going on in BFA, classic is a fresh breath of air and will occupy me until a new patch arrives on BFA.</div></div><hr />

We didn't have real news even before Classic went live, which happened a couple days ago. BfA is almost 13 months old but we still had news on a daily basis. I don't understand why we can't keep the same trend and focus on Retail, giving Classic its own section.</div></div><hr />

They know where their bread is buttered so to speak. Classic wow is all the wow anyone wants to talk about, in the media, etc. <br />
<br />
It’s a cultural phenomenon in round 2 as well. <br />
<br />
Why wouldn’t they cover wow classic on a wow site? This site doesn’t say bfa only and fact is there isn’t much to report for bfa atm. Just wait til patch info leaks out but I’d go ahead and accept that this site, wowhead, and others will be classic centric for a while</div></div><hr />

Now they're mixing Classing and Retail which is annoying for those who don't even play Classic. It's a different game with different... everything. If BfA is old (and it is, I agree with you) then why not adding some Diablo , HOTS and other games news too to make it more spicy?<br />
<br />
We've got no news for Retail since August 27th (Classic launch). Before that day we had Retail stuff every single day, even multiple times per day sometimes. I know the game is old but that doesn't mean we stopped caring about it. There has always been something to read about and it was nice. Now it's just Classic and it's done.<br />
<br />
My point is that Classic and Retail have a different kind of audience. I think it would be nice to let Retail fans have a filter to keep reading about Retail instead of reading repetitive news about a game not everyone may care about.</div></div><hr />

Hotfixes are still getting posted, but Blizzard is putting all their focus into Classic for launch week. Come back at the end of September for BFA news. In a drought atm. They want crossover between the two games. Blizzard didn't hire new CMs for Classic either to pass news along. I think the end of September will be the next Dev Q&amp;A or Feature Presentation with Muffinus</div></div><hr />

The NASDAQ has had gains of 3.02% for the last 5 business days. Stands to reason Activision/Blizzards would get a bump as well. With Overwatch, Diablo, and positive reviews of Call of Duty (which sounds more likely why the stock rose last week). <br />
<br />
We will see what impact Classic has had on the quarterly earnings report for this quarter, that is what is going to matter, not Barron's speculations how the stock is performing better as the result of Classic launch. Though if it turns out that Classic indeed had an impact, then that is not only good for the company, employees, and stockholders. It is also good for each one of their franchises as well. <br />

I think you need friends for classic to be fun. It’s been a blast for me and all my buds. We have a group of about ten of us that all work together and help gear each other up. You should deff keep playing retail because you clearly enjoy it more. And definitely keep sending us those baddies because we love helping all the noobs that actually enjoy the game!</div></div><hr />

NO.. That would ruin the economy and create inflation. Play retail if you want free game time. You can easily get several thousand gold just from raid spamming older raids. Then play the AH.</div></div><hr />

I am sure quite a few are new subs, but busines wise its basically just a short term cash grab by Blizz because at the end of the day 'Classic' does have an end. its not and never going to be a on going project, most Players I'm sure will quit once they played through it once, and that's just those that stick it out to the end, sure there will be those hardcore Classic fans that stay but it won't be many, no matter how 'good' a game is it gets a bit boring after multiple playthroughs. <br />
<br />
Classics only been live a week and quite a lot have already completed everything currently available already, there will ofc be further patch updates, but I can guarantee those will be strategically released around the Activision quarterly reports , its just gated cash grabs but eventually it will come to an end, we all know that. One thing for sure they are going to Milk the Classic Hype as much as they possibly can..........its business and its showing results its making money thats ALL they care about</div></div><hr />

<br />
a lot of it is &quot;new&quot; money and some of it is &quot;longer&quot; money (i.e. retail subs that would've otherwise unsubscribed during the latest retail lull that kept their subscription going instead to play Classic)...no one knows the exact combo but from Blizzards perspective it's padding their profits substantially more than if Classic wouldn't have been released, it's upping their MAU dramatically and bolstering their share price all of which are great for Blizzard and potentially will benefit Retail since Classic has minimum on going costs. <br />
<br />
Additionally, all kinds of people like myself resubbed solely for Classic. How solely you may ask? Well, I subscribed just before name reservation and between then and the launch of Classic spent a total of 5 mins in BFA, sending all my gold to one toon for future Token purchases, and that's despite having a max lvl toon able to do current content.<br />
<br />
You couldn't pay me to play Retail though I'm happy to pay Blizzard for the opportunity to play Classic and don't mind that my sub fee is partially supporting Retail because I'm happy to have a version of the game I like and glad you have a version you like. Too bad the Retail haters of Classic couldn't see it that way.<br />

People are already seeing the lies the vanilla zealots have been spewing for months...it isn't hard...both raids cleared in under a week. This is only week one...released in a slow period for retail.<br />
<br />
It's getting boring reading your constant attacks on Classic at every opportunity you get...you haven't gotten bored of it yet eh?<br />
<br />
No one was lying. And the raids get progressively more difficult, mechanics wise and gear check wise, later in the cycle of Vanilla. Ony and MC were the easiest Raids in Vanilla. No one ever said anything different. There are also entire elements of Classic that are harder than their counterparts in Retail where you have to fall asleep at your keyboard to die while levelling or doing LFR for instance.<br />
<br />
But you can also lie by omission and you do that often. Equating what was done by the top private server guild in the world to a boss/raid that was substantially nerfed as a result of it being attempted with Patch 1.12 itemization adjustments, nerfs, double the debuff slots, years of practise, add-ons and communication tools not available originally and an exp bug exploit with the original 1.3 patch version of the raid just proves you're quite content to ignore any evidence to the contrary in your ongoing crusade to trash Classic.<br />
<br />
Please grow up and realize that Classic has been a boon to Blizzard and the franchise. My sub is subsidizing the version of the game you prefer. There's excitement and energy around the franchise again. Some people coming back or new players attracted to Wow as a result may try Retail. Blizzards profits are up. Classic has minimal ongoing costs so they may spend more money on Retail development.<br />
<br />
If you could just stop being the bitter little whiny malcontent that your posts demonstrate you are and stop biting off your nose to spite your face you'd realize that Classic's success will ultimately benefit retail. Once you get that through your thick skull you'd realize that instead of constantly crapping on Classic you should be wishing it to succeed and embrace it because Retail will be better off in the long run if you did. Of course it takes a mature individual to be able to see that.</div></div><hr />

Out of a guild of 20-25 players, only 5 that I know of still had a sub when Classic launched. One I know of hasn't played since early TBC. Couple of others have only been on since Wrath sporadically. Heck we even have a new player who has never played WoW at all.<br />
<br />
Trying to pigeonhole who is or isn't playing at this point is silly because from my perspective they are coming from all different angles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been playing since vanilla and I've gotta say, 'minimal' effort? <br />
<br />
Top raid content is at least 100x harder than classic raid content, did you not just see Apes clear MC with people not even at the level cap? Try clearing Firelands/Ragnaros on heroic without people geared or at the level cap. Honestly vanilla bosses are loot pinatas, 2 mechanic, tank and spanks that spit out loot, DPS specs spam one button rotations to do top damage. Pretty 'hard'. <br />
<br />
Loot aisde, cutting edge is the pinnacle of rewards, not loot - that's just means to an end. You do not get cutting edge achievements with 'minimal' effort. Unless you're carried.<br />
<br />
So let's not get into comparisons.<br />
<br />
I work pretty hard for my rewards thank you very much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are a moron. Bugs are not intended.. It wasnt in vanilla, and was not supposed to be in at launch. The issue here is that they had a whole beta period and they didnt catch it to fix on time.<br />
<br />
It was a design change back in 2004 after realizing players were abusing raid exp mechanics in dungeons. The bug was forgetting to carry over that change to classic WoW because they wanted the most authentic experience. <br />
<br />
Just like changing how hunter pets would automatically summon themselves after dismounting or landing at a flight path. That was a design change. Then suddenly that stopped working in a later patch so it was now a bugfix.</div></div><hr />

Community between vanilla and retail has not changed, not one bit. Vanilla guilds forced you to raid a certain spec and sat you if you didn't perform, same can be said today, all depends on the people, not the game.</div></div><hr />

Simply not likely. <br />
<br />
Classic can draw current Live players, sure, but to think it didn't pull any new people back is just... well, it's void of any sort of logic, considering Classic was literally demanded by players no longer enjoying the live game.<br />

<br />
Depends entirely on what you surround yourself with. Applying to a guild that has a more social goal in the game and won't tolerate drama, for example. BfA's community is not some monolith, neither is Classic's. <br />
<br />
Thinking it's some weird magical veil being drawn over people's minds upon entering Classic sort of rhymes badly with the toxicity seen in general chats alone. Strangers are still strangers, players of 2019 are what they are.</div></div><hr />

A facebook post from the Brazilian WoW page. Most likely a mistake from the guy who made the post. It was quickly removed.<br />

I say it's an error because Blizzard said they don't want to do cross-game rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I work pretty hard for my rewards thank you very much.<br />
<br />
the problem with your comparison is that your not comparing Apples to Apples.<br />
<br />
First, yes the top private server guild in the world who have basically had 15 years of practise and access to add-ons not available when these 2 raids were first launched were able to rolf stomp the 2 easiest raids in Vanilla/Classic that had no dps checks / rage timers. Of course, they also benefitted from the fact they were doing the 1.12 version and not the original version of the raid and benefitted from nerfs to the raids, better itemization, an exp bug that allowed them to get there faster and, oh yeah, they totally cheesed most of it by using a quasi-exploit world buff that gave them 225 fire resistance totally nullifying the need for FR gear/potions etc etc.<br />
<br />
Second, there was only one level of difficulty in Vanilla / Classic raids and that difficulty level increased with each new raid in Vanilla. The top Retail guilds rolf stomp Normal and heroic versions of Retail raids in about the same amount of time these 2 raids were rolf stomped. Mythic raiding is definitely harder than anything in Vanilla / Classic but even that doesn't present much of a challenge to the top guilds in the World who usually have few issues with the first few bosses even in the mythic raids. And from a participation perspective mythic raiding in Retail is on par with participation levels of the later single level difficulty but more challenging raids in late Vanilla / Classic (AQ40 and Naxx).<br />
<br />
So, you're right we shouldn't make comparisons and false analogies.</div></div><hr />

Barron - citation needed. Although a true Nostradamus never underestimates petty gam(bl)ers or fools with money. It'll be interesting to see where the museum piece is at by the end of the year or its effect on the next quarterly..<br />
<br />
Maybe it was intentional? This definitely was a bug, it was extremely efficient leveling by far compared to any other method, this never happened in classic. I suppose two weeks isn't really a huge window of error for a fix though? Some people got lucky for sure, but Blizzard has a good track record of banning those who take advantage of exploits, not a single ban has gone out that I've heard of yet, awfully suspicious.<br />
<br />
Thing is a lot of folks here didn't play classic, they assume this was a feature and the Blizzard shut it off because they didn't like it. This wasn't a feature in 1.12. Lot of misunderstanding going on.</div></div><hr />
