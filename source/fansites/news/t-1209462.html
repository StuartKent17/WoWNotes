Probably because blizzard stopped designing high quality pets that you can get in game the second the pet store went live. If they offered different pets in game of similar quality that you could get in the actual game then it probably wouldn't upset so many people. And all that was before pets had any actual affect on gameplay, now that you can actually battle with them(and store pets are stronger) then people tend to have even more issue with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;high quality pets?&quot; Almost ALL pets were reskins of already existing critters, or just ports of existing creatures prior to the pet store. And even before the pet store, most of the &quot;unique models&quot; were relegated to the TCG, which had players paying out the wazoo for anyway.<br />
<br />
Don't pretend otherwise.</div></div><hr />

Store pets are stronger? Well now that you've made a comparative statement: stronger than what? 'Cause I've beaten my fair share (perhaps my unfair share) of store-bought pets with my ingame-only pets.</div></div><hr />

Store pets and achievement pets and some hard to get pets are all considered rare. They are no stronger than a rare quality pet you can catch</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah sorry didn't flesh that out enough. They are stronger than normal pets and on probably on par with rares. Note that is just what I have read because I don't do pet battles so take it with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
As far as high quality goes, the pheonix hatchling is the last high quality pet released that I can remember pre pet store. The game has been increasing in quality steadily since release everywhere from pet models, mount models, gear models, areas etc... Yes vanilla pets were low quality but everything was low quality in vanilla by todays standards. While pet quality has gone up with the rest of the game, that only applies to pets acquired via the pet store. It doesn't bother me terribly, but it is fairly obvious to see why it bothers other people.</div></div><hr />

First they said 'Adoption details coming soon' if it were a 'mail to all toons who log in this week' i doubt they would word it as adoption. More then likely it will be pet store bought. They have also said before they did not want to get in the habit of handing out pets for things like random anniversaries(other then milestone years, like 5-10-...), doubt i could find the blue post about it cause its a few years old now, though im sure a few other people remember it.<br />
<br />
99% chance it will be pet store.<br />
.5% chance it will be anniversary<br />
.5% chance its something else no one has thought of, perhaps comes with some other merchandise, some 'real life' store deal, maybe even something with the megablocks, who knows. <br />
<br />
of course now that ive said this, its 100% chance it will be for the anniversary just so i have to eat my own words, yay me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Recent unique and non pet-store pets include Crawling Claw, the celestial dragon, the fossilized Raptor hatchling, the argent squire/grunt, Creepy Crate, Corehound pup, De-weaponized mechanical companion... I could go on. None of which required the pet store.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm a mount collector. I have every pre-3.1 raid/dungeon drop mount in the game, save for the old amani warbear and grand black war mammoth. I've bought a total of ONE store mount, and that was the sparkle pony when it first came out. I in no way feel obligated to purchase any of the others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jbombard</div><div class="date">2012-10-11, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recent unique and non pet-store pets include Crawling Claw, the celestial dragon, the fossilized Raptor hatchling, the argent squire/grunt, Creepy Crate, Corehound pup, De-weaponized mechanical companion... I could go on. None of which required the pet store.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm a mount collector. I have every pre-3.1 raid/dungeon drop mount in the game, save for the old amani warbear and grand black war mammoth. I've bought a total of ONE store mount, and that was the sparkle pony when it first came out. I in no way feel obligated to purchase any of the others.<br />
<br />
I used to be a pet collector pre pet store, but it seemed silly post pet store so I stopped. Going through that list, some of those aren't pets you can get in game, others are standard in game models, which is great but it isn't pet store quality. Actually creepy crate is one of my favorite pets. Like I said personally I don't mind, I think the pet store allows for some great gifts to friends/family who play wow. However it does make me sad that they don't seem to be putting new pets in the game of *equal* quality that can be acquired through raids/dungeons/super rare drops. <br />
<br />
All my previous statement was intended to do was answer the question somebody asked about why it bothers some people, I'm not saying I am one of those people.</div></div><hr />

Of course... according to Forum opinion, WoW artists work on pet battle scripting, Raid encounters, daily quests, Diablo 3, are actively programming Titan, write the April fool's day jokes, and probably massage the Blizzard executives in their down time. Apparently they have a very full workload. But yet still manage to be lazy and underutilized.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you're striking an appropriate tone. When someone uses the word 'sheeple', that means they are discriminating individuals whose critical faculties are well above normal... they should be deferred to in all matters of taste. Or ignored. I forget which.</div></div><hr />

Special offer for you:<br />
<br />
In stead of the regular $10, you can pay $20!!!<br />
<br />
$10 to get the pet and the other $10 you wire to your favorite charity!<br />
<br />
Ow wait, you mean, you want stuff for the same price, but only Blizzard has to part with some of their money for charity, while you get the same stuff and the 'bragging' rights of 'doing something good'?</div></div><hr />

It's not likely to be TCG as they have just released the Timewalkers: War of the Anceints at the start of October and it would be too long a wait to have it in the next one, I'd think it a bit early to be advertising it if that were the case.<br />

looks like natsu from reborn<br />
<br />
this makes me sick<br />
It is exactly what is wrong with the community these days.<br />
<br />
How about putting some effort into it ? <br />
Making it a rep reward, a pvp reward, meta reward, quests reward, drop chance etc ?!...<br />
Why (more) real money....</div></div><hr />

They REALLY can't make the argument of &quot;we're not selling things for money that directly effect gameplay&quot; any more with pet battles.<br />

it's funny how nobody cares about all that heroic progress, and everyone comment on new pet :D<br />
<br />
Keeping an eye on high-end guilds racing to world firsts is a joke now with how quickly they zerg through it, it's actually more surprising that they're brining a new cash shop pet so close after an expansion release.</div></div><hr />

This first raid is more of a tutorial anyway. You've all seen the loot ilvl too compared to rest of the raids.</div></div><hr />

Only 25 men counts!<br />
<br />
Tier 11 Heroics want a word with you :)<br />
<br />
But seriously, can we just stop this &quot;25 man is harder so it's the only one that counts&quot; and &quot;10 man is easy mode&quot;. At the end of the day, they each have their own problems that make things more difficult. For 25 man it's the organisation and certain mechanics that make the difficulty. For 10 man it's the raid composition having to be perfect and certain other mechanics that make the difficulty. For example, 10 Mans have less difficulty staying away from each other when there are chain lightning or splash damage type effects. 25 Mans have an easier time causing the chains (considering that the boss arena's seem to be same size for 10/25 mans). I'm not denying that 25 mans are more difficult overall, because I kind of agree with that, but please stop treating 10 and 25 mans as the same thing, they're different and in all honesty should have different progression ladders and achievements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ur dumb or what? 10 man is harder, only think about 25 man hard is to manage everything but to kill stuff is easier. Even the ladder shows it. If 10 man would be easier then why only 4 10man guilds are in the top 25 ? You wont tell me that there are more 25 man HARDCORE guilds than 10 man cuz thats not true.</div></div><hr />

Remember when even classic race bosses had unique models? Pepridge farm remembers. <br />

Spirit binder looks a whole lot like my mogged priest while on super bloodlust and a growth pot. they could have at least used the new (if you can call it that) troll models from wrath, or even some other version of trolls, like the new tauren.</div></div><hr />
