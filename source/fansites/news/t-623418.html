It's been less than 24 hours since the expansion went live. Even without a break, making ten levels in under 24 hours is... well, it's mind boggling. I expect most people will take ~50 hours of playtime to get to 80.<br />
<br />
Now he has to wait for other people to catch up to do content. :p<br />

Edit: Grats to the player. Armory still shows them as 70 for some reason, so my guess is they haven't even logged out since starting their epic zerg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, since what he did takes more then one day. It's hell alot of planning, farming mats, getting up quest routes or w/e he did and he most likely played in the beta (= know where to be and when).<br />
<br />
But anyhow, congratz Nymh, a well deserved achievement!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly, now he can go back to life. He spent less time on leveling then most people will, how does that make him a no-lifer?<br />
<br />
I will probably have a couple of days /played from 70-80 myself, but if i could do what he did, i would, saves alot of time :)</div></div><hr />

So, okay, that guy powerleveled to 80 in about a day for showing off the title...<br />
Ignoring that he won't be able to do much designed for his level...<br />
<br />
Northrend is such a nicely designed area, why spoiler the game for one by rushing through it?<br />

so what are you saying ? he will be uninstalling the game now ? My point is he's prolly gonna get 2 more alts through the same content again.The game is there you can always enjoy it after you made your acomplishment.<br />

Hi there people flaming him for having no life!<br />
He just used 1 day for getting from 70 to 80. It will Take you alot more days. Therefor he has alot of free time that he can spend with his friends and family while you are trying to get 80 in some weeks!<br />
<br />
tl;dr He has more life than the rest of us :&lt;</div></div><hr />

I learned that people who do such a thing aren't playing to enjoy, but do it because they are what is called attention-whores.<br />
Look at 'uber-leet' raidguilds who make their member play up to 24/7 and insist that they play at least 18 hours a day at weekends...(that is NO joke) they don't play because they like the game and enjoy it. They just do it so people will be stupid enough to congratulate them because they gave up their life outside the game to kill a virtual monster before anyone else could.<br />
And that is really poor.<br />
I know some are up to call me hypocrite as I'm playing and enjoying the game myself, but seriously people:<br />
<br />
It's a huge difference if you play a game for fun and HAVE fun when you go raiding or if you call that hard work and threaten to kick out members and sue them because they caused a wipe or couldn't come because something happened IRL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Congrats to him.<br />
<br />
Damn it. I was in like the borean Tundra for like 3 hours and I only hit halfway to 71.<br />
<br />
And to those flaming, get a life. I find it odd that very people who play WoW tell other WoW players to get a life over stupid stuff like someone getting to 80 first.<br />
<br />
One of the major points of Wrath is to get to 80. The Frenchie did it first, so grats to him. I'm jealous of him right now, cause questing/leveling is a pain in the ass. (And i have to bring up 3 lvl 70 characters to 80).<br />
<br />
For those saying &quot;oh don't rush through it.... Northrend is so special.. blah blah...&quot;<br />
<br />
Hell I could give a shit about the lore. Just let me hit 80, let S5 start so I can arena again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: And once again:<br />
People that do such a thing are not doing it so they can spent more time away from the game with their friends or enjoy the game afterwards.<br />
Such people will go around, showing of the title ingame, looking at all the news sites and feeling only good if everyone else is telling them that their's the biggest they did well.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Psyducking</div><div class="date">2008-11-14, 02:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Instead of flaming the guy, I think we should all be asking what his achievement means?<br />
<br />
I would like to know: Is this a typical leveling time? doubtful... If not, how did he achieve such quick leveling?<br />
<br />
If it only takes less than 20 hours to level to 80 (or only somewhat longer), then what was the point of all that new content? Might as well have kept the level cap at 70 and just added new content like many patches have done. You could still have extended talent trees and new skills. It would also be an opportunity to increase the number of legendary items.<br />
<br />
I'm sure some people will say they enjoying leveling slowly to see all the new content - maybe play out the storylines. Is the new content compelling enough? <br />
<br />
I do know that leveling an alt with the fast leveling from 20-70 was definitely not as satisfying as leveling my main slowly. This is even though I chose to level in areas I had not leveled in before. <br />
<br />
A lot of people though just want to hit end game because maxing out their character is the most satisfying (and probably the most addicting) aspect of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll try a calmer tone, okay, people:<br />
<br />
He (or she) apparently did they same as the one who claimed the world's first lvl70 character for himself:<br />
Get a bunch of people, tab mobs and have the others assist you in killing them. The others are, of course, not in the group with the character, resulting in him/her getting all loot and experience.<br />
<br />
What it is that bothers me (as I said in quite a harsher tone already) is the idea behind this: Get to the highest level only to get attention form the community. 'History', if you want, clearly showed that such a thing is usually done only for showing-off and getting attention. I mean, how many people have you seen with more or less unique weapons, mounts, armor etc just standing in the major city or strutting up and down there?<br />
<br />
And please people: Stop assuming that he'll spent less time ingame now. He will not, as said above. History of all MMO(RP)Gs has shown that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He (or she) apparently did they same as the one who claimed the world's first lvl70 character for himself:<br />
Get a bunch of people, tab mobs and have the others assist you in killing them. The others are, of course, not in the group with the character, resulting in him/her getting all loot and experience.<br />
<br />
What it is that bothers me (as I said in quite a harsher tone already) is the idea behind this: Get to the highest level only to get attention form the community. 'History', if you want, clearly showed that such a thing is usually done only for showing-off and getting attention. I mean, how many people have you seen with more or less unique weapons, mounts, armor etc just standing in the major city or strutting up and down there?<br />
<br />
And please people: Stop assuming that he'll spent less time ingame now. He will not, as said above. History of all MMO(RP)Gs has shown that.<br />
<br />
<br />
thanks for the xplanation. <br />
<br />
So basically the achievement required the help of multiple people. And those people leveled more slowly because he was taking their xp? But you can only do that to a certain point no? Because they would have be a certain level to help this guy. They all should be reaching 80 at about the same time. It seems the same as just leveling in a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's what i menat with my complains: I saw it on the servers I'm on at BC...At first the people that did not 'achieve' to become world's forst level 70 character complained in ALL channels and after they did manage to get 70 pretty fast they started to complain about that it's soooooo boring because noone is there to get to dungeons with them and the mobs are soooo easy to beat and boring...<br />
<br />
I doubt it will be different here...<br />
<br />
<br />
And once again:<br />
<br />
He will not spent less time ingame than we do...It wouldn't get him attention.</div></div><hr />

You claim that desiring to be the best at something makes you a faggot, loser, no-lifer, pathetic, etc. How do you figure? <br />
<br />
You ever play sports with your friends, and you try to lose? You do your best to NOT get promoted, or have a successful career? Then you go out and do your very best to ruin your marriage, right? <br />
<br />
I call shenanigans. Most people are driven by ambition, and they want to win. Olympic athletes, those are some pathetic fucks right? Devoting their whole life to get a stupid hunk of metal and have their name written down in a record book....<br />
<br />
More examples, because I can! When you run that dungeon, do you pull the boss then run around like a dieing chicken and watch yourself get raped, or do you try and win. Oh, how about quests! You definitely go out and do the exact opposite of the quest objective, huh? When I go to BGs, I usually spam /sit when I see the horde, because I'm terrified I just might win. Please tell me you see where this is going....<br />
<br />
People like to win, and like it or not, he won at getting to level 80 before anyone else in the history of the universe. Shame that he spent 20 odd hours to be the very best at something, anything, anything at all. Grats to them<br />

What he did is like doping until the body breaks down under it and sabotating his opponents in order to achieving a record.<br />

Actually he probably has a week or more off now, whats your point? Its just sad to see people flaming someone for the way they wish to play the game. Why people care so much about a human being they apparently despise is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although its my opinion that getting that achievement by mob tagging is cheesy. but anywho...<br />
<br />
If I have to be a no-lifer one week so the rest of the year I can have a life then so be it. I work, have a gf, am very social thus im a casual player but I also like competition and not being left behind and I enjoy grouping at end-game content.<br />
<br />
My solution was simple, I wanted to take this week off so I could level as fast as possible and once my char is 80 I just plan with guildies for runs when its possible. I'll leave enjoying the solo content for when I start to level a DK. This would have give me then plenty of time afterwards to do what I want. <br />
You just have to find what works for you. If its not your style then it's not.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly that plan never happend because 2 weeks prior to the release I got an opportunity to work in mexico helping children on the streets. So I guess I will still be leveling the DK then sloowly and enjoy the content first after all :p<br />
<br />
To the rest enjoy your Wotlk experience!</div></div><hr />

Am I missing part of the story here? Playing World of Warcraft, gaining experience, thats how you level. Staying up for 20 hours is....not a big deal? Thats 4-5 hours longer than your average day. 4-5 hours is going to a late party on friday, or going to a movie for the midnight release, or a romantic late night dinner. Incredibly normal activities that I suspect just about everyone has done sometime in the past year. All I know is from the news post of &quot;French dude hits 80, no power leveling involved&quot; Who was sabotaged?</div></div><hr />

He did not use a powerleveling third party program service thing, yes, but the point of the story is, as said, that he DID went to northrend with some friends and had them kill mobs he tapped, so he would get all the exp and loot from the mob. It's unlikely he did a quest or a dungeon.</div></div><hr />

Only people that have a hard time getting laid think its great to get laid every single day. When you're there, its not all its cracked up to be. Sure, its nice, but giving it up for ONE day is not the end of the world, and I can promise you that most people with significant others for more than 2 years or so don't have sex every day. Long story short, if you think its better to get laid for one day out of your life than to do something that you couldn't do any other day, you need to get laid more.<br />
<br />
How is staying up for like 3 hours more than normal hazardous to your health? As someone else said, its like going out on a Friday night and getting home a few hours later than you'd normally go to bed. ZOMG HEALTH CONCERN!<br />
<br />
Sure, not everybody wants to be the first 80 in the world, and most probably don't care but there is no reason to flame him for stupid reasons when you're too stupid to think or too young/annoying to have a girlfriend or wife that will allow you to &quot;get laid&quot; any night of the week.</div></div><hr />

He did spend considerable time planning it I'm sure, but is it more than everyone else spends? Unlikely. Put simply, there's no way to say that the guy has no life.

World first level 80 character is French !<br />
French people just run faster it seems ... Nymh - Drek'thar [FR] (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek%27thar&amp;n=Nymh) was the first character to reach level 80 in the new expansion - Wrath of the Lich King ! Congratulations to him and his guild, Genesis (http://www.guilde-genesis.org) !<br />
<br />
In case you're wondering, there isn't too much fancy powerleveling behind that, just a healer out of group. <br />
