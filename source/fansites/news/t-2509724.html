Pirates Day - September 19th<br />
Pirate's Day is coming to Azeroth tomorrow!<br />
Hoist sail and make way for Booty Bay because Pirate’s Day begins September 19!<br />
<br />
Bring Your Sea Shanty to Booty Bay<br />
Pirates have taken over the goblin town of Booty Bay and Captain DeMeza is recruiting any scurvy dog she can into her buccaneer ranks. Visit her or her henchmen in the capital cities if the pirate’s life is for you!<br />
<br />
Feeling out of place in Booty Bay without a proper costume? Don’t worry. /Dance one little jig with the Dread Captain DeMeza and she’ll be impressed enough to press you into her crew and outfit you properly. If you get attached to your new look, you can do the quest You’re Gonna Need a Bigger Boat! Succeed, and you’ll get an Emergency Pirate Outfit (or five) for when Pirate’s Day is but a distant memory and your inner pirate is clawing to get out.<br />
<br />
What good is a pirate without an avian companion on their shoulder? Captain DeMeza (for the exchange of a few shiny coins) can help you call forth a temporary companion named Petey to take with you wherever you sail.<br />
<br />
From time to time the captain will shout for a brave party to take on a terror of the deeps–an elite shark known as Ol’Eary. Make sure you have a hearty crew with you or you could become just so much chum in the waters of the bay.<br />
<br />
Join the Beach Party<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/september/thumb/piratesday01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/september/piratesday01.jpg)<br />
<br />
Once you and your crew have helped the captain handle Ol’Eary, you can celebrate with the crew at a little beach party just south of Booty Bay. Those with the Feat of Strength &quot;Advast Ye, Admiral&quot; can also purchase a toy from Edward Techt–the Jolly Roger to show off their dedication to the cause.<br />
<br />
If you’re really feeling generous, you can also purchase a Big Bag of Booty from Captain DeMeza and spread the wealth around to all your pirate pals in a burst of glittery glory.</div></div><hr />

Then get it and use it on your Alliance characters. Don't use it on your Horde characters. I'm sure you probably have Alliance characters that this bee mount will look good on, just like the Alliance has a lot of mounts only it can use and Horde, the same. (And if you don't have any Alliance characters, you're missing a lot more than a bee.)<br />

No it's not. It's a plainly retarded move because it breaks both the number of reputations and mounts collectable between factions.<br />
<br />
P.s. Okay, I think it evens the number of mounts out because Horde had the Pterrordax recolors after getting Pathfinder. Nearly forgot about those. But I don't remember Horde having any specific reputations without Alliance counterpart.<br />
<br />
So you get your unique bees for recolors that Horde got. Can you now please shut up with your horses?</div></div><hr />

I don't see it stated anywhere in this news that Horde can't even use it after it is earned, so why is that the assumption? (and so strong of an assumption that we'd get upset over it) Is there more information elsewhere?<br />

<br />
I know its not the same, but since you like horses--theres a horse you guys can get from a rare in Arathi Highlands when you have control of the warfront, and I also think theres a horse with horde armor you guys can get from leveling an alliance toon and doing the war campaign on it. That 'two sides for every story' achieve. <br />
<br />
The color for the Arathi horse is actually pretty nice, it kind of reminds me of a clydestale because it has that kind of pattern on its coat, and its mane sweeps over to the side like the unicorns from the Broken Isles.<br />
<br />
Its saddle is kind of goofy looking, but that's not too bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
On topic, is it possible that maybe the alliance gets access to one color of the mount during the quest chain, but the other two colorations that were datamined before BFA launched could be accessable by both? Perhaps as drops? We can't really rule that out, and though lots of people mention the bees, no one ever brings up that there were 3 dif colors of them.</div></div><hr />

Its the same....the &quot;soul crushing grind&quot; allows the OPTION to do it at a pace that suits you. Time gated by quests means, well, this is the pace, come back tomorrow to keep our DAU and MAU numbers up .</div></div><hr />

Nothing personal... But blizzard decided to put your race into THE goofy derpy faction in WoW, that's why you get all the goofy and derpy mounts. Even if your race is very beautiful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't followed any information on it if they've confirmed elsewhere that Horde can't even use it, but it would make sense if it just functioned like Kaufon.<br />
<br />
It was datamined as such and hasn’t been changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you don't even like the bee? Why do you care then?<br />
<br />
Because I need it to count for my main’s mount count for the achievement. Since they have more usable mounts than any of my other characters. I also like to have all my exalted reps on my main.<br />

<br />
You got a hyena, a blood swarmer, and a pterodax while the Alliance got a black horse, a white horse, and an off-white horse.<br />
<br />
All of which the Alliance can also get.</div></div><hr />

It's the usual hoarding phenomena, people love to build shrines to themselves for obvious purposes, this along with the gambling aspect makes us easy to manipulate or capitalize on our desires. On the individual level what we do with our time is the crux of whether this is good or bad. It can come down to where we're headed together as well I suppose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're correct, I DON'T care, not in the slightest... because this is a stupid, silly argument. <br />
<br />
The only thing preventing a Horde-only player from getting a bee mount is rolling an Alliance character. And since I'd bet that over 99% of the player base has at least one character from the opposing faction -- ESPECIALLY during BFA, where there is a completely separate and distinctive leveling storyline and experience on the other side -- then this becomes a non-issue, except for the select few who remain stubborn. <br />
<br />
If being stubbornly Horde-only is a thing for you, then you can live without a bee mount. Life will go on.</div></div><hr />

Wheee...so far this thread goes unexpected places. People mostly discuss (well, rather flame each other and are salty about) the bee mount and not how store mounts kill(ed) WoW.<br />
<br />
/amazed :p<br />
<br />
The store mounts are generally boring and ugly. They are less of a problem than blizzcon specific mounts and trading card game mounts.<br />
<br />

<br />
Funny how after all these years and 32493932 mounts in their collection - that you can't use all at the same time anyway - people are still going bonkers for new mounts. <br />
I don't really get it.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of the mounts in the game are ugly and dumb. People like things that are new and not ugly.<br />
<br />
The biggest problem with mounts these days are they are too easy to get. There is a grind that takes X days to get them and on X+1 day half the people you see are using that new mount they were excited to get... but when everyone else has it too it isn't special and then it becomes boring.<br />
<br />
We need more mounts like the War Bear where you can only get it if you're in the top Y% of the population and it looks cool enough to use regularly.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know we have the Mechagon mount and mythic raid mounts. I'm just asking for a few more. Maybe even themed ones per dungeon.</div></div><hr />

I do find one of the more expensive mounts ugly, the whatever forged Nightmare...whatever the thing is called that costs 30 Euros. The Dreadwake is actually kinda nice...also glad the spider mount is exclusively in-game for now.<br />
<br />
How any of this is a problem, I never understood...but maybe I just have a tighter control on my spending habits. Also I truly believe that any company should have the right to make you an offer - and that you as a customer should be the one who can refuse it to the point that they go out of business because of their bad choices. Just don't blame the company when thousands of idiots buy the shit they offer.<br />
<br />
If I could not live by that belief, I would go crazy by the amount of crap that is offered and consumed from ...say...fast food places or trash stores.</div></div><hr />

The problem is Blizzard has incentive to make all the best looking mounts paid store mounts and make the in game mounts look bad to increase sales.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I don't think that has happened (despite having incentive to).<br />
<br />
It did happen in the past, as the Spectral Tiger and the Blizzard Polar Bear + Murloc mounts were the best mounts in the game for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right...IIRC somebody in this thread said &quot;Not a problem, because all store mounts are ugly&quot; and you claim they are the best...so that is taste right here. I think (as I said earlier) one of the ugliest mount is the most expensive and several mounts are pretty &quot;meh&quot; (though admittedly unique looking)<br />
<br />
Spectral Tiger / Polar Bear I believe are promotion / Blizzcon mounts? Not shop mounts? The murloc mounts I don't recall.<br />
<br />
I can get behind the idea that a company does things to &quot;increase sales&quot; - Jesus...who couldn't? We live and thrive high riding capitalism...so color me shocked - and don't pretend it is a Blizzard only thing..you would be ignoring the world around it and probably couldn't stand your everyday life if you applied that same standard.<br />
<br />
Finally, on a personal note I disagree with &quot;in game mounts look bad&quot; - my mounts that are marked as &quot;favorite&quot; or used extensively all are in-game mounts: Be it the water striders pre-flying or the Yak with the vendors - but beyond that the Sky Golem (on herbalists), the spider mount (always awesome) the Warframe, the Netherwing mounts from TBC, the drake from the emissary cache of Legion...Ashes of Alar, Frostbrood Vanquisher, Ratscallion, and so on...<br />
<br />
But hey...taste and all...sure, the Fey Dragon is nice...but to me there are a TON of great looking in-game mounts...and finally the much anticipated Bee mount is also available in game...and not as one could have expected in the shop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Typical. Alliance get access to both a mount and a rep that the Horde don’t have and before someone points at Kua’fon or Child of Torcali, both of those mounts can be used on Alliance toons once earned on Horde and they don’t have a reputation associated with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's just cry and whine about it for a year or so and we get our own Horde version of the mount, bit darker and with more spikes, like it obviously should be for a Horde mount...<br />
That's usually how the Alliance gets what they want, so just follow the example.</div></div><hr />
