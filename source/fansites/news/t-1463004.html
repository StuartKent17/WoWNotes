I guess beta could start next week or the week after that but only in waves and probably not even dungeons opened to begin with, really surprised they've delayed beta info for this long to be honest. At this rate WoD won't hit until August and even that's optimistic, either they're really confident in their game atm or they'll push beta testings really quickly.</div></div><hr />

I'm actually wishing the new orc model was in the game now &gt;.&lt; The one we have is so terrible. I've tried playing a pandaren, and the arm swing of the orcs is nothing compared to the lope like run of the pandaren...<br />

Oh but they aren't, that's the funny part. Why would Blizzard go out of their way to adjust a texture by adding different wrinkles on their face (which, for all it's worth, look actually well made and polished) if it was only meant to be a placeholder?</div></div><hr />

I must admit I too have gone from being pleased with the first peek of the new orc model to being very disappointed with the look of the orcs in this update.<br />
<br />
Their faces all look the same and the scale is off, Bratz lollipop look with small hunched bodies. Too comical as far as I am concerned. I am assuming (hoping) that all the models in this basically have 1 face as that's all they have made so far and that this will change as more come on line, but currently I'd probably set mine to keep the old model as I don't like the gormless look this one has.<br />
<br />
That being said, I think the scale is off in any event, head is too big, body is too peon like.</div></div><hr />

Not because of the models, but because of the buildings and other objects/scenery. The new look characters stand out a lot. You can say - never happy - but it's a worthwhile point to raise. <br />

Like, they're not focused or something. I don't know. If anyone remembers that texture oopsie during Wrath (http://www.bananashoulders.com/2008/09/11/breaking-news-new-facial-models/) where the alpha textures got put on the models, it reminds me of that. I hope that they just need to go through a final polish, but some of the models (mostly gnome male and dwarf female) just don't seem to have that spark of life that the older models did.</div></div><hr />

Those are literally all the exact same face. The logical conclusion is that the other copies are placeholders. Don't freak out.<br />

This isn't true. If you take a closer look, you will see that they are all different, but only very slightly. Mostly some shadows between nose and mouth, on chin and on the foreheads.<br />

You should remember that this is just a glimpse of 2 new zones. You really haven't seen much of the expansion yet. We don't know anything about end game contents, or the other zones, so I believe we should not judge WoD so harshly.<br />
<br />
Also we all know that it's one of the most boring things in the world to watch someone else play an MMO. At least there is a huge difference between watching someone play, and actually playing it! There is an awesome story and surely some really epic quests there too which we could not see yet!<br />
<br />
As for the faces of the new Orc model.. Well, I could be naive, but somehow I doubt there will not be any more differences between them. My guess is they made x copies of the original face, and used all of them when they created mobs and NPCs, so when they actualy have the time to update each of the faces, they will automatically update in the world as well. There are some wrinkle variations already, but I think more variations of the nose, eyes and ears will follow later on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which makes it even more important that they start giving the faces more diversity in facial features, like one guy with a large nose, one with big bushy eyebrows or one with puffier cheeks etc. Whatever it takes to be able to tell them apart. Right now the orc faces look like the exact same guy, just in different stages/ages of his life..</div></div><hr />

It's mostly through the shading on the texture to simulate differences in facial structure (more pronounced bone structure, a heavier brow, etc). However, the differences just aren't going to read well unless you zoom your camera right up a character's nose. They're going to need to really punch it up if they want to avoid &quot;sameface&quot; complaints. A major stumbling block there (especially with the orc skins) is that there's not much complexity to the colors, giving them a &quot;modeling clay&quot; sort of look. One thing I've learned from Face Off is that you lose a lot of detail with a paintjob that's too simple for your sculpt. Enhancing the shadows/highlights on those faces would go a long way, especially if the colors were a little more nuanced (different complexions for different faces, a little more color blending, etc). One thing that would help (and a suggestion I will give if I ever have the good fortune to be invited to the beta someday) is to add an &quot;other facial features&quot; slider to some of the races, similar to the Goblin ear/nose/chin options. Things that slightly alter the physical sculpt of the face. That might be more difficult with the newer more expressive faces, but it would help add a lot of character to them. The more outlandish races already have that of course (Tauren horns, Troll tusks, Draenei horns/squidbeards, undead &quot;attachments&quot;), and those are the primary way you can tell one character of those races from another. Aside from hairstyle and beard/jewelry, which a number of races have in addition to the extra features, a good example for orcs would be things like mismatched tusks, different ears, scars and tattoos, noses, war paint, etc. <br />
<br />
I feel like this won't be as much of a problem with the more &quot;human-like&quot; races, since the complexion and shading palette is more well established for human skin and thus differences in those aspects will be more apparent, but I see all of the above as potential issues for the races with weird skin tones and/or facial anatomy, including Draenei and perhaps Trolls and Night Elves. <br />
But, just adding scars/tattoos/warpaint to the existing faces, as well as punching up the shading and improving the color complexity, would do a lot to differentiate one orc from another.</div></div><hr />

I don't like any of the races seen show far, though I do see the improvement. It's just not so much improvement that it deserves this extreme hype everyone has over it.

<br />
I don't like the orc hunch at all. I'm really hoping for Throne of Thunder style troll models, but I doubt that will happen because they for some reason want to keep everything as close to the original as possible. I'm really hoping for longer more animated tails, better tentacles, and more horns for all of the Draenei, as well as new reduced frames for the male draenei, but I imagine it will just be the exact same with more animations, giant doll eyes because I guess they needed to make them larger to give them more range of motion, and more shadowing thrown into it to create an optical illusion that they have some kind of 3d muscle definition. <br />
<br />
Perhaps I'm in the minority, but I feel like they should have gone even further out of the box and completely redone the models with new everything and no previous influence other than what's mandated by the race's features. What would have really been great is if they had created different models to showcase and let us vote on the ones we wanted.

So your basically saying a big fuck you to all those who fell in love with the race they play as and just want to alienate them? I think the way they are doing it now is the best way to go about. Keeping the look and feel of the original models and just upping their detail.</div></div><hr />

They are not exactly the same, which is more worrying. There is a VERY small difference between them, such as shading below the eyes etc. I guess we get new models at the expense of losing any meaningful choice when it comes to faces. If you need to strain your eyes to see the difference on a still image, in game they will all look identical. If this doesn't change, its pathetic.</div></div><hr />

A 10 year old game does not look like a 1 year old game even with some better shaders. That's a real surprise. <br />

Example:<br />

That dk had a red weapon for most of the video, didn't move out of the telegraphed attacks, and at the end when Thrall goes all Twister on the ogres, not only does he cover the ground effect with his character model, but when Thrall says &quot;stand back&quot; he seems to make a point of moving in front of Thrall and placing the camera in such a way that it misses the whole action.<br />
<br />
These videos don't make me want to play WoD, they make me want to punch a Korean.</div></div><hr />

The hands, feet, ears and cloths still looks like extremely outdated. I know its work in progress so I'm looking forward to seeing the finished product.<br />
<br />
Only thing that looks bad is the feet, rest looks good. Idk what u dislike aboutthem, butthis is the final product.</div></div><hr />

That's the only thing I dislike about the male orcs. I'll change my mind as soon as I see (hopefully) new faces but atm I'm sick to death of seeing that Garrosh face everywhere.</div></div><hr />

if anyone else notices, the person playing the dk is using a 1 handed weapon, and he is only using one. hence the small amount of damage going out.</div></div><hr />

Why? They chance constantly, so all you'll see is what was in the game at that moment in time only to be gone next patch like every other beta cycle.</div></div><hr />

First of all, please learn how to doge. That was embarrassing to read.<br />

<br />
Yeah no kidding - I think when WOD launches, if I play it I'll have to just shut off the number display. Watching the guy run around timeless isle hitting for almost nothing looked really, really lame to me. Super lame. I've heard all the excuses as to why they need to do it, and it still logs like crap to me. Oh well. Just turn the numbers off, the damage seemed about right in terms of the bars going up and down, which was their goal.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cptaylor38</div><div class="date">2014-02-23, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So your basically saying a big fuck you to all those who fell in love with the race they play as and just want to alienate them? I think the way they are doing it now is the best way to go about. Keeping the look and feel of the original models and just upping their detail.<br />
<br />
I said they should have presented more model types and let the community decide. I don't have a problem with it being optional to remain same or similar, but I think their potential was held back by trying to keep it too similar expecting the community to not like them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it's a matter of personal preference. As you say, you think it's lame, which is a perfectly okay opinion to have. Me, I like it.<br />
<br />
The larger the numbers, the less comprehensible they become. I prefer the smaller numbers as I feel it's easier to wrap my head around.<br />
<br />
In the end though, it doesn't really matter all that much, it's just numbers, and as long as they are balanced dealing 200 DPS or 200.000.000 DPS makes no difference.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boxilot</div><div class="date">2014-02-23, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We got like, what, ten minutes of gameplay from two people who don't even comment along and you're all wailing in despair that it looks so boring and omg it is just a rehash? You're all trying too hard to be edgy, seriously. <br />
<br />
People who whine and cry that &quot;its just the same, amagah&quot; are idiots. Nothing more, nothing less. WoW has ALWAYS been WoW, it will never change. They will try out new stuff and ditch old stuff, but in the end it will always be WoW, which is a ten year old game based off of the classic MMORPG genre. Give yourself and the game a break. A new expansion won't change shit, and if you think it will you're delusional, and need to go play something else. <br />
<br />
I was worried that we'd get the &quot;one face-syndrom&quot; all since the beginning of this. And the way the devs talk about it, it seems like it is very likely that that is what we're getting. BUT they also talked about having to make it customizable in different ways, which leads me to believe we'll get more accessory details, so to speak (that might be possible to change at the barber). They did talk a lot about how they don't want to disappoint those who are attatched to their characters so *shrug* we'll just have to wait and see. I am sure they'll talk more about it soon, as it has the playerbase really on edge.</div></div><hr />

Secondly - I don't know why but it really annoys me seeing someone who clearly haven't played the game, trying to play it for a press event gameplay footage. It ruined it a bit for me tbh. Sure, the video isn't about showing off the combat and skill but the animation and environment BUT they could atleast have recorded someone who knows what they're doing. I've never played a DK before but even I know that a single one handed sword is not how you play, and using Dark Command (a taunt!!) when solo killing mobs isn't something any wow player would normally do (unless I guess that player doesn't give a flying on how to play his/her class).</div></div><hr />
