Prepare to fight your last battles of the season—Warlords Season 3 will end at 2:00 a.m. PDT on July 19, 2016.<br />
<br />
After the season wraps, we will begin the process of determining eligibility for end-of-season rewards. If you believe that you’ve qualified for Warlords Season 3 PvP rewards, please refrain from transferring your character(s) to another realm or faction until awards are granted approximately two weeks later.<br />
<br />
The next PvP season, Legion Season 1, will begin after World of Warcraft: Legion launches on August 30. In the meantime, all Honor and Conquest Points will be converted to in-game currency at a rate of 35 silver per point. Also, Rated Battleground and Arena matches will not be available during the break between seasons. We will confirm the start date of the forthcoming Legion Season 1 at a later date.<br />
<br />
Please note that the end of the season does not require a patch to the game, and will occur automatically.<br />
<br />
Your days are numbered—get out there and fight!</div></div><hr />

All this really confirms is that the patch won't drop on the 12th. They even called out that this doesn't mean it's patch day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it just reads that the end of the PVP season doesn't require a patch and will happen automatically. Which means 7.0 could drop next week still, and the pvp season will automatically end on the 19th, without needing a patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No... It's the 19th. Pre-patch drops the day the season ends. It's been like this for last 5 expansions, it ain't gonna change now. We go through this every expansion and every time people are being stupid.</div></div><hr />

They say that so if they have to delay the patch for some last minute critical issue, people don't get all crazy worried when they don't see a patch that day and wonder if the season is still going on.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't require a patch because we already downloaded the patch on the background downloader yesterday 7/7/2016. I'm 99% sure the patch is going to be playable on the 19th, as all the other dates for season ends have been on the same day with other major patches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I liked it as well, many people did. But those who did don't come here to whine and complain like you. So it's not apparent who they are and how many there are. They're busy enjoying the game. xD You're just bored of the game because you're human and that's natural and that's ok! But instead of admitting you're ready to move on, you'd rather blame the creators and say they're not sufficiently entertaining you. That's like ordering pizza every night for dinner, and complaning to the pizza restaurant that their food sucks because you're tired of pizza, instead of simply ordering from a different restaurant.</div></div><hr />

Blizz usually gives people a two week heads up.. to a casual like me, it's ample time to get those last 10 rbg's in :) - for the haters, it's joy that your expansion you hate so much is ending, and for everyone else who has no idea wtf is going on: You'll see your long lost friends log in and resubbing just to see the new pre-patch, then leaving because they are burned out hasbeens (back in MYYYYY day crowd get fucking rekt) - that always show up for patch's like clockwork and find ouy they still suck ass at the game regardless if it's a new patch, and hopefully quit for good.<br />
<br />
O.o I don't think you realize how many mythic raid teams took a break simply because they were bored out of their skull. I quit for 6 months, partially b/c I was moving and didn't see much point in paying for a sub during a content drought when I had more important things to be doing. When I did come back I found out most of my team had unsubbed till pre-patch b/c they didn't feel like farming Archi till their eyes bled like we did Garry. WoD was pretty darn boring, but the fact that it followed a 14 month content drought in MoP didn't help it any either.</div></div><hr />

Miss what? There's been no reason to leave the garrison since launch aside from Tanaan, fly to a raid, or Ashran if you PvP.<br />
<br />
People can hate on MoP all they want, but we did get Thunder Isle, Isle of Giants, and Timeless Isle. Scenarios were actually not horrible either, the rewards just didn't make them worthwhile to a lot of people. So yea, people were sick of SoO by the time it ended, but there was at least content added whether you liked it or not.<br />
<br />
The only useful thing to come out of WoD is the garrison, and that's only because you could abuse the daylights out of it for gold. I can't think of a single part of compelling gameplay in WoD outside of an instance once level capped.</div></div><hr />

I enjoyed Cata. But, that's the expansion where I created/leveled most of my alts, so I had plenty of character slots to keep me occupied back then. Most of them carried over into MoP. Less than half of those have even stepped foot in Draenor. And 1 of those is only bc of the free boost.<br />

<br />
The lose in subs isn't why they stopped reporting numbers. It caused panic everytime and it was meant to show the health of the game. The game from a business perspective is no longer based on subs because of the shop and because not all subs cost the same anymore. A token sub is worth a hell of a lot more to blizzard than a regular subscription. I pay $11.99 a month. Some people are paying $20.99 a month now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Half its sub base... when the game is already in some form of decline... when the expansion was heavily touted to be a return to Burning Crusade and, let's face it, wasn't...<br />
<br />
I just don't think we can honestly say WHY all those people left. We can speculate, but can we really say that, what, six million people up and left because &quot;it sucked&quot;? Come on. Six million people will have six million reasons, and some are gonna be similar, sure, but all of them? Nah.<br />
<br />
We don't know, for instance, how many were just looky-loos. Subbed/resubbed to have a look around, didn't like what they saw, so they left. Doesn't mean, like people love to say, that they ran out of content or whatever. That they killed Archi in LFR and quit because there was nothing left to do. Maybe it just wasn't what they wanted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bit of an unfair point to make.<br />
<br />
WoD also brought back a TON of people who hadn't played since WotLK / Cataclysm. <br />
Just before and while WoD came out the amount of subscribers went up with 3 million back up to cataclysm levels. <br />
<br />
WoD might have lost just under half it's player base, but that just remotely puts it back to levels where it would have been without that spike in subs.<br />
<br />
Despite it's many flaws; WoD had some really good things going. The raids were pretty solid; not Ulduar/ICC level, but definitely much better than Cataclysm and the first tier of MoP. <br />
Quests and questlines were solid; good lore, some great characters and amazing ending cinematics in the zones.<br />
Garrisons had some good things going for them, they missed the mark on a few important things (too much free gathering; gated professions; too much gain from doing it on many alts), but it had some good stuff as well. The feeling of your own base/town was nice; I personally quite liked the missions, even in their simplicity, they felt somewhat rewarding. <br />
<br />
We'll probably just get on the complain-train in Legion again as well; but for all it's upcoming flaws, it's bound to have some really good stuff as well.<br />
From what I can tell the new transmog system looks good, the new world quest system looks solid and the profession changes look quite good at first sight as well.</div></div><hr />

i agree. fuck him. im on beta and i was on alpha. Legion is fantastic and the new features are well done. visuals are stunning and the story line build up is definitely something you just want to keep following. PVP is broken? what beta wasnt pvp broken on? Nothing is tuned properly...because its beta. However, i wont be a blizzard brown-noser and not tell it like it is. I really hate how the classes have been stripped down. My action bars for my warlock on beta compared to my warlock on live are practically empty. They took away so much and/or made it passive. They actually took away shadowfury...seriously. the one nice little stun mechanic we had. was it really breaking the game that it had to go?</div></div><hr />

Even Blizzard's trying to brush this cashcow under the rug to focus more on Overwatch and Hearthstone.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly certain Legions going to be an even bigger flop than WoD:<br />
&quot;You can't possibly say that! It's not even out yet! don't be ridiculous!&quot;<br />
<br />
Guys, come on, wake up.. most people left WoD before it even finished due to terrible design choices, ashran, lack of challenging content that wasn't artificially difficult + the evergrowing list of issues from the last 8 or so years where problems have kept piling up -- and then, that wasn't all, even more people left over the year waiting period.<br />
<br />
Blizzard already used the &quot;We've changed, This time it'll be a clean slate&quot; card with WoD, and they blew it...hard. Unless people just forgot, or decided not to hold grudges.<br />
<br />
And hell, After playing the alpha/beta? the lack of content is palpable, the breadth of change is slim and the content ocean is more like a content puddle. Honestly, I'd be surprised if Sub numbers got above 7 million, and I'd be even more surprised if they stayed for more than 2 months after launch.<br />

A game that isn't in early alpha state. They'll never get the balancing done before release. Everything I've seen yet says &quot;It's WoD 2.0&quot; with less gold on your garrison and even worse pvp season 1.</div></div><hr />

Guys, come on, wake up.. most people left WoD before it even finished due to terrible design choices, ashran, lack of challenging content that wasn't artificially difficult + the evergrowing list of issues from the last 8 or so years where problems have kept piling up -- and then, that wasn't all, even more people left over the year waiting period.<br />

Blizzard already used the &quot;We've changed, This time it'll be a clean slate&quot; card with WoD, and they blew it...hard. Unless people just forgot, or decided not to hold grudges.<br />

And hell, After playing the alpha/beta? the lack of content is palpable, the breadth of change is slim and the content ocean is more like a content puddle.

dude, you really think that?????? even at the state of WoW at the moment, the game still is the biggest MMO out there. With FF comming second but no close. <br />
<br />
You sound like any other of the 100 that ever expansion said that is the end of WoW<br />

why you dont stop playing then and go play something more, but nothing from Legion say &quot;WoD 2.0&quot;</div></div><hr />

Sorry (not) but that's a pretty damned delusional way of reasoning... Looking forward to laughing at the next person burping the same shit when we're facing the next expansion, and the 10th, and 11th...</div></div><hr />

It caused panic everytime and it was meant to show the health of the game. The game from a business perspective is no longer based on subs because of the shop and because not all subs cost the same anymore. A token sub is worth a hell of a lot more to blizzard than a regular subscription. I pay $11.99 a month. Some people are paying $20.99 a month now.<br />
<br />
You can believe whatever you want. The truth is: Millions left and Blizzard shit and went blind. WoD has not been kind to them.<br />
They went from bragging about the amount of players to ... worrying about player panic about people leaving. That tells you a lot in and of itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even me? Am I supposed to know you or something?<br />
<br />
And that's not fact, it's speculation. Unless you've polled millions of people, you only know they quit. You don't know why, any more than I do. We can guess, you can project your own bias, but unless you have word of Blizz, you don't know.<br />
<br />
<br />
You'd have to be incredibly silly to think millions left because they are happy or simply couldn't afford it but millions stayed because Wrath was fun.<br />
And you, personally, have nothing on this. I don't know you, I don't care about you. You, as a singular person, are irrelevant to millions. Right now you're just apologizing for Blizzard and being defensive.</div></div><hr />

Well If you're right it's bad news for all of us, btw I'm not interested in wow-pvp anymore (since cata), so if only pvp is what concerns you badly, then it's OK for me.</div></div><hr />

It's fact. It's lost more subs than any other expansion so far. So much so they stopped reporting numbers. That's not something insignificant. No *why* might be subjective...<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
And yet, more than double the amount of people subbed now quit the expansion. You are not the majority.<br />
<br />
And yet, they also gained more Suns than any expansion before. So once again, your opinion is not shared by everyone. Whining about expansion is pathetic, and that is a fact. If I don't like an expansion I just quit and go play something else. I took off over a year during Cataclysm. Did not spend hours bitching and crying on forums</div></div><hr />

They'd have no reason to really care if half the players left. It is still up and by far the biggest MMO and most profitable MMO on the market and has been in that state for the last 12 years. Hell, even after half the players left it is still turning profits and blizzard is still in a good spot. WoW is their hardest to maintain game and from a business point of view they could completely shut down WoW and still be fine. Every time they announced subs, increase or decrease the &quot;End of WoW&quot; or &quot;WoW is dying threads continued. When they went up in Wrath it was casuals ruined the game. Went down in Cata cause WoW was dying. Went up in MoP and too many babies play Kung Fu Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

No, right now he's calling you out for talking out of your ass. You have no clue why player base left. Some came back to test out new expac, then left. Some left due to no flying for first year. Some left due to lack of max level content. Some left because they only play first month-two of new tier. You randomly spouting shit doesn't make it a fact</div></div><hr />

I honestly question if you truely did play the Legion beta. If it is one thing players agree on with Legion, is that is appears to have far more varied and interesting content out the door the WoD ever did. Minus the stupid changes for some classes, the expansion is shaping up to be pretty decent. If it were not for Blizz abandoning WoD after one major patch, it would not be as bad.<br />
<br />
I won't disagree with you that WoW is not in a great state at the moment, but we have all heard &quot;WoW will be dead in X amount of time&quot; so many times I have lost count.</div></div><hr />

You guys forget the BEST feature ever made by far for wow in Legion, WARDROBE, this feature alone can turn Legion in best expansion ever. New animations are amazing and we have a new class this expansion. I think Legion will be the best expansion by far.</div></div><hr />

no, there is no way in hell blizzard would drop the patch before the season ends. Massive class balance changes for the last week of rated pvp would be the worst possible thing they could do.<br />

The patch very likely could still drop on the 19th, and i bet it will, but the way the season ending thing was worded left them room to delay if they decide they need to / want to.</div></div><hr />

you arent alone i enjoy WoD too, got burn at the end bc really 1 year of the same raid was boring but i never unsub since i been playing for free since they make the token. <br />

It's in the background downloader, so it won't prompt for a download like other patches or even show that it's updating. By default, you'll just see a green arrow on the WoW page of your battle.net app and it caps the download at, I believe, 100 kbps unless you change the setting.</div></div><hr />

IDK, I guess I felt like - since I only play a few hours a week typically - I had a lot to do this expansion? I guess obviously for people who played every fucking day, sure this expansion would be total shit because content droughts been here since Day0 WoD? It's my opinion though so, fuck me right?<br />

O.o I don't think you realize how many mythic raid teams took a break simply because they were bored out of their skull. I quit for 6 months, partially b/c I was moving and didn't see much point in paying for a sub during a content drought when I had more important things to be doing. When I did come back I found out most of my team had unsubbed till pre-patch b/c they didn't feel like farming Archi till their eyes bled like we did Garry. WoD was pretty darn boring, but the fact that it followed a 14 month content drought in MoP didn't help it any either.<br />
<br />
100% agree, if you guys are badass mythic owning arch - I would of unsubbed as well. I mean obviously raiding is what wow is all about, their is nothing else in the game worth subbing for (Garrisons = Free Sub). I again agree on the shitty content drought.. I have nothing I can say against that</div></div><hr />

I wish there had been something other than raiding worth subbing for in WoD. There just wasn't. Even the free sub option using gold seemed like a waste when I had literally completed everything but pet battles which I don't personally enjoy. Now Legion I feel that will be different. Legion offers plenty of content options so even if the team I'm with decides to take a break I can still work on things. We haven't had that in a long time.</div></div><hr />

Pre-patch drops the day the season ends. It's been like this for last 5 expansions, it ain't gonna change now. We go through this every expansion and every time people are being stupid.<br />
<br />
I would be very surprised if prepatch dosnt start at the 19th.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might be able to continue to farm conquest points in Ashran to buy them. I don't think they're converting honor and conquest until Legion Season 1 starts. After that, I imagine the S3 gear will be available for honor at a legacy vendor.</div></div><hr />
