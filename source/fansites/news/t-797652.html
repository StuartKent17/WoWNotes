Addons - AtlasLoot v6.00.00 Released<br />
The latest version of AtlasLoot (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/atlasloot-enhanced.aspx) has been released and is now fully updated for Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
Most importantly, the new Cataclysm client changed how items are stored in the client and you no longer have to wait for the item to be active on your server to have it displayed properly in AtlasLoot. The current version of Atlasloot should get you a decent list of most of the items you will get in the expansion and you should be able to check most of them in-game with the proper drop location, ability to try them out in the dress-up room, etc...<br />

Try a clean reinstall.<br />
<br />
1. Delete every AtlasLoot folder (even the files in the wtf folder).<br />
2. Log in.<br />
3. Completely log out.<br />
4. Reinstall AtlasLoot.<br />
5. Hope it works.<br />

Granted, this is the only build I looked at, I'm sure the other three are equally as bad.<br />
<br />
Allow me to elaborate for you, Boub:<br />
<br />
Case: is fine.<br />
PSU: is overkill, but is relatively fine.<br />
CPU: The 930 is out-dated. The 950 can be had for the same (or lower) price, and is better,<br />
Cooling: I will give chaud credit here. He single-handedly picked the worst air cooling solution you could possibly get at that price point. If you don't want water, you have many other (much, much better) choices. Noctua NH-D14, Thermalright Silver Arrow, etc. Or if you want a low profile closed-loop system for simple CPU cooling, something like a Corsair H50 or H70 would be perfect.<br />
Mobo: This one is debatable, but I'd much rather have an ASUS Rampage III Formula or something, many more features targeted to the gamer population, better board overall.<br />
Memory: That memory is absolute trash. 9 cas latency? Really? Those timings are horrendous. You can get kits for the same price or cheaper that have much, MUCH tighter timings-- like 6 or 7 CL.<br />
Video: This &quot;high-end&quot; build and you pick a HD 5870? What is the point of that? Drop another $150 and get a MUCH better card, a GTX 580.<br />
HDD: The Caviar Greens are alright but the Caviar Blacks are a couple dollars more and much better. This is a &quot;high-end&quot; rig afterall, isn't it?<br />
SSD: Wow, two decent SSDs. Got something right.<br />
<br />
I just hope someone with some money to blow doesn't see the system in the news post and goes out to Amazon and wastes their money on a sub-par system. If anyone here wants to actually get the best mileage out of their dollar and have much better performance, you can PM me here. Give me your budget and I'll walk you through a good build-- just please don't build anything you see on this news post.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming you want one with a SATA connection, right?<br />

Here's a drive that will last you forever, and is priced just right:<br />

I'd like to argue this point. They may have changed from CRT to LCD to LED. They might have increased contrast ratios, reduced response time, but they really have done nothing to improve the image quality. a CRT from 15 years ago can produce just as sharp an image as monitors display today. There have been no actual advances in increasing the resolution of screens, they just make them bigger. <br />

I'll buy that &quot;advances in monitors&quot; when they increase the density of pixels on my screen tyvm.Without getting into a CRT vs flat panel argument (some can be very religious about it), you are assuming the reader already have a very decent CRT monitor. Flat panels have been mainstream for quite a few years and there are probably a lot of aging panels out there. (which you are probably comparing your CRT monitor with..)</div></div><hr />

Well If you check the cards out, the only reason they are radeon is because they are good value and performance. GTX460 is a bang for its buck, Most GTX460 are OC to 470's Specs, or even surpasses it in some brands, so GTX470 isnt even a choice, ever. Then you got the radeon 5870 and 6 Series which is better then the GTX460 and 470. If you wanna go above Radeons High end 5 series and 6 Series Value to nvidia, you are paying $500 - 800 for the GTX480 and 580 Cards. Thats why its Radeon cards, like i said Value and performance. Not bias either, as my card is the GTX460.</div></div><hr />

Granted, this is the only build I looked at, I'm sure the other three are equally as bad.<br />
<br />
Allow me to elaborate for you, Boub:<br />
<br />
Case: is fine.<br />
PSU: is overkill, but is relatively fine.<br />
CPU: The 930 is out-dated. The 950 can be had for the same (or lower) price, and is better,<br />
Cooling: I will give chaud credit here. He single-handedly picked the worst air cooling solution you could possibly get at that price point. If you don't want water, you have many other (much, much better) choices. Noctua NH-D14, Thermalright Silver Arrow, etc. Or if you want a low profile closed-loop system for simple CPU cooling, something like a Corsair H50 or H70 would be perfect.<br />
Mobo: This one is debatable, but I'd much rather have an ASUS Rampage III Formula or something, many more features targeted to the gamer population, better board overall.<br />
Memory: That memory is absolute trash. 9 cas latency? Really? Those timings are horrendous. You can get kits for the same price or cheaper that have much, MUCH tighter timings-- like 6 or 7 CL.<br />
Video: This &quot;high-end&quot; build and you pick a HD 5870? What is the point of that? Drop another $150 and get a MUCH better card, a GTX 580.<br />
HDD: The Caviar Greens are alright but the Caviar Blacks are a couple dollars more and much better. This is a &quot;high-end&quot; rig afterall, isn't it?<br />
SSD: Wow, two decent SSDs. Got something right.<br />
<br />
I just hope someone with some money to blow doesn't see the system in the news post and goes out to Amazon and wastes their money on a sub-par system. If anyone here wants to actually get the best mileage out of their dollar and have much better performance, you can PM me here. Give me your budget and I'll walk you through a good build-- just please don't build anything you see on this news post.<br />
<br />
I am going to agree with you. Most of the recommended equipment is trash, not worth it or risky to purchase. The high end video card right now is GTX 580 and until GTX 595 comes out (which will literally dominate for a long while). The high end mouse is stupid garbage ... Razer Naga for a high end mouse. Did that guy even do his homework before recommending these products? Razer Naga IS the mouse for WoW. I can go on and on and on ... but I had to register this because I want a response back from MMO-Champion's admins:<br />
<br />
You guys have teamed up with Curse.com, right? What the hell is going on with curse.com? It has been down for more than a week now. I keep trying to refresh the page. I did on FF and IE and I tried on other computers and other internet connections. I mean, this is nuts man. I know curse.com is famous but do they even have reliable servers to start with?

Dunno what crt monitor you used, but atm crt monitors are pretty much on par with any led or lcd monitor.

<br />
I think I know what he means. Besides I would agree I bought my computer and put it all together for cheaper 2 months ago, prices of a build similar to above the average posted one. I built my system and with a 28&quot; 1920x1200 Hanns-G screen all for about 1200-1300, and that's getting all the parts OS not included. I have followed prices since and my build would be like $150 cheaper now. Only thing my comp lacks from those listed is more GPU memory. As far as a WoW player should be concerned my build runs everything at ultra except shading.<br />
<br />
Then again if its pre-built then I guess those prices would be reasonable for most people then since there is quite a process of getting it all together, although it isn't hard to either. I'd mainly argue with prices, high-end is above what WoW needs I am pretty sure.<br />

What's with the video card bias toward radeon? Some of us prefer nvidia over radeon for a multitude of reasons.<br />
<br />
Nvidia also dropped prices on most of their cards buy 40-60%, so no need for bias anymore either, the prices are matched and Nvidia has always amazed me more than Radeon, sorry.<br />

Storage choices were legit I wont say much for the rest, though don't exaggerate too much, it could be worse, but still as a recommendation it really isn't good builds for most of them.<br />
<br />
I am sure most of those builds for lower ends could actually be a bit cheaper, average definitely overpriced by a couple hundred (a good avg comp atm would be ~$1000, not to far above it either) as many can attest to, the top end build doesn't seem to be impressive, but for a WoW player its not like they would need much out of high end, the extra performance would be negligible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's true, they have come a long way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not sure what's what when it comes to monitors, but when you get to 1920x1080, at that point only screen size upgrades anything, doesn't it? The other point is that when you build a new computer, you NEED all those components as it is. There's no reason to right away go for a +$60 keyboard when you can just get a cheapie $15 basic one. Considering it &quot;Something that can be upgraded later.&quot; While the other parts can, things like monitors/keyboard/mouse are way easier to replace/upgrade, and at that point it's purely optional.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll be fine tanking and the armor contribution from gear should be sufficient enough to make you equivalent with the other tanks. Bears took a big hit a long while back. The armor base on equipment is very high (inflated to put it in other words).<br />

<br />
The 5970 is faster (sometimes) because it's a dual-GPU card. Thus you need to rely heavily on drivers and CrossFireX profiles. I'm not an Nvidia or AMD fanboy, but right now, the GTX 580 is the best single-GPU card in the world. The 6970 and 6990 are going to be awesome, no doubt. Of course, the 6990 will be another dual-GPU solutions-- but this time, Nvidia has one on the way as well. The ultimate battle in 2011 will be the GTX 595 vs. the HD 6990.</div></div><hr />

I must concur with many of the posters here. You made a few poor choices with your Advanced Rig design. It may benefit you to get your research from more than one website. &quot;Anandtech&quot; is decent, but I personally find &quot;tomshardware&quot; to be a bit more thourough.  The benchmarks are more detailed, and they review a much wider assortment of components. I could not find a CPU cooler review on anandtech which is no wonder why you chose the one you did.<br />
<br />
What you though you designed: Lowest, Low, Average, Highend<br />
What you actually designed: Lowest, Low, Average, slightly above average.<br />
You started to touch on High End, but did not realy get there. There is a wide range of options available for a true high end system, that do not even get into the Extreme level.<br />
<br />
It probably would have been better for you to find someone elses rig design and just link it. While I personally would not go with all these specific components. &quot;Tomshardware&quot; has recommended configuration systems for gaming at sub 1k and sub 2k price levels. They are equally as good as the ones listed here. Minus maybe the SSD.<br />
<br />
The Budget Intel based system that runs $450 cheaper and has similar CPU and Ram numbers. There is a link there to their high end under 2k rig as well. Certainly there are a few changes that I would make to both those designes were they for my personal use but their high end is $300 lower and will probably run very similar to your configuration.<br />
<br />
Unless Curse/MMO-Champion is getting some kind of kickback from Amazon, you probably should get your pricing from more than one location. Newegg is a great choice. You might also try &quot;Pricewatch&quot; Often the Amazon and Newegg prices are both listed so you get the best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
Maybe I am frequenting the wrong websites, but when I think of High End I think of<br />
CPU: i7-950<br />
Motherboard: Asus Rampage III<br />
Ram: 12gig of G.Skill Ripsaw with a CAS latency of 7<br />
Drive: Props to your Corsair Force choice. I can't justify the upgrade yet, the sandforce wasn't available when I got my intel X25-M, and for gaming its all about the read times.<br />
Video: For single cards the 5870s are good but I would have recomended a 2gig version. I would expect, however, for a high end rig to be running 2 cards with Cross Fire or a GTX 580<br />

High End for me is in the upper $2k boardering on $3k range. Extreme of course goes well beyond that to include Extreme i7-980x CPUs and other such insainly priced items.<br />
You can certainly get one heck of a nice system to game with under $2k or around $2k, but don't call it high end.<br />

A gaming rig is not an average computer that runs games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ladies and gentlemen we have the winner here.<br />
<br />
If you notice all the links to items go through Amazon.com. As a REFERRER MMO-Champ gets a % of the amount of dollars spent on each click through, more click throughs, more purchases the site gets a cut of the $$$ spent. Newegg doesn't offer this type of kickback even through their products offer 10x more variety and a vastly better price point. <br />
<br />
No this is no real conspiracy it's all about the $$$ and I applaud the site for pulling it off in the form of content even though it's a sham.<br />
<br />
This is the LAST place I'd trust to tell me what video card to put in my machine or what CPU to run on my machine. Go to a dedicated site like [H]ardOCP, Overclockers, Anandtech, TomsHardware, or even CyberPowerPC. A World of Warcraft news and content site to tell me what is the &quot;best&quot; monitor to install for maximum performance? No thank you.<br />
<br />
I give the site an A for effort on this one.<br />
<br />

If I were building a $2600 system and not $2220 the hardware selections would have been different.<br />

Purchasing an i3 might be an alternative if you play no other games that use more than two cores and do no tasks that would benefit from more cores. <br />

Razer Naga IS the mouse for WoW. <br />
While it is a nice mouse, it is certainly not for everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't see why the Intel i7 930 is liste as high end when you can get the AMD Phenom II x6 1090 Black Edition for less and it's about as fast as the Intel i7 980<br />
It doesn't really make a difference and it is not about as fast as the 980.<br />
http://i.imgur.com/pgUMf.png http://i.imgur.com/pmFZN.png<br />
<br />
<br />
The high end build chad came up with is absolutely horrid, 5870 is not high end, ati 5970 OR nvidia 580 is.<br />
<br />
Why did he chose 2 ssds? seriously nobody wants to use two DIFFERENT ssds. <br />
http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227659&amp;cm_re=revodrive_x2-_-20-227-659-_-Product should be the SSD on the list or the version one if ur cheap.<br />
<br />
As far as the cooler goes it should be the Noatua NH-d14 OR Corsair H50.<br />
<br />
And a IPS panel screen now that is just retarded and probably the best way to waste a lot of money.<br />
The 580 is ~ $200 more, if I were selecting parts for a $2400 build I would have selected it. The 5970 is a dual GPU card and ~$400 more.<br />
Please realize that the final price includes only one SSD. They are there as options to select from, as is the monitor.<br />
<br />
<br />
It may benefit you to get your research from more than one website. &quot;Anandtech&quot; is decent, but I personally find &quot;tomshardware&quot; to be a bit more thourough. The benchmarks are more detailed, and they review a much wider assortment of components. I could not find a CPU cooler review on anandtech which is no wonder why you chose the one you did.<br />
<br />
What you though you designed: Lowest, Low, Average, Highend<br />
What you actually designed: Lowest, Low, Average, slightly above average.<br />
You started to touch on High End, but did not realy get there. There is a wide range of options available for a true high end system, that do not even get into the Extreme level.<br />
<br />
Tomshardware is not an optimal place to look at reviews and the bias was even worse a few years ago (http://scientiasblog.blogspot.com/2006/09/toms-hardware-guide-sells-its-soul.html), I'll leave it at that. I am sorry you take issue with the selected names, I know it is possible to spend more and build a higher end system however.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Budget Intel based system that runs $450 cheaper and has similar CPU and Ram numbers. There is a link there to their high end under 2k rig as well. Certainly there are a few changes that I would make to both those designes were they for my personal use but their high end is $300 lower and will probably run very similar to your configuration.<br />
Hopefully you are talking about this build (http://www.tomshardware.com/system-configuration-recommendation-54.html). Not sure why they have a $50 slim DVD burnder in a budget build. The two years extra warranty on the Caviar Black is worth it at the price level I selected for. If we go ahead and remove the components that were in my build and not that one (Monitor, Keyboard, Mouse, Speakers) the build I selected is $19 more and I have a heatsink!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do realize that its optional but when someone who dont know anything about hardware reads this he will be all like mmo-champion put these items on the list so I need to get them.<br />
<br />
Under your Lower end system you wrote something along the lines of: XFX 6850 or GTX 460, you should do that under the High end system too with the SSDs so people will understand that you should not get both.<br />
<br />
About the screen, I still dont think that screen deserves a spot on the list, yes its a great screen (they got those on my school) but a 120 Hz screen would fit far better for gaming pc and would allow for a better gfx on the list (hint nvidia 580 or ati 5970) for the same price.<br />
Now that we are talking about gfx im not sure what you are on about with the 400 extra dollars for the ati 5970 on http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814102887&amp;cm_re=5970-_-14-102-887-_-Product you can get the 5970 for 500 dollars while the nvidia 580 costs arround 530 dollars, im sugesting these two because we all know there are some people out there who heard from their friends or colleges that ati/nvidia sucks.</div></div><hr />

Thus you need to rely heavily on drivers and CrossFireX profiles. I'm not an Nvidia or AMD fanboy, but right now, the GTX 580 is the best single-GPU card in the world. The 6970 and 6990 are going to be awesome, no doubt. Of course, the 6990 will be another dual-GPU solutions-- but this time, Nvidia has one on the way as well. The ultimate battle in 2011 will be the GTX 595 vs. the HD 6990.<br />
<br />
The 5970 is faster because of the dual-GPU, but do you even know what type of GPU's they're using? Might wanna check the Internet to see what's inside your graphic card. Besides that, ATI doesn't have PhysX or CUDA technology. No arguing here at all. I'm just pointing out some facts. The GTX 590/595 series will sport two of the GTX 580's GPU's on a single card. No one is going to sit here and say any of the ATI cards can match this monster. They're waiting to release this beast in the first months of 2011.<br />
<br />
I want to purchase the GTX 560. Two of those cards will be oh-so-sufficient to play other high-end games at maximum graphics.<br />
<br />
The two cards I currently have are 2x 8800 GT Superclocked and I have SLI-enabled. I couldn't get my multisampling over 2x without lagging and my Texture Filtering was at either 1x or 4x and any higher would hinder my gameplay. Sitting in Dalaran would give me an average of 25 or 30ish FPS. As soon as I learned about PhysX, I dedicated my second card to it. I gained about 10-15 FPS increase. I notched my multisampling to 8x (which was the max) and texture filtering at x16 and I put everything on the highest graphics available with the exception of Shadows (WoW's shadows are irritating and stupid). I sat in Dalaran in the heaviest days of its traffic and was either around 40 FPS or 50 FPS with ZERO lag input. I had no tearing. My screen Never froze. Seriously? For a 8800 GT? I started laughing and since then I love nVidia. Besides that, EVGA are superb graphic makers. I love them.<br />

Bears took a big hit a long while back. The armor base on equipment is very high (inflated to put it in other words).<br />
<br />
This is just untrue.<br />
<br />
Right now Blood Presence adds about 3k armor, less than half the amount of armor added by an equivalent shield.<br />
Going from T10 to T11 gear the plate armor gains about 4k armor, shields on the other hand increase in armor by 4.5k alone, an 8k difference in armor is huge.<br />
<br />
So right now DKs are about 4k armor behind equivalent tanks.<br />
At 85 DKs will gain about 5k armor, warriors and paladins will gain about 9.5k making the gap even bigger.<br />
<br />
This will mean DKs will be taking a lot more damage than other tanks (even before you factor block into the equation). Block is a fantastic stat, it is passive damage mitigation and as years of stamina and armor spamming have shown passive mitigation wins out over everything else. Being able to self heal is no good because it is only of real use when you wouldn't have died anyway and since DKs will be taking bigger hits than anyone else due to having a lot less armor than other tanks the odds of getting killed by a damage spike are a lot higher.<br />
<br />
Being the tank that takes the most damage and also takes the spikiest damage but can heal some of it back is not a viable niche. The purpose of a tank is to not take damage. Theres a reason you don't see holy paladins tanking, all the heals in the world won't make up for the fact that they are taking more damage than the other tanks and DKs are being pushed into some sort of hybrid Tank/Healer that is somewhere between a Real Tank and a Healer. It just won't work.<br />
<br />
Put it this way, which would you prefer, a tank that took 10% less damage or a tank that took 10% increased healing?</div></div><hr />

Granted, this is the only build I looked at, I'm sure the other three are equally as bad.<br />
<br />
Allow me to elaborate for you, Boub:<br />
<br />
Case: is fine.<br />
PSU: is overkill, but is relatively fine.<br />
CPU: The 930 is out-dated. The 950 can be had for the same (or lower) price, and is better,<br />
Cooling: I will give chaud credit here. He single-handedly picked the worst air cooling solution you could possibly get at that price point. If you don't want water, you have many other (much, much better) choices. Noctua NH-D14, Thermalright Silver Arrow, etc. Or if you want a low profile closed-loop system for simple CPU cooling, something like a Corsair H50 or H70 would be perfect.<br />
Mobo: This one is debatable, but I'd much rather have an ASUS Rampage III Formula or something, many more features targeted to the gamer population, better board overall.<br />
Memory: That memory is absolute trash. 9 cas latency? Really? Those timings are horrendous. You can get kits for the same price or cheaper that have much, MUCH tighter timings-- like 6 or 7 CL.<br />
Video: This &quot;high-end&quot; build and you pick a HD 5870? What is the point of that? Drop another $150 and get a MUCH better card, a GTX 580.<br />
HDD: The Caviar Greens are alright but the Caviar Blacks are a couple dollars more and much better. This is a &quot;high-end&quot; rig afterall, isn't it?<br />
SSD: Wow, two decent SSDs. Got something right.<br />
<br />
I just hope someone with some money to blow doesn't see the system in the news post and goes out to Amazon and wastes their money on a sub-par system. If anyone here wants to actually get the best mileage out of their dollar and have much better performance, you can PM me here. Give me your budget and I'll walk you through a good build-- just please don't build anything you see on this news post.<br />

First of all, who the audience? People who would build their own computers really should have no problem figuring out which components they want based on the features, budget, benchmarks, and manufacturer preferences. The kind of people who can't make that determination probably shouldn't be trying to build their own computer (which makes a list of components rather useless). Those people would benefit far more from reviews of PCs sold by Alienware, Cyberpower, or Systemax for example. <br />

<br />
2. Well, it's still a WoW news site.<br />
<br /> 
3. Mostly using Amazon because it works everywhere. Newegg is cheaper but only works in the US, I'm not really in the mood to tell 60% of my users who do not live in the US to GTFO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With higher graphic settings come higher memory usage, and it was easily realistic to reach a 2GB commit charge in populated areas (ie. Dalaran).<br />
For those unaware, reaching this point causes the game to crash.<br />
The only solution was/is to tone down the graphic settings, particularly shadows.<br />
<br />
With all this discussion about system upgrades (to play WoW?), I figured it would be appropriate for people to be forewarned about the limitations of WoW because it is still a 32bit program and will likely not change at any point through out the upcoming expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
My build: Intel i7 920 (overclocked to 4GHz), Scythe Mugen Rev.B, XFX HD 5870 (stock clocks), Mushkin Enhanced Redline 6GB DDR3 1600, Gigabyte X58A-UD3R, Western Digital 1TB Caviar Black, Cooler Master HAF932.<br />
<br />
At the time of my build, Nvidia had not released their new 400 and 500 series cards, let alone I could not even find a seller with a 280gtx or better in stock.<br />
ATI/AMD have good cards but they lack the driver support that Nvidia has for their own; which makes a significant difference and should be considered before you purchase either brand.</div></div><hr />

It will always be hotly contested over certain aspects eg the graphics cards: If you think alliance vs horde is bad you should see what PC hardware nuts get up to in ATI vs Nvidia flamewars. <br />
<br />
I'd suggest you get a decent hardware site to offer you some deals and get a couple of your people to talk to them about what you'd like offered and prices etc.<br />
<br />
A lot of folks will look at the extra's included in the specs and assume it's way beyond their price range, have them in a seperate area. You can build a decent rig for around $500 if you aren't after super, amazing parts (which most people aren't, they just want a PC that works).</div></div><hr />

Chaud, I really appreciate what you're trying to do for the community, people definitely need some reliable advice on computer parts. However, I'm going to stop you right here before you embarrass yourself anymore... some of your part recommendations really are very ill-advised, and your math skills need a lot of work.<br />
<br />
You have the high end total listed as $2210, but a simple calculator can tell you that the total is $2519. That's not a measly difference, the parts you recommended cost considerably more that listed total and for that price they're really not worth it (except a few that other's have pointed out. I myself want to thank you for bringing the Corsair Force F120 to my attention... it's amazing!)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hope this segment remains as a part of MMO-Champ, but I really hope you guys put more research effort into the choices next time. I don't mind the amazon advertising, you guys should get something for all your hard work.<br />

To be brief, all the shopping SHOULD have been done from Newegg, these prices are bad but if you're from out of country it's understandable. However that doesn't argue the point of bad configurations for these desktops.. My question would be why my config that ran me a total of $1200 barely gets outperformed by your lower priced high-end build. I have:<br />
<br />
Intel Core2QuadExtreme QX6850<br />
6gb PC8000 Mushkin Red<br />
Gigabyte P40 motherboard<br />
Arctic Cool 7 Heat Sink<br />
JBL 2.1 Speakers<br />
Logitech G5<br />
Logitech G110<br />
Antec 900 Case<br />
Thermaltake Black Widow 850W PS<br />
XFX ATI Radeon 4890 1GB DDR5<br />
Samsung SATA Dual Layer DVD burner<br />
WD Caviar Black 750/640 and Caviar Blue 320<br />
Gateway 22&quot; 1680x1050 HDMI/DVI/VGA/Component Hookups<br />
<br />
This rig ran me probably less than the stated $1200 3 years ago. It defeats both of your beginning builds and you favored Intel in your higher end builds? I'm lost as to whether or not you realize the potential of an AMD Black series processor with Vision technology. These processors give you ridiculous out of the box performance paired with just ONE ATI card. AMD also has the only true 6 core processor. Intel's i7 series is quad cores with hyper threading simulating octacores. Something tells me you need to do some more research on the computer hardware scene cause I could go by a BBY and buy a $630 AMD Quad core HP desktop, put in a new power supply, a new graphics card, and beat your first 3 options. The solid state hard drive is nice but Intel is one of the best to go with right now in the market of SSD. There's also no need for more than 1 SSD for those of you reading some of these setups, you should get 1 decent size SSD and put your Windows and your MOST USED/FAVORITE programs on it. All media and other programs and objects should be stored on a good ol' SATA. <br />
<br />
I hate to say you should put someone else in command of this custom build section cause I could build much better setups that would run WoW AMAZING for less prices. <br />
<br />
Not that I've browsed previous posts but where was any inclination of the included $200 OS?<br />

I agree- it seems like he put together a list assorted by price and not by quality. The AMD Phenom II X6 Thuban Black Edition (3.2GHz) is an amazing processor, and from what I read it JUST falls short of the highest Core i7, its also about 500 dollars cheaper. For any gamer, they are the same damn thing. <br />

I honestly feel like any peripherals shouldn't be considered in the price tag for these computers, given that most people trying to save are simply going to use the same monitor, keyboard etc. that they've always used--plus it's not like there's any decision making with those parts. Unless you're trying to dual-screen, what monitor, mouse etc. you are using simply doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

Take a look at the links, they're all referral links for curse... I'm a fan of mmo-champion, read daily, but that's pretty misleading, and very manipulative.<br />

Please don't invent numbers. In almost any situation it is not even as good as the i7 950. It is a great buy if you do the few activities that can actually use more cores though.<br />

Ignoring your fabricated price, and your AMD marketing speak, let's take a look at your claim that Intel has no 6 core processors. Taking a quick trip to any tech related website, you may learn that Intel does in fact produce 6 core CPUs. You can read a review of the first one here (http://www.anandtech.com/show/2960). They are an awful value, which is why they were not used in any build. <br />
<br />
Moving on, let's take a look at your claim that Intel is in fact the king of the SSD market! Surely they will be good at reading large seq files!<br />
http://images.anandtech.com/graphs/oczvertex2_042810130947/22700.png <br />
<br />
Oh well, middle of the pack is better than last! Let's go ahead and take a look at writes...<br />
<br />
http://i.imgur.com/m8Qpb.png<br />
<br />
Well, at least they didn't fall off of the chart. Although the 80gb almost lost to a hybrid mechanical drive. Looking at writes again...<br />
<br />
http://i.imgur.com/jPn8e.png<br />
<br />
Middle of the pack, yay! Let's go ahead and look at the price. The 80gb Intel G2 costs...$205! $2.56/GB. The Corsair Force 120GB costs...$230! $1.91/GB. <br />
<br />
Not sure why you would buy both SSDs listed, hopefully you can figure out there are two options to select from.<br />
<br />
You appear to be uninformed and spouting AMD marketing. Please read up on the current offerings instead of inventing numbers and prices for your old box.<br />
<br />
Just for fun, let's take a look at your Best Buy claims. I went ahead and found a $680 HP Desktop (http://www.bestbuy.com/site/HP+Pavilion+p6654y+Desktop+%26+20%22+LCD+Monitor+Package/9999139100050005.p?id=pcmprd139100050005&amp;skuId=9999139100050005) on BestBuy.com <br />
<br />
Let's go ahead and add the 650TX at $55, your choice of GPU at $200, and we are at $935. Comparing this to the $1,050 build, you have a smaller monitor, weaker CPU, generic mobo, smaller hard drive, a cheap keyboard/mouse, no speakers, and a one year warranty.<br />
<br />
What a deal!<br />
<br />
<br />
Using Left for Dead as a metric IS inventing numbers. Games are built using different compilers, some of which use command sets that give a decided advantage to Intel based architecture. <br />
<br />
Even if that wasn't the case, you are using a CPU and comparing it to a GPU putting out FPS... that is hardly a fair metric.<br />
<br />
What benchmark would you consider fair? I was unable to find any World of Warcraft benchmark that included this CPU.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kraszmyl</div><div class="date">2010-11-26, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with basicly everyone else on these pages. Your parts choices are terrible beyond belief. Even the parts you do choose that are decent can be found cheaper elsewhere on average. <br />
<br />
You can easily build a computer that could run wow maxed out in nearly all situations on that moniter you picked on your so called low end build for considerably less.<br />
<br />
Prime example would be my spare laptop. <br />
<br />
It runs a i7 1.6gz quad and a 5730. It manages to run wow maxed minus AA at 1366x786 at about 35-60fps. In the desktop world my 5730 is about onpar with 4650 or even a ddr5 5550 if i recall correctly and the reason the cpu does so well is since wow doesnt use more than two cores it just uses turbo boost to kill two cores and jump the remaining two to about 2.6ghz.<br />
<br />
So thats near 50$ you can knock off the cpu right there by droping to a dual core and 70$ or more you can ditch on the video card even moving to a 5670 without even going over the rest of the setup.<br />
<br />
For your high end build lets use my desktop which should make a good example.<br />
<br />
i7-870 , 16 gigs of ram, dual 6850s and four 28inch 1920x1200 displays setup in eyefinity.<br />
<br />
Ive yet to ever see it move from the 60fps its capped at and thats also running multiple instances of wow full on and windowed.<br />
<br />
Infact my old gtx460 never reported more than 30 percent gpu utilization with wow maxed running windowed on a single 1920x1200 display , granted it did eat like 700 megs of vram.<br />
<br />
So discounting my extra displays and my piles of hard drives my rig comes in cheaper than your high end and is more power efficent with less heat output and yours would would eat its dust in gaming.<br />
<br />
Actualy youre poor suggestions got me curious and i loaded wow on my ancient dual socket p4 workstation and shoved a 8800gts640 in it and hmmmm actualy it runs wow ratherwell on high settings with AA and shadows off.....then i got even more curious and put the orriginal quadro fx1300 card back in and sitting in dal it was getting 27fps with everything on low and that quadro card is worse than the amd igps at this point. Actualy id get you the numbers for a 4200igp except my roommate is using that computer.<br />
<br />
Said roommates comp i built out of spare crap, phenom 2 dual core (i wanted to try and play with core unlocking, i was sadly unlucky) with a 4870 and he can run wow almost maxed and its very playable on a 1920x1080 lcd, he just has to drop shadows as far as im aware.<br />
<br />
Anyway point of it is. Terrible terrible choices on your part for parts selection and where youre getting them for prices.</div></div><hr />

Yes you can build a $2 toaster that can run WoW, these builds are for general gaming. Would another really cheap build satisfy you?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">talonp</div><div class="date">2010-11-26, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can I suggest that before you post the next &quot;build of the month&quot; or whatever, that you come over to OCN (overclock.net) and post the build in the appropriate forum (Intel General vs AMD General)?<br />
<br />
Simply name the budget and what you want to do with it (gaming). There will be plenty of people who, including myself, will happily chime in, find the weak points, and offer suitable alternatives. I appreciate that you are trying to help people come up with components; however, the titles of each set are very misleading. Now, you clearly are not a dumbass. I apologize if my post on the first page sounded harsh, but when it comes to people dropping serious amount of real money, they need to first be sufficiently informed. I felt that the builds in the news post had some serious flaws, and there was tons of improvements to be made. This includes components that could be upgraded for a little more money and for a lot more performance gain, and also, alternative pieces that are even cheaper and perform even better.<br />
<br />
I spend hours on OCN every day (my company wouldn't be very enthused to know :p) participating in discussions with hundreds of some very hardcore enthusiasts. It's a tremendously awesome community, and we would be more than happy to collaborate with you guys before you go giving tens of thousands of people the green light to drop thousands of dollars. While I know you're competent (chaud), it can never hurt to have more than a few people collaborate on something like this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kraszmyl</div><div class="date">2010-11-26, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you seriously didnt just compared a gtx460 to a 4870, they are worlds apart.<br />
<br />
Also a 5670 is more than capable of playing just about anything at 1680x1050 on highish settings at 30-50fps average except metro 2033 and avp in dx11 modes. So ya its fine for a general build too. Very few games use more than two cores and unless youre doing some sort of simulations, vm work and other equivelent things youre not going to miss those extra two cores outside of gaming either.<br />
<br />
So ya even for general gaming your builds are terrible and perhaps you should listen to the rest of us who own these products if youre still stuck with that 4870. You did a poor job, just accept the flak with abit of grace and be done with it.</div></div><hr />

Now, I won't even begin to pretend my computer is some amazing super computer...but I would say he's a little off the mark on pricing. An average computer for over $1400? I have a Gateway DX-4200-09 that I bought like in January of 2009 for just over $600 (including a 19 inch LG monitor). The only upgrade I've done to it is I spent about $150 to upgrade the power supply to a 500W and added an Nvidia 450 GTS. (I also paid about $35 for a more capable mouse). You could do very comparable for under $800 as well and I can run WoW at ultra and at 60 fps everywhere (Dal, org, raids, everywhere). But yet, somehow, price wise, my computer ranks below his &quot;lower-end&quot; computer. I know some people want more, and that's nice, but I'm very certain my computer, as is, is above the average player's computer. I'm not saying you should buy a stock model, I just wasn't in to do it yourself computer stuff last year and I've moved more towards it this year. My next computer will be build it yourself. But if you're seriously gonna spend $1400 for a gaming pc, you can basically cut that in half and still run nearly any game at it's highest level.</div></div><hr />

Ignoring your fabricated price, and your AMD marketing speak, let's take a look at your claim that Intel has no 6 core processors. Taking a quick trip to any tech related website, you may learn that Intel does in fact produce 6 core CPUs. You can read a review of the first one here (http://www.anandtech.com/show/2960). They are an awful value, which is why they were not used in any build. <br />

<br />
Not sure why you would buy both SSDs listed, hopefully you can figure out there are two options to select from.<br />

<br />
Let's go ahead and add the 650TX at $55, your choice of GPU at $200, and we are at $935. Comparing this to the $1,050 build, you have a smaller monitor, weaker CPU, generic mobo, smaller hard drive, a cheap keyboard/mouse, no speakers, and a one year warranty.<br />
<br />
What a deal!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What benchmark would you consider fair? I was unable to find any World of Warcraft benchmark that included this CPU.<br />
<br />
You're missing the point. Right now your list looks like you went to amazon did a search for most expensive then went down the line. Its not about price, its about performance vs price. We could all blow a ton of cash and build a unit or we could build a great pc for 1/3 the cost. <br />
<br />
Also you listings make no sense. Low end should be super cheap but can run wow. And your top end should be the best of the best. I honestly have no idea what &quot;average&quot; means with your lists.</div></div><hr />

Granted, this is the only build I looked at, I'm sure the other three are equally as bad.<br />
<br />
Allow me to elaborate for you, Boub:<br />
<br />
Case: is fine.<br />
PSU: is overkill, but is relatively fine.<br />
CPU: The 930 is out-dated. The 950 can be had for the same (or lower) price, and is better,<br />
Cooling: I will give chaud credit here. He single-handedly picked the worst air cooling solution you could possibly get at that price point. If you don't want water, you have many other (much, much better) choices. Noctua NH-D14, Thermalright Silver Arrow, etc. Or if you want a low profile closed-loop system for simple CPU cooling, something like a Corsair H50 or H70 would be perfect.<br />
Mobo: This one is debatable, but I'd much rather have an ASUS Rampage III Formula or something, many more features targeted to the gamer population, better board overall.<br />
Memory: That memory is absolute trash. 9 cas latency? Really? Those timings are horrendous. You can get kits for the same price or cheaper that have much, MUCH tighter timings-- like 6 or 7 CL.<br />
Video: This &quot;high-end&quot; build and you pick a HD 5870? What is the point of that? Drop another $150 and get a MUCH better card, a GTX 580.<br />
HDD: The Caviar Greens are alright but the Caviar Blacks are a couple dollars more and much better. This is a &quot;high-end&quot; rig afterall, isn't it?<br />
SSD: Wow, two decent SSDs. Got something right.<br />
<br />
I just hope someone with some money to blow doesn't see the system in the news post and goes out to Amazon and wastes their money on a sub-par system. If anyone here wants to actually get the best mileage out of their dollar and have much better performance, you can PM me here. Give me your budget and I'll walk you through a good build-- just please don't build anything you see on this news post.<br />
<br />
I agree with this, and pretty much most of the earlier posts made in this thread.<br />
<br />
While, when building a custom gaming system, it comes down to preference between manufacture. In all honesty you shouldn't recommend any high-end gaming builds unless you got your facts straight and with some hard benchmarking results to back up your choice, seriously the &quot;Chaud&quot; guy just seem like he was given a budget for each build, and just randomly picked out parts from a website.<br />
<br />
But all that aside, I seriously think if you were going to recommend a build, keep it at ONE build that meets the criteria of &quot;AFFORDABILITY and being able to run World of Warcraft on moderate - high settings for the AVERAGE players&quot; and honestly don't recommend things like Keyboard/Mices/Monitor, most of those thing contributes very little to the gameplay of WoW to the AVERAGE user, and they are based highly on personal preference anyways. Don't get me wrong, I know some KB/Mices does change/improve your gameplay, but its a very small factor people think about when building their system. I say this because, most people who are on a budget, would willingly sacrifice these components to be able to afford a more expensive part inside the system.<br />
<br />
And seriously? $500 for a 24&quot; monitor? You might as well sacrifice some specs/features of the monitor and get a 27&quot;, or a triple display set up.<br />
<br />
Why do I say average users? 'cause lets me honest, most people who are willing to throw out a few thousands of dollars to build a custom high-end PC are people who are tech savvy and MOST LIKELY ISN'T going to go on a website like MMO-Champion for a wishlist. They would most likely be doing there own research anyways.<br />
<br />
anyways in short, keep to what you guys do best, providing information about World of Warcraft and Blizzard and leave the computer building to enthusiast who actually knows what they are doing.</div></div><hr />

Um sorry Chaud but look up the Intel Retail Edge that QX6850 was a FRACTION of that price =) Pays to be involved in the computer community. NONE THE LESS MY OBJECTIVE was to point out your options you've chosen do not have the customer in mind. If a customer wants the highest end PC without being 5k they'd go for a i7 950 and as of my 4890 that was $70 less at a local store thnx. My point was to state you didn't shop like a hardware savy person shops. We do massive research into each part and consider the gains and losses and you didn't really do the best bang for the buck for any of your first 3 options. The 4th build you listed is way overboard and should have been an AMD black so that the customer didn't have to consider future dual graphics cards cause of the Vision. <br />
<br />
And as of your BBY config, it wins. It beats your first 2 options, which neither had SSD hard drives on your argument point(Guess you didn't look at your own build configurations?) which you lose 250 compared to your 1tb but I guess all those people that multi-install WoW fully understand the need for ALLLLL that storage. Oh and that's right you've dodged that $200 Operating System bullet this whole time(Can't be a big deal right? Customer's problem.) I work with helping people get the right hardware for the cheapest price all the time and as of your generic HP mobo, that's the only thing you'd beat and that's cause you're that 1/5 people that realize Asus is a big name even though Gigabyte has taken the market for quality. All of my argument was about what the average human being would want(the best most reliable deal for the money). And btw it would pair up with the ATI card and outperform any nvidia/ati combo with an intel processor for that price range. Also as of listing processor benchmarks? Did you not realize that if 1/1000000000 people can step out of a void zone within 4 seconds, why is it you assume they'd have an interest in future overclocking? They'd want performance out of the box. Monitor wise...You REALLY think Asus is gonna be any better at monitors than HP's relisted sony/lg/samsung HP doesn't make that screen and look at one in person, it's sick quality. You could get a 23&quot; for like $80 more. If you wanted to pair GOOD monitors with your builds, consider the LG/Samsung line of new LEDs. Or if you're a sick perfectionist we all know ViewSonic is where the money is.<br />

Lol wow... you completely missed the point again. The post you quoted isn't asking for a lower build (In fact, no one in this entire thread has asked for any kind of build from you).<br />
<br />
The post that you quoted, is pointing out that your list makes no sense, and that your definition of a &quot;Lowest-End&quot; up towards &quot;High-End&quot; is completely off the mark, as most of the components you picked for each corresponding builds, were poorly chosen and doesn't fit into those &quot;build&quot; criteria, other than the price.<br />
<br />
Your &quot;Lowest-End&quot; build is overpriced. Your best &quot;High-End&quot; build is again.. overpriced and no where near the mark of what most people would consider a &quot;High-End&quot; system.<br />
<br />
<br />
... I can't make everyone happy! :p<br />
<br />
NO ONE is happy with ANY of your builds... next time at least show you put a bit of effort into researching your builds, and the definition of the build, before you (as someone has said) go wasting peoples money with your advices. Or.. don't give any at all.</div></div><hr />

Great idea, as others have said most people already have those parts, and/or will select them independent of the rest of the computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Using Left for Dead as a metric IS inventing numbers. Games are built using different compilers, some of which use command sets that give a decided advantage to Intel based architecture.<br />
While that's gibberish (I think he means &quot;built using different game engines&quot; ;)) he's right. For a WOW site, it would be nice to have a blurb about common WOW performance bottlenecks, and which parts (eg. 72-core CPUs) aren't utilized at all by WOW's game engine. But as Chaud pointed out, most people do play more games than just WOW.<br />
<br />
As evident by the fanboy arguments here, I think it'd be best to have 2 setups, one with AMD+ATI and one with Intel+Nvidia at each price range.<br />
<br />
It could also stand to be narrowed down to 2 price ranges, &quot;low end&quot; and &quot;midrange&quot;. Anyone spending the $ on real high-end isn't going to be using a guide like this to make their decisions.<br />
<br />
The guide also lacks an Operating System entirely. You could at least pretend to not be recommending pirated copies of Windows. It would also make for more honest comparison to pre-built computers that come with a legit copy of Windows.<br />
<br />
If you can find a referral program, I'd say include some pre-built barebones PCs in there. You can usually get a Dell or the like, with-OS, for the same or cheaper than building from parts. That also removes the need for PC building and troubleshooting (and pirating) skills, and is more reliable in general. The performance might take a small hit, but hardly worth mentioning. The CPU and GPU matter most, and you'll be getting the GPU (possibly RAM too) separate for those builds anyway.<br />
<br />
Only catch I've found is making sure the barebones pre-built PCs come with a 6-pin or 2x molex power. The last $400 Dell I got had only Sata power, so I had to get Sata-&gt;molex converters to put into the molex-&gt;6-pin converter to power the GPU. But that &quot;pathetic&quot; 400w PSU it came with runs my ATI 5750+AMD 7850 without a hitch, and it's way quieter+cooler than any homebuilt computer for anywhere near the $400(+$200 GPU=$600 total) price range.</div></div><hr />

Especially when you're paying $167 for a 22 inch monitor, and have some sort of weird preference with XFX graphics cards. $306/778 = 39% of your total cost in that lowest end portion are items that can be downgraded easily or different brands can be purchased at a discount.<br />
<br />
Also, without reading the replies of the thread I'm sure chaud is going to get reamed for having pretty poor &quot;high end&quot; decisions in terms of price / performance. Buying overpriced items just to force price ranges isn't good advice. $556 for a 24&quot; monitor, regardless of the panel, is unnecessary at the high end. I'd understand if you were going for a massively sized/priced build, etc.<br />
<br />
$200 motherboard? Again, is this looking at performance or &quot;frills&quot; when you're looking at topend. This is another piece that you could gain equal if not more performance from a substantially cheaper purchase.<br />
<br />
Also I'd be very careful about recommending solid state hard drives that are cheaper. They have very short lifespans and issues when full. The reason intels are far more expensive is due to technology that increases the lifespan and performance as the drive is full. There have been a plague of rave reviews for SSD drives that are literally revoked after a few months when the performance doesn't match up and you realize how/why you paid discount prices for being a relatively early adopter.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the goal is with these lists... generate linking revenue via sponsors? Was this something generally in demand? I don't want to squabble about a few % gain for cost, but you've presented us with 4 price points that have arbitrarily different performances. You could compress the price points and lessen the performance differences a lot. You could also vastly increase the price differences and emphasize performance differences. The missing portion here is how each of these actually perform.<br />
<br />
For the intended audience you don't really mention where the performance gains/losses are coming from, or how well each will run various games. Perhaps you should present a benchmark of 4 or 5 games at various resolutions for each of your systems, but I assume you haven't actually built any of these so the &quot;high and low&quot; ends refers to, again, arbitrary price points. Usually when real hardware sites refer to these builds, they have scientific proof to back it up.<br />
<br />
Since this is a wow site, you should AT THE VERY LEAST be providing estimates on how well wow will run, which you'll quickly find, there is a plateau of gains from buying system. You literally will gain nothing in terms of performance increase from wow on an older system, for wow ALL FOUR OF THESE are high end systems, unless maybe you multitask while rendering graphics in the background.<br />
<br />
If your intention is just to put up a bunch of $$$ generating links to amazon, I guess that's one way to do it. But as you've said, this isn't a hardware site so I don't think you can post these sorts of misinformed lists without receiving criticism.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It has been 100% stated on hardware sites across the board that the largest, most essential, upgrade you can make to your computer is investing in a solid state drive. If you take all 4 of those computers and run wow on it on a regular harddrive, you'll see roughly the same performance.<br />
<br />
But if you put an SSD in your $700 computer it will outperform your $2100 build without an SSD, and we're not talking about a few % here, we're talking about instant load times no matter the zone or the place, versus waiting to load.<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR: people come to this site as an authority on WoW. I don't think it is appropriate to feature these clearly non-authoritative bits of advice. We've seen more in depth reviews over *UI MODS* for heaven's sake, rattling off computer parts costing $THOUSANDS should warrant more than that. When the atlas loot ui section underneath your recommendations has more detail, you should know something's wrong.</div></div><hr />

Granted, this is the only build I looked at, I'm sure the other three are equally as bad.<br />
<br />
Allow me to elaborate for you, Boub:<br />
<br />
Case: is fine.<br />
PSU: is overkill, but is relatively fine.<br />
CPU: The 930 is out-dated. The 950 can be had for the same (or lower) price, and is better,<br />
Cooling: I will give chaud credit here. He single-handedly picked the worst air cooling solution you could possibly get at that price point. If you don't want water, you have many other (much, much better) choices. Noctua NH-D14, Thermalright Silver Arrow, etc. Or if you want a low profile closed-loop system for simple CPU cooling, something like a Corsair H50 or H70 would be perfect.<br />
Mobo: This one is debatable, but I'd much rather have an ASUS Rampage III Formula or something, many more features targeted to the gamer population, better board overall.<br />
Memory: That memory is absolute trash. 9 cas latency? Really? Those timings are horrendous. You can get kits for the same price or cheaper that have much, MUCH tighter timings-- like 6 or 7 CL.<br />
Video: This &quot;high-end&quot; build and you pick a HD 5870? What is the point of that? Drop another $150 and get a MUCH better card, a GTX 580.<br />
HDD: The Caviar Greens are alright but the Caviar Blacks are a couple dollars more and much better. This is a &quot;high-end&quot; rig afterall, isn't it?<br />
SSD: Wow, two decent SSDs. Got something right.<br />
<br />
I just hope someone with some money to blow doesn't see the system in the news post and goes out to Amazon and wastes their money on a sub-par system. If anyone here wants to actually get the best mileage out of their dollar and have much better performance, you can PM me here. Give me your budget and I'll walk you through a good build-- just please don't build anything you see on this news post.<br />
<br />
Hi I have about $3000 and i've pretty much decided on everything i want but was wondering what would be the best choice for memory and a cooling system thanks.</div></div><hr />

Those SSDs are excellent choices and the Intel drives are just slow and behind now, hopefully G3 will be impressive. I am not sure what you want me to do in terms of performance, I clearly don't have all these setups to run benchmarks on and hardly any sites use WoW for benchmarking. Making up very rough performance numbers is something I am not comfortable with. XFX cards are the only ones that come with a lifetime warranty. You clearly don't have a SSD, as load times are not instant everywhere.</div></div><hr />
