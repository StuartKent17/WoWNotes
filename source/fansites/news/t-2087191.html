Legion - Character Leveling Stats<br />
Today we are taking a look at the percentage of characters of each class that made it from being Level 100 a few months before Legion to Level 110 as of this week.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some characters were lost to name changes, realm transfers, faction changes, and database issues.<br />
The absolute percentages here have little meaning because of those issues, so they should only be used for comparing one class to another.<br />
Demon Hunters were not included, as the set of characters being checked was from a few months before the pre-expansion patch.<br />
We did the same thing during Mists of Pandaria (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3383-Character-Leveling-Stats-New-Video-Game-and-WoW-Forums-Blue-Tweets-Blizzard-Art) and Cataclysm (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2413-Character-Activity-Stats-Poll-Trip-to-Blizzcon-Contest-MMO-Report). Keep in mind that both of those were later into the expansion. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
BlizzCon<br />
One of the cool things about a content-heavy patch cycle is that there is always fun stuff to talk about at Blizzcon (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/782964181028921345))<br />
<br />
Future Content<br />
At this point in your Legion progression, what sort of content would you most like to see added? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/782962079707729920))<br />
Brawlers guild with new bosses, legion spaceship I can use to explore the universe and planets to conquer with my followers<br />
you sound EXACTLY like Sargeras right now (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/782964331122036736))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Seeing the post on reddit in which you basically say that LFR is the worst design decision you've ever made, I'm wondering what was the idea/mindset behind making it? To allow people who aren't that good at the game to experience raiding?<br />
Yeah I expanded a little in that answer. I said that the goal of getting players with less time or willingness to wipe for 3 hours into raiding was a noble goal. Raiding is fun. It's the most epic part of the game IMHO. A lot of storytelling happens in raids and you get to see some great art and interact with famous characters. We definitely spent a lot of dev time on raiding, so getting it accessible to a larger population made sense.<br />
<br />
The problem with Raid Finder was that when the content was too tough (meaning easier than normal raiding, but not a cake walk) then people would tend to drop the raid after a wipe or two. You'd get these revolving doors where the raid itself was stuck on a boss but the individuals in the raid had cycled through maybe 100s of players after a few hours. There was no &quot;Okay, boys and girls, let's call it a night,&quot; moment that you get from a raid leader in an organized guild. For that matter, there was no leader who could kick problem players, dictate strategy or explain the fights. For most players, Raid Finder was a weirdly silent and anonymous affair.<br />
<br />
The altenative was to make the difficulty level so easy that you'd probably steamroll every boss and that's sort of where we ended up, but it meant you weren't really doing a rotation, lots of people were AFK and these famous bosses hit like kittens.<br />
<br />
Daelo (Scott Mercer) was the other designer who worked with me on Raid Finder, and if I had to do it all over again, I think I would advocate we try something more like a group builder where a leader would invite (and be able to kick) people. I did a lot of pug raiding over the years, and some of them worked fine, which leads me to believe that model has promise. I *think* WoW has something like that now? Not sure.<br />
<br />
I have a lot of faith in those guys. They will eventually figure out a good solution if they haven't already. The original question and answer were both targeting my career as a designer, not an attempt to take a shot at WoW.<br />

Eh, its a blast to play. Especially WW. It is simply a newer class that has always been seen as difficult to play. Not to mention the fantasy is kind of hit or miss for people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah Monk has never really been OP enough to draw in fotm rerolls, and way too much of the classes lore/fantasy is based in/on Pandaria, the expansion that a lot of people seem to really hate<br />
<br />
on top of that starting from level 1 on a class added so much later than the others is kind of a turn off for many people with more established characters already</div></div><hr />

I spent a lot of time in LFR in Pandaria, and there were all kinds of players there - some who would rage quit after one wipe, some who'd stick around for a while, or for a specific boss, and then people who were there for the whole ride - and were willing to talk strats and such. And a LOT of runs where we'd get a good group, and start chain running LFRs together. It wasn't the design, it was the players who made it what it is. I think the devs need to step back and let the players define what it's going to be, rather than try to force behavior through design. They do that with pugs, after all. I saw the exact same behavior in normal pugging back then, too - rage quits on a single wipe, etc.<br />
<br />
You'll never cater to everyone with LFR. He thinks they'll be able to - but just like with class &quot;balance&quot;, it's kind of a pipe dream. But trying endless varieties is job security for game designers, so they'll be tinkering with it forever. <br />
<br />
I think LFR was perfect in MoP. Just hard enough to provide an end-game for the casual players, some reward to get the more serious players in there, and it was a legit step in the progression. I know I felt a LOT more comfortable stepping into normal raids once I knew the basic layouts and fights from LFR. <br />
<br />
I love the design reel at the end there - there's some cool design on FX in the game, but fights are so damn cluttered these days you can't see most of it. Or were, I havent actually played since the first week of WOD. I always wanted a filter, that turned off other player's spell FX, or made them fainter. I couldn't even tell you what rogue FX looks like, even though I played one for 10 years - it was lost in the clutter from everyone else.</div></div><hr />

As a designer you only have influence over the design. You can't change people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This ×1000<br />
<br />
Doing LFR gave me the confidence to raid normal. It let you get the concept of the raid, though more simply first .... and once getting the &quot;lay of the land&quot; move on to normal. I'm just lucky right now in that I have a decent group to do normals with first.<br />
<br />
But I think they've gimped EN LFR a bit too much. I've tanked it with a mate and used all the tips I've learned from DPSing normal; we pretty much breezed through, but we learned a bit too. But going in as a DPS, the tanks in LFR just ignored mechanics .... because they can. MOP LFR had just the right level of difficulty so that (in the beginning at least), LFR was a good training ground to go forward. Now its easier than heroic dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Doing LFR gave me the confidence to raid normal. It let you get the concept of the raid, though more simply first .... and once getting the &quot;lay of the land&quot; move on to normal. I'm just lucky right now in that I have a decent group to do normals with first.<br />

<br />
While this may be true in the perceptions of players starting to raid, in actuality it's the opposite. <br />
<br />
In WoTLK, 10 man normal PuGs expected people to come in not knowing the fights. Explaining was relatively commonplace. <br />
<br />
By MoP, with the introduction of LFR, the expectation became that everyone should know the fights and be able to do them even in Flex(Normal) mode. <br />
<br />
IMO, this is the indirect cause of a lot of the lack of tolerance and teaching that happens in normal PuGs, due to the expectation that you can have already done it in LFR. <br />
<br />
Especially given that LFR (even in MoP) didn't teach the fights correctly most times, it's a bad assumption and leads to people trying to step up from LFR to anything else have a bad experience more often than not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some LFRs in the past have been ridiculously easy, to the point that many 25m LFRs have been 10 people playing and 15 people afk or on follow, where you can completely ignore all mechanics. That leads to people thinking, I've done LFR, normal should be the next step (and it really should be), and they are completely lost since it's such a big jump. LFR should be at least difficult enough that you have to roughly follow the mechanics and have the possibility of wiping. <br />
<br />
Loot is the other problem, where with some LFR in the past loot was too good and too close to normal for far less effort. 835 like it is in Legion is fine, as long as it's kept in-line with heroic dungeon gear I have no problem with that. <br />
<br />
LFR does have a role, either for casual players that still want to try the content without getting too serious or having to join a raiding guild. Also, it's great for alts if you want to try raiding with a different role from your main. As long as LFR is tuned right in those aspects it's a great thing.</div></div><hr />

Comparing the number of Brewmasters in HFC to those in EN it seems pretty obvious that it's the redesign that made people ditch their monks. Monk always had a massive proportion of tanks compared to other classes, and now brewmaster is basically non-existent.</div></div><hr />

Unless you play in a top-pro guild, but if you join LFR then honestly: what did you expect the player skill to be?<br />
<br />
However the blame is not fully on people. Blizzard flat refused to implement an AFK protection into LFR, so obviously people understood that it was perfectly fine to go afk during a boss. Those are the kind of actions that you call a design flaw. A game designer that says &quot;Oh we did not expect people to do that&quot; is pointing out a mistake HE made, because it is the job of a game designer to design a game for people, not the job of people to adapt to the game design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lots of people keep saying this, but why? Why do people need to burn through content and level 10 alts in the first three months? Personally I'm finding it refreshing that this is not an expansion that I've had time to level all my alts this soon. It really does remind me of BC, and to an extent, vanilla. in BC I didn't really start with my alt army until well into that expansion. Vanilla I had two max level toons because, well, vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on top of that starting from level 1 on a class added so much later than the others is kind of a turn off for many people with more established characters already<br />
<br />
Sorry, three expansions in, with two of those being very long expansions, it is no longer a newer class. I main a WW Monk, and like MW healing, but I also understand that there should be some time devoted to the Monk. It hasn't aged well, especially lore-wise, since the MoP.</div></div><hr />

Monks are low because to create one you had to start at level 1. Why do that when you could make a DK or DH and start from 58 or 98. <br />
<br />
I'm trying to level a druid from 80 right now and gah its aweful to catch it up even now. I can see new Dks dropping in numbers as the expansions go. I half think DHs wouldn't be the population that it is now if you had to start from lvl 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. LFR in MoP was not different to Cata, MoP or Legion. You could ignore almost all mechanics (except Durumu :) ) and Tunnel on the Boss. MoP-LFR wasn't hard at all, I really don't get why this gets parroted around on the forums all the time.<br />
<br />
Seeing the post on reddit in which you basically say that LFR is the worst design decision you've ever made, I'm wondering what was the idea/mindset behind making it? To allow people who aren't that good at the game to experience raiding?<br />
Yeah I expanded a little in that answer. I said that the goal of getting players with less time or willingness to wipe for 3 hours into raiding was a noble goal. Raiding is fun. It's the most epic part of the game IMHO. A lot of storytelling happens in raids and you get to see some great art and interact with famous characters.<br />
<br />
The altenative was to make the difficulty level so easy that you'd probably steamroll every boss and that's sort of where we ended up, but it meant you weren't really doing a rotation, lots of people were AFK and these famous bosses hit like kittens.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As they like to say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. LFR did sound good on paper, but after 3 Expansions we have seen that it just does not work - autoqueuing and challenge will never work.</div></div><hr />
