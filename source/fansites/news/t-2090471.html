Kalgan is leaving World of Warcraft as Game Director and moving on to another project with Blizzard. Ion Hazzikostas is stepping up as game director!<br />
Greetings fellow WoW players, <br />
<br />
It’s been a little over a month since we launched Legion, and it’s been awesome to see players enjoying so many different aspects of the expansion—leveling up their characters and Artifacts, diving into World Quests, taking on the Emerald Nightmare. Legion PvP Season 1 is going strong, and some of the best Arena teams from around the world are competing for a chance to battle on the big stage at BlizzCon. <br />
<br />
Soon we’ll be releasing our first new content update for the expansion—Patch 7.1: Return to Karazhan—which opens up the Mythic 5-player Karazhan dungeon, continues the story of Suramar, introduces a new raid, and adds even more World Quests and other content. But that’s just the start of it, as we have what we believe to be an extremely exciting patch plan for the rest of the expansion.<br />
<br />
For me, Legion has been more than just another expansion, though—it’s the culmination of more than a decade of work with one of the best development teams I’ve ever had the pleasure to be a part of. And it’s with a mix of excitement, sadness, and gratitude that I’m saying farewell to the WoW team and moving on to a new adventure within Blizzard.<br />
<br />
In 2004, before I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to serve as game director, I started on the World of Warcraft team as a senior game designer. As you can imagine, World of Warcraft was quite a bit different in 2004. Early that year, there were just 60 of us on the team. Around that time in the Friends and Family Alpha, questing was only available up to level 25—for the Alliance only—and the Horde wasn’t playable at all. Some players were even using dial-up modem connections to access the test. <br />
<br />
Many on the team still debated on whether the Horde and Alliance should be separated into factions. (We know how that one turned out.) Several other core features of the game didn’t even exist, including raids and PvP. We’ve come a long way since then, with six expansions under our belts to go along with countless raids, dungeons, Battlegrounds, features, and more.<br />
<br />
My personal journey working on WoW as Game Director is at an end, but my journey with Blizzard isn’t. I’ll still be here, but will be focusing on another project within the company. However, it’s with great pleasure that I announce Ion Hazzikostas will be taking my place as Game Director for World of Warcraft. <br />
<br />
I know that WoW will be in great hands with Ion at the helm. He’s been an integral part of the team for more than eight years and has contributed to so many aspects of the game’s development—from class design to encounter design and nearly everything in between. He also has an amazing team at his side—the same epic crew that brought you all the content you’re enjoying in Legion.<br />
<br />
As a member of the WoW team, I can assure you that the future for World of Warcraft continues to be bright—and as a player, I’m excited to discover what’s in store next alongside all of you. World of Warcraft is the product of the passion of both the team and all of its players, so I’d also like to thank each of you for the wonderful journey that working on the WoW development team has been.<br />
<br />
Thank you, and may you have many more epic adventures!</div></div><hr />

He just switches to another project within Blizzard, so not really in my opinion. Being on the same game for 12 years is a long time, so I can understand why he might want to switch to another project</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, can't wait for Ion to step up. He's done a great job so far and he's the only one who really spoke truthfully about WoD. He also seems to be the one who has the most excitement towards the game. Can't wait.<br />

<br />
If Titan was well into development chances are that they have taken a chunk of it, grabbed the most prominent characters and slapped them all into a &quot;smaller&quot; game to not only generate initial hype but also establish Lore. Just like they did with Warcraft to start off with. <br />
<br />
Curiously enough that thought has retreated to the back of my mind until today... Actually woke up thinking about it again and have spent the whole day thinking about it and now... I read these news. Awesome coincidence. :) <br />

It's the one aspect of Legion that I am notably disappointed in, and the rate (and seeming lack of willingness) of Ion and co to tackle actual design flaws/concerns for multiple specs throughout the alpha, beta, live, and now towards the release of the first major patch is worrying. There's a distinct air of &quot;this is how the spec works now, sorry if you don't like it&quot; that makes me concerned that existing issues will not be touched on for pretty much the entirety of Legion.</div></div><hr />

Quite the contrary. WoW was taking a bad turn, seems like Blizzard realized that and is changing their perspectives.<br />
There's also the possibility that it's a huge coincidence (or no at all) that all the guys who are forever on the same job are on the move, just like what usually happens to people who are forever on the same job. Happens to everything from game companies to music bands, people are always on the move.</div></div><hr />

I am not saying it because I want to see wow to end but seriously get all the clues. Guys are stepping out of it because the have already finished it. At least the story and the direction it is headed. Of course there is still work to be done on those ending expansions but that is mostly for art team and coders.</div></div><hr />

Or they are changing their perspective? Giving someone new and experienced the leadership role. No point in arguing though, you'll stick to your belief that WoW is dead no matter what I or anyone else says.</div></div><hr />

They already said there is plenty more expansions to come. It's the same people that have worked on it for around 10 years. That would get tedious eventually.</div></div><hr />

I love how all the doomsayers are claiming this is a nail in WoW's coffin, when all the decisions about the direction of the game since Wrath were overseen by Kalgan. You won't go broke betting on those very same doomsayers crying about those decisions.<br />

WRONG.<br />
Carbine's founders were 17 former members of Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft development team. Since then they have employed key personnel from games such as Diablo II, StarCraft, Metroid Prime, Fallout, EverQuest, City of Heroes, Half-Life 2 and many from other titles.<br />
They left Blizz early i thing before 2007 but left us expacs including wotlk.<br />
Ion comes to Blizz in 2008</div></div><hr />

The story is finished. Of course it is kept as secret before it will be present in the game itself. We just don't know the ending yet. Only this big figures in Blizzard do.</div></div><hr />

- it's the Legion, Sargeras has been the big looming bad guy for the entire game, and now he's here: virtually any follow-up expansion will pale by comparison, and the only possible exception would be The Dark Below (an Azjatar / N'zoth / Lovecraft expansion), but given that we're now in the Broken Isles - this is likely also going to be the N'zoth conclusion<br />
<br />
- The Illidan arc will come to a close, and this expansion has been building him up immensely as some sort of Chosen One<br />
<br />
- We're killing off gods left and right lately: Ysera dies in a zone intro quest, we kill Ursoc, Cenarius is corrupted/on death's door. Meanwhile the Shadowpriests are feeding all of Azeroth's old gods to a very hungry dagger-old-god. All the Naaru are dying. Azeroth is apparently some kind of titan. Elune (the only actual god in WoW lore) is now taking an active role in the affairs of mortals, something she's pretty much kept out of for 10,000 years since the last Legion invasion. The DKs are literally preparing for the end of all life. The DH's keep yammering on about the virtue of sacrificing everything. <br />
<br />
- The Illidan history quests demonstrate that the key turning point in his life was when he recognized he would need to sacrifice his own soldiers to save the world, and that any amount of sacrifice was permissible if it resulted in him ultimately winning against the Legion - that seems like pretty obvious foreshadowing that in order to defeat Sargeras, Illidan is going to sacrifice our Raid Group (who are now all the most powerful heros in Azeroth) to empower himself to get on Sargeras' level<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in RL: <br />
<br />
- Ghostcrawler left WoW because of creative differences after Pandaland and prior to Draenor, and Draenor was obviously a stop-gap expansion hastily created when Project Titan fell through - he wanted to do something bigger/better, not oversee the shittiest expansion and wait around for years <br />
<br />
- Project Titan was clearly something much, much bigger - and then got completely scrapped and became Overwatch with a team a fraction the size of the original (it was clearly a new MMO originally)<br />
<br />
- Kalgan was originally leading Titan before it got scrapped (when I suspect it was an MMO), and now he's leaving to run another new project (return of the next Blizzard MMO)<br />
<br />
- Ion's taking over WoW, because he's one of the only devs whose heart is still in WoW (I like Ion, I think this is a good move overall)<br />
<br />
So to sum it all up: <br />
- Legion final expansion<br />
- New Blizzard MMO coming<br />
- Ion might actually give a shit to fix stuff before 8.0 (because there may not be an 8.1)</div></div><hr />

You have a very skewed perception of what is happening in the WoW universe. The things we've seen in Legion thus far has not closed any story hooks, rather, it has opened up a dozen new ones. As for the IRL side of it, we had two guys who had worked 10-22 years on the warcraft franchise. One guy who switched positions within the company. As someone who works in a company with a similar structure as Blizzard, this shit happens often. In fact I am surprised it didn't happen MORE often for Blizzard. Doomsayers here like to play the experts without having any actual clue how a business works and that is quite frankly laughable. If you took five minutes to research something before you opened your mouth people might take you mroe seriously. But then again, I am wasting my breath on the MMO champion forums, this is the cesspool in which you thrive and thrive in your own filth you should.

There's also the possibility that it's a huge coincidence (or no at all) that all the guys who are forever on the same job are on the move, just like what usually happens to people who are forever on the same job. Happens to everything from game companies to music bands, people are always on the move.<br />
<br />
I agree with Bumbac on this.<br />
Most of the top guys that were there from the beginning have left recently and fairly close to one another in a staggered fashion. For Metzen to leave and not move to another project within Blizzard signals that the ENTIRE closing story of WoW is now complete, he has nothing to prove and has made plenty of $$$. Not only that but his sabbatical will allow him to enjoy his family and then move to a whole new direction and write his own check without causing any hard feelings with the community and others at Blizzard. I have a feeling he probably did not want to wrap up the story and is not 100% happy with the teams decision.<br />
<br />
I think a bold move is on the horizon and Blizz is hoping to transition a major part of the player base into something with more room for growth and leave something behind for those who do not want to move on and for those who have invested so much of their time and effort. I have a very good idea what that would entail but I am not going to expound on it here...I have been met with quite a bit of resistance in other threads for being 100% on board with something similar.<br />
<br />
Ultimately they will follow the $$$ and the player base will vote with their wallet. Sub numbers over the next 4-6 years will determine what will happen in the end.<br />
Even then, it won't be the end. I think many of us long for something new and the WoW engine can only go so far. I am looking forward to see what they have in store...I need a new journey.<br />
<br />
Note: In my first paragraph I was talking about the rest of the story that will extend 2 more expansions. The only thing they will have left to do is follow the story line and concepts laid out and code it.<br />
Oh and I meant to quote Bumbac's statement but only got Azahel's response to him...my bad.</div></div><hr />

I work in a corporate environment. Who said this was uncommon? <br />
<br />
A better project is coming up, and Kalgan being who he is wants to go lead it - so he did. Kalgan's spent his entire life on MMO's (EverQuest, WoW), I take that as solid evidence that what's coming next is a new Blizzard MMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did I miss a joke? The best I can come up with is that you actually think Reddit is so vastly and obviously superior to other forums, that to even suggest otherwise is... funny? Again, bizarre forum elitism. <br />
<br />
<br />
No, what's truly bizarre is your outright ignorance towards a topic that is fairly easy to understand.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I'm failing to understand, but I don't even understand what topic you're accusing me of failing to understand. Did I fail to understand that Kalgan is leaving? No. Or are we still discussing the perceived superiority of Reddit? If Reddit was truly that superior, why are you here? Do you feel unworthy to post in the glowing gold-gilt halls of /r/? :p<br />
<br />
<br />
You just wish to jump the bandwagon because you are too lazy/too unintelligent to achieve anything else. <br />
<br />
Jump the bandwagon...? The bandwagon that formed in the last 4 pages since Kalgan quit? What bandwagon, and where is it going? Further, you jump on a bandwagon, to jump the bandwagon would be to like... identify a popular trend of opinion, and then leap clear over it to an even more extreme interpretation - like if someone said the Earth was round, and then most people agreed - and then you vaulted over that bandwagon and suggested that the Earth is a perfect mathematical sphere - but the bandwagon drives right past you as they all shake their head - you went too far. Whether it's just a missed word, or you don't know the analogy you are using - it's still an interesting thought - may need to use that in the future. <br />
<br />
In any case, what am I failing to achieve by boarding the ...Kalgan leaving theory bandwagon? In what way is that lazy/unintelligent? <br />
<br />
<br />
Stop trying to be witty. :p<br />

<br />
<br />
those bestest ever raids helped retain a whole 20% of the subscriber base in WoD so Ion should definitely run the whole game. Who needs people that went to college for programming and computer science when you can have a lawyer deciding on the direction of it.<br />
<br />
Why do you think designing encounters requires the capability to actually do the coding? All he needs to DESIGN it is a rudimentary understanding of limitations and an imagination. The actual labor force does the coding.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they were critiquing anything. It was a response to a post where someone was excited under the supposed false assumption that Watcher helped to design WotLK raids. I don't actually know either way btw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They will need to do it at some point, as much as I like Legion so far - WoW is showing it's age- and if it isn't reinvented someone will eventually come out with a new MMO that is just too far advanced in both tech and gameplay that it will make WoW look outdated. <br />
<br />
Think of it like succession planning - at some point WoW needs to retire - they can hire internally to replace it (make WoW 2 or etc), or it will be replaced by something external (someone else's MMO). If they cannibalize their own market they maintain or grow their customer base (new mmo's lure in/back a lot more people than new WoW expansions) - but if they ignore it for too many expansions they will eventually bleed subscribers, and then something marginally better will come along. Even the best video games have a lifespan.</div></div><hr />

Umm, I not taking a side with this discussion....but direct responses, you know the active voice comes out as a much better way to combat someone. Writing every &quot;response&quot; in the form of a question, doesn't speak to your superior place in the discussion, it makes you sound like a self-righteous jerk.

Anyway, life goes on, neither Ion nor Jeff are masters of the universe - Ion really likes what he is doing, from Elitist Jerks to leading the wow project. IF that's what he wants, then congrats to him I ofc, wish him all the best. I'm not disappointed at all by Legion (not just his efforts). nor how he has risen to the task in the public eye at least. <br />
<br />
Saying that, there are so many amazing guys here at blizzard, the half of which you don't know.

You do realize that Ion wasn't a designer or a developer before he came to WoW? He has been a lawyer when Blizzard hired him, which is pretty much closer to a PR-guy that should know how and what to say than a developer or designer. <br />

If Titan was well into development chances are that they have taken a chunk of it, grabbed the most prominent characters and slapped them all into a &quot;smaller&quot; game to not only generate initial hype but also establish Lore. Just like they did with Warcraft to start off with. <br />

Will be interesting to see what comes of this. I think a lot of problems with the game are from a lack of leadership and vision, but I don't see Ion as a leader-type.

You'd see a hiring pattern for a project that big. Which could still happen, but until it happens, it's more likely he's going over to the unannounced Diablo project, or they're repurposing the Starcraft team into something else. I highly doubt that they'd want to run two MMOs at the same time. <br />

Granted, his new project could be in the initial planning stages, and years from release, so there's a small possibility it could be a new MMO, and WoW is going to slowly go into maintenance mode over the next couple of years. <br />
<br />
Watch, tho - the legacy server crowd is going to insist he's leaving to work on legacy servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Kalgan, or Chilton, had nothing to do with Titan. He has worked on WoW since it was in alpha. Jeff Kaplan (Tigole) was working on Titan, he moved over to Overwatch with Metzen when they killed the project. <br />
<br />
I don't know why you put spoiler tags on all of that - it's complete nonsense with no factual backing whatsoever.<br />

he was hired as a lawyer for Blizzard towards the end of WotLK so he didnt have influence on raid design until much later.<br />

With all of Tom exp from wow it would make sense to have him on the planning stage of a new mmo so they could learn from wows passed mistakes.<br />
<br />
The thing that throws a spanner in that idea is if bliz knew they wanted to make a new mmo why would they let so many devs from wow leave the company in the passed couple of month ? ALot of them stating they wanted to do something new after working on wow for so long. I think they wouldnt of left if given the chance to work on a new project and if it was an mmo there exp would of been very valuable.</div></div><hr />

The best I can come up with is that you actually think Reddit is so vastly and obviously superior to other forums, that to even suggest otherwise is... funny? Again, bizarre forum elitism. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps I'm failing to understand, but I don't even understand what topic you're accusing me of failing to understand. Did I fail to understand that Kalgan is leaving? No. Or are we still discussing the perceived superiority of Reddit? If Reddit was truly that superior, why are you here? Do you feel unworthy to post in the glowing gold-gilt halls of /r/? :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Jump the bandwagon...? The bandwagon that formed in the last 4 pages since Kalgan quit? What bandwagon, and where is it going? Further, you jump on a bandwagon, to jump the bandwagon would be to like... identify a popular trend of opinion, and then leap clear over it to an even more extreme interpretation - like if someone said the Earth was round, and then most people agreed - and then you vaulted over that bandwagon and suggested that the Earth is a perfect mathematical sphere - but the bandwagon drives right past you as they all shake their head - you went too far. Whether it's just a missed word, or you don't know the analogy you are using - it's still an interesting thought - may need to use that in the future. <br />
<br />
In any case, what am I failing to achieve by boarding the ...Kalgan leaving theory bandwagon? In what way is that lazy/unintelligent? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Witty people don't try to be witty, it's our natural state - though I don't even know what it is you think was particularly witty? Iz mah vocabz too bige?<br />
<br />
What's actually pretty hilarious is that out of anything you took from the post you chose to become worked up over Reddit. Furthermore, you can't go on a full rant about extreme interpretations when you're literally doing the same thing yourself. You talk about a business model like you are an expert on the topic but you do not show off having any actual experience with it. All you do is make noise. The bottom line was: your knowledge of WoW lore is lacking, your knowledge of running a business is lacking. Your particular breed of forum-rats is an annoyance at best. And no amount of becoming triggered severely out of context will change that.</div></div><hr />

I think people tend to forget that Ion was a player first and not only that he lead a raid guild. And even further, he admitted he STILL raids even though he's no longer a raid leader. So it's easy to overlook that as someone who plays his own game sabotaging it is probably one of the last things he wants to do.<br />

I think a successful transition has to be mandatory (for players), but also incorporated into the existing game - both paying homage, enabling people to maintain their names, communities, etc - but also doing a full reset. A lot can be learned from the attempted (failed) transition between EverQuest and EverQuest 2, because they spun it off as a completely separate game they split or lost their community - a mandatory transition is necessary to keep community cohesion together, and focus resources (rather than split into maintaining a legacy WoW and building a whole new game, otherwise both end up half-assed). <br />
<br />
If I were them, it would roll-out as a grand new expansion - at least as far as current players are concerned. Existing WoW server names would be preserved, your character names would be saved on your servers across both games, your characters would remain in their existing guilds (also preserved across both games), your achievements from WoW would still be visible in the Armory/inspection window. <br />
<br />
Where it would differ, is you do something like - an 'expansion' - on an entirely new engine, with new gameplay mechanics stealing the best of everything MMO's have come up with over the last 15 years since WoW began - and all the tech WoW couldn't really do because their engine is old. <br />
<br />
You put the game in a different time, say, 10k years prior when the Legion previously invaded (War of the Ancients timeline (http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/War_of_the_Ancients)) - that avoids any retconning issues, all the stuff in WoW 1 is now occurring in the far future. Maybe we lose this expansion, Sargeras takes Azeroth - Chromie teleports the entire planet to the past to try again... #StillABetterPlotThanDraenor<br />
<br />
So from the perspective of existing players, you log into the next expansion - but you do so on an entirely different client - you start at Level 1, but you still have your current name, server, and guild intact - except now you're Level 1 again - and we're 10k years in the past. It feels like a big expansion. <br />
<br />
From the perspective of new players coming to try out WoW 2, they're logging into an entirely new MMO just as they do with Rift, SWTOR, Tera, WildStar, etc. It feels like a new game. <br />
<br />
In exchange for all this, you have the opportunity to reinvent the game while preserving their existing community - you get to update the game in a way an expansion never would - and that keeps them competitive for potentially another 10-15 years of MMO dominance. New players aren't intimidated by the 15 year headstart everyone else has currently - to whom they feel they will never catch up (a big problem with MMO's as they get older, is that you bleed current players due to attrition, but you can't take in new players because you aren't shiny and new, and you're way too intimidating to leap into fresh). <br />
<br />
Consider the alternative - if they try to keep the game floating for another 3-10 expansions, someone will eventually come out with something that simply blows WoW out of the water - visually and technically. It won't die overnight, old MMO's never do (there are still people playing Ultima and EverQuest 1) - but it will die. The way MMO playerbases work is you get a big spike off your launch - and then you basically bleed that community out from attrition with each patch/expansion - sometimes you can win some of your former players back - but you rarely get truly new players. WoW does a fantastic job of bleeding slowly - no other game has bled as slowly as WoW - but without a massive injection of truly new players - all MMO's fade out eventually.</div></div><hr />

I disagree, but for the exact same reasons. <br />
Tom would from time to time say something that turned out not to happen, or oversell/downplay certain things. However, Ion is like someone with a severe mental disability; Sure, it is possible for him to function, but everything he touches still gets covered in poop.</div></div><hr />

I'm inclined to agree that he knows someone, which is usually the case these days with all companies. Its who you know not what you know in just about every line of work. I think the WoW community collectively agree that he shouldn't be in the position hes in(not sure people even want him involved with wow at this point). I would be interested seeing a poll of who the community has wanted gone over the past few years.... and by how much Holinka would win that poll over everyone else. lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
SPOILERS BELOW<br />
<br />
<br />
- players are more powerful than ever, we're all the leaders of our respective classes now, wielding the most powerful artifact weapons in the history of Azeroth<br />
<br />
- it's the Legion, Sargeras has been the big looming bad guy for the entire game, and now he's here: virtually any follow-up expansion will pale by comparison, and the only possible exception would be The Dark Below (an Azjatar / N'zoth / Lovecraft expansion), but given that we're now in the Broken Isles - this is likely also going to be the N'zoth conclusion<br />
<br />
- The Illidan arc will come to a close, and this expansion has been building him up immensely as some sort of Chosen One<br />
<br />
- We're killing off gods left and right lately: Ysera dies in a zone intro quest, we kill Ursoc, Cenarius is corrupted/on death's door. Meanwhile the Shadowpriests are feeding all of Azeroth's old gods to a very hungry dagger-old-god. All the Naaru are dying. Azeroth is apparently some kind of titan. Elune (the only actual god in WoW lore) is now taking an active role in the affairs of mortals, something she's pretty much kept out of for 10,000 years since the last Legion invasion. The DKs are literally preparing for the end of all life. The DH's keep yammering on about the virtue of sacrificing everything. <br />
<br />
- The Illidan history quests demonstrate that the key turning point in his life was when he recognized he would need to sacrifice his own soldiers to save the world, and that any amount of sacrifice was permissible if it resulted in him ultimately winning against the Legion - that seems like pretty obvious foreshadowing that in order to defeat Sargeras, Illidan is going to sacrifice our Raid Group (who are now all the most powerful heros in Azeroth) to empower himself to get on Sargeras' level<br />
<br />
Meanwhile in RL: <br />
<br />
- Ghostcrawler left WoW because of creative differences after Pandaland and prior to Draenor, and Draenor was obviously a stop-gap expansion hastily created when Project Titan fell through - he wanted to do something bigger/better, not oversee the shittiest expansion and wait around for years <br />
<br />
- Project Titan was clearly something much, much bigger - and then got completely scrapped and became Overwatch with a team a fraction the size of the original (it was clearly a new MMO originally)<br />
<br />
- Kalgan was originally leading Titan before it got scrapped (when I suspect it was an MMO), and now he's leaving to run another new project (return of the next Blizzard MMO)<br />
<br />
- Ion's taking over WoW, because he's one of the only devs whose heart is still in WoW (I like Ion, I think this is a good move overall)<br />
<br />
So to sum it all up: <br />
- Legion final expansion<br />
- New Blizzard MMO coming<br />
- Ion might actually give a shit to fix stuff before 8.0 (because there may not be an 8.1)<br />
<br />
This is a joke right?</div></div><hr />

Huh? The biggest sub rating was in Wotlk, the first expansion to make raiding accessible to all by throwing out vanilla/tbc design restrictions by balancing multiple difficulty and group tiers towards access right upto the LK by the regular player/casual raider. Its first raid was Naxx, as a benchmark example of this accessibility (since only 1% of players ever got to see the raid in vanilla).</div></div><hr />

Yeah, my biggest concern as well. Given his background and the usual &quot;raiding is awsome, uber, epic, greatness incarnate, etc&quot; garbage he usually uses in his posts, the chances for that happening again are certainly not zero. The massive HR exchange around WoW is very concerning as well and that during a time, when frankly, the game is pretty decent for the first time in half a decade. I would've understood that during WoD, but now? We will see, I guess...</div></div><hr />

When he talked about Legion in interviews, it didn't sound like this was his vision; on the other side, Ion was the one that talked about Legion systems like artifacts, order halls, loot changes with deep insight and passion.<br />
<br />
My theory is that big figures like Chilton or Metzen weren't involved at all in Legion, but wanted to retire/officially change project when WoW is in good state, leaving during WoD would be like running from sinking ship.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pssst... i tell you a secret. Before LFR and the possibility for everybody to see that kind of content raids never had any impact on sub numbers. And just because world content is &quot;below your level&quot; doesn't mean nobody likes it. Back then ther has been a ton of people that didn't play WoW before. Only very few stayed with WoW the whole time (Blizzard confirmed) most people started WoW, levelt, did dungeons and PvP an some raided.... then left the game. This happened even in Classic. Point being: there have been enough people to start WoW at each point. At some point they have reached a level where 100,000,000 accounts have been created, which pretty much means that most people who had interest in MMORPGs had already tested WoW and probably played it for some time, then left. <br />
<br />
But you are not actually telling me that raids, which blizzard stated only very very very few people got to see, have been the major drawing argument for the majority to play this game, do you? WOW from Classic to Wrath has been the most successful game BECAUSE it was the most accessible MMO out there that made it easy to get involved into, like no other game out there.</div></div><hr />

How could you possibly even say that Legion is one of the worst expansions you've played? We're like a month and a half in! LOL! Even if you've only played since WoD you would still just be plain wrong (yes I'm saying your opinion is wrong, because it is).... By January there will already be just as many raids released as there were in the entirety of WoD! Don't get me wrong, Legion is not without its faults (like how unfriendly it has been to alts), but it is shaping up to be one of the better expansions they've ever released! WoD and Cata are almost universally accepted as being the worst expansions they've released, with WoD even coming in WAY behind Cata. Wrath and MoP seem to be the crowd favorites, with Wrath probably pulling ahead (I personally liked MoP more). BC I think would be the next in line, which is right about where I would put Legion currently. Just looking at all of the content poised to release in the next few months I can honestly see Legion jumping into the upper tiers of the history of WoW quite easily. I, for one, can't wait to see what comes next!</div></div><hr />

My #1 reason: I'm a grinder, not a quester. <br />
<br />
I play a lot of alts, usually not hitting max level until 2-4 months into an expansion. Yeah, it usually takes me that long to figure out what i want to do. this expansion, I was going with 1 toon. I went to 110, kicked some nuts 7-8 times, tried to level some alts - it's easy to start with the artifact quest, I don't mind that too much, but then having to help Nate not kill Genn another dozen times or watch all sorts of cool druids get corn holed left and right... and BEING FORCED to do it, if you want that alt to have any progression... naw bruh.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it is worse than WoD or Cata, but it is a very average expansion and may suffer the same fate of WoD if it is not supported beyond patch 7.2</div></div><hr />

<br />
You probably didn't raid back then, because if you did you would know there was overall dissatisfaction towards the new easy mode. The dungeons were a start, with grouping up and just facerolling everything. But that didn't really bother people because there were still raids. Naxx was relatively easy but still a nice raid to start with, also with the achievements of not dieing you could atleast get some fun out of it and display your skill. Then came Ulduar, with the insane hard modes and probably by far the best raid to be released at that time. It was for everyone but still didn't need to have multiple difficulties to accomplish that. Then came ToC and a lot of the players knew this wasn't going to be the game they wanted it to become. Probably most people waited it out until Lich King, then left when Cataclysm arrived. <br />
<br />
Long story short, more numbers doesn't automatically mean it was in the best state at the time. Look at WoD's spike, you an also point to that and say it was the second best thing to ever happen to WoW, if you look only to the numbers that is. We all know better, as people should about Wotlk. Theme, by far the best. Design decisions, one of the worst.</div></div><hr />

I bet you almost even have yourself convinced. :p You can sit out with all of those people who say they're fed up and unsub'ing (month after month after month).<br />
<br />
I didn't say I was fed up. I think you misunderstand me. I am REALLY enjoying Legion... I haven't wanted to look for active organized raiding since WotLK and I'm doing it again.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of cool games out there... other MMOs that I think would be really fun. But I play them all for a few levels, and I'm done. My feelings as I close up shop on those games is... &quot;I'm really not interested in investing the time I have invested into WoW.&quot; Blizzard has a quality product with WoW... yes there are problems, and we can argue that point to its final stupidity but on the whole, Blizzard games and always have been TOP NOTCH.<br />
<br />
To this day I don't consider myself an MMO player. I play WoW... thats pretty much it.<br />
<br />
The trailer on the WCIII disc got me interested.<br />
<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZtzy80n8WI<br />
I remember checking Blizzard's homepage what felt like weekly, until the beta came out. I played that I invited a new friend I made to play, (who was big into EQ) he told me if you like MMOs you should try City of Heroes. Which I did (spent waaaay too much time in character creation) but even a fully developed and released game didn't hold a candle to the beta experience I had with WoW. So I stopped playing that. (At this time MMOs still had that EQ, basement dwelling, neckbeard, bathe once a month stigma).<br />
<br />
I played SWTOR to level cap upon launch, and I haven't really played since (did some PvP no real endgame experience). There is truth to what Yvaelle is saying about new, or even returning players being overwhelmed and intimidated once an MMO gets older. Now I think SWTOR has a superior 1 player experience/story. But I think Legion has really stepped up its game in that regard, I still think SWTOR is probably doing that better, but there are definite design choices there and I see the rationale behind not copying/ripping off or making a direct clone (and that goes both ways).<br />
<br />
So like I said I don't really play MMOs I play WoW. I really love Blizzard products, so the likelihood that I would pick up WoW 2 is strong. My feelings about that commitment again are really that maybe I shouldn't. I feel like that would a lot easier to do if I didn't have a connection to a character/account that I enjoy playing.</div></div><hr />

If it was left up to you and yours to vote for a Game Designer, you'd vote in a Kung Fu Panda who's into k3teenz and rides Pon33z (after My Little Pony) anyway.<br />
<br />
Not sure what this has to do with someone who is leading a department and is responsible for the decisions his team has made. Also having been in lead positions myself, I can 100% assure you that you get more freedom to do what you want and your team has to do what you say... more than you might think. As a lead you are responsible for your team and how holinka has lead his team and found the designs hes responsible for, and he thinks its &quot;the best pvp experience&quot; is laughable. <br />
<br />
This is the same guy who said it was acceptable that tanks be in top rated PvP(four 15+ minute games with a Prot pally at ~50% dampening in the NA regionals tourny)<br />
This was the same guy that said mages have a heal, and considered blink a heal because it avoids damage so they have to consider mages and their healing potential.<br />
This is the same guy who rarely shows up to PvP events, and when he does he is a complete ass to the players and doesn't even talk to them.<br />
This is the same guy who said Ashran was the most amazing PvP experience that has ever been created in WoW<br />
<br />
This list can go on and on.. but i think you get what I'm saying.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you who I would put as game director, i don't work at blizz. I can sure as hell tell you it wouldn't be Holinka(again hired in 2012 coming from working on random small FPS games) who has zero experience leading any MMO design outside of WoW(which was his first MMO and had zero MMORPG, MMORPG PvP, and even MOBA design experience to begin with). <br />

TL: DR - Lead designers get more say than people think. Holinka isn't qualified to be in the position he's in based on his background experience, much less to be a game director.</div></div><hr />

Also having been in lead positions myself, I can 100% assure you that you get more freedom to do what you want and your team has to do what you say... more than you might think. As a lead you are responsible for your team and how holinka has lead his team and found the designs hes responsible for, and he thinks its &quot;the best pvp experience&quot; is laughable. <br />
<br />
This is the same guy who said it was acceptable that tanks be in top rated PvP(four 15+ minute games with a Prot pally at ~50% dampening in the NA regionals tourny)<br />
This was the same guy that said mages have a heal, and considered blink a heal because it avoids damage so they have to consider mages and their healing potential.<br />
This is the same guy who rarely shows up to PvP events, and when he does he is a complete ass to the players and doesn't even talk to them.<br />
This is the same guy who said Ashran was the most amazing PvP experience that has ever been created in WoW<br />
<br />
This list can go on and on.. but i think you get what I'm saying.<br />
<br />
I can't tell you who I would put as game director, i don't work at blizz. I can sure as hell tell you it wouldn't be Holinka(again hired in 2012 coming from working on random small FPS games) who has zero experience leading any MMO design outside of WoW(which was his first MMO and had zero MMORPG, MMORPG PvP, and even MOBA design experience to begin with). <br />

Agreed 100%! I saw this announcement and was like WHAT??? Ion's an arrogant assclown that screws up everything he touches! And yet he gets a promotion??<br />
<br />
I don't know if Blizzard doubling down on this idiot is the right direction... unless they are looking to kill WoW off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenjen</div><div class="date">2016-10-14, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You probably didn't raid back then, because if you did you would know there was overall dissatisfaction towards the new easy mode. The dungeons were a start, with grouping up and just facerolling everything. But that didn't really bother people because there were still raids. Naxx was relatively easy but still a nice raid to start with, also with the achievements of not dieing you could atleast get some fun out of it and display your skill. Then came Ulduar, with the insane hard modes and probably by far the best raid to be released at that time. It was for everyone but still didn't need to have multiple difficulties to accomplish that. Then came ToC and a lot of the players knew this wasn't going to be the game they wanted it to become. Probably most people waited it out until Lich King, then left when Cataclysm arrived. <br />
<br />
Long story short, more numbers doesn't automatically mean it was in the best state at the time. Look at WoD's spike, you an also point to that and say it was the second best thing to ever happen to WoW, if you look only to the numbers that is. We all know better, as people should about Wotlk. Theme, by far the best. Design decisions, one of the worst.<br />
<br />
Didn't raid back then? Don't assume and swallow your own bullshit. I went from killing kelthuzad right down to killing the Lich King when it was current content. There was no &quot;overall dissatisfaction&quot;. It was the same then as it was now. A vocal minority of whiners, some of whom didn't even accomplish any actual raiding, complaining about what they didn't understand and the rest? the &quot;real raiders&quot;? The direction they would have wanted would have killed the game and was killing the game. The new direction is exactly what sustained it. <br />
<br />
The big miss steps were releasing the tourny and ICC too early in the cycle, cutting Ulduar brutally and regretfully short, which lead to a long ass wait afterwards while the world reset in cata consumed resources.<br />
<br />
The initial argument i was countering was stating &quot;numbers back then&quot; incorrectly, so dont twist it around. <br />
<br />
The fact remains, if Blizz had not made the decisions it had concerning non-exclusive raid design, WoW would not have survived as long as it did. There may have been missteps but this is not one of them. Hell the reason it survived all those missteps is because of it.</div></div><hr />

He has been a lawyer when Blizzard hired him, which is pretty much closer to a PR-guy that should know how and what to say than a developer or designer. <br />
<br />
Just... food for thought.<br />
<br />
You most certainly cannot replace it with a guy who was originally a &quot;blood sucking lawyer&quot; before coming to Blizzard. (Ion Hazzikostas - NOT a fan of his)</div></div><hr />

This is hardly &quot;the sky is falling&quot;, he's been working on the game for 12 years - We need new blood so the game can evolve instead of continuing the same shit.<br />
<br />
Maybe new blood, but that's not enough.<br />
<br />
We need designers that are humble enough to go back to the roots and understand why things were designed the way they were, and how not understanding this led to worse and worse decisions over the years: if a game is well done you can't simply decide to wipe this and that talent and switch this from a class to another or from a spec to another, because balancing is very hard, interesting gameplays and depth of play are very precious.<br />
<br />
Designers that understand a new expansion is more than a single gimmick: let's replace talent trees with a few rows of 3 fake choices, let's give every capability to every class,let's remove 90 % of stats, and let's invent a few new retarded ones, because we're more than an RPG, let's steal most capabilities from most classes (pruning), let's force people to play a single spec and let's arbitrarily attribute capabilities to one spec only (class fantasy). <br />
<br />
Designers who understand you can't be everything to every gamer, and understand there is no future in a 3 - button MMORPG, that the 24/7 grinding is already covered by Korean MMORPGs.<br />
<br />
Converserly designers who play other games and are willing to take greats features from a game if its adaptable and relevant to WoW.<br />
<br />
Designers who are ready to listen to players when possible (we want housing) and not systematically overdoing it to the extreme (garrisons).<br />
<br />
And of course, to recognize the very few good ideas, such as reforging, that were added to the game over the years, and cherish and protect them.</div></div><hr />

Ion Fuck Fluying Hazzikostas will make WoW Great again. The Raids were the only good thing in WoD (and have been really good in Cata and MoP), I am really hyped to see what greatness he will bestow upon all of WoW. <br />
<br />
Maybe now we get finally some challenging Solo Content again?<br />
<br />
Well, based on his record as Lead Game Designer thus far... the &quot;greatness he will bestow upon all of WoW&quot; you refer to will likely be in the form of a big, steaming, pile of shit. I am actually shocked he still has a job let alone got a promotion.</div></div><hr />

Ion has given us the best raid encounters - actually challenging and not just overtuned. How in the name of Odin could you call his work &quot;a pile of shit&quot;?</div></div><hr />

And somehow i feel they are in damage-control-mode. Look at this thread:<br />

<br />
The strange thing is, yesterday in the evening the OP was at over 350 upvotes and barely any downvotes. Now at noon i looked to find the OP to receive over 500 downvotes more and ends up being so negatively voted that his post is being hidden. At the same time the downvoted posts questioning the OP got highly upvoted. I know that things like this happen all the time and people shift the voting game on threads. But usually it happens only in a matter of days sometimes even weeks. This time it happened practically over night. No... actually literally over night. <br />
<br />
But no matter what happens there and in other threads, Ion hazzikostas is surely a person that polarizes. There are people that like him for all he did for raids and raiding, and there are people that don't like him because everything besides raiding was/is screwed up (opinions). I personally don't like his &quot;hardecore approach&quot;, not everybody (in fact only a few players) are like his &quot;elitist jerks&quot;. And raiding is only important for a small minority of the games population when it comes to HC+ raiding.</div></div><hr />
