Yes, individual classes/multi-races previews are coming, probably on very nice dedicated pages.<br />

Dragon Soul LFR Testing Now Open (10/26)<br />
The first half of Dragon Soul is now testable through LFR. If you're level 85 and have an average item level above 365, you will be able to queue for the Siege of Wyrmrest Temple. The second LFR entry for the later half of the raid is not yet available.<br />
<br />
This is VERY much a work in progress, the UI is in an unpolished state right now. Give it a try though! <br />
<br />
<br />

Pandas? Why??<br />
Blizzard has given the Panderan a rich culture and a specific way of thinking. A history that goes back beyond the sundering with their own struggles and accomplishments. They have an identity beyond &quot;Look, its Pandas.&quot;<br />
This is something I want to touch on a bit more. People seem to think that Pandaren were a joke, a throw away easter egg that we never fully intended as a playable race.<br />
<br />
I will direct you to recall the Warcraft RPG (pen and paper) manuals released in 2003. While much of it hasn't been canon for quite some time, the Pandaren occupy a greater amount of pages and space within the manuals to establish their lore and story than pretty much every other creature on Azeroth. To give it some context, they occupy the same number of pages as Trolls in the Monster Manual, and share the same amount space in the Alliance and Horde Compendium with Orcs or Humans, and just like them ... you guessed it... Pandaren were a playable race.<br />
<br />
(there's also an awesome sketch Metzen did of a Pandaren, Dwarf, Furbolg, and Gnome hanging out all friendly-like)<br />
<br />
As I said a lot of this was pre-World of Warcraft, and by whatever stroke of fate, Trolls and Forsaken became playable races and Pandaren, Naga, and Furbolgs did not. Some other mix could have just as easily been true, and no one would have questioned it. Worgen didn't even exist back then, of course, they were a new creation for World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
It would simply be inaccurate to state that Pandaren were a throw away. Our intent, going back to Warcraft III, when the vast majority of the world lore and story was established for the franchise, was always to have a deep and rich history for a race known as the Pandaren.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowpedia.org/File:Heroraces.jpg?c=1 There's the pic.<br />
Haha, yup, that's the one. Thank you. And this is actually a great resource covering the contents of the manuals, just please keep in mind that much of it is now highly inaccurate and the visual style of the Pandaren have changed quite a bit since then.<br />

I like Warrior, shaman and Druid best. The rest is ok, mostly, but could have been better. DK and rogue I dislike most...they seem plain and boring to me. Just some more tentacles/movement and slightly more Yogg-like colours and the warlock set could have been really nice. Goggles on the eyes instead of on the head and the mage set would have looked better, too. Paladin...the helm's too big, but maybe that changes with races. Hunter is actually quite nice. Priest looks ok, though I dont quite get a priest feeling from it. Looks more like Darkmoon circus.</div></div><hr />

I'm still disappointed about the DK set, beucase it usually one of the best each tier, while this one is at the bottom this round. I'm also puzzled about the blue neon lights in one of the warrior tiers, but the set itself looks very good. I'm glad that they set the tiers in context with the settings that they obtain them from, and not just randomly decorated armor (although, I do question the excessive use of all those pink/green/yellow jewels that are embedded into the chest, knees, forehead etc, making the set look like a cheap action figure)<br />
I think Warlock wins this round, that head item is badass :)</div></div><hr />

Tried it out last night and me and a guild mate were topping the meters along with a hunter from EU, and the other 14 dps were only doing 14-16k dps. On top of that only about 4-5 people moved for the orbs and tanks constantly tried to make up for the dumb dps that wouldn't stack on orbs and moved the boss. when the boss got moved the rest of his abilities such as orbs and the spikes moved to close to trash and the bad dps pulled trash... this is going to be fun on Live. oh yeah dont forget the assholes that are going to run in and prematurely pull bosses!</div></div><hr />

I.E., I have it all set up the way I want, will there be a button on the character or game interface to swap it to its actual look for a min, or would I have to go back to the transmog NPC?</div></div><hr />

Even if its a Blue post that states a lot of people were asking for it, there really is NO way to prove that, by the numbers, we the players actually did. That statement they made could just be a face saving response to excuse it as what we want when many may not.<br />
<br />
From what I've read in a lot of people's responses to many different topics, Blizz doesn't seem to have a strong tradition of listening to what people want but say what they are implementing is what the players want.<br />
<br />
Long story short, Pandas are here to stay, monk class added for a change of play style, and a newly discovered turtle sland will be the leveling place.

Well of course they could have just made that up, that goes without saying. It's clear people seem polarized over them, but personally I can see a lot of people wanting to play panda bears... it's doesn't seem all that unlikely. Now, was it the &quot;most&quot; requested?

Talk about a rush job it is clear no real thought went into it. The best set goes to male Priest. I'm leveling a Priest just for this set. The new DK t13 set looks like a Power Ranger Villain reject. 1) Priest 2) Paladin 3) Hunter 4) Lock 5) Druid 6) Rogue 7) Sham 8) Mage 9) DK 10) Warrior</div></div><hr />

It's clear people seem polarized over them, but personally I can see a lot of people wanting to play panda bears... it's doesn't seem all that unlikely. Now, was it the &quot;most&quot; requested? We'll never know, of course.<br />
<br />
So true. When they first officially announced it, I laughed and thought &quot;Seriously?&quot; because in all honesty, all I could compare it to was Kung Fu Panda. When I told my 9 yr old son the same thing, his reaction was the same as mine. So even to one particular 9 yr old, it seemed kinda silly.<br />
<br />
But.... it might actually, one day, be fun. Maybe a racial buff will REQUIRE you to drink until the toon is drunk and then fight afterwards. Who knows. :)</div></div><hr />

Some of the other gear sets aren't too bad but I do feel bad for DKs, Warriors, Mages, and rogues. Paladin/shaman/hunter helms are kinda silly too, altho you CAN hide them so the gear will still look good. The Priest helms are interesting - but I'm not 100% I LIKE them. I don't understand the reasoning behind what they did on the female model for them of cutting the mouth/chin section out. Makes it feel incomplete and honestly doesn't look as badass.</div></div><hr />

Because its the race with the most normalized looks, no over-sized shoulders, has feet, no clunky, too big or too small body.<br />
<br />
Having an undead (hands and feet), tauren (stupid looking head, horns and hooves), worgen (stupid looking head as taurens), or troll (extremely skinny body + weird feet) would have a lesser display on the tier parts.<br />

To me it is just that the mage set looks way out of place, like it was meant for the water raid.</div></div><hr />

The helm would be so badass if it had a better texture/colorscheme.I really dislike the pally, dk, and rogue sets. Rogue mainly because of the stitched together look because my rogue is a worgen and the helm looks insanely retarded on them.Really like the priest, lock, druid, and hunter sets. Priest is the best imo.Shaman looks good except some of the alternate sets colors look bad. Mage is interesting, would like it better if they wore the goggles.</div></div><hr />

PLEASE don't use humans for presenting new armor tiers anymore. I am serious, they make the armor look much uglier than they actually are. Use elves, orcs even draenei. If you want clarity go with another straight standing race like night or blood elves, but please not this weird looking boxy model with an unnatural pose.</div></div><hr />

Runners up are Warlock and Priest who can leave their hats on *wink*. I might bump up the Shaman to my upper tier once I see it on my Orc friend, but I wager it will look silly on other races. Honorable lawls go to ghetto-stitched Batman, poor DKs who waited weeks for another skull outfit that a seventh grader drew on his binder because it's &quot;metal,&quot; and Warrior not so much because it's an unoriginal design, but because it will badly suffer from the fact that everything other than Chest/Helms in WoW are close to spandex and it won't fit the bulky Deathwing motif in game.</div></div><hr />

I think you have way too high demands. That priest set is the best I've seen since priest tier 5! Always thought of the priest sets as boring but this one is really interesting.</div></div><hr />
