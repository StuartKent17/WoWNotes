So you say dps shamans are underperforming yet you nerf enhances set bonus? Logic much?<br />
If it was a badly tuned for Ret, it was badly tuned for Enhance. We can find another way to help. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/543183048116674561))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Will we be able to purchase conquest gear with honor after earning 27,000 conquest for the season?<br />
no. That was primarily for offsets and the gear just changes now. Unnecessary going forward. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/543425574543577088))<br />
<br />
Suggest making PvP trinket set bonus a buff on player so it's possible to choose targets accordingly.Take advantage of no setbonus<br />
you just want transparency of the bonus? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/543536897075585024))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
I get that people asked for it, but if you can buy both then why bother with choices/branching paths at all?<br />
You can't swap till you finish the zone and hit max level, still a decent amount of time with that bldg (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/543301196543307776))<br />

So frustrated at Apexis dailies. Spend 90% of my time running around trying to tag a mob. So is everyone else. Can we at least share the elites? Would make it feel more like joining a battle than competing to push a button first.<br />
Try joining a group! Use the new Group-Finder button to join a group in progress doing that content. Give it a try! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/543117573483544577))<br />

<br />
Joining a raid group gives you up to 40 times better chance to tag a mob, as opposed to solo. Not using the systems in place to their full potential is your choice. Deal with the consequences.</div></div><hr />

it is a fucking MMO game, you are bound to do some group activities, if you dont like it go play skyrim.<br />

The issue is both times I went for a GF pre-made, there were &quot;up to 40 players&quot; roaming all over the place, so one had to keep one's eyes glued on the mini-map to see where at least SOME others may be somewhat close to where you are. More chasing to find others than actual killing. Fortunately, most of the time I can rouse a few guildies to do a much more satisfying and focused 3-4 person group.</div></div><hr />

WoW...just WoW. I play on a high pop server....and guess what I do...if its really crowded I whisper a few people near me to see if they want to group up (1 or 2 people at most). Its not that hard to do. And there has only been one time when there have been huge numbers of players in the daily area and guess what I got invited to join a large group because some good old fashioned world pvp broke out...and it was actually fun<br />
<br />
You can complain about a lot of things in the game but occasionally having to whisper someone to see if they want to group up, let alone joining a larger group, really isn't one of them. THIS IS AN MMO FFS. Get over yourselves.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jasper Kazai</div><div class="date">2014-12-20, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been doing the apexis daily with a friend every day since we hit 100. Until last week we just did the two of us. Now we use the group finder. Never have had any issue with it, and it takes like 5-10 minutes. Every group I've gotten into does have a few people spread out here and there, but the bulk of everyone is in one area. Anyways, what I'm saying here is that the issues people are having with group finder groups are not necessarily commonplace.<br />
They do need to change how often the dailies rotate, though. It's been the Shattrath group daily on my server for well over a week now, every day. And the 800 daily has been Darktide Roost for the past 4 days. Still need two other dailies to finish that achievement for doing all of them.<br />

<br />
That's my tweet.<br />
<br />
Not only did I think of joining a group, I actually run these with my guild as much as possible. I don't know why Dave responded the way he did. My comments are about the immersion of the activity. Running around playing the mob tagging Olympics, even in a group, isn't immersive or fun to me.<br />
<br />
The point of these activities is to make you feel like you're joining a big battle against an enemy. What it actually feels like is you're joining a big battle to compete against other players tagging and wiping out helpless mobs as soon as they spawn.<br />
<br />
I'd urge you to read the full Twitter conversation in order to get the context.</div></div><hr />

First of all, there needs to be TWO &quot;solo&quot; option AND ONE &quot;group&quot; option EVERY DAY. The population NEEDS to be spread out. To all those saying join a group...1) that doesn't always help due to massive number of people / bad spawn rates depending on the daily and 2) When does the SOLO option mean group required?? The absolute worst cluster@#$#$ of all is the day it is so small solo area like MAgnarok and then @#$ing Ashran. So basically 95% of the server (or more) is funneled into one tiny area with @#$#@ spawn rates because no one wants to wait 5 hours to get into Ashran. With very few exceptions, I stopped doing the apexis dailies weeks ago - not worth the hassle. I get my 800/week on all my alts from campaign quest...maybe a rare garrison mission and call it a day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are aware DPS meters work cumulatively right?<br />
<br />
On single target phases (which are rare) shaman is probably doing quite a bit less DPS than the others but the the total time of these phases is not enough for others to catch up to him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not garbage on single target. If you saw Devai streaming their butcher kill you would know. Sure there are classes that do slightly more dps, and bring more to the raid in general but saying enhance (or any other class/spec) is garbage is just stupid.</div></div><hr />

Actually, 0.0044% of people seem to care! (estimating the world's population at 6.916 x 10^9 and assuming all 304610 views on youtube are different people) :cool:</div></div><hr />
