Pet Battle Accuracy Changes in Patch 5.3<br />
Greetings, trainers!<br />
<br />
We wanted to take a moment to discuss some of the broad accuracy changes we’re making to Pet Battles in patch 5.3. The overarching goal behind these changes is to provide transparency to reduce the amount of uncontrolled randomness, where one miss often makes or breaks a match. Once patch 5.3 is live, you’ll see “hit chance” listed for all abilities, and this value will update if the pet is affected by abilities that increase or reduce the chance to hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/april/thumb/pba01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/april/pba01.jpg) <br />
<br />
In addition, we’ve removed the base 5% chance to dodge, and reduced the chance to miss opponents of higher levels from 5% per level to 2% per level. The end result should be that your attacks that should hit, will hit, and there’s greater incentive to get out there and fight higher-level pets for greater experience rewards.<br />
<br />
In a turn-based game, randomness can be a lot of fun if handled correctly. Without a little randomness, the outcome of a match could be predicted to a high degree of certainty before the first swing, and that’s no fun. Randomness often works best when it is opt-in, often in exchange for greater attack power, longer duration, etc. In fact, many higher-damage battle pet abilities already had a reduced chance to hit, which will now be visible.<br />
<br />
With the removal of the base dodge chance, we were left with a large number of abilities that now had a 100% hit chance. We’ve made a handful of minor modifications to some of these abilities, giving them greater damage in exchange for a reduced chance to hit. It’s worth noting that every battle pet type (e.g. Dragonkin) have at least one ability that hits 100% of the time, allowing you to opt-out of the randomness if you prefer a less risky strategy. (Check out the full list of basic abilities that have gained additional damage in exchange for reduced accuracy below.)<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/april/thumb/pba02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/april/pba02.jpg) <br />
<br />
Finally, we’ve left the base 5% chance to gain a critical strike (for 1.5x damage), and +/- 10% damage variance on all abilities, at least for the time being. We believe that getting a crit generally feels good, and the damage variance is often enough to make a match a bit less predetermined without swinging the match heavily in one player’s favor.<br />
<br />
We also wanted to thank the community for the great feedback we’ve gotten so far about Pet Battles. Keep it coming!<br />
<br />
As noted earlier, the following basic attacks have had their damage increased by 5-15% and accuracy reduced by 5-15%:<br />

Ra-den, the bonus final boss on Heroic mode.<br />
<br />
Also, both Method and Blood Legion have rather misleading titles. Not technically lying due to mentioning 25 man, but they seem to be ignoring the fact Paragon is actually World First. But let's not start another pointless argument, since Wrath of the Lich King ended nearly 4 years ago.</div></div><hr />

As much as I hate to use the comparison, you've never played pokemon have you? Super-effective (double damage vs a certain type) has always been a part of monster hunters or pet battles. So has everything else you claim is BS except for dodging dots. That might be bs.</div></div><hr />

Also for the hardcore brown nosers,note how method nearly all died and how blood legion had a vast majority still up,2nd best maybe but i think they should be joint top for having more people alive.<br />
<br />
Thats the excuse people who horribly fail in game always use, to dimish someone else achievement. Sorry, bro.. most people I know, including myself, who raid hardcore or above average are smart, laid and have/will have a well paid job.<br />
<br />
As for the kill, while BLs was much cleaner you've to remember that Method did it one lockout prior to BL. I'm sure if BL had a lucky try like Method got, it'd look the same due to the lack of gear.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure Blood Legion had an additional reset to gear compared to Method. Might make a bigger difference than you think.</div></div><hr />

Super-effective (double damage vs a certain type) has always been a part of monster hunters or pet battles. So has everything else you claim is BS except for dodging dots. That might be bs.<br />
<br />
I meant getting misses/dodges against those moves (eg. the extra dmg not being dealt cos they're treated as 2 separate attacks or hibernating bears dodging), not the moves themselves.</div></div><hr />

Players starting on Cataclysm content can purchase level-80 gear from Iris Moonweaver in Hyjal and Erunak in Vashj'ir to more easily qualify for Blackrock Caverns and Abyssal Maw: Throne of Tides.<br />
<br />
<br />
I commented to Blizzard a few months in to Cataclysm about the issue of item level and the starter Cataclysm dungeons - how difficult it was to make the jump from Wrath item level to Cata item level in order for LFD to allow the character to queue - using my goblin hunter as an example. I was shouted down by other forum goers telling me to form a guild group or buy gear from the AH (neither of which were actual solutions, merely band-aids to address the symptoms of the actual problem).<br />
<br />
Sweet, sweet vindication. *basks in self-satisfied glow for a couple of minutes*<br />
<br />
Of course, this should have been done years ago.<br />
<br />
Also, is the Curse survey truly already closed? It hasn't been available for long at all. Survey is working now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aside from by biased perception it looks like a very challenging fight for players who have no been playing that long. Looks like the the emperor from star wars as a mogu.<br />
<br />
Watching a top guild do a fight isn't a valid way to judge it, as you're obviously seeing their best attempt on the fight and not the endless wiping they had to get to that point. I mean the very fact that Method in their video are so relaxed the first two phases is due to them doing those two phases so many times they know it by heart. <br />
<br />
Overall it's a well designed fight. Very tight enrage mechanics for transitions and, as all good fights, it has abilities that tests a raider's individual skill and not always just the raid as a whole.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Always wanted to know what 25 virgins screaming out loud sounded like&quot; <br />
<br />
That's a bit of a peculiar thing to say, if you think that's normal you should see a psychiatrist or I feel you'll end up in prison in a few years.<br />
<br />
Anyway, grats to Method proving that hardcore raiding can be fun!</div></div><hr />

But you could have saved yourself a lot of time by recording yourself screaming and played it back a few times. I'm sure you scream yourself to sleep so it wouldn't require too much extra effort.</div></div><hr />
