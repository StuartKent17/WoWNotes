Armory Stats - Ashran<br />
Today we are taking a look at some Ashran achievement stats. The total sample used was 3.1 million players in the US and EU. As always, keep in mind that this isn't every single player, so the numbers aren't perfect. <br />
<br />
Feel free to leave suggestions and requests for stats you want to see in the comments.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP Feedback<br />
I see my &quot;why do you play Heroes but not WoW PvP&quot; tweet appeared on MMO-C. I'd like to clear up a few things. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/578961878598033408))<br />
We very much value highly committed PvP players and their feedback about game balance is invaluable. Thank you for all your help. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/578962129320943616))<br />
My original question was specifically directed at people who I would have thought don't PvP in WoW because they don't like PvP games. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/578962376751370240))<br />
A side conversation happened and I probably didn't communicate with that person properly about how we do think balance is very important. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/578962546343874561))<br />
Anyway, we are always striving to make a great game for you to play and we do very much appreciate your support. Thanks. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/578967844248899584))<br />
I'd also like to add I received lots of great insight from my original question, so thank you. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/578967844248899584))<br />

Game Design<br />
It's been said before - an idea is only as good as your ability to execute on it, or get other people passionate about it. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/576968152963112960))<br />
In my experience, real talent often comes in recognizing the great ideas that will fit cleanly with the rest of your game. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/576968227445592064))<br />
And good designers know how to let ideas go quickly and keep looking, rather than getting attached to something with too much baggage. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/576968360178536449))<br />
This year, I'm going to challenge myself to get a lot of ideas out, to learn to sell them in a small space (gg twitter), and to let them go. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/576968612033863681))<br />
They won't all be great and I don't care if you don't like them. Hopefully some inspire something. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/576968739502968832))<br />
<br />
It's all or nothing. One guided goal sets an expectation for structure vs. fully free-form.<br />
Yeah, that's usually the case. You can tutorialize without specific goals though. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/577214263258800128))<br />
And I personally think there are ways to set long term goals without explicitly spelling out the game along the way. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/577214428036218880))<br />
I know you can't talk WoW but this is the exact issue why I don't like the Apexis hubs. No framing device (text). No fun.<br />
Yeah, WoW has set an expectation for information that makes open POIs and puzzles prone to feel uncomfortable. Hard problem. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/577215581918646272))<br />
I think THAT comes down to pace. When you have a cinematic flow driven by story, sudden halts in game play are jarring.<br />
That's fair. Taking control of the camera from the players is easy to make painful if done in the wrong place or too often. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/577219703543717889))<br />
<br />
Adding explicit hand-held goals to an open world game fundamentally changes the way players experience it. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/577212119692619776))<br />
It changes the pace, the potential emotional investment, the expectations. It's a legitimate approach, but it's a dramatic design choice. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/577212885681586176))<br />
I'm very interested in seeing more devs hold back in the hand-holding. On-board players gently, but let them unfold the game on their own. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/577213249613000704))<br />
I wish the dev teams for CoD and BF would understand that. they don't even let you open your own doors.<br />
Hah! Yeah. It's somewhat core identity for them though. Extremely approachable and very cinematic. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/577217060096241664))<br />
Yeah, I'm probably not the target audience for those games. I prefer long SP campaigns because I don't do MP apart from WoW/HS.<br />
Yeah, I can identify with that. I like CoD campaigns, but I LOVE a nice long campaign of Fallout: New Vegas. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/577221579223867392))<br />

Also thats not a pvp zone, its a whatever-zone, with no rewards and people just run here and there til they die from something and return to the base. I used to enter Ashran before the reset ever Tuesday, sticked around till i had 4000/4000 honor(about an hour or so) just so i could exchange it for Seal of Tempered Fate.

At the start of the xpac, the 660 conquest gear was really good at the time and was competitive with other sources, especially with some classes having good PVP set bonuses on top of that</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost1987</div><div class="date">2015-03-21, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They tried to recreate world pvp via Ashran but it's still not the same as it was in Vanilla and here are my reasons.<br />
<br />
Back in vanilla, world pvp was usually in any questing zone and usually began with a 1v1 encounter. I played a druid at the time so I was able to scout out where the players were quickly. Anyway, once we began to fight, it became personal as they'd call in some of their friends or utilized the local defense chat. Then I'd call in some of my friends or used the local defense chat and we'd be fighting for hours protecting our egos. In Ashran, it's too anonymous so if you die, you don't necessarily have the urge to find some way to retaliate because you're mainly killing and looting. I also enjoyed how the local defense chat worked because it listed your PvP title before your name so you can gauge the caliber of player that is having trouble or is responding to a help call. For instance, if a high warlord asked for help on local defense, you can safely make the assumption that he is getting outnumbered as opposed to a scout who might just be having a problem with 1v1.<br />
<br />
I don't think I've ever met one person who likes to get bulldozed by 10 players at once but that's generally the case if you stray away from any of the groups. There's no environment to begin a personal vendetta against someone because everyone stays in packs. You're either bulldozing others or getting bulldozed and that's not really entertaining.<br />
<br />
Holinka asks why people don't PvP. Well, as someone who only does PvE now, have a few reasons for that.<br />
<br />
Originally, I got into WoW for the PvP. I geared myself up in PvP gear so I could go harass the opposing faction in world pvp settings. I didn't really care much for organized pvp, although AV was pretty fun due to its suspenseful nature at the time. Maybe I was on more of a balanced server back then, but I used to see the opposing faction quite often while travelling through a zone. Now, the servers are either horde dominant or alliance dominant so it's a rare occasion that you come across someone from the opposing faction to PvP. Unless I want to do organized PvP, I don't really have much use for the PvP gear anymore. PvP gear was like a concealed weapon for me, if I felt that I was going to engage in PvP soon, i'd swap to my PvP set just to be ready.<br />
<br />
Organized PvP is pretty bland. The bgs are creative but it still has that bulldoze element to it. You're either the team doing the bulldozing or you're getting bulldozed. There's not a lot of freedom of choice because you pretty much have to stick with your group or get picked off as a straggler. For premade PvP such as arenas or RBGs, the community there seems to be a little childish. In RBGs, everyone seems to forget that they're adults and spend the entire time screaming in vent or mumble. Arenas can be fun but it's discouraging if your arena partner stops playing the game for a little bit and then you're left to have to find a new arena partner who you have to establish that synergy with again. In PvE, you don't really need synergy, you just have to know your role and the mechanics. If everyone knows their part then the bosses go down so I find that PvE is easier to get into.<br />
<br />
Anyway, long post but these are my thoughts about the whole ordeal.</div></div><hr />

Curiosity. Alliance has insta-queue (and had the bopss on farm) and Horde controls events. &quot;Just for me&quot; gets itself real easy, and 1st degree is easy since its just like, an hour of killing and everyone was fighting at the beginning. I guess the numbers drop dramatically over time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
of course the graph isnt a good measuring stick but look at the one achievement that actually involves pvp. the kill 5000 players achievement and look at how low the percentage is of people who have it.<br />
<br />
it doesnt appear many people actually pvp in the zone, theyre only there to get the quests done and leave. too much pve involved. i could very well be wrong but i bet if there were similar statistics/achievements from wintergrasp they would be much higher because the pvp action of wintergrasp went hand in hand with how the zone operated.<br />
<br />
they apparently tried to emulate the feel of AV and if they took a step back and looked at it for what it was they would have realized AV is very similar. people will go out of their way to avoid pvp combat in that bg because its pointless to engage in it. the groups ride past each other and try to kill the pve boss as quickly as possible. only when they change marshalls/warmasters to hit ridiculously strong why the towers were still up did people take the time to cap objectives. once people outgeared the pve encounter AND they nerfed the damage marshalls/warmasters do people again began skipping objectives and tunneling on the pve boss.<br />
<br />
tldr - heavy pve objectives in a pvp zone severely diminishes any chance of pvp happening.</div></div><hr />

Killing (and looting) was practically the only way to gain honor and reputation, so it indeed revolved around killing the opposing faction. Winning was a bonus mainly for faction bragging rights in your server, and most did not expect to win, or even see the game end, when they entered AV. Old school pvp players had also a quite different mindset, as everything did not have to lead to a flashing text and some numbers to be fun. Competition was embraced more than easy loots. To be fair to the newer players, server transfers, faction transfers, easy alts etc. have all contributed to this downfall quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I don't think the game currently works well with large scale AV-style zerg. Too much movement skills, cc and aoe to have any decent structure in the fight. So unless they are ready to do very heavy ability pruning, Tol Barad like design, where you have multiple smaller battles going on at the same time, works better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don´t think you can compare the two. GC helped bring in a lot of the really good stuff like ´bring the player not the class´ and LFD, which made the game much more accessible and fun.<br />
<br />
The new pvp dev has not done anything except botched Ashran to hell. There has been no improvements to anything pvp related in the game, they reverted some stuff and go back and forth on stuff like resilience and gear, but nothing good has been added and the world pvp he designed is worse than Tol Borad and drastically worse than Wintergrasp and even most battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
I occasionally disagreed with GC, but 95% of the stuff he said was dead on, and the stuff he pushed to be added to the game made it better.<br />

<br />
To me, that means that early on people were trying it out, but not many went back in after 6.1 to get the previously bugged Victory one. It was fixed with the deployment of 6.1.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;Divide and Conquer&quot;, personally I'm at 3k of 5k kills, and I spend about 1.5 - 2 hours a week in there working on it. It is taking awhile because it's fairly rare for the opposing side to actually show up and fight. That one, and the Bounty Hunter one, are the only ones I haven't finished. I won't be able to finish Bounty Hunter until they fix the Forsaken brains drop issue.</div></div><hr />

It's hard to design anything good, as you have to get it right at the first time, because the players, in large, are completely unable to adapt. I mean, lot of people still think that they should be killing the boss in Ashran, and some who realize it's not so anymore, miss killing the boss instead of pvp'ing. <br />
<br />
They've been doing all the right things in theory, like cutting down cc, instant casts, gear scaling for wpvp, but when people tell you they are not going to Ashran because they can't pve their way to conquest gear or because they lose everytime and don't know why or are unable to do anything about, you know it's about the playerbase as much as designers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A couple things:<br />
1) I'm aware it's not an easy job<br />
2) It's not a job I want<br />
3) 1 and 2 taken into consideration...<br />
3.1) He's not doing a very good job at it, so why does the vitriol surprise anybody? Ashran has failed for numerous reasons, the least of which being that people couldn't even get into it, or queues were hours long, etc...<br />
<br />
The HOTS/WoW-pvp comparison was pretty absurd to begin with, imo.<br />
<br />
ALL THAT SAID...<br />
A) He's using his own twitter account to talk WoW. It's the internet--you want to put the gloves on, be ready to take some punches.<br />
B) As long as they gate gear behind pvp, there will be issues. <br />
<br />
If they really wanted to remove all of that from pvp, they could remove gear entirely from PvP. Everybody steps into pvp/flags and their ilvl instantly goes to X value.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Shambulanced,&quot; you say, &quot;that removes the incentive from pvp!&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Without those incentives (keep achieves though, for bragging rights) you get down to PvP for the sake of PvP--for the thrill and challenge. There's no more farming, no more points, no more caps. Players fighting on even ground. <br />
<br />
What grows in the absence of points/gear? Your own skill and statistics. And now things like events, lane versus events, duping BGs for fast honor/conq, etc, become moot. People are there to battle each other.<br />

I'm probably crazy for thinking that's how it should be.</div></div><hr />

It would be a waste to delete it. However, turning it into a Timeless Isle sort of zone without the flagging would make it more useful. It would need some work to do it but a lot of what's there is OK now for PVE.<br />

Well then why the hell would they be playing HoTS???<br />
Well, HotS is a game designed around PVP from the start. WoW is not. That's why.</div></div><hr />

At least on Alliance side, that achieve is broken - undead brains do not drop at all. I don't know if it's doable Horde side or not.</div></div><hr />

Except Ashran was supposedly why we didn't get new BGs for the first time ever. So you're basically advocating that the broken mess PvP players did get instead gets turned into PvE stuff and the PvP players get left hung out dry.</div></div><hr />

1) I'm aware it's not an easy job<br />
2) It's not a job I want<br />
3) 1 and 2 taken into consideration...<br />
3.1) He's not doing a very good job at it, so why does the vitriol surprise anybody? Ashran has failed for numerous reasons, the least of which being that people couldn't even get into it, or queues were hours long, etc...<br />
<br />
The HOTS/WoW-pvp comparison was pretty absurd to begin with, imo.<br />
<br />
ALL THAT SAID...<br />
A) He's using his own twitter account to talk WoW. It's the internet--you want to put the gloves on, be ready to take some punches.<br />
B) As long as they gate gear behind pvp, there will be issues. <br />
<br />
If they really wanted to remove all of that from pvp, they could remove gear entirely from PvP. Everybody steps into pvp/flags and their ilvl instantly goes to X value.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Shambulanced,&quot; you say, &quot;that removes the incentive from pvp!&quot;<br />
<br />
That's a fair and accurate statement, except I believe the people who enjoy pvp the most are those who would still pvp anyway, regardless of gear rewards. They are the true Mythic Raiders of pvping. <br />

First time Ive ever said this on MMOC but great post. Id be more than happy to PVP without gear rewards. its all I do in this horrible game now anyways is PVP (and NOT ashram)<br />

Shudder is there anything you actually like in WOW? All you do is cry. You must get ganked a lot IRL and in game.</div></div><hr />
