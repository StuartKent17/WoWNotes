The following bug fixes to Val'kyr Twins were just deployed, and they will increase the overall difficulty of the encounter. 
 
Surge of Light and Surge of Darkness were not being cast properly on Normal difficulties. 
Light Vortex was doing less damage than Dark Vortex. 
 
Along with those two major bug fixes, we also increased the rate with which the Concentrated Light and Concentrated Darkness spawns.

<br />
Along with those two major bug fixes, we also increased the rate with which the Concentrated Light and Concentrated Darkness spawns. <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 3.2.2 - Onyxia's Head Questline<br />
The Head of Onyxia (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49643/head-of-onyxia/) was added to the game in the latest PTR build, the new quest is A Puzzling Circumstance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24428/a-most-puzzling-circumstance/) / A Puzzling Circumstance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24429/a-most-puzzling-circumstance/) and the rewards are :<br />
<br />
Sparkling Onyxia Tooth Pendant (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49485/sparkling-onyxia-tooth-pendant/)<br />
Polished Dragonslayer's Signet (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49486/polished-dragonslayers-signet/)<br />
Purified Onyxia Blood Talisman (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49487/purified-onyxia-blood-talisman/)<br />
<br />
All these rewards are level 245 and currently the head seems to drop in both 10-Man and 25-Man difficulty modes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Trial of the Coliseum Hard Modes<br />
In the Trial of the Grand Crusader (ie Heroic Trial of the Crusader) you have 50 attempts total before you may no longer attempt encounters for that week. Example time!<br />
<br />
Example 1:<br />
If you spent 39 attempts on the Northrend Beasts encounter, you would have 11 attempts left to try Lord Jaraxxus. If Lord Jaraxxus was then beaten after 5 attempts, you would have 6 attempts left for Faction Champions and the other remaining encounters.<br />
<br />
Example 2:<br />
If you wiped 50 times on the Northrend Beasts, then you're done for the week.<br />
<br />
Example 3:<br />
If you didn't wipe on Northrend Beasts, Lord Jaraxxus, Faction Champions, or Val'kyr Twins, you would have all 50 attempts available for the final boss. <br />
<br />

Arthas and Deathwing<br />
Arthas tends to be considered the biggest force of destruction in the universe because he is very fresh in peoples' minds based on being fairly recently introduced through Warcraft 3 and staring everybody down since then. Remember though that even to break away from the control of the Burning Legion, it required a great deal of cunning and manipulation - he wasn't able to simply overpower them.<br />
<br />
Deathwing on the other hand is a much more legendary figure and one of the greatest powers ever to exist on Azeroth. It took the might of all the other dragon aspects against him to force him into hiding. He also knows almost every being on the world will be against him so he wouldn't reveal himself unless he felt ready to take on anything that will face him.

Cataclysm Alt Friendly?<br />
Cataclysm is pretty alt friendly over all. We'll do things that encourage and facilitate alts when it makes sense. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19381854929-titans-path-explanation-please.html))<br />
<br />
Ancient Glyphs level requirements<br />
You have to be 85. Our plan is to tie it to Archaeology, but that could change. While fishing can be challenging to max out, cooking isn't all that hard and first aid is pretty easy. Archaeology could be anywhere in there. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19381854929-titans-path-explanation-please.html))<br />
<br />
Path of the Titans &quot;gating&quot;<br />
We're saying even if someone beats you to level 85, they can't get very far ahead of you on paths. Imagine that when a new rank is available, the previous rank becomes half price or something. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19381854929-titans-path-explanation-please.html))<br />
<br />
Orgrimmar destroyed in the expansion?<br />
Orgrimmar destroyed? No. Given a bit of a make-over and a bit more iron in its spine (so to speak)? Yes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19381856421-ogrimarr-being-trashed-in-cataclysm.html))<br />
<br />
Cross-server Instances and rewards as a leader<br />
This was a bit of a miscomm. The idea is that you would be rewarded for trying to use LFG to form a group. A separate feature of LFG is that we allow players to identify whether they are comfortable leading the group or not and then we try to make sure each group has at least one leader. You are probably going to have a much worse experience joining a pug of 5 players when none of them know anything about the encounters.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of drama would result from arguing over who should be leader if that incurred extra rewards, as well as encouraging players with no business doing so to lead. Really, the focus should be on the group. The leader just marks (though everyone could do that too) and describes the fights. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19377465474-group-leader-reward.html))<br />
<br />
Low level PvP rewards no longer sold by the Officer Accessories Quartermaster<br />
This flew under the radar for a little bit, but Master Sergeant Biggins should be selling those accessories again in 3.2.2. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/19377456025-allied-off-accessories-qmaster-not-selling.html))<br />
<br />
Path of the titans<br />
They are intended to be gated, not grindy. The idea is more that you have a reason to keep coming back to log in even if say you need a break from raiding or it isn't your team's PvP night. We are trying to contrast them with actual levels, which players can blow through very quickly if they are dedicated.

Blizzcon - Battle.net in WoW<br />
I didn't have much time to talk about it during the week-end but in the future, Battle.net will be upgraded to support a lot of extra features. Some of them will affect World of Warcraft and players will eventually be forced to upgrade their WoW account to Battle.net accounts to support them, see the FAQ below for more information. <br />
<br />
What is the new Battle.net?<br />
We are building the new Battle.net to be the premier online gaming destination. The new Battle.net experience is a full-featured online game service designed specifically around Blizzard Entertainment titles, and will include a complete set of around-the-game features including a state-of-the-art matchmaking system, achievement system, social networking features, structured competitive play options, a marketplace, and much more. Our vision is to create an environment where gamers can compete online, develop an online persona, and stay connected to friends and the rest of the community while enjoying our games. In doing this, the new Battle.net will deliver the ultimate social and competitive experience for Blizzard Entertainment gamers everywhere.<br />
<br />
What is the history of Battle.net?<br />
Battle.net was the world’s first fully integrated matchmaking service, which we launched in 1996 with the release of Diablo. Battle.net evolved over the years to fully incorporate online gameplay for StarCraft, Diablo II, a re-release of Warcraft II, and Warcraft III. The Battle.net system has been in its current form, without major changes, since 2003. <br />
<br />
What is the Real ID feature? <br />
Real ID is at the forefront of online gaming as it will allow you to easily connect, communicate, and play with real-life friends. Connect with old friends and current guildies, and make new friends with the integrated Battle.net social networking tools. Beyond simply seeing your friend’s character names (e.g. “Gorlac” in World of Warcraft or “Snip3r” in StarCraft II), and having to remember which character name goes with which friend, you will be able to see your Real ID friend and chat with him or her across Blizzard games. What’s more, Real ID is totally optional -- the options are there for you to build your Blizzard Entertainment social network however you see fit. <br />
<br />
What are some of the communication tools available in the new Battle.net?<br />
Our vision is for the new Battle.net to become the ultimate Blizzard Entertainment social network, in addition to its matchmaking foundation. Simply logging in to Battle.net will make it easy to find and chat with your friends across World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, and future Blizzard Entertainment titles, including Diablo III. Keep track of all your buddies in your friends list, view their online status and presence information, voice chat, send out party invites, and broadcast messages to your friends. Detailed character profiles let players keep up to date on friends’ progress and achievements. <br />
<br />
Will classic Blizzard Entertainment games be supported on the new Battle.net?<br />
We do eventually plan to update all classic Battle.net games to take advantage of the new Battle.net accounts and server infrastructure. Beyond this, we do not have anything to announce today regarding legacy Blizzard Entertainment titles and the new Battle.net experience. <br />
<br />
Will a forced migration to Battle.net occur for World of Warcraft players?<br />
Yes, sometime in the near future, it will be necessary for all World of Warcraft subscribers to transition their accounts to the new Battle.net system. Those players who have already converted to the new system will be able to take part in the new Battle.net features soon. <br />
<br />
What will change in World of Warcraft after the forced migration?<br />
The core gameplay experience will remain unchanged as a result of the migration. However, you’ll be able to take part in all of the new Battle.net features, such as cross-realm, cross-faction, and cross-game chat. <br />

Battle.Net will be free to use, as it has been for over 10 years. They said they're going to do like what they did with WoW, having optional features that will require money<br />

<br />
<br />
You obviously haven't ever play on Battle.net. WoW is the only Blizzard game that you can't talk to each other across games (or realms really). Saying that Battle.Net is a blizzard themed steam is unfounded.<br />
<br />
On a side note, Blizzard/Activision/Valve/Vivendi have teamed up at one point and have had disagreements</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is a part of the &quot;real life friends&quot; friend list thingie.<br />
Meaning, someone asks for permission to add you, and you have to agree to add them.<br />
Then you get to see their status regardless of which alt/realm/game they're on, and you'll be able to chat to them as well.<br />
From what they said at blizzcon, it'll be like adding someone to MSN messenger or whatever.<br />
For people you want to be able to hide from, there will still be the old style friends list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I understand, &quot;Real ID&quot; is set by the person who put you on their friends list.

<br />
alright question....does this mean that it will be available as a seperate chat on battle.net, or that you will be able to do this within game (i.e. you can be on wow and talk to horde while you're playing ally or vice versa).<br />
<br />
and if this means that you can do it within wow, does anyone else see this as a bad idea? or am i reading it wrong and it will be limited to a &quot;friends list&quot; that you create on battle.net?<br />

i'm hoping i am reading it wrong, i'm really really hoping i'm reading it wrong.</div></div><hr />

I imagine you'll only be able to cross-faction chat with people who have mutually agreed to be on your Battle.net friends list.<br />

It's about damn time. I wonder if it will be easy to add the player to my bnet friend list just from in-game UI though. I don't want to alt-tab (or basically go into bnet UI instead of WoW UI) with opposing faction being so close to me, even if I'm trying to communicate to them.</div></div><hr />

What else is necessary to &quot;lead&quot; a 5-man heroic pug? Hell, you don't even need to mark stuff and usually simply zerging the boss works just fine. Raids are a different story, but they're completely unrelated since cross-server lfg will only be for 5-man dungeons, atleast for now.</div></div><hr />

Light Vortex was doing less damage than Dark Vortex.<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
No it's not. Not in this case.<br />
The fact of the matter is that the city planning of Orgrimmar has no system, and makes no real sense as opposed to both Stormwind and Ironforge.<br />
<br />
Ironforge:<br />
Circular district design. Crafting professions in the middle at and around the great forge, class trainers and relevant vendors have their districts, or wards, in the outer rings. Example: The warriors/hunters have their trainer in the Military Ward, where battlemasters and weapon/armor vendors also reside. This is also the location for the training dummies. Tinker town has the Tram, engineers and similar. The commons contain the everyday needs of the people through AH, Bank, Inn ++. And on it goes.<br />
<br />
Stormwind:<br />
Once again, district based layout. Here they have added a city river to separate the areas. Old town is the elder rebuilt part of stormwind, and it is here that the warriors ++ reside. The SI:7 and Army Keep thingy (can't remember, i play horde) + other war related vendors are in here, like weapon and armor vendors for most classes. Trade district is basically the same as The Commons in IF. Cathedral Square deals with holy classes, like priests and paladins and other humanitarian organizations, aswell as one weapon shop, basically selling paladin weapons so.<br />
<br />
Orgrimmar:<br />
No real design. Valley of Strength is basically a bunch of burrows placed randomly around in a ravine. Contains the AH and Bank. Dark people go into Cleft of Shadow (Rogue, Warlock), Spiritual/holy people in the Valley of Wisdom(Shaman/Paladin), Holy/Arcane got their own little hut on the way out the backdoor.(Priest, Mage), Valley of Honor got the rest(Warrior, Hunter.) VoH also contains a lake with a fisher, engineers, and ofc the usual people affilated with warriors. If you look at the layout, you can obviously seen that they just found a big ravine and started raising buildings where they saw fit. The actual road system is poorly planned. House placement is completely random. Alot of vendors and profession trainers seem randomly placed.<br />
<br />
My point is that even though you get used to it and might find out that you are more familiar in Org than in IF and SW (Which is up to the every single person). The design of SW and IF far surpasses Org, regardless of what any person says anywhere.</div></div><hr />

Yes, thank you, in fact every city makes sense but Orgrimmar, so I'm happy they're using the cataclysm as a reason to rethink things.<br />

This was a bit of a miscomm. The idea is that you would be rewarded for trying to use LFG to form a group. A separate feature of LFG is that we allow players to identify whether they are comfortable leading the group or not and then we try to make sure each group has at least one leader. You are probably going to have a much worse experience joining a pug of 5 players when none of them know anything about the encounters.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of drama would result from arguing over who should be leader if that incurred extra rewards, as well as encouraging players with no business doing so to lead. Really, the focus should be on the group. The leader just marks (though everyone could do that too) and describes the fights. (Source)<br />

Well, I wouldn't say awful. But yes, this, basically. If they made it so everyone had a reward, each quest would have a choice of 19 items. <br />
<br />
You don't complain when a quest in Barrens gives Mail/Cloth with no Shaman pieces, so why is this quest any different?</div></div><hr />

actually Orgrimmar is easy to navigate, if you're smart at it that is. In the end it navigates just like Stormwind where everything is sectioned off and shares a theme.<br />
<br />
Now undercity can be a bit retarded in the sense that its a circle, easy right? No. It is not like Ironforge. Ironforge has signs everywhere to tell you what stores and venders are and even road signs to the great forge (lol). UC does a fail job because when you need a shop vender there is no sign pointing out so you can see it and the're not themed based on location. Dont even get me started about UC only having 10 guards and one mail box --___--.... there's like 8 mail boxes in Stormwind now and 2 are like 20yrds from each other!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How long haven't you bean in the Undercity? It has about 50 mail boxes, and the best part is, some are placed right next to the auctioneers, which makes mounted auctions faster as it was done in Thunder Bluff before - Orgrimmar however fails in that department since you still get dismounted when you enter the AH. <br />
<br />
About the layout and memorizing. It's the same with all cities, markings in UC are just the same as everywhere else, it's a little trickier since it has the same textures all over the circle, unlike Ironforge where you don't need markings, but know where you are because of the different textures depending on the section of it.<br />
<br />
However, with no dismounting anywhere, mail boxes across the whole city, the Undercity is indeed the fastest one to navigate and get the job done - for example from wherever you are you have to spent the same amount of time getting to the lifts, flight master, bank, auction house... not so with every single other city horde or alliance.<br />
<br />
The guards have also been patched, I see some seekers running round in the ruins nowdays, but yeah guards are a major problem in any city or outpost in the game, they're way to low level, should be quite higher, so that it requires at least a party to get them down.</div></div><hr />

What is the new Battle.net?<br />
We are building the new Battle.net to be the premier online gaming destination. The new Battle.net experience is a full-featured online game service designed specifically around Blizzard Entertainment titles, and will include a complete set of around-the-game features including a state-of-the-art matchmaking system, achievement system, social networking features, structured competitive play options, a marketplace, and much more. Our vision is to create an environment where gamers can compete online, develop an online persona, and stay connected to friends and the rest of the community while enjoying our games. In doing this, the new Battle.net will deliver the ultimate social and competitive experience for Blizzard Entertainment gamers everywhere.<br />
<br />
What is the history of Battle.net?<br />
Battle.net was the world’s first fully integrated matchmaking service, which we launched in 1996 with the release of Diablo. Battle.net evolved over the years to fully incorporate online gameplay for StarCraft, Diablo II, a re-release of Warcraft II, and Warcraft III. The Battle.net system has been in its current form, without major changes, since 2003. <br />
<br />
What is the Real ID feature? <br />
Real ID is at the forefront of online gaming as it will allow you to easily connect, communicate, and play with real-life friends. Connect with old friends and current guildies, and make new friends with the integrated Battle.net social networking tools. Beyond simply seeing your friend’s character names (e.g. “Gorlac” in World of Warcraft or “Snip3r” in StarCraft II), and having to remember which character name goes with which friend, you will be able to see your Real ID friend and chat with him or her across Blizzard games. What’s more, Real ID is totally optional -- the options are there for you to build your Blizzard Entertainment social network however you see fit. <br />
<br />
What are some of the communication tools available in the new Battle.net?<br />
Our vision is for the new Battle.net to become the ultimate Blizzard Entertainment social network, in addition to its matchmaking foundation. Simply logging in to Battle.net will make it easy to find and chat with your friends across World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, and future Blizzard Entertainment titles, including Diablo III. Keep track of all your buddies in your friends list, view their online status and presence information, voice chat, send out party invites, and broadcast messages to your friends. Detailed character profiles let players keep up to date on friends’ progress and achievements. <br />
<br />
Will classic Blizzard Entertainment games be supported on the new Battle.net?<br />
We do eventually plan to update all classic Battle.net games to take advantage of the new Battle.net accounts and server infrastructure. Beyond this, we do not have anything to announce today regarding legacy Blizzard Entertainment titles and the new Battle.net experience. <br />
<br />
Will a forced migration to Battle.net occur for World of Warcraft players?<br />
Yes, sometime in the near future, it will be necessary for all World of Warcraft subscribers to transition their accounts to the new Battle.net system. Those players who have already converted to the new system will be able to take part in the new Battle.net features soon. <br />
<br />
What will change in World of Warcraft after the forced migration?<br />
The core gameplay experience will remain unchanged as a result of the migration. However, you’ll be able to take part in all of the new Battle.net features, such as cross-realm, cross-faction, and cross-game chat. <br />
<br />
I cannot wait till this is released. This will be a great feature.</div></div><hr />

None of them are perfect from the perspectives of playability and intuitiveness, and all could use some improvement. From an aesthetic POV, each city has its own appeal and charm, but all of them have flaws once you start navigating.<br />
<br />
I'm sure other people had slightly to greatly different experiences as a newbie of a certain race, I thought I'd share my personal experiences. I'll try to remember how I felt about a few cities as a new player of that particular race, without any previous experience, as well as how long it took for me to get used to the layout. <br />
<br />
Orgrimmar - The Valley of Strength, The Drag, and the Cleft of Shadow were easy to navigate. The signs were placed in convenient places. The other sections had me confused, and the path leading to the Valley of Honor was hard for me to find due to the twisty route. The locations of the shops and miscellaneous buildings wasn't always a clear thing. It took me 10 minutes to find Thrall, and it felt like the arms/armor shops exploded everywhere.<br />
<br />
Undercity - I knew where almost everything was the first time I got there, just by glancing at the map. I only had to ask directions during my first few days there, especially to where the first aid trainer was. My main issue was screaming my head off at the SINGLE MAILBOX. <br />
<br />
Thunderbluff - Oh god. Couldn't a bunch of cows build their city closer to the GROUND? What is it about unearthly high pinnacles, rope bridges and tauren? This was the opposite experience of Org. Terrible central area design, excellent outlying areas.<br />
<br />
Silvermoon - Damn you Kael for putting up all those barriers with your stupid statue. After UC, I loved this place for its numerous mailboxes. Did I mention it's pretty? The aesthetic of a majestic elven city in a state of partial decay was very good.<br />
<br />
Stormwind - Good districts, but I hated the bridges. I was rather meh on the aesthetics... probably why I never rolled human.<br />
<br />
Ironforge - Never been there. Funny, no?<br />
<br />
Darnassus - Lovely place. But oddly, I got lost trying to find the bank without asking for directions. And while I know where all the trade shops are, finding the right one always has me mousing over the signs since I can never remember which building has what shop exactly.<br />
<br />
Exodar - This was an absolutely horrible experience for me. I had difficulty finding the entrance, let alone navigating. Of all the cities, this was the one where I could get lost unless I consulted the map constantly, and I would have to keep asking directions. Every building looked the same as every other. You can blame the fact that the Exodar is a single structure, so this is a case where aesthetic interferes with playability. I still get lost there.</div></div><hr />

It'd be nice if they relocated the zepps to inside orgrimmar. I mean you see 1 up there that just does nothing. It'd certainly make the city feel more lively with zepps flying in and out. Instead we have a ghetto tower OUTSIDE the city. :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Well if you look at the picture of the reinforced Orgrimmar it does appear to be a Zeppelin tower on the right.<br />
<br />
Indeed, another facet in a ****ed up design of Orgrimmar.<br />

Dont even get me started about UC only having 10 guards and one mail box --___--.... there's like 8 mail boxes in Stormwind now and 2 are like 20yrds from each other!<br />
<br />
<br />
Uhm, no, Orgrimmar is not sectioned off and shares a theme, everything is in Bum****, Idaho in relation to the theme, none of the themes sharing anything with their contents barring the center for Rogues and Warlocks.<br />
<br />
Undercity has everything clearly sectioned, easy to navigate, no winding tunnels or weird second levels of small huts, you just weren't paying attention, it's arguably as well designed as Ironforge.<br />
<br />
Look at a map sometime.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate it if they did convenience fixes on all the cities, not just Org. None of them are perfect from the perspectives of playability and intuitiveness, and all could use some improvement.

<br />
<br />
Thunder Bluff has the most simplistic design of all the cities, the centers are just a fire and a lake surrounded by huts facing inward, it's literally the easiest place to navigate.<br />
<br />
Not sure how someone could see it differently.<br />
<br />
Ironforge is a duplicate of UC, just much larger and with no second level/mount hating entrance.<br />
<br />
Exodar, I didn't find it confusing at all, I didn't like it because of how hard it was to reach, but once I learned what each &quot;district&quot; meant, it was easy to navigate.<br />
<br />
Part of Orgrimmar's design problem lies with the fact that the names often share little with their contents, it would be like going to a certain place called the Castro District and finding a GOP convention.<br />
<br />
It's bemusing, at least, as well as illogical.</div></div><hr />

I myself can tell you all the profession/AH/Mail Boxes/Battlemasters/Class Trainers of Undercity, Thunderbluff and Orgrimmar (Silvermoon I only know the Jewelcrafter trainer ...). You just need to get used to.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can get used to anything- people used to use computers by typing arcane strings of letters and numbers on a blank screen. Paralyzed people type with a pencil in their teeth. Just because you can get used to it, doesn't mean it's desirable. <br />
<br />
I'm Horde all the way, since Vanilla WoW- I still have Tier 1's in the bank. I know where everything is in Org, and I got used to it, but I still HATE Org. I have never understood why the Alliance cities are both way prettier, and way better laid out. At least we got SMC (decent) and they got Exodar (flippin TERRIBLE) in BC, but I still dream of going Alliance just for the better architecture. The first time I saw the Stormwind docks I almost cried. <br />

I counter with Exodar.<br />

The first and only thing I've memorized there is how to get out after portaling in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love Steam, as well as alot of the games created by Valve, but the only thing I ever really launch through steam is WoW. If this new Battle.net thing will indeed work like Steam, the only problem I'd have is getting everyone I know through Steam to transfer.</div></div><hr />

The fact of the matter is that the city planning of Orgrimmar has no system, and makes no real sense as opposed to both Stormwind and Ironforge.<br />
<br />
Ironforge:<br />
Circular district design. Crafting professions in the middle at and around the great forge, class trainers and relevant vendors have their districts, or wards, in the outer rings. Example: The warriors/hunters have their trainer in the Military Ward, where battlemasters and weapon/armor vendors also reside. This is also the location for the training dummies. Tinker town has the Tram, engineers and similar. The commons contain the everyday needs of the people through AH, Bank, Inn ++. And on it goes.<br />
<br />
Stormwind:<br />
Once again, district based layout. Here they have added a city river to separate the areas. Old town is the elder rebuilt part of stormwind, and it is here that the warriors ++ reside. The SI:7 and Army Keep thingy (can't remember, i play horde) + other war related vendors are in here, like weapon and armor vendors for most classes. Trade district is basically the same as The Commons in IF. Cathedral Square deals with holy classes, like priests and paladins and other humanitarian organizations, aswell as one weapon shop, basically selling paladin weapons so.<br />
<br />
Orgrimmar:<br />
No real design. Valley of Strength is basically a bunch of burrows placed randomly around in a ravine. Contains the AH and Bank. Dark people go into Cleft of Shadow (Rogue, Warlock), Spiritual/holy people in the Valley of Wisdom(Shaman/Paladin), Holy/Arcane got their own little hut on the way out the backdoor.(Priest, Mage), Valley of Honor got the rest(Warrior, Hunter.) VoH also contains a lake with a fisher, engineers, and ofc the usual people affilated with warriors. If you look at the layout, you can obviously seen that they just found a big ravine and started raising buildings where they saw fit. The actual road system is poorly planned. House placement is completely random. Alot of vendors and profession trainers seem randomly placed.<br />
<br />
My point is that even though you get used to it and might find out that you are more familiar in Org than in IF and SW (Which is up to the every single person). The design of SW and IF far surpasses Org, regardless of what any person says anywhere.<br />
