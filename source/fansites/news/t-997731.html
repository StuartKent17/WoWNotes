Can't be that famous if I've never heard of it. :p<br />

<br />
Because it could be read a couple of different ways, it could just be a rewording, or it could be that it just grants you a bonus to crit equal to what you already have.<br />
<br />
I'm personally more interested in the unholy changes, I could really care less about frost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just curious how do you figure frost dks are getting nerfed by changing the wording to 100% crit instead of guaranteed crit :P?<br />
Granted, it is datamined information, but I know Blizzard has been eyeing Frost DK for at least awhile now. The reason I figure it as a nerf is because the new wording talks about &quot;100% critical bonus&quot;, implying that you'll hit even harder when a critical attack occurs but no longer are guaranteed that actual critical attack itself.<br />
<br />
Hope that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

He speaks the truth. I've never heard of the Jenny-song either, and I believe that's due to the fact that the song never was a big hit in Europe (at least not in Finland). I mean, there's not even a Wikipedia page of the band in too many languages, let alone the song. And in Wikipedia we trust!</div></div><hr />

well the thing is, they were 77 on the ptr, and this indicates that they are being changed BACK to 67, as they are on live, which will mean that JC is not going to be as good as other professions</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you play with bad Frost DKs, or Frost DKs that get horrible RNG, because both specs played optimally frost will be higher dps. I mean my OS is unholy and I do really good dps with it, but that's just cause I prefer unholy's playstyle, Frost is waayyyyy too boring.</div></div><hr />

Yea, it's a huge nerf. But since they released the t13 ele bonuses, I was wondering how they'd make it worth dropping the t12 2 piece... I guess that's our answer: they're not going to make t13 better, they're just going to nerf t12 into the ground so the stats on t13 look worth it.</div></div><hr />

Have you ever played an Arcane Mage? Takes boring to a whole new level.<br />
<br />
BM is the most boring rotation of the 3 Hunter specs, but it's also one of the most unique and interesting specs in the game as a whole. You have no idea how much it would mean to me if I could use my giant green Devilsaur in raids again. He's been stabled far too long.</div></div><hr />

lol -- You can't be nerfed with what you don't have. The Tier 13 bonus got adjusted. How exactly is that a nerf when you can't even get it? Better for them to adjust it now when it doesn't affect us than for it to go live and nerf it.</div></div><hr />

You will see there will be more changes made before it will go live. God forbid they may even revert this PTR change!<br />

That's NOT a tooltip clarification to shaman t12. That's a pretty gigantic nerf.5.0 patchnotes: [insert random ele talent] now removes the cooldown for fire elemental totem<br />

(Can't post link, remove spaces: db. mmo-champion. com/ i/ 77954/ vial-of-black-dragonsblood )<br />
Should be a part of the creation of the legendary daggers with the Elementium Gem Cluster and the Shadow Gem. But for which stage ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogue AOE damage were already good spamming FoK (as Assassination, Combat have BF).<br />
Good it's buff again. Probably there will be encounters that requires high AOE damages.</div></div><hr />

Illidan got his Sargeras powers after he had been twisted by Xavius to my memory; he's currently fighting with Tyrande against the Legion, when at this point he should have been 'siding'(loosely, since he did kinda want to stop them but was darkened by Xavius) the Legion. Keep in mind it's been awhile since I've played WC3 and I might have gotten some order wrong, but I'm pretty sure having Illidan fight alongside Tyrande vs. Legion POST Sargeras powers is a change. The other thing that tips me off that there are changes is some of the datamined dialogue that was in an earlier news post. Wouldn't surprise me if this is a retcon; they've said more than once if something will add to gameplay somehow they'll retcon it.</div></div><hr />
