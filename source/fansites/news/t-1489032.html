Blizzard posted clarifications on how Challenge mode rewards will play out at the end of the season.<br />
Countless adventurers continue to brave the most trying versions of Mists of Pandaria dungeons, but the clock is ticking. This “season” of Challenge Modes will be coming to an end with the upcoming release of a patch prior to the expansion’s release.<br />
<br />
Challenge Modes are designed to offer as close to a “normalized” difficulty as possible, and they’re tuned to be tough to master. With Warlords of Draenor’s class changes, itemization changes (e.g. the removal of Hit and Expertise), and—of course—increased level cap on the horizon, the difficulty of Mists of Pandaria’s dungeons will no longer be tuned the same as they were. In the spirit of fair play, when the aforementioned patch is released a little while before the new expansion launches, the current slate of Challenge Mode dungeons will no longer be available, and the achievements they award will be converted to Feats of Strength. The reward items will still be available for purchase by those who qualified prior to the end of the season, but it will not be possible for new players to earn those rewards going forward.<br />
<br />
If you still need to earn your Undaunted title, Ancestral Phoenix, or class-specific Transmogrification sets, now’s the time to get out there and prove your worth. In Warlords of Draenor, an entirely new set of Challenge Modes will be available . . . and with them an array of new rewards for you to earn. Until then, stay sharp!<br />
<br />
* Reward Clarifications<br />
<br />
With the upcoming end of the Challenge Mode Season, we wanted to provide some additional clarification on how we plan to handle rewards.<br />
<br />
Achievements: All Achievements associated with Mists of Pandaria Challenge Modes will become Feats of Strength.<br />
<br />
Rewards<br />
<br />
Bronze: The “Undaunted” title for achieving a full set of Bronze medals will become account-wide.<br />
Silver: The Pandaren Phoenix mounts awarded for a full set of Silver medals will become account-wide. If any character on an account has earned a full set of Silver medals, all four variants of the Pandaren Phoenix (Crimson, Ashen, Violet, and Emerald) will become available to all characters account-wide.<br />
Gold: The cosmetic class sets will remain character-specific. Any character that has earned all nine Gold medals will still be able to repurchase the appropriate set, should they misplace theirs, from Challenger Soong or Challenger Wuli in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Any characters that have earned one or more “Challenger’s Path” teleport spells by earning Gold medals in Mists Challenge Modes will retain those spells.<br />
Realm Best Titles: There are extremely limited titles that are held by the players who hold the best clear time for a given dungeon on a given server. Since those Challenge dungeons will no longer be available in Warlords of Draenor, their respective titles are also being permanently removed. There will be new Challenge dungeons in the upcoming Warlords season, and new titles for which to contend, however.</div></div><hr />

It's already account wide LOL. They worded this entire post so poorly. Do I only need 1 toon with silver to get<br />
all 4 mounts or do I have to do it on 4 seperate toons. Beyond that, taking away the titles from the players is<br />
just ridiculous BUT because of how they've worded it it's hard to tell if they mean the titles are gone on a whole<br />
or if just the ability to get it is gone. 2/10 blizz, come on.</div></div><hr />

^ This seems to make the most sense. Hopefully they reconsider; it would be a pretty good idea to keep them in so people can have fun things to still accomplish while we wait around aimlessly.</div></div><hr />

Warcraft rather get rid of and let huge amounts of content rot rather than keep it in play. Old zones are pointless, old dungeons etc... Warcraft needs a level mentoring system where you can mentor to the appropriate level and still have access to all these things and still have meaning, the rewards, and so forth. <br />
<br />
I wish they had story lines that progressed throughout the expansion that took us to places not just the new zones. Mists was a huge missed opportunity for this. There should have been war bands for both factions on all continents attacking the settlements there. However Blizzard doesn't want to disrupt peoples game play, look at the whine from the zombie WotLK launch. There is another underlying problem in that Blizzard permanently locks content into this timed story line that becomes irrelevant once the next expansion hits. Instead the zones story should be something for those that level and each patch and expansion should bring elements of a overall story for the expansion and progress it allowing stuff to be done all over the world and on different continents. A decent example of this comes with how Rift does their quests now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having all the realm best titles on my realm this is very disappointing to say the least. I thought we would keep the titles and maybe make for some interesting back and forth between the top guilds to make sure we keep them. What a let down.<br />

Gladiator, Duelist, Rival and Challenger get removed. Rank 1 doesn't, because it's earned (not to say the others aren't), just like rank 1 CM. Stupid decision.</div></div><hr />

Well, they are not. Everything else you wrote after is just noise. Wow is still by far the best MMO on the market.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't a &quot;WoW is &lt; / &gt; / = to x&quot; subject, so, lets keep on topic.<br />
<br />
The removal of the titles is nothing short of dsiappointing and rather counter-intuitive. Now there is practically no incentive to try and keep the titles if they're just going to be removed. I quite looked forward to seeing the intense competition to see who keeps them. Why keep everything else and not the titles?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moradim</div><div class="date">2014-04-02, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">also, whats the point of removing the titles anyway?<br />
<br />
&quot;cause the challenge modes are going away&quot;<br />
<br />
so what? you cant get grand crusader now either. or hand of a'dal, and so on. gives them more prestige if its something you cant get anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Staying on a dead server was never doing to work. Dead servers are being merged virtually, and challenge mode titles go to the highest time on the combined server. So you'd have lost it immediately anyway when your dead server was combined with another <br />
<br />
I don't have any of the titles anymore, and I still don't like them removing the titles. Even if there are new titles, these particular ones are going away permanently, and some of them are very cool.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">majesta</div><div class="date">2014-04-02, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, they are not. Everything else you wrote after is just noise. Wow is still by far the best MMO on the market.<br />
<br />
Define best? It is subjective. I feel other MMOs are starting to beat Warcraft as Warcraft isn't the new innovative kid on the block. They are the big beast now that everyone else is trying to figure out how to take down and they are doing it. A death by a thousand cuts.<br />
<br />
Let us look at Warcraft from a slightly different angle.<br />
<br />
A lot of people have recently be clamoring about how Warcraft has been stumbling the past few years. We exited Cataclysm what is being hailed as the worst expansion and is very consistent in polling about this, and jumped into Mists. Mists was a promising expansion, however it met great resistance and turned many away right away. The quality of Mists doesn't matter when 5 million subscriptions are lost over a 3 year period.<br />
<br />
Now we have Warlords of Draenor to look forward. From my initial reaction is it appears to be a universe pseudo reboot to attract the older player base back. This is their &quot;OMG we must save our cash cow&quot; reaction to bring Warcraft back, but is it really back?<br />
<br />
I am not saying Warcraft is toast, I just feel the game is going to continue to drop subscriptions over time. There probably will even be a sub bounce at Warlords launch. But I feel Warcraft has already hit its pinnacle and now we are watching the decline. At the time of Warcraft's initial launch in 2004 and 2005 they revolutionized MMOs. They shook MMOs to their core foundation, challenged and changed so much. At the time gaming was for a much more hardcore group of people. The concept of casual gaming didn't really exist. Warcraft brought a lot of quality of life changes to the gaming genre and many other newer games over the years began to borrow and use these ideas. <br />
<br />
This all lead to Warcraft becoming hugely popular and a household name. The novelty of Warcraft has now been absorbed into the industry. The shimmering awesomeness is wearing or has wore off. Nothing stays new and shinny forever. Blizzard is no longer the new trendy kid, even if quality hasn't changed, they are no longer setting the pace of the industry. Warcraft is now in a spot where they are the default MMO in the industry, they are the establishment.<br />
<br />
Games are now being designed not to copy Warcraft, but to address the specific issues of Warcraft's design while copying what has been done that works. What was once a small niche subculture thing has now became mainstream and a part of culture. Almost everyone has some experience with the game or knowledge of it and has formed opinions about the game. With that comes some people feeling the game is old and tired. Even if they like the artistic style or the story or some other thing. Others are just tired of lipstick on a pig. Some feel Blizzard is slow to release content. Others feel the quality of play has slide and some even feel Blizzard cares about money more now than ever. All of these lead to people turning away.<br />
<br />
No there isn't just that one thing that drives people away as a whole. It is always that straw that breaks the camels back. Sometimes it is something as petty as a very small glitch or bug, but it was the accumulation of problems that turned the individual away. With other MMOs offering different flavors of ice cream with updated engines and graphic systems it is so easy for Warcraft to be in a state of decline, even if that decline takes a decade from now.</div></div><hr />

So let everyone with the FoS keep the titles of the ones they have... I really don't see a problem with that.</div></div><hr />

So basically, if you have done the Challenge Modes on only 1 character (and only got 1 phoenix), you get an extra 3 mounts as soon as the rewards are removed?</div></div><hr />

My server is (beyond) dead and has yet to be slated for a realm merge that we know of. Some people from a high pop server transferred to it to specifically take advantage of being able to get and hold the titles, ostensibly until they were made permanent. Joke's on them, I guess, lol.</div></div><hr />

Our group worked our butts off to beat all the realm best times and make them very hard to beat again by anyone else. Dedicated many 3-4 hour nights twice a week to make sure we kept the titles. Now I have no desire to do them at all. Horrible idea, I'm sure many groups that had plans to keep pushing for realm bests will just stop now too. Way to take away the incentive to compete...<br />

That is indeed what it sounds like. While a bit of an odd turn, it's not completely nonsensical (and also only revealed when it's confirmed they go account-wide) given the relative lack of difficulty of the silver ones -- if you got silver on one character, it's very difficult to imagine you couldn't do it three more times, making this more of a time saver than anything else.</div></div><hr />

The titles have been out since 5.4, there has been plenty of time for people to work and beat times that hold the current titles. I currently hold 9/9 realm best titles on 2 realms, 1 realm has 2 other teams and the other realm has one other team to compete against, however, as I previously mentioned, we put down so much time and money on this that we completely annihilated the competition we had (on the realm with 2 competing teams) that they haven't even gotten close to beat our new times, which include a lot of top 10-20 world timers, and on the other realm we haven't really try-harded that much, we got the titles, they beat our times after 4-5 months, we went back in and got them all back in 2 days.<br />
<br />
So it doesn't really make sense in removing these titles. These are the rank 1 gladiator titles of PvE this expansion really. I mean, every other FoS title still excists on those accounts (death's demise, grand crusader, conqueror of naxxramas, etc).<br />

You are way exaggerating what it takes to get these titles, if you fought on your current realm and your current realm had some of the best in the world then you were fighting for times not titles, there are tons of realms out there where with a non-optimal comp and barely any effort in gear will get you the achievements and titles. Grats you have your title now enjoy it but obviously if the titles were all you were going for there were way better ways to go about it, spending 3 months of your life doing this was your decision to aim for the times on that specific realm.<br />

<br />
Hey guys!<br />
Since I am a CM geek, I've read this topic, and just wanted to share a few words as a person which is actually fighting for those titles.<br />
<br />
For once, my group have managed to acquire them at the very begining, and after few months we lost them. No biggie, we can always get them back. And we were about to, just talking with people and setting up for a few (dozen?) runs to retake them. Times on our server aren't that tough, so why not. Some of those people have only stayed in MoP for so long, after clearing 14/14hc, just to enjoy that competition of running against other groups, to see who - in the end - will be best and aquires those titles. Sounds like fun to me, even if only for those elite groups, but hey - its not like people are complaining that Garrosh hc is too elite, right?<br />
<br />
Now, some of you are trying to tell me, that it is just vile for a few reasons.<br />
<br />
1. Another group can beat you in all on the very last day, and get them from you. Well, yea, I guess thats what competition is all about. If you are not carefull, same thing can happen in arena brackets with your glad title. Last day you can just get bounced from top, and you end with nothing. Thats is why those groups are sitting now in CMs, getting best times they can think of - and if someone beats them - its only fair to approve their superiority. After announcement, that titles are being removed - carrot is gone, so who would want to just improve? Got FoSes, im done. And, which is important as well, if times are decent, it is impossible to retake them all in 1 day (or even a week) without a long practise period. Current world record in SH is 2:58, on good servers around 3:30-3:40. Good luck one shotting that.<br />
<br />
2. CMs r1 would be sold around for titles - Well, boo freakin' hoo, so what? Wake up, every day dozens of players are getting boosted through CM golds, 14/14hcs, arenas and so on. If server is any good, then it is not possible to get those FoSes with a customer. You can trust this guy - I have over 600 CMs completed on my priest only. On the other hand - boosting someone on some dead realm? Fine, why not, if any 'native' 5 man group will gather to do them, its theirs. Not even 1 trully boosting group will be able to maintain those r1 with a customer, in case any other group wants to get them. Becouse after they get beaten, they would have to get back there. And again. And again. Up to a point where you are just not able to do it with a customer - unless you practise with him a lot - but I've never heard of such a long-term boosting agreement :P<br />
<br />
3. Those titles can only be aquired only by certain classes - ok, thats true in most cases - so how does it work, when each season in a PvP ladder one setup is just taking it all - and noone is complaining on a similiar level? If you really want those titles (which are character specific btw), you can just roll an alt. It all depends on your commitment. Besides, I've seen some seriously strange setups on various servers, that just blew my mind - and their times were actually good. Like I said - its all about how serious you are about your efforts and how imaginative you can be - to come up with new tactics which will let you be that few seconds faster each try.<br />
<br />
And Im happy to answer to more. In my opinion this decision from Blizz only took a huge piece of fun lots of people could have while fighting over those titles, myself included. Ah well, maybe they will change their mind in a few days - after all that CM blog looks just so poorly written..<br />
<br />

We all wanted the realm best FoS &amp; titles on the realm we play on, and the times we had to beat (some of them) where very high ranked, so we ended up going for realm best titles AND world rankings at the same time, and dno if you knew it, but if you transfer from the realm with the title you lose the title.</div></div><hr />

You're kidding right? Stuff never gets removed, it's about time to change some things like blizzard used to do in the past. So what if one title, 4 mounts and 9 sets of transmog gear never get back into the game. The wotlk pre event gear sets are gone too and I see nobody complaining about it or the black scarab/proto drake. Time to move on.<br />
Also it is nice of blizzard to let us know in advance before removing stuff instead of just removing it silently.</div></div><hr />

Have you ever considered that &quot;we&quot;, those who do care about prestigious stuff, also don't care about what &quot;you&quot; think?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowfyre27</div><div class="date">2014-04-03, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see them removing the titles as a good thing. In order to get the absolute best times for the titles if you play on a server with good people competing then you had to run very specific comps. Blizzard has stated in the past that they want bring the player not the class. These absolute best times require you to tell people no because of the class they play. You are FORCED to play specific classes to achieve the best times on the top realms. CM's were designed so that every class and spec could achieve a gold medal but not the best times. Blizzard even stated that in order to achieve the best times that certain classes and specs would NOT be viable. So how would it be far to let someone who wants the title on a char but that character isn't viable? It's not and therefore the best solution is to remove the titles. To me there's an awful lot of people who seem to think it's ok to penalize people for not playing a specific class or spec or for not transferring to a dead realm where they could cheese their way to obtaining them. That is sad and pathetic imo. Accept that you can get new titles in the next expac with the new CM's, so move on and stop crying over something that was never going be permanent.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirque</div><div class="date">2014-04-03, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, I'd like to add that you can read the stuff about the mounts two ways.<br />
<br />
One way obviously is that if you did silver CMs, all four mounts become instantly available to you on your account. Seems unlikely at best and kind of stupid IMO.<br />
<br />
The way I read it is that the mount(s) you have, no matter which, will become account wide.</div></div><hr />

Elseway we will see a behaviour like with the opening of Ahn Quiraij...people will transfer to smaller realms just in time to get the titles forever. Most of the people that are now afraid of losing their titles would lose them anyway that way and then come here crying too. So for Blizz it's a lose/lose situation and they make the better choice for the community/game(although they could earn more on the short run by just letting people transfer for titles).</div></div><hr />

People love to inflate what other ppl think about &quot;Prestige&quot; they've earned. Most of the time when people do something that separates themselves they aren't wanting recognition. They want it for personal satisfaction. Nobody expects anyone to do anything other than go about their lives.<br />

But I would rather see anyone who has ever held a realm best time (i.e has the FOS) get the title, and see that number increase by 10000% than I would see those 5 people per realm lose their title. <br />
<br />
If you have the title now you've earnt it. You should keep it. @Blizzard and their 'the first team gets it title, 4 weeks later team 3 beat team1 by 4 minutes, but dont get title because team2 is already faster' what a load of total rubbish. If team3 didn't beat team2 they didnt beat anything did they. - They're both probably using team1s strat, which in my eyes means team1 deserve the title for being best first; team 2 deserve the title for being better 2nd, and team 3 need to stfu and actually achieve something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ultimately, reading between the lines in Watcher's post, I conclude that they just see way too many negatives and unhealthy outcomes to making these titles permanent - whichever way they decide to go:<br />
<br />
Option 1: Give the last man standing the title:<br />
<br />
If they decide to let the last team to have it when the patch lands keep it will result in some insanely competitive play. You can already see some posts by some people who have put crazy amounts of effort into getting their top spot, but when 2 or more teams are competing at that level it just becomes insane. Just as good, healthy competition is great for the game, unhealthy competition can be very damaging. Can you imagine the insanity in the week before the patch lands? And what about the people who lose out? If someone compromises their health from staying up for 72 hours straight while trying to keep or beat the best time right at the end, is it really worth it? If someone in such a condition suffers a mental breakdown, attempts (or succeeds) at committing suicide because they missed the title, is it really worth it?<br />
<br />
I guess a lot of people won't have thought about those kind of ramifications, but I believe a lot of bad will come from it if they try this.<br />
<br />
Option 2: Give everyone who got it the title:<br />
<br />
The problem here becomes people who start gaming this in future expansions, or even at the end of MoP. You'll have people switching realms to find a spot to get it. At the start of an expansion you'll have a bunch of people racing for the first clear. And then, once people have achieved a realm lead, they'll quit it altogether because they know they have what they need and CMs will then die horribly. The whole motivation behind those titles will be forever lost - it will become like so many achievements, a box to tick rather than a title to defend.<br />
<br />
Again, all sorts of unhealthy competition that sucks the fun right out of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I hear you guys that it sucks for those who feel they deserve the permanent title. But in the grand scheme of things, I think the devs have a good point and even if we can't know for certain that the nett outcome will be bad, the risk simply isn't worth it...</div></div><hr />

I'm big on achievements and was saddened that all my cm points would be converted to FoS thus lowering my point total when Im so close to 20k points. That said, I'm not all up in arms nerd raging about it. Oh fucking well. People complaining about the time they spent on getting best times is just plain silly. More than likely, you've already spent a large amount of time on this game so why ask for all those &quot;wasted&quot; hours of your life back. Did you have fun competing for best times? If so, there is you're fucking reward. In truth, I think the first group of players to beat each CM (gold version) should be the ones that keep the title just like the guild that beats a heroic boss first. The race should of ended there.</div></div><hr />

I've done gold on my druid on a very busy server but again good luck managing to form a group on normal or low servers unless you have guild mates interested.

It's pointless information.<br />
I understand that it takes time out of your day to keep your titles, but it's just a TITLE. It's one thing if Blizzard just straight up took away the mounts and transmog gear along with the titles, but they aren't. Honestly there are several other things that could be deemed more important to complain until the sun goes down. <br />
<br />
I am glad though that they are making the mounts account wide. I would really love to ride them on my alts. Now if I understand correctly, we don't have to do CM on alts to get the other mounts. But will Blizzard automatically give them to us or will we have to pay for them? (Like the Netherwing Drakes)</div></div><hr />

Just do what I am doing - enjoy the titles while you have them, think back on fond memories of tackling a challenge with friends (you did them with friends and not a bunch of assholes you can't stand who you were just using for times, right?), show them off in Shrine while you play ESO on another screen, etc.<br />
<br />
If you are upset about losing them you shouldn't have been farming them in the first place.</div></div><hr />

The titles were twice over stated by Blizzard officials to most likely be permanent come WoD. With no updates on that, that's the assumption we were working under. They can't claim for them to be permanent one day, and gone the next without people being upset. <br />
<br />
The fact is, some of the people out there put in so much work just to make sure we never lost them. If we did lose them to other players, then they earned them better than we did. They worked harder than we did; because none of the people in that thread would lose them to someone on an accidental run.<br />
<br />
I'd be perfectly fine to lose them to a competitor, and I'd show that person respect as someone who also put in huge amounts of time and work into taking that title. If someone sweeped my titles tomorrow, I'd still champion to have them kept in game. Because they don't deserve to lose them any more than the rest of us.<br />
<br />
As for fond memories, yes, I'll remember 3am resets on Shado-pan because the stupid novices bugged out AGAIN. And the thousands of gold my team dropped switching to engineering. And the thousands of herbs I farmed specifically for those runs. And the daily checking of the leaderboard. And the dozens of videos I watched 10 times over just to see what buffs they had and where. The cumulative hundred runs on megaera to get our cloth wearers their bracers with a favorable roll. Those are the things I'll remember, and all we'll have left is a feat of strength among many feats of strength for CMs. <br />
<br />
All of that said, I still encourage EVERYONE with strong feelings to weigh in on the official forums. Both good and bad.<br />

Sounds to me like u never even enjoyed doing CMs and that it was more like a chore. U know, ppl went for realm best and world best times long before those titles were even introduced. What incentive do u think they had? Maybe they actually enjoyed it? Just like many guilds enjoy doing speedruns in SoO with nothing to show for it than WoWprogress rankings.</div></div><hr />

With that mentality, all titles should be taken away whenever new content or a patch comes out. While we're at it why not just delete our characters whenever a new expansion comes out and force us to re-roll.<br />

This guy is hilarious. New Expansion always comes with certain things being removed welcome to World of Warcraft. The new expansion means new challenges to conqueor. Who needs some stupid title to show it off, it's just like the joke with Loremaster when they nerfed the hell out of that achieve in Cataclysm. Made it three hundred times easier for everyone to get it, but everyone who had it when it was an actual challenge just got the shaft and didn't even get a FOS saying oh you did this before we nerfed the crap out of questing. Didn't say anything, be glad you getting an FOS, I honestly don't even think ya deserve that. New expansion comes out, cool DE all my gear and let's star tit all over again. Part of the experience as a character, you conquer everything in SoO and now its time to conquer WoD and you start from nothing again.</div></div><hr />

Of course you can. Realm firsts more so, going from the devs twitter response to the rank 1 comparison. It was a title earned with current content, that was kept forever. This is a title earned with current content being removed in the next patch.</div></div><hr />

You are wrong. The purpose of the game shouldn't be to force people in some format like joining such guilds that have people who go to challenges. Why is there random dungeon finder tool? To let people play. Is there any particular reason for not let people play challenges unless they do it with their guild? No other than some Blizzard strategy of driving people into guilds. But guess what? They failed to keep me interested in their game instead!</div></div><hr />

I just learned that all my hc warforged BiS gear will become next to worthless in WoD, and that even some green quest gear will be better! So to be able to sit in Shrine and impress noobs I have to kill even MORE hard bosses to get a new set of gear. This is ridiculous. I suggest that all of us who have gathered our sexy gear from SoO hc rally together and try to convince blizzard that they should let our gear be BiS in WoD as well!! Who's with me!?<br />

The logic in this quote... there is none. What you wrote doesn't make any sense at all and is in no way comparable to the removing of the CM titles. <br />
<br />
I don't get what do people, who do not compete for the said titles, have against keeping them in the game. If you are not in the &quot;race&quot;, why do you want them removed? Why not let people, who actually are involved in the competition for them, have it their way?</div></div><hr />

Except Glad. titles are gained at the end of the season and the raid titles could be obtained by everyone. People who hold the current fastest time in CM's have the title for as long as they are the fastest. Since there is no way of defeating them after patch 6.0 its clearly different to other titles.<br />
<br />
And to people who are saying we want them removed, that is truly not the case. We just agree with the PoV of Blizz, if they want to keep it near the end anyway they are free to go. <br />
<br />
<br />
For people who want a title that compares to this: The Battle of Ahn'Qiraj (Scarab Lord), they did not removed this and the person who got to open the gates first kept it trough all the patches/expacs.</div></div><hr />

Immortal was done via raiding/achievements which could of been made much easier. Hand of A'dal is different due to it's raiding. CM's aren't. Realm Firsts are a completely different since it's a race to X Level that and the way people went was unhealthy(Staying up all night). Don't need to do that to CM's Gladiator titles are much harder to obtain IMO since the top what .2A% or something and Cm's...well....not even %'s are used.</div></div><hr />
