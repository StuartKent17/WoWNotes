<br />
Not so sure about that, it's perfectly possible they could be present at the end of the expansion. We know Gul'dan and his clan are serving them, and I expect Mannoroth and Kil'jaeden will not be pleased about the rest of the Iron Horde not serving them.</div></div><hr />

apparently you havent. <br />

gul'dan and all his followers still drank the demon blood and are loyal to the legion. which means the burning legion is ON the planet. <br />

Every expansion has been the &quot;real&quot; game... the absence of demons or scourge or whatever the fuck you people think is &quot;real&quot; warcraft stuff doesn't stop anything else being &quot;real&quot; lore.<br />
<br />
It took you a week to get out of Mulgore? Really?<br />
<br />
Raiders wanted questing to be faster so they could level the toons they needed to raid with ASAP. Blizzard just went along with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
garrosh convincing the orcs to fight back and kick gul'dan and his followers out probably slowed down their progress. <br />
<br />
demons cant just come in full force onto a planet without being summoned in, otherwise azeroth would be roasted by now. <br />
<br />
its also possible hes having gul'dan bide his time. the orcs are still going to war against the draenei. <br />
<br />
why fight a three way, and once we get there 4 way war when you can have both your enemies knock eachother out then come in and take down the scraps/salvage whatevers left</div></div><hr />

maybe not at the start but gul'dan is connectet to them my guess is when we fight back the horde he backstabing all (us and the iron horde) with a (sorta) invasion of the burning legion.</div></div><hr />

This so much.<br />
<br />
It's also all about perception, back then the world was new and fresh and everything was huge. Running around back then was an adventure, now you're just annoyed that you don't have your mount yet at lower levels. <br />
I remember being amazed that this huge area was only the starter zone, a tiny speck in a zone which was but a small part of the world in itself.</div></div><hr />

Gul'dan is confirmed working with Kil'Jaeden, which if you didn't know is the leader of the Burnign Legion (in Sargeras being gone for the moment at least).<br />
<br />
Then there's <br />
Talador: In the shadow of a besieged Shattrath City, the Auchenai Soulpriests actively seek to safeguard the countless draenei souls inside Auchindoun from a terrible demonic threat.<br />
http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/11512864<br />
<br />
Demons won't be in WoD as prominent as BC, but to say there won't be any is not knowing what you're talking about.</div></div><hr />

Unless Blizz is going to retcon the lore it means that demons are indeed on Draenor right now. However they've had to change some of it apparently. When they drink the blood it's in the Karabor (Black) temple as this is where they summon Mannoroth who gives them his blood. Well we know in WoD Karabor is still in the hands of the Draenei. However since they said Gul'dan has indeed drunk the &quot;cool aid&quot; meaning Blood, it would appear that they summoned him somewhere else. So Mannoroth would indeed have to be on Draenor or he came and left which wouldn't make much sense either.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a hardware problem, not a software one. Check what's in the computer chair and get rid of it, it's obviously malfunctioning. <br />
<br />
Now excuse me. I've got to go complain to Ford because my '69 Impala still has pedals, still runs on gas, and still travels over the ground. By now I should be able to get an upgrade kit to make it fly and travel time like Delorean did with their cars.<br />

I might be new to it since I didn't keep much track of MoP before I got my beta key, but I can't remember seeing excitement about some Alpha when we were waiting for Cataclysm or MoP.<br />

I hope this won't be the final music for the Login Screen... those drums become very annoying after some time....<br />
<br />
How long do you usually sit at the login screen before actually logging in...? :p</div></div><hr />

MoP didn't even had a F&amp;F Alpha. It's just a name, all that matter if there is NDA or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why are you even keeping track and/or still playing then? Your complaining is like complaining that houses still have walls after so many centuries of us using them, or dogs having four legs after so many centuries of selective breeding. WoW won't change the way it is played and what constitutes as gameplay, YOU will have to move on and do something else if it doesn't appeal to you. There are more than enough people out there still enjoying it simply because it is what it is and the way it is. I have been playing 6 years and I hope I can still enjoy it as I do now in 1 year or 5. <br />
<br />
Maybe it's easier to some (like me) to stay entertained because we are able to enjoy more than just endgame raiding, which seems to be the only thing you've been able to partake in. If a bike doesn't stay up when YOU are sitting on it, but runs smoothly when someone else uses it, the problem is probably not with the bike, as sad as that may feel. <br />

That explains why I can't remember any excitement over one then :p. I'd still like to know if anyone can give a theory on how long Alpha will be out before we get Beta</div></div><hr />

The alpha began quite awhile ago. This is about the alpha client being released without an NDA. It means we get datamined information instead of being limited to only what information Blizz trickles out through blog posts and interviews (and leaks that get taken down in days and are often faked). <br />
Also, the Alpha client being released usually means the beginning of the closed beta phases are very, very close to beginning.</div></div><hr />

...well then, I do declare: EEK! That explains why I see excitement about it both outside and in-game ^^. Thank you for that spot of info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
see gul'dan there? dudes still green as the hulk while the rest of them arent. <br />
<br />
and yes please go on about how i shouldve expected fucking time travel when we have a legendary questline shoved in our faces that says &quot;the legion are coming&quot; <br />
<br />
yeah i was totally dumb for thinking the legion was coming when wrathion told us the legion was coming. <br />
<br />
and technically the legion is coming. since gul'dan is part of the legion, so, im still right</div></div><hr />

I rarely put any weight behind these things, but I have to say that even I had a feeling ever since the Legendary Quest and WoD announcement that this is a buildup for The Legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Don't need to be looking the login screen for long to be annoyed by it... I remember the dragon scream at WotLK...<br />
These drums run through the entire piece of music, meaning that each time you logout to switch characters, each time you have a connexion problem, waiting for the game to connect, each time you wait on the loading screen, you might have these drums running all along... If it's becoming annoying now while only listening to the track once or twice, it will be much more annoying when we'll have it in the game every day...</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a heirloom book you can buy that teaches flying on Draenor for your alts.<br />
<br />
I am a bit disappointed, I was realy hoping they would make flying an ´old content´ thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't use the book then? Its always your own choice to fly or not, no need to have people forced into not flying just for your amusement.<br />
<br />
Let hope this means that blizzard understands that removing the option to fly in new content for too long isnt a smart thing to do (its a lose-lose situation for everyone)</div></div><hr />
