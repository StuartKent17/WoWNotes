Cataclysm - Archaeology<br />
Today is a small recap of Cataclysm professions features! <br />
Archaeology is the new secondary profession that will be joining the ranks of cooking, fishing, and first aid in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Archaeology allows the player to unlock new abilities and rewards by discovering ancient treasures throughout the world. Each archaeologist uses the profession to uncover clues hidden in the world around them, such as troll relics or map fragments, and decipher their meaning, enabling the clever archaeologist to manipulate pieces of the past, learning the location of a treasure cache or valuable artifact. Such artifacts are highly sought after by the Archaeology Society, and they pay in gold and items for their return. Those who have mastered archaeology can find Titan artifacts, earning special currency used to unlock character paths and allowing the player to further customize their character.<br />
<br />
Archaeology provides the Ancient Glyphs used by the Path of the Titans (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/path-of-the-titans-rankwatch-blue-posts/) and looks like a mix of tradeskills, gathering professions, and quests. Any character will be able to train it and people with an existing gathering profession will have the possibility to track both things at the same time. <br />
<br />
The artifacts you find are placed in your Archaeology journal, allowing you to study it to unlock rewards. According to the screenshot of the interface you will have to complete mini-quest to eventually get a reward. (In this case, the Black Market value of the axe is 30G)<br />
<br />
The most interesting aspect of the profession remains the Ancient Glyphs and it seems that all characters will have to train it if they want to access all the new skills. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Cataclysm - Reforging<br />
Reforging is an interesting addition to the existing tradeskills: Blacksmith / Leatherworker / Tailor / Jewelcrafter / Engineer. Each profession will have the possibility to modify your items to slightly modify their stats and replace them with new ones. Each profession get to reforge a type of items: cloth armor for tailors, leather for Leatherworkers, etc ...<br />
<br />
For example, a Blacksmith should be able to reforge your staff to reduce the Spirit bonus to add Intellect instead (= more spell power in Cataclysm, see the stats changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/cataclysm-stats-changes-masteries-terrain-phasing/)). Of course restrictions will apply and you can't create a +500 intellect breastplate just by removing all the other stats, the goal of this profession is to make items potentially interesting for more classes and reduce the amount of disenchanted items. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Cataclysm - New Water Engine<br />
Cataclysm will improve the graphic engine of World of Warcraft once again and add a handful of new effects. The most noticeable change is the new water engine and with the Cataclysm flooding a lot of zones of Azeroth, you will probably have a lot of occasions to experience it. Below are a few screenshots if you missed them. <br />

Addon Review - NPCScan<br />
NPCScan (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/npcscan.aspx) is one of the add-on that will make you feel guilty when you start using it (think of the first day you started using Quick Auctions (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info12196-QuickAuctions2.html))<br />
<br />
This addon tracks all the rare monsters in the game and replace the old macros and random tricks used to find them. You do not have to do anything, just play the game and if any rare elite monsters appears next to you a sound and visual alert will be played to warn you. Of course it will make your life easier if you try to kill all the rare monsters in the game to complete your achievements, but it will also works if you're a hunter looking for a super-rare spirit beast. <br />
<br />
Important<br />
The addon relies on your creaturecache.wdb file to work, you cannot &quot;find&quot; a monster again if you already found him once. To clear your cache just go to World of Warcraft\Cache\WDB\enUS (or enGB/deDE/esES/ruRU/frFR/etc... depending on your language) and delete the creaturecache.wdb file. <br />
<br />
If you want to make it even more easier, NPCScan.Overlay (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/npcscan-overlay.aspx) will display the spawn points of all the rare NPCs on your map and minimaps. <br />
<br />

But, you know Blizzard.<br />
Reforging is also going to be really useful.<br />
<br />
The new water engine looks really sexy, it's probably just going to be a lot of goo for people like me who plays the game at minimal settings though. :(<br />
<br />
Oh, and I'm glad you chose to promote NPCScan, it's such an awesome add-on, I used it myself to complete the Bloody Rare and Frostbitten-achievements. Plus it also works for a very special drake in Storm Peaks, if you get my point. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't they say that one of the restrictions in reforging was that you couldn't remove a stat and add it to an already existing one?<br />
<br />
Example you can't remove spirit to get more int, but you can remove haste from an item and get crit instead if there ain't any crit there. I don't know if it were just me who understood it like that, or they changed opinion since that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is (was), but the new Cataclysm races won't be receiving cities of their own. They'll have districts in their existing faction capitols. Gilneas will be a battleground.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BS, LW, Tailoring, JC, engineering.<br />
<br />
Shoulding they add enchanting to this list as well?<br />
<br />
What about all the dumb people (like me) that rolled enchanting + inscription when WoTLK came and found out its 2 bad professions? yes now an argument will start about if they are bad or not, but lets face it: JC + BS is atm the best combo for raiding as a healer: extra sockets, special gems, are alot woth then the poor ring enchant, the slightly underpowered shoulder enchant, and the mana return enchant? thanks but i avoid the meta gem that returns mana cause i just don't like the idea of randomly geting mana i prefer something steady.<br />
<br />
Blizz should start thinking how they stop making people reroll and waste time on the game threw professions and make proffessions more casual, the whole game is casual, geting epics is casual. <br />
<br />
Reforging: all professions, secondery skill or make it a cool quest line: it makes no sence wht JC = yes reforging, enchanting and inscription doesn't. And what about alchemy? you can always spill some pots on your gear that will cause a stat change. <br />
<br />
RP story about why reforging fits to every profession is something easy to make up. If not give the professions without reforging another option that is equivilant to reforging. Or allow reforging others gear: where you can trade reforging of items Via trade, or scrolls on AH.</div></div><hr />

I am a proud owner of the Time-Lost Proto-Drake due to it. Don't get me wrong, it still took ~6 months to find the damn thing, but I was alt tabbed camping a spawn at the time and if it wasn't for the noise on the addon, it would have flew right past me.</div></div><hr />

Yeah you know that there was a mob inside a huge area, but you still have to find it - and often someone else has killed it first.<br />
<br />
When a rare spawn enters your creaturecache, it means it can be targetted by you. When the mob window pops up, you simply click it to target and see if it's alive or dead. If dead, oh well. If alive, start looking around. If you can't see it right away, mount up and fly in one direction, while still rotating the camera all over the place. If you lose target, fly back and spamclick the popup to get it back. It only takes a few seconds to pinpoint the location that way and it really really REALLY helps having maximum view distance.<br />
<br />
I've gotten most of my rare kills with this addon. I have only actively looked for a few of them, some I got before using the addons, most just happened to pop up on my screen while doing other stuff...</div></div><hr />

It's a secondary profession so every player can invest in it.<br />
<br />
Also pretty sure reforging can only add stats that don't already exist on the item. So taking intellect instead of spirit won't happen. Maybe taking spirit for crit / haste. Dunno<br />
<br />
Is it just me that feels that if we get &quot;Random plate chest#2&quot; dropping with dps stats, some holy paladin can just pick it up and reforge it into good stats for him.<br />
change str to int, keep the crit, change arp to haste, change something to spirit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't they say that one of the restrictions in reforging was that you couldn't remove a stat and add it to an already existing one?<br />
<br />
Example you can't remove spirit to get more int, but you can remove haste from an item and get crit instead if there ain't any crit there. I don't know if it were just me who understood it like that, or they changed opinion since that.<br />
<br />
that's what I remember hearing as well. That you could only add x along with y and z as long as you only remove ONE of y and z and x wasn't already there to begin with</div></div><hr />

It will track rare spawns of all types (humanoid, beast, etc.) in the game, including inside instances and displays an audio / visual warning for them. It does it every time you encounter a rare spawn, regardless of how many times you come across a particular one without the need for any editing of the add-on files. It will track them whether you are on the ground or on a flying mount. I've been using this one for a few months now and I am halfway through both the Bloody Rare and Frostbitten achievements. I've also encountered lots of spawns in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms that I didn't know existed before using this add-on. <br />
<br />
<br />
This. SilverDragon has been around since TBC. NPCScan is just copying the idea. I'm sure both are great, but I'll continue to use the one I've been using for years that does the exact same thing (with a smaller footprint, as well). :)</div></div><hr />

When the mob window pops up, you simply click it to target and see if it's alive or dead. If dead, oh well. If alive, start looking around. If you can't see it right away, mount up and fly in one direction, while still rotating the camera all over the place. If you lose target, fly back and spamclick the popup to get it back. It only takes a few seconds to pinpoint the location that way and it really really REALLY helps having maximum view distance.<br />
<br />
I've gotten most of my rare kills with this addon. I have only actively looked for a few of them, some I got before using the addons, most just happened to pop up on my screen while doing other stuff...<br />
Mount up and fly in one direction? Don't waste your time.<br />
<br />
Land. Jade focusing lens. Mount if necessary, go in the direction it told you to go. Granted I mostly use them to help me pinpoint people in dalaran, but you know, they work just fine for this as well.<br />
<br />
I have both Frostbitten and Bloody Rare done; as an aside, no addon is going to &quot;help&quot; you get those achievements done any time soon. If you never go to Storm Peaks, you'll never kill a Vyragosa, etc etc.</div></div><hr />

Archaeology sounds like it will be fun, combining gathering with quests and all sorts of fancy stuff. Just hope it won't feel too grindy when levelling it on multiple characters.<br />
<br />

hopefully it doesn't have an effect on lower end systems. like making the pretty water an option to turn off to improve performance. if not, and blizzard forsakes their low end system customers it would be such a shame to only get kind of okay looking water out of it. :-\</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Incorrect. Blizzard has said on many occasions that the Goblins will have a city in Azshara. I have heard about Gilneas being a battleground, but that will be a bit unfair, the Horde having 1 more capital. I guess that is why there is speculation about Gnomeragon going back to the Gnomes. Party at my place if it is.</div></div><hr />

However, the Goblins will be getting a functional city of their own. It just won't come with all the bells and whistles of a capital and will be considerably smaller. It will have a direct access route to Orgimmar. In fact, the Goblin town will most likely feel like more of an extension of the Orc capital. The Worgen will be getting their own district in Stormwind. Most likely above the Dwarven District on the map. Yet, Greymanne City will also be a functional Alliance town. It's own flight path and whatnot. There is a battleground involving Gilneas but we're probably all aware by now that battlegrounds have never had any effect nor physical manifestation on the PvE world map. Gnomeregan has been claimed to be retaken by the Gnomes only to be lost again according to an old magazine article around the time Cataclysm was first announced. There are some suggestions that the Gnomes will actually retake only a portion of Gnomeregan which will act as, once again, a functional Alliance town in that part of Dun Morogh but that the Gnomeregan instance will remain as it has been with it's own Heroic mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
what you forget is castle Wolfenstein had pretty good graphics for it's time. his, and my point is the number of pixels in in-game water are not a major selling point in the game for us. i mean how many games have you bought solely on how water looked like in game? and how many games have been released in the past that hyped up their &quot;omg! it looks so real!&quot; graphics engine, but then completely fail when it comes to gameplay?<br />
<br />
so yes graphics are an important part of gaming, but they are no where near the importance of gameplay. because otherwise you might as well just be looking at rendered screenshots of a pretty game that you can't stand to play.</div></div><hr />

Didn't Blizzard say that orgrimmar will be destroyed and the horde will get a new capital city. (There is some time since i read/watched anything about this so I might be wrong)<br />
incredibly stupid idea, thinking that Orgrimmar is the only used capital city used by hordes, allies got Ironforge and Stormwind, while Hordes got Orgrimmar. <br />
Blizzard did not mention anything about gnomeregan getting an heroic version, only shadowfang keep and deadmines.</div></div><hr />

Graphics is great, but should be possible to reduce if your PC isn't that epic, and gameplay is way more important (Keen, anyone). Anyho, the water looks brilliant, but kinda stupid to have all new, epic graphics on the Worgen, Goblin and water, while the humans, orcs, and so on keeps their old.<br />
<br />
<br />
About the reforging. It's brilliant, just problem that they are removing much o' the stats (armor penetrate, defence and such). And a mayhap better alternative would be that the bosses had much higher chance dropping gear belonging to the classes in the group, so there won't just drop hunter gear all the time, especially when you lack hunters.</div></div><hr />
