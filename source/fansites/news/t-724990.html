<br />
Darkness -&gt; Still there<br />
Shadowweaving -&gt; Still there<br />
With Shadowform that's a 35% Damage increase.<br />
<br />
Then a USELESS 20% Spirit Hit Conversion, compared to 100% for Shamans and Druids.<br />
<br />
Well. Shadow still full of passive talents. Boring as hell, failed completely with cataclysm goals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Disc and Holy are nice, at least something is good.<br />
<br />
FYI, shadow priests has no need for a 100% Spirit Hit conversion, because they use cloth gear and there's going to be cloth with hit (since, you know, there are mages and warlocks). The same cannot be said about druids and shamans gear.<br />
However, shadow tree looks so... unchanged.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Razia</div><div class="date">2010-06-10, 01:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Almost makes me wonder if dealing damage with Smite is now somewhat viable while healing as Discipline. There seem to be enough talents to support the idea.<br />
<br />
Divine Accuracy provides you with hit cap with Smite.<br />
Divine Fury makes Smite a quicker cast.<br />
Searing Light allows Smite to do more damage.<br />
Penitence allows Smite to crit more often.<br />
Evangelism is a stacking buff that allows Smite to hit harder when you've cast Smite recently.<br />
<br />
So now that Smite is buffed up and all, what can this really do for us?<br />
<br />
Archangel allows you to consume your Evangelism stacks to increase healing by up to 15%, gain up to 15% mana back, and allows Penance to be used while moving.<br />
Atonement allows you to instantly heal someone for almost half of Smite's damage.<br />
<br />
Does this mean that Smite SHOULD be used while healing? You might want to say &quot;it's still a dps spell, treat it as such&quot;, but I think this is more than enough ideas to try it out. I'm going to do this for sure. You cast Smite and heal someone at the same time doesn't sound like a bad idea to me.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that it should be a staple in your healing rotation, but who knows, it might be.<br />
This is the spec I came up with. Let me know what you guys think.<br />

For you genius: <br />
- Spirit will most likely have the same effect for ALL healing classes, so the item budget is right<br />
- So Shamans and Druids got a 100% Hit-Spirit conversion, at this point we can say that Hit/Spirit will probably have a near equal Item Budget<br />
- For this obvious reason you will NEVER gear Spirit as a Shadowpriest, because hit will always have a far superior effect<br />
- The 20% bonus is completely wasted at will never take effect.<br />
<br />
That's what it's about, not about that we need a 100% conversion, but that a 20% conversion has zero effect for us, since we will gear the Hit-Gear<br />

<br />
Holy Focus: The best talent change. No more instant damage spells because a hunter pet is atacking us, and it will improve a lot priest questing. It will affect Hymn of Hope?<br />
<br />
Divine Accuracy: Is Blizzard trying to make smite spec viable? O.o<br />
<br />
Empowered Healing: It should be included in our passive healing bonus, and keep Holy Specialization talent instead.<br />
<br />
Healing Prayers: Desperate Prayer still not included<br />
<br />
Blessed Recovery: Useless as always.<br />
<br />
Deliverance: Heal spell should proc it.<br />
<br />
Holy Concentration: Still useless for PvP, it should proc on critical strikes like Blessed Resilience.<br />
<br />
Lightwell: I expected a buff, not a nerf. 6000 manas!!! Obviously a mistake or a placeholder.<br />
<br />
Choir Leader: Worst talent ever seen. I liked the idea of a talent buffing both hymn spells, but this one is a joke. Fortunatly it's just a placeholder.<br />
<br />
Improved Holy Nova: Interesting but pointless. I usually spam Holy Nova to do unimportant things. And I prefer to do aoe dps with Mind Sear. Maybe with a talent interaction could be worth it... Holy Nova procing Deliverance for example.<br />
<br />
Body and Soul: Leap of Faith sprint sounds fun.<br />
<br />
Chakra: I really hate that talent. I love my healing flexibility and to be forced to spam 3 spells every 20s to get a buff is a terrible idea.<br />
<br />
Thriving Light: Pointless. Mortal strike has shorter cooldown than duration even with Thriving Light. I would prefer a talent that refunds mana when healing targets affected by Mortal Strike. (It was a beta version of Serendipity)<br />
<br />
Circle of Healing: Perfect, less cooldown will make our gameplay less rotation. And more healing will make the spell decent for PvP. <br />
<br />
Guardian Spirit: Its glyph should be included on the basic spell, it's too good.<br />
<br />
-&gt;There are an excessive amount of PvP talents on Tier 7-8.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems we've lost a lot of our buffs to healing at the gain of some offensive abilities?<br />
<br />
Someone please correct me, if I got some of this wrong as all the different trees that are being posted have different, varying mistakes, but:<br />
<br />
- Losing 4% healing from Focused Power...but gaining an extra 3% through Grace (3 stacks of 4% VS 3 stacks of 3%), still a loss overall.<br />
- Losing 6% haste from Enlightenment (also 6% spirit which is the new main means of mana regen)<br />
- Losing 15% Int..but being giving 6% to total mana pool, so it could be possible that it's an even trade or a trade up because I don't know what mana pools will be like. Considering that PW:Barrier costs 13383mana to cast, they will probably be considerable. We also lose Meditation, but I believe everyone is losing that in favour of the Spirit changes. <br />
<br />
- Losing 20% on PW:S absorb (20% down from 40%), but gaining 5% from Twin Discipline. Still a net loss of 15%? Also, neither of these up the absorb of PW:Barrier?<br />
- My biggest shock: Soul Warding only reduces the CD of PW:S by 3 seconds...unless they are lowering the base cooldown of PW:S to 3 seconds, RIP Bubble spamming?<br />
<br />
So....despite the fact that in terms of throughput we are the lowest healing spec, and relied on our absorbs to make us useful, we're having alot taken away. And for what? So we can heal less and DPS more? I'm confused.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, the idea of healing while being offensive sounds like it could be fun...it's just...well, it's not like we'll be competitive with said offensive abilities...so lowest heals, lowest DPS...Are we just going to be a gimmick? =(<br />

It's a terrible passive talent that only will get a flashy look.<br />
So you're saying it's okay for Shamans and Druids to double dip, getting the Spirit AND the Hit, and it's okay for Shadow Priests to get the shaft and have to gear for Hit w/out getting the other benefits of Spirit. Yay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't call a talent that improves our ability to DPS with holy spells the &quot;best&quot; talent change.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Empowered Healing: It should be included in our passive healing bonus, and keep Holy Specialization talent instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like that it's lower in the tree. Disc could viably get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blessed Recovery: Useless as always.<br />
<br />
<br />
Combined with some of the other PvP talents in Holy it could be great<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy Concentration: Still useless for PvP, it should proc on critical strikes like Blessed Resilience.<br />
<br />
<br />
What?? Its not meant as a PvP talent, its a regen talent. By making it proc on crits taken it would be useless for PvE.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Holy Nova: Interesting but pointless. I usually spam Holy Nova to do unimportant things. And I prefer to do aoe dps with Mind Sear. Maybe with a talent interaction could be worth it... Holy Nova procing Deliverance for example.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the increased cast time of CoH, Holy Nova could be pretty useful. Especially if glyphed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Chakra: I really hate that talent. I love my healing flexibility and to be forced to spam 3 spells every 20s to get a buff is a terrible idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
I love this talent. It makes holy priests even more versatile by giving them the option to do better at a certain type of healing if/when needed. And you won't necessarily have to spam 3 spells every 20 seconds, especially if you want to stay in the same chakra state, since you'll already be casting those three spells most likely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thriving Light: Pointless. Mortal strike has shorter cooldown than duration even with Thriving Light. I would prefer a talent that refunds mana when healing targets affected by Mortal Strike. (It was a beta version of Serendipity)<br />
<br />
<br />
Not pointless. It takes 3 seconds off MS, which costs 30 rage to reapply. That's very useful, combined with the bleed reduction.</div></div><hr />

Did you factor in the + to priest shields from the mastery bonus?<br />
<br />
Also GCD is 1.5 seconds so knocking PW:S cooldown to 1 second means it will still be off cooldown before the GCD expires, thus it's still spammable.</div></div><hr />

Aha, no I did not factor the Mastery bonus in: &quot;Absorption: Improves the strength of shields such as Power Word: Shield, Divine Aegis, and Power Word: Barrier.&quot; There's the boost to PW:B. I hope the amount it improves it by is decent. :)</div></div><hr />

CoH has a 10 sec cooldown now according to the preview, so its actually a longer cooldown, even with the decrease from Chakra...<br />

<br />
As I understand it, there are going to be no mail or leather pieces with +hit and spellcaster stats. That said, it is somewhat saddening that we will need to collect extra gear (compared to Shamans/Druids) if we want to switch to a healing role from our Spell-DPS role.<br />
<br />
This, however, is nothing to be concerned about. What we should be concerned about is how many passive damage increasing talents we still have in the tree, and how undeveloped the &quot;Shadow Orbs&quot; mechanics seem to be... given that the &quot;Designer Notes&quot; say that Shadow is 100% complete - as of the first pass. Granted, that seems to imply that this will be tweaked more in a later pass, but some commentary to that effect would be nice. After all, we cannot really give that much feedback about this, given how little it changed. Just use our feedback from before - the tree is bloated with passive damage increases; it contains no fun mechanics ala the Druid Balance tree changes or the healing tree changes, thereby feeling like an &quot;also-ran.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another disappointment is that Silence is still chained from Improved &quot;Why Am I Speccing This?&quot; Compare to druid's *AoE* Interrupt - begins a chain for PvE abilities, is lower tier than Silence and is *AoE*</div></div><hr />

I am happy to see the return of smiter priests, looks like priests will be almost like the next druids with utility, two dps specs, and two healing specs (referencing them to druids because druids also have 4 possible options for spec). It is important that smiter priests don't have heals too powerful otherwise they will end up being nerfed in the first patch and forgotten.<br />

My guess is that the pushback reduction is removed form imp shadowform and replaced by the 5% raid haste buff but just not updated in the tooltip properly.<br />
<br />
As for the imp spirittap but no spirittap my guess would be that normal spirittap becomes a trainer spell instead of a talent.</div></div><hr />

In fact, the cookie-cutter spec is looking like we will have to take every talent in the shadow tree minus two points in our threat reduction to grab Inner Focus. I think Blizzard should make more shadow talents flavor talents and not raw dps upgrades to help mend how bloated it has become. I am very excited for the PI+Chakra Smite spec that I'm sure many will be testing once beta comes out. Seems like it will be good for automated spot heals while still maintaining decent damage output. I noticed the GCD reduction to Holy Nova that this smite spec would take for AoE as well.<br />
<br />
I don't like how a hybrid sub spec (smite) will have a proc and a damage CD (Surge of Light / PI ) and Shadow; the main damage spec will not. Also, there are tons of passive damage boosts in shadow that completely defy the goal Blizzard stated for Cataclysm.<br />

Summary:<br />
Disc - Nice changes<br />
Holy - Nice changes<br />
Smite Hybrid - Nice idea I hope stays implemented<br />

That's the one disappointment I have about Holy tree. I would prefer they get rid of lolwell and just give Holy a boring passive talent instead, something more useful... Like a 1% chance on all healing spell casts to glow and sparkle for 10 seconds with a buff that just says &quot;I feel pretty!&quot;. :|</div></div><hr />

<br />
besides, with that talent tree u can have a 51/25/0 speck with spirit of redemption and deliverance</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some suggested to make it a priest base spell, so we dont have to give up 1 talent point for it. Now that it is tied with a mandatory talent for holy, every holy priest will have it and cast and forget about it.<br />
<br />
Worse case possible it can just another way of marking a spot on the ground. But it will be more common in Cataclysm if this build holds. And smart groups will find uses for it.</div></div><hr />

Based on they said mana was going to be alot tighter in Cata, perhaps thats why they are implementing that smite can restore mana. Does seem a little backward to have a healer dpsing to recover mana, but guess you could argue that channeling hymn of hope to restore mana isnt time spent healing either. <br />
<br />
Penance on the move is interesting thou...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you see something better in the holy tree? O.o<br />
<br />
<br />
I <br />
Combined with some of the other PvP talents in Holy it could be great<br />
<br />
&quot;Could be great&quot; is different of &quot;could be fun&quot;. With the current holy talent tree you have to spend 25 talent points on PvP things. They should reduce the amount of PvP talents, make it better, and let players waste their talents on fun things not on talents that are exactly the same of resilience gems.<br />
<br />
<br />
What?? Its not meant as a PvP talent, its a regen talent. By making it proc on crits taken it would be useless for PvE.<br />
<br />
LOL. Ofc, t should be in addition no replacing the current Holy Concentration mechanic .<br />
<br />
<br />
I love this talent. It makes holy priests even more versatile by giving them the option to do better at a certain type of healing if/when needed. And you won't necessarily have to spam 3 spells every 20 seconds, especially if you want to stay in the same chakra state, since you'll already be casting those three spells most likely.<br />
<br />
Chakra hurts priest versatility, it doesn't improve it. Even if Heal-Heal-Heal rotation is the most common, we can't lose Chakra buff for casting necessary Heal-Heal-Binding or Greater-Heal-Flash combos. Chakra force players to play bad to get a buff, or it just frustrate players that prefer to use the correct spells. Chakra states are not a bad thing, the 3 spell in a row mechanic to get it is a terrible mechanic that even holy paladins don't diserve.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not pointless. It takes 3 seconds off MS, which costs 30 rage to reapply. That's very useful, combined with the bleed reduction.<br />
<br />
Yes, and more powerful shields and powerful healing costs more rage to warriors trying to kill us. But ey, you prefer that boring and pointless talent that just increase the endless list of pure PvP talents that holy needs to enjoy PvP, but still is not enough to be good as discipline. ¬¬º</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;IF&quot; they balanced encounters assuming all priests are using smite, then yeah that'd be lame.<br />
<br />
&quot;IF&quot; they are giving priests more options and versatility, and smiting isn't required but instead is a viable option, then that's awesome.<br />
<br />
I really really really doubt they're gonna try forcing priests into doing DPS if they don't wanna.</div></div><hr />

I thought Blizz was all about taking out the boring buff talents that increase numbers by this much and reduce things by that much. I'm still seeing plenty of that (Which was never something I had a problem with anyways), and worse still, a tree that has so many PvP talents that PvE priests are clearly going to be forced to take all of the exact same talents just to reach the top of the tree. So much for making unique talent specs. I couldn't hit Guardian Spirit without having to put points in Body &amp; Soul (bleh), failwell, and Chakra, which I think I might hate most of all. I understand healing is going to be different in Cata, reflecting different combat mechanics, but if Cata healing means I'm going to sit there and cast the same spell three times in a row, then count me out. I certainly don't do it now with any of the spells used in Chakra, not even renew.</div></div><hr />

Aye. Guess we'll have to wait. They can't do all trees at once. But things like &quot;Darkness&quot; really have to go.</div></div><hr />
