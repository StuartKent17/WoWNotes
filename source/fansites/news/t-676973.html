<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight - I'm still trying to fix a bug with the set appearance on some races, you'll have to wait a little to get a multi-race preview with helms. You can also check the Tier 10 Death Knight - Updated Video (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/tier-10-death-knight-updated-video/)<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin - Your helm is most likely bugged, and we don't know yet if your set is a robe or not. Once again we'll have to wait before I do multi-race or even female screenshots. <br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman - The only thing I can give you for the moment is a great big hug while you cry on my shoulder. <br />

Achievement - Random Hallow's End Masks<br />
At this point we have no plans to make any changes to event or the achievements involved in it. I wouldn't say my advice was incorrect as I know a lot of people who got the achievements complete since I posted, but yes, the randomness can win sometimes. We welcome your feedback and will consider making changes for next year. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20860797990-where-are-the-hallows-end-blue-replies-now.html))<br />

Hybrid and base class abilities<br />
We agree with Communism. We often give classes situational spells as base class abilities rather than as talented abilities for the same reason -- you're really only out a little gold by learning the ability. This is particularly a problem for hybrids. Nearly every rogue can find a use for Fan of Knives. Balance and Feral druids have much less use for Nourish. Heroic Throw is clearly a tanking tool.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, yeah it's cool if a hybrid class can make use of their ability regardless of role. However some of our balance problems currently are caused by hybrids being able to do too many things to well with the same spec. If the tool is good for the role that's intended to use it, there's a good chance it's going to be too good for the other roles. That's why we often prop abilities up with spec-specific talents. One of the problems with the Holy paladin tree is it doesn't grant enough healing focus for investing in the tree. At the same time, paladins can heal very well so it's not as simple as just going into the deep tree and smearing a bunch of +healing effects on existing talents everywhere. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677864812-dont-nerf-my-sacred-shield-bro--.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin<br />
Lay on Hands<br />
We don't think &quot;Sure I can heal myself for 25,000+ health as a dps spec or 50,000+ health as a tank, but not very often,&quot; is balanced. Abilities can be unbalanced even if overall a character is not. This isn't a non-issue just because it doesn't affect Arenas. Also, it doesn't mean paladins are being singled out for one-vs-one duel balance (though I'm sure I'm going to be reading that for months to come).<br />
<br />
If we gave warriors (especially Prot warriors) an ability to cause 50,000 damage in one hit with no preparation on a 90-minute cooldown, most reasonable players would call that a balance problem. The long cooldown doesn't save it. Beyond some point you can't balance a very powerful ability just by increasing the cooldown.<br />
<br />
In general, we've been moving away from long cooldowns anyway. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677862444-blizzards-vision.html))</div></div><hr />

Actually, T10 for paladins looks like your T7.5 gear.<br />
So probably you have exchanged sets with them - you better start preparing for looking like a pala in T7.5.</div></div><hr />

Next you're gonna see things like &quot;the boss is gonna stop attacking for 20sec, regaining his strength, after than, he might hit you with 100k dmg&quot; same as &quot;the boss is gonna stop attacking for 20sec, regaining his strength, after than, he might self heal for 1 million&quot;<br />

Seriously, LoH is a unique paladin ability that has a long CD. It might be OP in PVE since it provides a huge instant heal for a PROT pally.

I'm assuming that t10 is going to be acquired similarly to how t9 is currently acquired. That means there will be three different tiers, each being more difficult to obtain and the highest tear only being obtainable by doing 25 man heroic. I'm also pretty sure that it goes from left to right, left being the lowest and right being the highest tier.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree...<br />
This explanation is against all logic but may seem correct enough to satisfy the no-brains... that's simple manipulation.<br />

GC keeps making what he wants with the game and the classes, without real reasons, and without real explanations... just to please the whiners so that they stop crying..<br />
Besides, I'm still waiting to see evidences the paladin needs to be nerfed more in PvE...<br />

Yes, but that was reverted and there is no suggestion in this text that they are planning to go with it.<br />

No, that would just be bad... That would make LoH obsolete for prot and ret pallies. LoH is meant to be a unique class ability, not a unique talented/spec ability. I'm not sure what the problem is either... but from the sounds of it, kinds were QQing about pallies being OP in BGs. LoH can't be used in arenas, so there is no need to have it nerfed imo.</div></div><hr />

I can agree this spell is currently overpowered, no cast, no mana, full heal, it's huge...<br />
But each healing class has a major instant heal, except the paladin now...<br />
The question is &quot;why the hell did they touch to this spell in the first place?&quot; the mana-sacrificing version was great, we didin't need this spell to be mana-free...<br />
<br />
So Blizzard gives us something we didn't ask (who asked this spell to be free?) and then we loose more than we had in the begining because it's overpowered... that's stupid...</div></div><hr />

Seriously, LoH is a unique paladin ability that has a long CD. It might be OP in PVE since it provides a huge instant heal for a PROT pally. But if you are anything other than prot, then it's not that OP... Shamans can get INSTANT 20k healing wave crits every 3 minutes.... Make LoH heal for 50% less and reduce it's CD to 3 or 5 minutes would be a justified nerf, but this one isn't.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, No and NO!<br />
<br />
50% Health every 5 minutes, are you SERIOUS!?<br />
<br />
If anything, it should be 25% every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Especially with Rated BG's coming in Cataclysm... 50% Health every 5 minutes would be INSANE for that.<br />

50% Health every 5 minutes, are you SERIOUS!?<br />
<br />
If anything, it should be 25% every 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Especially with Rated BG's coming in Cataclysm... 50% Health every 5 minutes would be INSANE for that.<br />
<br />
I also think Lay on Hands should be changed to a HoT [like Frenzied Regeneration] and then paladins could get an extra &quot;Oh Shiz&quot; button in the form of a 25% damage reduction for 10 seconds... like bark skin.<br />
<br />
<br />
What's wrong with 50% health every 5 minutes? This won't pose any problems in PVP since you don't see prot pallies posing a huge threat in PVP that often. As I already mentioned, shamans have 20k instant healing wave crits every 3 minutes, that's well over the 50% mark for ANY PVP geared/spec character and way under the 5 minute CD mark. <br />
<br />
I think that Lay on Hands should remain a unique ability and should not be changed to how Frenzied Regen and Enraged regen work. Paladins do not need an extra o shit button, we have enough already, but we could use one to compensate if the LoH nerf goes live.<br />
<br />
Honestly, 50% health every 5 minutes is nothing to jizz over, with a lot of classes having healing debuffs, that number will hardly ever be at 50%, especially in BGs.</div></div><hr />

lol @ pvp people that like to pretend that pvp is the only thing that matters in the game. It isn't, it won't be, it will never be. World pvp you say? 1 tip, wintergrasp barely qualifies as world pvp anymore. The rest of the world pvp died out.<br />
<br />
Yes this nerf is justified, I do play a paladin and I see the logics behind this. But if you want to reason why it justifies a nerf, stop whining about only PVP. I want to take PVP fans seriously, but when they just whine that PVP/Arena is the only thing that matters, I quickly lose my respect (same with PVE fans that say that only PVE matters)</div></div><hr />

That's false... at least not on all encounter (once every 20 minutes)<br />
I'm glad you think it's funny to mock the paladins, but if they keep losing their spells one after one, they'll really end up with 3-buttons gameplay...<br />

The LoH as it's now IS very powerfull, and it may need to be attuned (for example, let's get back to it's initial version, consuming all the mana... who at Blizzard had the &quot;bright&quot; idea to make it free?) ... but allowing it to be cast only on someone else is removing an additionnal option to the Protection-Paladins in PvE ...<br />

and any palidan that disagrees.. I truly am sorry but you really need to understand class mechanics. I can own the hell out of a ret palidan as a feral druid, but if they have both bubble and lay on hands ready.. I'm usually hard pressed to do anything vs them.. It truly is sad when a class cannot relize when their own abilities make the most fail players able to compete.

Lay of Hands<br />
We don't think &quot;Sure I can heal myself for 25,000+ health as a dps spec or 50,000+ health as a tank, but not very often,&quot; is balanced. Abilities can be unbalanced even if overall a character is not. This isn't a non-issue just because it doesn't affect Arenas. Also, it doesn't mean paladins are being singled out for one-vs-one duel balance (though I'm sure I'm going to be reading that for months to come).<br />
<br />
If we gave warriors (especially Prot warriors) an ability to cause 50,000 damage in one hit with no preparation on a 90-minute cooldown, most reasonable players would call that a balance problem. The long cooldown doesn't save it. Beyond some point you can't balance a very powerful ability just by increasing the cooldown.<br />
<br />
In general, we've been moving away from long cooldowns anyway. (Source)<br />
<br />
<br />
my earlier post had been timed out cuz of amount of bad words i put in it time of cookie or something ran out...<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway.<br />
<br />
I AM GLAD I AM NO LONGER PAYING FOR THIS GAME (nor playing :P).<br />
<br />
Changes like this makes me wonder wtf are blizz devs doing? are you guys playing with ur balls or something all day? making such changes made straight from your ass. maybe balance arena and stop doing unnecessary changes that don't affect arena play etc.... BUT WAIT<br />
<br />
wait<br />
<br />
WAIT<br />
<br />
WAIT.<br />
<br />
I got you there Ghostcrawler, and I really love you. :)<br />
<br />
You guys want to nerf paladins (retribution especailly) under the ground.<br />
<br />
At first u can be quite frustrated as it's one of my alts that I play arena on as well. But on the other hand I really like those changes.<br />
<br />
nabz in bg no longer qq about paladins (omg he used lay on hand and i can't kill him :ccc wtf) and now can give us some offensive utility I guess...<br />
<br />
next step is to remove bubble ;) please. And i am totally serious (no sarcasm). it's so useless in current state and by removing it you could give us something LOL. this is the list of things u could give to ret pala:<br />
<br />
SNARE<br />
INTERRUPT<br />
GAP CLOSER<br />
MORE CC (lets say flashing shock that blinds the target for 5 sec or smth)<br />
or anything. MS could even do in current state.<br />
<br />
thank you and goodbye<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: btw plz give us something to do with shield and 1hand weap my pala loooks so imba in it i wanna do something with shield too as ret! plz :)</div></div><hr />

PLEASE.. don't be a moron.. you compare a dps class that can heal themselves to full twice (not vs a priest/warrior) to a feral druid who can pop frenzied regen that can barely heal themselves for 1.5k a tick per 10rage (which most druids dont fill up on when they pop it.. since most are feral pvp dps spec).<br />
<br />
Trust me.. if I had the time to lvl a palidan to 80.. I would pvp my ass off on it.. because that class just dominates in bgs/wintergrasp.</div></div><hr />

Hunters wear woden armors<br />
Paladins seem to wear DK armors<br />
Priests have the same look that they had when they just began in Northrend<br />
Rogues look like level 71 trash mobs<br />
...and Warriors wear pigs on their shoulders Oo'<br />
<br />
Is it only my opinion or the ability of Blizzard to create nice sets is getting close to the absolute zero?<br />
<br />
Let's all pray the shaman set will be cool :)<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: regarding to the Druid/Hunt/paladin stuff... Blizz designers can only draw woden textures or what?<br />
<br />
You only see wooden textures. WTF? Have you even looked at the hunter set? Anub'arak? &gt;8&lt; SPIDER PRIDE!<br />
Paladin is NOT DK only because it has skulls. I joked about &quot;they better not put skull und my pally or I'm going nerdrage&quot; but in the end the put skulls on paladins (which was obivous for icecrown) and it fits! It still looks holy and fucking awesome. Still, I think a lighter color would fit better (white/silver etc) but well, it's icecrown.<br />
Please look at the white/blue priest set. It's awesome. It almost beats T6 - Absolution (it would need a cool hood to actually beat it) The other colors look aweful (unfitting), it's impressive what colors only can change.<br />
Rogues wear disguises oO this is something completely unimaginable.<br />
Warriors wear vrykul armor fyi.<br />
<br />
In the end every class wears armor somehow resembling the lich kings servant that fits their class most. Here kicks in the problem with shamans. The only shaman in the army of the lich king is<br />
...<br />
Ner'zhul.<br />
Or did I miss something? Maybe it will be an ice revenant armor, would be the next nearest thing (because they are bound to elements and shamans are connected to elements)<br />
Or we get some awesome but in the first place random looking armor. In the battle with the lich king when in frostmourne there will be a flash back and we see Ner'zhul as an orc before fleeing from draenor and getting caught/killed by Kil'jaeden...doing some stuff whatever - wearing the shaman armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, LoH is a unique paladin ability that has a long CD. It might be OP in PVE since it provides a huge instant heal for a PROT pally. But if you are anything other than prot, then it's not that OP... Shamans can get INSTANT 20k healing wave crits every 3 minutes.... Make LoH heal for 50% less and reduce it's CD to 3 or 5 minutes would be a justified nerf, but this one isn't.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just want to appoint some things:<br />
-Istant cast is on 2 min, after patch, same spell as Druid (Tidal Force requires 3 min, instead, right)<br />
-That is only a Resto spell in Resto-talent-tree, not a Shaman general spell like LoH is for Pally.<br />
-In almost-full 245 resto set i crit in raid for around 20k, right, but that's PvE. PvP gear SP-oriented gives out around 16k, and that only IF the spell crits, thing not always assured (plus, halved by MS os similar, it reaches at most 8k in PvP).<br />
-LoH heals for your max health (PvP gear can bring you around 28-30k self-buffed) and crit for impossible amounts, bypassing any heal-halving tecnique.<br />
<br />
That standing, you can still state rightly that having a 2 minutes CD arena-usable is quite better than a 20 minutes CD NOT arena-usable.<br />
Fact is, my &quot;underpowered&quot; friend that this is ONE resource from a single talent-tree. You are pinpointing Nature's Swiftness like it's a contest between NS and LoH, but that is correct only assuming you don't have any other kind of resources.<br />
You can make yourself invulnerable from any and all kind of spell dispelling the undispellable with the double chance to kill (halved damage, WOW!) and refill yourself every 5 minutes for 12 secs. Plus, along with Hand of protection, you can do that twice in 5 minutes (ok, that's not the same spell, but against melee works the same way, aside from impossibility to attack). Plus, during those dramatic 5 minutes you can also boost your damage and healing for 30%, like not even Hysteria is able to do.<br />
Now, tell me: do Shamans have anything similar in the general spellbook? Not gained from spec, I mean.<br />
I won't make yourself think too much about that... Answer is: NO.<br />
<br />
The most funny thing here isn't like Pally are so uber-whiners that they whine for a nerf even when no nerf is yet officialized (like saying &quot;We don't need nerf, we are balanced exactly the way we are now, so we'll whine on any nerf will come&quot;).<br />
The most funny thing is that if Ghostcrawler states a true thing saying they will lower CD after nerfing LoH, you will almost surely be able to use it in arena along with your various stange lighty spells.<br />
And that means a BUFF in arena gameplay, since you will receive a new resource you actually don't have.<br />
<br />
Well played, really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I found LOH and Divine Shield mainly a problem because it prevents the developers to make the rets more offensive(i.e. lacking utilities like interrupts, real gap closers). Its not possible to pack both defensive and offensive abilities into one package without overpowering it. You can imagine if a warlock, with fear/seduce/spell lock, currently carrying pre-ret burst level ranged damage, will also carry a healthstone healing them to full health, and an invincibility shield from their voidwalker. Death Knights are also nerfed because of the same reason.<br />
<br />
Someone earlier pointed out, why suddenly the mana-free cost for LOH? Would it be ok if only holy (or prot, consider LOH as ohsht button for tanks too) gets the mana free portion, while the rets only gain full health but lose all their mana just like the old days.<br />

Nor calling the other classes &quot;God of LM/EOTS death due fall dmg&quot; or &quot;Boss with lots of adds&quot;, for dks and enhance shamans.<br />
But please GC, please stop trolling. You said paladin has 3 phases, let check it.<br />
<br />
Ret Paladin &quot;phase one&quot;: DPS, can instant heal using procs. Shamans, druids and priests can do the same thing. Can shield wall, but he won't be able to go to &quot;phase 2&quot; if he does that. If you can force phase 2 in less than 30 seconds, he won't be able to use his ofensive cooldown either.<br />
<br />
Ret Paladin &quot;phase two&quot;: Bubble and heal. If there is a priest or a warrior, it will be dispelled asap. His Holy Light cast is huge, so you can heal yourself while he does that. He will be OOM as soon this phase is over, so he will be hardly able to dps nor heal after this.<br />
<br />
Ret Paladin &quot;phase three&quot;: Heals himself back to full health. Once each 15 minutes. Cannot be used while stunned/interrupted/silenced. Does not work at arenas.<br />
<br />
Please notice that, once you used a cooldown, there is no way back. Now lets see a warrior:<br />
<br />
Phase one: DPS, -50% of target's spellpower.<br />
Phase two: Defensive, spell reflect, disarm<br />
Phase one: DPS, unstopable dps with bladestorm, -50% sp<br />
Phase two: moar spell reflect, shield block, interrupts<br />
Phase one: DPS, -50% sp.<br />
Phase three: Shield Wall, reflect, shield block.<br />
Phase one again: DPS with frenzy regen on, self healing, -50% sp<br />
Phase two: Spell reflect, more stuns, more interrupt, disarm.<br />
<br />
And he can go like that for ever. It's amazing how can he say that warriors can't use protection skills while doing DPS. Any good warrior should be able to preform his defensive abilitys with low cooldown, such as reflect, revenge and shield block. And wait, they cannot be dispelled. Every paladin ability can be dispelled.</div></div><hr />

On another side, thanx to stop calling all the people that doesn't agree with you with names like morons or idiots... you don't own the ultimate knowledge, you're no god, you don't decide who is idiot or not.<br />

Now, if you have real elements to discuss, everybody'll be pleased to discuss solutions on the subject... but if you keep saying &quot;you're OP, and if you don't agree, you're stupid&quot;, I don't think the discussion will bring anything intrestning.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
About the fact I compaired the LoH to NS (for example), the point is that each HEALING class in PvP will have a &quot;full-health-instant-spell&quot; with various CD durations, except for the paladin who will have to cast each of his spells... (who is still able to perform a correct cast in PvP now?)<br />
<br />
On the point that the Prot-adins will lose a panic button, it's a pain for PvE players, removing one option again, getting again the paldin closer to the 3-key-class.<br />
<br />
For Ret-paladins, getting a 20k heal once every 20 fights in BG is no big deal for anyone...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, anyway, there'll always be people who gets happy with the others's pain... the difference here is that in addition they come on the forum and mock you again and again... :-/</div></div><hr />

The stupidity of this post is unbelievable.<br />
<br />
1. Any warrior specced into Bladestorm is not going to be specced into the stuns and interrupts you're mentioning in Prot.<br />

<br />
1. Any warrior specced into Bladestorm is not going to be specced into the stuns and interrupts you're mentioning in Prot.<br />
2. Paladin Seals cannot be dispelled - automatic fail.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Charge Stun. Intercept Stun. Shield Bash. Pummel. Shield Slam dispell. Retaliation to banish all melee. AOE fear can be used as a interrupt. All base line. If you can't change your stance and gear with macros, it's not my fault.<br />
2. Nor can any weapon enchant. This is nothing special. Now let my shield wall undispelleable like yours is and I might stop complaning. And I'm not talking about Bubble. I'm talking about Divine Protection and Hand of Salvation, that are useless if there is a priest/shaman on the other team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It makes LoH more of an &quot;I just lost and now I want to run away&quot; ability - which is what it should be in BGs.<br />
<br />
Just because it takes 20 fights just for your amazing CD to come back up, doesn't mean that it still doesn't absolutely BLOW for the one guy who catches you with it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And every one of those stance switches costs the warrior 80% of his rage. You make it so that a ret paladin loses 80% of his mana when he casts Bubble, then we might be on to something.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that a ret paladin can still do 300% more damage inside of Divine Shield than an Arms warrior can do inside of Shield Wall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would be perfectly fine if it got changed to that. It seems perfectly reasonable and balanced for both PVE and PVP.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reuz</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It just makes me laugh that this ability has been around since vanilla days yet suddenly once devs mention a possible change / nerf to it every single pala basher comes out of the woodwork and suddenly agrees that palas need a nerf for LoH.<br />
<br />
Bottom line imho is f**k pvp, if you wanna play an mmo focused purely around pvp end play and balance for team play etc then go play Aion, its a good game apparently. but tbh the constant qq pala healed himself to full in wintergrasp gets old pretty quick, cant kill a pala solo in a bg then stop being a retard and group up with people, crazy to think they let a raid full of people into a zone yet pple qq they cant solo a prot pala. LoH cant be used in arena so its a non factor in small team close pvp where people wave their pvp epeen's the most.<br />
<br />
LoH has been around since vanilla and is a signature ability of the paladin, not a holy pala or a prot or a ret but pala as a whole.<br />
<br />
All the people that jump on the lolol nerf palas again train are morons, havent seen a single post in unrelated news from any of them before requesting a LoH nerf have you?<br />
<br />
Too many pvp players qq'ing around bgs, you serious? bg's? Pvp is and always will be an extra they added into wow for a bit of variety.<br />
<br />
Next time your in a heroic 25 man toc raid and a MT healer gets snobold while anotehr gets fire bombed and your pala tank drops cos hes now missing a life saving cd then lolol nerf pala at your repair bill then and a wasted encounter attempt. Balancing a game designed for pve around pvp whiners who 90% of the time are clueless about game mechanics outside their own class is a joke.<br />
<br />
And dev's to suddenly turn round now and go ah yes this ability we gave you since launch is now overpowered and to argue its use can be compared to a warrior doing 50k dmg every 90 minutes just boggles the mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is a clear sign that Blizzard and Ghostcrawler have absolutely no idea how to balance the Paladin and no vision. Whatever they do, expect yet another overhaul of the class into something completely new. Glad I switched to priest.<br />
<br />
Oh, and about time Blizz acknowledged that actually the Paladin holy tree is pretty crap. There is a good reason why Ret/Prot paladins can heal well but other healers who are not specced in their healing tree cannot. Its a symptom of the fact that Paladins get flash heal and holy light by 20 and that is pretty much their entire healing arsenal.<br />
<br />
If Blizz wants to solve this, for god sake sort out your attack power from your spell power and stop giving prot/ret spell power converting talents. Have a list of spells which are for Holy Paladins to solo with which scale with Spell Power (lets not make it complicated &quot;Holy Seal&quot; would do) and other stuff which scales with Attack Power for other Paladins.</div></div><hr />

Because Ret Paladins restore mana when melee dmg and when they get hit. Sure. Please do not cry over rage-starving, we are talking about something else. Do you think ret paladins have infinite mana?

I still can't see it being OP. It's annoying yes, i see this every time I fight a paladin.

Ah yes of course, silly us forgot that it should be you winning every single match and that if a pala survives a fight with you for even one round then clearly that class needs to loose the ability that allowed that, sure while we are at it any abilities you use youd like to see buffed? any extra dmg or crit you wanna throw into the pot of ideas, then we will make sure you win all 3 rounds all the time.</div></div><hr />

Bad analogy. You don't join a BG for 1v1. It's not that LoH is automatically win. It's a fight reset a bit like vanish. (Only that vanish can actually reset the fight if used properly..NREF VANISH!!)</div></div><hr />

Now the paladin is naked. I don't give a damn about how hard is to hunters dispell. But there are plenty of classes that can spam dispells, and dispells destroy paladins. <br />

<br />
I guess for me the annoying thing about the LoH situation is that it is now unbalanced after 5 years. How is that? I also realize having said that, that many players have felt it was unbalanced that entire time. In BG's and world PVP it is probably is unbalanced. Make it uncastable while engaged in PVP then. Or make it only castable in instances.<br />
<br />
There was a poster above who thought it was funny that pallies are crying about a nerf that hasn't even happened yet. Every class does that when you get hit on PTR's. I remember in BC when they were going to nerf the shit out of Life Tap on warlocks (play one of those as well) the whole lock community lit up the torches and grabbed their pitch forks and marched. Nerf didn't happen on live. <br />
<br />
The poster who thought turning into something similar to druid panic buttons I think may be on to something as well. Or at least the idea that we need to have some kind of survival cool down in its place.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LemonJuice</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When i started my paladin shortly after vanilla release LoH had 1 hour cooldown and consumed all my mana when used and you know what? It was perfect, you would think not once, but twice before wasting it, because you could use it properly only when you are about to go oom. But some smartass decided to make it 20 min cd, no mana loss and what not. Thanks to that, i might not be able to cast it on myself anymore.. give me back my 1h LoH, it was perfect the way it was, i'd rather have that, than a 20 min one, that i can't use on myself. The reason is that, while LoH can be raid saver, it's primary solo ability. 90% of the time (yeah, i pulled it out of my ass) i've been using it when 2 rouges jump on me in a BG, when im trying to solo group quest, or something like that. If they really nerf it, this will pretty much destroy the spell. I don't care what they intended for LoH, it's not group support ability, it's solo spell. If they remove the solo element from it, it's useless spell. <br />
<br />
Where is the problem? PvE - everyone is fine with it. Arenas - not usable there. BGs - oh noes! in a game with 15 players each side, dying and ressing every 5 secs, a paladin, that can heal himself to max once every 20 mins is OP? You can't balance the game around BGs, it's not 1v1, 3v3, 6v6, it's 2v5 6v8 3v1...show me a game, where a single paladin and his LoH turned the outcome of the battle..it's just silly to even think it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And your wanting the game to be balanced around 1v1 in a pvp bg zone with a raid full of people, open your eyes to the bigger picture. If your stupid enough to run about solo in a bg of wintergrasp then qq you couldnt solo that prot pala then maybe try running about with 2 people? or use a crazy thing called tactics and logic. And that time when your jumped my 3 enemies and about to die and that nice pala in your own team heals you up to full and blows his own cd to save your ass then im sure youll be strongly enforcing the 'being healed up to full once every 15 minutes' is op, yeh right</div></div><hr />

And, about bgs: You found a ret paladin, he used bubble, lay on hands and killed you. He has forberance, he is out of mana. After 15 seconds, you ress. You kill him before he manage to get in melee range. You get your flag back. (y)</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit:If you ever played a resto shaman, then you would have the knowledge and skill to macro NS/Tidal force so that you have about a 90% chance to crit with healing wave.<br />
<br />
<br />
It bypass MS in the sense that even with MS up you will get a half-health bar... And since you will be around 20% when that happen, if will take you to 70%.<br />
A LoH crit, instead, means a real bypass since you will get to 100% even from 10%.<br />
<br />
I *AM* a Shaman Resto, and yes, I use NS along with Tidal Force, and yes, with PvE gear I get around 95% crit (100% with raid buffs)... Thus, in PvP, my crits are around 25%, increased by 60% that means 85% crit. Unless you are saying I should drop my MP5 PvP gear to heal with a full Elemental PvP gear that should bring me around... 90%, maybe.<br />
My point is that 85% is not an ASSURED crit.<br />
That is exactly what I was stating there.<br />
<br />
On an unrelated note, just try to be Shaman in arena and purge Avenging Wrath instead of healing yourself or kiting like desperate while Pala try to burn you down along with his 5 secs ranged istant stun... You are done for before getting to avening wrath, puring a lot of useless things on the way there.<br />
Waste even a mere GCD on the wrong spell during Pally-burn and you are DEAD.<br />

Then, let's take GCs advice and give Hunters a shot that does 50,000 damage on a 20 minute CD. Cause, I mean, It's a 20 minute CD right? So you still get 20 minutes to beat me without it, right? And you'll ress in 15 seconds and kill me, right?<br />

lol it gets better, yes of course being able to instantly one shot someone in game compared to healing yourself up is completely comparable and a fair analogy, once again you fail at grasping to concept of bgs which is the only location LoH comes into effect in the terms you speak off.<br />
<br />
Try befriending a healer or another player in bgs and see how you get on, or crazy idea, team up with one of these crazily op palas running about and youll never loose.<br />
<br />
If your with a healer and your fighting a pala on his own then you can win whatever letter of the alphabet fight you want, stop trying to justify arguments around 1v1, its NOT balanced and the game never will be, as i said open you eyes to the bigger picture. Until rated 1v1 bgs are brought in learn to group up with people and play like a proper team, not i r hunter'ing across the map on your own, and for the last time, its bloody bg's, this is a pve game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ikkatsu</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's wrong with 50% health every 5 minutes? This won't pose any problems in PVP since you don't see prot pallies posing a huge threat in PVP that often. As I already mentioned, shamans have 20k instant healing wave crits every 3 minutes, that's well over the 50% mark for ANY PVP geared/spec character and way under the 5 minute CD mark. <br />
<br />
I think that Lay on Hands should remain a unique ability and should not be changed to how Frenzied Regen and Enraged regen work. Paladins do not need an extra o shit button, we have enough already, but we could use one to compensate if the LoH nerf goes live.<br />
<br />
Honestly, 50% health every 5 minutes is nothing to jizz over, with a lot of classes having healing debuffs, that number will hardly ever be at 50%, especially in BGs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lay on Hands isn't restricted to a Prot Paladin.<br />
<br />
50% Free Instant Heal for a Ret would still be /facepalm worthy for anyone else trying to kill him.<br />
<br />
If you are so dead set against having it changed in its current form for a Prot Paladin... let's make it a High-Tier prot talent...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not the same. <br />
<br />
Player A and Paladin duel in a BG: <br />
<br />
1: A is about to kill the paladin, but he uses LoH and kills him instead. or<br />
2: A is about to kill the paladin, he uses LoH, but suddenly 2 more of A's team join the fight and heal A. LoH is useless.<br />
<br />
Now for the hunter with the 50k insta kill shot.<br />
<br />
1: A show up, ready to enter the battle and the hunter just takes him out like that.<br />
<br />
You can't really compare 50k instant dmg, that will take down everyone, with a heal, that gives the paladin bigger chance to win IF someone doesn't join the fight...and in BGs being able to do 1v1 is next to impossible, unless you go to the border of the map, just to do this. GC's example is full of fail. LoH and instant kill are not the same.</div></div><hr />

Can you just explain me HOW the use of LoH is supposed to kill a hunt?<br />
If you know a bit your class, the paladin should never be able to hit you at all... so giving him 20k more life every 20 minutes is such a big deal that it would immediatly give him the victory?<br />

And you fail to grasp whats been said by myself and about 10 other people, this game is not balanced around 1v1, and ffs your a hunter as others said learn to kite.

<br />
I wouldn't complain if they change this with a proper reason. Exorcism got changed rapidly too recently. It was fine, I think. Also because there was an obvious reason.<br />
I think the problem is maybe that blizzard themself not have a perfect conecpt of the LoH change (it should never have went live, remember) and are struggeling to not say to much before the know what they will do. Still they could at least say why they want to nerf it, is it really pvp or pve (warriors complaining that paladins are soo much better tanks because of the cooldown). If it is only for BG pvp...I agree with you. Leave it. (It wasn't that way all the time though)</div></div><hr />

I may be remembering a different game here, but the principle is the same. The quickest and easiest was to help balance LoH to fix all the QQers would be a mana cost by a %, or, as the description says, heals a friendly target; and only a friendly target. It wouldn't be the first helpfull spell/ability blizz made non-castable on the caster. Looks at rogue's Tricks of the Trade ability. I'd love to be able to self TotT for the 15% damage buff, but that would be a bit OP. Im not gonnna whine here and says pallies are OP, i have about a 50/50 ratio when it comes to downing then in BGs and WG. It does however, seem to me, that blizzard likes to take their time about addressing and fixing problems, and most of the time, has to go back and fix it again down the road. re-work is costly blizz :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grisou</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, let's edit then - <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I'll assume you really asked informations on how to kite a Paladin and that's not a useless taunt... here are some tips...<br />
<br />
First of all, you NEVER trinket on the Repentance. It breaks at the first damage, allowing you to flee and removing a CD to the paladin. Just wait the first hit you'll receive and get away, you'll lose some life, but you'll be able to trinket on the hammer, that will prevent mass further damages.<br />
<br />
Then be aware that the hand of freedom can't be cast while the paladin is trapped in ice... It's not a dispell, it must be used preventively by the paladin... so, when you see a paladin with an orange drawing turning under his feet, don't cast slowing effects, and keep them for later, when the HoF is gone and the paladin will slowly die at 30-40yds under your arrows...<br />
(PS: you also can dispell the HoF ... )<br />
<br />
You have plenty of ways to slow/stop a paladin. He has some defensive ways to prevent this, but knowing them and playing carefully will make you a no-match against any paladin... whatever the stuff you're wearing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mirrorzoom</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and if you expect pally to freedom your crab snare, why would you put down frost trap anyway?<br />
<br />
crab snare, shoot him, if he freedom, scatter into a freezing trap. <br />
<br />
Run 40 yards away, wait for freedom to drop, conc shot, and move on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiss</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then, let's take GCs advice and give Hunters a shot that does 50,000 damage on a 20 minute CD. Cause, I mean, It's a 20 minute CD right? So you still get 20 minutes to beat me without it, right? And you'll ress in 15 seconds and kill me, right?<br />
<br />
Why is it OK when it works in the paladin's favor, but suddenly sounds stupid when you turn it around?<br />
<br />
Again - the chance of losing Fight B should not grant the guarantee of winning Fight A.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both you and GC like to compare one skill that heals back to full to one tha instant kills someone. I think you should learn some more about pvp, before even considering that.<br />
<br />
And again:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Again: 1v1 is not balanced. It will never be. Get over it. <br />
<br />
<br />
And again²: Lay on Hands is overpowered, period. But saying that only Paladins are one man army is stupid. You want to nerf us? Go ahead! But at least agree that Lay on Hands is the smallest problem in a BG where classes can summon armys, one shot multiple targets due fall dmg.<br />

Edit: Anyhow, I think it is a bit pointless to try arguing on the forums how this skill so and so and counter this and that. Each fight tends to be unique, in the players, gear, skill and knowledge. This is before the environment comes into play. <br />
<br />
LoH doesn't have much of a counter short of applying a healing debuff effect, but bubble you can use to distance yourself and wait it out instead of hugging the shiny bubble effect.<br />
<br />
In the end, if a Ret kills someone in the third life after LoH, he is OP. If someone kills a Ret after the third life, what does that make him? Noob, undergeared? <br />
<br />
If Paladins lose LoH, won't they need something to compensate for the loss of survivability? All of this is a bit moot though, not knowing what the change in the end will be.</div></div><hr />

And that's the public Blizzard catters to when choosing to nerf something to please the most of their money crowd... After all there are more non-paladin players than paladins players (it's one class against all others) and nerfs will always be viewed by the &quot;community&quot; as deserved than anything else. &quot;we checked our player base and most of them say it's deserved to remove the ability to use any weapon for ret paladins!&quot;<br />
<br />
0 resilience, no kitting ability, he considers himself doing 0 dmg to the paladin (so he will aways use art of war for exorcism, and if he can't melee you, he can't exo you, sry), you simple can't remove HoF and drain his mana... He really thinks that J/CS/DS can be used together non stop without any CD or GCD issues (since the paladin is using &quot;all&quot; his tools). The fact is that you probably got &quot;ganked&quot; by a ret pally in BGs and put everything that happened to you on his bill.<br />
<br />
And since we're talking about Battlegrounds (since LoH can't be used in arenas and 1v1 will never be balanced), you won't get him with all his CDs avaiable everytime.<br />
<br />
Also this PoJ should deserve a nerf... if it was avaiable, lol.<br />
<br />
And all this is ok for druids and other hybrids, but not for paladins... lol. Still trying to understand how did they manage to actually consider to fix ret paladin spec at 1st place at the end of TBC... maybe it was another dev team? Probably.</div></div><hr />

Grisou, feeling sad and seriously thinking about quitting WoW... fed up with the ongoing nerfs... and the ongoing nerf demands...<br />
<br />
<br />
Ironic that you call the people that see the point 'no-brainers' when you yourself dont see it.<br />
<br />
The point was comparing an Op ability with 'another imaginary one', in this case that 50k hit from a warrior.<br />
<br />
Time for prot palas to step down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we gave warriors (especially Prot warriors) an ability to cause 50,000 damage in one hit with no preparation on a 90-minute cooldown, most reasonable players would call that a balance problem. The long cooldown doesn't save it. Beyond some point you can't balance a very powerful ability just by increasing the cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes. Giving a lay on hands type ability to warriors would be over powered because they also have snares, interrupts, fear, gap closers and mortal strike.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buffwhite</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a lot of alts being leveled right now. I currently have 4. Coming across a paladin in world pvp is almost as bad as coming across a rogue in world pvp when you don't have your pvp trinket equipped. You're basically done if he's similarly geared/skilled. The pally is gonna have his LoH up probably, which means you are going to have to kill him 3 times. If he wants to steal your mining node, he doesn't like shams or he just feels like a guaranteed kill, he can get it by blowing his cd's. Unless you are a pally or super extremely twinked, you aren't going to be able to kill him 3 times before he kills you once. <br />
<br />
I don't mess with pallies anywhere if I can help it because I dread their cd's and i always thought it was shit that they had so many ways to survive. HoJ and heal, Repentance and heal, Bubble and heal, Lay on Hands, insta flash heals, the holy whirlwind heal they have (i think they have a small hot as well). Ugh. I'm just glad some of their survivability is out the window now. Most of their damage is already unmitigated by armor, being Holy damage (also the only current magic school with absolutely no resistances for it). Now a pally will actually have to think twice about attacking another class in BG's and World PvP instead of running headlong into 5 ppl and saying &quot;i'll be alright&quot;. (again, this also being a big part of the problem with pallies while leveling where the bubble is unbreakable so they get the benefit of the full duration along with LoH, not just at the level cap)<br />
<br />
I know PvP is not balanced around 1v1. But 1v1 is a lot of where PvP happens. While leveling, while going up the ramp in WSG, in 2v2 arenas when both healers/dps die simultaneously, while defending a node against a lone attacker in AB because Horde wants to zerg stabs, while mining, while questing, blah blah blah. It matters, so you can't just say &quot;I have this OP ability, but since I can't use it in arena, continue to let me have it, because 1v1 is meh.&quot;<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
<br />
Mostly talkin about rets here, and from what I gather, GC was too. <br />

Comparing something with an imaginary possibility is ok if it compares similar things... here, he compares things that have no relation to each other... so this IS manipulation...<br />

THAT is an important problem too...<br />
Depending on who's talking, the discussion changes his way by switching from Prot to ret-paladins attacks...<br />
<br />
Being clear once and for all; nerfing the LoH will nerf ALL specializations... so if the point is to reduce Ret survivability, ok, but then, how to explain the Prot-ones lose their spell too?<br />
<br />
If GC wants to nerf a specific specialization, he shoulr work on specific skills, and not on general ones that will affect all the other specs, perturbing once again the balance...</div></div><hr />

I mean, it's wrong now as now that any tank have a use in PvP envinronment... If that was meant to happen prot talent tree would contain something that justify that, shouldn't it?<br />
<br />
I mean, take a Warrior. In his spec tank you can easily take him down. Slowly but, hey, any healer can achieve that. No sudden burst damage, a good chain-stun pretty pointless in defensive stance, spell reflect and a lot of useful skills... But in the long play most classes can nuke the crap out of him.<br />
Melee classes (aside from Palaretri, I think) don't stand a chance on the other hand. So rogues, DKs (not sure here), other warriors, Shaman Enhancement are lost in the urge of surrender themself and just run away.<br />
<br />
That alone, I think, is wrong. Tanks shouldn't exist in a PvP content, and this seriously need to be nerfed 'cause it's stupid to create hopeless situation in PvP.<br />
Almost like it's stupid to make stall situation exist when two healers or DOTter and healers are left alone in an arena match (speaking of which, I fought alone against a Spriest 26 minutes the other day).<br />
<br />
Problem here is bigger than that extent, with pally, because putting aside retri power for a moment they can create a spec which make them &quot;tank&quot; while healing and bursting, which with a Warrior or any other class never happens.<br />
Protection talent-tree shouldn't never meant to exist in such a deep build inside arena... Not a such a high rating, at least.<br />
I mean... I met Protection-Tank in 2v2 teams on my way, and they were all losers (which in rare cases are strong against strange setups, I suppose).<br />
Pally? They give serious troubles.<br />
<br />
So, here is the point: fine with retri burn or holy invulnerability, but please someone make the prot tree useless in arena or PvP aside from Flag Carriers. That is ridiculous.<br />
Fix that, and THEN start to work on holy/retri troubles.<br />
First big troubles, then &quot;small&quot; troubles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He gave an example of probably the first thing that came to his mind when he wrote that post. <br />
<br />
Should have he mentioned giving rogues a 50k heal vs a paladins 50k heal but on a 90 minute cooldown( crazy i know ) you and others like you would have still found a way to go around it. But that's not the point you see, as other posters here have pointed out, a paladin has 3 lives while you only have 1, in world pvp, and BGs.<br />
<br />
You probably have no idea how its like to have to outplay a paladin 3 times just because he can press 2 more keys and reset the fight over and over.<br />
<br />
As for PvE side of things, ive asked the officers in my guild multiple times to reroll to my warrior which is very good geared only to be told that &quot;1 warrior tank is enough per guild, paladins are better, sorry&quot;.<br />
<br />

I agree 100%. That blue post made me LOL.<br />
<br />
I'll admit, LoH is super OP, but they chose the absolute WORST way to nerf it. From a protection paladin's perspective, have it heal 50% instead of a 100%, have it drain all our mana again, make it so you cant use them in bgs, theres a 100 better options than basically destroying it for any spec besides a holy. I knew a nerf would come eventually, just didnt expect such a retarded solution.<br />
<br />
Best solution IMO.. make it 50%, have it cost a good chunk of mana, move Imp LoH down in the holy tree and alow it to be spec'd back up to 100%..<br />
<br />
An &quot;extra life&quot; with a mana pot in one button is super OP. As a player whos loves everything about paladins, I think it needs a FAIR nerf.</div></div><hr />

The long cooldown doesn't save it. Beyond some point you can't balance a very powerful ability just by increasing the cooldown.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong, I'm afraid. If your LoH is to heal you for 30k for example(100% of your health), and you have MS on you. It's only going to heal for 15k.<br />
<br />
As ret LoH crits very few and far between. The only reason it can crit is because its a heal mechanic.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizz really need some new spokesmen. They are retarded and can't grasp common English. When they make mistakes it ads to the emo and really doesnt help matters.<br />

Hurray. lets compare healing to one-shotting. GG Sherlock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if its PvP thats causing all the trouble... well thats just retarded... the only place LoH even comes into play is battlegrounds, and then its pretty much once per game since I cant recall much of any BGs lasting more than 20 mins these days.<br />
So we have people whining about paladins being able to heal themselves fully once every battleground, and from what ive personally seen, it usually just delays the paladins violent death for a few more seconds anyway. I haven't been afraid of a paladin in a long time but then I dont run around by myself like a moron in BGs.</div></div><hr />

In principle of it it would be like taking totems away from a shammy, mage food and ports away from a mage, summon stone or SS away from a lock, those are ALL things that make each of those classes its own. I understand you are mad cause o i feel like i have to kill a pally 3 times what about rogues and their stun locks? ppl QQ about that but nothing is done, it just seems like blizz is out to destroy anything that is Pally, might as well take the class out of the game if your going to not let us cast LoH on ourselves. Instead of taking it away why do you make it a 20 min CD regardless and make it so we loose ALL our mana for idk like 10 seconds or something that way its as if we &quot;cant do anything&quot; for 10 sec allowing those that are being babies have a bit of an advantage.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nwo</div><div class="date">2009-11-03, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It bypass MS in the sense that even with MS up you will get a half-health bar... And since you will be around 20% when that happen, if will take you to 70%.<br />
A LoH crit, instead, means a real bypass since you will get to 100% even from 10%.<br />
<br />
On an unrelated note, just try to be Shaman in arena and purge Avenging Wrath instead of healing yourself or kiting like desperate while Pala try to burn you down along with his 5 secs ranged istant stun... You are done for before getting to avening wrath, puring a lot of useless things on the way there.<br />
Waste even a mere GCD on the wrong spell during Pally-burn and you are DEAD.<br />
<br />
Crits on spells are not double like melee, therefore if you have 20k hp, LoH will crit for 30k. If you have an MS effect on you, it will crit heal for 15k which will not bring you up to 100% health if you are at 10%.<br />
<br />
Dude, don't complain about paladin stuns... You have grounding totem on a 15 second CD (untalented) while a ret pally (PVP spec/talented) has a 40 second CD on his ranged stun. L2grounding totem?</div></div><hr />

Announce a nerf to a some kind powerfull but not gamebreaking ability<br />
<br />
community QQ about this nerf<br />
<br />
Blizz nerf other spell in background without any QQ<br />

before ptr going live, Blizz say oh well, we will not nerf &quot;that OP spell&quot; that much finally<br />

&quot;This isn't a non-issue just because it doesn't affect Arenas. &quot;<br />

... really.. use double negatives more.. and make sense more.. plz?<br />
<br />
AND REALLY... if blizz cannot relize that palidans AS A CLASS are OP then they are idiots...<br />
<br />
and any palidan that disagrees.. I truly am sorry but you really need to understand class mechanics. I can own the hell out of a ret palidan as a feral druid, but if they have both bubble and lay on hands ready.. I'm usually hard pressed to do anything vs them.. It truly is sad when a class cannot relize when their own abilities make the most fail players able to compete. I'm sorry but re-roll if you want to actually be competitive, because right now your just a nub face-rolling your keyboard to beat anyone.<br />

<br />
There's two ways to interpret the delay. Either the set is receiving an enormous amount of attention to detail, moreso than the other sets, or the design team had no idea where to go with the set and are playing around, slapping things together until something looks passable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Rogue: <br />
Fixed bug which allowed Rogues to wield two weapons at the same time. This was never intended to happen. <br />
<br />
Paladin:<br />
Paladins can no longer target self with Lay on Hands as the spell was intended to help others. <br />
<br />
Warrior:<br />
There will now be a 15 second cooldown when changing stances to prevent players from breaking Fear effects too often. <br />
<br />
Priest:<br />
Shadowform now lasts five minutes with a ten minute cooldown. Mana cost reduced slightly. <br />
<br />
Druid:<br />
Innervate now only works on caster. <br />
<br />
Hunter:<br />
Hunters can now be affected by their own traps. This should add a sense of danger, and increase the Hunter's need to strategize his decisions</div></div><hr />

i dont mind nerfing pallys, or anyone for that matter.<br />
<br />
but really? LoH? based on battlegrounds? Isnt there alot more things ruining bgs than pallys with loh? for instance afkers? or the lack of stuff to buy with honor?<br />
<br />
really...LoH? Does blizz just have a random wheel that has pallys abilitys on it sitting in a office somewhere, and they just randomly roll it and decide thats what they are gonna pick for this week? <br />
