Congratulations to the entire guild for an impressive achievement, and for spending so much time with nemex (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/551976-nemex) without eventually deciding to kill him. I know I would. <br />

New Official Website Feature - Companions and Mounts<br />
Totally missed that blue post earlier this week, you can now track your mounts and pets on the official website! You can now go to the Companions &amp; Mounts tab of your profile to get a list of all the mounts and companion pets you currently own + the ones you don't have yet! <br />
<br />
The list also includes a couple of filters, a small modelviewer, and information on where to get the ones you're missing! <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
We recently updated the character profile system with a brand new feature to help you track your loyal companion pets and stalwart mounts.<br />
<br />
A visit to your character profile will reveal a new heading entitled “Companions &amp; Mounts.” There you’ll find a complete list of in-game pets and mounts that your character can discover throughout Azeroth (and beyond). The list is conveniently divided between those that your character has already collected, and those that you have yet to find.<br />
<br />
Still pursuing a particular pet? Mad for a magnificent mount? Just mouse over the object of your desire in the Companions &amp; Mounts page and you’ll see information that should help make your next hunt a success. You can filter the results to make it easier to find pets and mounts from a particular source, or sort them by rarity to help you plan future collecting expeditions.<br />
<br />
The update is live, so head on over to your character profile to visit your pals right now!<br />

I would guess it's because of the &quot;A Legendary Collection&quot; achievement, as it now requires Dragonwrath, they probably got it before and &quot;lost&quot; it after 4.2, losing 15 points or something like that.<br />
<br />
2005 + 15 = 2020 = 2000 + 2 achievements</div></div><hr />

I heard the Web Team (Which developped this feature) is the same as the Class Design team. And the team that fixes bugs. And the team that handles databases and need to overcome technical limitations that prevent account achievements. <br />

Being the first to kill bosses on heroic doesn't equal better. The game has more than just raids you know...</div></div><hr />

then they would end up with 2015, since the 2000-point achieve gives 10 more.<br />
on a sidenote: as impressive as this is, isn't it a bit pointless to post before they really have all currently available achievements (meaning also getting heroic rag+legendary)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get some perspective.<br />
<br />
There's no point to anything in this game. The point of getting gear is either to just have it (no point) or to raid. But then the point of raiding is to... raid more? What happens when you finish all the heroic content? What's the point of that?<br />
<br />
The point is to have fun and feel accomplished.<br />
<br />
There is no more &quot;point&quot; to raiding than there is to achievements. Just different things to accomplish. I'm so sick of people downplaying achievements as if it's some inferior way to spend your time on WoW. There's just no basis for that line of thought, other than not wanting to admit that someone else has done more than you. You want to say &quot;I'm better than you. I raid. You just have a bunch of achievements.&quot; So you downplay it to feel better?<br />
<br />
Considering how much time and dedication it takes as a whole to get all those guild achievements, I can respect the accomplishment of breaking 2000 points more than I can world first on raiding. World firsts only have to work for 2 weeks or so. The guild achievement people have to work constantly.<br />
<br />
I dare anyone to give me one good reason why raiding has more &quot;point&quot; than earning achievements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, web site developers are totally the same people who do astronomical amount of C++ coding required for cross account achievemtns or who do the bug fixing. Totally.<br />

So instead of spending time doing something useful they decide to waste it doing achievements. Achievements are not content. I wish people would stop encouraging Blizzard by doing achievements. <br />
<br />
You think ANYTHING in a game is &quot;doing something useful&quot;??? It's a game. EVERYTHING you do is the very definition of &quot;wasting time&quot; and the opposite of doing something useful. In fact, that is why we do it, play games - to do what is fun, for a change, instead of doing something useful.<br />
<br />
What they consider fun is none of your business. If people enjoy doing achievements, are you to say they can't?<br />
<br />
Pro tip of the day:<br />
If you want to do something useful, try charity or work or raising children. Raiding and PvP and doing &quot;content&quot; is not useful in any sense of the word.<br />
if you want to play a game and fun - do whatever you feel like doing, without worrying about Mobius thoughts about what is &quot;useful&quot;.</div></div><hr />

yeah man totally<br />

too bad the only reason you never saw those other zones was because there was A) nothing in them (all of Odus) or B) you were grinding AA in Fungal Forrest for eight hours a day. but yeah, EQ had way more content, sure whatever.</div></div><hr />

I wish people like you would stop posting on forums, thank you.<br />
Achievements are in the game. That means they are a part of the game, a part of what you can do.<br />
Just like archeology. Is it useful? I don't think so.<br />
Just like PVP is useless for me, achievements might be useless to you.<br />
I love achievements and I'm happy to say I have over 13k.<br />

<br />
First of all that's not irony. I didn't raid because in order to raid in Cata you have to be in a raiding guild. I don't want to play the game on someone else's schedule I want to play when I want. LOL Arena? Seriously? Who cares about arena? PvP is not balanced for arena. I never said Everquest is better. Everquest was a horrible time consuming grind and there was nothing to do but raid when you hit max level.<br />
<br />
My point about most achievements is that there's no reward; no loot or money or experience. Nothing. At least when you raid or do something else you get something in return and when you've gotten all the loot you need then there's no reason to play any more and it's time to quit.</div></div><hr />

Par for the course.Achievement hunting is a perfectly acceptable way to play the game. Blizzard really doesn't care how you play the game, as long as you are in fact playing the game and having fun. They provide all sorts of things for people to do, in game and out. I would wager one of the primary reasons why you never explored those zones in EQ was that you had no reason to go there, am I right? Do you think a zone where players have no reason to go is a good use of design resources?</div></div><hr />

Lots of people. Are you dumb, or so desperate to win the argument you're using silly reasoning ?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Dude. WHAT ? Nothing ? There are TONS of rewards for Achievements. Titles. Mounts. Pets. Shiny items. Tabards. Hell even gold, because when you are chasing achievements like BC rep, you are mostly going to solo Outland dongeons and make a couple hundred gold each day in the process.<br />
<br />
Just because you have no clue and no fun in doing achievements shouldnt mean trying to trash them so bad. Achievements were a HUGE source of fun for me while waiting for raids back in 2010. Now I'm out of this game, but Achievements hunting remain the funniest and most thrilling part of Wow for me.</div></div><hr />

WoW is dead to me, it had its moments during vanilla, mostly due to it being &quot;fresh&quot; and &quot;new&quot;. Those two no longer applies.

Well, we don't get paid to help them do their game. We're gamers. We play their game. Considering they already have the backbone set for the system they can't be that far off. If it's something half-arsed like for example the raid browers, it's bound to not be great. They could do it in so many ways. The easiest most forward approach would just be to allow players to send heirlooms to another server through the mail. <br />
<br />
Another idea was to have a &quot;shared&quot; bank box that would be shared across your entire account. It would be big enough to store all heirlooms plus a few more boa items. This of course is probably a little more complicated. Considering their coding knowledge and crew... it would be a piece of cake to solve. Despite it being the B-team. If they can make a map appear in your hands when you look at the map... they clearly got plenty of time on their hands.</div></div><hr />
