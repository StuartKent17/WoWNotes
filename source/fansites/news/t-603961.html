2.3.2 Patch information<br />
Just a few words to let you know that the 2.3.2 Information Compilation (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=2506.0) has been updated, patch mirrors are now fairly recents and the item changes I posted a week ago have been added as well. <br />
<br />
As a reminder, this patch won't go live until 2008 because of the christmas holidays. (We're not getting any server maintenance this week and the week after anyway)<br />

2.4 and Sunwell information Q&amp;A<br />
Acaciaizm.com (http://acaciaizm.com/?p=313) has been updated about the 2.4 preview (see this news) with a few questions (and answers) from various sources, including this site. (Yay !)<br />
<br />
Here is a short summary :<br />
There wasn't anything said about the &quot;Legendary Hunter Bow&quot;. <br />
No talks about new Badges/Honor/Reputation rewards either, except the new Shattered Sun Offensive faction.<br />
Sets aren't class specifics, but will be tuned to fit specific needs for classes (including a Warrior and a Holy paladin tuned set).<br />
The Daily Quest cap is raised to 25 because Blizzard doesn't really want to limit them anymore and understand that people like to grind money by running daily quests instead of bashing monsters. (Also, keep in mind that the patch will introduce tons of new daily quests to help building/claiming the town in Sunwell)<br />
The design of Magister's Terrace (5-man) is based on Silvermoon City, it will also features the Blood Elve Observatory. <br />
The Sunwell Plateau (5-man) will be a multiple-buildings instance powered by captured Naarus. The last room will contain the Sunwell. <br />
Kael'thas is being reused in the 5-man instance, but might be available only in heroic mode.<br />
Devs want to let more players experience the lore and get the chance to meet characters such as Kael'thas. <br />
Heroic instances requirements (Revered to Honored) have been changed to let new players and alts experience enter them without having to farm normal instances. <br />
For more details, read the much longer article on Acaciaizm.com (http://acaciaizm.com/?p=313)<br />

It's monday, and I think we all know what it means ... Dark Legacy (http://www.darklegacycomics.com/122.html) !<br />

<br />
This is no longer the case in the last PTR build.<br />
<br />
<br />
There wasn't anything said about the &quot;Legendary Hunter Bow&quot;.<br />
<br />
If i'm not mistaken it was only stated &quot;legendary ranged weapon&quot; even if i agree it could be a bow, nothing was discovered/announced yet.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valeea</div><div class="date">2007-12-24, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">when black temple was announced, did one immediately find out about the warglaives? i think not</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FISKER_Q</div><div class="date">2007-12-24, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it would be considered obvious that we would see the warglaives in one form or another, we already knew from datamining that it was there as a weapon, it was just about a time and place to get it.<br />
<br />
What better place to get it than from Illidan in Black Temple?<br />
<br />
If we use the same logic on Sunwell Plateau there's no bosses that would logically wield a bow, and it would be unlikely that any legendary bow would drop there.<br />
<br />
It's possible though, the high elves are known for their archers and rangers, but atleast there's nothing boss-wise to suggest that it would drop from anyone in there, perhaps as a quest รก la Atiesh?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valeea</div><div class="date">2007-12-24, 05:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its also not very &quot;logical&quot; that medivhs staff atiesh was split into 42 parts, of which one dropps by kelthuzad while the other one is dropped by cthun in ahn qiraji. these two have absolutely nothing to do with another, despite the fact that you need both to complete atiesh. i think its useless to talk about logic in terms of storytelling. if they want a legendary bow to drop of anyone in SWP or be a questitem like TF and Atiesh were, they find a way to implement this without any preceding &quot;logic&quot; :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calmred</div><div class="date">2007-12-24, 05:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kil'jaeden will be the final boss of the 25-man instance. The other bosses include Brutalicus, a giant Pit Lord who has lost his wings, Kalecgos, a blue dragon enslaved by Kil'jaeden, a Fel Dragon, the female Eredar Twins, and a Dark Naaru.<br />
<br />
<br />
From that list, the only possibility would be the Eredar Twins. That is if they try and stick to someone that would use the weapon (ala Illidan and the Warglaives) and not Atiesh and the splinters and other pieces.</div></div><hr />

take the dot away from the Quests instead...&lt;,&lt; sorry seen dat early this morning<br />
<br />
and maybe there is a bow already in the game...the S3 bow...u know how they like to reuse items in the game and just recolor things and the look of it looks nice for a legendary item</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">yvanka</div><div class="date">2007-12-25, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't think they'd include Sylvanas or something, do you?<br />
<br />
Heh. We'd have heard something about that, but it's still interesting to speculate. Rangers are an integral part of Elven society; a longbow wouldn't be unusual to see. I just wonder who they'd have drop it. Alleria Windrunnder? Again, a pretty prominent name that I think we'd have heard get dropped by now. Vereesa? Lalala.<br />
<br />
I guess the Eredar twins would make the most sense.</div></div><hr />
