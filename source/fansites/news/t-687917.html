All the classes mentioned in the Upcoming 3.3 balance adjustments (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418853941-upcoming-33-balance-adjustments.html) post from yesterday had their share of extra information today! <br />
Gear Requirements increased for Heroic Halls of Reflection<br />
We recently increased the gear requirement for heroic Halls of Reflection which is probably the issue. I looked at the profile you mentioned and it appears to be really close to meeting the requirements, it will probably take one more upgrade on one of those blues and you would be all set (disclaimer: no guarantees as I can make mistakes). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22418744326-why-can-my-priest-not-queue-for-heroic-hor.html))<br />
<br />
Healing in Icecrown Citadel<br />
Now, healing is going to be tough on some of these encounters. This is not Halls of Stone. If it takes a few weeks to beat some of the Icecrown bosses, that's not the worst thing in the world. You might have to gear up a little or look at your normal healing strategy. We see a lot of the same complaints about Northrend Beasts when that content was new, but of course players figured out how to heal through that too. Just make sure you aren't calling every situation in which your healing is being challenged excessive, unpredictable burst damage on the part of the bosses.

Rogue nerf and consequences<br />
It's amazing how the raiding guilds of the world went from stacking rogues to sitting rogues in one night.<br />
<br />
Most of the estimates I've seen on the forums is around a 7% nerf to Assassination and a 2% nerf to Combat. That sounds about right. If you're arguing your raid can't handle that or offset it in other ways, I'm a tiny bit skeptical.<br />
<br />
I know it's not fun to get nerfed. Believe me. I hear about it. But the whole moral of the &quot;sky is falling&quot; deal is that when you exaggerate the impact of every change we make, then it makes for it hard for us and everyone else to distinguish between things that are really a big deal versus you just venting a little bit. If the sky is falling let us know that, but save it up for those episodes when it really is. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418634040-this-is-my-new-main.html))<br />
<br />
Nerf to Combat rogues<br />
This question keeps coming up despite our making several attempts to answer it, so I'll just sticky it up here. Why did we nerf Combat rogues too?<br />
<br />
We thought Combat damage was too high as well, just not as high as Assassination. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418853941-upcoming-33-balance-adjustments.html))<br />
<br />
Hunger for Blood Nerf<br />
I suspect a lot of this talk is just grumbling over being nerfed in general, but I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is over Hunger for Blood. From a design perspective, it's really nice to have a knob that is so easy to tweak like that. You don't have to go potentially break other talents. You don't have to change base points or coefficients in ways that affect other specs or even lower level members of the class. In fact the mastery system for Cataclysm works somewhat similarly, giving us the ability to adjust numbers independently without causing a cascade of undesirable effects.<br />
<br />
To use a different example, consider Affliction locks. We want to buff their dps as I said, but we want to do it in such a way without giving them a big boost in PvP where they do pretty high damage. We don't want to over buff Destruction or Demonology (because we want Affliction to be a real choice) so we can't easily touch spells that overlap or talents that those other guys might use. If we had an Affliction talent (&quot;Hunger for Green Fire&quot;) that let us easily tweak them up or down, then in turn we could make adjustments more easily and with less risk.<br />
<br />
(Let's not turn this into an Affliction thread. I just wanted to illustrate the contrast between an easy to adjust and hard to adjust tree.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418944030-lol-rogue-hfb-nerf.html))<br />

Tier-10 Elemental Shaman 4-Piece Bonus<br />
In the next minor content patch we're making a change to the tier-10 elemental shaman 4-piece set bonus. In addition to lowering Lava Burst's cooldown, this bonus also no longer requires Flame Shock to be present in order for Lava Burst to be a guaranteed critical strike. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/22418704464-tier10-elemental-shaman-4piece-bonus.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-warlock/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br />
Buff to Warlock's damage - Details<br />
As Ghostcrawler mentioned in the “Balance Adjustments” thread for 3.3, we would like to buff warlock PvE damage for all three talent trees. We have a few changes in mind we can share with you and welcome your feedback. That being said, of course these changes are not yet implemented and are subject to revision or reversal before the next minor patch.<br />
<br />
Affliction: While some warlocks will no doubt disagree, we think the damage output of Affliction in PvP is pretty good. Therefore, we want a buff that will increase sustained damage after a ramp-up period. The specific change we have in mind is to allow Shadow Embrace to stack up to 3 times for a total of a 15% damage bonus. The current healing debuff would change to 10% per stack.<br />
<br />
Demonology: We want to double the damage bonus of Demonic Pact granted the warlock. To avoid making this an all-around buff to raid damage, however, the damage bonus provided to other players would remain unchanged.<br />
<br />
Destruction: We want to double the damage bonus provided by Empowered Imp.<br />
<br />
As a further buff to both Demonology and Affliction, we’re testing out the effects of doubling the damage bonus of Improved Shadow Bolt in the Destruction tree.<br />
<br />
Again, these are preliminary ideas. These changes might be revised or reverted before going live. Just the same, these are not necessarily the only changes we are willing to make and your feedback is appreciated. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418944362-lock-buffs-inc.html)) <br />
<br />
Empowered Imp Buff<br />
The talent would increase the imp's damage by 10/20/30%, up from 5/10/15%. The other effect of the talent would remain unchanged. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418944362-lock-buffs-inc.html))<br />
<br />
Demonic Pact Buff<br />
At top rank, Demonic Pact will provide a base 10% spell damage increase for warlocks. The buff applied to party or raid members remains unchanged. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418944362-lock-buffs-inc.html))<br />
<br />
Changes in the next minor patch<br />
One thing to keep in mind is that these changes are intended to be made in the next minor patch. It's much more risky to make drastic changes in a minor patch when we're concerned with it being released in a very timely manner. We're allowed to experiment more in major content patches when we have more testing time, including by the public.<br />
<br />
Smaller tweaks to particular coefficients are better, more immediate adjustments we can make to improve the performance of a specialization without more drastically altering talent functionality with little testing. Taking that risk tends to lead to bigger adjustments in the other direction in the future, which is almost always perceived very negatively by the community -- as I would assume could be demonstrated by what you've written in quotes. We try to avoid the practice of &quot;the devs giveth and the devs taketh away&quot; whenever possible.<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider is that we're talking about taking steps to keep all three specializations of a pure DPS class viable in PvE, even if it means some of these steps cannot, unfortunately, be taken in the next minor patch. There are other pure DPS classes a lot further away from having three viable PvE specialization choices. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418944362-lock-buffs-inc.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-warrior/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br />
Warbringer changes in 3.3.2<br />
In the next content patch the current plan is to change Warbringer a bit so that it no longer allows Charge and Intercept to break roots or snares but Intervene would remain unaffected.<br />
<br />
We'll see if any further changes come down the pipeline. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/22418633982-what-shall-the-prot-nerf-be.html))<br />
<br />
Potential changes to Shield Slam<br />
We are also considering some changes to Shield Slam to where it won't affect players in normal tanking gear but it will affect the scaling of block value for those who are stacking it. This isn't guaranteed as we still want to make sure it doesn't have a real negative effect on PvE, but in turn we may have the threat caused by Shield Slam just straight increased. We'll see how this goes as we test it internally. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/22418633982-what-shall-the-prot-nerf-be.html))<br />
<br />
Protection warriors in PvP<br />
There are numbers in between 1 and 10. Players have a bad habit of viewing everything in terms of extremes. Yes we want Protection to be viable in PvP and most likely it still will be. Nerfing them because they are overpowered is not the same as them being useless.<br />
<br />
Expecting the forum-visiting WoW community to ever come to a consensus on anything is unrealistic. That said, Protection warriors in PvP wasn't one of the arguments where there were a lot of very passionate souls on both sides. Many players suspected or were outright convinced that Prot was overpowered at worst or at least really frustrating to play against. On the other hand, we've posted several times that if the totality of their beef is just seeing Prot in PvP at all, then they're out of luck.<br />
<br />
These arguments are somewhat similar to those rogues saying &quot;But we're supposed to do high damage&quot; and seeing nothing wrong with being 1000 to 2000 dps higher than others in their group. Yes you're supposed to be in PvP. You're not supposed to own PvP.<br />
<br />
If you're one of those players with no interest in PvP and just don't want to see your tanking potential hurt, then I am slightly more sympathetic, but then again you should know what I'm going to say by now. WoW is a game with PvP and PvE components. Just because one of those isn't of interest to you personally doesn't mean we should neglect it. (And as I've said, we aren't interested in nerfing Prot warriors who are actually tanking.)

I completely understand that they should be above the hybrid classes, but not as far as they were (15-20%).<br />
<br />
This is coming from a (what I consider to be) high end perspective. On a fight like Deathbringer Saurfang I can pull 8.5k dps as a DK (albeit with an ilvl 251 wep) and the 2 rogues we have can do the same as me (guy has slightly worse gear than me) and the other guy is on 10.1-10.5k dps. His gear is slightly better than mine but not THAT much better, even he admitted (grudgingly) that it was quite a bit more than anyone else could possibly pull. A 7% nerf is not the end of the world, they will still top the dps meters, just not by such an absurdly high margin, I'm all for sitting at 2nd place as long as I'm not left in the dirt as I have been for the last few weeks.<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Really? You don't understand this Gc? Rogues dps = other classes dps. Mmk... I really think rogues have been &quot;Sunwelled&quot; in a way. Our guild went and did a raid tonight, instead of pulling the standard three rogues in for the raid, we only pulled one. A combat rogue for Savage Combat. The other rogues were sat because they simply don't provide anything more than another class, especially a ranged class that can get out of the mess that melee has to go into. <br />
<br />
And those early EJ numbers of 7% and 2% are just that, early. From the numbers I put out tonight, compared to the same fight 2 nights ago, I've seen about a %12 reduction.<br />
<br />
And yes, HfB is almost embarrassing to spec into anymore. Especially for a 51pt talent. It's already been said numerous times, but compare HfB to Murder. Not only does it provide similar damage increase, but it doesn't require energy, doesn't require a bleed to be on the target to use, and it doesn't take up a GCD. That's why you're hearing a lot of QQ about HfB. <br />
<br />
And why are you pulling numbers from other forums? Did you guys not do the math yourselves before you pressed the nerf button and just hoped it would be alright?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They take a slight nerf when they are doing 11k + DPS on Saurfang when other people are barely breaking 9-10k, and suddenly they don't bring anything to the raid. Nice.<br />
<br />
Anyone who thinks the nerf was unwarranted is off their rocker, and because Rogues are a &quot;pure&quot; class (which doesn't really exist anymore since all classes bring buffs to the raid), doesn't mean they should be doing 20% more damage than anyone else in the raid, especially for a spec that pushes TWO BUTTONS.</div></div><hr />

Remember that blizz quote a couple days ago that went something like &quot;focus on killing the bosses, not your own teammates&quot;? Well....... seems like a lot of people really just dont go with it. Do you really care that much if you top the meters? Your guild works TOGETHER, as a TEAM, to deffeat a boss. Crying NERF, and TOO OP at a PURE DPS class in pve is not just going to hurt the class that is nerfed. Its going to hurt you too....Rogues bring nothing to the table but dps...it was logical enough to have them top the meters. What they should have done instead of nerfing was make mutilate have a challenging and legit rotation that d require skill for you to top the meters like the rotation we had in the very begining of wotlk. Just my 5 cents.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who thinks the nerf was unwarranted is off their rocker, and because Rogues are a &quot;pure&quot; class (which doesn't really exist anymore since all classes bring buffs to the raid), doesn't mean they should be doing 20% more damage than anyone else in the raid, especially for a spec that pushes TWO BUTTONS.<br />
<br />
<br />
ok, consider this. one class brings no raidbuffs nor debuffs, another class brings buffs or debuffs. both classes do equal dps. which one will you pick?</div></div><hr />

Sure, show me one class that doesn't bring any raid buffs or debuffs. Definitely not Rogues, as they bring Tricks of the Trade, Master Poisoner, Savage Combat.<br />
<br />
This isn't TBC, everyone brings something to the raid.<br />
<br />
People were stacking Rogues because their DPS was broken. Rogue DPS is still the top but they aren't destroying everyone on the meters. If you can't see that Rogues doing 20% more DPS than everyone else was a problem, then there's really no point in arguing with you, but please keep crying. Your tears nourish my cold black heart.</div></div><hr />

When a class/spec does 20% more dmg than the others.. it hurts everyone else.. because everyone else (aside for a few selected few that will come to buff you) will be left outside so the raid can stack rogues and destroy everything.</div></div><hr />

When I heard of the Hunger For Blood Nerf, of course I went haywire cursing Blizzard up and down. But, after I cooled off a bit, I decided to see how bad it actually was. I went from pulling 10,000 DPS in a raid to barely being able to break 8k; this is also 25 man raid buffed. I think this Nerf is absolutely silly. We are a pure DPS class, we have no other specs such as healing or the ability to go ranged. Anyone who plays a DPS class wants to be on top of the meters, and it feels good when you are. And granted, rogues now do bring things to the table like: Trix of the trade, Savage Combat, and Master Poisoner. But, you can get a Hunter for a misdirect, a ret paladin for the same buff as master poisoner, and an arms warrior for the same buff as savage combat. All three of those classes bring more to the table then rogues them self. I agree (on the other hand) that we should have gotten nerfed, but I do feel that it is a little extreme right now. My problem is, Blizzard is basing weather or not to Nerf a class by how well they do in PvP. Last I can remember, World of Warcraft was mainly a PvE environment.</div></div><hr />

Warbringer changes in 3.3.2<br />
In the next content patch the current plan is to change Warbringer a bit so that it no longer allows Charge and Intercept to break roots or snares but Intervene would remain unaffected.<br />
<br />
We'll see if any further changes come down the pipeline. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/22418633982-what-shall-the-prot-nerf-be.html))<br />
<br />
Potential changes to Shield Slam<br />
We are also considering some changes to Shield Slam to where it won't affect players in normal tanking gear but it will affect the scaling of block value for those who are stacking it. This isn't guaranteed as we still want to make sure it doesn't have a real negative effect on PvE, but in turn we may have the threat caused by Shield Slam just straight increased. We'll see how this goes as we test it internally. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/22418633982-what-shall-the-prot-nerf-be.html))<br />
<br />
Yay! PvP nerfs effecting PvE!!! Sure you may not use Warbringer all the time while tanking, but when you do need it, you'll remember when you had it! (Human warriors get a +1 for having EMfH.) Those of you who do regular dungeons wearing block value gear for your friends and for the lulz will now be considered PvP'ers, and all that gear you collected will now be worthless as you won't actually get the block value as listed. Shield slams will now be as effective as a wet noodle hitting the wall. To compensate for this, we have compensated the threat to be equal that of your Mother when she first found your porno collection.<br />
<br />
Extra sorry for any Prot warriors who might be leveling. If your block value exceeds X%*lvl/Cake, you will now be auto-flagged while leveling so vindictive arena players can extract their QQ revenge on you. Just remember, if you weren't stacking a useful stat like that, we wouldn't have to do this to you. Please ignore any other class that stacks a useful stat as they are working as intended, you are not.<br />
<br />
Seriously Blizzard. Isn't it about time you just made a PvP toggle for certain spells? <br />
<br />

Actually it's never been 3 charges. Its always 2. Not too much will really change with this. Instead of charging out of the Roots/Snares, now warriors will just have to Intervene to a teammate in order to charge/intercept. As for mobility, it's one of the signature abilities of the class that have helped it stay competitive with other tanks. It's annoying in a raid to have to ask for BoF when you're watching the pally tank cast it on himself to run about and continue his tanking duties with no problems. But like i said, it's just an additional button that will have to pushed to accomplish what could have been done before with one.<br />
<br />
For the record, i agree that Prot PvP is ridiculous... while wearing PvE gear. You don't get nearly as much Block Value while wearing PvP gear, and it's just another fault of blizzard for not making resilience a much more desired stat than it has been, currently is, or will be. The fact you fail to see how PvE warriors like me are saddened to a degree about the mere mentioning of these nerfs shows how entrenched you yourself are in PvP. Hence your QQ has lead to Prot QQ, so you have no grounds to tell them to stuff it.</div></div><hr />

However, being a mostly PvE shaman, this just reinforces the fact that I'm not going to be aiming for the 4p. If their intention was to help our dps on adds or so that we dont clip some of our spells, they really dont have a clue as to what to do with a crappy set bonus that they've dug themselves into a hole with. With the way things are going with this spec atm, it's a wonder why people play this spec anymore when their buffs can be gained from other classes.

I agree their dmg can be OP against some classes/lower geared people, but most classes were still able to beat prot warrs if they had just sóme skill/gear: ret's, dk's, feral druids, hunters, healers etc etc.. the only real classes that dont stand a real chance are rogues and locks (tho locks stand a better chance then rogues). I think blizz should just nerf the dmg abit, like.. reduce the +%crit chance on shield slam/devastate/heroic strike from talents, instead of removing the only real strength of the pvp-prot.. Warbringer. With that talent removed, the entire idea of the prot warr is gone.. what 'extra' will you have compared to arms warrs? last stand? 'yay'.

Remember that blizz quote a couple days ago that went something like &quot;focus on killing the bosses, not your own teammates&quot;? Well....... seems like a lot of people really just dont go with it. Do you really care that much if you top the meters? Your guild works TOGETHER, as a TEAM, to deffeat a boss. Crying NERF, and TOO OP at a PURE DPS class in pve is not just going to hurt the class that is nerfed. Its going to hurt you too....Rogues bring nothing to the table but dps...it was logical enough to have them top the meters. What they should have done instead of nerfing was make mutilate have a challenging and legit rotation that d require skill for you to top the meters like the rotation we had in the very begining of wotlk. Just my 5 cents.<br />
<br />
<br />
They should have the tools in the class to, with skill, be top dps. Not to faceroll 2 buttons and be top dps by a stupid margin without even have better gear than the rest of the raid. That's all.<br />
<br />
And the excuse of &quot;then you'll all suffer in the boss encounter now!&quot; is lame. They showed it alread that they tune a boss considering those numbers and find later that those numbers for class X or Y where wrong, they will adjust the encounters for that change (FoK+Yogg?).</div></div><hr />

The most stupid thing the devs did this round was announcing the buffs before hand. Then all the locks go; &quot;Buffs!?, BUFFS!!!, and gets sweat dreams of all the good they gonna get.<br />
If, without mentioning anything first, they had announced a 15% buff to imp, sp buff to Demon and Afflication, ppl would take the buffs as buffs, not this, appereantly, huge dissapointment...</div></div><hr />

It's amazing how the raiding guilds of the world went from stacking rogues to sitting rogues in one night.<br />
<br />
Most of the estimates I've seen on the forums is around a 7% nerf to Assassination and a 2% nerf to Combat. That sounds about right. If you're arguing your raid can't handle that or offset it in other ways, I'm a tiny bit skeptical.<br />
<br />
I know it's not fun to get nerfed. Believe me. I hear about it. But the whole moral of the &quot;sky is falling&quot; deal is that when you exaggerate the impact of every change we make, then it makes for it hard for us and everyone else to distinguish between things that are really a big deal versus you just venting a little bit. If the sky is falling let us know that, but save it up for those episodes when it really is. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418634040-this-is-my-new-main.html))<br />

Well the problem was, rogues doing 10k+ DPS on bosses, but as you can see, other classes can aswell if you go further in.. So instead of QQing people maybee should have a look on their DPS rotation/Gemming/Spec etc. instead.</div></div><hr />

Yes because all the buffs we bring are easily overwritten by any other classes' equivalent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll see if any further changes come down the pipeline.&quot;<br />
<br />
i would be willing to make the sacrifice of warbringer not breaking roots, and snare's if the talent reduced the cool down of charge/intercept by 50%. or better yet, keep the mechanic of the warbringer talent breaking roots, and snare's but increase the cooldown by 50%. (30 second cooldown instead of 15 seconds).<br />
<br />
that way the cry baby ranged classes can still kite us a little bit, but no so much that we are a free kill.</div></div><hr />

Did you even look at what i just posted? 11 pages of complete domination on single target boss fights and 12-13k dps ontop of that. There's one warlock on the first page, but his total damage done is 806k so going to ignore that, same with the mage on the 3rd page, not entire fight. Then there is a smatter of a few people doing around 10-11k who aren't rogues, there is no denying it muti rogues were op and combat rogues to a smaller extent, it's more of a normalisation not a downright nerf.</div></div><hr />

That 5% does not add t your SP but your Spell Damage done with each spell cast. So no, It won't add to your raid members. The 10% is still 10% of your SP added to raid. Not your Spell Damage. Diffrent type of buff.</div></div><hr />

One thing I find interesting about these reports, that I haven't seen anyone else point out, is the fact that all these top rogues have another rogue in their raid. I haven't found any top rogues where there was only one rogue in the raid (like is common in 10 mans). To me, the issue isn't rogue base abilities or poisons, it's rogues TOT'ing each other. A 15% damage increase every 30 seconds, for 10 secs, seems to fit almost exactly the amount rogues are going above other DPS.<br />
<br />
So my question is, why nerf combat and assassination so much instead of just changing tot to not be usable on other rogues? This nerf hit 10 man rogues much harder than any other. Not only do we lose 7-10% we also aren't getting tricks from another rogue, so it's really a 25% hit compared to 25 man rogues.<br />
<br />
Just a thought that I haven't seen anyone else mention .</div></div><hr />

It's much easier to dial down a flat damage increase talent and a coefficient of a high % of our damage than to start putting exceptions in spells, if they kept doing that then spells would get over complicated and they have already said they wanted to digress away from that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this does not nerv pve and ppl do not have to be afraid of chain-charge??? oO<br />
<br />
the ony ones who profit of this change are mages (who are op against warriors anyway) and druids... all the other classes kite us through slows and they get no help out of the planed change and will just cry for more nerfs. <br />
<br />
^this could be utter bullshit, as i have not done anything else then tank on my warrior for a looooooong time, but if not: could someone plx post this on the english forums (i'm from eu and i do not feel like anyone important reads german eu forums)<br />
<br />
also: on the shild slam change: why don't they make some of the gear-changes planed for cata a little early and just take away all the BV from the gear (i think nearly no prot warrior will cry about this because a)trash is srs bzns and b) there is nearly no BV on all the new ICC gear anyway...)<br />
<br />
in my oppinion all the ToC i didn't even want to weare (i just don't like block) is to blame for the warrior nerfs we face now... well blizz is so intelligent... they nerf an entire class because of 1 tier they just fail-designed because one fucking designer had the brilliant idea to bring back BV before they remove it in cata (they allready nearly removed it on ICC). in fact it just came back with the &quot;your gear should not be perfect&quot;-philosophy... and now apparently ruins pvp to an extent where it has to be balanced in a patch... i mean how much more fail can you get? gear that &quot;should not be desireable&quot; over other gear of the same ilvl now ruins a part of the game and to counteract it they ruin another part of the game instead of fixing the problem where it came from...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The reason rogues trick each other is because of how low our threat coefficient is and our extensive selection of threat reduction and removal abilities, also if timed properly it can be to a devastating effect, if you want to be seeing spells like:<br />
<br />
Tricks of the Trade<br />
15 Energy	20 yd range<br />
Instant	30 sec cooldown<br />
The current party or raid member becomes the target of your Tricks of the Trade unless it is a Rogue / Retribution Pala / Hunter. The threat caused by your next damaging attack and all actions taken for 6 sec afterwards will be transferred to the target unless they have an average gear score of over 258. In addition, all damage caused by the target is increased by 15% during this time.<br />
<br />
then it's going to start getting very messy, it's much easier to dial down a static damage buffing ability / talent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
For somebody who has played rogue for 4 years you seem pretty clueless, they buffed poisons earlier in Wotlk they are just finding a way to affect the combat spec, ~7.5% nerf to somebody doing 11k dps is 10125 dps remaining, must be tough to be you. Also, don't forget rogues are one of the classes that scale the best.<br />

We've addressed this issue already recently, but if you need to hear more on the topic:<br />
<br />
1) Prot warriors aren't exactly dominating Arena play by almost any stretch.<br />

2) Yes, there are some good Prot warriors. There are many more good mages and rogues.<br />

Requires a bleed effect to be active on the target.<br />
Last 1 minute, but who cares? You wasted a talent point on this!<br />

Yeah, DKs are really in the same league... NOT!<br />
<br />
On a more serious note... I would say DKs don't exactly need traditional nerfing, I think they need balancing. But, basically, the whole game could do with a good balancing run. It's gotten out of hand, all of it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gogetaex</div><div class="date">2010-01-10, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the problem was, rogues doing 10k+ DPS on bosses, but as you can see, other classes can aswell if you go further in.. So instead of QQing people maybee should have a look on their DPS rotation/Gemming/Spec etc. instead. <br />
<br />
....Errr... the problem was rogues were doing ALL the DPS, I went in several pages and saw THREE non rogues.</div></div><hr />

Yet now, in order to fix one, you gotta nerf the other in the process. What stupidity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then they will be nerfing festergut, because if they nerf DKs or other dps class more... it wont be easy for average guilds(ToGC 4/5 or ToGC 5/5 25times) to beat the 5 min enrage.</div></div><hr />

Often one lock does 15% more crits on his attacks than another one with both having the same % of crits in their stats :-\</div></div><hr />

Warbringer. i dont PvP its dumb and no one can touch the the 50k i rock in BG's and its just not fun. i use that for when stupid stuff in the dungeons roots me or im slowed and the target runs away. real fair to be stuck for how ever long the debuff is while getting hammered by things. mmmmmmmmmmmmm i love you blizzard. . .having my mobility nurfed in raids going to make people really frustrated, but then again who already isnt ?</div></div><hr />
