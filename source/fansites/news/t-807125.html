We recently made a change to the way experience is calculated and wanted to take some time to explain this change in order to clear up some confusion some may be having in regard to their rate of progress. If you are currently at the maximum level that you can be for an expansion (or higher), killing creatures from that expansion will now grant 10% of normal experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
Level 60 or higher players get 10% normal experience for killing creatures in Azeroth (“Old world” content)<br />
Level 70 or higher players get 10% of normal experience for killing Burning Crusade creatures.<br />
Level 80 or higher players get 10% of normal experience for killing Lich King creatures.<br />
Level 85 or higher players get 10% of normal experience for killing Cataclysm creatures.<br />
<br />
<br />
What does this mean for those that have Cataclysm and are leveling up new characters? This means that you will gain normal experience through to level 60 and will then need to move on to The Burning Crusade zones until you reach level 70 and Wrath of the Lich King zones until you reach level 80. Once you reach 80, it is expected that you will be continuing your leveling adventures in the new Cataclysm zones and dungeons. We have made this change so that players will continue to progress through the appropriate content for their level versus grinding on quick re spawns in a less ideal location.<br />
<br />
This change will also affect hunter pets and their leveling rate if the player is at max level, however, this is an unintended change that we will be addressing in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What it means is that at 60 you have to move to Outland to continue getting exp from mobs at a normal rate, at 70 you have to move to Northrend, and at 80 you have to move to Cataclysm zones. You are able to leave for the expansion areas two levels early, say at 58 and 68 if you wish, but Cataclysm zones will not offer quests until 80. So you have to stay in Northrend until 80.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This means that when you hit 60+, all old-world mobs will give 10% of the experience they normally would if you were at that level. At 70+, all outland creatures will give 10% of their normal xp. At 80+, all northrend creatures will give 10% of their normal xp. And at 85+, all cataclysm mobs will give 10% normal xp.<br />
<br />
This is basically to prevent people from using old content to level. Like, if you were 80, it prevents you from going to old instances to level to 83 and get a jump on everyone else.</div></div><hr />

Wait, how player 85 getting 10% from monsters makes sense? They don't get ANY experience, and that thing serves only the sadistic desire of screwing up hunters developers have.<br />
If people can't go over 85, there is no need to make cataclysm monsters give 10%. WTG Blizz, now hunter pets are stuck in 82 for no reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not exactly.. you used to leave 2 levels prior to maxing our your character on said content (58 for the Dark Portal, 68 for Northrend)... Now you actually have to stay in your content for the whole haul that an 'expansion' of WoW would carry you, assuming as if you didn't have the next content expansion yet...</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, this means that you DON'T want to stay in azeroth once you hit 60, you DON'T want to stay in outlands when you hit 70, and you DON'T want to stay in northrend once you hit 80. Essentially it is saying that once you outlevel the content, you should move on. You can still go to outlands at 58, northrend at 68, and potentially cataclysm zones once you hit 78 (although I do not know what level the mobs and quests are, so this might not be ideal).<br />

<br />
Its referring mob xp, not quest xp. So you could still hand in a bunch of quests or continue questing. However the quest xp reward is much greater for the new expansions over the old anyway.</div></div><hr />

Oh well.<br />
<br />
The way I see it.. you just get kicked out of the zone, basically.. Doesn't seem like you can't go to Wrath at 68 or BC at 58. Basically not changing anything for anyone who is interested in leveling quickly.<br />
<br />
I got my dwarf shaman to 80 on the 4th ;P 3 days, 19hrs game time Haha, but sort of able to just glide through everything.. And if you've done BC 9-10 times, you would have done old world an equal amount if not more, probably more due to alts that you got midway to 60 and put away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you can still leave at 58/58/78 respectively. It only prevents you from going backward not forward.</div></div><hr />

i wouldnt say it means you 'have' to stay there. but the xp will be significantly less if you stay in old zones (like you'd want to?). its just making it obvious that you need to progress to the next load of content.</div></div><hr />

Of course, why hunter pets have to level is beyond me. No other pet class has that problem, and honestly, why make us grind out 3 levels? It's not a challenge, it's not fun, and no one that I know of likes it.</div></div><hr />

I thought the general population of MMO-Champion was supposed to be smarter and more informed than the general WoW population? The above quote is false. You do not HAVE to stay in the zones until 60/70/80, you can leave at 58/68/78, like the previous expansions.

1) This change ONLY affects mobs, NOT quest XP. Since quest XP is a huge bulk of XP gain, there is no issue and questers will see very little change.<br />
2) This change was made for one reason alone: people who were planning on grinding Wrath heroics to 85 or any mob in wrath. This forces everyone to the new content, and a level playing field<br />
3) The minimum level is 58 for BC, 68 for Wrath, 80 for Cata. All quests listed on the Vashj'ir and Hyjal pages, when clicked say &quot;Requires Level 80&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Krab<br />
<br />
It'll be 80 for Cataclysm stuff. You can NOT do the 80 - 85 zones as a 78. You don't get any quests until 80.</div></div><hr />

The above quote is false. You do not HAVE to stay in the zones until 60/70/80, you can leave at 58/68/78, like the previous expansions. As the blue post stated, this change was only made so you would go out and experience new content, not farm old mobs/content to level.<br />
<br />
And this post is incorrect. 0 cataclysm content until 80 this time, not 2 levels prior (78)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This change is not forcing you to stay in old zones til 60, 70, and 80. It's encouraging you to get the hell out of old zones so you can continue to level quickly.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like the shiny new World realy catches on, if Blizzard is in the need of forcing the player into it at any cost ( Remove Portals, Reduce XP Gain in Old World ). Glad i dont play this game anymore, what a Mockery.</div></div><hr />

It means that you will gain 10% of normal experience gained in azeroth when you are lvl 60 or more, 10% of normal experience gained in outlands when you are lvl 70 or more and so on :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. I actually did level one of my characters from 70 to 73 by doing lots of TBC heroics. Not because it was really faster exp/hour than doing the bread crumb quests in Northrend, but because it was another way to level an alt.<br />
<br />
They could give 75% exp at level x1, 50% exp at level x2, 25% exp at level x3, but not just drastically reduce it to the ground at level x0. There are many ways to stop people getting realm firsts by chainrunning WotKL heroics till 85...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I shouldn't be penalized for wanting to finish every quest I have. I shouldn't hit 60, 70, or 80 and drop every quest I have, shit my pants, and run as fast as possible to the next expansion. Logically, they should WANT us to experience every quest, every zone, and stay in an old expansion as long as possible, because the timeline of logic says we'll then spend more time on, and getting to each other patch, meaning longer sub times, etc...<br />
<br />
So, this SHOULD be changed back in the first Cata content patch and they should stop trying to turn into Nazi-Blizzard, forcing us to do what they want us to do. I think the change was just for all the people who thought they were beating the system getting the best dailys to turn in on release-day.</div></div><hr />

If I get 10% on mob kills once I hit 61, who cares? If I want to stay in Azeroth and finish all the quests, then I will. Is the 10% really bothering most of you that much? Some of you stated that staying behind had nothing to do with experience gain, but questing. Well thats great, it shouldn't matter, continue to quest. Remember, even green mobs granted less experience than yellow mobs. It was always based on your level in relation to the enemy mob. And besides, once they turned grey you were out all experience anyway. Are the people who comment like this the ones that don't try to achieve things like Loremaster? Once you hit 85, you won't care anymore.</div></div><hr />

What I don't understand is why people freak out about someone else's realm first and the way it is obtained.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I get 10% on mob kills once I hit 61, who cares?<br />
<br />
So I should be penalized (even beyond expansion experience inflation) because there are folks rushing things out?<br />
<br />
p.s. Once you hit 60.<br />
<br />
<br />
Expect to be penalized while:<br />
-using Dungeon finder<br />
-catching up profesions<br />
-finishing interesting Q lines &amp; zones<br />
-...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greylocke</div><div class="date">2010-12-07, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Who's freaking out? You took that into a direction I wasn't even headed. If you're rushing to do realm firsts, you're not going to stick in old world content grinding out mob kills. Read the vast amount of replies before yours on how members were upset that they couldn't quest in Azeroth once hitting 60. If anything, I was trying to bring some level-headed thinking into this topic. If you not up for the achievements or playing casually, its not really all that big a deal. And all these rushers, are in Cata grinding out higher level mobs anyway. <br />
<br />
As far as the second comment, I guess its everyone's own opinion on what they consider fun. If they reduce the experience to 10%, I guess some don't have fun when they're affected. Penalized or not, if you aren't rushing content for Realm First achievements, then why would you think this is less fun. I'm not going to let this tell me how to have fun. I'm going to do what I want, and I'm going to enjoy doing it. You're not penalized for doing lower level quests, and you're not penalized for catching up on professions. The same limitations you had for professions and quests at 80 are still there at 85, and its not stated that its changed. Just mob kills, which people probably won't be killing boars, skeletons, or skeleton boars or whatever over and over again until 85. As for Dungeon Finder, when you hit 80, you can start queuing for Cataclysm dungeons.</div></div><hr />

^ this. I'm not sure how much this will actually slow down leveling in old world post-60, but it's a shame that my level 60 warrior (leveled 1-60 in the awesome new content) has to give up on his current quests and go into the [now] oldest content in the game just because the devs think I should.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And therefore hurting people that wish to do some mob grinding for a change? That's been a staple leveling method in other MMOs, and although not the primary way to do so in WoW, it did work prior to this change.</div></div><hr />

Apparently Blizzard is, thus this change.<br />
<br />
<br />
You took that into a direction I wasn't even headed.<br />
<br />
You too.<br />
I tried to say there are people who feel negatively effected and therefore help/harm analysis shoud be done before implementation.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What is the purpose of this change?<br />
To discourage people from some behavior. (I have difficulties to see why is that behavior such big problem in the first place.)<br />
<br />
Do some people feel collateraly damaged by it?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Is consequent good from this change greater than bad?<br />
Me personally woud say no - it is greatly restricting possible ways of leveling - leading to less player choices - less fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Question is not if we can live with it, because we can, even with great chunk of displeasure.<br />
<br />
Question is, is it justified?</div></div><hr />

And honestly I know that some people will want to get the quest achieves and that is understandable, and I guess that does suck alittle for them but its really to ensure content flow with the level range and I like that<br />
<br />
Exactly why did Blizzard feel the need to enforce their view of how to play the game on everyone? This is not an exploit and players were already punished because 'old' mobs and quests give less experience and inferior gear rewards.<br />
<br />
This is one of those Blizzard-knows-best solution looking for a problem.</div></div><hr />
