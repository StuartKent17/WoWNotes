<br />
World of Warcraft: Q &amp; A<br />
<br />
Moments of player agency can only happen if there are repercussions. The Saurfang quest in 8.1 is a bit of an experiment in player agency. They want to avoid senseless choices like &quot;should i collect these pumpkins? but emphasize major choices in the future.<br />
Chris Metzen is the next to ask a question!<br />
There may very well be a job posting in the future for a new warchief of the Horde, and if there is, they will call Chris Metzen! Translation - Thrall may have a part to play in the future, though the answer could have just been a joke!<br />
There is a fundamental rewrite of the code for the Auction House that is actively being worked on. When it is implemented, the band aid fix of the 20% Auction House cut will not be needed.<br />
Items collected in Classic will not transfer over to Modern WoW.<br />
The art team is still actively working on adding class cosmetics items, mostly infused in the Heritage Armor.<br />
The team is not satisfied with what leveling has turned into, especially at high level. They agree that something needs to change and are actively working on ways to improve leveling.<br />
Ion is not sure how a level squish would turn out psychologically and would like to hear feedback.<br />
The team has taken a lot of steps to be more aggressive against toxicity in chat. They plan to introduce some of the technology used in other Blizzard games to address toxicity faster.<br />
The team is trying to strike a balance between deterministic goals and RNG. Ion acknowledges that the RNG has gone too far. Going forward, they are introducing some vendors and trying to implement more deterministic methods of obtaining important gear.<br />
The team has discussed improving bad luck protection and streak breaking (getting multiples of the same item) especially in weekly caches.<br />
The team plans to continue to retire bad Azerite traits and add new ones to give more player choice. They also want to add more depth to the Heart of Azeroth necklace.<br />
The team is pretty satisfied with the offensive portion of the global cooldown changes. They want to avoid macroing a bunch of abilities into one key and better design specs around these abilities.<br />
Movement abilities such as Heroic Leap are being taken off the global cooldown in 8.1.<br />
Dying armor is basically tinting, and it works against what the art team creates in terms of gear. Colors add depth to the world.<br />
The team is not against bringing back some utility and abilities that have been lost if it makes sense. They want to continue to iterate on class strengths and weaknesses over homogenizing classes.<br />
The WoW: Classic Demo has sharding because everyone is starting a character in the same spot and they wanted the demo to run smoothly.<br />
They might use sharding in VERY limited ways for WoW: Classic to address launch day problems, but not for the long run once communities and populations stabilize.<br />
Alex will cover all of Azshara in Gallywix's Pleasure Palace once the team allows him to do so.<br />
Why have a giant cannon and never fire it (Gallywix's)? Alex says the cannon will be fired.<br />
Armor type transmog restrictions are in place because of class identity. The restrictions have been loosened a little bit with items such as Heritage Armor that can be worn by any class.<br />
You will be able to transmog over fist weapons with an array of one handed weapons in 8.1<br />
Wands will still not be able to be transmogged over because they are unique and do ranged damage.<br />
The story for Battle for Azeroth is far from over. Alex says if he was Sylvanas he would think Garrosh was an amateur.<br />
There are no plans to activate PvP talents in Island Expeditions.<br />
As of now they plan to have PvP talents work in the future battlegrounds that pit you vs AI.<br />
8.1 will add an account bound item that unlocks all flight paths in the new continents.<br />
Mythic + Progression will be added to the armory panel in 8.1, showcasing your highest key for the week.<br />
It is entirely justified to blame Blizzard when a class gets the reputation for being bad, and they want to address these bad reputations. However, community perspective is often increased when players of a class constantly speak negatively of themselves.<br />
It is likely that class themed armor will return in the future, but for the time being they want to continue to create more armor appearances based on where it is obtained.<br />
The team plans to update WoW: Classic alongside the Modern game. They can't confirm if WoW: Classic will get expansion launches but will continue to ask for community feedback.</div></div><hr />

Im more annoyed with WTBGold wasting a 'question slot' on something that has been known ever since they changed it.<br />

Verrrrrry interesting, this. <br />
<br />
I'd love to know what's going on behind the scenes. My feeling is, in his first foray as lead on WoW, Ion fucked up, and fucked up hard, and it's being addressed, and he's having to admit that either A. he signed off on garbage, or B. he didn't have control over the team and that led to the disarray that the game is in. If RNG went too far...why? Ion said in his AMA on Reddit he takes full responsibility for anything in WoW, is this a begrudging admission that he fucked up, big time?<br />
<br />
Holinka coming back says to me, orders from the top came down, fix this game, NOW. <br />
<br />
But, speculation, speculation, speculation. <br />

The best part of reading the Q&amp;A session is that Blizzard is working to get WOW back to a good place. It will take a while since these are not trivial issues to address. Fingers crossed that it goes well :)</div></div><hr />

Right? Who the heck even cares about Gallywix? He was never meant to be taken seriously, he is just a one-dimensional villain for comic relief. Some characters were not created to be serious and complex.<br />

They don't want it to fail, they want to deliver what fanbase thought it wanted, don't u remember? U think u do, but u don't.<br />

<br />
When did anyone say that Classic would tie into retail in any way? Where did this expectation come from? They (Blizzard) have always couched Classic in terms of saving their legacy in working condition, and there were enough players who wanted the nostalgia to put the dev time in for. It was never expected to be an alternate form of leveling, or part of retail - or a replacement for retail. <br />
<br />
The expectations of Classic across the board are so unrealistic, overhyped and demanding, it really makes me question the sanity of a lot of WoW players. <br />
<br />
And, don't accuse me of being anti-Classic, I have no problems with it existing, I think it's great it's part of the sub, and that they're staging progression with the raids. But the expectations for it...wow. What the actual fuck.</div></div><hr />

Maybe that particular model wasn't involved in the quests? Maybe they wanted to keep the old model for players who liked that - the same reason many rare spawns retain old models for players who want the choice.

Why the hell would anything you collect in classic transfer to modern? Why would anyone think this would be possible? I don't see how that could be within the realm of possibility.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they wanted to keep the old model for players who liked that - the same reason many rare spawns retain old models for players who want the choice. I'm just saying, wanting items from classic to carry to live is dumb and really entitled.<br />
<br />
It is dumb. Didn't say I want that or expected that. I knew at the first announcement of classic that this isn't going to happen. The model didn't get an update due to some quests in Silithus. There was no need to update the mount model but there was a specific reason. They could have easily updated the archaeology model, too. You just said yourself maybe they wanted to keep the old model for players who liked that. The Scarab Lord mount is older and therefore shouldn't have been changed.</div></div><hr />

They're gating the raid releases as a progression, so...could be. They're obviously in wait-and-see mode to see how populated the servers are.<br />

You said how, not why.<br />
<br />
I could easily see that option increasing the overall population of classic players (and because it's one way it wouldn't affect classic) but I guess some would prefer smaller realm populations when players who just tried it (ie. those who weren't around for classic) don't like the grind and then leave, leaving the populations down. Also depends on how many servers they think they'll need. MMOs have a habit of over doing initial servers and then those servers lose too many players when the novelty wears off.<br />

They created the special rule for artifacts because in Legion what artifact you used was tied to your spec, not your weapon specializations.

Really, they need to drop almost all of the restrictions. It's dumb and the rules are completely arbitrary. It's not like seeing a mage having a staff vs. having a sword in PvP is going to change how to approach/attack them or whatever. I can understand the wand restriction, but it's still lame.

I get that. But my question is, so why does it not work for other non-artifact weapons? Just because they switch off all their concerns when it comes to artifacts? Why can't they switch off their concerns for other weapons, then?<br />
<br />
Actually they did specifically address that in the Q&amp;A and said the limitations for wands were a bit trickier because they have a ranged attack with a unique animation that wouldn't work well when translating to a melee weapon type, including artifacts.<br />
BUT YOU CAN LITERALLY DO IT, RIGHT NOW.<br />
<br />
That's my point. It's not an issue of &quot;we can't do it&quot;, because it's already possible. They seem to have some unspoken objection that they aren't expressing, but are apparently okay with foregoing when it comes to artifacts.<br />
<br />
However, the Legion artifacts have no functional component to them anymore, they're LITERALLY purely cosmetic at this point. So why is it okay for these cosmetic items to ignore the rules, but every other, also purely cosmetic item somehow can't be allowed to do the same?<br />

Hey mascotte, I submitted about 15-20 questions. The way it works is, you submit questions the day before, they review everything with all the devs, and then determine what everyone will talk about and in what order. They then rewrite the question and give you a text saying you were selected. Wish one of the hardest questions was picked but this was essentially important general info they chose to reinforce.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt they're changing much about the loot system. Relinquished vendors and a way to target Azerite. Things like TF are way too pooult with their casual base for then to get rid of, so if that was a deal breaker for you don't plan on any sort of comeback. <br />
<br />
I know that if they ruin things for the casuals that's going to have a negative impact on those of us that raid Mythic and I'd rather quit than deal with that shitshow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course the few things they mentioned are on the root of the cancer that's rotting wow right now. But at least they're starting to treat it.<br />
<br />
It's definitely too late for me (and many of the players that abandoned ship, i can't be the only one who feels like this, can i?).<br />
<br />
But i hope for the people (like you, i suppose?) that still float with the raft that they lead you to shore with their choices and not drop you on a barren rock in the middle of the sea, claiming &quot;but it's solid! It's land!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
What? <br />
<br />
Umm.... just make all the gear in the variety of colors that equal the dye. Hell, we get armor in multiple colors anyway... Why not just let the players pick the color...<br />
<br />
Other games did that and 90% of people are running around in black while 5% are in pink or Yellow. It's really not that great in my experience...</div></div><hr />

Wait what ?? Didn't Blizz screw &quot;Class identity&quot; by a royal mile when they made the &quot;Bring the player not the class&quot; thingy ?? And actually made most classes a lot more homogenic ??</div></div><hr />

- already announced before, but the reference that an account-bound item will learn all flightpaths for alts (thank the titans, elune, the loa, and all the other existing gods in the warcraft universe)<br />

The rest... forgetable as usual. So many good questions made by wow fans and ignored as usual.<br />

Pretty much. <br />

<br />
Thank god. I'm so sick of the unimaginative idiots spamming about how Sylvanas is Garrosh 2.0 because they aren't creative enough to think of ANY OTHER possible way Sylvanas' arc could end except to pull very basic comparisons and conclude it as &quot;she bad, she controlled by &lt;insert cursed item here&gt;, we gonna kill her cuz she evil, just like Garrosh.&quot; Sylvanas is a mastermind schemer. She's been plotting this crap for years. I hate her as a person, but she's a great character and I can't wait till she's #NotMyWarchief anymore. I'm sure it's gonna be great.</div></div><hr />

dranlord They can still do the same. Just designate the big, one color areas as &quot;custom color&quot; areas.<br />
<br />
As for people that are confused about the classic thing ... well I didn't expect it but if it's WoW and you're paying for it by using your regular subscription would should it not carry over if you manage to be the scarab lord in 2020? An alternative scenario would be that they're just doing wow waves now. So with the next &quot;current&quot; WoW expansion TBC gets to classic and a new classic instance is being spun up. So you would be able to &quot;experience&quot; all WoW has to offer with a decade difference or so.</div></div><hr />

They don't have to squish levels to make leveling faster. Just make each level require less xp, increase quest xp, etc. I think losing our levels would feel terrible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not about the speed. The speed is fine. It's the fact that over 120 levels you get to make 7 talent choices (+ 3 pvp if you have WM on) and there's no feeling of progression because everything scales with your level now. Level squish, to me, has nothing to do with the speed. It just doesn't feel good now</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc79972df15a</div><div class="date">2018-11-06, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;You get an ability every level as we decreased the level cap to 4 levels. Gaining one level will take you as long as it took you to gain 40 levels before!&quot;<br />
<br />
That approach doesn't work, it would feel like shit. If you adjust the level cap you also have to adjust the leveling speed. Otherwise it's just going to feel tedious. Obviously having more abilities that gradually unlock would let you feel a sense of progression but all those abilities were pruned and won't be coming back except if they can turn them into a gimmick or let them replace a current talent. The easiest way they have would be to decrease the time it takes to gain a level. The problem is that this would make gaining levels feel even more shallow. Combine it with a squish and it might feel better for a new player as he would be gaining something every level but for veterans it would still feel bad.<br />
<br />
As mentioned the problem is that gaining a talent or ability to show you some progress, aside from stats that just exist, are scarce and the scaling nature of the world means that your passive stat gains won't be noticeable for most of the game with the exception of hitting &quot;expansion borders&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Yes, that would have been the only reason 90% of players would want to play it.</div></div><hr />
