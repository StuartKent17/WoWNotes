<br />
WoW Classic Character Limit<br />
How many characters can we create in Classic?<br />
<br />
In WoW Classic, you’ll have the following character limits per WoW account:<br />
<br />
A maximum of 10 characters per WoW Classic realm<br />
A maximum of 50 characters across all of the WoW Classic realms in your region<br />
Only one faction per realm on PvP realms<br />
No overlap or regard with the character limits in Battle for Azeroth<br />
<br />
<br />
You’ll be able to have up to 50 Battle for Azeroth characters and up to 50 WoW Classic characters at the same time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Soul Cleave Thoughts<br />
We’re testing an increase to Soul Cleave damage in the Rise of Azshara PTR, and we haven’t yet fully written developers’ notes on it. I want to give a little context for it, since this is an issue that relates to many class changes.<br />
<br />
A common reaction to buffing a certain spell or talent is “you’re buffing something we don’t use much.” That is, when if we buff a talent that’s not the “best” or buff an ability that’s currently a small part of the rotation, it’s not a large increase to total damage. Sometimes the goal of a buff is to increase the total DPS of a spec, and sometimes it’s to better internally balance something about the rotation or talents. In the former case, we usually buff a slate of prominent spells. In the latter, by definition, we’re buffing something that’s not being used heavily or is being eclipsed by other spells.<br />
<br />
Currently, Spirit Bomb is very popular and causes a rotation where you want to consume nearly every Fragment with Spirit Bomb rather than in any other way. This pushes Soul Cleave pretty far down in value. This is an issue with Spirit Bomb as a talent, but our intent isn’t to upend this commonly-used playstyle right now. A buff to Soul Cleave makes the button compete a little better in between Spirit Bombs, even at the cost of consuming some Fragments that otherwise would have gone into Spirit Bomb. It’s also a side benefit that this is a straightforward buff for people playing talents other than Spirit Bomb.</div></div><hr />

Gee I wonder why.....<br />
<br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard plans to increase investment in their biggest internal franchises.<br />
<br />
So basically you are gonna just push the ones making profit and leave the ones like Starcraft to wither and die? Gotcha.<br />
<br />
<br />
They will continue investing in platform expansion on PC and mobile and new geographies.<br />
<br />
Absolutely fine. And smart business wise. Just don't announce your mobile stuff at Blizzcon again and save it for smaller events like Pax, Gamescom and whatnot.</div></div><hr />

It will. They will chase whatever the current fad is although again they would be quite late to the BR genre and they are gonna be doubling down hard on mobile especially when they've put their best devs (my condolences) on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably a fair amount of refugees from their IPs they announced they're abandoning, like Hearthstone, HotS, and Diablo. They'll make some of that back up for a bit after Diablo Immortal launches in china, but that won't last with the way mobile gamers hope from game to game.</div></div><hr />

They are doing that in the cheap way <br />
-mobile diablo game<br />
-Wow: classic<br />
-Warcraft 3: remastered <br />
<br />
All of these will increase MAUs by a respectable margin.</div></div><hr />

Activision is a separate number. The 32 is just Blizzard titles, but I wouldn't be surprised if a lot were from hearthstone.</div></div><hr />

sheeeeyit. well then yeah if overwatch is 'stable' then its hearthstone and WoW. All their other games are dead and dead games dont decline in user numbers in the millions.</div></div><hr />

This is the only thing we are going to get in 2019. Dont have my hopes high for 2020 either. Probably some more mobile shite and ofc a wow xpac. <br />

Beyond that, I doubt Blizzard will give us something huge.</div></div><hr />

Wow classic= I don't mind but we have to ask ourselves a question... &quot;Will i still be playing it till i get bored?&quot;<br />
<br />
Warcraft 3 remaster: No doubt in my mind i would be playing this way much more than wow combined total play time. Something better than BFA</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taeldorian</div><div class="date">2019-05-02, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they announce the next expac and fix the fundamental issues that they’ve talked about wanting to fix recently (class design, pruning, gearing, etc) I think we’ll have a good blizzcon in regards to WoW and a good expansion as well but of course I’m very skeptical. <br />
<br />
I don’t believe at all that they’ll announce mobile shit. They might briefly talk about dipping their hands into the mobile area just to let people know what they’re planning but that’s it. Last years blizzcon was a PR fiasco and I’m sure they wanna avoid it. However if I’m wrong I wouldn’t be surprised.</div></div><hr />

Idk why they don't just make an RPG. They literally have made everything needed for an RPG besides an RPG. Maybe Blizzard just doesn't like making non-online games? Idk.<br />

I guess Diablo is technically an RPG... but still.</div></div><hr />

I guess we need to repeat again… The problem is not that Blizz is making a side Diablo game on mobile. Cool if you like the idea! The problem was they announced it at their major event as their &quot;Main&quot; project on the main stage! That event with their more loyal fans and long time PC players... That was the problem! In fact it was a huge mistake and a really bad move against all their reliable and longtime best customers. We all knows that there's a big difference between mobile and pc players!</div></div><hr />

Exactly lol. The evidence is right there. They also lost players last quarter so in the past 2 quarters they've lost 7-8 mil across all games.<br />
<br />
How can people sit there and say that it's fine when they've lost 20%ish of players in 6-7 months? Are we seriously going to start burying our heads now at cold hard facts that the player count across their games is down?<br />
<br />
And this just further adds to the speculation that MTX is fuelling those &quot;record profits&quot; more than anything.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I've seen anyone claim that player numbers isn't down for WoW. What's your purpose here, have you just become the Slipmat for FFXIV?</div></div><hr />

So calling people out for &quot;doomsaying&quot; (not you) just for pointing out a fact isn't trying to act like there's nothing wrong?<br />

When you drop around 6-8 mil players in half a year there's something wrong.</div></div><hr />

The funniest part is how they've had &quot;free&quot; periods for WoW and Call of Duty among others to try and pad these numbers out and there is still a massive drop off.<br />

I have to wonder about &quot;Activision Blizzard continues to enhance their leadership position in esports.&quot; - What leadership position in esports?

Small problem with your logic buddy. :) Of those franchises that I named that are in a miserable way I like 3 of them more than I like WoW. I'm just realistic about the franchises that I enjoy. I mean, Hearthstone just had a very annoying meta and had a lackluster expansion launch that shifted the meta in another annoying direction. There was also the start of another large PoE league during this quarter while the latest D3 season has been the blandest yet. Heroes saw a bit of a resurgence at the end of last quarter through community effort though that has fallen off again.

Don't encourage them, they may actually go for it! As long as the game is active enough for players to enjoy subs really don't matter. Hell most other MMOs get by pretty well with much less. But you know how it is, every change is bad except the ones i like and are the reason the game is dying (for the past 12 years).</div></div><hr />

That game really does look like the cawadoody bubble has burst.<br />
<br />
Not many people will ascribe that to wow alone, seeing how their other franchises tanked as well. MAU is also an incredibly vague measurement that is easy to keep up by simple interspersed events and &quot;login rewards. Without average time investments of these MAUs and monetary engagement per MAU you can't really defer anything from them, besides that they actually managed to lose 8% users despite the easily inflatable metric that doesn't even specify the franchise. The metric is in fact so weak, Diablo Immortal will be the biggest statisticial scam in the company's history, outshining counting chinese 20 minute net caffee logins as full fleged subs during early/mid WoW. Since we have the 800 million figure it appears that the average user spends around $9 per month on micro transaction. It would interesting to see that per franchise, after all Blizzard tried to conjure up some FOMO last quarter with the shop retirements.. Btw, anyone got the net bookins from the previous quarter at hand?<br />
<br />
Things I don't really get are the statements about &quot;their eSport leadership position&quot; and the growth of people watching overwatch. When exactly did they overtake LoL in terms of eSport? Must have missed that. I also can't fathom who the people are that bumped their viewership numbers, by 30% no less. I don't know a single person that gives a toss, is it that popular in the US/Korea?</div></div><hr />

Me not having a problem with the same things that you have a problem with isn't me ignoring your criticism. I might not agree with all of it, but I'm not actively ignoring it or pretending that it doesn't exist.

The services need updating for sure. But as far as the cash shop for in-game items it is really tame in today's market. The game I play most right now are Jurassic World Alive and Fire Emblem Heroes. A lot because I don't have the time to sit and play on my computer so much. But on Jurassic World Alive 1 &quot;Epic&quot; loot crate is $40. And in Fire Emblem Heroes the average cost to get 1 character to max is either wait 6-7 months or pay $900~. I haven't play Dragalia Lost much yet but based on the randomness of it you can spend about $2,000 and STILL not get the character you want out of their loot crates. I'm at about $300 equivalent saved up in game currency and still not got the character I wanted. When that character has an &quot;increased&quot; chance of showing up.</div></div><hr />

I don't see it happening anytime soon, I imagine WoW (and now remasters of (classic)) have at least five more years to give before major updates/ development becomes financially dubious.<br />

It's all about the chase, my friend. WoW (and Blizz in general) are great targets for internet warriors to shit on. Every REALLY shit games/companies don't have huge hate circlejerks.. they are just dead and forgotten.<br />
<br />
So... Blizz for sure will be dead next year, this time we're super cereal ;D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah well I used to have high hopes &amp; trust for Blizzard. I grew up with them and the games they made. They set the standard and really delivered, for many years. That trust has slowly but steadily gone down.<br />
<br />
At this point, I dont expect much in the future.<br />
<br />
We will get new heroes in Overwatch.<br />
Doubtful we will get anything regarding Starcraft 2. Maybe some push for Esports?<br />
Have my doubts for Diablo 4, but here lies the bigges possibility of a &quot;new&quot; game.<br />
HS gets standard xpac features.<br />
WoW will get a new xpac.<br />
<br />
Sadly I think Blizzard will present some mobile stuff at Blizzcon(even though last year went badly). <br />
Theres an odd chance for a BR game, surely hope not. Theres enough of that already going around.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just wish they had the balls to actually create something fresh and new again, with the Blizzard stample on. They did it with Overwatch, and it was a welcomed game and change.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well at this point Blizzard/activision are so big they can just cop out and create easy cashgrab shite games. It seems like Blizzard dont need to create and release class A games anymore. They can take shortcuts and they obviously live in the short term, from earning call to earning call.<br />
<br />
What once made Blizzard great, and what once made Blizzard THE company to go to if you wanted great games, is now almost depleted. The people who once were in charge there are long gone and the focus has shifted. It ment something when Blizzard released a game, it ment something when it had the Blizzard logo on it.<br />
<br />
They wont die, ofc not. But will they be regarded as highly as they once did? No.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It also may be mostly from King, because Candy Crush made a major change in piling up extra game bonuses, you could continously play lower levels to build up bonuses now you can't do that. And King has the highest MAU numbers in all branches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a professional investor let me assure you that atvi is NOT a good buy. It’s ea and ttwo are better buys within the sector. <br />
<br />
Take atvi for example: they are a company reliant on two aging franchises (cod and wow) and both have hit new low points with fans and will likely see falloff year over year. Their failure is not investing in new gamers for the future. <br />
<br />
Ttwo has red dead, gta, and borderlands for 2019. Ea has fifa and made ultimate team money (don’t sleep on that $) while atvi has... wow classic and mw4? Atvi has nothing for 2019 that is gonna bring in big money</div></div><hr />

WoW, Blizzard, ATVI - none of them are going anywhere, no matter how many YouTubers make clickbait videos saying everything is dying.<br />
<br />
As both a pro stockholder and gamer; there is a small nugget of truth that gamers will be more in tune with game companies and news than stock investors. Many of my stock friends mocked my hard for getting into game stocks last decade but I sold last October and would caution against investing in atvi. Ea and ttwo are worth holding because of their steady cash flow for the foreseeable future, but atvi is in a world of hurt. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is actually the one good performer in the atvi portfolio. Not all of them are winners though and the only game profitable for Blizz atm is wow. Which will need heavy investment to win people back. Secondly, as expensive as wow classic is to redevelop they will never see that money recouped because it comes with our current sub fee<br />
<br />
The issue with atvi vs something like ea, is that atvi put all of its hopes in a few franchises that are inevitably fading away. Bo4 is the most despised cod ever, and even though it sold a lot at launch, it’s prwctically dead now online and only there to abuse whales. Wow and cod aren’t popular enough or gaining ground anymore, and since they legit have no other title worth playing in 2019, they are a poor investment.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, ea has madden and fifa ultimate teams which each generate more money than cod and wow combined. Atvi doesn’t have the luxury of sports titles to carry them yearly. Even ttwo is a better investment from a pure investment standpoint. <br />
<br />
Atvi does not really have a major aaa title this year not named wow classic or cod mw4 and that’s a disaster for shareholders</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep. Just put a 10 sec CD on it or something, and while we're at it: Make it baseline.<br />
<br />
There's several talents where I'm pretty sure if they were just baseline, nobody would mind. Spirit Bomb was insanely good for a good portion of Legion and is really good in BFA, too. The abililty is fun, interacts well with the build, the only &quot;problem&quot; is that you can spam it like crazy.<br />
<br />
As such: Give it a short CD, make it baseline. I doubt any DHs would mind, and we could get another talent that maybe just reduces its cooldown and increases its damage or something if you don't wanna reinvent the wheel.<br />

I can deal with it as is for now but we definitely have the right idea, the cooldown just has to be low enough that we can keep the debuff up.</div></div><hr />

Something all of the three games I've mentioned prior share are name change services. In WoW and FFXIV, the cost is $10 USD, while ESO's service costs 2500 crowns (their cash currency), that's about $20.<br />
<br />
The prices of other similar services are in line with each other as well. Pretty ordinary pricing, if you ask me.<br />

yeah can be debated on how great OW overall is, but I like the game. It was also something new they did.<br />

At this point it looks like Blizzard is done being innovating. They will pump out content for the current games they have a kill it off when its no longer a moneymachine.<br />
