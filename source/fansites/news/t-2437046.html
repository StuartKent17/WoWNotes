He's a big orc. Not just any big orc, but one of the most famous orcs. No matter how much he tries to conceal himself, he'll always have a big goblin-made neon sign above him saying &quot;HORDE!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping it's just another 4% buff... but who knows anymore. I was hoping they'd try and fix frost playstyle a bit, but nope.</div></div><hr />

Eh. He'd just need to cover his arms better and maybe pull the hood further down, and everyone'd be all &quot;oh, it's just one of those steroid monsters from Kul'tiras, nothing to be suspicious about.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's my understanding that that is the 4% buff, that unholy DK had a flat damage reduction of 12% added to them, and by reducing it to 8% that it is effectively a 4% buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would they even need a 12% reduction in the first place? It's not like unholy would be doing too much damage without it.</div></div><hr />
