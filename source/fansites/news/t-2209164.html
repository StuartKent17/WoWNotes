<br />
Apparently neither does Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because Blizzard hates paladins, of course. It's been that way since vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I'd deal twice the amount of damage the other tanks did, I'd be more than happy with the challenge.<br />
<br />
Now, what I think happened is this.<br />
Dev1: Paladins can use bubble and just stand there and dps. Yes, yes and spellwarding. So the bosses should have twice the health.<br />
Dev2: Let's make the stacking debuff bypass everything. Paladin skills included (cause how else would you prove mastery of your class if your skills actually worked as they should).<br />
Dev1: Aren't we forgetting something?<br />
Dev2: Nah.<br />
Later on.<br />
Dev1: Why are these players complaining about the double health? Didn't we have a reason to do that?<br />
Dev2: Sure we did. Can't recall what, but let's just lower it so they stop whining.</div></div><hr />
