Since Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/) still holds the only recorded kill of Ragnaros in heroic mode, it is probably worth reporting that they also killed the 10-Man version as well. Congratulations to them, see their statement below!<br />
<br />
After a very deserving break from a tight raiding schedule that we kept for the past few weeks, we went back in to the Firelands. The goal was pretty simple: Check out the fights on 10-man heroic to gauge their relative difficulty compared to 25-mans. There's been so much discussion on various community sites about this topic, saying that 10-mans are &quot;overtuned&quot; and near unkillable and whatnot. Others saying it's the other way around.<br />
<br />
After a quick clear of the filler bosses yesterday, we decided to go all out on Ragnaros today. We begun importing our 25-man tactics and had multiple very silly wipes. Once we realized we could just ditch the overly complicated tactics, we made several P4 wipes. Soon afterwards we were able to slay him and get the world first 10-man Ragnaros Heroic kill as well.<br />
<br />
All in all, Ragnaros on the 10-man Heroic mode took 32 wipes in total with everything (such as multiple disconnects) included.<br />

Feral performance in PvE<br />
That said, we're happy with Feral performance in PvE overall. It we were to nerf Predatory Swiftness, it'd have a minor impact on PvE. Unheeded Warning is both a PvE and PvP problem. The particular mechanics of the trinket keep it disproportionately powerful for Feral druids. Nerfing Berserk would have PvE ramifications, but we'll take steps overall to make sure your dps doesn’t drop in PvE. We do everything we can to ensure we're considering all aspects of gameplay when approaching class balance. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/187253/explanation-to-zarhym-about-ferals) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2878769242?page=7#140))<br />

Feral stealth isn't superior to Rogue's<br />
Given that they are exactly the same mechanically, this shouldn't be the case. This has been a particularly pervasive myth that I'd like to lay to rest. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/187231/feral-vs-rogue) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2878489481?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
The fact that this shouldn't be the case, doesn't mean it isn't. Also, saying its a myth, or believing it must be, does not make it so.<br />
You're correct. Merely saying something isn't so, doesn't mean a thing.<br />
<br />
Knowing that they're the same ability used by different classes, and knowing that this exact issue has been tested, repeatedly, in response to claims otherwise, does. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/187231/feral-vs-rogue) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2878489481?page=4#79))<br />
<br />
Feral Instinct<br />
This is correct, choosing the Feral spec and gaining Feral Instinct merely brings Feral spec Stealth into line with Rogue baseline stealth (whose talents have been rolled into the ability).

<br />
<br />
Which felt more challenging? 25-man by about a mile and then some. Really, the 10-man heroic bosses just rolled over and gave loot. Ragnaros was a tiny bit challenging, but that was because we tried approaching it in an overly complicated manner (ie., tried to carry over our 25-man tactics).<br />
<br />
There's really no argument even to be made that 10's are at all harder or &quot;overtuned.&quot; They're easier for a multitude of reasons. And that's not a bad thing, considering some of the limitations.</div></div><hr />

Right, and they didn't know the fight after 32 wipes on 25 man? Surely they knew it after 100, 200, 300, 400, 500... <br />

There are more variables in 25 man, and thus more things can go wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They already had their strat with the 25 man it's not like it's a totally different encounter on ten mans. btw on my alt warrior I know it's only reg firelands but we pugged a 25 man FL's and we one shotted all the bosses up until rag, with half the raid dying almost on every fight which was ridiculous. One person dies on 10 and it's pretty much a wipe.<br />

Don't know why but bosses tend to get &quot;much easier&quot; after you actually kill em for the first time.. :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KCee</div><div class="date">2011-07-23, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Downing a boss the first time takes by far the longest. After that things just seem to get way easier. Doenst matter if you wiped 10 times, 100 times, or even 500 times, before the first kill. Once its down the first time, repeating it is not nearly as difficult.<br />
<br />
And of course there's a difference in difficulty when you are taking a group to a raid and gearing up normally/exclusively on 10, vs bringing your best geared people from 25, who are half/nearfull 391 to a 10man raid. Its the difference between 2-3 pieces of 391 gear per person, vs 5-full 391.<br />
<br />
Oh look. 4pc on every one of those toons.<br />
<br />
Until they have a 10man that gear exclusively from the 10man, Nothing they 'SAY' now means anything, simply because they cant compare them equally.<br />
<br />
Either way, short of the comment about 10s, it doesnt take away the feat. Congrats to Paragon for completing it on both raid sizes.</div></div><hr />

But yeah, wonderful, this will shut up all the whiners QQing that 10man is harder than 25man. I mean, I don't read about this stuff and I know from another guild on my server that Baelroc 10H is a joke. They apparently wiped for 2 hours on it before downing it.</div></div><hr />

Either raid size will have its advantages and disadvantages. For example, Ragnaros may be easier in 10 man because there is less chaos in p3 due to the smaller amount of meteors (assuming your DPS is pulling appropriate numbers), and more difficult in 25 man because of the added chaos. On the other hand, Majordomo Staghelm may be more difficult on 10 man because of the high raid damage output, whereas 25 mans may have a slight advantage due to being able to utilize many raid-wide damage reduction cooldowns. Each has their own benefits, each has their own downfall.</div></div><hr />

.... You totally missed my point. <br />
To clarify what my point is, it's how they already know what to do from those 25 wipes that made the fight far easier for them in 10 man, since they obviously know what to do. The fight is still hard thus the wipes. Tactics make every fight easier.</div></div><hr />

It clearly says that they used much more complicated tactics in 25man. <br />
<br />
I dont know how stupid people should be to still insist that 10man is in any way harder.<br />
<br />
All players who play in 25man and then actually kill 10man bosses say that 10man is easier.<br />
Players who say that 10man is harder raid in 10man and never killed anything harder than Shennox 25man heroic.<br />
<br />
Just stop whining and listen to people who experienced BOTH heroic difficulties. At least the ONLY guild in the world that managed to clear all the bosses in all difficulties.</div></div><hr />

Just stop whining and listen to people who experienced BOTH heroic difficulties. At least the ONLY guild in the world that managed to clear all the bosses in all difficulties.<br />
<br />
They simply cannot compare the two sized raids equally simply because 1) They already have experience killing Rag. and 2) The gear difference.<br />
<br />
In a 10man raid, the players wouldnt have nearly the amount of gear that those 10 do.<br />
And anyone can tell you, once you down a boss the first time, repeating it again is much much easier.<br />
<br />
In T11 is was _proven_ that many of the 10 encounters were tuned to high initially for 10mans because they used 25man-sized damage/healthpools/mechanics/etc.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying in T12 that 25mans may or maynot be harder. I'm just saying, in the end, unless everything is equal, you should consider comments like that, to be some what biased. And the comments by DREAM Paragon are biased (refer to my very first sentence).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It clearly says that they used much more complicated tactics in 25man. <br />
<br />
I dont know how stupid people should be to still insist that 10man is in any way harder.<br />
<br />
All players who play in 25man and than actually kill 10man bosses say that 10man is easier.<br />
Players who say that 10man is harder raid in 10man and never killed anything harder than Shennox 25man heroic.<br />
<br />
Just stop whining and listen to people who experienced BOTH heroic difficulties. At least the ONLY guild in the world that managed to clear all the bosses in all difficulties.<br />
<br />
Harder to manage =/= Harder tactic.<br />
The only reason people say 10 man is easier is due to management being far more simple. <br />
<br />
25 man means you need good players to do any progress and you most likely carry a lot of bad players, but in 10 man, it's easier to find 10 people that actually have brains and know what to do, now the tactics are more simple since you don't need to assign many different groups to different things.</div></div><hr />

as for people comparing 10's and 25's... the only once that have a say in it right now are the people that killed it. and that's only paragon. so if they say it's easier in 10, who are you to argue with that? do you have experience in both versions? have you killed it? nope? then what do you base your arguments on?</div></div><hr />

One group (either pro-10 or pro-25 in terms of difficulty) was in for a letdown.<br />
<br />
But honestly: Paragon are the only ones right now who can make any informed decision and say something about the relative difficulty of the 10- and 25- man encounters, especially Ragnaros HC. I'm by no means a fanboy, but I think they are smart enough to take into consideration the amount of gear and experience they took from the 25-man encounter when they judged the difference. They've done both, they'd look no worse if they had stated &quot;well, the tenner is absolutely on par with the 25-man version, really gave us more trouble then we expected&quot;. <br />
<br />
Then again, to each their own. As I said at the top, lots of people were ready to cry out loud when their biased and completely unjustified opinion (for lack of a viable comparison, as in killing Ragnaros on both modes) would not be matched. Same old, same old.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That depends. Take a group with equal skill and starting gear, and have them do 500+ 10 man wipes, then see how many 25 takes.<br />
<br />
Of course, you can't compare them equally, because to do the 10, you can pick and choose your best out of the 25. Yes, the fights are different - but the majority of the mechanics are exactly the same, simply fewer targets/less damage. They learned the fight in 25 - heck, they even admit that they made some adjustments to their strategy, which was likely initially the same as their 25 strategy. They knew the basics of the fight, it just took a few attempts to adjust those strategies to the 10 man fight.<br />
<br />
Oh, and it was nice to see after checking the armory that they 10 man world first killed Heroic Ragnaros with Heroic Ragnaros gear. According to dates looted, not what they had on.</div></div><hr />

LoL. That statement doesnt contradict mine in anyway. I never said that 10 or 25 man is easier. I never even said which I raid. I actually prefer raiding 25mans.<br />
<br />
All I've said was that in T11, some encounters were tuned to high cause they used 25man-sized paramaters for 10 people. I have said nothing about T12.<br />
<br />
It is also true, I cannot comment on difference in difficulty, since I have not downed Heroic Rag on 10 or 25. But my statement about them not being able to compare the two equally w/o bias stands, simply because of two reasons. 1) They already have a Rag kill under thier belt. and 2) They vastly outgear the 10mans that are working on H.Rag. That fact you cannot deny.<br />
<br />
Attacking me doesnt make my statements any less true. <br />
<br />
It COULD be true. 10 mans could be easier then 25 mans. But we do not know that for a fact, just based on Paragon's super skewed comments. Because they are just that. skewed comments based on my two points above.</div></div><hr />

I know right. Like I can go back now w/ 25 people and face roll H.LK and say 25man is easier because I had more trouble killing it on 10man before Cata came then I do now after I'm in T11+ on 25. (BTW.. HEllo?! Extreme example. If anyone takes this seriously....)<br />

I'm sorry, you must of missed the sarcasm.<br />
All I'm saying, is that they have alot more 391's then the average 10man progression guilds do. Gear makes a difference. Having a kill under your belt already makes a difference.<br />
<br />
I have not argued that 10s may or maynot be easier then 25s.<br />
<br />
All I have said, is that thier comments on 10s being easier are just skewed comparisons. Because they have that extra gear, and have that extra experience with a kill. There is NOTHING so far on this thread that disproves this one point.<br />
<br />
Like I've said before, 10mans COULD be easier, but thier experience on both doesnt mean they are 100% correct, simply because they made a 10man with gear and experience from thier 25man raids, which is not the exactly same as a 10man progression raid.</div></div><hr />

Eh sorry to burst your bubble but it's not. And yes indeed when someone fucks up in 10 man it is indeed less forgiving.<br />
<br />
I could make it really simple for you.<br />
1 man raid boss vs 10.000 man raid boss.<br />
1 man dying=wipe.<br />
2000 man dying=you still have a chance.<br />
<br />
again ill make it simple for you.<br />
10 man raid with 5 dps<br />
25 man raid with 17 dps<br />
10man raid: 1 man dying, 20% dps lost<br />
25man raid: 1 man dying, 5,8% dps lost<br />
<br />
The only thing that sucks for 25 man encounters are encounters that need spreading. Anything else; 10 man is harder. It's that simple.<br />
This will eliminate any discussion forever if 25 or 10 man is harder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
While I'm not on the 25mans are harder then 10mans bandwagon (as you can see from my other posts), I will say one thing about this arguement.<br />
<br />
This is not quite 100% true. On things tuned somewhat tight. Losing that 5% dps could mean a wipe. <br />
<br />
Say a 25man boss encounter needs 5m raid DPS over 5 mins, and that in thier current gear, thats exactly how much DPS a raid with 17 DPS can put it (and they cannot drop any healers or tanks), losing that 1 person means the exact same thing as losing that one dps in 10man. <br />
<br />
A WIPE.</div></div><hr />

Look up everyone on that picture they almost have full heroic loots from firelands fucking pathetic<br />
<br />
Because those 65 items went to those 10 ppl, oh wait. All those 10 were in half T11 gear on kill so coolstory bro. Also there's no point say &quot;omg 4set already&quot; half of them dont have it and if you are raiding 10man you are able to get it anyway(given that raggy and majordomo dont drop same token all the time).<br />
<br />
also they said that the tactics for 10man were way more straight forward, instead of being complicated. So if they were progressing it on 10man they wouldnt have to spend time to create these tactics they needed to do the 25man.<br />
<br />
The question was Which is easier 10 or 25man, and on T12 it is 10man. T11 was another story before the nerfs, ask ensidia if u want. T10 and before that i guess every1 knows which one was easier.</div></div><hr />

I could make it really simple for you.<br />
1 man raid boss vs 10.000 man raid boss.<br />
1 man dying=wipe.<br />
2000 man dying=you still have a chance.<br />
<br />
again ill make it simple for you.<br />
10 man raid with 5 dps<br />
25 man raid with 17 dps<br />
10man raid: 1 man dying, 20% dps lost<br />
25man raid: 1 man dying, 5,8% dps lost<br />
<br />
The only thing that sucks for 25 man encounters are encounters that need spreading. Anything else; 10 man is harder. It's that simple.<br />
This will eliminate any discussion forever if 25 or 10 man is harder.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but that logic is stupid as I don't know what. what you write asumes that the encounter is 100% equal. why would the failure margin be the same in 10 and 25? because you loose less dps for 1 death in 25man just means that the enrage has to be tighter so you can't loose that 1 person. also dps is not the only thing that makes an encounter difficult. in 25 you often get more crap that can wipe you.<br />

Their sponsors expect them to be the best, how can they truly be that if they don't raid on the harder raid size mode? Plus I don't think you get progression and theorycrafting if you don't think the 500 wipes on 25-man was the real progression for the 10-man kill too. They had the perfect raid setup, they had better gear then any 10-man guild out there and they knew every single mechanic of the fight. Of course they won't need as many tries as on 25-man. If a 10-man guild that killed Ragnaros could scale up their members to 25 persons, all playing really good classes for the encounter, they would take him down pretty quickly too.</div></div><hr />

Does it really matter which is the most challenging if you are having fun and not just rolling through content -yourself- in a month? <br />
<br />
As far as it goes, I think 25m will be more challenging overall, but also slightly more forgiving. You are pretty much guaranteed to have 3 bres and all buffs covered, but more people means more silly wipes and less space to work with. It's mostly the holy shit amount of cd's you got that I think gives it an edge over 10m at times. To blow it way over the top, you could hypothetically bring 17 hunters (pets for buffs) and get ~20+ deterence going effectively giving you more than a minute of dps over an enrage timer granted that there is no aoe blowing you up. That and it happens more than once that we don't have a buff in our 10m group, although so far its more of an inconvience than a 'hard'.</div></div><hr />

So, have you actually raided the content or are you just another sideline commenter who doesn't know wtf he's talking about, interpreting at random what Paragon says?<br />

Hmm my guild is 3 of 7 in 25 and 6 of in 10man. Since Firelands is very mechanic based on fights you can't always find 25 people who are smart while finding a solid 10man is easy. Take the Beth'tilac (http://www.wowhead.com/npc=52498) fight for example. In 10man the little spiders spawn from 1 area. In 25man the little spiders spawn in 3 areas with an HP more proportioned to 25man. So if you lose a dps either up top or down low it has big effects. 25man is always harder for the fact you need more coordination and we know most guilds find like 15-20 good raiders and the rest are ones that make you cringe at times.</div></div><hr />

I took the liberty of writing down the average item level of every player present in the 10 man hc raggy kill. I then took the liberty of writing down the item level of every player in the guild Hordlinge ( Currently highest rated 10 man strict guild ), that were present in their last kill, Majordormo staghelm on 10/7<br />
<br />
. Now, there is a small margin of error because some people were logged out in off spec / pvp gear, in that case I took the item level - 2, in other cases I tooked the equipped item level when they were in main spec gear.( since really, who cares about pvp gear? ). 90% of them was in main spec gear so no issues here. However, since hordlinge did not release and kill screen, I only managed to find 9 players from their 10 man Majordormo kill. <br />
Maniax, Betänkung, Nerloran, Lurielle, Johnyy, Synera, Fyla, Sceto, Jaykobb. <br />
If anyone know the 10th, I would be pleased, sorry, but I could not find the 10th.<br />
<br />
The paragons 10 players have a total combined item level of 3781, leading them to have an average of 378.1 per player.<br />
PARAGON - 378.1 per player.<br />
<br />
Hordlinges 9 players have a total combined item level of 3407, leading them to have an average of 378.6 ( Rounded up from 378.5555555555 ) per player. <br />
Hordlinge - 378.6 per player. <br />
<br />
So all in all, these guilds are pretty much identically geared, the only thing different between them was some rng. ( Also this is very strange since Paragon clearly killed ragnaros 2 times, so they should have more gear, not less. Something that I find noteworthy and I really did not expect, is that Hordlinges tanks actually had MORE gear than the paragon tanks. Lazeil ( Paladin Tank ), was actually the lowest geared player of all 19 players, scoring in at a boggling 374 item level. Sejta, Rakez ( Paragons ) and Johnyy, Jaykobb ( Hordlinge ) were the shared top 4 players all 4 having 382 item level. Now please, will you shut up about your &quot;they have more gear things&quot; when you dont ever bother checking the facts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're aiming for a first kill in either raid size, your setup *should* be flexible. If you're running around with your rainbow raid of ten classes, expecting to leave everyone else in the dust -- well, good luck with that. <br />
<br />
It's not like the encounters were absolute walkovers that could've been 8-manned (with the possible exception of Majordomo... damn) either. Easier? Yes, but it's not like the first four bosses are that hard (or that much harder) on 25 either. We also did the first six with what we consider a balanced setup, but I suppose having more than one druid invalidates whatever opinions we might have gathered from those as well.<br />
<br />
Wait for the longer version, which I hope we have time to write asap. I reckon it should be an interesting read to people who haven't done both raid sizes.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
Okay, to be fair, you could 8-man Alysrazor (but I guess you could 20-man him in 25 as well).</div></div><hr />

A few weeks of extremely fortunate Gear drops for those 10 people can also gear them faster than those getting drops from the 10man version.<br />

<br />
I would suggest you read the post above you that clearly states that Paragon's 10-man Raid setup averaged at 378 ilvl, which is roughly the same that other top 10-man guilds have. <br />
<br />
<br />
I love how they keep blaming wipes on disconnects. it either looks like an excuse or it looks like they all need better connections, because they mention it ALL THE TIME.<br />
<br />
Disconnects have mostly happened because of the immense lightning storms we have had in Finland for the past 2-3 weeks as stated before and have next to nothing to do with the quality of their connections.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, obviously wiping over 500 times in 25 man didnt help with the 10 man kill in any way... Paragon are a bunch of arrogant turds. :&gt;<br />
<br />
Why is it so hard to understand that wiping in 25-man doesn't make you that much better in 10-man.<br />
<br />
10-man and 25-man are different, so you cannot just carry tactics learned from wiping many times in 25-man, over to 10-man version of the fight. As Paragon stated, it only screwed them up.<br />
<br />
They did it in 32 wipes with 500+ wipes on 25-man. Now consider other Hardcore 10-man guilds that have already wiped on the 10-man version of Ragnaros for 200+ times and still haven't been able execute it perfectly. Now realize the difference...</div></div><hr />

&quot;they overgeared it&quot;<br />

25 gives more Loot<br />
1 dead Person out of 25 can much easier be compensated until b-rezzed (3 times possible in 25) or until the end of combat than 1 dead Person out of 10<br />
The tuning can`t be that bad, because there's only the 10m Ragna hc Kill of Paragon and there are only slighly more kills of Majordomo and Baleroc in 10 man raiding but there are over 15k 10man Raids and only 3k 25man Raids on wowprogress. If 10man raiding were significantly easier those numbers would be more like 500 Kills of 10man hc majordomo and 50 kills of him in 25man.<br />

<br />
Making comparisons is pointless, because the REAL facts that matter are these:<br />
<br />
10 and 25 will never be properly balanced. Ever. Anyone from Blizzard, if you are reading this, you will never succeed at 10 vs. 25 player balance. One will always be easier or harder than the other. 25 man is simply harder to set up, organize, and run, as organizing more people at ANYTHING is always harder. It might be more punishing if you run a company and have 3 employees and one quits, but it sure as hell doesn't take remotely close to as much effort to keep them all well trained and on task as it would if you had 50 employees.<br />
<br />
-Regarding your points, 25 man gives more loot because it's harder to set up. There has to be some reward here because it takes more effort. Arguing this point, by the way, is completely idiotic. I've done plenty of both. Running a 10 man is an absolute breeze compared to running a 25.<br />
-1 dead isn't as punishing on 25, but there's also a 2.5 times higher chance someone will die.<br />
-If Baleroc is being killed on 10 man a full minute faster than on 25, Blizzard completely failed at tuning the encounter. That is a MASSIVE oversight and balancing failure.<br />
-10 mans are balanced to not require every single buff. You can go without one or two.<br />
<br />
The only way Blizzard is going to make everyone happy and keep this model of 10=25 rewards wise is if Realm First achievements are separate for each setting, and your guild (and players involved) are disqualified for one by obtaining the other, and all achievements note whether you have done them on 10 or 25 or both. This doesn't mean gear needs to be different (it doesn't). It doesn't mean the achievements themselves need to be different (they don't). It just means there needs to be some way to distinguish how you killed the boss. 10 player guilds should not be competing with 25 player guilds. But they will be, until the achievements are changed to note which setting you progressed on. I think nearly everyone can agree this 10 vs. 25 debate is ridiculous, but unfortunately, the only ones who can lay it to rest are Blizzard employees, by separating the Realm First achievements and having some way to denote which setting you killed the boss on in game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Their average ilvl gear in 25 man could be 374 and their 10 man it could be 376 (numbers are not a fact), it could also be the other way around but just pointing out that fact.<br />
<br />
They have also allready killed the boss, like so many say: &quot;After you kill it once it gets easier&quot;. <br />
<br />
Maybe next time they do it 10 man all the way so we can see for sure? Doubt it though, and really don't care. What would really solve this whole thing is to put seperate achivement on 10 and 25 man mode.<br />
<br />
All I care about is that 10 man makes it easier to raid with my buddies (Iceland seems to have a hard time keeping a 25 man raid going).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kelyne</div><div class="date">2011-07-23, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just some quick background - I am a GM of a 25 man guild (the only one on my back water server). I lead 25s three time a week and a 10 with alts.<br />
<br />
There have been a lot of good arguments here for 25 vs 10. My two cents is that 25's would be vastly closer in difficulty to 10 if the normalized the mechanics. While it is true that 25 is harder to manage than 10 I think that more 25s would have success (And therefore have more folks willing muster the needed management for them) if the tactics on ten where the same as on 25. <br />
<br />
For instance Baleroc - We killed this on ten man and laughed at how we two shot it on the first night. Coming in on 25 we wiped for four hours due to the management of two crystals at the same time as opposed to one. I think if blizzard wants to make 25 the same difficultly there should have only been one crystal. Maybe require it be split across four people before it resolves and a new one comes out; the two at the same time makes the encounter a cluster FFFF to manage and deal with. <br />
<br />
Another example is Beth'tilac - Three spiderling spawn points vs one. In case you can't see the issue with that... They come from different areas preventing you from kiting drones away. Moreover it requires you to split up your healers at least one to an area. It screws you for stacking to heal for aoe damage... I'm just spouting now. The long and short is that the mechanics themselves are vastly more difficult when blizzard does that.<br />
<br />
I think they did a better job of equally tuning Shannox and Alysrazor. If more fights were tuned like that I think a lot of the valid difficultly comparison arguments outside of management would be mute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-10 mans are balanced to not require every single buff. You can go without one or two.<br />
<br />
Sorry, I just had to quote this.<br />
<br />
Your first point is just flat out wrong. Fire is fire - there can be 10 people or even a million people in a raid, it's up to each individual to not stand in stuff. People in 25 man raids aren't 2.5 times as dumb, slow, or ignorant, so there is no increased chance that any one individual would fail on 25 man but wouldn't on 10 man.<br />
<br />
As for buffs - 3% raid damage? 10% spellpower? 8% spell damage taken? Spell Crit?<br />
I don't care what anyone says, missing a raid buff, particularly some of the more powerful ones, is a raid gimp. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
Your argument seems to be entirely based around the fact that 25 man people are harder to organise than 10. For the large part I entirely agree with you - particularly with assignments to specific things. (Though again, individual organisation is up to each raider and is not dependant on raid size).<br />
<br />
25 man is just more. You have more raid cooldowns, more buffs, more players, more innervates and battle resses, more people that can break Face Rages, more Life Grips, more freedom with class stacking.<br />
You used Baleroc as an example - It was killed first on 25 man, why? Because just like Chimaeron there are more people. The dps requirements were huge, and as soon as the enrage hit the boss started chewing through players. IIRC Method killed Baleroc 40 seconds after the Enrage - because for one thing they had 25 people for the boss to eat through, which takes time. But also, they had more Hunters, Rogues and Mages who could Deterrence / Evasion / Mirror Image to slow the boss down.<br />
<br />
You can't pull tricks like that in 10 man - and you complain that the boss has less scaled health on 10 than 25? Yeah, there's a good reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
Apologies - I don't mean to sound challenging. I hate posting in these debates, because they're pointless and just filled with fan boys who believe that what they raid is the best and only way to raid. Neither is easier or harder than the other - perhaps some fights there is a discrepancy, but you know that normally comes down to the amount of room for players to spread out in (Ragnaros and Al'akir anyone?). 25 man raids have more inc damage and more boss health to deal with, but that's greatly offset by the freedom and numbers they get too.</div></div><hr />

Do the math and see that 10 man also requires less DPS per person. Also note that the noxa did 10 man Baleroc in less than 6 minutes on their first kill so they didn't even hit enrage (the log should still be in worldoflogs). I think it was almost a whole minute faster than Method. Baleroc should be considered easier in 10 man simply because it requires less DPS per person to pull it off and we are not even considering the raid mechanics that are harder in 25 than 10 man (soaking 2 crystals instead of 1, having more players so it's harder to avoid spreading torment).</div></div><hr />

<br />
A less trolly way of looking at it is this.<br />
<br />
Paragon has a high level of skill, but what sets them apart is time available and willing to spend applying that skill. There are definitely others out there that are just as good, if not better, but they can only commit so much time. The true metric would be progress per hour. There may be a guild out there in time that is 7/7 heroic but they only put 10 hours into it versus the 50+ hours Paragon did to achieve that point. I would have to say based on that, there is your best guild.<br />
<br />
It's all theoretical and a metric not measured but would be interesting to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So tired of those random scrubs - excuse the choice of words - thinking they can judge the content they won't see. I hope for you you have set some steps in heroic on either 10 or 25, but your post certainly doesn't make it sound like it. If it's so easy, by all means kill Rag for us.<br />
<br />
so you actually killed 10 and 25 man Rag hc to judge which of them is easier ? NO. you didnt ... i dont think you have the right to argue Paragon statement anyway, if they say that 10 man was easier, then its must be true, because they are then only ones who done 7/7 hc in both modes, 10 and 25. end of story.</div></div><hr />

RNG, human error there alot of thing that make it different, that explains the 500+ wipes they had to do.<br />

I do not care about the raid buffs, Combat Rezzes, tuning and what not, there's so many factors that make 10-man easier it's unreal, DPS reqs, spawns, amount of mechanics, space available and the communication ease between 10 people.<br />

You gotta be kidding me? Baleroc was 9-mannable since the Heroics even opened on the 10-man and you would get a kill before the enrage. On 25s, you had to play _perfect_ and make no mistakes, yet you still had to deal with the enraged kiting. Majordomo was 9-mannable, probably easily done with 8 as well.<br />

That's a lot if text right there but what it comes down to is that 10-man can't hit the enrage or they would die in a matter of seconds. The real enrage, and with that I mean when everyone dies, is earlier on 10-man since you might have 1-2, max 3 people who can prolong the fight during the enrage.</div></div><hr />

as for people comparing 10's and 25's... the only once that have a say in it right now are the people that killed it. and that's only paragon. so if they say it's easier in 10, who are you to argue with that? do you have experience in both versions? have you killed it? nope? then what do you base your arguments on?<br />
<br />
Yes, but they did it with gear they got from clearing the 25M and also they had experience with the mechanisms. They only had to tweek the mechanisms... not learn them from scratch like they did on the 25M version. 500 wipes vs 32 wipes is misleading. I guarantee you that next week when they go back to do 25M again, they will not wipe nearly 500 times... gear and experience counts for alot. A third point... they could handpick their best performers in the 25M run to bring.... ie.. the top 40% of their 25M team were brought.</div></div><hr />

Also, lets not forget.. they have always been known as a 25M raiding guild...This is correct but you're forgetting the point that you still need to adapt from playing in a 25-man environment with all the Cooldowns under the sun to deal with things as well as the positioning and tactic changes.<br />

This being said, do you really believe Paragon were using the wrong tactics for 500 wipes and then got the correct tactic for the kill and now they'll one-shot it or kill it within 30 tries without fail? I personally don't believe that's the case but hopefully we'll see before they've farmed too much gear for their second 25-man kill to make the debate less valid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">underzenith</div><div class="date">2011-07-23, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your first point is just flat out wrong. Fire is fire - there can be 10 people or even a million people in a raid, it's up to each individual to not stand in stuff. People in 25 man raids aren't 2.5 times as dumb, slow, or ignorant, so there is no increased chance that any one individual would fail on 25 man but wouldn't on 10 man. No, but 2.5 times the number of people increases the likelihood by, strangely enough, 2.5 times that one individual will be stupid or fall asleep and die in the fire. <br />
As for buffs - 3% raid damage? 10% spellpower? 8% spell damage taken? Spell Crit? I don't care what anyone says, missing a raid buff, particularly some of the more powerful ones, is a raid gimp. Simple as that. Having 10% spell power vs. 6% spell power will result in maybe 2000 overall raid dps IF AND ONLY IF you are very caster heavy. Same goes for the other buffs you listed. If you're missing many of them, sure, your raid dps is going to suck, but that's pretty hard to pull off as any serious organized raid group. Missing one isn't the end of the world. <br />
You used Baleroc as an example - It was killed first on 25 man, why? Because just like Chimaeron there are more people. The dps requirements were huge, and as soon as the enrage hit the boss started chewing through players. IIRC Method killed Baleroc 40 seconds after the Enrage - because for one thing they had 25 people for the boss to eat through, which takes time. But also, they had more Hunters, Rogues and Mages who could Deterrence / Evasion / Mirror Image to slow the boss down. You can't pull tricks like that in 10 man - and you complain that the boss has less scaled health on 10 than 25? Yeah, there's a good reason. Enrage isn't a problem on 10 man, that's where the flaw is. It's removing an aspect of the fight that makes it much more difficult on 25 for 10 man, meaning the fight is drastically easier on 10 man, and this is my entire point. TENS AND TWENTY FIVES WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER BE BALANCED. It is incredibly arrogant on their part to claim they are even remotely close. They aren't, especially not this tier, and I wish for the sanity of tens of thousands of people that they would admit their mistake in claiming such foolishness and separate the achievements (especially realm firsts) associated with each type of raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not care about the raid buffs, Combat Rezzes, tuning and what not, there's so many factors that make 10-man easier it's unreal, DPS reqs, spawns, amount of mechanics, space available and the communication ease between 10 people.<br />
<br />
10-man is easier and I think Paragon have proved it in their 32 wipes with a new tactic yea yea?<br />

It is not reasonable to judge the difficulty of an encounter based on experiences of people who are not technically properly geared for it. Here is a somewhat simplified illustration: Let's say as a result of being undergeared(and all world firsts are done that way lately) an average dpser pulls 2k less dps than he/she should in a 10 man group composed of 5 dpsers. That is 10k less dps per second. 600k dps per minute and 3.6 million dps less per 6 minutes For a 25 man group with 17 dpsers the stats would be 34kdps less per second, 2.04 million per minute 12.24 million per 6 minutes As one can see, 12.24 million/3.6 million = 3.4 (also equal to 17/5)which is much greater than 2.5 difference that should be implied by differences in size (in reality an average dpser will pull more in 25 man than in 10 due to more numerous buffs but this is a simple illustration) Now immediately, some people will this proves 25 mans are harder. In 25 mans, your &quot;undergearedness&quot; gets magnified but it is not proper to judge an encounter using gear levels for which it was not intended. There is reason why blizzard does not recognize world firsts. If you want compare heroic firelands 10 vs 25 make groups with item levels for which they were designed and make judgments accordingly. In 10 mans there is greater responsibility per player, less margin to mess up (nobody can mess up or it is a wipe) severe restrictions on make up (can't take equivalent number of 11 feral druids there) and slower token/valor/loot accumulation. People trash 10 mans out of elitism but I am glad blizzard saw that people should be able to enjoy the game to its fullest without knowing 24 other people to do so.</div></div><hr />

well, an objective way to compare those two would be if they run separately 10man form the begining, not after they cleared it on 25. Still, they used 4 druids. Either 10man is so &quot;easy&quot; that setup doesnt matter or it requires some serious raid stacking and advantages druids provide in their specs. When they kill it with 3 shaman, I will be impressed :p</div></div><hr />

I don't know about your guild. But is hard to keep 25 guy with perfect conection! Almost every 2-3 try someone dc or have spike lag that kill him or make he lose huge dps. On 10m probabily that don't happen so often but in 25m the % is higher and happen many times. I wouçd say every 2-3 trys one try is trash because disconnects.</div></div><hr />

Noxa is only a bunch of alts from a 25 man guild. Better to compare with Hordlinge that is actually the best 10 man guild. ( World 3 10 man, best 10 man guild, lol ).<br />

Not sure where you're getting this info, but I can confirm at least one so far is absolutely wrong in Sejta their tank is at 384 ilvl. They very well could have changed their gear knowing people are looking at it as well.</div></div><hr />

The characters that were in the 10 man kill were in no way given extra loot. Someone can go over the armory and figure out if they had more loot than they would have gotten from a few 10 man raids but I won't bother to do that. The dudes who were on the kill were taken because of their class, not gear. Also I won't bother to check but I really doubt most of the raid had &quot;half 391 gear&quot;. We don't just gear 25 characters. We have over 35 members and we have given gear to alts as well like Krimsy who probably has more 3 times more 391 loot than I do (because I don't have any). by paragon about the loot and gerar they had</div></div><hr />

You can check their character activity feeds. <br />
<br />
If you check it, you will see that they dont have gear better than the one equipped and the reason why the general ilvl you see is a bit increased than the equipped ilvl is due to ruthless pvp gear they obtained recently. Check the activity feeds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More loot drops per boss in 25 man. If the guild intentionally chooses 10 people from their 25 man runs to be the only ones to get that loot, then those ten players accumulate more heroic raid items than if those same ten players ran a 10 man.<br />
<br />
This becomes unfounded when you realise that loot was being distributed to more than 10 set individuals within their 25man guild runs.</div></div><hr />

I bet they dont have that many repeat attempts normally.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aaaah assumptions. Hmm, to quote their site, &quot;After a very deserving break from a tight raiding schedule that we kept for the past few weeks.&quot; yea that makes it seem like they had 25 people sitting outside waiting for that fateful call to come help kill a 10 man boss they probably dont give two shits about in the end. To me it seems a few wanted to raid again this week and try out 10 mans, and now the entire 10 man community is butt hurt they made one statement about one bosses difficulty level. Its like all the 10 man people are afraid their kills are somehow less valued now that the #1 guild in the world made an observational statement based on their experience. <br />
<br />
To reinforce my statement, you are complete and total idiot if you think a guild as good as paragon would have 35 people logging on to take on a 10 man boss. If they had the numbers, they would do as they ALWAYS do and kill things on 25.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This pretty much sums up the 10 vs. 25 man debate. Even outgearing the heroic content at this point, it took an additional 32 wipes, which is a solid raid night or two for most guilds to get a repeat kill. While it may still reason that 10 man is &quot;easier&quot; , the fact that other hardcore 10 man guilds that have spent the same amount of time on this boss didn't manage a kill either says everything you need to know about how hard this encounter is, and how close 10 and 25 mans are. <br />

Gratz to Paragon on the kill, but i still can't help but wonder if this is the longest gap between a 1st and 2nd kill between two different guilds. Especially considering no one else has managed to yet</div></div><hr />

You don't really take everything that paragon says at face value do you? These people work year round to gear and prepare for future raids, test them on ptr, theorycraft, level new profession to get the edge (magically level engineering on a whim), to try to get world firsts. The only reason they did this was because they resent what happened with Al'Akir in tier 11. They don't want anyone to kill any end boss in any raid on heroic difficulty on 10/25 before they do. They did this to try to completely discredit 10 man raiding (maybe troll the forums in the process to) in case of any future tiers if AlAkir scenario reappears to not count it at all.<br />
<br />
Normal 10 man guilds don't run with 2 boomkins(4 druids total) as their base setup and by their own admission 32 wipes implies certain modifications. If you take what they say and translate it, it means 10 man difficulty was not so easy &quot;that a caveman could do it&quot; and required adjustment even given their vast experience with 25. Does not it strike you as odd, that an &quot;unimportant 10 man run&quot; they don't care about featured both their tanks (sejta(who is also their guildmaster) and lazeil)? They certainly did not bring scrubs to the equation.<br />
<br />
Combining 10 and 25 was one the best decisions blizzard ever made. It rubbed a bunch of elitists the wrong way but given the VAST MAJORITY of paying customers a more enjoyable route to pve.</div></div><hr />

Pretty inaccurate way of gauging difficulty.<br />
I don't know if you looked at their 25man kill, but a good portion of the toons in the kill, were alts.<br />
<br />
As to all the 'amg paragon is soo bais in their opinion of what was harder because they already killed it, and had so much gear'<br />
<br />
What would be unbias? A guild who ONLY killed heroic 25man rag, and a guild who ONLY killed heroic 10man rag? no; because those would be two different guilds bickering among eachother until they are blue in the face (much like whats going on in this thread, eh).<br />
<br />
End of the day, they are THE BEST guild in the world, they claimed both 25man and 10man heroic rag world first kills, miles ahead of any other guild (still no other guilds at the time of this post). The only way one person can compare both 25man and 10man heroic rag encounters, is for the person to have experienced, and downed them both. Ofcorse in what order would tilt the bias, but only slightly. <br />
<br />
My point is, the person that said that, is in the TOP guild in the world. I repeat the WORLD. Out of the 11.4 million people that play this game, those 30 (or so) people, are the absolute, un-disputable best. I trust their opinions.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they should be able to do all 3 types of specs including 2 completely different dps specs and expect to be the same and/or superior then other classes. They have variety and options therefore they should all be slightly worse, other classes only get one spec and are still worse off then the multi-god that is druids. That's why I now roll druids because, other then paladins, they seem to be blizzards pet/favorite class.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention they brought their two highest geared tanks and stacked 4 druids from their 25man team... Most people attempting 10 man content don´t have the luxury of bringing the highest dps and best geared tanks from their 25 man team...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not care about the raid buffs, Combat Rezzes, tuning and what not, there's so many factors that make 10-man easier it's unreal, DPS reqs, spawns, amount of mechanics, space available and the communication ease between 10 people.<br />
<br />
10-man is easier and I think Paragon have proved it in their 32 wipes with a new tactic yea yea?<br />
<br />
*532 wipes, period. We don't know if they'd have wiped 500 times on 10 man, probably not but if they had wiped 200 times lets say, then went to 25 man with all that knowledge, they'd probably have killed 25 in 50ish attempts, then you'd be saying 25's are easier.<br />
<br />
Knowledge is power.</div></div><hr />

While the other top 10man guilds dont do this eh?<br />
<br />
<br />

Imagine yourself in the same situation of a boss ala &quot;Al'Akir&quot; which was easier in 10man. Imagine killing &quot;al'akir&quot; in both difficulties and then kept insisting that 10man and 25man alakir version are of the same difficulty.....wouldn't you be an idiot in the eyes of the whole community that tried both difficulties and saw that 10man &quot;alakir&quot; was significantly easier than 25man? Now whereever you saw &quot;al'akir&quot; put Ragnaros and read it again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Normal 10 man guilds don't run with 2 boomkins(4 druids total) as their base setup and by their own admission 32 wipes implies certain modifications. If you take what they say and translate it, it means 10 man difficulty was not so easy &quot;that a caveman could do it&quot; and required adjustment even given their vast experience with 25. Does not it strike you as odd, that an &quot;unimportant 10 man run&quot; they don't care about featured both their tanks (sejta(who is also their guildmaster) and lazeil)? They certainly did not bring scrubs to the equation.<br />
Dont compare your 10man guild or other &quot;normal&quot; 10mans... who speaks about &quot;normal&quot; 10mans? Check in wowprogress the top 10mans and check their rosters. They have access to every spec in multitudes. I can see already the 2 first with over 4 boomkins with over 373 ilvl.... (go in wowprogress, filter for 10man guilds, click the 2 first guilds and then click on the link that sends you to the armory).<br />
Aaa, and who is scrub in paragon or the top 10man guilds?<br />

<br />
<br />
For the people that continue to insist on paragon's people overgearing the 10man ragnaros.<br />
Lets find the actual numbers. <br />
Everything is available in armory. <br />
<br />
And as of today 23/7/2011 I can see the following in armory:<br />
Paragon 10man <br />
Player-&gt;Ilvl Equipped<br />
<br />
Ilonie-&gt; 378<br />
Lappe-&gt; 376<br />
Lihas-&gt; 377<br />
Baltha-&gt; 380<br />
Arx-&gt; 379<br />
Sejta-&gt; 382<br />
Synti-&gt; 378<br />
Rakez-&gt; 382<br />
Jubeto-&gt; 376<br />
Lazeil-&gt; 374<br />
Average: 378.2 ilvl equiped<br />
<br />
<br />
Noxa's Players in their majordomo hc kill video<br />
Player -&gt;Ilvl equipped<br />
Wendy-&gt; 378<br />
Thovald -&gt; 375<br />
wallshok-&gt; 378<br />
Seife-&gt; 379<br />
Dexter-&gt; 379<br />
Yodalana-&gt; 381<br />
Harpye-&gt; 378<br />
Lisira-&gt; 374<br />
Selfi-&gt; 375<br />
Zumie-&gt; pvp gear equipped <br />
<br />
Excluding Zumie, Noxa's 9 players have 377.4 average ilvl equiped.<br />
<br />
The numbers just speak for themselves....<br />
The people that killed twice ragnaros hc have just 1 ilvl more than the best -so far- 10man guild....<br />
Please stop this argument with the heavily overgeared 25man players going in 10man and &quot;stealing&quot; kills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The gear arguement is just a farce really, clutching at straws I would call it. Also a world top 10-man guild I'm sure would have alts and surplus members in order to switch around set-up etc and run alt raids to gear them also due to their reputation and world standings, don't be so naive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowdoom</div><div class="date">2011-07-24, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, when a guild kills a boss. Does it typically take them just as long to kill it again? Are 10 and 25 mans completely different mechanics? Do 10 man guilds have a plethora of 35 people to hand pick, for each encounter? You're an idiot if you think 10 man h rag was completely unfamiliar to them, its just a repeat kill for them for them to stroke their e-peen and act like 25 man is harder. Real 10 man guilds can't keep that many people waiting around for perfect composition of fights. 32 attempts for a -repeat- kill is quite a few. I bet they dont have that many repeat attempts normally.<br />
<br />
What about getting 25 ppl with a good internet together at the same time? And what make you think 10 man raid doesn't have the other ppl sitting outside the instance waiting to be rotated in? Many 10 man raids have 11-14 players as a main raider so it's just the same. They wiped for 32 attemps more because they have to adjust the new positioning, new healing way, adds managing, etc.<br />
<br />
What you should think in comparing 10 and 25 man is not only about the difficulty, but also another factors like teamwork and stability of internet. People gives more credit to 25 man raiding because it needs *a lot more* of those additional factors than 10 man. <br />
<br />
My friend is a member of 10 man raiding guild and sometimes it's very annoying to listen to them moarning about how hard 10 man is over 25 man, how unfair it is when it comes to loots, how hard it is when only 1 ppl didnt show up and they cant raid at all. Well I bet he never think about the same problem in 25 man, 25 ppl, 25 lives, 25 stories, 25 internet connections and computers. This can go on and on forever.<br />
<br />
I'm gald Paragon kill this on 10 man. IMO they just do it to prove that the boss is killable and not overtuned in 10 man as some random ppl used to said.<br />
<br />
And lets face it, many 10 man raiding guild choose to raid as a 10 man because it is impossible for them to find 25 ppl with proper connection, skills, and gears. As I've said, it's not only about the tune or difficulty but about the other factors. Some bosses will be a lot easier in 25 than 10 and some will be a lot harder in 25 than in 10.</div></div><hr />

Yes, 500+ wipes with all ten of their people experiencing ragnaros, which is THE SAME FIGHT on 10 and 25, exact same fight, and 32 more wipes on THE SAME FIGHT. Is it so hard to comprehend that the same people, were doing the same boss, just with a different number of players? If they did ragnaros heroic 10 man before 25, do you think they would have not taken 500 attempts? Do you think that 99% of every guild getting a repeat kill each week of a boss they have downed is just mere coincidence? THEY KNEW THE FIGHT and it was the next reset, they didn't do 25m on those toons just 10 man.</div></div><hr />

It's the exact same fight, but 10 man and 25 needed to be done with a different strat. So basically is not that exact same fight.<br />
<br />
If you really know the fight, you would know for example, P2 with the Seeds dmg, 10 man is a lot easier to minimize the damage and healing with the different strat since there're only 10 ppl. If you read what they've said you'll see that they got rid of their complicated strat they used in 25 because it's not fit for 10 man, then they killed the boss. The point is 10 man guilds said the boss is overtuned in 10man so Paragon go to see if its true or not, and it turns out not for them and kick that overtuned bullshit out of the window.</div></div><hr />

You know what happens when there are 25 people, compared to 10 people? you have more raid cooldowns to survive BS like seeds. You have more knockbacks for the same amount of firelords. Failing to see the point? Its not that hard to see if you have half a brain. Paragon is the only one that knows, they are trying to discredit 10 mans to make themselves feel better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're the only guild in the world to do both 10 and 25 H Rag. They don't need to discredit one difficulty size in order to feel better. Their world first makes them feel pretty good. <br />
<br />
And you sound like another 10 man raider who is upset that 10 man is easier than 25 man. What you really should be upset about are the claims Blizzard made about 10 and 25 being equal difficulty, when they so clearly are not.</div></div><hr />

If 10 man were that much harder I'd have expected them to have a litle bit more trouble, it is hader after all right? oh wait...</div></div><hr />

Is it harder than 25man or not? I think the wipe number can tell a bit. Yes they knew the fight, but they gotta adapt some strategy also. Only 32 wipes proof that it is not so hard and possible for any guild to try it if they know correct tactic. And i think it may require some special tactics else others might have down it in 10man already.</div></div><hr />

You have more knockbacks for the same amount of firelords. Failing to see the point? Its not that hard to see if you have half a brain. Paragon is the only one that knows, they are trying to discredit 10 mans to make themselves feel better.<br />
<br />
Making themselves feel better? If you want to put that logic to it, I think it would be better to brag that it only took them 32 attempts to kill a &quot;harder&quot; form of the boss, compared to 500+ on a 25 man easier version.<br />
<br />
So, I'll form this same argument in another way, hopefully this time it will make sense to you.<br />
<br />
Potential statement from Paragon - &quot;10 man was WAY harder than 25. Thankfully we are awesome and it only took us 32 attempts. This really just proves how much better we are than all the other 10 man guilds in the world. Thank you and good night.&quot;</div></div><hr />

One person dies on 10 and it's pretty much a wipe.<br />

I love how they keep blaming wipes on disconnects. it either looks like an excuse or it looks like they all need better connections, because they mention it ALL THE TIME.<br />
<br />
Well they are the best guild in the world, so I'm sure they have players in different parts of the world and thus, a handful of players are likely quite a distance from the server.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astador</div><div class="date">2011-07-24, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never understood people who claim 25 man is more difficult than 10 man. Maybe back in Wrath where there was a lot of damage spread around if you were too close to other people and the encounter areas were smaller. But now? No way. It's simple logic. In 25 man you have more than double the people of a 10 man raid. Are the encounters more than twice as hard on 25 man? No, they aren't. Take Baleroc, for example. There are still only, at most, two tanks required. These tanks take the same amount of damage as they do in 10 man. The only extra damage is the people who have to handle the extra shard. And you've got double the healers (or more) to handle that. Then, of course, you get into the whole idea of raid stacking. The more slots you have available for people, the more you can stack classes you want. A heavy aoe fight? Well, you've got 15-16 spots for dps to play with. 10 man has six. The only fight in this tier that seems like it might be more difficult on 25 man is Rhyolith. The island is rather small with volcanoes being all over the place and whatnot. Still, the ticking damage gets put on what, six people in 25 man as opposed to 3 in 10 man? So you still can out-manage that with extra spots for healers. How about mistakes? The more people you have, the less influential each of those person's mistakes are to the raid. A healer screws up in 10 man and dies, the tank is probably toast. If he isn't, you've wasted your one rez to get them back up. No more major mistakes are allowed from anyone. In 25 man you just keep rezzing people. A healer goes down? Well, you've got 6 others to make up the difference. There's a reason all the guilds do 25-man attempts for world firsts. Because it's easier. Our guild talks day in and day out about how we wish we had enough people to run 25 mans. Why? Because the content (that is already fairly easy) would become a joke and we'd be having purps come out our ears. But nope. We're stuck slogging it out in 10 mans, DEing half the stuff we get and wishing it were better.</div></div><hr />

^ idiot. No one said 10 man was harder or 25 man was easier.

You also have about double the healers a 10 man has, and more than double the mana hymns etc to give your healers more mana, brsoeph. also, 25 man does NOT need to do more dps than a 10 man, just more overall damage, which is ummm obvious considering 25m has about 15ish dps compared to 5 in a 10 man herpderp DPS requirement is the same, and losing 1/5th of the dps is like 3 dps dying on 25m.</div></div><hr />

The fight isn't the same, that's the facts of the matter. They implented their 'overly-complicated' 25-man tactic to 10-man which didn't work and including the disconnects they had I'd say 32 wipes is an ample amount purely for tactic reviews/switches.<br />
<br />
Now if the boss was over-tuned, harder or impossible in any way I'd at least expect and triple digit wipe count around 100-150 if it was so so utterly hard.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is, it wasn't, 10-man people seem to feel the need to exaggerate so much in order to make themselves feel better at raiding the lesser version of raiding.<br />
<br />
You can throw gear around all you want, it's a stupid arguement, you can throw previous experience around all you want but according to you 10-man is way harder and we all know things aren't going to happen the same on 25 as 10 so technically it's not so that being said 32 wipes is purely due to tactics not grinding through the more difficult version of a boss.<br />
<br />
Paragon are the only ones to have experienced and killed both versions, if you don't value their opinion in any way then you're deluded or just plain dumb as they have the most valid say about the issue. I think you 10-manners just need to wake up and stop being so God damn defensive. I wouldn't mind myself tbh if everytime I spoke to a 10-man raider they moaned about balance, tuning and what-not but then still ended up killing the boss even though the way they actually explained it, it would be virtually impossible to beat othe encounter, nuff said.</div></div><hr />

Some encounters are just harder 10m, and some are just harder 25m. I can definitely see Ragnaros being similar to Al'akir, amazingly more difficult 25m. But then there are fights like Nef, H Chim, Alysrazor, etc. that are just harder 10m. Tier 11 seemed to not be very 10m friendly. T12 seems to be very 10m friendly. I think they over adjusted, but that's expected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know the roster and veteran members may be an issue but thinking about this the amount of alts they use and sit-outs available anyway they'd actually probably use mains in places of the 'super-alts' if this were the case or even make two 10-man teams at once for world progression, not too sure about my latter point as maybe in less mature guilds it could create malicious internal guild conflict and animosity but I doubt it would affect a guild such a Paragon, they'd probably want their elite to fill up just one team though and focus on that.<br />

All Paragon are doing is stating their honest opinions from their experience that nobody else currently has, how anybody can disagree or believe they know more on the matter is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

And Baelroc, another way easier one on 10-man grats, Paragon even said themselves the DPS reqs are so much lower, it's actually possible to kill it before Enrage timer on 10-man, AMAZING, let me bow down to your superiority hahahaha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know the roster and veteran members may be an issue but thinking about this the amount of alts they use and sit-outs available anyway they'd actually probably use mains in places of the 'super-alts' if this were the case or even make two 10-man teams at once for world progression, not too sure about my latter point as maybe in less mature guilds it could create malicious internal guild conflict and animosity but I doubt it would affect a guild such a Paragon, they'd probably want their elite to fill up just one team though and focus on that.<br />
<br />
All Paragon are doing is stating their honest opinions from their experience that nobody else currently has, how anybody can disagree or believe they know more on the matter is beyond me.<br />
<br />
10 man is never going to be more prestigious simply because the game officially recognized 25 as more difficult through all of wrath. 10 man heroic LK gave nothing while heroic 25 gave invincible and shadowmourne locket (if u killed him with shadowmourne) Most of the &quot;preemninent&quot; guilds are 25 man for the simple reason that progression in wrath demanded it. You don't let go the majority of the people you work with simply because cata changed the rules of the game somewhat.<br />

You need to read between the lines a little. A 25 man guild that proclaimed they don't do 10 man and never will suddenly decides to bring their &quot;A-team&quot; to 10 mans to &quot;disprove&quot; that 10 man ragnaros is unkillable. Not only are they biased they have a commercial interest in 10 mans not being recognized going forward. It is true they &quot;won&quot; this tier but it is not about this tier it is about any future &quot;Al'Akir&quot; scenario. They are trying to influence blizzard into separating 10 and 25 once again.<br />
<br />
Paragon still has not released the video of either 10 or 25 kill. They are very secretive and trusting secretive people is a sign of naivete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, and you have 3 times the dps that we do, so hard to soak 3 things at once. We saw phase 2 after an hour of attempts <br />
<br />
And Do you know why we got it? because our dps was top notch, and we 1 tank 2 healed it. 25 man you have 40s of people getting slowly slowly slowly one shot by the boss, while still having a large large portion of dps to kill the boss, in 10 man if you go past the enrage timer you last about 10s maybe until the huge majority of your dps are all dead and you cannot do anymore damage.</div></div><hr />

They are very secretive and trusting secretive people is a sign of naivete.It's nothing to do with being secretive...guilds are yet to claim world second, why would Paragon provide videos for these guilds to watch and maybe copy tactics etc and make their own feat of worlds firsts so much before anyone else any less? They'll release the videos AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE DONE after a few others guilds have cleared the last boss.<br />
<br />
And in response to Mizpah, we actually tend to use 6 maybe even 7 healers leaving us with 16-17 DPS which isn't three times 6 DPS to deal with 3 spawns of slowing and 3 sets of broodlings to soak, the co-ordination required is much higher, this is on top of the sheer amount of spinners to get down with taunts/distracts and the extra damage coming out, Fixate is also more of a problem on 25-man due to the constant 3 spawns of spiderlings coming from different directions where on 10-man it's rather trivial as you can move to the other side of the room. Stop being an idiot and coming up with these awful points to try and prove 10-man being harder when it's infact harder, such flawed points, it's unreal you continue to fight your corner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even in bosses that don't have this type of add controlling the 25 man's need to do alot more dps. Also saying that &quot;blowing up stuff&quot; doesnt contribute on a consistant basis is just a fail statement. It's usually more challenging to put off a perfect rotation for some classes and thus maximising your dps to fullest then simply slack a bit but stun the add.</div></div><hr />

Looking at how many times you have posted in this thread explaining to everyone that you are a genius and you have the answers to every boss encounter and how strats should be dealt with,you must be in Paragon! <br />

<br />
Here is straight from the horse's mouth (from paragon website about 10 vs 25):<br />
<br />
&quot;...We strive to be the best PvE guild there is. We put a lot of effort into making that happen. The change of clumping 10-man raiding and 25-man raiding to the same bracket from Blizzard's end complicates this, especially as they officially consider both of the raid settings to be equally hard and they award the same achievements. Despite the fact that in practice the 10-man guilds and 25-man guilds compete in a completely different bracket, there are a lot of people who believe they are truly the same as it's the official stance. <br />
<br />
This system that clumps together the raids poses a lot of problems to us as a guild when we try to reach for the title of the best PvE guild. Do we go for the 10-man raid? Perhaps the last boss there is harder than in 25s? If it isn't, will it be in the next tier? What if we don't go for it, but the 25-man boss is actually so much harder that we don't have a chance of getting a kill, but some 10-man guild actually does have a good shot at getting it down?<br />
<br />
Our only reasonable response is to just focus on the 25-man raids and consider the 10-man bracket as extra. The tuning required to create consistently equally hard boss fights in both brackets would require a ridiculous amount of resources and is very unlikely to happen. So for now, the 10-mans will be something that we can do if we have the time for it after the race in our own bracket. But that's not how everyone views it, simply because of the artificial &quot;10-man = 25-man&quot; decision rewarding the same achievements, same everything and having the official stamp of equal difficulty....&quot;<br />
<br />
To summarize it is exactly what I said: They don't like 10 and 25 rewarding same achievements and it bothers them and impacts them in a negative way. All this is is lobbying. Unfortunately for them, I don't think Blizzard will go back to wrath era because it would make a LOT of people angry. Blizzard lost 600k subscribers it could lose as many if not more if it segregates raiding once more. Why is it so difficult to comprehend that a biased party is not particularly trustworthy.</div></div><hr />

LOL j/k you're just another random bad hunter in another random bad guild that is 2/7 heroic...LOL you're guild is gud brah!I heard guild progression represents the player, maybe it's because I prefer to play with people I like and the external activities apart from raiding, don't pretend to know who I am.<br />
<br />
I couldn't raid 7 days a week for roughly 8 hours+ on each of those days during progress so I've chosen a relatively softcore raid schedule in a guild of which I have many friends with mediocre progress, a guild doesn't always represent the player. I'm quite confident I could be in a world top 50 guild if I really wanted to or was prepared to invest the time, so hop off yea?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">staticflare</div><div class="date">2011-07-24, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Paragon beat 10 man. Who the hell cares? 10 man raiding should have never been added to the game in the first place. 40 man was 1000x more epic in every way. 25 man (While still not as epic as 40) is still a much better raiding experience than 10. Blizzard added 10man raiding for butt hurt raiders who did not want to take the time and strategize 25 or 40 people just to kill a raid boss. Blizzard just dumbed down the game even more so more people could be accessible to the gear. Kara.. one of the best raids in the entire game was a 10man only raid, but it was for a reason, IT WAS THE FIRST RAID IN THE EXPANSION. After that the raids got in-defiantly harder and required much more teamwork and strategic plans to down a boss (Sunwell,Blacktemple,SSC), and therefore were 25 ONLY raids. So in this manner 10man = Much easier,less amount of gear. 25man = much harder,much more gear. They should just remove 10 man all together and give us back our 40 mans.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velerios</div><div class="date">2011-07-24, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">40 man was 1000x more epic in every way.<br />
<br />
LOL, you really didn't raid in Classic: 40 man is not 1000x more epic, it's was only raid with many many people. In 40 man 5 people could walk afk behind the healer and the boss will go down (maybe not in the progress, but after 50th time raiding MC for the 40 spellpower-enchant, bindings for thunderfury and T2-Pants and for the eye of sulfuron you fall asleep). And the most important thing in raids was not the tactic, it's how fast your computer and your internet connection was.<br />
<br />
Yes, it had epic moments, but classic 40man-raids was mostly about lag and farming: farming gold for the repair-bill (no, we didn't had dailys), farming items for temporary buffs (un'goro pylons, jujus, flasks, demonic/dark runes, flasks-item-grinding in the blasted lands. And don't forget to farm items for your fire-resistance-gear; in AQ nature-resistance for huhuran and viscidus and so on.<br />
<br />
So please don't say that 40 man was sooooo epic, it was about grinding, and if you grind enough you shouted if you killed the boss; because you farmed like a berserker.<br />
<br />
And it's clear that Paragon want that 25man give better loot; because if only 25 man gave better loot than 10 man, they don't have so much Competitors for the next tier: People who raid now heroic 10mans could start a 25man-group much easier as when they have to farm 25 normal over and over to get to heroic 25.<br />
<br />
In the last tier 10man was much harder than 25 man: nobody of them said that 25-man-gear should be nerfed, but in this tier, 10 man was easier and they complain about it.<br />
<br />
10 man and 25 man will never be completely balanced, but only because in this tier 10 man-firelands was easier than 25 man, you can't say that 25 man should give better loot than 10 man.</div></div><hr />
