Mists of Pandaria Live Developer Q&amp;A<br />
Q: How will one get to the continent of Pandaria? <br />
A: Players will get to Pandaria via new quests from Orgrimmar and Stormwind. We have tried to make these quests short and sweet to make sure players can into the new continent as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
Q: Any plans to fix pet stats being too low for a few seconds after spawning? <br />
A: We are fixing pets so stats won't lag several seconds after logging in or dismounting in 5.0. <br />
<br />
Q: Currently, it was announced that Monks might not have an auto-attack feature. With the lack of auto-attacks, are there plans on balancing the values for Hit Rating and Haste Rating for a DPS-spec'ed Monk, since one would only need to reach the &quot;soft&quot; hit cap (8%) for specials and Haste Rating will only be affecting their power regeneration and reducing their GCD? <br />
A: Monks will have the same hit cap as e.g. an Arms warrior and their energy regen drives everything they do, so their regen will scale the same as rogues and haste in general will scale their damage by the same percentages. <br />
<br />
Q: At Blizzcon Tom Chilton mentioned possible incentives for raiding enemy towns to encourage world PVP in mists, can Greg or Cory elaborate on this at all? <br />
A: In regards to extra rewards for world pvp, we are contemplating the idea of increasing players conquest point caps by an extra 10-15%. <br />
<br />
Q: With the new talent system, will you start to follow the model in place with Collosus Smash, where a move functions completely differently in PVE and PVP? <br />
A: We don't have a problem with specific mechanics working differently in PvP and PvE. Curse of Doom worked that way for years. Same with PvP durations on debuffs. What we don't want to do is just launch into having different coefficients and talents and everything for PvP and PvE. That just doubles the size of the game which makes it more complex to balance and harder for players to understand. <br />
<br />
Q: Currently in 4.2 as a Balance Druid I have to kill critters before every boss fight so that I start in Solar Eclipse. Is there going to be more critters in MoP or even better, a cooldown that puts us straight into an eclipse? <br />
A: We don't think the answer is more critter spawning in instances. :) We don't have a specific solution we're ready to announce, but we plan to address the problem. <br />
<br />
Q: Where do we level from 85 to 90? <br />
A: You'll leveling on the new continent of Pandaria, of course! ;) <br />
<br />
Q: Hey there. Will Pandaria have a new Dalaran like city or will we be using the ones already existing ingame? <br />
A: We will have separate player hubs for both the Horde and Alliance on Pandaria. Separate hubs means we do not have to make them sanctuary and will encourage world PVP. These hubs will have access to an AH, Bank and general vendors. Valor, conquest, profession and faction vendors will be scattered around the world to encourage travel. <br />
<br />
Q: Will there be more guild levels in MoP, if so how far will the cap go and do you have any examples of new perks? <br />
A: We will be adding new levels to the guild leveling system for Mists of Pandaria. These new levels will come with new perks too! An example of a couple perks we are thinking about are reduced cost on void storage and transmogrification. <br />
<br />
Q: Are you still considering expanding the proposed talent system or is the general form already set? As in, is there still the possibility of get more choice from the new system? (Six overall specializing skills seems quite limiting) <br />
A: We tried a lot of tiers. We were worried at more than 6 that the combinatorial complexity of &gt;729 different variations of talents would be challenging to balance or for players to even comprehend. We want to focus on having fewer awesome talents than many tiers that will force us to dilute individual abilities in the name of balance (for example, if you ended up with 6 forms of crowd control, then all of them need to be pretty weak). <br />
<br />
Q: Where exactly is Pandaria located on Azeroth? many speculate that it is in the south, but I have always assumed it was to the west of Kalimdor. <br />
A: Pandaria is located on the south side of Azeroth. Think the exact opposite of Northrend. Come to think of it, we should have named it Southrend.<br />
<br />
Q: Since we're getting an account wide &quot;pet library&quot; so to speak, do you have any plans to extend this functionality to the mount page? Many players are hanging onto exclusive mounts on older/unplayed characters. <br />
A: We will be testing out account wide features with pet battles and if it proves successful there, we would certainly want to the same thing with mounts. <br />
<br />
Q: Often as an enhancement shaman, I find that weapon drops, specifically agility one handers, are always rare or not made to be slow (I know slow daggers seem pretty odd, but stay with me here). Is there any chance we would be able to reforge swing speeds? <br />
A: We don't want minute differences in weapon speed to have a non-obvious, massive effect. We like daggers being fast and other weapons being slow and will make shaman etc. mechanics work around that. <br />
<br />
Q: During the first discussion on talents, you revealed that Druids would be receiving a fourth talent tree to differentiate between bears and cats. I think this has been mostly received as a positive change by the community. You also stated that the notion of a hybrid tax is an antiquated view on class structure. Are there any plans to provide unique buffs to the four pure DPS classes to compensate for their lack of diversity, or maybe, creating a 4th spec in their areas that would allow for another role, such as a tanking Warlock? <br />
A: We don't want to have unique buffs per DPS spec within a class, but we do want to make sure the DPS specs do offer utility that the tanks and healers can't bring alone. We also want to have greater variety and richness among specs for those classes with multiple DPS specs (e.g. hunter, warrior). We definitely want for there to be a reason to bring pures to a group as well. <br />
<br />
Q: In regards to the Challenge Mode dungeons, how many of the dungeons will offer these modes and will our entire level/stats be reduced to a level equal to lower level dungeons if applicable? <br />
A: We are hoping to have challenge mode dungeons enabled for all 9 of the new Mists of Pandaria dungeons. Assuming we like how it pans out, we would certainly be excited to extend the feature to more classic dungeons or raids. <br />
<br />
Q: With shadow orbs becoming a new resource, do you have any plans to improve the interface to make tracking shadows orbs easier, like what was done with paladins? <br />
A: If you saw the way we handled the monk resource bar at Blizzcon, we are experimenting with doing that for various classes and specs who have resources like that. So we could move shadow orbs down in the middle of the screen for Shadow priests if that paradigm works out. <br />
<br />
Q: Will you consider giving glyphs the same treatment as the talent trees? Glyphs are also somewhat cookie cutter, as passive damage increases are not fun and are mandatory for any player wishing to compete <br />
A: We aren't happy at all with Prime glyphs because they are no-brainers (but often mathy to figure that out). We want to expand the Major glyphs because that is where the real decisions lie. Not sure of the future of Primes quite yet. They *might* go away. (Don't freak, scribes!) <br />
<br />
Q: With MoP you're introducing the pet battles. Will that be a new way of earning XP and/or valor points ? <br />
A: We are hoping to implement XP gain for pet battles in a similar way to what players see with gathering professions now. You would not want to level your entire character just on pet battles, but we do think you should be rewarded for participating in it. <br />
<br />
Q: So with the removal of talent points it seems like players leveling lose their &quot;awesome I just got zealotry&quot; feeling. Though the new talent system seems interesting and unique the gap between each 15 levels makes a dullish feeling in between each gap. Any word on how this will play out? <br />
A: Couple of points. With Ret specifically, we wanted to try and address some of the feedback from players about the rotation. Divine Purpose and Zealotry add too much complication or RNG for some players, which is why we think they make good optional mechanics. Overall, when you see the rate at which you get new spells, you are still rewarded about every other character level (much like today). There are just a lot of core or spec spells that used to be no-brainer talents. <br />
<br />
Q: I think I read somewhere that resilience is becoming a base stat in MoP -- if this is the case, what does that mean for PvP gear and/or does this mean that end game guilds will be top in PvP. <br />
A: Resilience will still be an important stat for competitive PvP. Likewise, PvE gear will still be the best gear for PvE. The hope is to lower the barrier of entry by making the gap smaller (but not trivial). <br />
<br />
Q: One of the current issues discouraging World pvp is the presence of highly overpowered guards around cities and hubs, 1-shotting anyone who engages in PvP. How will this be in MoP? <br />
A: We know this is an issue in the current game and we plan to address it in Mists. We want to encourage world PVP, not make it a one-shot game for NPC guards. This is one of the main reasons we decided to make two separate player hubs instead of a shared sanctuary. <br />
<br />
Q: Will pet battles be created the same way as duels? <br />
A: We will let players duel other players that are near them in the world, but we will also have a queuing system you can join to fight against other pet trainers of similar level. <br />
<br />
Q: I see two new poisons given to rogues in the new talent system, does this indicate we'll be seeing poisons reworked for MoP? As it is the Assassination spec relies so heavily on the instant/deadly combo for damage it's not viable to use anything else. <br />
A: We are reworking poisons. For starters, rogue damage is balanced around the expectation of two damage poisons, which makes it really brutal to use a utility poision instead. In MoP, you will have one damage poison and one utility poison so you can choose which utility poison to use (and not IF you want a utility poison). We also want to reduce the amount of ramping that rogue DPS requires, such as removing the need for Deadly Poison to stack. (And likewise we want to make Bandit's Guile less punitive when swapping targets.) <br />
<br />
Q: Will the pandarian racial that benefits XP bonus give them twice the blue bar for the same amount rested, or will it give you a larger multiplier when receiving XP? <br />
A: Their blue bar (rested XP) will last longer before running out. <br />
<br />
Q: The island of Pandaria is set to be located on the back of a giant turtle, will this turtle go under water? <br />
A: The starting zone for new Pandaren is located on The Wandering Isle (the turtle). The continent of Pandaria itself is not a turtle, its a piece of land. <br />
<br />
Q: Is there any chance of a new spell for paladins to fill the role of Holy Wrath for single target fights? <br />
A: Holy Wrath becomes a nuke for Holy. Ret and Prot will generate Holy Power from Judgment, Exorcism procs, Hammer of Wrath and other abilities that make sense. We still want there to be some small gaps in rhe rotation, but smooth over some of the frustration of today. <br />
<br />
Q: How does the new death knight talent Asphyxiate work at this point? Does it last until the target takes damage, like Repentance or Hex, or is it channeled like the succubus minion's Seduction? <br />
A: Asphyxiate lasts 5 sec. There was a typo in the Blizzcon presentation. Asphyxiate is the same duration as Strangulate, which it replaces. <br />
<br />
Q: What's going to happen to the currently existing Relics once the MoP arrives? will they be turned into gold/grey trash/off-hands/trinkets? <br />
A: Relics will turn into gray items that you can vendor. <br />
<br />
Q: My questions concerns the limits to Pandaren faction chat. How do you intend to deal with if you meet someone at the starting pandaren area and friend each other (not RealID) yet choose seperate factions? <br />
A: Much like the worgen and goblins cannot leave their starting areas, you cannot friend a fellow pandaren until she has chosen her faction. <br />
<br />
Q: At Blizzcon you stated that mage's primary nukes will be spec specific ( Fireball for Fire, Arcane Blast for Arcane, and Frostbolt for Frost). However, what will happen to Frostfire bolt? Currently it is only used by Frost Mages and only when a talent procs. Is this spell going to be reworked or simply removed from the game? <br />
A: Frostfire Bolt is the starting spell at level 1. You get Frostbolt, Fireball or Arcane Blast at level 10. Fire or Arcane can still use Frostfire if they want a snare, or when Brain Freeze procs for Frost. <br />
<br />
Q: I have a question about dungeons... many people have complained that there were not very many dungeons this expansion (compared to the number of dungeons in 1-60 Azeroth, Outland, and even Northrend). In Cataclysm endgame, there were very few normal dungeons for a casual player to easily PuG, and the rest are perhaps a dozen or so heroics (which do get boring after doing the same ones over and over!). Do you plan to have more dungeons come MoP? Will there be more choices for both regular AND heroic versions to have a little something for everyone? <br />
A: We will have 9 normal mode dungeons at launch for Mists of Pandaria. 6 of those will be on Pandaria and 3 will be classic heroics (Scholomance and Scarlet Monastery). All of these dungeons will have a normal, heroic and challenge mode version. We are currently planning to not have any max level, non-heroic dungeons. Most players never found a good niche for dungeons at that tuning level. <br />
<br />
Q: With MoP featuring the battle between the alliance and the horde, can we expect to see more prominent roles or appearances from famous NPCs? <br />
A: Yes, we certainly are. <br />
<br />
Q: Is drain life ,death coil and soul harvest being removed since there are similar talents in it's place? <br />
A: Harvest of Life upgrades Drain Life (Drain Life turns into Harvest, which is a mechanic we use for several spells such as Strangulate -&gt; Asphyxiate and HoJ -&gt; Fist of Justice). Soul Harvest is being removed, but shards passively regen outside of combat or can Drain Soul in combat to replace them. Mortal Coil is the new Death Coil. <br />
<br />
Q: Will there be a system where you can turn pet battles on/off at will? Sometimes I don't want to be pestered by obnoxious pet owners that constantly want to duel. Or perhaps I don't want to get a random encountet while trying to get anywhere. Anyways, will there be an option to switch pet battles off temporarily? <br />
A: We will have an option to disable invites to pet battles. Similar to what we have for player duels. <br />
<br />
Q: The new Cold Snap talent resets Ice Block, Frost Nova, and Water Elemental. I realize that the talents are early, but given that the first two are baseline, might this mean that the Elemental (like Living Bomb) is becoming a core mage spell? <br />
A: Water Elemental is a Frost spec spell. <br />
<br />
Q: How does the new warlock talent that allows you to move while casting, but doubles cast time affect channeled spells? <br />
A: Channeled spells take twice as long to tick after you have started moving with that talent. <br />
<br />
Q: One of the issues with the Outland expansion was that it felt too 'off-worldly'. Northrend resolved this a bit by actually taking place -on- Azeroth, and Cataclysm brought back that wholesome Azerothian nostalgia. How does Pandaria handle this issue, considering how foreign the land (and indeed, the entire Pandaren lore) is to the world? When you're playtesting MoP, how do -you- feel about the land? <br />
A: We are actually working very hard on this specific concept. Pandaria is based on Asian landscapes but its important to remember that these landscapes need to feel like they fit in Azeroth, not the real world. So far, we feel really great about how we are doing on this. Hopefully that was clear to players at BlizzCon as well! <br />
<br />
Q: What place will the World Bosses have in the scheme of raid difficulty and the item level of gear they drop? Will they be a mandatory part of the raiding cycle? <br />
A: We want the world bosses to be optional, kind of like Baradin Hold. <br />
<br />
Q: Are we going to require items to change talents like changing the glyphs? <br />
A: Yes. Our goal (which is more important than the mechanism) is that we don't want swapping talents to be a huge pain, but don't want it to be so easy that making the choice isn't interesting. We don't want players to feel the need to swap talents in 5-player dungeons or for every trash pull in a raid. <br />
<br />
Q: How big are the MoP areas going to be in comparison to say Outlands or Northrend? <br />
A: The zones themselves are quite large, even bigger when you take into consideration that you will not be able to use your flying mount until level 90. If I was to guess, I would say you could imagine the entire continent feeling like all 5 of the Cataclysm 80-85 zones combined. <br />
<br />
Q: Will their be any raid size PvE scenarios? <br />
A: One step at a time, grasshopper. ;D <br />
<br />
Q: Will there be a way for pandaran to switch factions (once) after they choose alliance/horde? Can they defect? <br />
A: We are currently planning for this to be a permanent choice. <br />
<br />
Q: I play Enhance - with 4.3 the cooldown for Wind Shear is going to 26 seconds untalented, with Talents back to 5 Seconds, when MoP comes out those talents are gone. Are there plans to give the 5 second Wind Shear to Enhance as a base skill, or can I kiss my reputation as my Guild's top interrupter goodbye? <br />
A: We want Enhance to still have a frequent interrupt that locks out for less time than other interrupts. However, overall we want to reduce the frequency of interrupts and increase their duration so that when you use them is more of a decision. We want them to be more impactful for both the interrupter and target rather than a spammy nuisance. <br />
<br />
Q: Any plans to rework the crowd control system? Currently fear is not a reliable form of CC unless a glyph is used so they won't move others, like warriors have no real CC at all. Speaking of which, how much CC will be needed in the new dungeons? <br />
A: We're currently exploring ways for Fear to behave more consistently without the glyph, but don't have a precise answer yet. <br />
<br />
Q: Regarding the talent trees, will there be trees as we know them at all? I like the way you guys are moving with talents, but I wasn't sure if combat/assassination/subtlety would exist anymore at all? Using a rogue as an example, will all three trees be merged into 'Rogue' now? It's hard to tell from the examples given. <br />
A: Specs as you know them will still exist. At level 10 you can choose Assassination and get Mutilate. We want the specs (especially for the pure classes) to be more distinct than they are today since some of the signature utility is now available to all members of that class. Specs will contain core rotational mechanics and the tools needed to perform your role. Talents complement that with various forms of utility. <br />
<br />
Q: I don't like PvP, I play on a PvP server, because my friends on a PvP server and most people from my country is playing on that particular server. I have to face world PvP every time I am doing my business in the new hubs in Pandaria? I love the new zone, but I don't want to be backstabbed by a rogue while I am selling my stuff, or buying equipment. Can non-interested players avoid the world PvP <br />
A: Yes, we certainly don't want you to always be back-stabbed while you are setting up your auctions. However, if a group of the opposing faction wants to form a raid and attack your city, we want them to have a chance to be successful. So yes and no. =) <br />
<br />
Q: There seemed to be a bit of a backlash at BlizzCon against the idea of counters in the Pet Battle System. An example would be a water-based pet (Murloc) vs. a fire-based pet (Lil' Ragnaros). This makes the fighting seem a bit more intricate, but I can understand the desire to have Pet Battles be easier to approach. Is there any thought to more than one skill level? <br />
A: We intend to create a simple combat system with some engaging depth. We're still in the process hashing out the details. Suggestions are certainly welcome! ;) <br />
<br />
Q: So far everything I have heard about the expansion sounds too good to be true! I was wondering however - I had heard that Cooking will become a primary skill, but others say I have misheard/read this. But wouldn't it make the Pandaren racial moot if that were the case? Can you clarify? <br />
A: Cooking will remain a secondary skill. We do have some cool stuff planned to match the Pandaren love of cooking. For example, you can choose to specialize in different styles of cooking. For example, grilling may create Strength food. You can choose the specialization that makes the most sense for your character and still unlock feasts at the end, or you can try and learn all specializations. <br />
<br />
Q: What will be the new cap for professions? Do you plan to create any new professions? <br />
A: The new cap for professions is 600 and we are currently not planning to add a new profession. We are hoping that pet battles will offer a fun, new type of activity for players to do that offers an alternative to player power progression. <br />
<br />
Q: Will there be any grasshoppers? <br />
A: Yes! It actually just got checked into the game by the artists today! Going to be awesome to use in pet battles! <br />
<br />
Q: Do you plan on making talent options for each class spec or only 1 set per class. In the preview it seemed that each tier complimented a specific spec rather the class. Also if you believe that talents should be fun choices why put damage dealing spells in the talent options rather then make them only things that increase movement speed, change rotation (ie makes 1 spell faster to cast),.This new system will not kill off cookie cutter builds if things people view as optional are mixed in with abilities. Make abilities base line with spec/leveling and make talents optional increases in power not through damage like the disc priest talent soul warding or rogues improved slice and dice....they both increases possible damage without a direct damage increase. Any comments? <br />
A: The damage-dealing talents aren't core rotational abilities, but situational or utility abilities. When there is a damage option, it should compete against other damage options. The idea is to get away from cookie cutter builds. We don't think there is always a right answer for whether you'd choose to run for longer or more often. Even today, guides will say &quot;choose what you want&quot; for those options. Some talents will probably be better situationally (if the boss can't be interrupted, then your interrupt talent isn't so sexy for that fight), but every e.g. shaman should not have the same talent set at the same time, or our design has failed. <br />
<br />
Q: What will happen to passive abilities like trueshot aura, arcane tactics, improved icy talons and unleashed rage? Where will they go in the new talent system? <br />
A: Many of those become passive abilities you get for your spec. We are removing some of the less interesting buffs and debuffs (+bleed damage, armor, 3% damage, resists are all on the chopping block at the moment). <br />
<br />
Q: At Blizzcon it was mentioned that PvE Scenarios will be something that we will queue for...Will we be required to be in the area that the PvE Scenario will take place in order to queue, or will we be able to queue for them from the cities like we do for the Dungeon Finder. If they are instanced events how will this &quot;get the players out into the world&quot; other than standing around a specific area waiting for the queue to pop, or am I missing the idea? <br />
A: We are planning to only let players queue for scenarios from specific spots in the world (where the scenario is located), not in the cities. We want players out in the world, not spamming the queue button in cities. <br />
<br />
Q: Is there any chance we'll be seeing more weapons with procs? Something akin to thunderfury, sulfuras, or even the Revenge of Kalimdor? <br />
A: Yes, proc weapons are fun. There are several in the 4.3 raid. We will add more. <br />
<br />
Q: What will the pandas ride? non anthropomorphic pandas? <br />
A: We are still working on ideas for their mount. An epic turtle is certainly one of the most popular options around the office right now! <br />
<br />
Q: At Blizzcon you said that demolocks will create demonic fury and turn into a demon when it is maxed out. will this be automatically or will we be able to choose when we use our full demonic fury? <br />
A: You have control over when you transform. The amount of Demonic Fury you have determines the duration of the Metamorphosis. <br />
<br />
Q: Can other people watch the pets battle? <br />
A: We are working really, really hard to have spectating for the pet battles. Trust me, we want it just as bad as you guys. Stay tuned. <br />
<br />
Q: With the world PvP that is being talked about, are there any plans to add any Quest Hubs in Mists of Pandaria which functions like a smaller scale of Baradin Hold/Wintergrasp that will change faction when it is assaulted? Maybe even ones with actual leveling quests instead of just more dailies to add a dynamic questing experience like the ones that were talked about at Blizzcon? <br />
A: Yes, this is exactly the kind of thing we are thinking about. We will share more info on our ideas for this soon. The idea is that we want to give players more options and not just always have one place to go or one thing to do. <br />
<br />
Q: What exactly is a PvE scenario? <br />
A: It's a short, instanced 2-3 player experience without the need for a tank/healer. Think of them as a short series of group quests with a queuing option available. <br />
<br />
Q: It's clear from the consideration and thought you give your answers that you all have a deep understanding of the theory behind MMOs. Is this all knowledge learned on-the-job, or did you have any guidance such as school or peers when making these design decisions? <br />
A: There isn't a lot of formal training that goes into it (though that seems to be improving over time). A lot of it is playing a lot of games, but it helps to have a bunch of really smart dudes on the WoW team (and throughout the company) who can poke holes in what you were certain is a brilliant idea. The guys behind the scenes don't get enough credit for the success of our games. <br />
<br />
Q: Will there be any new underwater zones in MoP? I personally loved Vashj' and would hope that there's at least some mini-zone in the starting area or something. <br />
A: Nope, we are not making another Vashj'ir. Glad you liked it though! =) <br />
<br />
Q: I'm in a high end raiding guild and if the racials for Panderan stay as is, we are almost all going to have to race change. Do you plan to have the Panderan racials (specifically the double food buff) nearly balanced with the other races on release or do you want them to be the best to start with so more people play them? <br />
A: The food buff is the equivalent of racials like the haste or crit buffs of the goblin and worgen. We are still evaluating the power of our primary vs. secondary stats. Primary stats (Agi etc.) are a bit good right now, but that also helps ensure that new tiers of gear are nearly always upgrades.<br />
<br />
Q: Will Arms Warriors do an equal amount of damage when using Bladestorm (lvl 90 talent) as Fury warriors, who have double weapons over arms? <br />
A: We don't want there to be obvious talent decisions. We can make Bladestorm do more damage with two weapons or let Arms do more damage to keep Arms vs. Fury equivalent. <br />
<br />
Q: When do we except this x-pack to come out? (hopefully not late 2012) <br />
A: Based on what we showed at Blizzcon, hopefully sooner rather than later. =) <br />
<br />
Q: Just have to say Blizzard are doing a wicked job with this expansion. It is very hard to hype up an expansion without some epic badass villain. The idea of the raging war between the two factions and the Pandaren being stuck in the middle (somehow trying to find peace?) looks to be so cleverly laid out. So very well done for that. New talent system is one of your best ideas yet. Just one question. How will the story be planned out with no villain, will there be a consecutive story eg every patch will release a raid focusing onto the main raid in the last patch. Or will every patch be unique in terms of story? <br />
A: There are definitely villains in Mists of Pandaria. We just didn't want to put one on the &quot;box cover&quot; so to speak (we don't know what the box looks like yet of course). You have seen some of them, like the mogu. We know who the final boss is. Seriously. It's just too epic to share. Yet.</div></div><hr />

Demonology: 38213 dps<br />
Destro: 37486 dps, 1.9% BEHIND demo<br />
Affli: 37203 dps 2.6% behind demo<br />
<br />
And they nerf the destro mastery? Why, to make sure it's the worse spec?</div></div><hr />

Tyrael's Charger looks like it will be THE most epic priest mount. Ever.<br />

The mount is mailed to each character u have and changes based on ur riding training. So if u train basic riding 60% speed at lvl 20, u can still ride the mount!</div></div><hr />

Oh right, of course &gt;.&lt; well that's cool, but I still don't play my Paladin very much so I fear that I won't see much of it after the initial week or so that I fly around on it on my main, whereas on my pally this would be all I'd ever use :D</div></div><hr />

Those whining about the wings: Get used to it, Look at the direction of the sources of the wings: the mount is built so that the wings extend more vertically towards the back, not towards the side like many of you want. Since it seems that's the appropriate direction for the wings, I'm 90% sure this is the final model before release ^_^, the only thing I see MAYBE changing is the idle wing animation while grounded. Also glad there are some haters. I fully expect this to become one of the most common mounts in the game, at least for a while. Hopefully some players disliking how it looks will mean less people flying around on it :).</div></div><hr />

They asked what people needed more information about, not what they liked the best. Just because people didn't need more information (especially about something that seems pretty straightforward) doesn't mean they don't care or aren't interested. When they did the second poll directly about the pet battles, 57% of people said there were excited about it or would do it, another 22% said they would probably try it out. Only 21% said they weren't interested or didn't like it.</div></div><hr />

Have to agree, worse than some of the questions were the polls. One's like:<br />
<br />
How fantastically awesome are we at blizzard?<br />
<br />
1) Super Awesome!!<br />
2) Super Duper Awesome!!!!<br />
3) I want to have your babies!!!!!<br />
4) I'm a wart on the backside of society for not liking you and plan to kill myself out of shame right after I will all my money to you!!!<br />

<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
-Are there going to be any class specific questlines in MoP?<br />
<br />
-Chris Metzen told us of a Varian's rise to power questline in Blizzcon, is it going to be something leading to Pandaria similar to how Vasjh'ir questline worked out or is it going to be a mid-level experience similar to the one leading up-to Twilight Highlands, or is it going to be 5.0 prequel event? Is there going to be a Horde alternative of such a questline? Or to spice things up is there a possibility of such an alternative being a quest where Horde members under the command of Garrosh try to capture Varian, similar to how SI:7 tried catch Thrall in Goblin questline?<br />
<br />
-Is Azshara(or N’zoth as her master) going to play a role in MoP, or do you reserve Azshara(and/or N’zoth) for a later under-sea based expansion ?<br />
<br />
-Right know there is an ongoing disparity regarding token drops from raids and their distribution to classes, with the addition of Monk class, total number of gear obtained for a single set(e.g chest) of tokens with different set bonuses(22 of them in total), how will the tier tokens are going to be handled, with regards to parting them for classes(e.g Conqueror for Paladin, Priest and Warlocks)?<br />
<br />
-Is there going to be a new primary or secondary profession introduced for MoP?<br />
<br />
-In Blizzcon, it was stated that in MoP Relic slots are going to be removed, following with an addition of visible quivers and librams for Hunters and Paladins respectively. What is going to be modification for Druids, Shaman and Death Knights, if such items are going to be added, are they going to be visible as well?<br />
Seeing how Remorseless became an talented ability, are you going to implement either of; Defile(it was stated in a blue post that it would make up for good level 90 ability), <br />
<br />
-Summon Val’kyr(lore-breaking though) and Soul Reaper? If no what are going to be the new Death Knight abilities learned between 85 and 90? And finally, is there going to be a replacement or an enhancement for Blood Strike(or a newer ability as Festering Strike) implemented in MoP?<br />
<br />
-As all three of Death Knights’ low-tier or base abilities for regenerating their runes have been moved far into level 75, how are you going to address the rune starvation at lower levels?<br />
<br />
-Are you planning to introduce a progression path followed for dungeons similar to the ones in Burning Crusade, as even though it was really frustrating back in the day, introduction of tools like LFD and LFR may solve the main problems regarding the bottleneck of farming them?<br />
<br />
-Are the Scarlet Monastery and Scholomance dungeons going to be reworked similar to how Zul’gurub, Deadmines and Shadowfang Keep was done or are they going to be only tuned for level 90 similar to Zul’aman?<br />
<br />
-Is there going to be a new flying type introduced in Mists of Pandaria?<br />
<br />
-I’m getting frustrated, seeing some Paladin tanks wearing intellect-plate and Restoration Druids wearing agility-leather to cheat their way into heroics. Are you planning to apply changes to detect the item level fraud in LFD(and in LFR)?<br />
<br />
-We get almost zero to none response to our questions and ideas on suggestions EU-forums despite the great activity in US-forums, any chance on migrating Bashiok or Zarhym over to EU-forums?<br />
<br />
-Similar to how Nerubians and Qiraji were, are Mantid descendants of Aqir?<br />
<br />
-So how soon is the Mists of Pandaria beta?<br />
<br />
-Are there going to be secondary stats added to weapon drops from Deathwing’s loot table, or is the procs going to function as the secondary stats?<br />
<br />
-Is there going to be a new raid instance similar to Vault of Archavon and Baradin Hold in MoP?&quot;<br />
<br />

As far as the Q&amp;A was concerned I couldn't agree more with some of the posters here, the majority of questions answered were pet battles and pvp, two of the lowest ranking things in their little poll. I personally asked over a dozen Monk specific questions and didn't get a single one answered.

In the Q&amp;A, his answer was about classes with multiple damage specs, not specifically pures. And I thought it was a reasonable Q&amp;A. By the way, most of the &quot;silly&quot; questions were answered by Zarhym and Bashiok, while more &quot;serious&quot; questions were answered by the developers. Of course, not everyone will have enjoyed the Q&amp;A, but at least they plan on doing these more often, so more times to ask your questions :)</div></div><hr />

Before you judge someone for doing something you should probably read the official news....<br />
If you look on the Q&amp;A the question &quot;Where exactly is Pandaria located on Azeroth? many speculate that it is in the south, but I have always assumed it was to the west of Kalimdor&quot; was asked and the answer was indeed what the other person quoted. The answer also applied to the question that you assumed it did, obviously there was a mistype in recording the questions or copying the information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Q: Where exactly is Pandaria located on Azeroth? many speculate that it is in the south, but I have always assumed it was to the west of Kalimdor. <br />
A: You'll be leveling on the new continent of Pandaria, of course! <br />
<br />
Q: Hey there. Will Pandaria have a new Dalaran like city or will we be using the ones already existing ingame? <br />
A: We will have separate player hubs for both the Horde and Alliance on Pandaria. Separate hubs means we do not have to make them sanctuary and will encourage world PVP. These hubs will have access to an AH, Bank and general vendors. Valor, conquest, profession and faction vendors will be scattered around the world to encourage travel. <br />
<br />
Q: Will there be more guild levels in MoP, if so how far will the cap go and do you have any examples of new perks? <br />
A: We will be adding new levels to the guild leveling system for Mists of Pandaria. These new levels will come with new perks too! An example of a couple perks we are thinking about are reduced cost on void storage and transmogrification. <br />
<br />
Q: Are you still considering expanding the proposed talent system or is the general form already set? As in, is there still the possibility of get more choice from the new system? (Six overall specializing skills seems quite limiting) <br />
A: We tried a lot of tiers. We were worried at more than 6 that the combinatorial complexity of &gt;729 different variations of talents would be challenging to balance or for players to even comprehend. We want to focus on having fewer awesome talents than many tiers that will force us to dilute individual abilities in the name of balance (for example, if you ended up with 6 forms of crowd control, then all of them need to be pretty weak). <br />
<br />
<br />
The question at the top has the wrong answer and the rest of it is a duplication of the part above that question. :s<br />
<br />
The actual answer to the question was somthing along the lines of &quot;It's to the south, if you think of Northrend this island could be called Southrend&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had a few very interesting questions I would of liked to have seen at least one mentioned.<br />
<br />
basically this:<br />
<br />
hunters lose stat sticks and melee weapon options, what happens to fishing rods and items like finkles skinning knife how do we equip those?<br />
<br />
also losing our stat sticks we lose the strong enchants that we have for them, will hunters see scope and ranged weapon enchants that are on par with melee enchants?<br />
<br />
and of course since we lose our stat sticks and mages get wands as a 1H item will we be able to see a sheathed version of wands, bows, xbows and guns on our character models?</div></div><hr />

No..because absolutely every expansion so far has been &quot;the death of WoW&quot;.

Like this is going to be the only Q &amp; A they do.<br />
<br />
It won't be.<br />
<br />
There will be plenty of opportunities to get answers for more of your questions in future Q &amp; As . This was just a trial run. From the sounds of things they're wanting to hold these on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
They kept it kinda general so people could ask any questions they liked rather then be held back with trying to figure out what they wanted to ask , and possibly miss what they wanted to ask.<br />

I have to face world PvP every time I am doing my business in the new hubs in Pandaria? I love the new zone, but I don't want to be backstabbed by a rogue while I am selling my stuff, or buying equipment. Can non-interested players avoid the world PvP A: Yes, we certainly don't want you to always be back-stabbed while you are setting up your auctions. However, if a group of the opposing faction wants to form a raid and attack your city, we want them to have a chance to be successful. So yes and no. =)&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
i think that if they actually gave incentive to players to repel enemy faction raids into their towns more people would take up the fight. as it is now if horde raid stormwind on my server no one cares. admittedly i don't much care either, because there is nothing to gain by fighting them, and nothing to lose if they are successful. most of the time it's just them sitting in trade district waiting for the 1 or 2 alliance players to either come out of a BG flagged, or be stupid enough to attack them when it's 20 to 1. at most it's just an annoyance, and i just go to IF to take care of whatever business i need to take care of.</div></div><hr />

Feel like they're trying to get the same look as Tyrael's wings. They never really looked like wings, more like tendrils. Still, they do not look completely finished so they might be changed.

A: You'll leveling on the new continent of Pandaria, of course! <br />
<br />
Q: Hey there. Will Pandaria have a new Dalaran like city or will we be using the ones already existing ingame? <br />
A: We will have separate player hubs for both the Horde and Alliance on Pandaria. Separate hubs means we do not have to make them sanctuary and will encourage world PVP. These hubs will have access to an AH, Bank and general vendors. Valor, conquest, profession and faction vendors will be scattered around the world to encourage travel. <br />
<br />
Q: Will there be more guild levels in MoP, if so how far will the cap go and do you have any examples of new perks? <br />
A: We will be adding new levels to the guild leveling system for Mists of Pandaria. These new levels will come with new perks too! An example of a couple perks we are thinking about are reduced cost on void storage and transmogrification. <br />
<br />
Q: Are you still considering expanding the proposed talent system or is the general form already set? As in, is there still the possibility of get more choice from the new system? (Six overall specializing skills seems quite limiting) <br />
A: We tried a lot of tiers. We were worried at more than 6 that the combinatorial complexity of &gt;729 different variations of talents would be challenging to balance or for players to even comprehend. We want to focus on having fewer awesome talents than many tiers that will force us to dilute individual abilities in the name of balance (for example, if you ended up with 6 forms of crowd control, then all of them need to be pretty weak). <br />

LoL. More world PVP? How about fixing the realm balancing mess first so that servers aren't 10:1 or even 20:1?

I don't like that they are offering those things by the store and not in game, I bought both since I am a mount collector but I don't hate people who are using them.

That is also the only reasonable solution i can see to solve the whole faction balance issue.

Except there will never be class only mounts released in the future. thats too bad. although paladins and warlocks have mounts noone else can get. I see no problem with class specific mounts. it makes people stand out more. same for each profession should have a mount all their own. BS should be able to make a metal horse or metal mammoth. think mechanical yeti but a BS version. tailors get a mount. why not other professions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had a few very interesting questions I would of liked to have seen at least one mentioned.<br />
<br />
basically this:<br />
<br />
hunters lose stat sticks and melee weapon options, what happens to fishing rods and items like finkles skinning knife how do we equip those?<br />
<br />
also losing our stat sticks we lose the strong enchants that we have for them, will hunters see scope and ranged weapon enchants that are on par with melee enchants?<br />
<br />
and of course since we lose our stat sticks and mages get wands as a 1H item will we be able to see a sheathed version of wands, bows, xbows and guns on our character models?<br />
<br />
I recall during Blizzcon, they said that the hunters ranged weapon would now be classed as a 'main hand weapon' so logically it would be most likely that enchants for agi etc will be re-worked so they can be used on bows/guns and/or new scopes will be announced that will give an equivilant enchant.<br />
<br />
As for enchant looks (some people love glowy shit) a glowing bow with bits flying off it could look quite pro :D<br />
<br />
As for the skinning knife, you'll probably lose the ability to use it (like they said old weapons will not be able to be used for transmog etc).</div></div><hr />

The guy on a PvP realm being back stabbed when doing his auctions should have been told that he can turn off PvP in cities even on a PvP realm. <br />
<br />
And most importantly, Blizzard doesn't even dare to guess they are going to release the expansion earlier than &quot;late 2012&quot; so there we have (late) fall release once again.<br />
<br />
And the mount is extremely pathetic... You might want them to make better wings but imagine this horse with real wings, that's even worse.</div></div><hr />

Currently primary stat is always &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; secondary stats for dps/healing classes (tanks often put secondary stats first because they often don't have a primary stat that is worthwhile to them). I know they like to think that they are the same because they said so but math doesn't agree. Primary stats give multiple increases. Int gives spell power, crit, bigger mana pool that leads to more regen. Agi gives Attack power, crit etc. Secondary stats only give a bonus to whatever that stat is. The nonsense response confirmed to me that they know exactly what they are doing. Trying to extort race changes from min/max raiders that jump to whatever the best racial is. That food buff racial is nothing more than a cash grab.</div></div><hr />

They announced the feature last week, without going into details that much, and you already say it's boring. Did you try the feature and got to the conclusion it's horrible? <br />
<br />
That isn't the final model of the charger people. Boub said in his news post that it uses the firehawk's wings. And indeed it looks kinda awkward the way it is now.<br />
<br />
I don't know why the Q&amp;A team bother to answer stupid questions really... <br />

Can hardly wait to see all the lore from MoP, the raid bosses and how exactly they're gonna focus on world pvp.<br />

It is very hard to hype up an expansion without some epic badass villain. The idea of the raging war between the two factions and the Pandaren being stuck in the middle (somehow trying to find peace?) looks to be so cleverly laid out. So very well done for that. New talent system is one of your best ideas yet. Just one question. How will the story be planned out with no villain, will there be a consecutive story eg every patch will release a raid focusing onto the main raid in the last patch. Or will every patch be unique in terms of story? <br />
A: There are definitely villains in Mists of Pandaria. We just didn't want to put one on the &quot;box cover&quot; so to speak (we don't know what the box looks like yet of course). You have seen some of them, like the mogu. We know who the final boss is. Seriously. It's just too epic to share. Yet.<br />

How can they control which factions people want to play? This is a player-driven problem, not a Blizzard-driven problem.<br />

The only reasonable solution is to start merging servers.<br />
I don't see Blizzard merging servers anytime soon. It'd probably be too embarrassing to admit that they wasted a bunch of money on hardware and man-hours only to end up with sparse use.</div></div><hr />

Server merges also cuts off a revenue stream for them with server transfers. Makes them look like the game is in decline which is bad for shareholders and will never happen until the population shrinks by quite a bit. Lets face it, if there are things in this game that make blizzard money they will never add a free feature that takes that away, it will be monetized. I know of people who server transferred with BoA gear and then transferred back. Thats why we wont ever see BoA gear being mailed to other servers. Not because its hard to do. Hell your character is temporarily placed on a different server every time you do a raid/dungeon. How hard is it to send a piece of mail?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So glad you posted that, haha i typed out something similar then chrome died on me and i didnt feel like retyping. But dont forget they already have a system in place which could be used for sending BoA gear to other toons on separate servers. All they'd have to do is utilize the same exact system used for blizzstore purchases. You buy something on a specific toon, say the leather spell shoulders for this example. it &quot;flags&quot; your account that you have it. Then anytime you create a toon who can use spell leathers its auto sent to them. Wouldnt be difficult at all. But like you said, blizz is greedy... and they suffer for it. When I was still subscribing to the game.. I paid the subscription to have access to everything not to be ruled by micro transactions.</div></div><hr />

A: Players will get to Pandaria via new quests from Orgrimmar and Stormwind. We have tried to make these quests short and sweet to make sure players can into the new continent as fast as possible.So they haven't learned anything from every other xpac? We're just going to unleash everyone onto the the new starter zone at once and a) overload it b) have people be maxxed in 24 hours?Why not make it a timed and / or zoned access. In order to gain access to Pandaria you'd have to have a certain rep or have a certain item(s). This would significantly reduce the amount of players in one place and prolong the experience. :mad: :( :confused: :o</div></div><hr />

They said epic. Maiev is hardly that important of a character.<br />
<br />
They go for serious major badasses as end villians. The only thing that makes sense at this point is Sargeras, and probably some involvement with Kil'jaeden. The Burning Legion benefits most by having the Horde and Alliance go after each other, since for one reason or another, they've got a hardon for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
(And go ahead, tell me Sargeras is dead... like that's ever stopped Blizzard before)</div></div><hr />

I'm one of those people that likes to collect old sets of gear. I have every single hunter tier with the exception of T3...and I'm a completionist, so my sets include the matching pieces like belts and boots (for the 5-piece tiers) and cloaks and weapons. Something that concerns me greatly is the announcement that hunters will no longer use melee weapons come MoP (along with getting rid of relics, wands becoming main hand items, etc.). Is this going to mean that the melee weapon slots on the character panel are just going to disappear, or will the slots remain but just not be able to have an item higher than a certain level equipped in them, or will items equipped in those slots just not contribute any stats to a character? I see all three being things that could be done, but the first option is one that would be greatly upsetting if it's what's planned to be implemented. Will I no longer be able to equip and show off the Thunderfury that I spent so much time devotedly farming MC for *years* to finally get? What about melee weapons acquired to go with other sets a player just happens to think looks cool (for example, the star daggers from Ulduar look really cool with the original Priest Dungeon Set 1).</div></div><hr />
