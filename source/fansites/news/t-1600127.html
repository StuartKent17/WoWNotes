With Patch 6.0.2 only a couple of weeks away, now is the time to finish up the Brawler's Guild! Our friends at Icy Veins have a handy guide (http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/brawlers-guild-guide) to help.<br />
<br />
A few changes aren't mentioned in the post, such as the new potions (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Brawler+draenic) being added or the removal of Brawler's Bladed Claws (http://www.wowdb.com/items/93858-brawlers-bladed-claws).<br />
You’ve been beaten and bloodied, laser beamed and chomped, and you’ve certainly earned the opportunity to take a breather. The current season of Brawler’s Guild is coming to a close once Patch 6.0.2 goes live, but you’ll be back in action before you know it. Here’s what you can look forward to as we get ready to launch Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/september/thumb/bg01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/september/bg01.jpg) <br />
<br />
First, all members of the Brawler’s Guild will keep their membership after the patch goes live, so don’t worry about having to rejoin. For those who still seek to join the Brawler’s Guild, you’ll have some opportunities to find a Blood-Soaked Invitation once you arrive on Draenor.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few changes, so let’s break ’em down:<br />
<br />
<br />
All Brawler’s Guild achievements earned prior to Patch 6.0.2—Season One—will become legacy achievements (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/character/legacy?filter-search=brawl). New achievements for Season Two (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/character/world-events/brawlers-guild) will take their place.<br />
Rewards earned based on progression will remain available for purchase. The ring reward (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/118907-pit-fighters-punching-ring) will be updated in Patch 6.0.2 so that it will have valuable stats for all specializations.<br />
The next patch will introduce boss encounters that will be adjusted for level 100 members.<br />
Progression has been reverted back to 8 tiers.<br />
Bosses that are being removed from previous tiers will be added to the challenge card vendor and become available as you progress.<br />
All tiers have had their boss line-ups remixed—for example, Bruce is now a rank 5 boss instead of rank 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/september/thumb/bg02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/september/bg02.jpg) <br />
<br />
While we won’t be adding new bosses or challenge cards, you will be able to take Meatball (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/followers/203-meatball-meatball) back to your Garrison as a new follower—that is, once you’ve defeated him. As for the future, who knows what developments Bizmo and Boss Bazzelflange might have planned? For now, get in there, rough up a few bad guys, and get ready for Brawler’s Guild to come back with a vengeance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, some of the lower tier bosses actually have quite interesting mechanics. But they are so easy that they are rarely noticed. Vian the Volatile (http://wowpedia.org/Vian_the_Volatile), which is currently the second fight on rank 1, could prove to be quite hard if he appears later on. The same goes for Kirrawk (http://wowpedia.org/Kirrawk) (Rank 2, fight 2) and Sanoriak (http://wowpedia.org/Sanoriak) (Rank 3, fight 2). I must admit, even if there are no new bosses, I am actually looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />

I can't advance past him because he ignores his own &quot;rules&quot; and pauses for no discernible reason--presumably just to sit in one of his own spit puddles, roid out pummel me.<br />
<br />
I've been stuck on him for months simply because, despite staying within range, backpedaling on walk instead of run and all those other guidelines for defeating him, he will still bug out and bulk up--often before I've even made it to the first turn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too much work for content that would only be there for 4 weeks, the time between the pre patch and WoD launch. After that these things will get re-booted for level 100 anyway. Blizzard tries not to repeat the mistake they made with Crusader's Colosseum for example, creating a giant heap of content that is never revisited again once the level cap is raised. Instead they are now making challenging content that grows as the game grows, and will never be outdated or overgeared. The alternative solution would be to discontinue these features.<br />
<br />
Quite reasonable, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

Ah, of course . Blizzard lazyness strike again. <br />
Why do new content ? Better cancel and remove it. <br />

And eventually ask more money for less content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not the least bit suprising that they havent made new bosses yet. Do you really think new bosses for brawlers club is worth postponing the expansion?`<br />
<br />
I love brawlers club, but new bosses for it is something they can allways add whenever they feel like it. It shouldnt take time from the release of the expansion thats for damn sure<br />

They have only once removed an item from someone who obtained it and that was a legendary item from Molten core that was not supposed to be obtainable.<br />
<br />
Thats the only time blizzard has ever removed an item that has been obtained legally.<br />

I doubt VERY much they will start now<br />

I'm pretty sure they'll just be unobtainable for a while because every other Justice Heirloom will be as well.<br />

That's the thing, he is not equal to everyone. If your computer or network connection sucks, the boss, I imagine, is nearly impossible.<br />

Yeah that guy is such an a hole, gone from wiping within seconds of starting to lagging when the berserk fire appears to dieing right after i kill him and if that's not enough they make you wait in a 20-40minute queue between each wipe :S Was so happy when i killed him and realised i never had to see his stupid little eye ever again :S</div></div><hr />

It looks like they are adding a new one to the vendor. <br />
<br />
<br />
The removal of the heirloom fists, do people who bought them lose them or are they just going to be no longer obtainable?<br />

Most likely just not on the vendor anymore. Removal of items you already earned is fairly rare.</div></div><hr />

Because there is nothing else to talk about. The only new feature in WoD is garrisons.

They are probably gonna add more bosses later on, since the feature hasn't been very much used and for a majority of people who do the bosses they defeat them only once i'd say that new bosses is a pretty low priority atm.<br />

Anyway, theres a few things that AREN'T mentioned atm.<br />
<br />
Mount- It currently requires rank 10. Will it require rank 8 come WoD? Or is that removed?<br />
<br />
Shirt cards- Will you be able to redo them come WoD? or are those removed?<br />
<br />
Brawler Title- Removed? Kept? New title come WoD?<br />
<br />
Do we STILL get !@#$ing passes for getting rank 7/9? I got like 2 dozen of those sitting in my bags from where i go up to Hexos on all my alt for the 4k gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love brawlers club, but new bosses for it is something they can allways add whenever they feel like it. It shouldnt take time from the release of the expansion thats for damn sure<br />
<br />
^ This.<br />
<br />
As much as I would love new bosses, one must realize they already have so much to work on for WoD's release. Personally I'll probably do them all again, as most of them I just breezed through dying 0 to 1 or 2 times. The mixed order will make some bland bosses a bit harder and more entertaining, defenitely fresh enough for me to go back.<br />
<br />
It's not like we've been killing the same exact bosses every week in Brawler's Guild for the past year =P I killed most only once and never saw them again, it's not as good as new bosses, but defenitely not that bad, chill out :)</div></div><hr />

That's the thing, he is not equal to everyone. If your computer or network connection sucks, the boss, I imagine, is nearly impossible.<br />

<br />
What does concern me, though, is that a lot of the existing bosses are going to become even more terribly imbalanced and frustrating for several of the ranged classes with the WoD class changes. I'm going to cross my fingers that the devs account for this with season 2, but I worry that some of the design flaws from season 1 will end up being exacerbated rather than improved upon.</div></div><hr />

They are removing the valor part of the legendary questline. Not sure how long you need to do the rest with the buff and if you do LFR + flex + normal + heroic (Or however many difficulties you can get quest items from), but leaving one month for that entire part seems reasonable. Anything less seems less reasonable. That is my line of thinking at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blargh, I really hope they rework him too. Nibbleh isn't even any more of a mechanically challenging fight than most of the other bosses, he's just brokenly designed and almost entirely subject to uncontrollable RNG, based on the limitations of the WoW engine in regards to mob pathing and hitboxes (plus his spit having no minimum range &gt;.&gt;).</div></div><hr />

It takes practise but after you learn it it gets easier to do it again.<br />
<br />
You likely play one of those classes that can do a blind 3 button circle click. It's a whole lot harder when you have 5 spells, 3 dots with different durations and on top of that cooldowns and proccs. That boss is definitely not equal to everyone...connection-problems on top of that. Many that play a more challenging class use 2 players to defeat Hexos...</div></div><hr />

As stated by others before, he is not equal. Besides one's latency, Hexos is arguably the toughest out of all the Brawler bosses, the specials included. He should never have been required for progression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hm thats a good reminder that I have to max my archaeology for the last bonus boss, duh. :(<br />
<br />
I wish you good luck, then. It's fortunately that players can farm mogu and pandaren digsites for completed solves, then turn those in to Brann Bronzebeard (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/64922-brann-bronzebeard) for Crate of Tol'vir Archaeology Fragments (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87539-crate-of-tolvir-archaeology-fragments), which has a 3% chance of containing Digmaster's Earthblade (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97986-digmasters-earthblade)... which sadly is the better route than trying to farm Tol'vir dig sites. <br />
<br />
<br />
They have only once removed an item from someone who obtained it and that was a legendary item from Molten core that was not supposed to be obtainable.<br />
<br />
Thats the only time blizzard has ever removed an item that has been obtained legally.<br />
<br />
I doubt VERY much they will start now<br />
This is incorrect. The item you are referring to is Talisman of Binding Shard (http://wowpedia.org/Talisman_of_Binding_Shard), and Noktyn &lt;Nurfed&gt; (the guild he was a member of at the time) was allowed to keep it. See http://www.wowprogress.com/character/us/blackrock/Savorx , check under the equipped gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do the MMO news keep linking to wowdb for all items and NPCs? Serious question here, because it always has very little information.<br />
<br />
I'll simply quote from Bibi:<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope, just full nope. <br />
<br />
Wowdb was created to replace db.mmo-champion.com which was created because Wowhead refused to work with us years ago and we needed it to run MMO-Champion. There is absolutely no way for a company as big as Wowhead/Zam/Tencent Games to work with MMO-Champion in the first place because it would require us to have access to absolutely everything they have, which is a pretty good reason to refuse.<br />
<br />
The first goal was to provide better content on MMO-Champion compared to what we had with db.mmo-champion.com and we achieved that goal pretty easily. It also brought some competition back to the market and improved things indirectly for everyone, including people who use Wowhead. Competition is always good. <br />
<br />
WoWDB is mostly a &quot;hey let's see what we can do with this&quot; project with no real goal. It's a 100% money sink for the company and even if we added an ad slot somewhere it would still be a pretty huge money loss. The main goal is really just to support MMO-Champion's news and make our life easier on this side. <br />
<br />
However, I'm glad that some people/other major sites adopted it because it lets me work with smart minds that provide us with a decent amount of feedback and let us improve our database platform altogether (contributing to the success of gw2db.com for example) but I'm not really on a crusade to destroy Wowhead, otherwise I wouldn't have them listed as the most obvious link on every page you click.<br />
<br />
I can answer that one!<br />
<br />
WoWDB is used to power most of what's behind MMO-Champion's news. It replaced db.mmo-champion.com that was becoming super obsolete and wouldn't have survived MoP. It's also a way to try to improve user experience on MMO-C over db.mmo-champion.com pages we had because those were pretty bad.<br />
<br />
It's a technological sandbox to let us improve the database platform on a company level. The improvements on wowdb are partially the reason why gw2db was more succesful than other databases for example. <br />
<br />
The original reason why MMO-C had to create a DB was already mentioned in the thread, Wowhead got too big to be able to work with us and we were stuck with the choice of either doing our own thing, or posting really shitty news. The amount of data processing that goes into patch news requires way too much access than what we could have gotten from another company. <br />
<br />
Some people also mentioned that competition is good, and I tend to agree with that. WoWDB was the first database to support a bunch of things such as spec variable spells or item upgrades. We also focus a lot more on newsing, so our spell parsing tends to be much cleaner to keep the unofficial notes clear: http://www.wowhead.com/spell=100780/jab / http://www.wowdb.com/spells/100780-jab<br />
<br />
We also have random features like reagents breakdown http://www.wowdb.com/spells/93328-vial-of-the-sands<br />
<br />
The goal isn't really to compete with Wowhead, it's more of a pet project to see if we can find new ways to improve MMO-C and make the experience more enjoyable for users with what we have.</div></div><hr />

I generally think people are being hyperbolic with statements like this, but after the new the Brawler's guild news, I sort of agree. (And yes, I know they will probably add more to it in 6.1 or on, as they did in MoP!) I mean, I'm happy with a lot of stuff they're doing, but realistically, they're not doing a lot in some ways. I'd say that perhaps it's the re-do of all the models - since they've always said it would take a lot of time and work - but then, they also say 'Different teams do different things' so it seems counterintuitive to then say 'Redoing the models took all of our time, money, and resources!' - I think they're rushing because for whatever reason, adding all of these 'new' people to the team has really dragged them down for whatever reason. <br />
<br />
WoD has some good stuff to it, and I am looking forward to some elements. Other parts of it feel really oddly lacking, comparatively. That said, I've kind of curbed my beta experience so I can enjoy it when it's all finished, so I may change my tune. Some of it, for me, may be that Draenor is not particularly interesting to me, though a throwback to WC2 is neat with the various chieftains. However, nostalgia only goes so far.. and killing them off more easily also doesn't entirely sit well - at least make them some instance bosses! - etc. In the end, if it's pretty barebones, that's fine, as long as it doesn't sit there for ages.. and if it is barebones, it doesn't justify the larger pricetag.</div></div><hr />

As someone did point out, more than likely, in 6.1 or something, we'll get more because the Guild wasn't even introduced until 5.1.. so hopefully we'll get some new bosses and such then. It's still a bit lame though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope they'll keep going with interesting mechanics like this one, but then again they've started catering to crybabies once and will probably keep doing so.<br />
I never said that Hexos shouldn't have been challenging. I only stated that his mechanic was problematic and that the difficulty curve was misaligned.</div></div><hr />

I didn't mind any of them, save Nibbleh and Hexos. And it's better then Brawlers guild becoming completely irrelevant once WoD hits, so that's nice, I guess.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing you won't if you beat them in season 1? Could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />

Besides one's latency, Hexos is arguably the toughest out of all the Brawler bosses, the specials included. He should never have been required for progression.<br />
<br />
I really don't want do offend you, but I have a very different opinion about Hexos.<br />
<br />
I was among the first people to beat both the very first version of Brawlers Guild as well as the updated one. I mention this, to give an impression of the gear I used/was available to me.<br />
While I died NUMEROUS times on Disruptron (took more time than all the other bosses combined: 12hrs for everything else, another 16hrs for disruptron), I killed Hexos about 20 times when he was new, just to show off, and NEVER died, not even when I tried it the first time. I saw somebody else die to hexos, came up to him myself and oneshotted him. To this day I think he is one of the easiest bosses in brawlers guild, since you just need to meet that berserk timer, while turning him around. The most important part, which many players seemingly don't get, is the fact that you have to avoid the boss from touching the pink obstacles, not your own character. It is absolutely irrelevant where your character faces when those pink things hit you, it's only about hexos never touching them.<br />
<br />
A properly tuned Disruptron that is brought up to current gear levels in terms of damage output and health, meaning a very tight enrage AND pretty much everything oneshotting you, would give players MUCH more trouble than hexos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So disappointing, Brawler's Guild was an excellent pass time.<br />
<br />
So damn lazy, especially when they just copy paste bosses or npcs and change mechanics anyway, this is one of the easiest development effort to content amount possible, and they ignore it.<br />
<br />
If they wanted to do the very minimum they could of copy pasted bosses straight from dungeons and overcharged them or add a new mechanic to them thats a mechanic from a different fight, requires zero creativity to do.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liliannan</div><div class="date">2014-09-30, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hexos was not challenging for me. Beat him on my third try. If I can do it with 250-300ms average as an Aussie playing on a US Central server, then you guys can do it too! Just spam a couple of your biggest damage dealing abilities and focus on the turning. As long as you are doing 100k+ dps you will defeat him no problem.<br />
<br />
I did however have a problem with Nibbleh!! I almost gave up on him. He kept stalling and would then gain his buff and one shot me. So incredibly frustrating. Eventually after a couple glasses of wine I finally beat him when RNG was in my favour.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Patife17</div><div class="date">2014-09-30, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hexxos can be easy if you have good gear ofc.<br />
<br />
While trying Hexxos I saw couple people saying &quot;it was easy&quot; &quot;did it in 3 tries&quot;, then you inspect them and they have full hc gear or close to it rofl. Ofc its easy with that kinda o gear. You kill him in like 30secs pfff. Try focus for 2-3min.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just stating the obvious but gear makes alot of diference.<br />
I got stuck in rank 6 when at ilvl 480 or so, then geared up a bit to ilvl500 made it to hexxos a quit at that time. Then tried again about 1 month ago with 522pvp fully hit\exp and optimized with 544 wep but wiped like 20 times. 5 of them at 25%. not that bad. but then it went to 20 queue line which sucks big time. Sub ran out that day and havent played since. looking forward to not meet hexxos at 100 :p. Bad boss design IMO, latency can also screw you up big time. Other bosses I found them quite doable with low gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree with this. I tend to give Blizzard the benefit of the doubt on development time, but I'm pretty annoyed at time this xpac is taking considering the actual new content we are getting. Haven't pre-purchased and still on the fence. I would have rather they retired Brawler's Guild until they could develop new fights rather than just shuffling the boss order and retuning it. Very disappointing.</div></div><hr />
