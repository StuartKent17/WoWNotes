Epic gems available for 15 Badges from the Sunwell Isle Vendor<br />
US-Proudmoore (http://us.gorgonnash.info/realm/Proudmoore) just completed the last phase of the Shattered Sun Offensive and can now buy all the epic gems from the vendor for ... 15 Badges !

Recruiting a Friend ... more interesting in the future ?<br />
If you've been playing WoW for some time, You probably noticed at some point the option to &quot;Recruit a friend&quot; on your account management page, or even used it. According to the changes made to some files listing error messages in the game, it looks like you will soon be able to have a few more options to help your friends in game, like summoning them or even ... granting them a level ? <br />
<br />
Of course, nothing is official yet, and it's possible that we'll never see that in game. <br />
<br />
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_DIFFERENT_FACTION = &quot;You cannot grant levels to a character of the opposite faction.&quot;; <br />
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_GRANT_LEVEL_MAX_I = &quot;You cannot grant levels to players level %d or higher.&quot;; <br />
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_INSUFFICIENT_GRANTABLE_LEVELS = &quot;You have not earned enough levels to grant any more levels.&quot;; <br />
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_NOT_NOW = &quot;You cannot grant that player a level right now.&quot;; <br />
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_NOT_REFERRED_BY = &quot;You were not referred by that player.&quot;; <br />
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_SUMMON_COOLDOWN = &quot;You can only summon your friend once per hour.&quot;; <br />
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_SUMMON_LEVEL_MAX_I = &quot;You cannot summon players above level %d.&quot;; <br />
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_TARGET_TOO_HIGH = &quot;That player's level is too high.&quot;; <br />
ERR_REFER_A_FRIEND_TOO_FAR = &quot;That player is too far away.&quot;; <br />
FACTION_STANDING_INCREASED_BONUS = &quot;Reputation with %s increased by %d. (+%.1f Refer-A-Friend bonus)&quot;;<br />
<br />
<br />

Blacksmithing BOP Weapons Dual-wieldable in 2.4.2<br />
Blacksmiths are probably going to be happy, all their BOP Weapons have been changed and aren't unique anymore ! That's a nice change alone, but if you took the time to read the 2.4.2 Patch Notes you probably remember seeing something mentioning Main Hand weapons changed to One-Hand .... Well that's the case here, you can now dual-wield them (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/bopblacksmith.jpg) !<br />

Twin Eredars reverse kill videos<br />
As mentionned last week (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=6523.0), killing Lady Sacrolash first during the Twin Eredar encounters rewards the raid with one more epic loot and 4 sunmotes. It didn't take long before we saw some videos of the encounter released publicly. <br />
<br />
The first video is from Vortex (http://www.clan-vortex.com/), the 2nd one from Fusion (http://www.fusion-guild.org/), and the last one from Vodka (http://www.vodka-guild.net/)<br />

<br />
<br />
It stacks, no internal cooldown. It's simply to completely unrelated Dragonstrike procs.<br />

Agreed it would be very out of character, interesting nonetheless though</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty if the haste buff stacks once it goes live DW Dragonstrike will be prolly be the norm for all enhancement shamans/furywarriors even if they have S3 or higher weapons</div></div><hr />

Looking at the screenshot it doesn't look like it; but does one have to have SSO rep to buy the epic gems with heroic badges?</div></div><hr />

Well... rogues with Blacksmithing shouldn't be treated differently, now should they?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Knowing Blizzard it will really be what it looks like it is, because letting you level alts quickly would be too good, they have to turn it into a money-making scheme (INVITE YOUR FRIENDS AND YOU CAN LEVEL THEM FAST... btw if you just invite your &quot;friend&quot; and it turns out to be you on a separate account giving your new character free levels, we don't care, just give us $$).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Those that doesnt PvP, might be interested. I know im one. :D<br />
<br />
.....And with the amount of dailies and the relative easyness of getting gold, making another Dragonstrike is a lot faster then getting the rating and arenapoints for an s3 weapon.</div></div><hr />
