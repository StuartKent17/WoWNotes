Challenge Mode Dungeons<br />
<br />
Heroic mode dungeons will not be as difficult as they were in Cataclysm, instead they will be similar to the Wrath of the Lich King level difficulty. <br />
Challenge Mode dungeons will require you to complete a dungeon in a certain amount of time to win a medal and other rewards, similar to the Zul'Aman timed run for the bear mount.<br />
There are Bronze, Silver, Gold medals that will be earned based on the amount of time taken to complete the dungeon.<br />
You gear levels are normalized by reducing your overall item level to a set level so that everyone is on equal gear footing.<br />
There will be no way to get better gear and just overpower the challenge. <br />
Completing the Challenge on gold will incur a stacking debuff on future attempts: it’ll start with a 5% debuff, but if you manage to finish with a gold medal time on that run you’ll receive a 10% debuff on your next run, and so on.<br />
The challenges will reward unique gear for transmogrification and valor points. <br />
Other possible rewards include pets, mounts, titles, and achievements depending on your score. <br />
A new challenge dungeons UI will be added, allowing you to check your medals, ranking, show what rewards you can unlock, and more.<br />
There will be realm wide leaderboards that allow you to compete with your friends, guild, or everyone!<br />
Challenge Mode will work only on Pandaria dungeons at the beginning.<br />
Challenge Mode dungeons will use the Dungeon Finder tool.<br />
It is possible that the system could be expanded to raids in the future.<br />
<br />

Class Transmogrification List<br />
With the popularity of our previous weapon transmogrification list (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1051669-Heroic-Madness-of-Deathwing-Video-Weapon-Transmogrification-Happy-Holidays!), we have expanded the list to more slots for each class. Because these lists are so long and take some time to prepare, the lists will be split into groups of a few classes at a time. Today we finish with Shaman and Hunters. If you would like to see other transmogrification data, let us know in the comments.<br />
<br />
This time around items that share the same model and color are counted together in the rankings as often as possible, but not items that have different color variations of the same model. <br />
<br />
All of the items in the list have screenshots on the database page if you are looking for some transmogrification ideas!<br />

Probably because a large portion of the player base complains about dungeons being too hard, while another complains about them being too easy.<br />
<br />
Perhaps with challenge mode dungeons and heroics back to easy, they can appease both sets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats half of it. The other reason is that the players who actually like challenging stuff spend half their time moaning about how random PuGs are all stupid and dumb people who can't move out of fire. Obviously to make the experience more pleasant for both kinds of people, it has to be easy enough so random PuGs dont constantly cause wipes and slow down the rest of the group, and so they actually can enjoy themselves. Both skilled and unskilled people should have a more pleasant time doing random PuGs.<br />
<br />
And the challenge modes are to compensate for the low difficulty. To give experienced and skilled players something to do. Not to mention the unique mogging gear rewards. You know how people always say &quot;every one looks the same, I remember the days when full tier sets were rare!&quot; Well the few people who manage to do perfect runs through challenge modes will be able to be special snowflakes and rare occurrences that will cause onlookers to gaze upon them and be impressed by their rare gear.<br />

And the gear didn't scale quite as quickly. So it took lots and lots of mindless farming to even get to where you could even attempt a heroic. That coupled with taking forever to find a group if you weren't a tank or a healer made it somewhat suck for the casual player. That's assuming some elitist tank prick didn't kick you for only barely meeting the gearscore prior to the first pull. I used to tow low geared players through heroics all the time. It was actually one of the more fun things I did during little random between raid times. I'm excited to see these difficulty changes for the broad player base overall.</div></div><hr />

Obviously, they want us to kill ourselves. Heroics were actually interesting the first couple of weeks. I guess I don't even have that to look forward to.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, if they are going to make heroics blindingly easy like in Wrath, they will be 3+pack-AoE-able.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know, for &quot;some people&quot; original Cataclysm heroic dungeons were too hard, I'm fine with that. But nowadays, difficulty is already REALLY easy, while being harder than WotLK's difficulty. I can't remember any point in time when dungeons have been as boring as during WotLK, and I'm quite disappointed that Blizzard chose to go back to that kind of design.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'll love the challenge mode, but considering &quot;regular&quot; normal and heroics WILL be part of progression (everyone will HAVE TO go through it), it's a pity many people will have to &quot;suffer&quot; completely dumbed down dungeons :/</div></div><hr />

I see it like the 0-5-10-15% buff in ICC..<br />
It's a really easy way to say &quot;Hey, you have challenging content here ! Just do the same dungeon 5 times in a row an have a cumulative debuff which will make everything harder !&quot;. Funny the first time, eventually, then you get bored :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I wonder why WoW is going down hill... <br />
<br />
How hard is it to grasp really?<br />
<br />
You beat it on gold level, then you get a debuff, that stacks, to make it harder, so that you got something to actually beat as well, sure eventually people will hit a cap, but yeah.<br />
<br />
<br />
The stacking debuff is there to raise the bar even further, above the 3 standard medal levels, its not exactly rocket science to piece it together.<br />
<br />
And tbh, things like this change to dungeons and talents and what not, might be the only thing making me return to WoW, im sick of getting demands just to progress, I mean, sure, you need to be able to complete it, but people dont want to complete content, they want to freaking zergrush through it, something you cant do if you arent geared, so for new players, guess what, they still exist, there is nothing they can do. However, with the lowering of the difficulty bar, people might stop kicking people from heroics and instead just let the poor people get that shiny new piece of gear and points that actually means progression to them.<br />
<br />
The stupidity in the MMO community of late is staggering, reading comprehension is all but tossed out the window, isnt it?<br />
<br />
And no, Im not a native speaker, so I bet there are tons of grammatical errors in my text, before anyone cares to point that bit of obvious info out.</div></div><hr />

They were challenging, required brains/CC and you could take your time with each pull (which was necessary because healers usually lost 50-75% mana on each pull). The only groups that wiped on them were the groups with zero communication, or groups where one idiot jeopardized everything.Now we'll be stuck with faceroll heroics and timed runs with idiots yelling &quot;TANK! PULL! GOGO!&quot; every 5 seconds. What a bummer.It's a damn shame that they gave in to the whiners.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The Lich King Heroic dungeons (and Naxxramas) were too easy to zerg, setting up an expansion-long expectation that purple gear would come easy and often. In retrospect, that was a mistake. We don't at all view the Cataclysm dungeon and raid balance as a mistake.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I was thinking this too, you could skip all the trash and get right to the bosses :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I actually really like some of the ideas here. I don't get how people don't understand them. The stacking debuff could be cool too, just to see how far you can actually push yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing I'm not sure about is the leader board. If it was Guilds rated or Dungeon Teams then maybe, but as they're encouraging people to use the LFG tool to do this, won't your score always only be as good as the lowest common denominator you're randomly grouped with?<br />
<br />
I think they need to start Dungeon Teams, just the same as arena teams, but with a realm wide scoreboard :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously...I'm going to be honest. Is it that hard to grasp such a simple concept? Are you really incapable of reading and translating in game?<br />
<br />
You complete on gold, you get a debuff. That makes it harder to complete it on gold again so it's more rewarding each time. <br />

I'm pretty sure one can still queue for LFG with a team of 5 realm-only people too though? They couldn't possibly expect us to attempt serious timed runs with LFG only groups. <br />
I hope they're considering this ahead of time. They could fix it easily enough by linking the intended pack pulls to the nearest boss, but if the first list of gold medal runs consists only of rogues and druids we know what happened. :P</div></div><hr />

Are you kidding? The challenge mode is an extra thing to make heroics as hard as, and even harder, than cata heroics.<br />
You will still need gear for raids.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also forgot to say that with the item normalization they will actually require SKILL!</div></div><hr />

They should be harder than they were in Cata. Original BC heroic difficulty was perfect.<br />
<br />
Now that they obviously can scale gear based on iLvl, why not just apply the raid gear scaling system to 5-mans? The name &quot;heroic&quot; wouldn't quite mean the same, but you'd have:<br />
<br />
LFD: Just like LFR, this provides a cross-realm queue for finding other players to do 5-mans. Loot quality is a full tier below the current normal-mode raid loot. VP available as it is currently.<br />
<br />
Normal: Just like normal raids, there is no automated cross-realm queuing system for these. They are of superior difficulty to LFD versions, and loot quality is a half-tier below the current normal-mode raid loot. Same VP as LFD.<br />
<br />
Heroic: Same deal, but even harder and loot quality would be equal to the current normal-mode raid loot. Same VP as LFD and Normal mode.<br />
<br />
The scaling can be built around - just like LFR/normal/heroic raiding - the addition or subtraction of things like: individual boss mechanics, mob health, damage output, etc. Can even cheese it with group buffs/debuffs if balancing looks too hard.<br />
<br />
This solves the same problem LFR solved, allowing Blizzard to develop truly challenging and rewarding content without totally leaving bad players (or casual players who just want to farm quick VP a few times per week) in the dust.</div></div><hr />

Good idea but they should just skip the normal version option and make it the heroic option(so LFD is still normal but gear is inferior to raid gear).</div></div><hr />

Are you kidding ? 2 hours long dungeons ? In my world it's already more like 15-20min long dungeons now, and they're still a bit harder than WotLK's ; except they're shorter.<br />

pve battlegrounds: they will never drop somethig usefull because raids have to be better so i won't do them<br />
BG: maybe a new battleground<br />
Arenas: maybe a new arena<br />
Professions: no new professions<br />
A new talent system where the only thing that changed is some pvp utility, a nice modification/addition if i will do PvP<br />
<br />
and now...the Wall of Text:<br />
If all the new &quot;content&quot; they are going to add is for kids that likes pokemon and players that like to pvp, can we have some more new game mechanics after the new talent system?<br />
- Can we have the characters list and then the realms list ? so that we can login with out character on any realm ?<br />
Many Free to Play games support this feature, why wow shouldn't ?<br />
Or at least let us invite people from other servers even for normal and heroic raid modes instead of only old raids that no one cares about ?<br />
- The ability to recolor and not transmogrify aka copy paste the 3d model of another item ?<br />
- Something that put a Guild vs another Guild and not vs a boss/RBG ?<br />
When i first heard of guild challenges i thought Guild vs Guild and not &quot;here take 1k gold for something you usually do.&quot;<br />
- What about a new bg with a tower defense style of gameplay where you build turrets and vehicles that can be used to assault the enemy fortress? (the difference betweek a tower defense and Wintergrasp/Isle of conquest/Strand of the Ancients is that in a Tower Defense you choose where to build the defenses)<br />
- Destructible cities so that we can assault an enemy capital with vehicles, open a hole in a wall and start a massive attack?<br />
- Instead of guild housing what about something more star-wars-ish and give guilds the possibily to create their own little skybreaker ?<br />
It would be something that put a guild vs another guild, it could be something that involves the whole guild in the creation process, we may use some premade parts like tabards that are created with premade borders/icons/colors, the ships could be used as bases during capital cities assaults, there aren't that many guilds on a realm that the sky will end to be obscured<br />
- 15man raids ?<br />
- Healer target dummies ? (they exists in RIFT)<br />
- Do not lower the difficulty of heroics because you are going to introduce the &quot;challenge mode&quot;<br />
A dungeon should be heroic because of the mechanics, not because you deal less damage or you have less hp....<br />
- Make epics feel epics instead of coloring with purple every item above ilvl 320 ?<br />
An item should be called &quot;epic&quot; because it is hard to obtain. Buying an item from a vendor as nothing epic in it..<br />
- Bring back epic scenarios in the raids like you did with Ulduar ' Dragoun Souls is: straight path -&gt; stomach of a mob on the left -&gt; stomach of a mob on the right -&gt; above a tower -&gt; into a recyled blue circle -&gt; above a recycled airship -&gt; above deathwing (cool) -&gt; on four rocks in front a WC where the boss is going down like a s....

<br />
1: wrath heroics were pretty hard at first, we just caught up to them really really fast<br />
2: when people talk about &quot;o, they're 15-20 min now in cata&quot;, well that's because of nerfs and overgearing. in the beginning it was not unusual for heroics to last 2 hrs+<br />
3: a lot of the issue in the beginning of cata was pugs where players came in with the wrath mindset, ie stand in fire, ignore mechanics, and then rage at the healer (when healers were a LOT less powerful) for not healing stupid<br />
<br />
as far as pugs go, early cata difficulty was fail. might be acceptable for a coordinated group, but with all the mouthbreathers in LFG? no way</div></div><hr />

Dude every fight from Vanilla to Wrath was tank and spank, in dungeons mostly but raids for the most part too. That's not a good way to judge them. I CLEARLY remember people shaking in fear at doing some of the Wrath heroics. Some were easier than others like the Nexus, but I clearly remember several that caused groups to instantly quit (like Halls of Reflection.)<br />

<br />
Heroics are the first real step in the progression chain so they're supposed to be fairly easy and even the fabled BC super-heroics were only ever tough when you ran them with random shitters. When they made heroics medium-hard in the past then organised guild groups still breezed through them but anyone who couldn't guarantee to get in a guild run was at the mercy of terrible LFD groups.<br />
<br />
Under the proposed system heroics will not be a crapshoot for the 'ok to good' players who rely on LFD and challenge modes might be an interesting way to make them relevant and interesting beyond the first fortnight of release. They might well fuck up the implementation but I actually like the approach.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Killaim</div><div class="date">2012-01-15, 11:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I wonder why WoW is going down hill... <br />
<br />
How hard is it to grasp really?<br />
<br />
You beat it on gold level, then you get a debuff, that stacks, to make it harder, so that you got something to actually beat as well, sure eventually people will hit a cap, but yeah.<br />
<br />
<br />
The stacking debuff is there to raise the bar even further, above the 3 standard medal levels, its not exactly rocket science to piece it together.<br />
<br />
And tbh, things like this change to dungeons and talents and what not, might be the only thing making me return to WoW, im sick of getting demands just to progress, I mean, sure, you need to be able to complete it, but people dont want to complete content, they want to freaking zergrush through it, something you cant do if you arent geared, so for new players, guess what, they still exist, there is nothing they can do. However, with the lowering of the difficulty bar, people might stop kicking people from heroics and instead just let the poor people get that shiny new piece of gear and points that actually means progression to them.<br />
<br />
The stupidity in the MMO community of late is staggering, reading comprehension is all but tossed out the window, isnt it?<br />
<br />
And no, Im not a native speaker, so I bet there are tons of grammatical errors in my text, before anyone cares to point that bit of obvious info out.<br />
<br />
<br />
The stacking debuff makes no sense because of a very simple reason. Leaderboards.<br />
<br />
Since gear in challenge modes will be normalized, the only determining factor will be how fast can you complete the dungeon. And adding a stacking debuff will obviously make the dungeon run take longer. So, in order to get the shortest time, you'd have to go all out on the first run when you don't have the debuff, or have a leaderboard for each debuff stage and an option to choose any of the difficulty modes, which is completely unnecessary.<br />
<br />
So yeah. Stacking debuff. Sense. Makes none.<br />
<br />
Edit: I actually never noticed before about the stacking debuff, so this is news to me, I apologise for my rudeness. But my point still stands, the stacking debuff would mess up leaderboards too much, unless it never dissipates and Leaderboards activate after you've reached the maximum debuff stack.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree with this. First 2-3 months of Cataclysm were pure gold, nothing during Wotlk came even close to this (Well, maybe Ulduar...). It's really sad if they've really given up with that type of content and just slap a &quot;challenge&quot; mode to replace it.<br />

<br />
Six months in, the development team will hold a round table where they look at the metrics of player usage, they will freak out and their subsequent content patch will be tailored around emotionally blackmailing the playerbase into running Challenge Mode dungeons daily for incentives that are too good to ignore.<br />

How about just making the actual dungeons challenge? Genius blizzard arent I?<br />
This guy gets it. Now that we have three difficulties for raiding, why not do the same thing for dungeons?<br />
<br />
Normal: the levelling dungeons. The stuff you go through before level cap. <br />
<br />
Dungeon Finder: similar to &quot;Raid Finder&quot; difficulty. Easy mechanics for PUGs and content that can be quickly farmed for weekly VP. <br />
<br />
Heroic: like it used to be in TBC. Mechanar, Steamvaults, Magister's Terrace... stuff you can't just faceroll. CC, interrupts, coordination are all needed! :) Think similar to the difficulty between normal/raid finder/ heroic raids.</div></div><hr />

It'll probably involve some sort of point system where you get a certain score for your time and extra for however many stacks of the debuff you have. Or separate leader boards for each stack, or something like that.</div></div><hr />

When Ghostcrawler wrote that post around this time last year, it warmed my heart that Blizzard didn't give in to all the mindless QQ of people who wanted to faceroll themselves to epics. They actually had a spine and stood in for what they had made and what their intentions were with it.<br />

No, it doesn't make sense. It shouldn't make sense either.<br /> 
<br />
Why on Pantheons torn Azeroth would they call it a heroic when it's not even near close to heroic?<br />
<br />
A real heroic was in the Burning Crusade when stuff actually took skill and thought to beat. Not this crap that you zip through while alt tabbing a browsing the web because it's piss easy.</div></div><hr />

Players who play Heroic 5 mans as their only endgame content are an extreeemmeeellyy small amount, especially now with advent of the LFR. Heroics are a stepping stone to raiding. Most raiders despise the long heroics since they dont' want to be wasting their time doing a 2 hour run even after 8 months into an expansion just to snag some gear on the alt or to plow through for quick last minute points. The only players who actually want heroics to be extremely difficult are the extremely vocal minority in the elitist crowd. Not the casual players. Not the actual raiders. The same players calling for the extremely long and painful heroics are the same players who claimed raiding was too easy in wrath and were then bitching when Blizz upped the difficulty.<br />
<br />
If the two large segments of your playerbase want them to be relatively fast, that's the route they'll go. They learned their lesson about caving to a vocal super minority.</div></div><hr />

You are the proof to what is starting to become the norm.<br />
<br />
And it's not what it needs to be.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure you didn't play in BC as it's being hinted in your post. In BC, heroics were difficult. They required CC, which isn't even relevant anymore, they needed tanks to be on their toes, to which now they do an AOE spell and then alt tab, and just overall requiring you to play for what their name stands for: Heroic.<br />
<br />
If you don't want things that take a long time because of your little &quot;tight&quot; raiding schedule, then that is what normal dungeons were for. That is what it was for in BC. That's how things went down. When you wanted something difficult you chose the heroic option instead.<br />
<br />
This is primarily why a lot of people in the comments are distraught. Challenge mode heroics WOULD be fun, if infact the heroics weren't MIND NUMBINGLY boring. And with the talk of them going back to WotLK it'll only get worse. Now it'll be who can AOE hallways the fastest.</div></div><hr />

I didn't have a problem with heroic dungeons being hard, so long as the reward was proportional to he challenge. If the 3 deathwing dungeons were harder, I would not have minded as they rewarded 378 level loot which is on par with regular raid loot from the previous tier. The troll randoms in contrast had very poor loot for the challenge they put forth. It was a meager half tier higher then the blues available from the beginning but were poorly optimized. I didn't feel much incentive to get rid of my 346 level 3.80 speed sword of the bottomless pit for some lame ass 353 weapon with 3.60 speed. That shit barely averages out to a side grade, never mind having to eat the fun costs of regemming and enchanting all that gear that was only a smidge higher in item level then what you had already. The biggest problem though likely stemmed from how Blizzard dolled out that lawl 353 loot right on the eve of Firelands that sported 378's. Troll randoms would have been better received if they had 359 ilevel or at the very least were as optimal as the blues we wore already, to eat both just made it not worth it. Heck, even if troll randoms were available from release that would have at least have served as a gap filler inbetween the starter heroics and raids. Dropping them on us when Firelands are getting patched in in a few weeks however is a little too little too late to care.</div></div><hr />

It means that there will be less validity (if there ever was) to claims coming from those who want a heroic-raid difficulty applied to the heroic dungeons.<br />
<br />
I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Some people have a long-term memory problem. I recall players shuddering at Halls of Stone, swearing off Oculus, wanting a fort buff for Loken from Halls of Lightning, needing a hunter for Slad'ran of Gun'drak, or the rage-quitting when you got one of the ICC 5-mans. Or hey, that one pack of mobs in Drak'theron Keep that feared you into more mobs. Remember that?<br />
<br />
I did all the dungeons when they were fresh content. By the time we were 6 months into Icecrown Citadel, I was enjoying zooming through the instances because I felt I had earned it. Then Cataclysm came along with its nerfs to healers and AoE, and while it can be said that dungeons have become easier as we overgear them, we've never been able to ignore a mechanic since. Now, I'm not for rendering the concept of mechanics entirely obsolete but I also feel cheated somewhat.<br />

a bad decision, so blizzard trying to cater for all who play the game and try and give players something to do, you all get on your high horse and take turns at telling them how bad this is going to be....<br />
<br />
i see it like this, a raider isn't going to do much other then challenge him self in raids/pvp or farm stuff to make gear/repairs...<br />
<br />
someone that pvp's pretty much only pvp's, unless they are in a raiding guild and on his down time he will do the same as the raider <br />
<br />
someone that doesn't raid or pvp are the social people and they have nothing that's really challenging for them other then 5 man's cause people don't want to take them to raids and they don't require enough skill to be any good at pvp...<br />
<br />
to all the people that don't like this, its not meant to be for everyone, its meant to keep people in the game by adding a new challenged...</div></div><hr />

You have to also think about the time. More people heard of the game by the time Wrath came out. Look at wrath to Cata... decline every quarter.

The BC days were over a few years ago my friend. WotLK brought an increase to the player database due to accessibility, its what the majority wants and in the end the game is run on those players money.

Its exceptionally narcissistic, vain and conceded. Everyone is paying for the same game, sure if there weren't sub fees then maybe I would agree. However maybe you missed this but WotLK introduced these things called heroic modes which allowed 'hardcore' titles etc which people could then oogle at. Personally seeing the top guilds on my realm with LoD title was always impressive (standard guild stuck at 11/12hc). Currently a guild has just achieved SoA title from hc DW, if you don't think that's impressive then i'm guessing the majority of people here don't value your opinion very highly.</div></div><hr />

They're getting rid of max level normal dungeon runs so they need to lower the difficulty a bit so players can run heroics sooner. Looks like the &quot;true&quot; heroic runs will be in Challenge Mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not saying its not impressive but in all reality compared to other final bosses of expansions or raids.. its not.. Heroic Rag was impressive. Light of Dawn was impressive considering I was in the only 1 of 2 guilds on Shadowmoon to get it. Compared to the amount of time it took to kill Muru compared to heroic DeathWing... come on now.. Muru wasnt even the final boss of the raid. Yes everyone is paying for the same game.. doesnt mean everyone is as good at it or willing to put as much time into it. Im not trying to come at you as a person at all but I feel people with your mentality are the majority of the people who swayed blizzards minds in making the game what it is today.. Easy.<br />
<br />
Took this from another thread<br />
<br />
Cata, but I think Wrath, DS, and what MoP will be is the best model. Lots to do for casuals and sufficient challenge for people who want to raid more hard core. Win/win for everyone. Except people who complain all the time -.-<br />

Probably because a large portion of the player base complains about dungeons being too hard, while another complains about them being too easy.<br />
<br />
Perhaps with challenge mode dungeons and heroics back to easy, they can appease both sets.<br />
<br />
How you can challenge mode when you just picking up half of the dungeon mobs AOE them and then doing the same with second half...???...dungeon done.</div></div><hr />

Back before the housing boom, most people had to have good credit, save up money for a down payment and do all the necessary things in order to afford a home. Then, some people said &quot;Hey, I work 40 hours a week too, why can't I have a home too?&quot; so then mortgage companies came up with these new and innovative ways so that just about anyone could own a home, even without down payments or even good credit ratings. So then what happened was these people got into homes they wouldn't have been able to afford before and ended up either upside down or broke because they couldn't really afford it to begin with. They then decide the best course of action is to trash the home, move out and file for bankruptcy. By doing this, they screwed the people that really could afford their own homes and now those people are upside down or the value of their home has gone down by as much as 50%. <br />
<br />
The same kind of thing has happened in WoW as well. People, early on decided that they wanted to raid so they put forth the effort to gear up, form guilds and study strategies in order to raid and enjoy a good challenge. They know that if they work hard they'll be rewarded for their efforts with fantastic looking gear. Then what happened is the casuals came in and said &quot;Hey, we pay 15 dollars a month too, we want to be able to see all the content and get all the gear w/o the effort&quot; so Blizzard listened and decided to come up with new and innovative ways so that casuals could see the content too and that's where LFR comes in. Now, those same casuals, who after running LFR for weeks on end, decide that LFR is boring now and they're going to unsub because they got everything needed and they face rolled through the content. <br />
<br />
Now, the original people that loved that game and loved a good challenge, are now stuck with this flaming piece of pig shit called MoP.</div></div><hr />

Please, TBC was the pinnacle and unfortunately for people that enjoy a good challenge, those days are long gone. Now, here comes MoP and since only casuals can devote 3 minutes a week to the game, people will be mailed 1 epic a week so they don't miss out.</div></div><hr />

Well, if they are stuck killing Prince there's also the possibility that they can't get the numbers to go up to 25 mans and not just being bads as you claim.<br />
<br />
But to those guilds that were wiping on Karazhan trash, I don't know what that is.</div></div><hr />

Because the same thing doesn't happen in the real world either huh? Bigger companies recruiting people from smaller companies to come work for them happens every day in every corner of the world. Also, the last time I checked, you can't enslave people to come raid in your guild, that player makes the conscious decision to leave his guild.</div></div><hr />

Time to run challenge mode dungeons to have some fun while the rest of the guild levels &amp; gears up for raids. Queue for BRC with guild mates for your first challenge mode. Complete it in a certain time, get a bronze medal. You queue for a few more and can't move any faster (due to mechanics &amp; gear limitations). Day 1 accomplishments: 3 bronze medals. day 4: You've maxed out some reps, have some epic gear, and your guild group is a bit more competent. You queue for three more heroics and earn some silver medals and manage to squeeze out one gold medal. day 10: You've begun to raid and now have about half 359 gear. You can get a gold medal on about 75% of runs so you haven't quite unlocked the stacking debuff. You start appearing on the bottom of the leader bored. day 15: You've acquired mostly 359 gear and can get a gold medal every time with your group. You can now start working your way up in % buffs. Now with each % buff, what attributes are lowered? I'm thinking 5%: Health Damage Healing Movement Speed Haste</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you truly buy into that... you've got blinders on, my friend.<br />
<br />
Activision has a lot to do with long-term goals in World of Warcraft, and Blizzard games in general. There is give and take here between what they can monetize and what would be shameless monetization... so they strike a middle-ground, and we see things like the purchasable items and paid services in WoW, and the RMAH in Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard today were 100% the same Blizzard from the 90s, you would not see nearly as many cash-grabs in their games.</div></div><hr />

Because no one should be proud or happy about a reward they've received after accomplishing something right? They game you're looking for is called Communism. You should look it up, it's where everyone is just like everyone else and you can actually play it in real life, you just need to be able to move to one of those countries.<br />
<br />
Also, it's called &quot;Challenge Mode&quot;, not &quot; It's Ok guys, I'll stay even though we're 45 minutes behind my usual time Mode&quot;. Get real bro, of course people aren't going to stay if they know they're not going to finish on time, why would they?</div></div><hr />

Back before the housing boom, most people had to have good credit, save up money for a down payment and do all the necessary things in order to afford a home. Then, some people said &quot;Hey, I work 40 hours a week too, why can't I have a home too?&quot; so then mortgage companies came up with these new and innovative ways so that just about anyone could own a home, even without down payments or even good credit ratings. So then what happened was these people got into homes they wouldn't have been able to afford before and ended up either upside down or broke because they couldn't really afford it to begin with. They then decide the best course of action is to trash the home, move out and file for bankruptcy. By doing this, they screwed the people that really could afford their own homes and now those people are upside down or the value of their home has gone down by as much as 50%. <br />
<br />
The same kind of thing has happened in WoW as well. People, early on decided that they wanted to raid so they put forth the effort to gear up, form guilds and study strategies in order to raid and enjoy a good challenge. They know that if they work hard they'll be rewarded for their efforts with fantastic looking gear. Then what happened is the casuals came in and said &quot;Hey, we pay 15 dollars a month too, we want to be able to see all the content and get all the gear w/o the effort&quot; so Blizzard listened and decided to come up with new and innovative ways so that casuals could see the content too and that's where LFR comes in. Now, those same casuals, who after running LFR for weeks on end, decide that LFR is boring now and they're going to unsub because they got everything needed and they face rolled through the content. <br />
<br />
Now, the original people that loved that game and loved a good challenge, are now stuck with this flaming piece of pig shit called MoP.<br />

Just like timed run ZA? I queued for a random dungeon alone and got grouped up with some guys and we finished the timed run and I even got the mount. Very hard indeed.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can do now is farm gear by doing heroics or battlegrounds. I am already bored by heroics that I can't stand doing them after only three weeks of playing. I farmed all my pvp gear in just 4 days on my main. I did nerfed FL hardmodes yesterday with my old guild. I admit that I got boosted but what a joke was that. Now I understand why people said they were more like normals after nerfs. The mechanics on 10 man are a f-ing joke, seriously. All I did was stand still and spam heals.<br />
<br />
This game is so boring now. The only reason I will keep playing is to pvp with an old gaming friend of mine and that's it. If he decides to stop pvping then I will stop my subscription right away.<br />
&quot;Challenge modes&quot;, yeah right. Why would I do challenge mode anyway? Not for some valor points and also not for pets and titles that everyone is going to have. It's just like achievements they only gave it a different name to make it look exciting. I bet a lot of people will fall for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How hard is it to grasp really?<br />
<br />
You beat it on gold level, then you get a debuff, that stacks, to make it harder, so that you got something to actually beat as well, sure eventually people will hit a cap, but yeah.<br />
<br />
<br />
The stacking debuff is there to raise the bar even further, above the 3 standard medal levels, its not exactly rocket science to piece it together.<br />
<br />
And tbh, things like this change to dungeons and talents and what not, might be the only thing making me return to WoW, im sick of getting demands just to progress, I mean, sure, you need to be able to complete it, but people dont want to complete content, they want to freaking zergrush through it, something you cant do if you arent geared, so for new players, guess what, they still exist, there is nothing they can do. However, with the lowering of the difficulty bar, people might stop kicking people from heroics and instead just let the poor people get that shiny new piece of gear and points that actually means progression to them.<br />
<br />
The stupidity in the MMO community of late is staggering, reading comprehension is all but tossed out the window, isnt it?<br />
<br />
And no, Im not a native speaker, so I bet there are tons of grammatical errors in my text, before anyone cares to point that bit of obvious info out.<br />
<br />
So how is that fun? Please tell me. You do the same freaking dungeon 30 times only with a debuff and then you get a title and a pet and valor points which you already capped. Yes, I really want to do the same dungeon for the 30st time for that.<br />
<br />
Instead of giving people tier 13 from heroics, which they are not going to use for anything other than 'looking cool', give them a noob mode where they can do all content on super easy and reward only titles and pets and make heroics how they should be.<br />

See, this is exactly why wannabe hardcores never turned off the ICC buff. They do NOT care about difficulty but how others play this game.<br />
<br />
You will always do the same freaking dungeon 30 times, this was always the case in WOW especially during TBC where people ran Kara all the time until they got so sick of it, it is the same dumb argument that you have to beat normal first to get to a heroic raid..........which you will farm until your eyes bleed out anyway but you had to do it in normal ONCE OH MY GAWD THE SKY IS FALLING!!!!!11</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't mean I want to do it on super easy mode first 30 times and then 30 times on hardmode. By then it's already boring. And btw for your information I never ran dungeons that many times in TBC. You know why? Because they were hard and took longer. And there was a progression path unlike now where you skip everything so you can show off your ugly epics, 'see the content' and then farm it for 4 months after only progressing for a week.<br />
<br />
You get something like this:<br />
Lord Marrowgar kills (Icecrown 10 player) 15<br />
Lord Marrowgar kills (Heroic Icecrown 10 player) 4<br />
Lord Marrowgar kills (Icecrown 25 player) 16<br />
Lord Marrowgar kills (Heroic Icecrown 25 player) 12<br />
<br />
No wonder my guild got burned out. And before you start whining that I shouldn't have done 10 man raids: there was nothing else to do. <br />
<br />
Times completed the Trial of the Crusader (10 player) 8<br />
Times completed the Trial of the Grand Crusader (10 player) 11<br />
Times completed the Trial of the Crusader (25 player) 11<br />
Times completed the Trial of the Grand Crusader (25 player) 5<br />
<br />
Thankfully we weren't good enough to finish that one earlier or otherwise it would have been 50 or 60 clears.<br />
<br />
In TBC if you started a new guild at least you could progress from tier to tier and you had a lot more to do than just do the same instance over and over again.<br />
<br />
And please tell me which hardcores turned of the ICC buff. The only onces were Paragon on LK only and after farming all the gear. Different difficulties are a joke. It's not progression.</div></div><hr />

I took a bit of a break before Cata and came back because of the hype that it would be the best ever expansion etc etc. Having played through it I am very disappointed by the content. There seems to be an abundance of &quot;old&quot; dungeons and re-used models and maps, and a distinct lack of the feeling that we are taking part in an epic adventure. As some people already said in many other threads, WoW has become a lobby game.If that is extrapolated into challenge modes it will make the game feel more like a series of reward runs and mini-games than ever before, and in fact Wow already feels much more like LoL or HoN to me than any other MMO.</div></div><hr />

Epics to the people lol! :cool:<br />
<br />
Oh god does this bug me like hell. Is this not, thinking like you do, &quot;pampering to&quot; the casuals and bads then? I really really really don't get why they should make heroics faceroll easy for everyone to run through, just for gear. There are normal modes right?<br />
<br />
Going with Blizzards philosophy on LFR, this shit makes no sense at all. LFR is easy and according to blizzard to let people &lt;see the content&gt;. Not get gear/epics. Is it so hard to apply that philosophy on 5man normal and 5man heroic? You run it on normal, you have seen the content. Or do you really need to see the same item in purple text to have seen the content? (Thinking about it, launch heroics probably still won't drop epics hah.)<br />
<br />
Feels like the normal mode 5man philosophy is comparable to if Blizzard would add LFR, and make it so easy you can do it asleep, and then make Normal the same difficulty as LFR should be.<br />
<br />
Also, agreeing with someone else here; I wanted a challenging dungeon, not one I have to rush and stress through. Will still do challenge modes though, better than nothing I guess.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarlathe</div><div class="date">2012-01-16, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats half of it. The other reason is that the players who actually like challenging stuff spend half their time moaning about how random PuGs are all stupid and dumb people who can't move out of fire. Obviously to make the experience more pleasant for both kinds of people, it has to be easy enough so random PuGs dont constantly cause wipes and slow down the rest of the group, and so they actually can enjoy themselves. Both skilled and unskilled people should have a more pleasant time doing random PuGs.<br />
<br />
And the challenge modes are to compensate for the low difficulty. To give experienced and skilled players something to do. Not to mention the unique mogging gear rewards. You know how people always say &quot;every one looks the same, I remember the days when full tier sets were rare!&quot; Well the few people who manage to do perfect runs through challenge modes will be able to be special snowflakes and rare occurrences that will cause onlookers to gaze upon them and be impressed by their rare gear.<br />
<br />
But then you read;<br />
<br />
<br />
Challenge Mode dungeons will use the Dungeon Finder tool.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't really care one way or another, but I think we will still have the same amount of qq in the forums about this.<br />
<br />
I just came back to WoW after a short break, and have been running the new 5 mans. If that is the level of difficulty in Mists, then it might be a good compromise. I can still heal stupid, finish my run and get my satchel of useless goods without having my blood pressure go nuts. Now, LFR on the other hand I find stupidly to easy. Even if I can't heal stupid, we generally succeed with no real problem. I've seen both tanks go down and still succeeded. Now that's a head scratcher.</div></div><hr />

You clearly never watched a skilled hunter chain-trapping AND kiting mobs (during the same pull), while helping a Protection warrior tank the Shattered Halls on heroic. Even in Cataclysm, I watched a warlock keep up a cycle of Banish, Curse of Exhaustion and Fear in a Stonecore pull thanks to a crappy healer.<br />

How typically clueless of you, det; ignorant of both the cause, and the effect. Blinded by Blizzard love.<br />
<br />
Shattered Halls and Stratholme were challenging instances in their time, a time where your tank couldn't pick everything up and let ingrates zerg everything down. Thunderclap was warrior AoE, and it wasn't even available in Defensive Stance.</div></div><hr />

Not anymore. When they pulled the whole pack and you needed to CC five out of seven mobs and AoE would break them and each one of those mobs would one shot a cloth user and two shot a tank it was different. At least harder than spamming your AoE.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why you keep replying. All you say at every thread, that you don't like, that everyone is complaining. Go play the game if you like it so much instead of trolling the forums. I think 2000 posts is already too much but your 8700 posts is really over the top.</div></div><hr />

Why on Pantheons torn Azeroth would they call it a heroic when it's not even near close to heroic?<br />
<br />
A real heroic was in the Burning Crusade when stuff actually took skill and thought to beat. Not this crap that you zip through while alt tabbing a browsing the web because it's piss easy.<br />
<br />
why on azeroth would a raiider want to spend atleast 2 hours in ONE trying to gear for raids thats what dosent mak sence<br />

And then complaining the rest of the week that there's nothing to do? As a raider, you should probably be asking for harder 5 mans, with loot that ties in with raids a bit better.<br />
<br />
ive never once complained that theres nothing to do i got 4 chars that i spread out to lvl and gear i got pvp and if it impelmented the pet battles also and if im done all of that by tuesday i have tv my 3ds and my wii</div></div><hr />

I'm not totally convinced about this feature, but it seems a good compromise between giving something challenging to hardcores and making the gearing process available to everyone. Just hope that gold medals rewards are very cool pets and nice transmogrify armor :) P.S: for everyone saying &quot;but i won't do the same istance over and over&quot;, i respond &quot;but you are doing LFR over and over to get gear for you char&quot;; also, you don't need at all Challenge modes gear, since it's all vanity gear :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've said it before, and I'll say it again: Some people have a long-term memory problem. I recall players shuddering at Halls of Stone, swearing off Oculus, wanting a fort buff for Loken from Halls of Lightning, needing a hunter for Slad'ran of Gun'drak, or the rage-quitting when you got one of the ICC 5-mans. Or hey, that one pack of mobs in Drak'theron Keep that feared you into more mobs. Remember that?<br />
<br />
I did all the dungeons when they were fresh content. By the time we were 6 months into Icecrown Citadel, I was enjoying zooming through the instances because I felt I had earned it. Then Cataclysm came along with its nerfs to healers and AoE, and while it can be said that dungeons have become easier as we overgear them, we've never been able to ignore a mechanic since. Now, I'm not for rendering the concept of mechanics entirely obsolete but I also feel cheated somewhat.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Moving more on topic... I'm surprised that so few shaman went for the T2 set. Guess that make me one of the more unique. ;)<br />
<br />
This, for the love of all that is holy, THIS. I am so sick of hearing people say &quot;Oh lol Wrath heroics were easy mode from day one, lololol&quot;<br />
<br />
No, they weren't. You people only remember them as easy as we were stuck in a year-long end-game run where we out geared all the old heroics by 51-64 points. ANYTHING in this game will become faceroll at that level of gear jump. What you people don't remember is what the heroics were like at launch, or choose not to remember so you can jump on the disgusting bandwagon of Wrathbabies that Total Buiscuit set (and everyone seems to adamantly follow).<br />
<br />
Here's a few examples of what I'm sure you failed to remember from Wrath's early days:<br />
<br />
Nexus: Anomolus and Keristrasza were pug-killers when people were going in at the launch in heroic mode.<br />
<br />
Azjol-Nerub: The opening gauntlet that wiped pug after pug due to not having the DPS or CC required to bring the mini-bosses down before the next wave activated.<br />
<br />
Old Kingdom: Oh hai there trash that would one-shot a tank if they weren't interrupted, how you doing? Let's also not forget Jedoga and her tank-obliteration if an add wasn't killed, or how standing in her lightning was in fact a kill move early on.<br />
<br />
Gundrak: Slad'ran, the boss groups were unable to kill early on without kiting him out of the room in order to ignore an entire mechanic. Yup, that sure was an easy boss.<br />
<br />
Halls of Stone: Tribunal of Ages. Enough said. I had groups that wouldn't even bother with anything else in the dungeon until they were sure the group could down this boss, and early on it was very much indeed a struggle to finish.<br />
<br />
Halls of Lightning: Loken. He needs no introductions, but according to most people, he was just a silly spank 'n tank that we downed on our first go with zero problems, yup, easy mode right?<br />
<br />
Oculus: Eragos before they added gear scaling to the tanks. This is the epitome of what you people consider an epic fight in Cataclysm. Everyone has to stay on their toes, no one can make any mistakes, and each person must have a mastery of their drake's rotations and when to pop certain abilities to down him. But oh, wait, he's a vehicle fight, that just means he's broken and difficult for the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
Yes, there were easy-mode heroics in Wrath like UK, UP, and Drak'theron keep, but there were also very easy heroics at the start of Cataclysm too, such as Vortex Pinnacle, Tol'vir, and Throne of the Tides. However, like Alayea said, so many of you have apparently forgotten what Wrath was like at launch. Unless you were in full Sunwell Plateau gear and running these heroics with your guild in equally powerful gear, you were not face rolling these dungeons at launch. And mind you, this is only the launch heroics of Wrath. I'm not even going to get into how difficult Firefighterand Yogg Zero keepers was, how the Lich King was boss that took the longest for any guild to down in the history of the damned game (that's going from his release on the second of Feb to his defeat on Heroic 25 on the 26th of March), or how Sartharion, an entry-level boss, was incredibly difficult to defeat early on with three drakes up.<br />
<br />
No no, Wrath was nothing but easy mode sillyness where everyone was simply able to faceroll everything right out of the gate. Though I suppose I can't really be too upset at people. Being stuck in the end-game of an expansion for an entire year will cause most people to forget what the game was like before they had easy-access to 251 and better gear right at level 80.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, are you for real ? *-*<br />
None of the bosses you listed were hard at any point of the expansion. Maybe Loken, if the people were retarded enough..<br />
WotLK's heroics were stupidly easy from start. The only way to fail was to be a COMPLETE newbie who never, ever, ever, ever looked at the game's tooltips from lvl 1. And for me that is quite an achievement.<br />
<br />
I really don't like what they're aiming at, I'm honestly convinced that if they decided to use a design where they gave newbies some tools, at some points during progression, to understand the game better, cheer them up and allow them to step up, it would be better for everyone. Them, the community, everyone. &quot;Challenge&quot; doesn't equal &quot;Time spent in game&quot;, I'm actually a total casual, and I enjoy 30min heroic dungeon runs, but I want those 30min to be at least A BIT thrilling.<br />
Challenge mode's goal isn't for progress, so we'll still have to go through Heroics, but WotLK-ish heroics won't do it for me.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarlathe</div><div class="date">2012-01-16, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">World of Warcraft has become a microcosm of what's wrong with America today. Back before the housing boom, most people had to have good credit, save up money for a down payment and do all the necessary things in order to afford a home. Then, some people said &quot;Hey, I work 40 hours a week too, why can't I have a home too?&quot; so then mortgage companies came up with these new and innovative ways so that just about anyone could own a home, even without down payments or even good credit ratings. So then what happened was these people got into homes they wouldn't have been able to afford before and ended up either upside down or broke because they couldn't really afford it to begin with. They then decide the best course of action is to trash the home, move out and file for bankruptcy. By doing this, they screwed the people that really could afford their own homes and now those people are upside down or the value of their home has gone down by as much as 50%. <br />
<br />
You do realize that the people &quot;that truly deserved their home&quot; weren't effect in the least by this housing bubble/sub-prime/poisoned mortgage game right? They stayed in their nice, sub-2000 square foot home. Lived within their means (ie: Didn't use their &quot;home equity&quot; to buy the big SUV and other useless crap). They weren't effected by the credit crunch. <br />
<br />
Please, go read up on what really happened and how it does effect 80% of the population that are living off of their credit. The 20% that don't play the &quot;keeping up with the Jones&quot; game are doing fine and laughing at all the gullible fools. <br />
<br />
<br />
The same kind of thing has happened in WoW as well. People, early on decided that they wanted to raid so they put forth the effort to gear up, form guilds and study strategies in order to raid and enjoy a good challenge. They know that if they work hard they'll be rewarded for their efforts with fantastic looking gear. Then what happened is the casuals came in and said &quot;Hey, we pay 15 dollars a month too, we want to be able to see all the content and get all the gear w/o the effort&quot; so Blizzard listened and decided to come up with new and innovative ways so that casuals could see the content too and that's where LFR comes in. Now, those same casuals, who after running LFR for weeks on end, decide that LFR is boring now and they're going to unsub because they got everything needed and they face rolled through the content. <br />
<br />
Now, the original people that loved that game and loved a good challenge, are now stuck with this flaming piece of pig shit called MoP.<br />
<br />
This is a game. It has evolved past that point. People don't want to commit to 3+ nights of raiding anymore. They don't want 2+ hour heroics. They do want to log in, do a few things, then log out and go do other stuff. <br />
<br />
My personal thoughts on this are: <br />
<br />
Fine, it makes sense. If I want challenging modes or content, I'll go with my guildies. People that I know what their skill level is. I will have fun that way. This is what I said earlier in the post, I'm still a little surprised that this will be part of the LFD tool. Unless they have a clear option to select this, I can see fight after fight and rage quits in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't wait to try this out (to be fair I say that about everything in this expansion), should be interesting how this turns out in the end, especially with PuG runs.<br />
<br />
This seems to look accurate to me. I like a good challenge as much as the next guy but placing annoying boss mechanics on certain bosses to me is dumb, perfect examples of this was the 2nd boss in heroic black rock caverns and cookie in heroic deadmines. Both are examples of heroic fights that new players at 85 cant do on their first try, these are the types of mechanics that are unforgiving and don't add to difficulty just annoyance for new players. I have been playing for 7 years and I still think that kind of shit is stupid and unnecessary for fights.</div></div><hr />

Edit: If they mean as WotLK heroics were when first dinging 80, then that's alright I guess. It comes down to how the decide to scale gear. If they, on the other hand, scale gear as if it were Naxx-level or higher, then this is going to be a horrible experience</div></div><hr />

Remember the days when you used to thoroughly read a boss guide on bosskillers.com or equivelant websites before your first time on a boss? Good times! Anyway to the real point of actual dungeons. The main reason Blizzard is doing this is for the casual players, I understand sure but that's not the way to fix the problem. Casual doesn't necesserily mean easy, I wouldn't mind a fast dungeon with a challenge and people with lesser gear/understanding for basic mechanics concept could just stick to normals? Its how any progress works, you work up the ladder, but seems like blizzard wants people to jump a few steps up the ladder. I mean the only way to do this is actually having the normal difficulties(lvl90) reward decent enough rewards, and the heroic difficulties is what's all about not ignoring boss mechanics or its a whipe(Just like LFR and Normal). Because then challenge modes will be one easy thing to do everyday if its done in Wotlk HC level, it will be all about ignoring mechanics and run your ass off through the dungeon. Now to people saying that wotlk hc's wasn't hard at start, as this is partially true only for a few bosses(not whole dungeons) I think Blizzard's mention of the words 'Wotlk HC level' is that they intend to make it easy, just read between the lines.</div></div><hr />

People don't want to commit to 3+ nights of raiding anymore. Yes its called PuG raids which many have been doing for over three years. Players dont have to commit to a raiding guild and a fixed schedule. I did progression raiding with a guild from Kara to BT back in BC and when WotLK hit I moved to PuGs and have been doing such until 4.3 due to the significant drop of players wanting to PuG normal modes when I play and this includes my own efforts of trying to lead my own raid. When it comes down to it many players dont want to make that step up in difficulty for marginally better rewards. The reward system Blizzard is shifting to is to place the bulk of the rewards for players putting in minimum effort only reflects such and the idea of improving oneself and being rewarded for such is becoming a thing of the past.</div></div><hr />

Now most casuals will just shift their complaints to challenge mode being too hard. They need to stop cow towing to the casual player base. It's a sect of players that will ultimately never be happy until this game is reduced to Hello Kitty Island Adventure. They turned gearing from a 4-6 month affair down to about a day or so. They've gone too far in the other direction and it's going to only hurt the game more as time goes on. Every tier gets released and casual players get bored faster slamming heroics and now LFR to get geared in the first week or 2, then returning to their daily grind. The gear doesn't have the epic feel of BC and prior gear because you didn't have to work that hard for it. I understand that they wanted more people to raid, but they went to far in changing gear from a reward based on time and hard work to an overnight affair. Because gear is acquired so easily it becomes trivialized and doesn't mean nearly as much. It's hard to take pride in gear that is practically thrown at you. I guess that's what casuals wanted though, free gear.</div></div><hr />

Its not about the boss difficulty, it is about the trash. TBC trash mods hit so hard that you have to crowd control or it will be a wipe.<br />
I still remember we can aoeing everything in Utgarde Keep then Ingvar one-shot the tank with smash.<br />

Certain fights were hard for certain classes and comps because they lacked the tools necessary to combat the mechanics. That's not the same as Cata's &quot;overall challenging&quot; philosophy. It just meant I cried when I had to heal a fight with a lot of AOE damage on my paladin (like the first boss in heroic Gun'Drak). <br />
<br />
Anyway, I jut want the difficulty to stick. As it I right now, dungeons are only challenging anymore if you're a freshly dinged healer and you get a freshly dinged tank who thinks he's in WOTLK zerg mode.our gear simply scales too quickly for any real lingering challenge, and then on top of that he dungeons are nerfed. If you don't raid (I know, most people do now that it's so accessable) you have no challenging PVE content, ad that's not very fun.</div></div><hr />

Mechanar, Steamvaults, Magister's Terrace... stuff you can't just faceroll. CC, interrupts, coordination are all needed! :) Think similar to the difficulty between normal/raid finder/ heroic raids.<br />
<br />
You had me until you listed the easiest dungeons of all time. Seriously, unless you really sucked those dungeons were beyond easy. The only remotely hard heroic in all of TBC was heroic Shattered Halls and even that was cake if you had a paladin tank. If you were lucky enough to have a paladin tank the entire expansion was AOE pulls. The problem wasn't that trash was hard it was that any tank besides a paladin couldn't hold AOE aggro.<br />

Maybe it's because they realized that most players aren't in solid 10/25 guilds, and yet a disproportionate amount of every patch is content for these people. So blizz decided to devote development time to cover a larger group of their players<br />
<br />
With an aging target population, the people that could once devote time to guilds are now devoting time to their actual lives. The result is that Blizzard had to invent systems that would allow people to play less often and still progress. The start of that was LFR. You can have your character through LFR and done with their weekly Valor cap in around 4 hours now. The rest of the week you don't need to do anything, so you can focus on your actual life.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apollet</div><div class="date">2012-01-18, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Paladin tank through all of BC (except for holy the first 3-4 months), heroics were NOT that hard. I was in a guild full of clueless people that only played together because they were an extended RL group of friends/family. Tbh, the only heroic that I had to CC on was MGT and in that case, a warlock, rogue OR mage was sufficient. By the time my average item level was 131 (just slightly past tier 4), we were selling trial of the naaru runs for 100g a person and finishing them with 25 minutes on the timer. I didn't like SL or AC because they both had copious amounts of trash that wasn't particularly hard, just high health and tedious to pull. A lot of heroics, however, were similar to Cata release at first when I healed them. They weren't 3 hours wipe fests, though. A good tank and 1 or 2 well placed cc's were perfectly fine for running heroics. My tank friend and I could make it through all except SL, SH and AC in less than an hour. I am fine with the model they are going for with two strict conditions: 1) Easier, faster trash is fine as long as bosses can still wipe groups. Cata had decent bosses. Most pugs and groups could down bosses in a few attempts. It was just the painful trash pulls in some heroics that would total people. The most wipes I ever had in a random group was 12 on Karsh Steelbender the 5th day of the xpac. Everything else went down in 5 or less the first time. Imo, the trash pulls should be about 4-8 between bosses (4 if they're tougher 4-5 pulls, 8 if they're small pulls). The pack should have 1 target that's particularly potent and needs to be cc'd or focused. But in general the rest can just be held by the tank and aoe'd or single targeted down. 2) Challenge modes need to be sufficiently challenging. I want to have a release of nerdrage when I beat the gold medal 15-20% (3-4 stack) debuff and move up a rung on the totem pole. There really should be extra incentive for completing them, too. Like valor point rewards for completing it on challenge mode and justice points for regular.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, Mech was so easy. That's why almost everyone always skipped Sepethrea. Heck I can still hear my healer crying at the gauntlet before the last boss, only to be disappointed (both of us) that we had to go back in another day because my sword (http://www.wowhead.com/item=29362)still didn't drop. There were a lot of complex pathing mobs and those STILL get people on NORMAL if you're going through a RDF PUG. Because dungeons aren't made like that anymore, people feel tricked and cheated if they pull one of those groups at the wrong time because it chains 3-4 other groups. Same thing in SV, that first room was absolutely killer unless you know the paths through it (which of course we do; new players don't). <br />
<br />
You think Shattered Halls was the hardest, I agree that it was hard too; but it's tough to take you seriously when you say that Mag Terrace was easy? Really? Well I guess it's true everyone had a different experience in TBC.</div></div><hr />

If you did the timed Shattered Halls run which was chain pulling and what not to save the prisoners it was far from easy..<br />
