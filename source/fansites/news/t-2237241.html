Five years ago, I received a phone call from Blizzard offering me the chance of a lifetime—a position on the World of Warcraft team.<br />
<br />
Simply put, this is my favorite game of all time, and working on it these past five years has been a dream come true. I have learned so much from the women and men who make it and everyone who plays it. I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to work on a game that so many people around the world are so passionate about.<br />
<br />
A few weeks ago, I was offered a new opportunity at Blizzard that I’m really excited about. Tomorrow is my last day working on World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
As a longtime player, I couldn't be more excited about what the future has in store for World of Warcraft. In particular, the PvP team remains hard at work on some incredible plans. I fully expect that the best years of World of Warcraft PvP are ahead of us.<br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone involved with World of Warcraft, from the development team to the players, for letting me be a part of this game's community. I consider it a great privilege.<br />
<br />

Yep. Pretty sad that instead of wishing him well they choose to go on the offensive. Pretty sad people have to insult 1 person when they damn well know the WoW team designs as a collective.</div></div><hr />

Kinda odd how he mentions PvP excessively, when it is the thing he was criticized for the most.<br />

The fact that so much is pointed at him says something about the playerbase. If they believe that holinka was solely responsible for the state of pvp and that him leaving will magically fix everything, boy are those people in for a sour and rough time ahead. I also pity whoever is going to fill his spot really.<br />
<br />
All the best to Holinka on whatever new project he works on. Hope he will be a bit more on the background, so people won't instantly toss shade at him when a minor detail of the game isn't perfect.</div></div><hr />

Ah, yes, the classic &quot;careful what you wish for&quot;, which was something I repeated amongst friends of mine back when GC (or Turdcrawler as he had become known in my inner circle). Now WoW has the likes of Hazzikostas, Celestalon, and until today, Holinka. :p</div></div><hr />

I don't think that Blizzard will allow any games on Battle.net and not have some input on the development ? He may not be involved with the game it's self, but the integration into the B.net system.</div></div><hr />

Why would you put a gameplay system desigern on that job? I mean he could lie and this &quot;opportunity&quot; is just a &quot;disciplinary transfer&quot; but even then that would be kinda weird. I don't think they need input as well. Activision has no storefront as of now. I think the battle net thing will just be the one they'll use in the future and this is just their trial ballon.</div></div><hr />

He's just an asshole to players that takes a very &quot;YOU'RE WRONG I AM RIGHT&quot; stance, and then is shown to be wrong like a week later. An extremely recent example: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/6h6kiz/in_which_celestalon_responds_to_feral_concerns/</div></div><hr />

I tried to find the exact quotes, but he made some pretty hilarious and out of touch comments on Ele and Enh Shamans during WoD, before they were drastically buffed.

Ok so some guy plays WoW differently and that is a reason for them to be fired? Jesus way to grasp at straws. So what if he plays on a tablet? It hasn't affected the game in the slightest. Trust issue is on you.<br />

he is a cry baby, calling people out for telling him that their speccs are really underperforming and he gives them an attitude (legion feral for example), he called out a streamer for hyperbole because said streamer just said pruning hurts the game and removes skillcap. plus that he is really arrogant.

I don't think he's without talent; he had to design a game within a larger (PvE) game, which certainly can't be easy. Ashran was a failure that he never owned up to though , and he's always been fairly condescending which hasn't helped him either.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because firing someone who works for 5 years or longer at your company is bound to dismissal wage. Its more simple to move him into a lower position elsewhere, with payment cuts so that he leaves on his own in the next few years. Same thing happened to the vanilla D3 Game Director.</div></div><hr />

How does that say why it hasn't happened. No kidding they &quot;should be seeking help.&quot; <br />
So should every person who's ever felt the need to murder or assault someone over a petty dispute. You know what still happens all the time? People attacking and murdering others over petty disputes. The fact that someone should be seeking or be given help really says nothing at all about whether or not they are.</div></div><hr />

And no I'm not defending him at all; this can happen for any portion of the game that generally isn't received well.

Ashran wasnt that bad.. also I have to admit the no flying part did wonders for world PvP. However who ever is responsible for Legion BGs should get fired. Professional PvPers never had trouble getting the gear.. same as with professional raiders. I for one will never do arenas as I dont want to (arenas suck).. balance then separately for all I care.. same goes for rated BGs.. but stop ruining normal casual BGs with this &quot;gear doesnt matter&quot; nonsense. <br />
<br />
The only way any MMO can justify grind is by giving out rewards and some players (like yours truly) want actual rewards that increase player power, not that prestige crap.</div></div><hr />

It's just funny, tragic, and sad that this is an xpac designed for all the players that wanted things like this, a spec well as alternatives to raiding, constant power progression, and overall reasons to log in day after day, and players just bash the product made the way they wanted it.<br />

It's not like he was a low level grunt. He was the lead designer for PvP. It's his job title, or was. He was in charge, and approved all of it. He managed the team that designed it.

So you just made it up. <br />
<br />
And no, a heavy focus on multiplayer interaction is exactly what blizzard has been doing for ages now. A hero shooter is precisely within their usual playground, especially after they bridged the gap with HotS in the direct competitive and hero/class segments. Name dropping single player RPGS with ZERO online features is most definitely contrary to everything they've done.</div></div><hr />

I agree that he is one of the best Raid Designers... but his world design needs a lot of work. The storytelling is great but some of the questing (need 15 bear fur but not all bears have fur for some reason) is really old. Densely packed areas... making travel a chore is fine in a raid were you should be clearing trash... but under geared... while leveling... no thank you.</div></div><hr />

It's not like he was a low level grunt. He was the lead designer for PvP. It's his job title, or was. He was in charge, and approved all of it. He managed the team that designed it. He called the shots. His boss is Ion - Ion was most certainly not doing the design level work on PvP.<br />
<br />
Why do people keep putting ALL the blame on devs? Keep in mind, these guys are trying to find a balance in designing a game they want to play and make while giving players things they want. Players wanted a more stream lined and accessible PVP format that levels the playing field for all, and in giving that to the players they cry out &quot;devs ruined the game!&quot;<br />
It's just funny, tragic, and sad that this is an xpac designed for all the players that wanted things like this, a spec well as alternatives to raiding, constant power progression, and overall reasons to log in day after day, and players just bash the product made the way they wanted it.<br />
I literally look forward to the hilarity that will ensue for the bashing of the next person to step into the light of lead PVP design.<br />

I just don't pay that much attention to PvP related stuff because as I said I've always felt PvP to be pretty terrible in this game. Maybe that's a bit harsh but it always felt like an after thought and the nature of the game doesn't lend itself to this magical balanced fantasy world people are looking for.

&quot;A few weeks ago, I was offered a new opportunity at Blizzard that I’m really excited about.&quot;<br />
When was Destiny 2 announced to be on Battle.net.... A few weeks ago<br />
http://www.sherv.net/cm/emoticons/school/math-problem-smiley-emoticon.gif<br />
<br />
He isn't leaving Blizzard and Destiny 2 is developed by Bungie. come on folks this isn't rocket science. There is a huge difference between publishing a game and developing it.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
That wouldn't be at Blizzard though, Shitstainy 2 is made by another Studio under the ActiBliz umbrella.<br />
<br />
Bungie is under no one. They have full control over development and marketing of their games and Activision publishing Destiny 2 doesn't give them any power over Bungie or any of their games whatsoever. Please stop. None of this is remotely complicated or hard to understand.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think that Blizzard will allow any games on Battle.net and not have some input on the development ? He may not be involved with the game it's self, but the integration into the B.net system.<br />
<br />
That would involve the battle.net team not anyone on actual game development teams at Blizzard. Bungie has full control over development of Destiny 2 because it is THEIR game not Activision's. Publishing =/= development.</div></div><hr />

It's not like he was a low level grunt. He was the lead designer for PvP. It's his job title, or was. He was in charge, and approved all of it. He managed the team that designed it. He called the shots. His boss is Ion - Ion was most certainly not doing the design level work on PvP.<br />
<br />
There is more than one lead designer for pvp. Keep showing your ignorance though it is endlessly amusing.<br />

When Holinka dies, I swear to god I will find his grave and shit on the tombstone for the abortion that was Trashcan and pvp in WoD.<br />
<br />
What the fuck is wrong with you people?<br />

Wouldn't be surprised if someone tried to use this fact in pushing the agenda that WoW is dying, even though Holinka seems to have been REALLY disliked by the players mostly affected by his area.<br />
:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Give it a day or so and the haters will have tweaked their narrative to make this fit it.<br />

Finally. Get the hell off, maybe it's finally time to return to PvPing if it's returned to previous glory, no more template crap and normalized gear.<br />
<br />
I would rather Blizzard just delete pvp entirely from Wow.</div></div><hr />

Many of his decisions and things he was responsible for were questionable, sure, but this community is getting into the bad habit of making all lead devs pariahs.<br />

You haven't seen any of his interviews or Q&amp;As when he can't answer simple questions or doesn't know what is going on in the current state of the game. I am not saying I could or would do a better job, but that also isn't my field and there is a reason why I don't have that job. But hey if you don't want to hold the lead design accountable for his lack of follow through kudos to you, keep burring your head in the sand.<br />

Oh please. You and the rest of the chronic whiners here flip flop so much I don't think any of you actually have an actual opinion on anything and just hop onto whatever allows you to whine and bitch the most.<br />
<br />
Some yummy irony there. Going to need some cheese for that waterfall of whine you just made.</div></div><hr />

Instead of letting him continue to beat the dead horese WoW PVP is, we will now need to endure endless iterations of Blizzard's futile attempts to balance PVP (which is something I don't think can be done properly) while Holinka gets to fuck up something else.</div></div><hr />

I wonder who would replace him within the WoW team. We have seen how much things GC got blamed for came back in his departure. I am more worried it is the WoW team as a whole. Also Kalgan is no longer the director for WoW.</div></div><hr />

Yes, he was. Though i don't expect an mmo champion user to ever admit being wrong about anything.</div></div><hr />

He's the only one I know of who actually has experience with WoW PvP. Next guy would just break PvP until he can figure out what's wrong.

<br />
Either way, good luck in future positions Holinka.</div></div><hr />
