<br />
Wowprogress counts the 25 best geared in the guild Mythic is 20 man and Paragon only have around 21-22 raiders, so best geared people numbers 23, 24 and 25 drag the average ilevel down a chunk. They said themselves nobody was below 670.</div></div><hr />

You've hit on exactly my point. I enjoy playing WoW and other games but I find it sad how much time these top guilds spend getting world first kills. Imagine what they could accomplish if they spent that time doing productive things, instead of playing video games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Productive things like that? Sitting watching TV?<br />
<br />
People don't spend every waking moment being productive, they have time set aside to relax, enjoy entertainment or whatever. They've spent a shit load of time on it this week, next week will be less, the week after less. A week or two every 6 month of heavy pushing (bearing in mind it's been like 15 month since SoO launch too) isn't that strange.</div></div><hr />

When hasn't a world first involved exploits, either minor or major?<br />

I think it's funny that Blizzard still allows pre-potting and that players actually believe it's not exploiting. It would be a lot more simple just to make it so using a potion (that shares the combat penalty) puts you in combat.<br />

You've completely missed my point or you're being intentionally obtuse. Asking me what I've accomplished in WoW when I've clearly made it a point to criticize those who spend a majority of their lives trying to accomplish things in WoW is hilarious.

<br />
I think the problem is you assume they've spent massive amounts of time on the game and do not have lives and do nothing productive, based purely on their being successful. If you put in the same number of hours as them and achieved in game less, does that make you better than them, worse than them, or the same.<br />

That sort of depends. I mean, just to argue here, but watching DIY channels and shows on the food network can give you great ideas on how to improve your house and cooking style.</div></div><hr />

Asking me what I've accomplished in WoW when I've clearly made it a point to criticize those who spend a majority of their lives trying to accomplish things in WoW is hilarious. Don't try to criticize the opinions of someone by trying to compare their accomplishments, that they clearly see no value in, to those they are themselves criticizing.<br />
<br />
How is it hilarious that they achieve something in WoW? They get sponsors, they have people who hail them for what they achieve..<br />
<br />
I think they achieve a lot more then you do, from playing WoW.<br />
<br />
Which kinda leaves us with, you critizing, someone for being passionate, while having no real argument other then &quot;I find that sad&quot;.<br />
<br />
Which, is very regressive thinking. Extremely narrow-minded.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because that's what I meant :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I was equating it to other things they could be doing, what should they be doing? They spend a chunk of time on video games when they should instead be in a lab trying to cure cancer? What are you doing right now? You're typing messages into this thread, that's not productive, you should leave and go do something productive.</div></div><hr />

its a shame that Messi or Lebron james are spending so much time on their sports... imagine what they could accomplish if thery spend that time doing productive things, instead of playing sports.....<br />

Analogies like that only work when the person you're talking to finds value in the comparative subject. Sports are equally as ridiculous and serve no real purpose except for the entertainment of others.</div></div><hr />

Sports have historically actually had political bearings, but i guess just being pointlessly cynical and tunnel-visioned on &quot;Anything i don't approve of, is sad and pointless&quot; is a thing now.</div></div><hr />

If you put in the same number of hours as them and achieved in game less, does that make you better than them, worse than them, or the same.<br />
<br />
Entertainment is an integral part of life, what would being 100% productive be like for that person.<br />
<br />
No, based on the knowledge of their raiding schedules and how much time they put into playing. <br />
<br />
&quot;If you put in the same number of hours as them and achieved in game less, does that make you better than them, worse than them, or the same.&quot; - Probably worse, because for your investment you've benefited less.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't call it shocking; predictable is more like it. People are intolerant of those who don't share their opinions. Take a look at religion if you want a great example.

<br />
I think it's funny that Blizzard still allows pre-potting and that players actually believe it's not exploiting. It would be a lot more simple just to make it so using a potion (that shares the combat penalty) puts you in combat.<br />
<br />
Players should be glad they even have their current mod freedom.<br />
<br />
But don't worry, the angry shouting minority will come to its defense as always.<br />
<br />
Until it's messaged by Blizzard to be an exploit... it's not an exploit. You saying that it is doesn't grant validity to your statement. It's okay though. You have to vent about something, so it might as well be this. And yes. I am in the angry, shouting minority group... I guess... maybe... Okay I don't know what you mean, but whatever, I'll go with it :D<br />

Not in the slightest. I'm saying you wouldn't go into a church to tell them god doesn't exist, so why would you then come into this thread to tell them they're a bunch of sad gets who need to do something more productive?<br />
<br />
Why, in your example, did you bother telling those Christians you didn't believe in god, especially if you expected that they would then have a go at you for the next hour. Why would you not just get on with your life.<br />
<br />
Why so much negativity.<br />

Defensive? Do you lack the perception, to differentiate - what a observation is, and a personal attack?<br />
<br />
Your logic is flawed, your sentiments filled with ignorance and assertions that further more display that ignorance.<br />
<br />
It's not about &quot;what you think&quot;, or what &quot;idea&quot; you yield. If you are wrong, by LOGIC, i will very well discuss that - and point out thoose flaws that your ideas yield. Which, i have done.<br />
<br />
That has NOTHING to do with what you think - Nor does it call for that you involve your personal frustration with statements such as &quot;Get over it kid&quot; - It does not strengthen your arguments. Quite the opposite.</div></div><hr />

Don't try to criticize the opinions of someone by trying to compare their accomplishments, that they clearly see no value in, to those they are themselves criticizing.<br />
<br />
Contrary to what you seem to think, these people have jobs, and are productive members of society.<br />
<br />
The difference is, they choose to spend their leisure time being excellent at a game. You, on the other hand, are spending your free time, complaining about how others spend their free time, and if we're keeping score. I think sitting in front of a computer being grumpy that someone chose to spend their free time on a video game, instead of what you arbitrarily deem to be &quot;productive&quot; is a bit more sad than just choosing to have fun.<br />
<br />
These guys do not get paid to play, they are not sponsored, I'm wanting to say it was in wotlk maybe? that they actually had scheduling conflicts with raid times because some members' shifts on jobs made it so they had to start later, it's not like they called into work, they were still &quot;productive&quot; who cares if they're not out curing cancer, it's their free time, they have fun, you're allowed to do the same.</div></div><hr />

Oh I don't know, considering WP can and has been wrong before? it's shown guilds with people at 550 and under/above killing Heroic bosses. All they have to do is wear lesser gear and log out, it's pretty simple.</div></div><hr />

Nice<br />
<br />
They had the same iLvl as other top guilds. WoWProg counts iLvl of 25 highest iLvl people. Paragon only had 21 geared people(of which 1 had to sat on bench all of progress). So they never changed their raid comp.</div></div><hr />

That's quite a jump there; playing video games straight to curing cancer. The point that I think I've made pretty clearly is that I think that spending the amount of time that guilds like Method and Paragon do on video games is sad. Mainly because I clearly don't find that much value in playing video games almost as much as an actual job. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy WoW and I play my fair share; however, it's a hobby, not a life style.</div></div><hr />

I don't know (and don't care enough to look) but some of the really serious guilds on my server have spent tens of millions of gold to equip themselves fully with all the various 665+ BOEs floating around. I'm talking about serious amounts of gold spent. So &quot;Not even geared up&quot; could still mean WAY more f'n geared than I am.</div></div><hr />

They know as much or more about it than the developers. The only way for Blizzard to make encounters that are unbeatable is to do just that. Make the dps check ridiculous. Like everyone has to do 80k dps single target. Or 100k or 120k. Otherwise, they can't make mechanics that the likes of Paragon or Method or Ascendance won't be able to beat. Maybe in prior expansions when the game wasn't as well understood, but you're talking about people who have probably been playing the game for 10 years. Some of them playing it together that long (I'm guessing).<br />
<br />
The fact is, 99.9% of the guilds won't clear Mythic before the next dungeon is out. We shouldn't judge the raid design harshly because a few guilds can do it very quickly. For the vast majority of players, even heroic is a challenge. Normal Imperator is pretty difficult right now IMO. My guild is 2/7 heroic and the fights just aren't super easy. They are well-designed and it will take most guilds a while to clear it.</div></div><hr />

Always laugh at these sort of comments, people not knowing anything about the game what so ever.<br />
<br />
The competetion has NEVER been this tight as it is today, if you put the top 20 guilds back in time to do whatever raids took 3 months (like lichking) they would kill it within a reset or two aswell.<br />
<br />
People's skill level is so much higher than it was in Vanila and TBC, and today topend guilds raid up to 17-18 hours a day, noone did that back in the days, some even use focus enhancement drugs (like blood legion last tier with adderal). Theres no way you can compare the stage of the game 6 years ago to the stage it is at now.</div></div><hr />

I am most certain they spend less time overall on raid tiers than 95% of the raiding guilds out there. I would gladly take a week off to clear it all and then go back to 1 night clears of Mythic (or something like that).

<br />
You're the person who's made, by far, the most generalizations and ad-hominem attacks in this entire thread. You give all these overly thought-out responses, but you completely fail to grasp the point of the same petty argument you yourself made. How is them spending a week fully dedicated to something they are passionate about any more sad than you spending a few hours mocking them on a thread? They are actually doing something they love and getting recognized for it. You, on the other hand, are simply drawing the ire of people for what exactly, to prove that you don't play the game that much? How does that make you superior? You don't waste time on the game, but you sure do waste it here. They on the other hand don't waste their leisure time attacking others' accomplishments.<br />
<br />
Also, since you don't seem to have a clue, the GM and tank of Method (who were 1st in progression before being beaten by Paragon) is a financial analyst and apparently still has enough time to be inside the gym enough to be built like a truck. I'm sure not every world class raider can boast his life, but terrible assumptions just make you seem like a bitter person projecting his wishful superiority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You do realize that many of those in this screenshot are not only players that have achieved top 0.5% in Rated Battlegrounds, but are also multi Gladiators w/ 2700+ rating in arena as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When hasn't a world first involved exploits, either minor or major?<br />
<br />
I think it's funny that Blizzard still allows pre-potting and that players actually believe it's not exploiting. It would be a lot more simple just to make it so using a potion (that shares the combat penalty) puts you in combat.<br />
<br />
Players should be glad they even have their current mod freedom.<br />
<br />
But don't worry, the angry shouting minority will come to its defense as always.<br />
<br />
Yea..... you're the minority, sorry. If you think pre-potting allows that much of an advantage on an encounter... then I just can't face palm hard enough. <br />

The competetion has NEVER been this tight as it is today, if you put the top 20 guilds back in time to do whatever raids took 3 months (like lichking) they would kill it within a reset or two aswell.<br />
<br />
People's skill level is so much higher than it was in Vanila and TBC, and today topend guilds raid up to 17-18 hours a day, noone did that back in the days, some even use focus enhancement drugs (like blood legion last tier with adderal). Theres no way you can compare the stage of the game 6 years ago to the stage it is at now.<br />

You've hit on exactly my point. I enjoy playing WoW and other games but I find it sad how much time these top guilds spend getting world first kills. Imagine what they could accomplish if they spent that time doing productive things, instead of playing video games.<br />

How much of a fucking moron can you be. Lich King had a huge gating system where only one wing would be released at a time, hence making Lich King not even accessible until over a month after Lord Marrowgar. FURTHERMORE, a guild could only attempt a MAXIMUM OF 50 attempts per week on end wing bosses (that's all combined, not per boss). ICC was the most gated instance in the game by far which is why it lasted several months.<br />
<br />
Also, look back at vanilla/tbc/wotlk etc and there were NO ALT RAIDS. These guilds have cleared heroic highmaul a total of 10 times in 2 weeks. THEY HAVE TEN WEEKS WORTH OF LOOT you moron. Back in the day there was no alt raiding, meaning guilds weren't overgeared like today.<br />
<br />
The content isn't poorly balanced, nor are these players simply 'too good,' gear funneling through alt raids is simply too overpowered.</div></div><hr />

I see you're one of those smart guys. What you define as productive in life has no bearing on what others do in theirs. Free, hobby time is exactly what WoW is. If you have less time for hobbies than maybe you need to manage your time better.<br />
<br />
Do think if these 20 people stop playing WoW they will solve world hunger, cure ebola and discover the riddle of autism? No. Not a single one of these people will make a difference in the big picture today, tomorrow or this year. I'll bet that neither will you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually they spend less time on progression than most guilds. Because if you actually thought about it, they go through it all in a week or so very intensely and very organized but then they're done until the next tier. Where as most guilds are still trying to move through the content for months. I know most of the top guilds go down to 1 raid day per week when content is on farm.<br />
<br />
Also, a hobby is a hobby and I don't see why people think it's so bad to work hard to accomplish a goal in something you like. There are people out there shooting basketballs through hoops and pucks into nets for a living, it's not any more relevant than this, people just like to distort what's important because money is involved. I can guarantee you that the feeling they get when they finally overcome something they worked so hard for and being the first worldwide to do it, makes it all worth it for them, and it's a similar feeling to a sports team winning a championship, a feeling most will never understand or get to experience.<br />

The way they contact the beta tests shows pure greed and incompetence . Instead of hiring a decent beta testing team they ruin the game experience by making extensive and detailed beta versions of the game. And then people are talking about world firsts and other misguided nonsense... not convincing or interesting enough for me</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's ridiculous that the hardest content can be cleared the 1st week its open, even if it is by the best players the game has.<br />
<br />
Thy started the race in ilv 655 or so gear...less than other guilds. The bump obviously came from the gear that dropped?<br />
<br />
As for your other point: They can clear that content, because those guilds are indeed THE BEST. And because beating these bosses needs insane skill over gear. Is that not how it should be?<br />
<br />
Everything else would involve some kind of gating, including gating it behind a dps requirement that can only be achieved in full BiS. (like Lich King, who also had a 50 attempt limit)<br />
<br />
Which offers the next problem: Nobody except the best 10-20 guilds could clear mythic if involves both: Insane skill and mythic BiS gear. I am sure some people would like this concept, others would be so frustrated that they drop raiding when they cleared heroics.</div></div><hr />

no they started race in ~670 ilvl. They wrote on their page that they had +20 people who help them make 7HC raids in first week (on each u take only 3 main grp characters and they take all loot). It's normal that if u want to participate in world race u must have 5+ alts geared and ready on the first HC week to gear up all main characters. Normal guild who raid 4x4 or 4x5 will need ~5-6 weeks to gear up on hc to their race starting gear.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if I want a boss that gives these guilds much trouble. When Paragon or Method or whoever needs 3 month to down a boss everyone else in the world will never ever kill it until the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Exactly,what a bunch of sad no lifers! And calling them best at the game because they cleared something first is even sadder,they aren't the best at all they just bother to play the game like mad men because they have no lives at all and spend it all racing to something with no reward.

That’s just the stupidest load of dumb I’ve ever read. Are you 12, or mentally retarded? You can say the same about absolutely anything on the planet. A top London Lawyer isn’t one of the best Lawyers, he just studied law like a sad no lifer. <br />

<br />
Thanks I was wondering how they geared up so fast. I find it amazing how they are able to put this kind of time in. Its really impressive the dedication they have.<br />
<br />
Also to all those people that think they should of took longer to clear this content. Please keep in mind that these guids work with the developers to tune the content in beta.<br />
<br />
Blizzard designs the content so these guilds can beat it. Beacuse if they can't beat it then all the rest of us would not have a chance and all the QQ'ing would be rampant. <br />
<br />
Also note that if u have a solid group of 20 playes it would take around 6 weeks to gear up. Most guilds cant run 7 Heroics clears a week and give the gear to only 2-3 people to gear up. <br />
<br />
Grates to these amazing players that are able to do what they love!!! Most of us arn't so lucky, were jellious and thats why u see all the complaints.</div></div><hr />

Although they didnt have lower ilvl than other top guilds while getting these kills. People seem to check wowprogress ilvldata but they forget Paragon has much smaller team unlike other top guilds who tend to have many benches. They raid with a fixed 20 people roster. <br />
<br />
If you can check their roster you can see top 20 has ilvl average of 673. 21th to 25th highest ilvls in Paragon is 657-653-653-652-652, and if you check further you can see they are all alts. As wowprogress averages top 25 highest ilvl Paragon's ilvl in rankings suddenly drops to 668.</div></div><hr />
