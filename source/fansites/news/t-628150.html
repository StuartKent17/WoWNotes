Burst damage in Arenas<br />
Totally agree that the matches like you are describing can involve a lot of skill. But we also heard from plenty of players during the heydey of maxed out resilience that they felt like they couldn't compete because pure damage dealing wasn't of much use in an Arena. Instead, every class was asking for CC, counter CC, ways to close the gap, ways to interrupt or silence, etc. Damage itself was devalued. Even today you can see players who are glad to no longer have 20+ minute Arenas that feel more like chess matches.<br />
<br />
Things may be too bursty now, but I think we've also been in a state where CC'ing or draining the healer was basically the whole game too. I think there is a sweet spot somewhere, but I didn't want players to think that was a very different place than what we thought. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13909426107-are-you-kidding-me-seriously.html))<br />
<br />
Resilience and burst damage<br />
<br />
It is hard to nail the sweet spot on Arena balance, and what that sweet spot is depends a lot on what role you play. At times players have felt that they couldn't prevent someone from healing, which turns the entire fight into mana draining, silence and crowd control, since nobody ever dies. Damage-dealers were frustrated because they felt like just beating on someone (which their entire spec may have been designed around) was ineffective. Currently, the opposite is true, where players can be beaten down very quickly and healers tend to wonder why they should even bother trying to heal.<br />
<br />
Resilience will make a difference - remember that not only is PvP gear itemized for resilience, but it uses up points that would normally be spent on +dps. The defenses are not only higher, but the offenses are lower. Furthermore, once players can survive for a few seconds, it tends to force everyone to worry about defenses once again. Will resilience make enough of a difference? That is something we are discussing right now.<br />
<br />
We hear and understand all of the concerns. I don't have any announcements to make of changes at this time, and honestly changes of the magnitude we're talking would not be the kind of thing I would just casually drop as an answer to a forum thread like this. But we do hear you. <br />
<br />
[...] While that was true to an extent, if you look at the Lich King PvP gear, you'll see that it pays a higher price for resilience. In previous seasons, you could get very high dps and resilience on the same set of gear. That is harder to do now. Rogues, like everyone else, will be risking being very fragile if they go with all PvE gear for the damage. That isn't happening now because very few people have much PvP gear. Once players can survive a few hits, then players without resilience are going to go down quickly.<br />
<br />
(Weapons are an exception to this, at least for now.)<br />
<br />
Again, I'm not saying that burst damage won't still be too high. That is something we're looking at. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13909386074-gc-rumors.html))<br />
<br />
Arenas and skill measurement<br />
We like Arenas, and clearly a lot of players do too. What we don't like about them is they really put class balance under a microscope. Ultimately we'd like to see the pendulum on PvP swing back a little closer to Battlegrounds and even world PvP. We think the BGs actually encompass the story of Warcraft (which is essentially Horde vs. Alliance) much better than do the Arenas.<br />
<br />
Where the Arena currently beats the pants off the BG is that we can detect player skill much better in an Arena. That in turn allows us to offer the best loot to the best players. BG rewards by contrast have traditionally felt very grindy.<br />
<br />
We do have some plans to change all of that. We don't have any intention of getting rid of Arenas for players that do enjoy that sort of gameplay. But we also want to give other players alternatives to still be able to get great rewards. <br />
<br />
[...] Class certainly has an effect on the outcome, which is why it is subject to such scrutiny. At the same time, I think there is something interesting to the whole comp strategy. I think we'd lose something if you could get any 3 random people together. I'm not saying certain classes should be doomed to failure. I'm saying who you get for your third should mean something. <br />
<br />
You actually feel that you can determine &quot;skill&quot; in an unbalanced RNG based game? <br />
Within the limitation of the tools, yes I think we can. You're talking down to an awful lot of gladiators out there if your argument is that they just picked the right class or got lucky with the RNG.<br />
<br />
If I took say a rogue-mage-priest team at the height of its power and played a team with the same gear and comp, I don't think the outcome would be 50/50 every time. If I took my team and played the best team in the world, I would expect to get stomped. That's skill. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13908766368-why-arena-is-bad-for-wow.html))<br />
<br />
Crowd Control<br />
CC isn't a bad concept. But damage isn't a bad concept either. We designed quite a few specs to focus on dealing damage, and when they don't think that's effective, they get just as grumpy (and understandably so) and feel like their spec needs some new tool to shut down the healer.<br />
<br />
I'm not talking about the state of S5 specifically or the S2-S4 for that matter. I'm just saying that in general there should be a place for crowd control and for healing and for silencing and mana drain and also just plain killing someone. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13909296195-gc-im-very-very-worried.html))<br />
<br />
Talent builds<br />
We design the talent trees with specific builds in mind. We'll slide things up and down to make them more or less attractive to various cross-spec strategies.<br />
<br />
Players rarely surprise us with builds. When they do it's something like the Holy paladin that goes all the way down Ret but intends to heal like Holy, or the Elemental shaman who goes very deep in Enhancement.<br />
<br />
I should say players rarely surprise us with builds but they surprise us all the time in general. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13909386521-gc-do-you-know-what-specs-are-before-tc.html))<br />
<br />
Arena Matchmaking<br />
My point was that when the matchmaking is working well, it will pit you against players very close to your skill level. Playing players very close to your skill level increases the chance you will lose. The point is actually not to have the 2000+ players mowing their way through scrubs. It's to pair off the best teams against each other so that getting e.g. Gladiator means something.<br />
<br />
What I was actually getting at though was a loftier sentiment that players run through quests or an instance and one-shot everything and then go into PvP and can lose a lot. It's a very different experience, and psychologically I think it affects players more than they give it credit for. (If you are highly-ranked or don't even play PvE much then it likely affects you a lot less.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13909426245-are-you-kidding-me-seriously.html))<br />
<br />
Class balancing and player's feedback<br />
It is challenging to compare our numbers to those that come up from the community. Since I have been doing this gig, there have been plenty of times when players will say &quot;Yeah, we figured X was overpowered,&quot; but that is almost immediately followed by &quot;but the nerfs were too much.&quot; I have honestly yet to see more than one or two players ever agree that the magnitude of a nerf (any nerf) was justified. I'm just sayin.<br />
<br />
We have to rely on our testing more than the community. That's just the way it has to work. Your numbers, however, are a useful reality check. In situations where the community consistently finds different numbers, we might go check our numbers again. We will do so in this case.<br />
<br />
Something else worth pointing out is the whole concept of &quot;your mileage may vary.&quot; Not every player has the same timing, gear, situational awareness or even rotation. In many cases our calculations are based on the higher ends of the spectrum -- the damage potential generated by the best players in ideal situations. For a class like the hunter that does require a fairly high amount of skill to master that may mean that your damage didn't drop as much (because you weren't using a technique that the experts were using to coax every bit of dps out of their attacks) or your damage may drop a lot more (because the experts are able to switch to other sources of damage more readily than a less skilled player).<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is that WoW isn't such a simple game that a 10% buff or nerf done on our end will automatically result in a 10% buff or nef for every player out there in every situation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13909425894-can-we-get-gc-to-comment.html))<br />

Death Knight changes<br />
It's hard to take that 1% dps rule of thumb too far. For example, Howling Blast can do a lot of damage, but you have to consider how the DK would spend those runes if he or she had skipped that talent. Just because Howling Blast is 20% of your dps or whatever, does not mean the talent is a 20% dps incrase.<br />
<br />
Wandering Plague is probably okay and Gargoyle is probably too good. Necrosis and Blood-Caked Blade are probably better candidates to buff for Unholy (though there are some DW builds that get a lot more out of them).<br />
<br />
The DK talent tree is new and has't been subjected to anywhere near the scrutiny of the existing class talent trees. I'm a little surprised we haven't had to tweak it more than we have already, but I suspect more of that will be coming.

Feral tanking<br />
We don't really apply a penalty to Feral tanks to make up for the fact that they have Rebirth. (We don't really apply a penalty to Prot warriors to make up for their shouts.)<br />
<br />
I recently said in another thread that druids can do a lot of different things well and when doing those things they have a lot less overlap in abilities used than warriors, paladins and death knights. For that reason, we don't want to keep giving bears more and more abilities. We don't want druids to be the class with 120 abilities while every other class has 30. Rebirth is in your spellbook and probably on your bar (and you have probably even clicked it) even though it isn't a tanking tool like Demo Roar or Barkskin. Different classes do have different abilities, and we want to keep as much of that flavor as we can.<br />
<br />
We want to have four classes that can main tank (given appropriate skill and gear). We're pretty close to that right now, but we'll have to see what things look like in the next tier of content. It's possible the gear available then or the types of encounters you experience change the playing field a little, in which case we'll have to make adjustments.

Hunter pets and paladin buffs<br />
Okay, the issue is that paladin buffs are class based, which is funky with regard to pets. Got it. I'll put it on the list. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13908766053-gc-hunter-pet-paladin-buffing.html))<br />

Shadow PvP<br />
With regard to Shadow PvP, as a few players have suggested, the question is always whether to buff or to nerf to bring everyone up to the same level. Players would always prefer buffs, and frankly so would we, but sometimes it can be orders of magnitude more work to do so (when you start talking about inflating mob health across the board for example). If incoming damage were lower, through whatever solution, would Shadow priests be able to do their job?<br />
<br />
Dispersion is a new ability, and like many of the new abilities, it's going to take some test driving before we're entirely happy with it. The spell still comes up a lot in our design discussions. I'm not going to risk saying anything beyond that until we have something more concrete to offer. I am sorry to sound so guarded at times, but honeslty, players can get really upset if they feel they were promised something that for whatever reason we end up not delivering.

Demonic Circle and Warlock changes<br />
Teleport breaking snares is something we're discussing.<br />
<br />
As I've said, we want to make some changes to the warlock class for a future patch. Since those changes will take some time and testing, we are also going to try for some more band-aid level fixes that can go live much more quickly. You will doubtless see lots of (less-informed) players say &quot;That's it?&quot; to which you can reply (if you so choose) that no, that's not it, but a handful of quick changes (such as perhaps teleport breaking snare) that we thought we could safely make while we are looking at the larger issues.<br />
<br />
When we have the &quot;sooner&quot; changes finalized, we'll announce them. When we have the &quot;later&quot; changes finalized, we'll announce them too. Ideally those &quot;later&quot; changes can come out at the same time as Ulduar, but we'll see.<br />
<br />
I also don't want anyone to think this was the only post on warlock (largely PvP) issues that we've read lately. There have been some insightful comments and good ideas on several threads, mixed in of course with the traditional QQ. For those of you who made the good posts, we thank you.

Fury aggro issues and PvE/PvP threads<br />
My comment about Fury pulling aggro was to suggest that they also can be very RNG and burst-heavy and therefore maybe it is a warrior issue and not an Arms issue.<br />
<br />
Aside: You may have noticed I do tend to bring up PvP issues in PvE threads and vice versa. My purpose is to gently remind players that despite your individual interests, that we must take both ways to play into consideration whenever we make changes. In my effort to post as much as I am able I sometimes type too quickly, but I'll try to be more clear.

Oh cruel irony my friend, you've done it again!<br />

<br />
Resilience will make a difference - remember that not only is PvP gear itemized for resilience, but it uses up points that would normally be spent on +dps. The defenses are not only higher, but the offenses are lower. Furthermore, once players can survive for a few seconds, it tends to force everyone to worry about defenses once again. Will resilience make enough of a difference? That is something we are discussing right now.<br />
<br />
Resilience will help to a certain extend, but it's no miracle cure either. From a healer's perspective: damage across the board is just too high. Especially the damage of Melee classes.<br />
<br />
Why Melee classes ? Look at the World of Roguecraft episode where the creator of the video explains exactly how stats work, and how they are working double for these classes. It still applies to this very day.<br />
<br />
World of Meleecraft will continue it's Legacy through 2009.</div></div><hr />

my question is: do they even test the game at all?<br />

because, and a vast majority will agree on this, being a healer now is almost close to useless in PvP, specially arenas.<br />

Why dont the dev's grab a rogue or paladin in blue gear, and instagib some cloth's to see what they turned pvp into?<br />

<br />
Arena's main problem is class balance, and it they have been goofing around with classes and messing them up in the name of Arena ever since Season 1. It seems like they are finally saying, &quot;Ok, there really isn't a way to put all the classes on equal footing without completely screwing up the game&quot;.

wotlk arena is the same easy shit for melee jibs and requires no timing or proper skill.<br />

<br />
Its like they are listening to scrubs which might seem like a good idea to the CEO because that's the majority of the player base and the $$$, but its usually has a reverse effect on a game.<br />
<br />
Making things easy and lame hurts everyone and all those scrub complainers will now have nothing to aspire to and soon find it as uninteresting. Every player likes a challenge and getter better at their class/comp, even the scrubs who complain.<br />

<br />
First, they want Naxx to be easy because so few got to see it in classic WoW. Also, it is basically the Karazhan of WotLK. An introductory raid, if you will.<br />
<br />
Second, it seems they are defending themselves on an almost daily basis about the ease of Naxx. I can see them wrenching up the difficulty in Ulduar just to shut up all the detractors. Sure, you can't please everyone, but I bet they will make Ulduar harder just to shut up the whiners. The casuals will be happy farting around Naxx for months and months to come, so they probably won't whine too much if Ulduar is much harder.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ylandria</div><div class="date">2008-12-29, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will admit that Arena takes more skill than BG's, but don't think for a minute that it is some sort of ultimate test of skill and strategy.<br />
<br />
Arena's main problem is class balance, and it they have been goofing around with classes and messing them up in the name of Arena ever since Season 1. It seems like they are finally saying, &quot;Ok, there really isn't a way to put all the classes on equal footing without completely screwing up the game&quot;. I'm glad to see they acknowledge that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, first of all. Saying that BG require more strategy then arena just show how clueless you are and that you most likely havent been high rated, ever. Atleast in TBC, what made a good warrior was a warrior that was good on making strategys and was good on reading the game. Also, from my experience a good warrior is usealy also the &quot;leader&quot; of the team in arena. Because if ppl assist him and do what he says it will make you win. <br />
<br />
Also, arena havent had THAT much problems with class balance befor now. Only reason that it was class issues was that some classes had less ppl playing em(hunters, shamans), also their classes had a bigger skill cap then f.ex warriors and rogues. But that dosnt mean that their class sucks, but because of all the noobs (like 90% or more of ppl playing that class) that is whining on the forums about how bad their class is. Then Blizzard reduce the skill-cap of their class rather then accualy balancing the game. Meaning that if you were good befor, the gap between a noob and the best of the class in the world gets alot smaller. Again, meaning that if you'r good the chances of you being able to do something in arena when you get ownd is smaller, because now that the skill cap is lower you cant do much then spamming the face-roll buttons. <br />
<br />
Now, you have a class balance issue. <br />
I mean, look at warriors. They got bladestorm, this skill is no way based on any skill at all. <br />
Mages got arcane spec, killing healers befor imp counterspell goes off. Frost however requires some skill, but that spec is crap compered to arcane, because this spec dosnt have any face-roll skills that one shot ppl.<br />
Rogues doing insane burst dmg by clicking 2 buttons, really who cant do that if they just got the gear? Also, rogues die really fast, so even if you are skilled you cant do much then face-roll the burst. <br />
Hunters, everything is instant you can just run around face-roll your key-board and you have 2x Beastal Wrath (getting nerfed, but still). Again this makes it harder for the skilled hunters that knew how to play good hunter in TBC, because back then it required lots of coordination to kill someone. But now every noob can do it.<br />
Shamans, one thing that made a good shaman in TBC was that if he knew how to time his global-cooldowns so he could shock a CC and now own himself cause of that. Also they way you had to control your totems also had a huge difference on how the game would turn out, now they removed all that, making it alot easier for the noobs to do good. And harder for the skilled ppl to make a difference. This class is kinda broke, but the skill-cap still ruins the whole class in PvP. <br />
Paladins, now they are really OP. Befor they were crap because they couldnt move while healing, but geez. Did you have to make em able to just run around like a head-less chicken and cast instant heals. And the silly part is that in most cases you'll just get ownd if you try to cast a heal instead of just spamming instants (except if you have holy light proc, meaning its almost impossible to interrupt cause of lag). Again, makes it alot easier for all noobs. I agree that they should make palas more viable when it comes to being able to move around and healing, but they should atleast HAVE to cast a heal once in a while.<br />
Druids, they are just really bad atm. In most cases its better to hug around in tree-form and spam hots then going out and CC. Because if you go into normal form you get insta gibbed. AGAIN, meaning that the skilled druids get hit in the face by blizzard, because that was what made a good druid in TBC. <br />
Priests, meh dunno much about them. They are kinda bad in PvP, but dont wanna say much about their skill-cap since I dont know much about em. <br />
Warlocks, again they are just really bad. Their skill-cap might not be that bad, but we'll see once they arnt so gimp anymore.<br />
DK's, just plain OP. They never die and they deserve a BIG nerf, I rolled DK from being a Warrior hoping that a DK would require more skill then a warrior to play. But I guess I was wrong, cause DK's require no skill what-so-ever. And this is so clear when I meet top 10 teams with DK's in em and its not even fun playing em because they usealy are really really bad, still they are top 10. Skill-cap, hello?<br />
<br />
I mean, one thing that is gonna ruin PvP in this game is the skill-caps. If blizzard dont do anything about it, LOADS of the good PvP'ers will get frustrated and just quit.</div></div><hr />

I didnt say that I havent experienced any class balance issues befor. I said that ppl were able to still do good in arena even if their class wasnt as OP as other ppl. But look now, 60/100 top 100 teams in the world got a DK in it. It have NEVER been as bad as it is right now, and atleast every class had a combo that you could get top 5 with in your BG if you were really good. I mean, it have been setups that was anti to many other setups. But this is just stupid, because now loads of good ppl that were rank 1 in my BG loads of times befor is stuck at like 1800 because they keep getting one-shotted by noobs.

Wasn't Arena the infamous pvp mode where you could just BUY your rating (or &quot;ranked achievement&quot;)? Doing well could say that 1) you're good at it, 2) you bought it or 3) You're not exactly good, but run a &quot;default&quot; comp.<br />
<br />
But I agree with the fact that what was easy, now it's ridiculous easy. The rating system was the last chance of saving the arena system, but Blizz couldn't stay quiet and improve it, they needed to just f&amp;%$ it up by giving the same pieces with ridiculous cost (or not at all *cof* VoA raid *cof*) withou any rating requiriment on it.<br />
<br />
Who would think that one day Arenas would not be = easy pvp epics anymore... there is something worse.<br />
<br />
Wonder if Blizz can score a &quot;Fatality&quot; by upgrading the loot table on VoA to drop S6 and T8 in a few months... lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it was. Druids, Druids/SpamstringWarriors (or lolskillheraldwarriors) for entire seasons, not just a few weeks into a new one (and with classes way older then the brand new DK, their OPness came from way before Season 1).<br />
<br />
DKs happen to just screw Druids really hard, that's all :) They're like a Druid on steroids (or even old Locks if you prefer).<br />
<br />
If the player was really good (and not a old OP class user), he can get out of it and make his way back to the top. That's the meaning of GOOD.<br />
<br />
If he was good only at using a OP class or unbalanced skill/talent, then there is nothing he can do about it at the moment that he's not OP anymore or get fixed.</div></div><hr />

I would like then to stop comparing Naxx to Ulduar. Naxx beeing easy never was the problem, but the entire Raid content.<br />
<br />
Ulduar isn't the next step after Naxx, there are other Raids between those two and their lack of challenge is the problem.<br />

I would be really worried if Blizz can't make Ulduar harder then Naxx and just a &quot;sidestep raid&quot;...</div></div><hr />

I play a DK, so my point isnt &quot;LOL I GET OWND, LETS NERF DK's&quot;. But its no fun playing when you dont fight good ppl, just nabbs playing DK/retpala and getting high. And when they meet me playing DK/holypala (ye ye, ez-mode combo) its really lols watching how much they fail. They just go &quot;LOL STUN AND KILL&quot;, and when it dosnt work its like they got no idea wtf to do. <br />
<br />
Meh, imo back in s1 and s2. Reason for class balance was cause ppl played weird combos and almost everyone didnt know how to play arena, now ppl got loads of experience and its still way inbalanced. Wich makes it alot easier then the inbalance we had back in season 1. <br />
<br />
Also, the ppl I am talking about isnt ppl who got high cause of their class. You get to 2k if you'r crap, but play OP setup. You dont get rank 1 MANY times, that means that you play an OP class, but you'r good at it. And just cause you played an OP class dosnt mean that you shouldnt have a chance getting high once the class isnt OP anymore. <br />

My apologies. For some reason I thought Ulduar came after Naxx. I didn't know that there were other raids in-between.<br />
<br />
I still say the first post-Naxx raid will be a bit harder than Naxx due to all the crying about Naxx being too easy. That, and it's probably in Blizzard's interest to throw up a bit of a cockblock to amuse the non-casuals. I still say casuals will be happy in Naxx for quite a bit of time to come.</div></div><hr />

Sure DK's may screw resto druids and boomkins hard, however, they do that to all caster classes, so it really isn't an argument about DK's vs druids, it DK's vs casters. That needs to be clear.<br />
<br />
That said, my concerns are mainly about arena and balance seems to be more along the lines that healears and range are getting pushed out right now. And granted less resillience is making a difference, however, even if you had 700 resillience, how much of a difference would it make? As a shaman, my toon got stunlocked and dead inside of 2 seconds, add solid resil and hp's would I last over 2 seconds? I would still be stunlocked, thus not able to do anything to counter.and as thus, still most likely instagibbed+ .5 secs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was somewhat true during s1 and s2 but not s3 and s4, They did fix it, you could not buy rating and still cant. Also carrying someone isn't as easy as people think. You couldn't just buy your rating and stand there like a newb. Sure some people in 3's or 5's could promise certain gear (usually a 1850 rating ) because they were highly skilled but its not like any of the real competitive 2100+ teams were selling rating, you had to have very member be very good or you didn't stand a chance.<br />
<br />
Right now arena is so bad I can so that its way easier to carry someone for gear, just team up with some dps and sit back and watch the rating roll in.</div></div><hr />

Well of course, that's very easy coming from a Warrior's mouth. What hard rough patch did you every have to go through in the history of this game.<br />
<br />
Try playing a Priest or a Warlock right now and tell me everything's just dandy. Sure, Warlocks had their hayday in TBC, but Priests have been begging Blizzard for something, anything, at least a bone to throw our way for over 2 years now.<br />
<br />
Yet what do we get patch after patch? Nerf, nerf, nerf, nerf, insignificant small buff that no one asked for, nerf, nerf, another insignificant buff, nerf, nerf, nerf, big buff that no one asked for and that they take away 3 months later, nerf...<br />

Hell, these forums makes me sad nowadays. I still enjoy the game, don't I? So why when I come here, it just feels like this game is trash? Its all because of the player's reactions here. And I wish it stopped.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is nice to see someone who too is tired of this worthless bitching everywhere. &quot;WAA WAA, I don't like this, WAA WAA I don't like that, WAA WAA class X needs buffs, WAA WAA class Y needs nerfs!&quot;. I have a good answer, and I will let you know, that GC is saying the very same thing, only in a very polite way. The answer is &quot;If you don't like this game, GTFO&quot;. Simple. See that Unsubscribe button in your Account Management page? Press it. Do us all a favor and quit this game. Honestly, if you are getting pissed constantly about every single thing blues say, why play the game? Why pay those 15$ a month?<br />
<br />
Sadly the WoW playerbase is heavily inflicted with the plague of entitlement, and it applies to hardcore players as well, not just casuals, as some might believe. If anything, entitled hardcores are worse. Far, far worse. Seriously people, grow a pair and either quit or shut up.</div></div><hr />

WoW is a paid entertainment service. And just like any other service, its users are entitled to comment and criticize.<br />
<br />
You act like Blizzard has never done anything based on player feedback. Ever hear of the PTR? Apparently not, because anyone who has wouldn't make such an ignorant post. Blizzard wants feedback to make their game better, and they've shown time and time again that they want to improve. Sometimes the community may be more violent in their arguments in attempts to get Blizz to listen up.<br />
<br />
If you like the game the way it is, fine, keep playing. No one is forcing you to read the forums. Why are you even here reading blue posts if you think the game's fine? Go back to playing...</div></div><hr />

Yes, they are entitled to comment and criticize. In a perfect world, Blizzard would get only constructive feedback. However, every monkey with a keyboard that plays this game, considers, that THEIR vision of the game is the right one and the game should be shaped to THEIR whim. Comments? Have you even READ the forums? Come on, the forums is the real PvP, a retard contest who has the loudest mouth, you name it. It is pretty much anything but civilized discussion, with several rare exceptions (rare truly constructive and good criticism in the enormous sea of tears).<br />

Blizzard wants feedback to their game, and they get it. They are listening. However, it does not mean they will do what you, your mom or your dog says about this game and do it that way.</div></div><hr />
