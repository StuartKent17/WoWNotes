Siege of Orgrimmar Heroic Progression<br />
Method (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/twisting-nether/Method/rating.tier16_25) is leading progress tonight, with 11/14 bosses down. Blood Legion (, closing a gap from earlier in the night at 8/14 bosses) has managed to kill one more boss since last night, now with 10/14 bosses down. Over in the 10 player column, Paragon (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/lightning-s-blade/Paragon/rating.tier16_10) is currently leading with 9/14 bosses down, followed by Sanitas (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/frostwhisper/Sanitas/rating.tier16_10), also at 9/14.<br />

PvP Season 14 Begins<br />
Season 14 is live in the US and EU, so get to work on your Season 14 Armor Set (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/373-Season-14-Armor-Sets)! The new individual ladders (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/pvp/leaderboards/2v2) are in place and updating. <br />
With sharpened blades and well-honed spells, the time to strike has come! Season 14 has begun, and the leaders of the Horde and the Alliance are once again looking for new champions to carry their factions’ banners to victory!<br />
<br />
In PvP Season 14, you will no longer need to join or create an Arena team to compete, and thus the current Team Ratings will be removed. You’ll now be able to queue for an Arena match in groups of 2, 3, and 5 (in line with the Arena team sizes available in Season 13 and earlier), and your opponents will be selected based on the average Match Making Rating of your party. Personal ratings have been reset.<br />
<br />
You can find a complete overview of the changes in our Patch 5.4 Arena Update (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10333782) blog.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4 Resilience Changes<br />
The increase in base Resilience in patch 5.4 is meant to counterbalance the fact that Resilience is no longer on gear (and thus does not increase as players gear up).<br />
<br />
Prior to 5.3, players' survivability would naturally increase with gear. We didn't feel that that was creating an environment that would encourage undergeared players to continue playing, so in 5.3, we moved Resilience off of gear and increased base Resilience.<br />
<br />
In Patch 5.4, we needed to do something similar. Since player power is still increasing as players collect more gear, we needed to once again increase base resilience to keep things from getting too out of hand. You'll still feel like your character is improving as you gear up, this just makes sure you don't improve to the point where you're able to kill someone before they have an opportunity to respond. <br />

Conquest Vendors Temporarily Disabled<br />
We're still working on a fix for the Conquest cap so the Conquest vendors can be brought back. I'll keep /poking for info but don't have anything new to share. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/269299-conquest-vendors-temporarily-disabled/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9972358604?page=11#204))<br />
<br />
Raid Finder Difficulty<br />
There are likely tweaks and fixes to be made here and there, but first week of any new LFR wing is like this as people learn the mechanics, and there are always threads like this.<br />
<br />
I notice a number of people discussing about the difficulty of Norushen on Raid Finder. We're aware that the Look Within phase may currently be incorrectly selecting players; making the fight harder than it needs to be. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/269506-lfr-overtuned/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10014151372?page=6#106))<br />
<br />
Legendary Meta Gems<br />
If you're referring to the meta-gems awarded by Wrathion from The Crown of Heaven they will continue to work as those gems don't have a Sha-Touched or Armament of the Thunder King requirement.<br />
<br />
However, there was a change in 5.4 while using meta-gems outside of the intended specialization.<br />
<br />
<br />
Capacitive Primal Diamond (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95346-capacitive-primal-diamond), and Legendary melee cloaks (Fen-Yu, Fury of Xuen, and Gong-Lu, Strength of Xuen) now have a 40% reduced chance to activate its effects for characters that are in a tanking specialization.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which was a very lazy change. Tanks should have wanted to use the tanking items because they were better than the DPS options, not because they DPS options don't work normally for tank specs.<br />
Good thing we also did this then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Indomitable Primal Diamond (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95344-indomitable-primal-diamond)'s effect now grants a 20% damage reduction to all damage taken (up from only physical damage), and its activation rate has been doubled.<br />

Proving Ground's NPC Party AI<br />
We've actually been making several adjustments to the AI of the NPC party members in the healing Proving Grounds via hotfix.

How much data after a patch do you need before you see a balance issue or it a case by case basis?<br />
Case by case. For PvE, the first week has a lot of noise. Folks learning fights... overgeared heroic players gearing alts, etc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378606971877744641))<br />
<br />
is it frustrating how much emphasis people put on tiny stat/dps difference rather than play their class well/correctly?<br />
Very much so. If a spec swap nets you 2% dps and playing your chosen spec better nets you 20% dps, your priorities are off. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377201330403561473))<br />

There is no way you can buff destro SINGLE target damage without buffing CBolt, but CB is too burtsy in pvp. Solution<br />
We can make CB hit for less in PvP if necessary. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378560151038345216))<br />

Hey GC, can you explain why Warriors are not allowed to transmog their 2h weapons to polearms?<br />
The intention was that they could. We'll investigate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378555466772541440))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Legendary cloak contribution to overall dps: 6-8% from personal experience. Do you think that is too much ? People are asking<br />
Is this for a specific spec or across the board? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378554630474444800))<br />
Also consider players likely are playing sub-optimally on bosses they haven't really learned yet, inflating cloak influence. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378554890332557313))<br />
<br />
Folks, why do you - developers, keep making pve and pvp items with such a dramatic diff in ilvls? 522 vs 572(0\2) ?<br />
So that new / reroll PvP players can quickly get from quest greens to Honor items to Conquest items. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378557045537918976))<br />
<br />
are timeless isle items with a single stat being weaker intentional? kinda frustrating using a burden and getting one.<br />
Unlike normal loot, we cheated on the splitting rules for those TI items. They aren't weaker, assuming you like that stat. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378283326861082624))<br />
<br />
As I understand it, that's just how they work. More of a stat costs more. So 3x stats gets more total than 2x or 1x<br />
Typically items with more kinds of stats are more powerful, but not the case for the double stats on the TI randoms. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378555750341029889))<br />
<br />
Raid Finder<br />
It's just, for some of us, raiding - normal or Flex - is not viable. LFR is all we've got. It doesn't make us inferior.<br />
*Totally* agree. On the other hand, we want to make the rewards for harder difficulties commensurate with their effort. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377941055988961280))<br />
<br />
-esque whiners who complain they aren't special enough. Punishing LFR runners by delaying SoO's end by almost a month<br />
We have delayed the final wings of the previous incarnations of LFR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377913978472525824))<br />
It's like this: we can't force LFR groups to wipe for a week before getting a new boss. So we just delay the later bosses. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377914107006951425))<br />
The alternative would be you blaze through all 14 on the first week of LFR and each individual boss doesn't even get noticed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377914264620498944))<br />

<br />
An Age of Conan dev said ´ wow is like hamburger, AOC is steak´...<br />
<br />
I will list warhammers issues<br />
<br />
1. within 2 weeks, every server was faction imbalanced. The entire game was built around the two sides pushing against each other in the ´middle´ of the world. That never happened, not on any servers, and not even for the first month. Players rolled on dominate servers and steamrolled past what was supposed to be the meatiest areas. They expected city raids to not happen for months after launch, they were happening the first 3 weeks because players only created characters on servers that were dominate to that faction.<br />
<br />
2. PVP endgame was instanced pve. (mainly because they weren´t ready at launch and expected to have more time. Imagine a game built around pvp, but when you invaded the enemy capital, which was supposed to be the ultimate achievement.. it was nothing but an instanced city without enemy players. Enemy players could avoid that instance completely and never actually see the enemy destroying their npcs. <br />
<br />
Other than that, it was a fun an decent pve game. Classes were fun, races were fun.. questing was typical.. public quests were a neat idea and similar to what we see on timeless island ( think ale boss). But you can´t build your game around RvR and then let factions get so out of balance that there never is any viable pvp.<br />

That was not the correct Norushen fix to make, but whatever :|<br />

They did capture the Warhammer world really well but it had too many bugs, the classes felt underpowered and unresponsive to play and really unbalanced servers.<br />
It could have been a great game but it felt abandoned by its devs only half a year after launch, Mythic has become a shitty company after they sold it to EA.</div></div><hr />

Or maybe Aion West? Who knows. Aion at least does well enough in the East that the game truly won't go anywhere for at least another 5 years.</div></div><hr />

Witch elves don't hide, and they certainly don't pick locks (they break down the door to get to the sacrifices inside). White Lions aren't a pet class - they hunt lions for their pelts. Squig herders aren't eagle-eyed archers who commands their squigs to help them out a bit - they prod the squig until they can unleash it, and hope like hell that it doesn't eat them first.<br />

In the end all that didn't make me go away, what made me quit was that it didn't run well enough on the laptop I had at the time.</div></div><hr />

That and DDO, but Turbine has even kept Asheron's Call running and with continued development since 99. With recent expansions to LOTRO I do not think it will be gone soon</div></div><hr />

The delay between keypress and action was just too much for me to handle, basically making combat a snooze fest. Not to mention even after launch it was severely buggy. My friends who played WAR at end game for awhile said their main complaint was the repetition. Same sieges and same dull goals repeated over and over, that coupled with incredible faction imbalance ruined it for many of them.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if we would ever get a MMO that is as successful as WoW with interesting and consistent lore while match WoW in gameplay. Face it, WoW's lore is a bad joke and is one of the few things keeping it from being the perfect MMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The class designs are awesome i mean a melee healer is one of the best things i've played.. the Disciple of Khaine and Warrior Priests have almost been emulated i mean the WoW Monk is pretty close but melee healing just doesn't work all the time like it did with the 2 WAR classes<br />
<br />
The Magus class still has some of the sweetest armor concept and designs i've seen ever in an MMO it just oozes bad ass <br />

I am expecting a similiar message from Rift, Aoc and Lotro before the end of next year (lotro is already near death after most of what was left of their players flocked to gw2 and rift-f2p).</div></div><hr />

LOTRO is a long way from dying. It has a new expansion coming soon and is doing very well. It's a pretty good game and It's realms are still pretty active.</div></div><hr />

It's an inch away from dying man.... sorry to burst your hope.....<br />
This is even from before the recent servermerge, stats are even worse now (huge plummet of activity after gw2 release and rift going f2p).</div></div><hr />

This is even from before the recent servermerge, stats are even worse now (huge plummet of activity after gw2 release and rift going f2p).I never heard of any server merge so I don't where you're getting that from. When I log in there is still more activity than there was before they started F2P. There certainly wouldn't be a huge new expansion with sweeping class changes about to launch if there was a chance of the game dying. From the activity I saw, GW2 had little to no impact.<br />
<br />
That chart has to be bogus.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocd1f612b92e</div><div class="date">2013-09-20, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not bogus, it's from a program that measures online people, here is another with more recent data.<br />
<br />
http://wavehh.dyndns.org/lo/plot-cool-mean.jpg<br />
<br />
Notice the massive drop in activity towards the end of 2012 at the GW2 release. The &quot;expansion&quot; that is coming is another farce, 10 more levels of garbage grindquests and no other pve content at launch except for dailies, just like it was with RoR. And they dare to charge 30 euros for that crap, plus dare to charge another 30 euros for some cosmetic addons. <br />
The &quot;class balancing&quot; that they are doing is going to cause another drop in activity, read the lotro forums (people generally are not skeptical but now it is a big pile of furious players). <br />
Turbine is just milking the last money out of a sinking ship, they are doing so ever since the game went &quot;free to play&quot;, because face it, there is nothing free to play about lotro. When you are not premium that massive &quot;buy more in the cash shop&quot; popup is there, in your face, all the time at everything you do. <br />
Want to do more zones after lvl 20? Buy them in the cashshop, want to do an instance? buy it in the cashshop, want to do skirmish? guess what, shell out more money! <br />
They are even doing this to people that have been subscribed and paying for years. E.g. someone that has been playing lotro from the start and paid 4 years of sub before the game went F2P has to pay the same money to even unlock questing as a guy who just downloaded the game for free and never paid a penny before. That is what is killing lotro. The only people left there are either the few with a lifetime sub or the ones who are bored enough to grind for 50 hours to unlock one questzone for &quot;free&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dch48</div><div class="date">2013-09-20, 08:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well since I have always considered new leveling and questing content to be the best part of any game and never do the group content or raids in LOTRO, the expansion sounds good to me. I've been playing it off and on since 2008 and still am only at level 71 with my Hunter. I'm actually just starting the Isengard stuff and won't get to Rohan for a while so I'll wait to buy HD until it goes on sale like I've done with all the others. All the expansions have been good, especially MoM which was awesome. I enjoy seeing the story unfold like in the movies and books and that's why I play. I also get all the new festival mounts. LOTRO does the seasonal festivals much better than WoW does.<br />
<br />
LOTRO is a fine game and the complainers on their forums don't rate any higher with me than the ones in WOW.<br />
<br />
If you are a subscriber, and I am, you don't have to pay extra or grind anything to unlock anything except for expansions. And, I looked it up even though I knew I was right. There have been NO server merges in LOTRO.<br />
<br />
Like the WOW whiners, you say LOTRO is dying because you obviously want it to. It is alive and well whether you like it or not.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocd1f612b92e</div><div class="date">2013-09-20, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Explains a lot that you haven't been in RoI yet.......<br />
MoM was a good expansion, this is when the game was still good.<br />
Go and play the RoI content and you will soon find out why players are flocking from lotro en masse, it is just 10 levels of &quot;kill 20 orcs&quot; quests, and when you killed the 20 orcs, you get a quest to kill 20 wolves, and then another quest to kill 20 more of the orcs you killed before, then you get a quest to kill the orc leader in the middle of those orcs, but ofcourse they all respawned so you have to kill all those orcs again (Think of Mirkwood but then even worse).<br />
That is the whole RoI expansion, at it's launch there where NO new dungeons at all, they just upped the Mirkwood dungeons to the new level cap... It took like 4-5 months before any new pve content came along.<br />
<br />
If you are subscriber you do not pay additional cost for content, which is frankly exactly what i said &gt;&gt; there is nothing F2P about lotro, they mightve just as well called the &quot;f2p&quot;part a trial.</div></div><hr />
