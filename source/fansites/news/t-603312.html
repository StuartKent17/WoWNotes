<br />
And now the bad news, it seems that the [item=33483] has been removed from G'eras on a lot of servers (and probably all of them now), you can only get it during a successful Zul'Aman timed run now. If you happen to be on a server where it's not removed yet I suggest that you buy it as soon as possible if you don't want to have to drop it.<br />

Scamming is bad<br />
A few days ago, the scam policy has been updated to include tons of changes about scammers. In short, if you scam someone you can get banned even if it's the first time, and if you get scammed you might get your items back by asking nicely.<br />
World of Warcraft is intended to be a fun and safe environment for our players to enjoy themselves, and being scammed can potentially negate hours of hard work that has gone into a character. Scamming is viewed as an anti-social action, and is not something which is within the spirit of the game - while item and gold security does ultimately fall down to the responsibility of the player, we wish to make it clear that attempts to purposefully spoil other’s fun in this way will not go unpunished.<br />
<br />
As a direct result of player feedback, we are introducing some changes to our scam policy. These changes will take effect with the introduction of patch 2.3, and you can find them at:<br />
<br />
http://www.wow-europe.com/en/policy/scam.html (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/policy/scam.html)<br />
<br />
Below is a brief summary of the main changes to the policy:<br />
<br />
Harsher punishment of scammers<br />
Previously we have only sought to take action against players who were persistently scamming others. With the changes in our scam policy, players who choose to scam others out of items and gold can face action against their account, even for a first offense! As with any other policy violation, repeated offenses of the same nature will lead to harsher consequences for the offending account.<br />
<br />
Investigations into item and gold loss<br />
While previously we did not investigate or reimburse any item or gold loss incurred as a result of an in-game scam, we will now investigate fully all losses, and if we are able to verify your particular case, we will try to assist with the return of any lost items or gold. Please note that due to the large amount of variables involved in verifying in-game scams, reimbursement of items and gold is not guaranteed. Please be aware that while we will try to assist players whenever possible, each case is viewed on an individual basis - if it is deemed that a player is being overly careless with the security of their items and gold, then we may review our decision to assist with such cases for that player’s account.<br />

First thing that made me scratch my head was this &quot;into PVE from PVP&quot; thing... because thats not possible!<br />
<br />
Even if it would it's not a Scam, because you were not tricket into somthing, you were &quot;just&quot; hacked.</div></div><hr />

I'm insulted you called it a moonkin weapon!<br />
<br />
*sob*<br />
<br />
On a different note, good to see they changed their scamming policies.<br />
I have never been scammed before because i carefully pick out crafters, but i can imagine how horrible it must feel if you just lost 3 weeks worth of horrible grinding in one click.</div></div><hr />

I read the same thing. And nope, don't have that either.</div></div><hr />

Spell damage, mp5 and huge stam on a pretty fast weapon. Also note the increased dammage. 66.6 as opposed to the typical 41dps weapons that healers and most caster weapons have....<br />

screams prot paladin at me and not really boomkin, but what do i know?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a prot pally weapon. Period. And, frankly, not an awful one---lots of stam.<br />
<br />
The only thing a moonkin would ever use that for is PvP.</div></div><hr />

Its BoE, meaning everyone can buy it. The &quot;this item is for X class only&quot; discussion is pretty stupid even for BoP item, its beyond retarded when it comes to craftable Bind on Equip items.<br />
<br />
Anyway, to post something on the actual weapon rather then flaming others, imho much of the ilvl have been wasted on mp5 and abit too much stats, that could have been traded in for more spelldamage. But that is a matter of taste i guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Erm, so you think that the new expansion is all about NPCs? There are a major number of instances, quests, mobs etc. to come, and you think if they added SOME NPCs - the expansion is ready? ;)</div></div><hr />
