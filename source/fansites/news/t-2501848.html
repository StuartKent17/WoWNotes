EU gets RP-PVP servers too. It's just that MMO-Champion didn't report it cause who cares about EU right.<br />

RP-PVP was always a mistake, those servers were dead even in Vanilla. Did 2 people scream loud enough to get more dead servers created?<br />
<br />
Pretty much this. Literally no one talked about RP-PvP servers, on EU the biggest RP server is Argent Dawn which was a PvE server. All of a sudden, all 3 of them that played on a RP-PvP came out like cockroachs saying their server (which is literally the smallest niche type server ever made) was bigger than RP-PvE lmao and as always, blizzard caters to the loudest population</div></div><hr />

I played on rp-pvp and was hoping for the server type to exist again. Rp servers have name rules and I like to pvp. This combines the best of both for me. The rppvp server I played on was medium pop and had a stable population for a very long time. I know at least two of them did.<br />
<br />
Just because it doesnt appeal to you doesn't mean we should not have them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cause it was on the US forums, exact same post is on EU forums too. I have hard time believing that someone actually thought there would only be one in one region. Feels like finding reasons for outrage is going above common sense.</div></div><hr />

ICC Timewalking probably won't happen at all, since we have one raid per expansion: Black Temple, Ulduar and now Firelands (I guess next one will be Throne of Thunder and then Blackrock Foundry). Lich King will be one of the bosses in anniversary raid.</div></div><hr />

It's to do with the Lich King fight in the anniversary event. ICC Timewalking likely won't be a thing for a long time.</div></div><hr />

Correct. On live when you take lethal damage you are returned to 30% hp with meta.<br />
<br />
When they remove the returns you to 30% part, that's called a Nerf....</div></div><hr />
