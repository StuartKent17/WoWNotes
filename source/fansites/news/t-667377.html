Onyxia 3.2.2 Updated Loot List<br />
The loot table of the new Onyxia encounter has been slightly updated, a few more items have been added to the 10-Man loot tables (like the Rusted Gutgore Ripper (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49437/rusted-gutgore-ripper/) and it seems that some of the weapon models have been updated to look slightly nicer than their old version.<br />
<br />
Obviously all the items aren't here but we didn't see a lot of 25-Man raids on test servers.<br />

Pandaren Monk is Bound to Account<br />
The Pandaren Monk (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49665/pandaren-monk/) has been datamined on test realms and apparently, this pet will be bound to your account. It doesn't really tell us where you will able to get it but it's still good to know that all your characters will have it if you can get one. <br />

New loot added to the Black Knight in 3.2.2<br />
Apparently a few items have been added to the Black Knight's loot table in 3.2.2, the Black Knight's Rondel (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49682/black-knights-rondel/) was discovered a few days ago on PTRs but there might be more. (The Black Knight isn't really the most tested encounter on test realms)<br />

Armor Penetration Nerf in 3.2.2<br />
There is rarely an ideal time to announce a nerf. In the case of e.g. the Prot paladin healing nerf, we had already decided we were going to fix it and how we were going to fix it so we announced it relatively early. The armor pen decision included more debate. I am sorry if the timing was bad for any of you personally, but we certainly can't promise that future nerfs or buffs won't necessitate gear changes.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't focus too much on the issue of using too many of the same kind of gem. There are plenty of situations where that has been the case since BC (though it's not ideal in a perfect world). Rather the case was that classes that had been using Agi or Str or whatever were now switching almost exclusively to armor pen and being greatly rewarded for it. Gear without armor pen was being passed over. Specs that benefited a lot from armor pen were outstripping specs in the same class. As many other players have concluded, it was just too good.<br />
<br />
That said, we don't think it will be a trash stat if we make this change. If you could beat plate-wearers in PvP before we don't think that will suddenly flip overnight. We don't think you'll feel the need to shard your items with armor pen.<br />
<br />
We also think the change is good for both PvE and PvP. My earlier comment was to try and discourage players from thinking their PvE got nerfed for PvP reasons, though that absolutely happens sometimes when we can't avoid it. Some players have been concerned about the power of melee classes in Arenas. While this change alone isn't likely to sway their opinions, chilling out melee damage in PvP probably isn't a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Yes, armor pen is gone in Cataclysm, at least as a rating on gear. Until then we want it to be a good stat but not one that trumps every other gear consideration. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19717353372-armor-pen-nerf-in-322.html))<br />
<br />
Best stat for me<br />
We're not trying to prevent having a &quot;best stat for me.&quot; To some extent, that's unavoidable. But if the best stat isn't far above the second best stat, then gearing is a decision beyond just &quot;take the thing with the best stat.&quot; While there may still be a best in slot item, those are rarely trivial to obtain and in the meantime you might have to actually consider the drops you do get.<br />
<br />
Some of you are saying you'll never touch armor pen again, which I find questionable, but we'll see. Some of you are saying you'll stack it even more to get as close to the cap as you can. But there is a point at which you are giving up too many other stats just to benefit from armor pen. Not many people really wanted it when it was at the original LK value (we'll call that 100%) so there has to be a sweet spot between that and the 3.2 value of 125%.<br />
<br />
One valid point many players have mentioned is that stats that cap, say hit, just keep getting a more and more generous allotment of rating on higher gear even though players don't necessarily need more as they face tougher foes. That is a design flaw with the system, though not necessarily an easy one to fix with these kinds of number tweaks.

Reasons behind the nerf of Downranking<br />
We were spending more and more of our design time trying to make sure that the lower ranked spells didn't always trump the higher ranked spells since with enough spell power etc. the coefficients start to matter a lot more than the flat value of the heals. We kept nerfing the coefficients over and over and could have kept doing that, but at some point we asked ourselves why so much of our healing design time was spent balancing downranking when it was a pretty obscure concept (from a new player perspective) in the first place and we were having trouble getting healers to use their entire arsenal of spells.<br />
<br />
We recognize that there is some fun in matching the right heal to the job, and we would love to add some smaller heals back to the game, but first we have to get the balance right where huge, fast, expensive heals don't always win. Otherwise, offering you small, cheap heals won't do anything. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/19717544438-why-did-blizz-do-away-with-downranking-heals.html))<br />
<br />
Balancing Tanks<br />
Tank balance was a non-issue in classic and BC (that's 4 or so years of your 5 years) because warriors were designed to be the best tank. In other words, we made no attempt to balance the tank classes, so beating us up for not accomplishing what we weren't trying to do seems odd to me.<br />
<br />
In most cases warriors were the best tank. They were certainly far and away the most common. When there were situations that other classes started to outstrip warriors, we took steps to make sure the warriors still came out on top.<br />
<br />
We changed that philosophy in LK (and added another tank). Now all 4 tanking classes can tank any encounter in the game. It is closer than it has ever been in the history of WoW and is close enough that you have to be on a very cutting-edge encounter at the absolute limits of your capabilities for it to really even be a factor. Many of the world first kills and most of the cutting-edge guilds still use a warrior MT and obviously they're still cutting edge. For 90% of us, usually upping your game (learning the strategy, changing what you do, or just improving your skill) or getting better gear will have a bigger impact than switching tanks. In those cases where that has stopped being the case (and that has happened) we took steps to correct it.<br />
<br />
It's pretty close. Could it be closer? Absolutely. But make sure when you are making your &quot;tanks are horribly impabalanced&quot; posts that you have experienced those encounters first hand and aren't just replying with what you've read on the forums about how your class needs buffs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19717563988-bosses-wont-hit-for-40k-cont.html))<br />
<br />
Balancing the game<br />
There are two basic strategies for balancing the game. One is that we just let things go until major content patches (or even expansions). The other is we step in and make adjustments when we feel it's appropriate. We tried the first way for a long time, but it was fairly frustrating for classes who were behind or had other issues knowing that they would be that way for months or longer. We've been trying the other way more lately -- making pretty rapid adjustments, though not always as rapid as some players would like. However there is a consequence that sometimes you'll get nerfed even as other classes get buffed, or you'll have to rethink your gear when some stat becomes better than something else. It's a two-way street. Now, we don't want it to feel like a roller coaster or feel arbitrary in any way. But we also don't want broken things to just endure, and everyone here would agree there is more we can fix. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19717353372-armor-pen-nerf-in-322.html))<br />

It will most propably be the Cata CE Pet. The only BoA pets are the CE pets and those from WWI and BlizzCon '05 and not to forget the Baby Blizzard Bear. All Pets mentioned are Rare exept the Bear. So, or there will be an unannounced Blizzard Event in the near Future or this will mostly be the new CE Pet</div></div><hr />

Why does it? I don't think we should go back to Vanilla's &quot;You're class X, so you do role Y&quot;, but I'm not a huge fan of things like how DKs can tank in every spec, but also DPS in those specs. As much as Blizzard can deny it, Druids and Paladins are incredibly powerful for hybrids. They're tanks who can do high DPS, druids are good raid healers with paladins being good tank healers, their DPS specs also tend to be good (retri got nerfed, but feral kitty is still pretty damn good). That is what needs changing, IMHO.</div></div><hr />

In regards to the tank balancing of the blue post, I don't think it is blizzard. Many people complain about tank balance and it isn't the design here that does it. People still have &quot;this tank does this&quot; and &quot;that tank is better than this at X and Y.&quot; Many of these notions are just rediculous and outdated. It isn't blizzard's tank design, it is the cult and how they view these false differences. <br />
<br />
One example I am talking about. Who has ever done a VoA and without even any ther consideration its &quot;Pally on the adds.&quot; Like this has gotten so rediculous where I was placed on adds with 11k more hp than the DK that was there. That is BC style. A druid in my guild is amazing at AOE tanking, all classes can do it now. Even my guild with raids defaults a Paladin to adds even though a Pally can MT anything. <br />
<br />
I dont think it is blizzard's design in tanking. I think they have done a very good job in balancing the 4 tanks . It is the old school false cult perceptions that makes them pick one or the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To have Str / AP / SP / Agility ... as the &quot;one super stat&quot; is not a problem, because you will always find gear with more of it. And everybody care a lot about those stats, when ArP, hit (above specials cap) crit or haste help more or less some specs.<br />
<br />
But after buffing Armor Pen, they found that some people now give up on their standard stat, and just try to max it. Meaning that if they added more powerfull gear in IC without ArP (because as we said, some people could care less about this stat) , i'm pretty sure you would have found some guys proving that without 4pT10 or whatever, you shoudn't even care about the instance drops, or even worse, BiS T9 &gt; BiS T10.<br />
<br />
So now they remove half the buff they did before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It could be a &quot;change&quot;, for once. You know, you earn the pet on one character for doing so much (Let's say all the quests and any dailies 3 times over the course of the holiday), and once you've got it, you can send it to your other characters. Just an idea, could be (and wouldn't be surprised if I was) wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Then 3.2.2 would need to hit before Brewfest, so either today or next week, but I doubt that. At least it's not this week, gives me some more time to level my warrior to 60 for (the old) Quel'Serrar, 4 levels to go :P (and getting a hold of the starting book :()<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One example I am talking about. Who has ever done a VoA and without even any ther consideration its &quot;Pally on the adds.&quot; Like this has gotten so rediculous where I was placed on adds with 11k more hp than the DK that was there.<br />
<br />
Actually, it more depends on personal skill, the better tank is put on the adds, Emalon himself doesn't really need a that well-geared tank, let alone one with &quot;skill&quot;. I once accidentally pulled him with Cat gear spec not that very long after 3.1 hit, and while I got rather low sometimes, it wasn't that much of an issue.</div></div><hr />

There's always going to be at least a few dooshbags out there that want to stay Overpowered, and other people out there that will always thing the game is perfect the way it is. Another example, someone replying to this might be the kind that likes to argue against EVERYTHING that gets said in every forum without an opinion, those are the people making this game worse.<br />
<br />
I disagree however, on holding back on the lore. Bring out new stuff! Stop bringing back OLD content, I know it's what the people wanted, but those were just crying noobs trying to get their Alt characters geared. So many level 58 Death knight's farming poor Onyxia, too many whining noobs about bringing Deadmines back, they need new content.</div></div><hr />

Actually, getting a world first on that is just like getting the world first on one of the ugly Vault triplet.</div></div><hr />

One of the articles in the 1st issue will be on noncombat pets (as was stated in a flyer given at Blizzcon), the mag will not be on sale in stores, and it just sounds like something Blizz would do to boost magazine sales.........Any guesses as to how much the monk will go for on Ebay if this is true :)</div></div><hr />
