<br />
Note that we’re planning another round of balance updates for the near future after this round, which will include changes for other specs (including Warlock and Death Knight).<br />
<br />
<br />
Prot warriors in 8.1<br />
Shamans got a blue; Here's to hoping Warriors get one.<br />
<br />
I won't make a massive OP, there's been tomes written on how broken prot was since earliest stages of BfA beta. It's common knowledge that warriors make up for under 5% of all tank representation after 2 weeks of Uldir, in ALL types of content;<br />
<br />
They're weak, they lack a niche, their kit has been massively hurt by the GCD change, and they need a lot of love to become viable. Like. Without exaggeration, it's easier to heal a shadow priest who pulls aggro in a dungeon, than a prot warrior in that same dungeon...<br />
<br />
Blizzard? Are you doing this one class at a time, or can prots hope for some love as well? Cause it honestly feels really bad when the most iconic tank in the game is just so far behind it's not even worth using any more...<br />
I can’t speak to any plans for the patch, but I do know that we’re planning to make some tuning adjustments sometime in the next few weeks which should include some defensive buffs for Protection Warriors. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1101836-prot-warriors-in-81/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769068522?page=1#18))<br />
<br />
Just curious but why can't you speak to any plans for the patch? You explained the tooltips for the proposed ele shaman changes, but can't speak about warriors? Or is it that there is nothing changing in the patch for warriors?<br />
Few reasons. Partially because I'm not a class designer, so I don't make those decisions. But also because the class team themselves haven't decided yet. We agree Prot Warriors need love, but aren't 100% decided on exactly what form those changes will take, which also means we don't know if it'll need to be in a patch or not. The Elemental changes require a patch, otherwise we'd just hotfix them in.<br />
<br />
Regarding this upcoming tuning pass, I wouldn't expect it to be something that solves every Prot Warrior grievance, but it should hopefully help while we look into potential further adjustments.<br />
<br />
Hate to say it (and hate to nail it to you Lore) but class imbalance is very very bad right now. I think most of us don't want classes that are OP or overtuned-- but we would like to see them fluid enough and competitive enough that we can feel comfortable that our individual investment will ensure us a spot and a chance at current WoW content.<br />
Class balance is definitely a sore spot right now, both in community feedback and our own internal discussions. We're working on it. It's a delicate thing; we want to solve the issue of players feeling like their class is undesired, but we also want to avoid the opposite issue where everyone feels like they need to reroll to whatever the new hotness is every few weeks (side note, that's part of why we do tuning adjustments in batches rather than every few days, to give things a little time to stabilize before the next round).<br />
<br />
I'd also like to submit the argument that, while class balance certainly isn't perfect right now, it's also the beginning of an expansion, which is *always* a bit shaky for class balance. There are absolutely outliers on either side of the spectrum, with some buffs and most likely some nerfs incoming, but aside from those few cases, our data (based on hundreds of thousands of boss kills, arena matches, etc) is showing that class balance isn't that far out of whack from how things were at the start of Legion, or Warlords, or Mists, etc.<br />
<br />
But like I said, we're working on it, and will have more to share soon. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1101836-prot-warriors-in-81/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769068522?page=2#24))<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Vicious Saddles in Battle for Azeroth<br />
Hey guys! This is something we've seen y'all ask about and just wanted to share some insight to the Vicious Saddle mounts.<br />
<br />
Currently, players can earn Vicious Saddles through the “Veteran of the Alliance” or “Veteran of the Horde” series of per-character achievements. We’re also working on some new ways players can earn Vicious Saddles in the next major content update, Tides of Vengeance.<br />
<br />
Note that the Battle for Azeroth seasonal mounts will not be added to the saddle vendor until sometime after the conclusion of the final Battle for Azeroth PvP season. Until then, the only way to earn these mounts will be to actively participate in the associated PvP season.<br />

PvP Brawl: Shado-Pan Showdown No Credit<br />
We're pushing a hotfix out shortly with the quest not correctly giving credit with Shado-pan Showdown. We're also increasing the reward, and resetting the quest so those who already completed it can complete it again.<br />
<br />
You should see that reflected in game soon™ (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1101834-pvp-brawl-shado-pan-showdown-no-credit/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769108612?page=3#50))</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
(PVP) Nerf disc priests, rogues, warriors &amp; retry paladins. Mages also need a slight nerf I think.<br />
<br />
Cyclone must be baseline again for Balance druids and feral affinity should be something useful to go for. Force of Nature should last like 15-20 seconds, not just 10.<br />
<br />
Thunderstorm CD for Elemental shamans must be 20 or 30 seconds baseline. They have no mobility at all damn it, at least they must be able to push away melees more often.<br />
<br />
Demonology dreadstalkers should be baseline instacast for all modes and not a PVP talent (it's suposed to be a master summoner and it's a summoning turret and there are other PVP talents to go for). And buff imps damage, they hit like crap. Actually all the whole spec damage is a joke.<br />
<br />
Warlock pets should be named as the way we want to, and there's an awful bug with this to be fixed: when Gliphed, you can not change the name of the pets.<br />
<br />
(PVP) Healers are still unkillable, nerf their healing for all of them.<br />
<br />
Bring back the option to go for a zoo build for BM hunters, if you are beast master the spec is supposed to be about pets as its name mentions. AND FIX THE ANIMAL COMPANION TALENT, it's bugged as hell.<br />
<br />
Pets (warlock, hunter) should jump down from an edge when their owner does, not going aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall the way around, which is stupid and a huge loss of time/dps. Besides this they die way too fast now, even the Felguard or the Voidwalker. <br />
There are still some things of the game that can be abused on PVP and must be nerfed with a CD, like the Demon Hunters gliding thing or lots of rogues stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would rather buff other classes. These aren't the only two strong classes. I've been playing priest, dk, rogue, and lock the expansion, and lock feels strongest followed by rogue and then priest. The prob with nerfing disc priest is that their only other DPS spec blows. If they nerf them too hard then they cannot even solo. Imagine if they dropped warlock dot damage or rogue bleeds to half the damage, or reduced rogue stuns to half their duration. These classes would have a significantly worse time leveling. Balancing isn't just nerf x class (not my class) because they perform well right now. Rather than making classes feel worse, I'd rather buff classes like dk and shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Granted not all changes make sense, but most do. Assas rogues and DH are doing a bit too much damage right now imo, and will be tough to compete with after these changes. Locks, spriests, dk and ww are pretty awful, but these nerfs to other classes could bring them a bit closer to balanced in addition to the future buffs they mentioned (well lock and dk for sure).</div></div><hr />

Tbh I dont think that will work from any caster point of view, even for Mages. The silence, cc and interrupts making Melee superior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is the reallity: When you choose your talents you look up a picture where they show what you HAVE TO pick to not be a weight on the other people in your group. With these azerite traits you have to look another picture what tells what you HAVE TO pick for the same reason. There is no fun in that.<br />
<br />
What is the point of these new systems? The illusion of choice?</div></div><hr />

Demon hunter share the same &quot;lore connection&quot; to demons than Warlock, so why not, it wouldn't be crazy to see that happening.</div></div><hr />

Blizz: &quot;There is literally only 1 DK that's 2400+ (https://www.arenamate.net/?region=&amp;realm=&amp;rating=2400&amp;ladder=3v3&amp;faction=&amp;class_filter=6), better nerf UDK more!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this a fking joke????<br />
<br />
My thoughts exactly....</div></div><hr />

Always played SP but BFA forced me to play Disc because it was so extremly OP that feels like it will be nerfed soon.<br />
Now you nerf all the other classes and still im here killing ppl from a healer specc.<br />
Rogue ALT here.<br />
Always one-shotted everyone without any kind of skill since Vanilla.<br />
Not a single nerf at all in 14years. <br />
Now two things come to my mind: 1st you all play rog/disc at Blizz and want to own the game. 2nd you dont have a clue whats going on in your game.<br />
<br />
Hope someone gonna lose their job following this obvious incompetence.</div></div><hr />

He was pretty darn overtuned on high tyrannical actually. That DoT was just so punishing, especially with a shaman healer. We literally walked away from him on a 9 tyrannical last week but we had no problem with bosses other people complain about like the Golden Serpent in KR. But Overseer was just constant dots/circles on the same people all the time, knockbacks, constant force to move, etc. We were even using the corner method.</div></div><hr />

Guess I never noticed it since I always roll with a Hunter/Mage/Rogue which all have ways of dealing with it. That bomb boss lady was harder than he was and she was also pretty easy.</div></div><hr />

The shaman class is a mess atm but the offhealing shamans do is insane! And most of it are instant casts.</div></div><hr />

But also because the class team themselves haven't decided yet. We agree Prot Warriors need love, but aren't 100% decided on exactly what form those changes will take, which also means we don't know if it'll need to be in a patch or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So I kinda want to make sure I understand this situation here. <br />
<br />
The issues with prot have been discussed, ad nauseum, since the beta. Nearly everyone who beta tested prot told you that the spec was in &quot;need of love&quot;. But outside of the GCD changes, the problems themselves have actually existed since Ignore Pain was first nerfed in the second week of Legion and I know it's been mentioned since then (partly because I've been doing some of the mentioning.)<br />
<br />
We are now right about (give or take a few days) TWO YEARS since that date and the devs are just now sitting down to talk about what to do? Really? REALLY?</div></div><hr />
