Patch 7.2 - Mobs Scaling With Item Level<br />
Apologies for the delay in getting information out on this - our initial focus was on putting out other patch-day fires.<br />
<br />
Yes, this reflects a deliberate change, but it's also not working exactly as we intended. The scaling may be too steep, and the fact that unequipping a piece of gear can ever be helpful is a bug in the system. We'll be looking into making changes to correct this in the very near future.<br />
<br />
Power progression is an essential part of the WoW endgame, and the last thing we want is to undermine that. We stressed the importance of that progression when discussing how the level-scaling system worked in Legion around the time of the expansion's launch, and explained why we then had no plans to scale foes' power based on gear. But as we've watched Legion unfold, we've come to observe some side-effects of our endgame content plan and the associated rewards structure that made us reconsider.<br />
<br />
We've never had the initial outdoor world content stay relevant for this long in an expansion before. By the end of Mists of Pandaria, for example, the mantid of Dread Wastes that had once been reasonable foes were completely trivial. They'd basically evaporate if a raid-geared player looked in their general direction. But there wasn't much reason besides achievements or completionism to revisit the Klaxxi dailies once Isle of Thunder was out or, later on, Timeless Isle. And the enemies in those later zones could be tuned to a proportionally more challenging baseline difficulty.<br />
<br />
But in Legion, while the new content in Broken Shore is the focus of 7.2, and we've made sure that the core outdoor rewards (both dropped and from Nethershards) are superior to the rep-related rewards from the original factions, the intent is not for the Broken Shore to completely replace the rest of the game. You'll still go back to the other Broken Isles zones for emissaries, Legion Assaults (coming next week!), Order campaign quests, improved world quest rewards, and more. And as 7.1 and 7.1.5 progressed, we could see that even with Nighthold gear the pacing of combat was getting a bit silly - what would happen once new content made that level of gear more common, and once the Tomb raid pushed limits even higher?<br />
<br />
To reiterate, power progression is an essential part of the WoW endgame. We absolutely want you to feel overpowered as you return to steamroll content that once was challenging. But there's a threshold beyond which the game's core mechanics start to break down. When someone trying to wind up a 2.5sec cast can't get a nuke off against a quest target before another player charges in and one-shots it, that feels broken. And even for the Mythic-geared bringer of death and destruction, when everything dies nearly instantly, you spend more time looting corpses than you do making them. You spend an order of magnitude longer traveling to a quest location than you do killing the quest target. You stop using your core class abilities and instead focus on spamming instants to tap mobs as quickly as possible before they die.<br />
<br />
Our goal is basically to safeguard against that degenerate extreme. We tune outdoor combat for a fresh 110 around a 12-15sec duration against a standard non-elite, non-boss enemy. It's great for gear, over the course of an expansion to cut that time in half, or even by two-thirds. But once you get down to a duration of one or two global cooldowns, the game just wasn't built to support that as the norm. (Note that this is an current-content endgame concern; running legacy content for completion/transmog/etc. purposes is a totally different story.)<br />
<br />
The intent of our change in 7.2 was to smooth out that progression curve a bit, not flatten it out, and certainly never to invert it. If you get a great set of item upgrades that make you 5% stronger, maybe the world gets 1-2% tougher. Perhaps instead of getting 400% stronger over the course of the expansion relative to the outdoor world, you only get 250% stronger. But you should always be getting more powerful in relative terms, and upgrades should always matter. From some reactions so far, it sounds like we may be off on that tuning. And as noted above, the fact that unequipping items can ever be helpful is a bug that we'll be investigating and fixing.<br />
<br />
Finally, there's the natural question of why we didn't patch-note this. It was not to be deceptive; we know it's impossible to hide a change from millions of players. But the system was meant to feel largely transparent and subtle, just like level-scaling does if you don't stop and really think about it, and so we did want players to first experience the change organically. Your feedback and reactions and first impressions of the system are more useful in this particular case when they are not skewed by the experience of logging in and actively trying to spot the differences. Thank you for that, and I look forward to continued discussion.<br />
<br />
So now we have to consult ilvl spreadsheets to figure out which pieces of gear we need to unequip to make our daily chores as painless as possible. Fun.<br />
To be clear, it's unacceptable to us for the &quot;right&quot; thing in any form to ever be equipping weaker gear, unequipping items, or doing things that in any way lower your &quot;absolute&quot; power. There are a couple of loopholes where that is true currently, and they'll be high-priority fixes for us in the next day or two.<br />
<br />
Also to be clear, scrapping the entire system is certainly still an option. My post was not meant to be a &quot;too bad, get used to it&quot; proclamation.<br />
<br />
But I did want to lay out what we consider to be the very real problem we're trying to solve here. I also understand that to many folks it doesn't appear to be a real problem at all, and it seems like we're just trying to throw up pointless obstacles.<br />
<br />
Power always feels good. It feels better to kill something in 5 seconds than in 10, especially when you remember when it took 10. Even better when you can do it in 2. Better still when you can kill 4 or 5 things in that time. But is there a point where that goes too far? We think so, and we're just looking to ease up off the gas pedal a little bit. We don't want to halt the power curve, and certainly never to go in reverse, but rather to take a bit longer on our road to an endgame world where everyone effectively walks around death-touching mobs for quest credit.<br />

Legion PvP Season 3 Has Begun<br />
A new season has begun, and the Arenas and Battlegrounds await new contenders. Who will rise to the top?<br />
<br />
With Legion Season 3, the maximum number of times you can earn Prestige has increased from 9 to 13.<br />
<br />
Season 2 Rewards Reminder<br />
If you participated in Season 2, to ensure you receive the rewards that you’re due, please keep the following in mind:<br />
<br />
<br />
Refrain from transferring your character(s) to another realm or faction until after Legion Season 2 rewards have been distributed.<br />
Legion Season 2 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Faction-Based Rewards<br />
Don’t forget: end-of-season rewards are based on your faction. The top 0.5% of Alliance PvPers will be awarded the Gladiator: Legion Season 2 achievement and mount, and the same will go to the top 0.5% of Horde PvPers. If you transferred your character to the other faction, you must have earned 50 wins after the transfer to receive the reward.<br />
<br />
The Arenas and Battlegrounds await!<br />

Random Heroic Dungeon and Karazhan<br />
From my understanding, for Heroic, this is a bug that we are in the process of hotfixing - Return to Karazhan (Heroic) should not have an attunement attached to it.<br />

Return to Karazhan (Mythic) will continue to have an attunement attached to it and players will need to complete &quot;Power of Corruption&quot; before entering.

Holy Priest - Prayer of Healing<br />
Prayer of Healing has been a bit of a puzzle to decide the right approach for in recent expansions. We always appreciate feedback on where it currently is, but for a few thoughts on it:<br />
<br />
We definitively wanted to get rid of the version based on raid subgroups in Legion. At this point, it was the only spell left in the game that relied on that, and required raid leaders to rearrange groups at the behest of one player to make one of their spells work correctly. Furthermore, with an increasing amount of raiding being done in the &quot;flexible&quot; framework, raid sizes are not even reliably a multiple of 5 anymore.<br />
<br />
We also want to be careful with heals that are too smart. A PoH with a large radius, smart targeting, and no cooldown would essentially be a self-working raid healing spell/rotation. As long as 5 people are damaged (which is frequently), you can spam that spell to the get best efficiency from your mana, not overheal, and not have to worry about targeting. That's a direction we don't like for healing gameplay in general and have been paring back on in recent years.<br />
<br />
One other thing that felt bad about the 7.0 version (20 yard radius) was that it didn't hit the whole party in 5-player content. That's a role that Prayer of Healing has always had and that it should keep having.

Reap Souls<br />
FYI, the Reap Souls change should be in place on the PTR already.<br />
<br />
We do agree that always starting at 0 would not have been a great place to end up, and wanted to put something in at the same time to help address the concerns that have been mentioned. The total result should be that you feel like you can have a more reliable opener with at least 3 Souls.

I've obviously done this many times, but this time felt inherently different.<br />
<br />
I gave this as the answer to the question/questionnaire Blizzard gives you about why you are canceling your subscription: overwhelmed by monotony.<br />
<br />
I couldn't be more happy that Blizzard fixed the biggest problem with WoD: lack of content. Unfortunately the content they are putting out/have put out I find to be fundamentally poorly designed, and not well thought through. Maybe the next expansion will see them fix that problem too. I truly hope so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Q: Do World Quests scale with item level, or will they just become trivially easier for greater rewards?<br />
<br />
A: Once you're max level, the world isn't scaling with your gear. There would be problems if we tried to do that - what do you do with a fresh 110 and a raid-geared 110 fighting the same mob in the same place? We could some kind of scaling I guess, like leveling, to normalize it? But I think that would go too far in undermining the core sense of power progression that is part of an MMO. The stuff that was challenging for you in Suramar, that was challenging when you first hit 110 in greens...when you come back in Mythic dungeon gear, you should crush them a bit. The intent is that the content is is something you outgear, outpower eventually.<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2: Active subcribers have noticed that mobs appear to be scaling up based on player item level.<br />
<br />
I hope the re*ard who choosed that idea will lose his job. People can handle losing everything after 2 years by the new exp. But losing power after every patch. This is next level. There is no point to grind if you cannot feel the progress. This is another pure example the developers don't play their own game. what a shame... Total disconnection with their player base.<br />

this change is indeed beynd retarded - and what make it even worse they knew how it will play out that why they kept it in complete secret till launch of patch<br />

Yes, this reflects a deliberate change, but it's also not working exactly as we intended. The scaling may be too steep, and the fact that unequipping a piece of gear can ever be helpful is a bug in the system. We'll be looking into making changes to correct this in the very near future.<br />

Get a DPS artifact. You are welcome. You should know damn well as a healer to have a DPS artifact ready for things like this to avoid this. You can literally get half the traits for one in an hour. Maybe less.</div></div><hr />

They said they wanted to make healer- and tankspec viable options in the open world because of how the artifact system works. Questing as a healer has worked perfectly fine, but currently if you sit at 910+ ilvl it gets extra painful for healers compared to dps. <br />

Mines only a tad higher. Your own fault for not farming some OS relics with World Quests. There is usually an OS one every day or two. So again DPS artifact. You are welcome.<br />

Would love to know where they said they wanted to make healers more viable in the open world. Because all I have as a 890 Resto is Lava Burst, Flame Shock, Chain Lightning and Lightning Bolt. And they hit like shit even with the guaranteed crit on Lava Burst from Flame Shock.</div></div><hr />

The issue I am having with many of the responses is acting like the devs are flat out killing character progression. The intent is just dampen the explosion in gear power compared to before.

I would be against a linear scaling but this is not that. Complaints over lack of testing in PTR and with it the ahead of time knowledge of such a change does have its point.<br />

Also if the devs had created a new end game zone then the zone would of still gave healers shit and low ilvl players would be struggling even more.</div></div><hr />

Better still when you can kill 4 or 5 things in that time. But is there a point where that goes too far?&quot;<br />
<br />
No. I like one shotting things. Why in the world would they think the world should scale with gear? If gear power is too out of control, don't have it scale up so much. What is the point of gear if it doesn't make you more powerful? <br />
<br />
This is getting way too much like the launch of Diablo 3. The RNG, the endless enemy levels, prestige leveling (not in launch, but still D3). And most of all the &quot;you must play the game the way we want you too&quot; attitude. If people don't like blowing up enemies with their overpowered gear, they can either not wear it or not obtain it in the first place. And use instant casts to initiate aggro if people are one shotting everything before you get a chance to tag it. How hard is that?</div></div><hr />

Why not just decrease a bit the power progression of gear/artifacts then ?<br />
<br />
Ilvl scaling of mobs is a terrible design. It does not make the game interesting on a gameplay standpoint and it removes the whole point of farming gear in the first place. Being able to trivialise content is the only positive thing about the current gear threadmill and it s going away.</div></div><hr />

I don't want WQs to take as long as they did as when I was a fresh 110, but mowing them down is also boring. I enjoy the combat; one-shotting something isn't combat.</div></div><hr />

I was simply reporting on the issue. It was their initial plan to make it less painful to quest as a healer, hence why they reworked the &quot;dps rotations&quot; for healer specs in Legion, and gave you increased damage for every artifact trait purchased. <br />
<br />
However, I do not currently notice the scaling in the open-world, it was only during the scenario.</div></div><hr />

Could you link a source on that please as I asked the other person? Also if you want to naturally get things done quicker you should have a DPS artifact ready. No need to get insulting because someone has a different opinion than you.<br />

Feel free not to play Ret. Just don't come crying when you realize having a DPS spec to do the WQs helps a lot. Especially when it takes like half an hour- an hour to do half the traits even more.

<br />
Also if the devs had created a new end game zone then the zone would of still gave healers shit and low ilvl players would be struggling even more.<br />
<br />
Have you considered there might be other ways to resolve this issue? Here are a couple of them:<br />
1) do not make the gear scale so ridiculously. Every 15 ilvls is about 50k DPS increase, considering we start at around 200k DPS at fresh 110 (~800) and you can get to 890 without trying too hard, you are looking at more than double the power from just first tier of raids alone.<br />
<br />
2) seriously, not everyone has to have access to the highest levels of gear. giving casual people steady and reliable access to 895+ gear doesn't exactly help either. If only the dedicated mythic raiders were able to attain this kind of power instead of every Joe Shmoe there, being able to 1 shot mobs at these levels wouldn't be nearly as big of an issue.<br />
<br />
3) there's plenty of catch up mechanisms in the game as it is. I really don't get why fresh characters have to be able to be 100% effective in new open world content. Why shouldn't you have to get some gear before you can contribute meaningfully to the latest war efforts? Say, Broken isles was balanced around ilvl 820 char killing mobs in 12-15 seconds, Broken Shore could be balanced around ilvl 865 char doing that. You could go there earlier, but you'd struggle, no harm done. With mythics giving 865, getting above that ilvl will be fairly quick (2 weeks tops would be my expectation), and if you really really really want the new players to be competitive in the new content right away, you could always just make some excuse to scale them up to 865 for that particular content. The tech for it is there...<br />
<br />
Even if the mob scaling tech worked as they wanted it to, it'd mean, they nerfed everyone's power progression by 50%.<br />
<br />
Well, I was considering renewing my sub for the patch, but with this, I probably won't.</div></div><hr />

Talk about dishonesty! And weren’t the developers talking about improving communication? Yet they again deliberately lie and they wonder why the relationship between players and developers are deteriorating – get a clue Blizz!<br />
<br />
I don’t trust a single thing they say anymore. No difference now from Blizz developers and the average politician.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Feel free not to play Ret. Just don't come crying when you realize having a DPS spec to do the WQs helps a lot. Especially when it takes like half an hour- an hour to do half the traits even more. How is it stupid logic to have a DPS weapon with half decent traits and relics so you can blitz through World Quests faster than you would in a Healer spec?<br />
<br />
I'm not going to go through hours of Developer Q&amp;A's just to prove to you something that they have said, you could just look at the design of the healers, they all have damage abilities, damage enhancing talents (i'm not sure about ALL the specs but i'm pretty sure), putting traits in your artifacts increases your damage (which they even buffed with 7.2) and the Artifact system incentivizes you to focus on one spec, (not as much now that you can catch up extremely quickly but still) <br />
<br />
And i'm not crying because DPS is making it easier to make WQ, I already knew that I'm not retarded, what I'm saying is that it's stupid that healers could solo World Quests because they had a lot of gear and now they can't as well. <br />
<br />
The scaling system is completely stupid, if you're a DPS Heal or Tank it's stupid. Just saying &quot;lol just go DPS for WQs&quot; just takes attention off the real problem : that the ilvl scaling is stupid, and on top of being stupid it hinders healers. You can't just write off the problem by saying &quot;just go OS&quot;</div></div><hr />

So you have no actual source then? Cool nice to know your whole argument has fallen apart. Also so what if they have damaging abilities? They have done for years.

My argument has fallen apart ? my argument is that Scaling with ILVL shouldn't exist and that you waving off the problem as &quot;lol get a dps spec&quot; trigerred me, but I guess only Blizzard quotes counts as proof that they want healers to DPS, how stupid am I to think that the actual implementations of them boosting healer damage would matter, silly me.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekobaka</div><div class="date">2017-03-29, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Have you considered there might be other ways to resolve this issue? Here are a couple of them:<br />
1) do not make the gear scale so ridiculously. Every 15 ilvls is about 50k DPS increase, considering we start at around 200k DPS at fresh 110 (~800) and you can get to 890 without trying too hard, you are looking at more than double the power from just first tier of raids alone.<br />
<br />
2) seriously, not everyone has to have access to the highest levels of gear. giving casual people steady and reliable access to 895+ gear doesn't exactly help either. If only the dedicated mythic raiders were able to attain this kind of power instead of every Joe Shmoe there, being able to 1 shot mobs at these levels wouldn't be nearly as big of an issue.<br />
<br />
3) there's plenty of catch up mechanisms in the game as it is. I really don't get why fresh characters have to be able to be 100% effective in new open world content. Why shouldn't you have to get some gear before you can contribute meaningfully to the latest war efforts? Say, Broken isles was balanced around ilvl 820 char killing mobs in 12-15 seconds, Broken Shore could be balanced around ilvl 865 char doing that. You could go there earlier, but you'd struggle, no harm done. With mythics giving 865, getting above that ilvl will be fairly quick (2 weeks tops would be my expectation), and if you really really really want the new players to be competitive in the new content right away, you could always just make some excuse to scale them up to 865 for that particular content. The tech for it is there...<br />
<br />
Even if the mob scaling tech worked as they wanted it to, it'd mean, they nerfed everyone's power progression by 50%.<br />
<br />
Well, I was considering renewing my sub for the patch, but with this, I probably won't.<br />
<br />
For you I agree in waiting until you see what Blizzard tunes things. <br />
<br />
To be more clear this is the path the devs chose when reusing existing content rather than creating a new zone. There have been complaints before about the ilvl requirements for post launch endgame zones. Perhaps the devs could of used a hybrid of scaling up to x ilvl. Given the lack of testing and the apperance of what appears to be a bug that was seen in the ilvl scaling of last expansions dungeons that would of still been fail.<br />
<br />
I do agree the devs should of been more upfront about this. They can still say hey this is going to happen but we want to tune it withing more respectable levels. They chose not to and made a mess of it.</div></div><hr />

You provided no source to backup your claim that they said &quot;healers and tanks should be capable in solo content&quot;. When you provide the source you have an argument. We good?<br />

<br />
Healers and tanks ability to quest in itself is another topic that should be directed as such with it having an overall larger impact beyond just current endgame. If this was a new endgame zone then healers and tanks would still be dealing with endgame content aimed at DPS. Lets not forget the ability to respect with ease.<br />
<br />
The activities these players are participating are considered part of endgame and if they want devs to change how non-DPS roles interact with said endgame then they need to take their direction to the devs to accommodate those roles. Expecting to faceroll content that was poorly designed for them from the get go just because they are wearing purples is silly.</div></div><hr />

Legion Q&amp;A 2016-06-16<br />

<br />
Healer Leveling and Talents<br />
<br />
The team put effort into improving healer damage and healer soloing in Legion, so players are now able to level more as a healer more efficiently than they were able to in previous expansions.<br />
A Holy Priest and Shadow Priest won't kill things at the same speed, but the overall difference in time to complete a zone is not meaningfully different now.<br />
DPS still has a small advantage in leveling speed, but healers no longer take 2-3x as long to kill enemies.<br />
There are talents and Artifact traits that will help you level faster as a healer.<br />
You can change your talents around freely when you queue and arrive in a new dungeon, so there is no need to go back to town.<br />

As a H priest myself I'm in no way saying healing specs should deal as much or even close to the amount of dps main DPS specs can, I just don't see from a game play view why we have to go from 3 times as long to kill something to 5 times as long than a DPS class can?

So how about they just remove the nice gold dragons from the mob's portrait after you hit a certain Ilvl then? That way you would not feel cheap beating up a non elite....<br />
<br />
Do you refuse to go into old raids or dungeons for transmog, achievements, pets, mounts, etc because the &quot;golden&quot; mobs in there die too fast?<br />

People complain about things dying too fast, but still go and get better gear that causes this. Don't want to one shot something, quest naked. You want things to be more difficult, make it difficukt for yourself. Just do not assume and push that opinion on others.</div></div><hr />

I remember mages can burst quite high quickly. I do see the issue for healers/tanks. But overall for dps doesn't seem like nearly as big of an issue as people are making it out to be. Most of my guild didn't know about the change and they still cleared wq in under 3 min each. The healers on the other hand... yeah they might need adjusting again if 100 mil is the hp of the boss they get too..... unless that healer is disc.</div></div><hr />

Sure, it's a silly situation where taking off a piece of gear makes the game easier. And blizzard acknowledges this, and it will be fixed soon.<br />

I'm sorry, but I actually like to use 3-4 abilities (at least) on a mob before it dies, and maybe in that time I can react to something the mob does, so I feel like I'm playing a game. I could mop the floor with anything in Broken Isles and &quot;death-touching&quot; mobs was/is a very real thing. The only way I had some compelling gameplay was to round up 5+ mobs, and even then a quick AOE would seriously destroy their HP. And I'm not even ilevel 900. My BM hunter has literally been a murder machine.<br />
<br />
This isn't killing character power or progression or anything, stop overreacting. EVERY change they make gets this kind of crying. &quot;Nighthold gear doesn't make me powerful enough&quot; &quot;ok we'll make you more powerful&quot; &lt;power spike totally invalidates open-world questing&gt; &quot;maybe we should fix this&quot; &quot;OMG DON'T NERF MEEE&quot; ...<br />

100% this. NO ONE wanted this world scaling. My chores take long enough as is.<br />

One - it's clear that the intent is too not make it total faceroll, but still have gear make a difference. It's just overtuned right now, which they admit.

I think what Ion said what the purpose of this was is pretty clear and easy to understand. What's kind of disapointing is that for all of their talk of being more transparent, and having better communication, they slipped this in, without it being tested on the PTR, and giving players a chance to try it, and discuss it - especially after having said they would never do it. They purposely hid it, and that just...well, it sucks. <br />
<br />
When you treat your audience like children, don't be shocked and surprised when they act like children. All of this could have been avoided with one more week on the PTR, announcing they were trying this, letting players try it and having actual feedback to tune it, and players would have known it's coming, and that it's not a big deal. (In a better, tweaked state)<br />
<br />
Blizzard owns this one, they handled it badly - and as usual, Ion has to post a wall of text rationalizing something he had WEEKS to test on the PTR, and avoided this blowup on the forums by explaining it before it released. They know how players are, and how they react to stuff like this. I have to seriously question Ion's leadership, when he keeps doing this over and over. <br />
<br />
The real/next issue is how players will react to the rest of the 7.2 content....that is, when it unlocks. Hoo boy. You wanted gated content like TBC? Well, you got it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, this reflects a deliberate change, but it's also not working exactly as we intended. The scaling may be too steep, and the fact that unequipping a piece of gear can ever be helpful is a bug in the system. We'll be looking into making changes to correct this in the very near future.<br />
<br />

It's not a matter of it being steep, it's the matter of it existing. Absolutely retarded decision.</div></div><hr />

Yup, agree with you on this. Even just a proactive note that said &quot;whoops we screwed up&quot; would have been better than a reactive note like this. It's rarely the best approach, but announcing a mistake before your customers find it is generally a wise move.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they're trying to kill the game, I think they're just trying way, way too hard to dictate what a player experiences in the game - &quot;you can have this, but at our pre-determined rate, and only up to a level we think is good, and only how we tell you how to use it&quot;. They're even trying to engineer the experience a player has getting a reward - it's based on their expectations of how they think you should feel - which is even more ludicrous with their newfound love for RNG. <br />
<br />
There's a lot of different terms you could use - over-engineered, on rails experiences, anal retentive...but what i do agree with is it just doesn't sound fun. Instead of &quot;Hey, lets make a dungeon about centuars, and at the end, have a elemental goddess in a bikini! Yeah! That's awesome!&quot;, it's &quot;We ran the spreadsheet and we found that player's happiness at a drop is 0.0234% less exciting if it's not random, we've been thinking a lot about that lately, so here's some more tweaks to our spreadsheets&quot;<br />

What gets me is how strongly people objected to repeated proposals for some sort of rolling cap on AP to prevent it being possible to grind away to infinity, vigorously defended the lottery playstyle of Titanforging and RNG Legiondaries, and are now turning around to defend a patch with some of the most obtrusive time gating in the game's history and which deliberately weakens the relative power of all that RNG gear they clamored for in the first place.<br />
<br />
Seconded. I was excited for a moment. Played about 3-5 hours today. Now I'm looking at the map and go &quot;that's it&quot;? I have to wait for new WQs to happen to &quot;grind&quot; rep? Or that the stupid ship opens new portals...whenever? Uargh.<br />
Not to mention I need to grind to continue my Order Hall? Hell-o, now that's time gating supreme.</div></div><hr />

Though the system will still be in place. The devs are just clarifying the tuning changes.</div></div><hr />

Cry babies huh? The created a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. All it did is make the game more tedious to play. It didn't make it more fun or challenging, just tedious.</div></div><hr />

The scaling is barely noticeable. If anything I'd say it's noticeable on a healer so the scaling can just be changed for them.<br />
The scaling is actually EXTREMELY noticeable. I mean common it's obvious. Just do 3-4 WQ with only one ring. Then equip it again and you'll take nearly the double ammount of time.<br />
<br />
Mobs health jump from 1,5mio to over 3mio. How its that &quot;barely noticeable&quot; ?</div></div><hr />

&quot;F&quot; those guys are stupid. What shit for brains designer or developer got in the meeting and said yes, lets make quest mobs harder to kill simply because players get stronger?<br />
<br />
Their stupidity knows no bounds. Yes, lets make wow even more tedious. WTF!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2017-03-30, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;We wanted to get tester's raw and honest feedback about it when they encountered it themselves&quot;. <br />
<br />
What a load of steaming hot horseshit. Nothing else in the patch was treated this way. Granted, they'll never admit they slipped this in, hoping nobody would notice. Just like how they didn't bother to have the time gates on everything on the PTR, didn't tell people what they would be, and in some cases (from what I've read) didn't even have ANY gating on the content on the PTR. So it's lies by omission, because they knew the real numbers and time gates would be unpopular. In other words, the feedback from the PTR is flawed - because they're not testing the same content as what was released.<br />
<br />
This is just not a good stance for the devs to take, hiding what's really coming like that. It speaks volumes about the leadership, or lack of it, on the WOW team. This is not a team that's confident about their design, if they have to hide or camoflage or change content for testing. It's just shady.<br />
<br />
And, for everyone that didnt feel that much of a difference, that's not the point. It's how they handled it, and item level scaling is a slippery slope a lot of players don't want to go down, they have concerns, legit concerns, how this will play out in the future, if they're going to implement this more. It's more about the devs taking steps in a direction that's not popular, not the specific numbers you might be experiencing. It's the devs trying to control too much of the player experience - and doing it because they threw too much power at players too soon into the expansion.<br />
