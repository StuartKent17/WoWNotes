<br />
Rob Pardo Leaving Blizzard Entertainment<br />
Every ending is a beginning and today marks a new beginning for me.<br />
<br />
After 17 years at Blizzard, with long and careful contemplation, I have made a difficult and bittersweet but ultimately exciting decision to pursue the next chapter in my life and career.<br />
<br />
Before I even joined Blizzard, I was already a huge fan of the company and its games. In particular, I was extremely passionate about the emerging genre of real-time strategy games. It was a dream come true when I was given the opportunity to work on StarCraft, which at the time was being created by a very small team by today’s standards. It was tremendously fulfilling to get to know everyone on the team personally and to contribute our energies toward a shared goal in such a creative and engaging environment.<br />
<br />
Blizzard Entertainment has been simply the best place in the world to be a game designer. The best aspect of designing games at Blizzard is that the entire company is passionate about the gameplay within each and every product. From the executive team to customer service to our global offices, every single person is a player and contributes to making the best possible games. It’s for very good reason that the first credit on every Blizzard game is “Game Design by Blizzard Entertainment.”<br />
<br />
I’m really proud of the contributions I was able to make to Blizzard’s accomplishments. From building lasting games, to supporting the growth of eSports, to extending the Warcraft world into a feature film, and of course to being able to celebrate our shared passions with the Blizzard community online and at BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
The Blizzard community is ultimately the reason why we come to work every day and pour our souls into every world and experience we create. Blizzard’s players are the most passionate in the world and your commitment and dedication are truly awesome to behold. Creating entertainment for you has been an incredible opportunity, and I know that you will continue to grow and become even stronger as a community over the years to come. It has been so meaningful on a personal level to help create joy for all of you.<br />
<br />
I’m looking forward to new challenges in my career, but I will always cherish the time I spent with you all and the amazing and collaborative teams at Blizzard. It was both satisfying and humbling, and it made me a better developer and a better person. I look forward to playing Blizzard games as a player for many years to come. Most important, now I have plenty of time to learn how to build a competitive Hearthstone deck.<br />
<br />
As to what I will be doing next, I don’t have an answer for you yet . . . but I will “when it’s ready.” My priorities are to enjoy the summer with my family, play plenty of games, and think about what’s next. The game industry is such an exciting place right now with PC gaming thriving, the new consoles, mobile games, and virtual reality becoming an actual reality. It’s like having an empty quest log and going into a new zone for the first time.<br />
<br />
In the past, I haven’t been the most avid Twitter user, but I’ll strive to do better and keep you updated there—@Rob_Pardo (https://twitter.com/Rob_Pardo). Please stay in touch!<br />

<br />
I see that a pattern is happening here. The same pattern that happened when Blizzard North had disagreements with how decisions were being made from the higher ups and a huge amount of extremely good developers left Blizzard. IE the developers of Diablo 1/2 and many of the vanilla starcraft and wow developers couldnt take it anymore. Greg street has bailed now as well as Rob. Things are getting worse and worse and less like a company that cares about their consumers and games and more about their profits. Im sure we can thank Bobby K for that.</div></div><hr />

I made a video with my thoughts after the initial shock of the news was absorbed. You can see it here if you want: http://youtu.be/-bM2flQMPxA<br />

I wish Rob Pardo the best and I thank him for all the work he has done on the games I enjoy so much, and the impact he has made on the video game industry as a whole!</div></div><hr />

17 years is also a lifetime at a studio in the gaming industry especially when you consider the indusrty standard of grueling working hours and god-complex riddled devs to deal with.</div></div><hr />

Well his last work for WoW was TBC and then he joined again for WoD. And the bolded part of your comment is basically the half of Alpha and Beta of WoD.<br />
<br />
Soooo, what if it his fault in the first place?</div></div><hr />

Rob was the creative director/officer for ALL of Blizzard Entertainment. I don't know how to feel about this. With the expansion looming and lots of changes being made to WoW, I can't help but wonder what is going on now.<br />
<br />
I don't think this bodes well, and I have a bad feeling about this.<br />
<br />
He wasn't associated with WoW after TBC until WoD.</div></div><hr />

not likely to be honest. when a dude of his position leaves it isn't a quick all of a sudden sort of thing. the dev teams and people in the studio have likely known he was leaving for monthsand any impact to the development of the game has likely happened already for better or worse.</div></div><hr />

I find it funny people screamed for years that Greg Street needed to be fired, he leaves to work at Riot and all of a sudden the &quot;reason&quot; in so many peoples minds for the &quot;downfall&quot; of WoW wasn't the reason, and he bailed cuz he didn't like the direction of things that so many people thought he was responsible for. <br />
<br />
How about Rob wants a fresh start somewhere else, professionals do that all the time. Same with Greg. Wish Rob all the best in his future endeavors.</div></div><hr />

17 years is a long time at one place. Probably a combination of him wanting to move on and changes at Blizzard. Out with the old in with the new. Which could be good or bad. Time will tell. People complain Blizz is not the same. Yes no kidding but no company ever stays the same these days and nothing last forever. I don't agree with everything Blizz does by far but still enjoy their games as a whole. They are still one of the tops in the industry but even that wont last for ever. Changes good or bad are inevitable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely true, which is why these changes are likely due to a creative designer hitting the door.<br />
<br />
This might be the thing that was going on at Blizzard. I mean 17 years, you don't leave a job after 17 years. You get fired from a job after 17 years. He was damn near retirement, and was damn near a colonial member.<br />
<br />
Sure, he might be crying on a bed of money and can retire anyways. But you don't throw his status and contributions away after that long.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zephre</div><div class="date">2014-07-03, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He hasn't done much in recent years prior to work on WOD wasn't his last involvement with WoW back during TBC?<br />
<br />
Either way he'll be a loss to a company that's grown used to him over the years he's worked there. I personally think he should of done more to stop Blizzard implementing micro-transactions since he himself supposedly opposed them back during 2008.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about Rob wants a fresh start somewhere else, professionals do that all the time. Same with Greg. Wish Rob all the best in his future endeavors.<br />
<br />
Not after 17 years you don't. In some design cores, you have factions of people. We all know it and see it at our jobs, in varying degrees. These people, especially at the top, pull the strings for direction in departments. Time will only tell if these factions make a positive impact at this level of design and development. You have in house fighting in all rungs of the ladder, is this fighting or is this new blood? <br />
<br />
Is this a push for new direction or is this a departure because of foreseen direction and he didn't agree?<br />
<br />

He's most likely signed an agreement that he can't work at a rivalling company until after a certain period of time has passed. I'm pretty sure he has his next job lined up already but can't tell because of legal consequences.</div></div><hr />

This might be the thing that was going on at Blizzard. I mean 17 years, you don't leave a job after 17 years. You get fired from a job after 17 years. He was damn near retirement, and was damn near a colonial member.<br />
<br />
Sure, he might be crying on a bed of money and can retire anyways. But you don't throw his status and contributions away after that long.<br />
Tell that to John Carmack, Cliff Blezinsky, Roy Muzyka, Greg Zeschuck,Hironobu Sakaguchi,Keiji Inafune,,Shinji Mikami, and Hideki Kamiya. all industry veterans who walked away from thier long standing and famous development studios in order to pursue different ideas and oppurtunities than the studios they worked in were providing them.</div></div><hr />

that's assuming his new job is in California though right? if he goes to work in a state/country where it will be upheld then he still has to abide by it. although I onestly don't think the dude is going to begrudge himself a few months of down time to build bird houses or whatevs.</div></div><hr />

What do you call it when someone unexpectedly isn't employed anymore and doesn't have a back up plan? I call it 'being fired' since you don't quit a job of 17 years and you're at the top. <br />

<br />
His OLD job's contract is what matters. You think his new employer would make him sign a contract saying he can't work for them? :)<br />
<br />
That old job was in California, so any non-compete clause in that contract would have been automatically void.<br />

<br />
I was going to say the same thing. I do think one of the big problems with these 12 month gaps at the end of the expansion is that the older devs are just too comfortable in their positions. It happens to all the developers once they get a name. You need to have fear and hunger to make video games because that is the only thing that is going to keep you working the hours necessary to keep to a schedule. I think most of the higher ups at WOW are just very very comfortable and don´t feel any fear or any real hunger anymore. While not keeping to their schedule, they are off playing with choppers and stuff like that.</div></div><hr />

I quit my job at a studio because of stress and disagreements with management. I've taken a break from the industry until I deem myself capable to get back into it without causing myself more unneeded stress. It's a thing. People do this without being fired.</div></div><hr />

Unexpectedly? To you perhaps. This would have been in the works for a few months. Blizzard have no obligation to make things public as soon as they happen.<br />

From a lore point of view, WoD is a trainwreck; not to mention various other reservations that I have. I'm sure in terms of OOC features, such as dungeon/raid fights and other such technicalities, it's doing fine. Lore is the deal-breaker for me, however.</div></div><hr />

Rob Pardo (born June 9, 1970) was the Chief Creative Officer at Blizzard Entertainment[1], resigning on July 3, 2014[2].

In 2006, he was named by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[3]</div></div><hr />

You don't quit a job of 17 years without having a back-up, and he doesn't have a back-up. He got shit-canned. Come to terms.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you. Seems very odd to just up and quit such a high ranking and presumably high paying, job at the drop of a hat with no future plans lined up. I think people at Blizzard are finally going to be held responsible for their positions and the declining state WoW has been in since the year long drought at the end of WotLK. <br />
<br />
Frankly, I'm fine with that because it will make those that don't get fired actually care and start to be creative and innovative again instead of the same boring stagnation we've seen for years now. This is the second big name down, Ghostcrawler being the first, and I hope to see a few more too unless things change.</div></div><hr />

The only mad person here would be you, you have a hard on for the thought of a Blizzard employee being fired it would seem.<br />
<br />
No proof to present your point = you're just as likely to be making shit up. Get over yourself. I don't give a shit about who this dude is, I just dislike people such as yourself making shit up because you WANT it to be true.</div></div><hr />

Rob Pardo isn't famous outside of Blizzard. Isn't even known to the people he served. All these people you listed said, they left unhappy. You don't leave a company like Blizzard after 17 years, it rarely happens and to claim otherwise is a joke. <br />
<br />
Time will tell why Pardo left, but I don't think he did.<br />
<br />
a standard no. a precedent yes. and all the names I listed had been with the companies nearly as long as Pardo and workd on projects with nearly as much impact on the industry. so whether he left happy or not isn't the issue but precedent shows sometimes you do leave a company you have been with forever it just happens that you often have a good reason.</div></div><hr />

It might be that Blizzard asked him nicely to give some time before announcing his new job as not to draw too much attention to the company (especially if it is another game company). He might have left as the other company wanted him enough to offer a really good package.<br />
<br />
Somehow, I doubt that a rival company is going to go out of its way to make a better offer to a guy at the top of a company that's managed to lose nearly 50% of its sub revenue over the last 4 years. That's not exactly 'resume' material right there.

Protar, please don't shout more about sexism on your soap box. That is something that this thread really doesn't need. Yrel is proof that they are moving towards giving female characters more prominent roles in WoW. <br />

So if you're not a lead but a VP(?), been involved with the early inception of the original (small) team (and nearly every aaa title?), interviewed several times about a game, but leave before it's widely known about... :confused: as to why not being a lead disqualifies his clout for ANY game branded by blizzard. Reminded me of how WoW was almost originally WoD(iablo), got pushed back on the table, and then those guys started bailing when that shifted. WoW seemed to work out...<br />
<br />
The sky isn't falling. Just seemed like familiar stuff.<br />
<br />
17 years is a long time to work somewhere. Maybe he was ready for something else, maybe he was frustrated and ready, maybe his family wants 6 months away from corporate america. Who knows. Any studio would hire him w/o a resume.<br />
<br />
Just struck me that he was very passionate about new titles. Guess it won't be a blizzard one.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure. Mutual termination happens all the time. The company gives the person time to find another job to say he left without saying he was fired. Considering the success he had at Blizzard it was at least owed to him.<br />

Basically the only people who are saying that are people who want to turn games into the next ´battleground´ for sexual diversity and representation. They won´t be happy until every game is required to have gays or lesbians represented. All Rob Pardo said is that they ( Blizzard) just doesn´t look at game where you kill dragons as the right place to try to make social commentary... gameplay and fun is their focus.<br />
<br />
It is the same problem with a lot of places. I get it that for many people gay rights are a huge part of their life, and the most important thing they are working on. But you can´t go into every industry and then demand that industry have the same ´passion´ towards gay rights as you have. ´you know what, I support gay marriage... but we are just not going to make 5.4% of our NPCs openly gay because that is the proportion in the real world´. Sexual orientation isn´t really discussed in games. Think about how many NPCs there are in the game world... do we really need to know their private lives? Do we want Blizzard to add a line of text to every 20th quest to let us know that character is gay?</div></div><hr />

You don't think losing 50% of its main revenue stream to be 'losing its ass?'<br />
<br />
How many more millions do they need to lose before you'd consider them to be 'losing their ass?' Because, I can assure you that executives don't give a 4.5 million drop in subs a pass because they still have 7.5 million subs. They lose their shit. In a hurry. 4.5 million subs is a lot of stable reliable monthly income, the 'best' kind of income.</div></div><hr />

Reading comprehension isn't one of your strong suits I take it.<br />
<br />
He said in the first paragraph that it was his decision to leave. Nowhere did he imply that he got fired. You know what people say when they get fired? &quot;I'm now exploring other career paths.&quot; They never say I made a decision to leave because it would be a lie. <br />
<br />
The sub loss doesn't really mean dick either. What other MMO has had 7 to 12 million subs? None. He's still will be a sought after player in the industry. <br />

Funny you should say that because he has never seen a sub-loss while being a designer for WoW. He was the lead designer for WoW and TBC, and a designer for WoD. If you don't think the big game studios are gonna pursue him then you are incredibly ignorant.</div></div><hr />

This happens all the time in every industry. A single success sets a standard? That's a joke, and GC was a voice and a face, he was actually in charge of the UI. Everyone knows how the standard UI looks. How many add-ons do you have for your UI? Exactly. The standard UI is a joke to say the least.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know it goes BEYOND just the buttons you press. Then we also have raid UI addons, UI for Heirlooms and bags, anything people produce is almost ALWAYS better then a billion dollar company is a farce. <br />

Heirloom and Tabard UI and storage was GC job, nice one on that. Not even going to make WoD release.</div></div><hr />

If he got fired, they legally have to announce it as a termination. They're a public company, they're not allowed to lie about such things.<br />

Did he make a joke on twitter and people are butthurt? Or does he actually have a history of legitimately being a bigot?<br />
<br />
It was something he said at a conference last month regarding equality in video games. He pretty much stated that it wasn't something Blizzard should concern themselves with, and that all the devs he's worked with are guys who grew up with comic books and they wanted to make epic stories. He later stated that while he isn't against female devs there &quot;aren't any applications landing on my desk&quot; or some such, and that its &quot;the industry, not Blizzard&quot; that is the root of the issue.<br />
<br />
I honestly think that he was forced to resign now that I've had a little look around. This is abrupt, and happens only a month after a major PR disaster (which, oddly enough, was never really discussed on MMO Champion - guess you're all too busy complaining about minor things) and lacks any real plans for the future. I think he upset too many people and Blizzard wanted him to apologise and he refused - hense being given the handshake.<br />
<br />
As for my views on sexism in WoW - it exists. Its relatively minor for the most part, but its so common its become death by a thousand cuts. How many awesome female heroes are there? I know its Medival Fantasy, but Fantasy is supposed to be... Well, fantastical! I'd like to see more variety and better writing and spotlights for the feminine heroes we already have. Even this new Yrel character seems to be overshadowed by all the males around her!</div></div><hr />

I see that a pattern is happening here. The same pattern that happened when Blizzard North had disagreements with how decisions were being made from the higher ups and a huge amount of extremely good developers left Blizzard. IE the developers of Diablo 1/2 and many of the vanilla starcraft and wow developers couldnt take it anymore. Greg street has bailed now as well as Rob. Things are getting worse and worse and less like a company that cares about their consumers and games and more about their profits. Im sure we can thank Bobby K for that.<br />

I know 17 years is a long time, but I just can't shake the feeling that he just doesn't like the direction the company has gone (nickel and diming players) and actually meant what he said about WoW all those years ago:<br />
&quot;We chose to go with the subscription-based model instead of that [microtransaction] approach. We've taken the approach that we want players to feel like it's a level playing field once they're in WoW. Outside resources don't play into it -- no gold buying, etc. We take a hard line stance against it. What you get out of microtransactions is kind of the same thing and I think our player base would feel betrayed by it. I think that's something else you have to decide on up-front instead of implementing later&quot;.<br />

Blizzcon; all the changes recently in alpha/beta (even if its the nature of such phases). <br />
It could mean good or bad things; well hear next week lol.. But then we will never know either way because it's probably majority wise the things we DON'T know yet.<br />
Cant wait till next week. <br />
We need new blood (the right kind) more then ever right now anyway.<br />
I mean no offense towards Rob in that way; it's a business after all.<br />
Best of luck on your journeys Rob.<br />
<br />
Its probably a pretty stressful environment for them right now in this phase. They are so used to being on a perch; and now they have an obvious decline; which would obviously cause a lot more whip cracking in the office lol.<br />
I'm not for many of the recent changes made in Beta :/ but its Beta. Blizz is a stubborn mule tho so I don't give any hope saying its only Beta will turn anything around lol.<br />
Regardless these guys work very hard and thx for the years of entertainment they have given.</div></div><hr />

Thinking that WoW would stay at 12 million subs and above still after 10 years is moronic. Anyone with a shred of common sense knew that it wouldn't last, that it would decline. Doesn't mean the game is any less loved by those that still play it nor that it is a failure.<br />

&gt;_&gt; I'm talking about other games never hitting 4.5m subs to be able to lose them. We're all well aware of how many subs WoW hit in WoTLK.

<br />
WoW was NEVER going to stay at 12+ million players. Stop acting like a fool.<br />
<br />
People grow tired, they move on, they grow bored, the game changes in ways that some like and others don't, people trying it out just to follow the hype leave since they're not all that invested into it. Thinking that WoW would still be at 12+ million players after 10 years if they had done things differently is just delusional and the usual &quot;My views make up reality!&quot; way of thinking so often seen in people on the internet. FACT is that nothing with a limited lifespan stays on top once it gets there.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ForestWalker</div><div class="date">2014-07-03, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having been reading the forum now for a bit in regard to Rob leaving I am a bit sadden to see the focus being less on wish someone good luck and more about personal theories, tinfoil hatting, discussions of bigotry, and a need to try and be right. When a claim is made the person making the claim is given the burden of proof that it is fact and true, so to claim that his leaving is due to the loss of subs requires proof. Merely stating the same statistics without providing new information is futile and merely a stalling tactic. Homophobia is a stupid word because you aren't afraid of gay people, unless you fear them teaching you how to dress to attract women, introducing you to the mass quantities of females they know, or helping you with the inane things you probably don't care about in a bid to make you more appealing to the general public. If the man left under ill terms it isn't likely he would say so, but nothing posted so far screamed &quot;I'm saying this because I'm being forced too.&quot; It is possible he was asked to leave and resigned with dignity, or maybe he decided he wanted a new career field. The world of what ifs is a futile place to live because it leads no where. What if a frog had wings? He wouldn't bump his ass when he hopped. I like the game, I enjoy it a lot and the current content doesn't bore me for the moment. I know it is a cycle and when the wheel turns we dive back in till we reach this point again. Blizzard adds, subtracts, divides and reworks to create an experience they hope we like, and when we don't we bid adieu for greener pastures. Some come back, some never do but like many things in life this is the way of it. So if you are unhappy why do you linger? If the game is terrible why are you here? Time invested isn't a good enough reason, but perhaps flame wars, trolling, or merely being negative helps you stay. Whatever it is if you continue to contribute your money to what you do not enjoy or believe in then you are a hypocrite and should be content with that knowledge.</div></div><hr />

There's no need to get mad and start calling people names, dude. Just because the game has lost half its player base since Wrath ended is no reason to get upset. The developers are just straight up drool-cup retarded and their mistakes caused this. Making excuses for them like 'lol life span' is nice and all, but it doesn't get away from the fact that we didn't start seeing losses until Cata launched and they herped and derped away a couple million subs.

<br />
While I don't necessarily agree with Infernix' commentary, he's not saying that.<br />
<br />
What he's saying is that the game took a very obvious shift in its core design philosophy going into Cataclysm, and the subscriptions have plummeted since then. Chalking that up purely to the life cycle of a product isn't being particularly fair to the design decisions that were made; they could easily have contributed to this downfall and, in fact, it's extremely likely that they did.</div></div><hr />

No. The game lost millions much before Cata went live. The only difference is the game was newer and not everyone with a passing interest had tried it so the losses were covered by the overall retention.

<br />
A valid enough thing to say, and certainly a contributing factor to the game's decline, but this isn't something we can say for certain. Correlation doesn't necessarily equal causation, we all know that, but it'd be a bit hard-nosed to suggest that the subscription loss is completely independent of design that deliberately marginalized the game's biggest percentage of players, after Wrath's design (with a different team) brought them all in.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Nope, I was around for that. We lost our first big chunk of subs in the lead up to Cata's launch and that was blamed on China or something. Once we got into Cata, though, we had steady consistent perpetual sub loss throughout the lifespan of Cata, right up to the end when 4.3 and LFR's launching stabilized the sub-loss for a few months before MOP started and the subs plummeted again. <br />
<br />
Cata and onward has been complete and utter failure in terms of stopping the sub loss, much less drawing back old players and drawing in new players. I mean, literally, the entirety of the game has sucked ass since Wrath ended.</div></div><hr />

If the game is &quot;getting worse because I feel it is&quot;, why are you against replacing employees?<br />
<br />
Because Rob Pardo wasn't directly involved with Cataclysm and Mists. The current team took over pretty much going into Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe but my point is that he didn't have a role as lead designer on WoD so it is in my personal belief that him leaving won't have a super huge impact on WoD.</div></div><hr />

No, they frequent an MMO forum and probably others, AND don't live under a rock.</div></div><hr />

C'mon, the guy literally just said &quot;I don't want any homo stuff in video games.&quot; I can understand if somebody doesn't care either way, I don't expect or ask for everyone to be passionate about every cause.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pua</div><div class="date">2014-07-03, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope, I was around for that. We lost our first big chunk of subs in the lead up to Cata's launch and that was blamed on China or something. Once we got into Cata, though, we had steady consistent perpetual sub loss throughout the lifespan of Cata, right up to the end when 4.3 and LFR's launching stabilized the sub-loss for a few months before MOP started and the subs plummeted again.<br />
<br />
Essentially, there was something of a loss near the end of WotLK (a more natural saturation point, given the way the game grew) and Cataclysm launched to the record subscriber number of 12 million. If we were talking about natural wastage and players leaving due to the normal life cycle, we'd have to ignore the fact that the number has fallen very sharply rather than gradually, and we'd also have to ignore the fact the design direction took a 180 from what the previous team thought was good for the game.</div></div><hr />

So when you said you didn't care if you were called a homophobe, what you actually meant was that you didn't care that you are a homophobe. Gotcha.<br />

The disgust is mutual don't worry. It's really sad that on this forum the guy calling out blatant homophobia is the bad guy.</div></div><hr />

I think it more likely that he simply meant:<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't want the issue of homosexuality to be prevalent in video games&quot;.<br />
<br />
Of course I could be wrong, but I can see why someone would have that view. It's a topic that shouldn't matter to anyone but, unfortunately, it does. Not wanting to see it in a video game, where it might attract unwanted attention (remember the Ji Firepaw incident?), is fair enough. I disagree, but I don't think it's an unfair stance.</div></div><hr />

Because its a lot easier to doomsay and bitch than it is to think up legitimate reasons.<br />

Maybe something you don't need to know and have no right to know? Jesus, a man quits his job he has been at for 17 years, that is a high-tier job and y'all all flip and act like the damn world is ending. Give the man some dang room and get off both his and Blizzard's back and unless you actually work there and know for certain of what is going on.</div></div><hr />

Can't help but agree a little bit here, though the conversation is straying a little off-topic, still.</div></div><hr />

Is the SWJ comment the new 'defense' against being called out on being bigotted? Because I've got to say, its extremely poor.</div></div><hr />
