A new arrival has just landed in the Blizzard Pet Store: the majestic Winged Guardian flying mount, a titan creation designed to protect Azeroth’s most ancient secrets. As with the Celestial Steed, this Guardian of the Titans will carry you across Azeroth as fast as your riding skill will take you. Head over to the Pet Store (http://us.blizzard.com/store/browse.xml?f=c:5,c:33#p1) to see this new addition and other World of Warcraft companions, and check out the FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=29845) for more information.<br />

<br />
pricisely, diverting effort from content we already pay for just to make a quick buck from suckers. there seems to be absolutely no charity involved in this one so it should be counted in the $14 blizzard already sucks out of millions of peoples pockets each month.<br />
<br />
Guess blizzards just glad there are suckers in the world who need to buy a digital mount to up their own self worth.</div></div><hr />

The encounter design team has nothing to do with this. It's a completely separate team that works on extensions to the game such as the Mobile Armory and purchasable mounts and pets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They need to decide which route to take either the pay monthly with everything covered by the sub (Including earning mounts and pets they are currently selling for profit, not the charity ones) or take the micro transaction route with no monthly fee.<br />
<br />
It seems that blizzard is getting more and more greedy as the years go buy, not happy with pretty much a monopoly in the MMO market, they want to squeeze yet more and more cash out of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think enough is enough. <br />
<br />
I'm considering moving to rift where services that you have to pay for as a loyal blizzard customer are free with rift (Server transfers for example)</div></div><hr />

Well rich boy, there's people out there that just can't give themselves the luxury of spending 25 dollars/17pounds/20 euros on a bunch of crappy pixels.<br />

'cept.. kinda prettier with the wings animation. I won't be purchasing this... or anything else for that matter. I am perfectly happy with the hundreds of mounts available to me. <br />

I'm not a hater though, that thing looks sick. I just can't justify spending real life cash on it since.. it's purely a vanity item. I would rather buy my trademark look Lumberjack Shirt. Don't buy it.. It's my look.</div></div><hr />

Everyone who donates gets something in return. Usually just a smug sense of satisfaction that their 10 bucks is totally going to help sort out some problem that has been around for centuries. Like when Bob Geldof ended poverty.</div></div><hr />

A mount makes you a noob? I know plenty of elite players who use celestial steed because they think &quot;it looks cool&quot;<br />

i know that is usually the reason given by everybody but tell me, so Blizz pays a full year to a team for doing 3 - 5 stuff in that entire year? that is a really waste of money, so off-course this team is not only for that, the team that make this is the Design Team, with includes the Encounters designs<br />

Since when has 25 dollars been alot? I mean my daily school coke zero costs in Norway 3-4 dollars. It's not that its much, it's that it is waste of money. Blizzard spent 1 night making this companion and are expecting millions of dollars to roll in. 25 dollar for a pixel mount, you can only use it when you're going to fly from destination to destination. There's nothing to brag about. You with that option.. I just bought 2, suck it whiners/haters you're going to have it hard in life. You think people wont buy it just because we can't afford it? It's far from that, it's that we know and learned the value of money. Since when is 25 dollars worth a GM typing .additem xxxxxx with their built mechanics? It's stupid and who ever buys this mount should think twice before doing it. Even if I had 5 billion of dollars right beside me I wouldn't buy it because I know it's a waste of money, but it seems like a stupidhead like you hasn't learned to understand that yet. I'm more than 100% sure that the most of the other on this forum have a better wealth / economy than what you ever will achieve in your life. Why? Because they think twice before acting.. Oh fuck I'm thirst.. *coke special* 4 cokes for the price of 3, But I only want 1 ... hmm fuck it I buy it.. Yepp that's you.</div></div><hr />

Quite posible a scam right now. With fake codes or stolen cards. I say dont risk it. As i know you cant sell code you can only gift it and if you sell it for a ingame gold it is against tos. Card mounts are exeption because you unlock them on your accaunt and you can sell them like items.<br />

There's a difference between a &quot;Cool&quot; mount and an option to play with friends. Buying this mount won't give you any advantage what so ever, it's just for the looks and bragging. A feature that lets you do Cross-realm LFD's should be free, since this is part of the game.

Here is where it stops me though. I realized that I would be handing over 25 bucks and getting nothing in return that would be mine. We pay to Rent this game, and Im already doing my 15/month for that. It just seems a bit crazy to spend another 25 on adding something else to the renting package. It use an awesome mount, and if you choose to get it that is your choice. It's just does not seem worth it to me since I wont own anything more and while cool its enjoyment factor is not the same as a game.</div></div><hr />

Well, no, actually the mount looks pretty alright, and it truly is a shame they used it like this. And I'm not even saying that because it will be common, its more of how I'd rather want it to be a cool reward for doing something challenging, and clicking a few buttons at a website is not that. <br />
<br />
Also, its like 8 liters of beer.</div></div><hr />

What I said earlier is what's happening, deny that people are bitching about something nice costing money and you'll actually feel your IQ drop relative to the idiocy of your previous thought. It happened with the Celestial Steed, it's happening here.<br />

Really, I don't see the negativity in this mount or the means to acquire it at all. But here I go again, questioning why you don't think like me right? ;) If you dont like the way I think or post you're perfectly welcome to simply ignore me.

So if I wanted this mount I have to pay $15 a month and $25 to obtain it? No thanks, that's not deserved of my money. Blizzard is the best game creation company out there but they're greedy as fuck.

If nobody would buy this mount, that would send a message that we're not going to pay extra for stuff we should get for paying $15 a month and we'd get shit like this for having an active subscription. Notice how we didn't get a pet for WoW's last Anniversary? Blizzard said &quot;Fuck that, if they want something extra special they're going to have to pay for it.&quot; And you people do so they're going to keep doing it.

$15 gets you access to the servers and your characters for as long as Blizzard keeps collecting your money, that's it. Nothing else is promised or implied. Don't believe me? Its in the EULA/ToS. Trying to say you &quot;deserve&quot; more than that just makes you sound like a whiny little kid with an overblown sense of entitlement. If you think its worth the money, pay for it.

Totally agree. Transactional investment shouldn't take the place of in-game transformational investment (y'know, 'effort'.) Yes, it's just a vanity item. But so is every other mount you collect in-game. Through effort. Maybe you can have an achievement with this for free... &quot;The Sucker: Allowed vanity to make you bend over and swipe credit card through buttcrack, 31/05/11&quot;.

$15 gets you access to the servers and your characters for as long as Blizzard keeps collecting your money, that's it. Nothing else is promised or implied. Don't believe me? Its in the EULA/ToS. Trying to say you &quot;deserve&quot; more than that just makes you sound like a whiny little kid with an overblown sense of entitlement. If you think its worth the money, pay for it. If you don't think it's worth the money, then don't.<br />
<br />
If it's not going to be included with my subscription then that's fine with me, the game obviously doesn't need it.<br />
<br />
I'm just giving you my opinion, there was no reason to throw out insults. I believe you that what you said is in the TOS, again, I was stating my opinion that if we pay $15 to play a game then I think we deserve everything Blizzard releases for said game. This is a message board that is designed for people to state opinions but as soon as an opinion doesn't match yours, the name calling starts. Funny that I'm being called a whiny kid by someone who started with personal attacks.</div></div><hr />

Also, are people just cheap or poor? 25 dollars/17pounds/20 euroes isn't much :s<br />
<br />
Are you kidding me. for that amount of money i could get a BJ. and i would have more enjoyment out of it than flying around on a stone lion with lightnigh shooting out of his arse.</div></div><hr />

Governments must fight about who gets to have you as a beloved citizen. You're failing at making a useful, thought out point in a discussion here. Instead you're just trying to insult me by trying to fit me into a negative stereotype and putting words into my mouth that, I can honestly tell you, would never even cross my mind. Please try again, I would love to see something worth thinking about.<br />

<br />
&quot;Go mindless sheep, go and throw your money at AB so they can use a little of it to create new, exciting premium content that you have to pay extra for. Again. I love people. No seriously, I hate most of 'em.&quot;<br />

You just pwned yourself hardcore, a guy that bought a WoW mount could be the most not normal guy in the world, how would you know? If you buy something because you like it and want it then that is not being a sheep, buying an Iphone because everyone else has it and you actually don't need it = sheep.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz needs to stop giving us &quot;premium&quot; and &quot;optional&quot; shit to buy and focus more on important things...like designing gear that isn't ugly or giving us a new heroic to work on in the long interims between raids being released. Not my problem that they screwed the new content up so bad, lost like over a million players and need to try and make up for it somehow. I'd rather have $5/month added to my subscription fee for some sweet new in-game options than being tossed a VERY unattractive bone.<br />
<br />
The mounts and pets you can buy shouldn't count toward achievements for collecting them.<br />
<br />
To all of the &quot;I'm-so-much-better-than-you&quot; fucks out there who think that ppl are complaining about it coz &quot;they're too poor&quot; (better spelled &quot;there to poor!&quot; coz you're most likely just an idiot, yourself) - get bent. Honestly. For some people, that extra $25 can be like a few meals or gas money, whatever. Also, just because we DON'T WANT IT doesn't mean we can't afford it. Unsaddle yourselves from your high horses, you haven't earned your seat.</div></div><hr />

now you only need a life outside of WoW and some friends and a girl that loves you...and you could really call yourself lucky.<br />
but hey, until then you got a freaking dumb mount just like tenthousand of other dumb people...</div></div><hr />
