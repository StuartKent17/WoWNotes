Worldwide Arena Battle on TTR<br />
A Worldwide Arena Battle will be held on Tournament Test Realm on Sunday between 12PM and 3PM PST.<br />
Are you ready to take on the world in the arenas? The World of Warcraft team will be testing the WoW Arena Tournament on the Tournament Test Realm, and you are invited to be a part of the action. Players in all regions will access the same realm, so the call is going out to all PvPers in North America, Europe, and Korea to log into the Arena Tournament Test Realm and participate in all-out PvP action!<br />
<br />
The Worldwide Arena Battle will take place this Sunday between 12PM to 3PM PST, and members of the Community and Development teams will join in the fray, including a head to head match between community managers from around the world for world dominance. The results will also be posted on the Tournament forum!<br />
<br />
No character copies will be needed for this unique event as you will get access to the character and gear of your choice just by logging in. The 2.4 PTR patch will provide access to the Tournament realm so download it soon and weâ€™ll see you on the battlefield!<br />
<br />
If you didn't install your PTR client yet, you can download it through the Blizzard download (from the Test Realm page on the official site) or just use the following temporary mirrors.<br />
<br />
PTR Client mirrors<br />
This is the original file to install the PTR client, then run the WoW.exe in your WoWTest folder to get all the PTR updates (there are a few of them, probably 6 or 7, and you'll have to install them one by one) <br />

Warlocks and mages changes in the expansion<br />
Warlocks will get a few new abilities in the expansion, Kalgan posted about one of them on the forums. Keep in mind that it's just an idea and it could perfectly not be included in the final version of the expansion.<br />
We definitely feel the need for warlocks to gain some sort of active defense so we don't have to try to balance them around the assumption that they're &quot;tanking&quot; melee classes. For example, an idea we're running with internally is the concept of a warlock being able to cast a spell that places a circle of demonic power on the ground. The warlock would be able to teleport to this location from within a relatively short range (ie: 40 yards), and would also be able to summon demons more quickly if they're standing within the circle.<br />
<br />
Note: this idea is intended as a sneak peek, it's not something that we're planning for 2.4, it would be more likely as an expansion ability, and may change entirely before said time. <br />
<br />
Mages will also get a few nice things, especially when it comes to warlocks/mages balancing in PvP.<br />
Mages will get new abilities in the expansion too, believe it or not. In fact, we intend to tone down how strong of a counter warlocks are to mages through the wotlk spells/talents.<br />
<br />
<br />
WotLK - Lake Wintergrasp popularity<br />
If you've been asking yourself if Lake Wintergrasp (the expansion outdoor PvP zone) will be popular or not, it seems that Blizzard is fairly confident about its future success.<br />
Based on the information we already know, I think it will be more active than Halaa because one of the things that hurt Halaa was the Diminishing Returns on honor points. With this removed in patch 2.4 people will be able to continue piling up honor points until they've had enough. I know rewards play a huge factor, so with the knowledge that people have now of items we've made available through honor points, I think it will continue to be a busy place for a long time.<br />

US Realms - Central US Internet issues<br />
If you've been high latency and unusual things on US realms, you might want to watch updates on this thread. <br />
A network degradation outside of the Blizzard network is currently impacting several World of Warcraft realms. Players attempting to access the impacted realms may be experiencing high network latency, packet loss, disconnections or inability to connect. We are actively receiving updates from the parties involved and have been assured that the issue is actively being worked on; however, we have not yet received any estimates for when a resolution may occur. We will continue to provide updates as we receive further information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unneeded.. meh. With a buff like that its prolly gonna mean warlocks will be nerfed in stamina or something like that. Atm we have the most stamina of all classes in pvp. This is like Kalgan said warlocks are sorta the melee tank caster, since warlocks can't really do much vs melee. Now I am not so sure how this new spell would help warlocks that much tho, with crippeling or hamstring you are still majorly screwed. Intercept, sprint and they are back on you. And I doubt its gonna be on a short cooldown like blink, or they might just make it cost a shard.. :-\</div></div><hr />

Ugh, don't mention shards. The concept of soul shards as a reagent is stupid. It's not a purchasable reagent, which would be fine if it was stackable, but it isn't, and sure, 'locks can use up a bag slot to hold a bunch of them, but the soul bags don't give a quiver-like buff, and it's it's still really easy to run out of shards, especially in PvP.<br />

And the circle has closed... rogues get shs for mobility , then the other classes get the same mobility and rogues will be needing more again in order to be able to get to their target.</div></div><hr />

Read again, goober... Kalgan said that they were thinking about giving them this spell so that the developers no longer have to rely on Warlocks having a ton of stamina for survivability.<br />
<br />
So in other words, the lock's tradeoff for this spell will be less stamina.</div></div><hr />

Was I the only person who didnt read that? Youre responding to the other suppositions in the thread and not what Kalgan actually said. They are trying to get away from balancing locks around drain tanking. Sounds like a bit of a class overhaul to me. I don't mean to be a nonce, as this may include a massive Stam reduction but that isn't mentioned in the blue post. No need for name calling.</div></div><hr />

it kinda reminds me of the old Shadow Step spell that necro's had in EQ, only instead of random to a static spot required for certain spells/abilities. could be interesting, but seriously, INC PVP QQ!</div></div><hr />

&quot;melee seem to be doing too well against warlocks drain-tank-killing them...so we're thinking about giving warlocks a form of teleport.&quot; ok.. Don't bullshit me either, i've seen plenty of warriors die to warlocks drain tanking because pummel is on CD.<br />
<br />
majority of mages are going to flame this idea mainly because warlocks are (potentially) getting our class defining defensive spell...more so, the version of the spell from Beta that was deemed OP and changed to its current form. all the while, we've been asking to have it changed back because its bugged as hell.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps, like a tradeoff for some more defensive capabilities. I'd be careful with that though - their changes to shamans (which were reverted) make me honestly wonder about how they balance classes. You warlocks better be careful what you wish for, they might take away your STA and stick an MS debuff on Soulfire and call it even :P What I find hilarious is that they were just trying to nerf warlocks, but due to the massive rivers of tears overflowing the warlock community, it was reverted. Well, okay, we can live with that. But let's just take a look again at what a BLUE posted. As a reminder, 100% is supposed to be the &quot;expected amount&quot;. I omitted the healing classes for ease of reading and because their &quot;problems&quot; seem to lie with the original DPS classes.<br />
2200+ rating:<br />
2v2 3v3 5v5<br />
Hunter 43.0% 50.2% 43.0%<br />
Mage 8.7% 96.0% 96.0%<br />
Rogue 144.2% 175.1% 61.8%<br />
Warlock 149.2% 93.2% 111.9%<br />
Warrior 130.4% 90.7% 79.3%<br />
<br />
1850 rating:<br />
Hunter 50.2% 50.2% 50.2%<br />
Mage 61.1% 87.3% 87.3%<br />
Rogue 154.5% 154.5% 82.4%<br />
Warlock 121.2% 102.5% 102.5%<br />
Warrior 90.7% 85.0% 85.0%<br />
<br />
In every single category in 1850, Warlocks are above 100% representation. In 2200+, they are above 100% representation in 2v2 and 5v5, with a 93% representation in 3v3. Not bad. Okay so, let's compare... Warlocks are represented more than Hunters straight out across the board. They are represented more than warriors in every single category in both rating brackets (the class that is supposedly causing them so many problems that the warlock class needs an &quot;overhaul&quot;). Rogues are better represented than warlocks in all of the categories except for 5v5. Alright, this is the supposed &quot;warlock counter&quot; class. There is one, according to those numbers. That seems reasonable. I understand that it can be &quot;hard to play a warlock&quot; with things beating on you, but from what I've been shown, apparently there are ways to overcome that, and people have taken advantage of them. The last time my Battlegroup's 2v2 Ladder was accurate (some teams are being held by single players with 1500 p. rating these days), warlock/druid dominated the top 10 spots: they were 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 7th. Only one Warrior/druid team managed to beat them all out for 1st. The other warrior/druid teams took 8th and 9th. Sorry for the long post, but it baffles me why Blizzard goes to the trouble to compile those statistics when they don't even take them into consideration.</div></div><hr />

It's not about classes being represented or not. This isn't a buff so to speak. It just gives warlocks a means to create some distance between them and the melee enemy. You obviously haven't played a warlock, otherwise you would know what this is about. This ability, if implemented, addresses one of the core issues of a class heavily based on a CC that has been nerfed to oblivion: Fear. The whole class is balanced based on the assumption that the warlock's target is CC'd a good chunk of the fight. But as you probably know Fear has been pretty much nerfed every single patch. Also, all classes that give warlocks trouble already have very good Fear protection (warriors, rogues and hunters). Add to that a plethora of items and abilities that break Fear and you have a very broken class...<br />
<br />
Currently for a warlock to be effective in higher brackets they have to spec SL/SL. Again, if you have played a warlock you would know it's one of the most boring and repetitive playstyles of any class/spec, which also doesn't necessarily take the highest skill. Personally, I quit PvPing on my warlock (which used to be my PvP main) because I didn't enjoy the 'DoT n' Drain' routines. I think it's pointless and boring. All Blizzard is doing is addressing this issue. If you want to count this as a 'buff' you can be sure they're going to 'nerf' warlocks by cutting back on their stamina or damage, or possibly even their damage mitigation. The whole point of this change is so that warlocks won't have to stack 14k hp to be even relevant.</div></div><hr />

Sure, those SL-SL noobs are overpowered, I fully give you that. But any, and I mean ANY, other build that it is raid-able with (I would kick every SL-SL lock from my raid instantly b/c I assume they do not have skill at all) leaves you like a sitting duck to all melee classes. <br />
<br />
I'm mainly a PvE fan but do PvP at times to have something else to spend my time on. And believe me, whenever I hear that 'cluck' sound of a rogue stunning me, i can go afk, because he will keep me stunned for 80% of my 12k life (with around 200 resil) and then take down my remaining 20% while having cloak of lol on.<br />
<br />
With a warri it is better because it doesn't take as long. but more or less with the same effect. Charge-stun-deathcoil-charge-stun-insane white dmg (even non-crits). I'm dead.<br />
<br />
Everybody hates locks because there is ONE out of the 5, 6 or 7 possible builds that is overpowered and all the noobs are using it.<br />

Apologies that this update is coming so late but we pulled the Essence of Immortal quest chain about 2 weeks ago. That's why you haven't seen it on the Public Test Realm. The 3 gates will open automatically over time at equal intervals on all servers.<br />
<br />
Regarding the taking back of the town on the Isle, however, that will still be dependent on completion of daily quests. Servers can race to see who can open their quest hub the fastest. But access to raid bosses has been made equal.<br />
<br />
We really like the concept of cross-server competition. But the concept of the gates being tied to specific boss kills was not playing out as we had hoped. We plan to do future things that involve servers competing with one another through major events.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I know sorely how bad fear has been nerfed - my main is a priest. I am saying all of these things with the mindset that fear is cast once every 30 seconds (trust me, I've had my share of fun experiences - to do 5v5 and get 3 &quot;immune&quot; messages and 1 resist in a single spell... WotF is a nightmare sometimes!) :D My fear is once every 30 seconds, 26 with talents. That is my one fear. Complaining about having to be one spec is 100% selfish and pointless - all priests must be disc to be &quot;good&quot;, all warriors must be MS, all mages must be frost. Almost EVERY class has to deal with that &quot;one boring spec&quot; that is repetitive in order to compete seriously. Until they change that for EVERY class, it's not unfair for one class to join the rest on that boat. Also, you omitted the first part of my quote where I said &quot;Warlocks need a buff. HA. A change? Perhaps, like a tradeoff for some more defensive capabilities.&quot; :) .</div></div><hr />

<br />
A fire mage is all but a free kill to a SS rogue/warrior, although a frost is more balanced and still has a (not so big) upperhand against warriors... You see, the other side of the thing is that melee also have many ways of closing the distance. Personally I think locks could use some avoidance/getaway kind of skill regarding melee units.<br />

Have u ever tried warrior vs warlock?!?!? Bcaus im seriously doubting that. The dots will tick, drain life will tick but as much as u interupt it and MS us, we mostly die first. If a warrior got a bit of skills this must be a reasonable good fight u have a fair chance to win.<br />

For example, an idea we're running with internally is the concept of a warlock being able to cast a spell that places a circle of demonic power on the ground. The warlock would be able to teleport to this location from within a relatively short range (ie: 40 yards), and would also be able to summon demons more quickly if they're standing within the circle.<br />

Not to jump the gun since it's planned for wotlk but..<br />

We definitely feel the need for warlocks to gain some sort of active defense so we don't have to try to balance them around the assumption that they're &quot;tanking&quot; melee classes.<br />
<br />
That says Soul Link removed. The part about the 'blink' is a 31 point loldemo replacement POS all-viewable 2-3 second summoned but instant castable portal.<br />
<br />
What he'll accomplish in this 'buff' is to make warlock into a mage without ice block, shields, etcetera. Mark me on that, and see.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On the other hand they need a huge nerf versus casters, namely mages.<br />
<br />
Rogues need a nerf, namely against locks then. It's called a counter class you're supposed to be destroyed by them. Mage used to do that to Warriors until Kalgan got his hands on them and buffed them into insanity.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd love to see all classes on the same scale of skill (*cough* LOL) &gt; class like that, but I highly doubt with his buttbuddy playing Rogue you'll see that class get the same balance to Lock as Warrior did to Mage, or Mage will to Lock.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In every single category in 1850, Warlocks are above 100% representation. In 2200+, they are above 100% representation in 2v2 and 5v5, with a 93% representation in 3v3. Not bad.<br />
<br />
TBH I wouldn't be quoting Kalgan's 'representation' numbers as gospel, the figures are easily questionable, and likely bent to using Warrior class as an axis point given their sum representation sits right at 100%. Probability says that shouldn't happen. Kalganism says it will because they don't need nerfing (while he's still playing it).</div></div><hr />

Seriously. If some1 announce the warlock debuffs, its Kalgan becaus he cant stand warlocks. He yust reversed the lifetap nerf bcaus he was seriously getting baaaaad feedback.<br />

Kalgan normaly gets the locks nerferd since he is a warrior. And what ur whining about the new spell. Its WotLK!!! All classes get new skills, so this is yust a preview wich might not even get implemented.

Rofl, I just registered to tell you what a nub you are. <br />
<br />
<br />
For others that don't get why ppl fear news like this is because you don't give locks current cc enough credit. Fear gives them all kinds of free attacks while you can do nothing. Its essentially like a rogue cheep shot and you never get a counter off. Difference is the lock can drain life/mana while he put distance between you and himself. <br />
<br />
Not to mention HS, high end dps, and pets. Talk about hax.<br />
<br />
I see other range classes having to work to keep rogues and warriors away through kiting then I look over and see a lock standing in one place fearing ppl away while DoTing. I see no reason for any lock cc buffs.<br />
<br />
So now you think something similar to blink is the kind of buff they need? That sets up a whole new rotation of fears. If your angry because rogues beat you, think about priests and how screwed they are. Go pvp a shadow priest, I dare ya.</div></div><hr />

For others that don't get why ppl fear news like this is because you don't give locks current cc enough credit. Fear gives them all kinds of free attacks while you can do nothing. Its essentially like a rogue cheep shot and you never get a counter off. Difference is the lock can drain life/mana while he gets distance on you. <br />
<br />
Not to mention HS, high end dps, and pets. Talk about hax.<br />
<br />
I see other range classes having to work to keep rogues and warriors away through kiting then I look over and see a lock standing in one place fearing ppl away while DoTing. I see no reason for any lock cc buffs.<br />
<br />
So now you think something similar to blink is the kind of buff they need? That sets up a whole new rotation of fears. If your angry because rogues beat you, think about priests and how screwed they are. Go pvp a shadow priest, I dare ya.<br />

<br />
When a lock is left alone he is devastating at 100% locking someone down. i.e. a warlock can chain fear a palladin till immune, then deathcoil, then spelllock, then finish off with curse of tongues while the rest off the dots kill the palladin. Then start the fear process over again. Its a no brainer 100% lockdown.<br />
<br />
I play a lock and i will wholeheartedly agree i can do this to palladins. (and a few other classes, druids (not resto), mages for example)<br />
<br />
Now heres the flip side. While ive locked down the palladin and killed him in 10-15 seconds (or longer), a rogue or hunter will come up to me and kill me in 3 seconds. Sometimes 2. I am 485 resilience and soul linked, and yes rogues and hunters can do this to me.<br />
<br />
If i try to cast fear as a defensice mechanism the spell pushback is so great it can take 10 or even more seconds to fully cast. And ofc this is more than enough time to have my shadow spells locked out.<br />
<br />
Warlocks need an escape mechanism when they are being focus fired. Its another no brainer. Any class with no defence is useless, and it simply isnt fair being killed in 2 or 3 seconds with nothing you can do about it.<br />
<br />
Warlocks need BALANCING.<br />
<br />
This means an escape mechanism from insane dps'ing rogues hunters (and alot of times warriors).<br />
This also means taking away the ability to 100% lockdown another class by the use of chain fears, spell locks, deathcoils.<br />
<br />
I would happily trade my stamina (currently my ONLY form of defence when im being focus fired), for a skill that allows me a fair escape mechanism.<br />
<br />
This is the sole reason why locks are very strong in 2v2 and 3v3, but quite weaker (generall speaking, i know there are some imbah locks) in 5v5.<br />
<br />
edit - if any blizz dev's read this aswell, no lock likes playing sl/sl, its friggin boring. and no sane lock will spec anything else coz all other specs are like wearing paper for armour. If you gave locks self banish (like has been mentioned a million times, an escape mechanism (like this new version of blink idea)) and some better spell pushback resistance, a way to pretect fel aroumr from being dispalled so easily, and pet scaling so that the pets have a % of the masters resilience, and NERFED soul link to 10 or 15% dmg mitigation, you wouldnt have so many unhappy locks forced to spec sl/sl and you wouldnt have so many pissed off players thinking they cant kill a lock and/or fed up of being chain feared to death. (make fear work like blind btw, instant cast, mob runs around for 5-10 yards MAX, but it breaks on ANY damage). And you wil get alot more happy customers .</div></div><hr />

This is the most retarded thing to say, ever. So you have 1 spec that's good in PvP, so what? Do you hear protection warriors moan they suck in arena? Or fury warriors for that matter? No, cause they do their dailies, and respec for PvP. So don't give me bullshit like: warlocks need 1 spec for both PvE and PvP, that would be the most OP thing ever...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Giving a lock blink or a self banish similar to the way ice block works for mages will open up a chain of ability abuse.<br />
<br />
I can see locks doting up everything they got then self banashing while their target stands and dies. Mean while their fears are cooling for a fresh rotation when they come out of banashment. <br />
<br />
Or a lock blinking and opening up a whole new free rotation of fears. Results in even more lock down for other classes.<br />
<br />
You can't tell me you wouldn't do either if you had those abilitys just to win.</div></div><hr />

No escape mechanism? Deathcoil and fear maybe? Warrior attacking you? Dot him and keep drainlifing till he die. With SL he CANT kill you until you kill him (unless you suck badly)<br />
<br />
Your pvp build is boring? Warriors has one pvp build with MS, do they QQ here that its boring?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dsswoosh</div><div class="date">2008-03-12, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As i said, locks need balancing.<br />
<br />
No more, no less.<br />
<br />
The combination of chain fearing, spell lock, curse of tongues, deathcoil in certain situations is overpowered.<br />
And mellee (rogues, hunters and warriors) training on locks is gives a lock 0% chance of winning.<br />
<br />
For example all a bm hunter has to do to beat a lock is cast the beast within, arcane shot and auto shot. If hes feeling particularly evil he can lay a snake trap. There is ZERO a lock can do.<br />
<br />
I agree with the concerns of abuse. Dot dot dot, blink may be overpowered. But there is no denying, that in the current build of wow, locks are human punchbags for mellee with zero they can do to escape apart from stack stam (which causes many people pulling their hair out (ie mages) because they simply dont have the burst to eat through all the hp))<br />
<br />
And no, to the person above me, locks cant drain tank warriors at all anymore, mortal strike is just too great for the lock to get any decent hp back in many situations. (im talking arena, not 1v1, which yes warriors suck very badly at)<br />
<br />
People need to have an understanding, that locks are forced into the sl/sl spec. Nerfing the spec even more has damagin affects to other lock pvp builds and all it does is force more and more locks to spec this way.<br />
<br />
If the other trees (particulalry destro) had a blink like ability, it would encourage locks away from the godforsaken sl/sl build, and rather than stacking stam and relying on chain fearing, locks would actually be able to do seomthing else.<br />
<br />
The problem is becuae people who dont play locks are pulling their hair out at trying to eat through a locks stamina are the same people who cry &quot;locks need nerf&quot;, and &quot;omfg, soul link is friggin op&quot;, and they simply do not understand that the other trees for lock pvp need a buff in order to get sl/sl locks playing another spec.<br />
<br />
But when people like me try to explain &quot;locks need a buff in other trees&quot; or &quot;locks need an escape ability&quot;, all the people that dont play lock just reply &quot;omfg, no way do locks need a buff&quot; or &quot;omfg you cant beat a warrior, all you need to do is draintank, l2p noob&quot;.<br />
<br />
Its kind of frustrating, because most locks are asking for a &quot;fix&quot; or a balance, which does indeed meaning buffing destro or affliction, and possibly nerfing sl/sl.<br />
<br />
To back up what i am saying, i will use season 1 as a prime example. Unstable affliction was a very good spec in season 1. And there was also some very skilled locks (drakedog) being able to do well with destruction. Throughout all of season 1 people cried very badly locks needed a nerf, and while in many cases this may have been true (ie the season 1 sl/sl locks), locks did in deed get nerfed. this affected destruction and affliction to such an extent that come season 3 and into season 4, nearly all locks are now sl/sl. Do you see whats happened, all the lock nerfs have forced people into this spec.<br />
<br />
Teh 41 point talent shadowfury is a 100% pvp lock talent. How many destro locks do you see? My guess would be less than 1%. Why is this? Because the enrfs made to locks have simply meant that it isnt a viable season 3 or season 4 spec for 99% of warlocks (your always going to ge the odd one or two super human skilled korean players able to pull it off).<br />
<br />
Cries of &quot;nerf lock&quot; has simply put locks in a corner of 1 boring (still overpowered in many cases) spec, and the same people are still pulling theeir hair out thinking locks are overpowered.<br />
<br />
Give destro locks and affliction locks more options for pvp specs (which yes does involve giving locks buffs), and youll start to see the sl/sl spec not being used as much, and this can only be a win / win situation for everybody.<br />
<br />
And i shall repeat, FEAR is NOT an escape ability. It is either used offensively, or as an interupt. There is absolutley NO way a lock can pull a fear off with a mellee on him. Deathcoil IS an escape ability, but its a 2 minute cd and affects ONE target. Many classes have at least one way to escape an absolute focus fire rapeing. Locks do not. And this makes them the &quot;human punchbags&quot; of the game, leaving locks only one option. Stack resilience, stamina, spec sl/sl, dot everything up, then bend over and take the beating and hope your gear allows you to live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
without critiquing your entire post, 1 tick of hellfire owns snakes. incase you didn't realize it their health was greatly greatly nerfed a while back.<br />
<br />
also sl/sl is the most popular spec because people know how to play it. UA is viable in 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 with the right combo. spriest and druid come to mind in 2v2. as does paladin. 3v3 spriest and ele sham is deadly. 5s is a bit more open. however you must have 500 or more resil and tons of stam to make it viable, but it is viable. <br />
<br />
ua/druid is great, cyclone one while you completely dot up the other, or time up a UA with a cyclone coming off CD and dot up something else.</div></div><hr />

and scrolling down i see some UA specs. i never said it was the most popular, i said it was viable, as in it is possible. and looking at that it is. <br />
<br />
do you really not have answers to my other questions?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
Maybe your referring to the UA specs, which arent their pvp spec and are in fact their raid spec? I didnt see you write any other questions tbh, only how hellfire can kill snakes.......(which in fact its hihgly unlike to prduce even one tick when a hunters pet, a hunters auto attack, and yes, snakes produce an insane amount of spell pushback, meaning one tick of hellfire is not likley to happen).<br />
<br />
You also used the word &quot;popular&quot;. In the case of pvp specs, &quot;popular&quot; will be the spec that offers most survival and produces the most wins.<br />
<br />
It really doesnt take a genius to see that locks spec sl/sl because this is the spec that offers the most survial. this wouldnt be a problem in the slightest, would it be for the fact that many people hate facing sl/sl locks and whine so much about them, not to mention most locks hate using it themselves.<br />
<br />
My point is this. People wanted to see locks get nerfed, and locks did get nerfed. Now im not moaning about this in any way shape or form, because some of the changes were more than justified. All im saying is the nerfs and changes made to locks have forced locks into one pvp spec. And i repeat this wouldnt be a problem, except for the fact it isnt fun for people who face locks, neitehr is it fun for locks themselves.<br />
<br />
Therefore i have merely repeated what has been said by many in the lock forums.<br />
<br />
Buff locks in the are they need buffing (defence from mellee), and nerf locks where they need nerfing (insane stamina, insane damage mitigation, insane crowd control abilites in a given situation).<br />
<br />
I really dont see why people have to argue with me, when all im asking is to balance locks. Its not like im saying &quot;zomg i cant win locks need buff&quot;, im merely saying &quot;locks are op in certain situations, and they suffer greatly in other situations, could something please be balanced?&quot;<br />
<br />
Where is the problem in asking for balance?</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but every class looses to another. You get locked down and loose to rogues just like hunters and priests thatâ€™s just how it works. If you catch a rogue via flare felhunter whatever you have the upper hand. Be aware of your surroundings instead of asking for a hand out. <br />
<br />
Itâ€™s funny how blizzard announces ideas of an ability that no one expects or even asks for then suddenly everyone that itâ€™s in favor of starts fabricating reasons why they need it. Locks are in no way hurting nore are hunters yet they fall subject to the same weaknesses. So you think hunters need aoe fear? Of course not, its their weakness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And thats exactly why locks are getting buffed against mellee, and mages are getting buffed against locks. to prevent classes having an upper hand against ceratin other classes.<br />
<br />
In case you hadnt noticwed, this is what blizz is currently working on. Class balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Then they have much work to do to other classes because locks are in no way hurting. In the end if all classes have no weakness you haven't gotten anywere. Just means you wont own anyone else and the rogue wont own you. Instead of having a upper hand based on class and abilitys it will now take more effort to kill anyone, meaning your still gona get owned if you suck. <br />
<br />
halo is a perfect example of you're vision of wow. <br />
popular, obsessive, fair down to the T and impossible to beat people that have no life. And those same kind of people exist in wow.<br />
<br />
I play wow because its wow. If I want to play halo I play halo.</div></div><hr />
