Mythic Helya Kill - Ðanish Terrace<br />
Ðanish Terrace (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/sylvanas/%C3%90anish+Terrace) got a world third kill on Mythic Helya today, with an interesting strategy.<br />

<br />
Another illustration of &quot;it's hard to find limit between clever use and exploit&quot; <br />
She's breathing, damaging tanks with it, spawning adds. Similar to putting p3 Cho'gall on the throne in BoT. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/802678963474530304))<br />
Obviously not the strat the encounter's designer intended, but no part of that is a &quot;bug.&quot; (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/802679088360013824))<br />
<br />
Thanks for answering. If Helya kept breathing and we suicided 1 tank on each breath would we got banned ?<br />
I'm pretty sure you wouldn't have been, it's about her bugging out, not the suicide itself (IMO).<br />
Yeah. Target's death stopping one cast is consistent with many other abilities out there; it's how WoW works. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/802681072249028609))<br />
Target's death causing the boss to never cast again is a clear bug that removes a mechanic entirely. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/802681190876467200))<br />
It's the difference between Archimonde crystals and LK Saronite Bombs, basically. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/802681278822682624))<br />
<br />
Speaking of LK/Ensidia, basically you don't consider &quot;intent&quot; as a factor in deciding bans or is it case by case<br />
Case by case; intent can be hard to gauge, but there are clues. It's hard to read intent into a fluke free kill (e.g. M-Odyn). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/802682301008093184))<br />
But when a group is repeatedly performing an action that causes the fight to bug out, and building a strat around that bug... (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/802682504251510784))<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Demonology Warlock [Sin'dorei Spite] legendary bracers are bugged, buff not applying to Wild Imps. Any chance of a fix?<br />
Slated for a fix in 7.1.5 I believe; I'll see if that can be moved up at all. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/801496155448184832))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What are the biggest factors that stop great ideas right in their tracks? Specifically in game design and conceptual creation.<br />
In general, I advocate *not* trying to stop great ideas right in their tracks. Game designers in particular are so comfortable with analysis that they can immediately shift to pointing out why something won’t work instead of trying to figure out what to do so that it can work. In my work, I try to structure idea generation into two phases: a purely creative one where you don’t accept any constraints, and then a more pragmatic phase where you shift from asking “Is this cool?” to “Should we build it?”<br />
<br />
I don’t think that was really the spirit of your question though, so I’ll try to go a little deeper. Let’s assume the idea has gotten through the pure brainstorming phase and now you’re critically evaluating it. What would kill it?<br />
<br />
1) Technical realities. Programming time is expensive in terms of opportunity cost. In my experience, very few engineers will tell you no. Instead they’ll tell you how long something will take and what you may have to give up to get it. There are a limited number of programming hours in the day, so if you shift some of those hours to a new idea, you have to give up something else. Sometimes that’s the right call because the new idea is so awesome. But if every idea is awesome (in terms of shifting resources to pursue it) then nothing is. (This can happen with other resources as well. Art is probably the second most likely to bottle-neck an idea after programming.)<br />
<br />
2) Doesn’t fit the game. This actually comes up a lot, and it can be a tough thin to arbitrate because different developers on a team might have different opinions of what fits or not. I tend to spend a lot of time thinking about setting precedents because the games I have worked on have long lifespans. The developers today may be opening up something cool (or a Pandora’s box) that future developers are going to have to contend with. Think of relatively simple but hugely impactful decisions like “Should WoW allow third party mods?” The definition of “fit” here can encompass a lot of things, like whether it’s a feature players actually need, whether it matches thematically, and so on.<br />
<br />
3) Causes unintentional player behavior. You have to really think through this one because by definition it’s often hard to anticipate what the outcomes will be. Some outcomes are perfectly fine. I don’t mean to imply that every time players do something unexpected that it’s inherently bad. But you can also cause players do things that are really unfun. Imagine you give players a chance to get a reward once an hour. Are you encouraging them to set their alarms every hour while they try to sleep?<br />
<br />
4) Confusing or janky. Some great ideas are inelegant enough that they will cause a lot of confusion. It depends a lot on your game about how much of this you’ll tolerate. Sometimes the idea is worth the extra price in complication. But complication can have a real price as well – confused players might open support tickets, which are a real hit on a game’s bottom line. (Publishers generally want to offer player support because it helps make the experience good for players, but they also want to build the game in such a way that players don’t need to hit up player support constantly.) You could also argue that if the idea is too inelegant that maybe it doesn’t qualify as great.<br />
<br />
5) Collision with some upcoming feature. This is where project or team leads can really earn their salt, because they can provide a bigger picture that individual contributors may not have access to. “Hey I thought of a great idea to minimize our download time!” might be rendered less useful if you have the information to say “Great idea, but we’re working on continual streaming next milestone, so downloads are no longer a big player pain point.”<br />
<br />
There are a bunch of others, but those are the ones that came to mind.<br />

<br />
the strat was fixed to not bug out the boss so it's viable to do now. Also the raid has to use battle rezzes for each cast they want to skip, not just do it once to negate all casts. The difficulty is higher for the not bugged version of the strat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IF you avoid a whole mechanic permanently for the rest of a fight, as in helya never breathes again. thats exploit.<br />
<br />
If you avoid a mechanic, that tempoary doesn't breathe as in 1 time only. that is a counter cuz helya has nothing to breathe on, but she would breathe next time its off cd.<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway, even if we do not count DT as 3rd, they would be 5th , so it is still an amazing job.<br />
<br />
but since the 2 who downed it exploited, it will make DT 3rd. and Scrubbusters 4th.</div></div><hr />

P3 you'd sacc a tank to the crystal to spare the dps normally needed to kill it as well as the heals required to keep the tank up, however said strat needed CRs to work so any additional deaths could invalidate the tactic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they report on world third because it's been over a week and only 3 guilds have legitimately downed it without exploits, which is rather significant.<br />
<br />
And @ people saying these people exploited, as the devs explained, no, they did not. The deaths were done to ignore that -ONE- breath. That's countering the breath, no different than interrupting it, or a hunter feigning when targeted by a skill.<br />
<br />
The exploits the other guilds did that got them banned is killing a tank and making Helya -completely- stop using her breath for the -ENTIRE- fight, not just that single breath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suppose it may help them beat the enrage timer since no one has to move to kill slimes, but as long as you have at least two hunters they're pretty easy to kill anyway.<br />
<br />
I think the interesting part was the sacrificing of tanks to stop her from casting her breath ability in phase 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those who got banned, had one tank death to remove the whole breath mechanic from the fight's entire duration.<br />
<br />
This guild here, eliminated one single breath, with a tank death. The next breath still came, unlike in the attempts/kills of those who were banned.<br />
<br />
Banned Guilds: Used a mechanic that was not working as intended as an advantage, and have both had representatives openly admit they abused a known (if not documented) bug.<br />
<br />
Bug has been fixed now, so if a guild wants to burn through all their combat rezzes negating these breath phases, then all the power to them. But they have to do it each time, not once for the whole encounter (the actual bug that was exploited).<br />
<br />
Not a hard concept to understand</div></div><hr />

<br />
This guild here, eliminated one single breath, with a tank death. The next breath still came, unlike in the attempts/kills of those who were banned.<br />
As far as I understand this is only due to this kill being performed after the bug was fixed: this same strategy before the fix would have bugged the breath for them too and they would have received a ban just the same. This means the strategy Exorsus devised was actually perfectly valid and only the bug prevented them from effectively using it and maybe get a legit kill.<br />
<br />
They were in the wrong to go for the kill with the boss bugged, but as stated by Blizzard letting the tank die is nothing new as progression strategy and I'm pretty concerned that apparently nobody at Blizzard thought about testing it. This is what ultimately led to the release of an encounter which remained effectively bugged for days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exorsus cannot force helya to continue casting breath after sacrificing tank BECAUSE BLIZZ IS UNABLE TO FIX THE BUG EVEN WHEN THEY KNOW ABOUT THE BUG BEFORE MYTHICS MODE RELEASE.<br />
<br />
This is the exact strat all the &quot;CHEATERS&quot; are using , except they cannot execute this strat cause blizz is incompetent and unable to fix the encounter ( to allow helya to conitnue casting breath instead of getting bugged out) in a timely manner. shame on blizz</div></div><hr />

You usually don't hear about them unless they pop up in patch notes or what not, but there has been numerous times that a guild has had to redo their entire strat to kill a boss because of these. Then you have Exorsus and From Scratch that say fuck it, and kill it with the bug anyway.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been pretty consistent with their &quot;interesting use of game mechanics&quot; vs &quot;exploit&quot; view, people that say otherwise probably haven't been around long enough to see what guilds have done to get themselves suspended.</div></div><hr />

No they are extremely similar just not identical, like I said in both cases a guild exploited the mechanics to trivialise an encounter and cheese a kill on a boss they couldn't have beaten legitimately.<br />
<br />
The big issue here is Blizzard being so erratic with enforcing the rules, it's gotten to the point where guilds cannot afford to not use shortcuts they find because they know that if they don't other guilds will, and if it's one of the nine times out of ten where Blizzard don't care then that means losing rankings. Exorsus took a shortcut and got banned, DT took a shortcut and didn't, it in both cases it was exploiting the mechanics to do something not intended and neither guild could have gotten their kill without it making their fight much easier.</div></div><hr />

No, the issue is some raider that got banned is telling you that Blizzard is being erratic. You probably missed the blatant fact that they blame Blizzard for getting banned, which is something a kid does when they don't want to take responsibility.</div></div><hr />

Really, Blizz shouldn't have banned them for as long as they did. Remove the kill, remove the loot. Fix the bug and let them kill it using the same strat but requiring all their BRez abilities.</div></div><hr />

Report the bug and wait for it to be fixed or find a new strategy (Method and Serenity did it without bugging the encounter, didn't they?). Simple as that. Just because blizzard is (as you view it) incompetent doesn't mean you exploit the bug.</div></div><hr />

They knew about the bug before the encounter was released. The only impetus for them actually fixing it was multiple guilds getting the encounter down thanks to the bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But they COULD have STOPPED after they realised it was a bug. Based off what their admittance letters stated, they NOTICED this bug over a period of pulls. So this wasn't a case of it happening once by accident and them killing it on that attempt. If that had been the case I'd be right up there with you defending them. But this was a case of them IDENTIFYING the bug and then using it to their benefit.<br />
<br />
This makes it an exploit which they then EXPLOITED to get a kill. As for Blizzard knowing about the bug...is there any proof outside of word of mouth that Blizz knew about it beforehand. It's a pretty obscure bug to have a tank die DURING a cast (unless it's a channeled ability) rather than after/at the cast, and doesn't sound like one you'd typically encounter.</div></div><hr />

Or Blizz could have spent 5 minutes fixing the bug before releasing the tier. If it isn't on the known bug list and you know it's been reported by multiple people the only thing you can do is assume it's not a bug. Blizz screwed the pooch on this one.</div></div><hr />

Why be salty? He offers insight. Whether it be from a Blizzard/WoW standpoint or from a general gaming industry standpoint. It's great to hear about the inner workings of a business given by someone who's both in it and has had lengthy experience. It's great read for the curious and for the many would be developers/publishers we have as current gamers.</div></div><hr />

No, they are. The turn in is apparently a little buggy. I turned in on my main, and as I was headed out to do the same on an alt my husband made the same comment as you. No rep token for him. I went to turn in on my alt and I had the rep token choices, but when I looked at his monitor his alt indeed did not. I said I'd look it up on the forums or something and he closed the quest turn in window without completing, then re-opened it again and suddenly the rep token choices were back. So he missed out on his main, but closing and re-opening did the trick for subsequent characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's just something I have observed over the past decade of erratic/inconsistent enforcement of the rules. Which has come to a head with Helya due to guilds using two different exploits to achieve kills they couldn't have managed legitimately and Blizzard only banning the ones who used one of the exploits.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
It's no an exploit.<br />
<br />
Yes it is, it's exploiting the mechanics in a way not intended by the designers in order to trivialise a fight that you are not able to defeat legitimatly. It's the very definition of exploiting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They explicitly said &quot;Target's death stopping one cast is consistent with many other abilities out there; it's how WoW works.&quot; so if you only cancel 1 ability with a death until it comes off cooldown, it's not a bug.<br />
<br />
If the boss stops using the skill for the rest of the fight, then it's a bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This guild here, eliminated one single breath, with a tank death. The next breath still came, unlike in the attempts/kills of those who were banned.<br />
<br />
Banned Guilds: Used a mechanic that was not working as intended as an advantage, and have both had representatives openly admit they abused a known (if not documented) bug.<br />
<br />
Bug has been fixed now, so if a guild wants to burn through all their combat rezzes negating these breath phases, then all the power to them. But they have to do it each time, not once for the whole encounter (the actual bug that was exploited).<br />
<br />
Not a hard concept to understandAnother concept that's not hard to understand: DT had the ability to use the sacrifice strat, those guild that got banned did not. Because that strat bugged the breath. Hence why the question could be raised about the fairness of the race to the guilds involved in this ban.<br />

This. Exactly this. No matter the excuses: most reading people think it was just &quot;once&quot;. By far not the case. Those guilds even go on PTR and train hardcore - I would not be surprised if they knew it back then already.</div></div><hr />

The race is over since the world first, you know.<br />
<br />
2 guilds successfully killed Helya without having to abuse anything, but it seems that 3 guilds didn't have the skills required for that so they decided to take a shortcut. I don't see any problem with that.</div></div><hr />

You mean &quot;I've just jumped on the bandwagon of hating all those who exploit and try to compare it to real life actual cheating&quot;. Please stop making out like it affects you so greatly.
