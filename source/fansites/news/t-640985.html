The official patch notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/8136495630-310-ptr-patch-notes.html) have been updated once again with more changes! Below are the latest additions.<br />

<br />

Taunts: All player or pet-generated taunts now have a shared diminish category.

But resilience number isnt the issue I was referring to, good players like disc priests stack around 1k resilience, and 400 is 10.9% off crit damage, so that is like maybe 25ish% off crits, math isnt the issue here. I just started getting gear this week really, so sue me, I'll have more resilience in another week. But the point was, with 11% less damage from crits, 48% less damage for his physical attacks mitigated by my armor (I dunno how much armor ignore he had), and 6% less damage taken due to improved righteous fury, for him to still have crit me for 7.8k is ridiculous! Also, I'm pretty doubtful as to my arena knowledge, but does resilience maintain itself the more you get? Meaning if I had 2k resilience (theoretically speaking), would I have 55%ish off crit damage? Since 400 is 11% or so and 400 x 5 = 2k, so 11% x 5 = 55%. Or does resilience dwindle like haste rating does atm?</div></div><hr />

<br />
because killing mages as feral is sooo hard...<br />
<br />
<br />
Open with Rake-&gt;Maim-&gt;Mangle-&gt;Shred. Ice block = restealth or powershift out of snares/roots if he breaks right away and tries to run. Running at +50% movement speed + Powershift out of slows isn't that hard to catch a mage unless he blinks.<br />
<br />
Blink? BEAR charge for the 4 second root. Switch to caster and cast roots, you get CS'ed of course. Back to bear and bash, root when the CS wears off. Resume DPS, using maim as a root. Really not that hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, rake does almost as much damage as pounce, takes less time to do it, costs less so you can get more attacks in before block or blink...try it sometime. It works out a lot better than pounce or ravage. Ravage sucks against mages, you need a bleed up for your shreds to max damage (bleeding/stunned/mangle shred does more damage than ravage, and for less energy...)<br />
<br />
Oh, and rake can crit for 2 CP maim (4 seconds incap atm) allowing more time for your opener. Pounce is simply a 4 second stun that will get blinked out of. <br />
<br />
3.1 I'd probably use pounce since they can blink out of maim. Fight will change a little, but feral with opener should always have the upper hand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An undergeared ret paladin...yeah that is going to eat a big crit. You expect you will not take a big crit b/c you're in plate? After FFF an undergeared pally is going to have maybe 40% DR from armor, 10% from your resil. If the guy has grim toll proc up your armor is going to be more like 30% reduction. You also neglect to mention if he had BG berserking buff or not, that would easily tip the scales. FB damage is and will be fine, getting a reliable crit in with it was one of the only things that made it useful. Honestly that talent should just be reworked from the ground up.</div></div><hr />

Night of the Dead: Redesigned to grant a flat reduction on cooldown to Raise Dead and Army of the Dead instead of a reduction from using abilities. Requires at least 15 points in the Unholy tree; prerequisite for Master of Ghouls.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not too pleased about this. I've played as unholy dps since i first made my DK, and i have never put talent points into NotD. Adding a prerequisite to Master of Ghouls is fine in my opinion, the spec i had looked at for 3.1 before this change had a talent point in runic power mastery just because i didn't need it anywhere else. Now i'll be 1 short. This change looks like its purpose is to keep blood and frost DKs from getting Master of Ghouls, i don't see why it also has to force unholy DKs to take a talent they may not have before. I know 1 point isn't a huge deal, but its just inconvenient and unnecessary imo. Unfortunately for me, quite a few unholy DKs DO use NotD already, and thus this change only effects some Unholy DKs. <br />
<br />
You may say &quot;stop the QQ, they're just balancing you, every class has to deal with nerfs/changes they may not like, deal with it,&quot; and you'd probably be right. This is just my opinion, and do intend to simply deal with it and put 1 less point into something than i originally planned to. I just find it annoying &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Open with Rake-&gt;Maim-&gt;Mangle-&gt;Shred. Ice block = restealth or powershift out of snares/roots if he breaks right away and tries to run. Running at +50% movement speed + Powershift out of slows isn't that hard to catch a mage unless he blinks.<br />
<br />
Blink? BEAR charge for the 4 second root. Switch to caster and cast roots, you get CS'ed of course. Back to bear and bash, root when the CS wears off. Resume DPS, using maim as a root. Really not that hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Um im hoping that the start where you open with &quot;Rake&quot; is because you dont have stealth or didnt have the opportunity to get into stealth before the mage hit you because otherwise you shouldnt be commenting on someone elses pvp because any smart druid would open with pounce for the free stun then the mage blinks ok bear feral charge, and if u dont know the rest im not here to tell you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
He has his reasons.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah, rake does almost as much damage as pounce, takes less time to do it, costs less so you can get more attacks in before block or blink...try it sometime.* It works out a lot better than pounce or ravage.* Ravage sucks against mages, you need a bleed up for your shreds to max damage (bleeding/stunned/mangle shred does more damage than ravage, and for less energy...)<br />
<br />
Oh, and rake can crit for 2 CP maim (4 seconds incap atm) allowing more time for your opener.* Pounce is simply a 4 second stun that will get blinked out of.* <br />
<br />
3.1 I'd probably use pounce since they can blink out of maim.* Fight will change a little, but feral with opener should always have the upper hand.<br />
<br />
<br />
He seems to be under the impression that Pounce is used for damage and does a worse job at CC and that saving 15 energy + applying a longer bleed will somehow allow him to set up a Shred to do more damage then this opener called Ravage ?<br />
<br />
Seems like over complicating to me. I'd rather just open with a Ravage to inflict massive damage on the _cloth_ player so he's down quite some HP. And since Feral Druids aren't shy of utility tools that allow you to catch up with someone, Mages especially will negate anything you try to set up as a opener with a well timed Blink.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Night of the Dead is a really good talent. I don't understand why you don't put points in it. <br />
1. It should net you a rather good damage increase from the Army of the Dead cooldown reduction. Use it on every boss attempt instead of every other, twice on some bosses.<br />
2. Survivability on the Ghoul, one of the largest damage sources you've got, is increased manifold. This is two points to protect your one strongest talent point to ensure it still work.<br />
3. In the, now unlikely, even that your Ghoul should die, it reduces the time to resummon it. Extremely useful in +3, for instance, where the flame wave DOT will likely kill your pet a few times.<br />
<br />
So in essence, a good talent is now a prerequisite for an extremely good talent. I can't really think of 3 talent points better spent - in any spec for any class. Except maybe Divine Storm.<br />
<br />
The only thing you can legitimately cry about is that non-Unholy specs are now quasi-expected to take points in NotD to ensure their temporary Ghouls survival and that those same specs can no longer benefit from perma-Ghoul - a talent which previously allowed them to compete on equal terms to Unholy in terms of damage.<br />

Welcome to the world of warcraft, let's start the tutorial: stuns don't break on damage. See you again, same place same time for more awesome tips.<br />
<br />
These comments are referring to fears, not stuns.<br />
&lt;/tutorial&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The comments were about the iniquity of stuns compared to the fears and cc's they nerfed. Why shouldn't stuns also break on damage. If they don't, stun classes will have a significant pvp advantage over classes with the other forms of cc.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Edea</div><div class="date">2009-03-28, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">stuns breaking on damage wouldn't make sence for many classes. the reason they nerfed fear to break early was that warlocks chain feared a player untill he was dead. not many classes can &quot;chain-stun&quot;. a ret pally can stun once every 30 sec (talented) and in season 6 it will be nerfed to once every 40 sec. a mage's deep freeze stun breaking on damage would be hilarious, it wouldn't be much different than a regular frost nova then, you can chain-deep freeze. However i don't think this fear nerf should count on the priest fear as they cant spam that in any way, its fine as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Stuns are way shorter than fears, and your target doesn't range himself when stunned. Also, they cannot be spammed, unlike most fears. Honestly, as a melee class, if I get caught without a way out of fear (such as when they've already spammed it and forced me to burn my &quot;outs&quot;) and run in a straight line away from a ranged DPS for 8-12 seconds, I'm pretty much in big-um heap trouble by the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to me that a lot of trouble with new mage build could be fixed with a buff to the mana gem. The 2 piece bonus for T7.5 will be lost, and even with that mana wa a big issue fo rmages. I see a couple of possible solutions. <br />
<br />
1. A glyph that allows double mana return for mana gem<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
2. A change in the talent tree. Most likely an addition to Student of the mind that increases mana gem return by 33/66/100. <br />
<br />
I think a change to the talent tree is probably the best solution since SoM will be a nice talent to have with the changes in Spirit usage, and it is a mechanic should be in place without giving something else up.</div></div><hr />

NO ! Ok maybe rogues were fine if they were on top DPS which... they are not unless you raid runs suxx... -.-<br />
If you don't have at least one TG war, 1 Hunter, 1 Mage , 1 Elemental Shaman or 1 DK in front of you in every raid boss your guildies are doing something wrong... Just so that you know.(except if you are HAT in which you top the meters on Loatheb...)<br />
<br />
You would be right if i saw nerfs to those classes dps... but til now... only Wars got nerfs to PvE Damage...<br />

And which Heirloom (2H) weapons would a levelling feral wear?<br />

Predatory Strikes: This talent now properly affects the attack power gained from weapon enchants.<br />

Well that's nice - has anyone tested yet whether this affects the Berserking proc, too?</div></div><hr />

Actually this means the opposite. It says that the damage needed to break it has been reduces meaning it will break sooner. <br />

Welcome to the world of warcraft, let's start the tutorial: stuns don't break on damage. See you again, same place same time for more awesome tips.<br />
<br />
These comments are referring to fears, not stuns.<br />
&lt;/tutorial&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The comments were about the iniquity of stuns compared to the fears and cc's they nerfed. Why shouldn't stuns also break on damage. If they don't, stun classes will have a significant pvp advantage over classes with the other forms of cc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong: stuns will be stronger than some CCs (not counting that fear gets people to range which gives the ranged classes a big advantage so its not even worse) but you can't measure all class balance by one ability, that's stupid. Classes have other things and most of the classes that have these abilities have ranged damage for instance which is a big advantage against a lot of other classes. Not to mention abilities that actually do damage, unlike rogues.</div></div><hr />

This is just an unneeded change for the worse elitist to think they are better by having a bunch of glyphs at hand and always changing between fights, and saying you suck if you don't do that.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying everyone is like that, thats an extreme example...<br />
<br />
I think...</div></div><hr />

I assume you haven't been playing very long yet. I think the 2.0.10 (http://www.wowwiki.com/Patch_2.0.10#Druids) bear HP, Armor and threat nerf, based on performance in levelling dungeons in mostly quest greens and blues, before most people actually started raiding, was way harsher than this one. <br />
There were several other patches were ferals were nerfed (usually to be buffed again later) and this one is only drawing so much attention because a) the test phase is rather long and b) more noobs that complain about everything are playing nowadays.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You got to be joking. The 2.0.10 nerfs were not even close as bad as what's coming in 3.1. Armor was nerfed because there was tanking leather with bonus armor on it and feral weapons with armor. You could reach armor cap with crafted and rep items. Hell, I've had more armor with raid gear at lv70 than I've seen on 3.1 PTR. And the hp nerf? Sure the hp to stamina change was bad, but at least the stamina buffs were multiplied by the bear form.<br />
<br />
Don't forget back then feral druids were the only tanks that would decently tank dungeons cause warriors were only single target tanks and paladins weren't tanks back then. As tanks for filling the tanking role in TBC blizzard nerfed feral druids to the ground. Reroll the wrong class and you might end up nerfed to the ground in the next patch.<br />
<br />
It's time to move on and forget about this game.</div></div><hr />
