I'm not sure if your being sarcastic, but we did actually kill Azgalor, it's required before you can attempt Archimonde, go figure. We just didn't feel the need of making a post about it but he did actually go down friday the 8th ;p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm wondering: You actually get to kill him all by the players themselves?<br />
<br />
I mean... you need several legendary weapons to kill Kaelthas and the help of Akama and Maiev to kill Illidan, yet you can just walk up there and beat the living crap out of Archimonde, who is an Arch-demonlord and probably can wtfpwn the former two, with one hand tied behind him???<br />
<br />
Plus, didn't him got blown up along with the world tree in the original event, and the players were sent back in time to make sure everything happen exactly as they did?<br />
<br />
Please please tell me there's something more to this fight.... or else it'd be MAJORLY LORELOL on Bliz's side...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you give more details? <br />
<br />
I understand you guys probably dont wanna reveal the strategy yet but I just care about the lore part,<br />
<br />
Is there like a time limit you have to hold him off? Does it go to a scripted event after he goes down certain percentage? It'd be great if you can shed some light, thx!</div></div><hr />
