I think it makes sense, since this nerf would affect the ffb-spec pretty harsh. And since it's the weakest one of the three PvE-Raidspeccs a nerf here wouldn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

I'm amazed; these set bonusses are actually very nice. Just imagine a starfire eclipse proc with some lucky instants extra, it could influence our dps a lot depending on the proc rate of the 4p set bonus.<br />
<br />
It could also prove amazing for pvp, the only way we should be able to get a starfire off is if it's instant.<br />
Although the pushback change for starfire isn't bad either.</div></div><hr />

Lol, that's bullshit and you know it. This is a HUGE buff to Mut DPS, and tbh, it needs it right now. This will help bring it in line with combat, and it makes the spec more enjoyable to play as well. I would say it easily overrides my dislike of the previous HfB change as well.</div></div><hr />

Kyth - Did blizzard actually ever announce that scorch would be reduced to 5% ? as far as I know, that was just speculation..

Survival<br />
Wyvern Sting cooldown has been lowered from 1.5min to 1min. <br />
Resourcefulness now also effects Black Arrow. <br />
Entrapment changed to - When your Frost Trap, Immolation Trap, Explosive Trap and Snake Trap are triggered you entrap all afflicted targets, preventing them from moving for 2/4/6 sec.<br />
Glyph of the Monkey has been removed.<br />
<br />
- Nitroboost Enchant is becomming quite nice now. Think im gonna get it on my new Furious Gladiator Boots.<br />
<br />
- Wyvern Sting back at 1 min CD! Hehe so i gues all the QQing i did on official forums paid of! :D &lt;-- happy Hunter.<br />
<br />
- Nice to see Black Arrow get exactly the same benefits like traps. Lower mana costs, Lower CD, More DPS, procs on Lock and Load, Increases all DMG to a target by another 6%!! Ohw YEAH.<br />
<br />
- The new Entrapment is Awesome! Who needs unreliable random Stuns and Roots when u can have a reliable and timeable root effect for 6 sec on a 22 sec cooldown! Now get Trap Launcher ingame and it will be all good.<br />
<br />
- Glyph of the Monkey has been removed just like i suggested a few posts back. After the HUGE nerf to this pretty awesome glyph (didnt work on aspect of the dragonhawk anymore, and had a hidden CD of 20 seconds). Good thing its removed since it was totally useless since last ptr notes.<br />
<br />
Overall good Surv Hunter changes IMO, BM still has a long way to go i think..</div></div><hr />

<br />
* Haunt now only increases all damage done by your Shadow damage-over-time effects. (Old - All DoT effects)<br />
<br />
Wasn't that already implemented a few builds back?<br />
<br />
<br />
The Ritual of Doom spell doesn't require the Warlock to immediately enslave the doomguard anymore. <br />
<br />
I don't understand this one either. On the live servers, you don't need to enslave at all. You do the ritual, and the doomgaurd is summoned under your control already for 15 minutes, and it does damage to a random person who clicked equal to 50% of their total hp.</div></div><hr />

Actually its a 3 point talent @tier 9 in Holy. And picking up this talent will cost you something else good in the holy tree. Personally id much rather have a set bonus do this and get 3 talent points back ;D</div></div><hr />
