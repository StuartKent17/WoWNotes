Warlords of Draenor - Garrison Resource<br />
Muffinus shared (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/446808409736634368) some more about Garrisons recently, along with letting us know that they will use their own resource. <br />
<br />
At Blizzcon and in previous developer interviews, the team has said that upgrading would take gold and some kind of resource like wood or stone. In the UI shown off at Blizzcon you can see a new icon used to represent whatever resource is being used to build the Garrison. <br />
<br />
The devs also mentioned that some Garrison upgrades may require plans that you cannot purchase, but instead earned through faction rewards, quest rewards, random world drops, or other ways.<br />
<br />

WRT gear &amp; regen changes, do you think some healers won't even bother gearing spirit? Seems like many won't need it.<br />
I think Spirit will still be valuable where you can find it. Being able to heal more aggressively is often desirable. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/442314766933975040))<br />
<br />
do you think that the triage healing model in early cata was a success/failure?<br />
There were many positive aspects to it, but in 4.0 it was too easy to run out of mana and be left feeling helpless. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440943320593072129))<br />
There was a big uprising about it, people complained about lack of healers until Blizzard finally fixed it via patch.<br />
Sounds like you're imagining a repeat of Early Cata's healing model. We made several big mistakes there. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442159921086201856))<br />
But it had some upsides too. For Warlords, we're taking those upsides, combined with other better gameplay. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442160079794491392))<br />
We totally understand and expect skepticism, and look forward to constructive, critical feedback during testing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442160310527340544))<br />
<br />
ONLY ppl who like this are top 10-15% and the PVPr's. Cata was a FAILED exp, everyone knows this. its a game not rl. triage=fail<br />
Question: do you think healing is currently perfect? Should we not try to change it? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/442314219464048640))<br />
<br />
Cata healing was so bad that I quit for over a year. Frustrating = challenge is not fun to play. Please don't repeat mistakes<br />
I understand where you're coming from. The goal is for nothing about this to feel frustrating. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/442317104956444673))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
One question... about the item squish... at lv 90 endgear we're much much more powerful than with fresh 90. Same with lv 100?<br />
Yes, item progression is an essential part of WoW. You'll still get significantly stronger over the course of WoD. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440847629962850304))<br />
in WoD, all flex-style raids will no longer have LFR-like random loot? I vastly preferred that to leaders having master options.<br />
Personal loot (LFR-style) will be available as a loot option for the leader to set; we expect it to be popular with PUGs. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440889118839406592))<br />
<br />
with the ilvl squish. Can you guys remove the ilvl requirements for lvl up dungeons in Cata and MoP please. Seems redundant now.<br />
Yes, we can do that -- good suggestion. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/441572780199251968))<br />
<br />
ilvl squish, how will this affect soloing flame leviathan since vehicles scale with ilvl?<br />
Shouldn't affect it. Item levels aren't changing, just the stat curve as item level increases. You'll still be able to solo it NP. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/441613101243191296))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Do you ever consider what you could do if more and more go to the horde side to pvp down the road?<br />
We've been talking about it. A good question is, what would it take for Horde PvP players to switch to Alliance? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439125428708454400))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
I am also predicting that the whole increasing follower xp is merged with the Armory?<br />
Each building you choose will have a unique and AWESOME purpose, more info to come in the future! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442167999911297024))<br />
<br />
I like the fountain. Is that a default doodad, or do we get to pick?<br />
not a complete answer, but we want to focus as many of your choices around gameplay as possible, high impact decisions! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442168942597926912))<br />
<br />
So whats the deal w/garrisons and alts? Account-wide, or are we asked to micromanage 11 garrisons every day like MoP farms today?<br />
This is a key part of our garrisons discussions, def. want to avoid the &quot;log in and farm on 7 toons every day&quot; gameplay. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442171098470178816))<br />
<br />
How long does it take a building to upgrade for construction. Say lvl 1 town hall going to a lvl 2 town hall?<br />
Still in flux, will really appreciate some feedback once we get the beta going (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442174450880876544))<br />
<br />
How interactive will Followers be? Will they be quiet NPCs wandering around or can you talk to them and learn about them further?<br />
Highly interactive! Some will want you to escort them to chop wood, others will have an epic followup quest to realize their dream (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442198995461341184))<br />
<br />
Oh good, I can't wait to make a garrison that looks like every boring human town that has been in game since vanilla.<br />
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at the interactivity of each building from tier 1 to tier 3+ (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442199393303678976))<br />
<br />
will garrison proff buildings act differently if you have the proff?<br />
There are definite bonuses for having both the building and the profession. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442501028009627648))<br />

Expansion Duration Graphs<br />
Bashiok shared (http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/210dy9/patch_length_a_visual_guide/cg8h3b7?context=3) some graphs that he came across on Twitter (https://twitter.com/Sivation/status/447056152971710464) that put the duration of Mists of Pandaira into context, as well as replying to a few concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Not intending any commentary, I just thought it was interesting seeing it laid out like that. I certainly would not have guessed the patch cycles would have looked like that.<br />
<br />
It's not only that 5.4 will take a year, it's that it will take a year and they &quot;promised&quot; it wouldn't. You can't commit yourselves to &quot;no more year-long raid tier&quot; and then completely flip the script and expect your paying customers to just understand...<br />
I don't recall seeing/hearing/relating any promises. We always have the best intentions to improve, though.<br />
<br />
I guess I misunderstood Bobby Kotick when he said: &quot;To address this, we’re working to release new content more frequently to keep our players engaged longer and make it easier for lapsed players to come back into the game&quot;<br />
Yeah, I suppose, because that's not a promise, that's an intention to improve.</div></div><hr />

Remember TBC? You couldn't start the next tier of raiding until your guild was properly geared or you would be crushed to pieces. There was no stupid 4 difficulties of raids, just one. Some guilds progressed faster and some slower, but when the last content patch was released most guilds weren't even finished with the previous one.<br />
And this is where you probably say something like &quot;well, it's like that now too, not many guilds finish heroic raids before content patches&quot;. And you are of course correct, but the difference is that now you can just abandon that progress and jump on the next tier because your gear is sufficient.<br />
I'm not being elitist in any way, quite the opposite. In order to have content last longer make compleing it a requirement before you can continue on to the next step. Put in gear checks. I'm very tired of doing the same content over and over again on different difficulties.<br />
Imagine that Tier 1-4 (normal/wod heroic) gear was nowhere near what was needed for killing the first boss of Tier1 mythic raiding. I miss the feeling of clearing Black Temple and having to farm it for a few weeks before attempting Sunwell.</div></div><hr />

True that it wasn't a promise, and honestly they HAVE improved a lot in terms of speed during MoP-the patches have been like clockwork-but then they just dropped all the balls they were holding. No idea what happened at the end. I mean I know they start working on expansions much earlier than Blizzcon, and that I do remember them announcing that they were further along with this in the background than they were with MoP when they showed it. In theory, they really should have easily been able to pull off a late June release, especially without giving a 5.5, having worked for a long time, being further along, and having much fewer potential problems than the past two expansions(Cata when they blew up and remade the entire 1-60 world and MoP when they put in a new talent system, new race, new class, new starting zone, etc.) The biggest things are the models(some of which are already fully implemented according to a few of those videos that have been shown), and Garrisons. <br />
<br />
Something had to happen in the background to severely rust up the gears, so to speak. Maybe Garrisons ended up just as bad as blowing up and remaking all of Azeroth. Or maybe they just flat-out screwed up somewhere and are trying to cover it in PR(I mean I know from a business angle they can't well admit 'we screwed up' if they did.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to me it isnt lol i've never had over 8k gold in my life,but that's mainly due to me never being arsed to farm anything or craft anything worth while after my pants disaster (*) and with having 3 kids to juggle and my own life to do it's pretty hard to waste time making gold,i just get in do my dailies or what ever and quest or level up then out again.<br />
<br />
* The pants disaster is as follows,i thought &quot;oh why not just this once make something current tier and worth about 40k&quot; so i spent a few weeks making the mats for Gorge Stalker Legplates which are 553 ilvl and at the time the market was between 30-40k for them,but i just completed them (due to time constraints as i mentioned before aka life) when the new patch hit,and ofc the price dropped to 8k in an instant! To add more insult to injury i have yet to sell the bloody pants even after the 22k-33k drop.<br />

That really depends on the server. On my server, no one uses the AH any more because the prices are just outright ridiculous. It's much less painful to just go out and farm, which in turn means very few people are actually making a decent amount of income. Connected realms should have helped, but we were already outnumbered by alliance 5-1 and when they finally did the connection, they connected us with another realm that had about 200 active Horde pop. So now we're outnumbered about 8-1, and having to fight with an imbalance like that means there is almost no gold on the Horde side.</div></div><hr />

I've been really annoyed when people kept saying Mists had faster raid tiers, but it did not, as clearly shown in the graphs. They were just going off that comment from Blizz about faster content and assuming it to be true. Mists just had more patches than Cata, but the Raid tiers have been the same. And in the case of the last tier, we had the Mists beta by now for Cata. So where is the WoD beta?!?! We're still at Soon... It has to come out immediately if they want to keep SoO the same length as DS; otherwise it's going to be longer. Granted SoO has twice as many bosses as DS did, so people should get more time out of it, but it's still the last tier and there isn't a whole lot of incentive for farming it.</div></div><hr />

It just takes time to make a game and without some artificial barriers content really won't last long enough. An expansion pack takes just as much time to make as a new game and two years is very reasonable. I really don't expect a single game to entertain me 24/7 for two years. That's why I don't really understand why people are so mad, but apparently it is impossible for them to unsubscribe for a few months and enjoy something else for a while and come back when the new xpac hits. Actually reminds me of a discussion I had with a player in-game who couldn't stop raging about Blizzard (during Cata) not able to be doing anything right in his view. then I asked why he was still online then while he clearly wasn't enjoying it anymore. His response? 'Because his subscription hadn't run out yet'... Riiight... and Blizzard was the problem here?!</div></div><hr />

You may find it takes a month or 2 to make 10k using that wing and upgrading it increases the gold making abilities. If you compare it to the cooking assistant in mop it took lots of work and also an small amount of gold too to level that up but considering how long we keep it for an how many days of usage it was an extremely valuable investment.<br />
<br />
I will most likely be like almost everything in wow is. You get much higher reward for it the more gold and effort you ut into developing it. Very much like your charater gear through crafting.<br />

I do have huge issues with final patch and expansion timings. Fair enough they didnt promise empahically times would be reduced but politicians do not do this either. They say we are working in detail to (insert problem here) &amp; if they dont manage anything they claim proirities have changed to defend it.

Easy, Blizzard realized they needed more content to appeal to the &quot;discovery&quot; aspect of the game. So they hired a crap ton of content designers. Then they had problems putting all the pieces together in working order, so they needed a lot more time then they thought they would.<br />

Technically the third tier in TBC isn't a real tier, since the chart counts 2.3 and Zul'Aman as it's own tier, but ZA was on TK/SSC level and BT was out already os Tier B and C on that chart should really be one tier. Yeah ZA was a new tier, but def not another tier.</div></div><hr />

However, Blizzard could also have an intention to make a promise or tries to look like it has an intention to make a promise while it's also possible that Blizzard only wants to try to look like that it's trying to have an intention to make a promise. So in principle, Blizzard could have unofficially authorised information that is official or officially authorised information which is unofficial so the information could be unofficially official or officially unofficial.

<br />
I laughed out loud to this. Quite hilarious. As for bashiok, hopefully he promises to go fuck himself. They told us it wouldn't happen again. They lied. End of discussion.<br />
<br />
Why would you laugh? it is a smart move to make it optional. If you are in a guild group, then sure you may want normal loot rules, but flex is very easy content and very easy to PUG.. and I think most people would be more comfortable with LFR-Personal loot for a full PUG or even with a half-guild PUG because otherwise of course those guys are going to try to funnel gear to their guildmates. Loot drama is an issue in full guild-runs, throw in 5-10 people from /2 and you are just asking for problems.<br />
<br />
And dude, you need to grow up ´they told us this wouldn´t happen again´... no they didn´t. They did exactly what Bashiok said, they said they don´t want it to happen again. They said what they wanted to do and they failed. Call them out for failing to achieve their goals, that is fair... but anyone with any amount of brains knows that they purposefully avoid promising anything ( for about 6 years now) simple because they don´t want to deal with immature people quoting them and calling them liars. You will never hear a Blizz employee making a firm promise, they know better.<br />
<br />
But past that, I do think it is time they start looking for a real production manager, someone who has the teeth to keep them on schedule. The whole fiasco with Cata just shows whomever this person is, cannot do his job. Cata was the biggest failure expansion because he allowed the quest designers to gut 1-60 completely rather than do what they were intending to do originally. This meant they were lacking lvl 85 content.<br />
<br />
I also think they need to plan better for their own failures. One of the problems is they frontload so much into the first week of an expansion. Like 5.0 a ton of that content could have been added 3 months after launch and then kept adding more every 3 months. The problem is, they slam so much at the beginning and you feel overwhelmed for 2 weeks... then you end up with 12 months at the end doing nothing. Maybe it would be better if they held content back in order to feed us steadily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to the chart:<br />
<br />
Start date: Approx. March. 12, 2014 (approx. 532 days after Mists launch)<br />
<br />
Median end date: Approx. July 16, 2014 (approx. 659 days after Mists launch)<br />
<br />
Max length end date: Approx. September 10, 2014 (approx. 715 days after Mists launch)<br />
<br />
<br />
Odd that they project the start date for the beta to be early March, right?<br />
<br />
Well, it's also odd that their Closed Beta start dates for Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria are also approx. two weeks earlier than when they became available to players (they peg the Cataclysm beta at about June 16 but it started June 30, and the Mists beta at about June 7 but it started on June 21).<br />
<br />
Does this mean we'll see the Warlords of Draenor closed beta test start... next Wednesday, on March 26, 2014?<br />
<br />
The beta end dates also point at a release in between August and October. Given their &quot;Fall 2014&quot; stance, late September / early October seems the most likely time for a launch, giving us a beta that lasts through most of August.<br />

Because most posters have no common sense. Garrisons are the MAJOR feature of this expansion. Do you really think they are going to price it out of the range of most lvl 90 players who are starting WoD? <br />
<br />
It will be EXACTLY like flight speed. You will pay almost nothing for the first 2 tiers, and then the third tier which will be a very modest increase in power will be the big gold sink. Yes, the third tier of a building may cost 10,000g.. but the difference between lvl 2 and lvl 3 will be small enough that players who don´t upgrade can still play just fine. I mean look at the screenshot.. do you really think a 5% decrease in the time your followers need to stay in your garrision before being sent out on a mission is game-changing? A lvl2 player can send theirs out in 25 hours, a lvl 3 player can send theirs out in 23.5 hours? big deal.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard never promises anything, and those people who claim otherwise are the primary reason that Blizzard has become generally less forthcoming as time has gone on.<br />

So don't play the game then. They have tried to speed up development but it will never be enough to please people like you. As the game gets more advanced and complicated the time to completion gets longer. More employees means they end up doing bigger and better things. Hence why it really won't speed anything up by hiring 10, 20 or 100 more people. <br />
<br />
Same principal of why the rich go broke just as easy as the poor. You spend within your means just like Blizz develops within their means.</div></div><hr />

They said they really liked the daily system they had in this expansion with reputation based story quests. Players seemed positive on it too for what it's worth. So yea, it's an MMO anything is going to be gated to keep people playing.</div></div><hr />

Is this really the best you people can come up with? The whole &quot;well then don't play the game lol&quot;?<br />
<br />
It's quite simple really. They have said numerous times that the DS fiasco was unacceptable and that they would TRYto never let it happen again. Yes I bolded the try part because they didn't promise.<br />
However as a company you should not be so naive as to think your customers will not hold it against you if you say you will try something, fail trying it, and then deny you ever said you would.<br />

<br />
<br />
the other thing the graphs don't clearly show is the fact that you are actually getting less content with each expansion despite the time frame for each not improving…Wrath, for example, had an extra raid tier according to the chart, plus started with 10 or 11 five mans which had normal and heroic versions and 3 five mans in the final patch …Mists had fewer fives mans at the start, no normal versions and no additional 5 mans in the final patch cycle. Wrath, admittedly didn't have LFR but the effort to create LFR versions is much less than creating an extra raid tier or new 5 mans.<br />
<br />
Bottom line - you're paying the same or more (WoD) for less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They released a list, it's not any mob under elite status it's those mobs that die in one hit regardless of what difficulty you are on such as the skeletons, wasps, stingers in act 3. <br />
<br />
You still get full xp from everything else. As far as sets from T1 and above, this should've been implemented from the start. Torment is the end game difficulty and it made no sense to go backward and steam roll shit to get Set pieces. Besides, T1 is steamroll as it is anyway, so I'm not sure why anyone would complain there.</div></div><hr />

It votes with your wallet, and it lets them know that 'Third time and you still can't get the expac out on time? Unacceptable.' Then they get hit right on the bottom line. <br />
<br />
I sometimes get the impression that if the amount of people who were *that* unhappy as they sounded with Blizz's decisions actually did unsub and say why, they'd actually take a pretty massive sub hit(well, they already have taken a massive hit since Cata.) I tell people often-if you're unhappy, leave the game. That's what I and many others did. Show them you're unhappy. Sure, you can give some constructive feedback on the forum(the constructive is less likely to be shut down), but at the end of the day, if people actually damage them in their bottom line(and yes, they have lots of subs still-but if, say, they lost 2m over the summer, leaving it with about 5.Xm worldwide that's a *lot* of revenue lost, and a world feeling very much lighter after you split that 5.X up around four different territories), maybe they'll actually wise up that they no longer have the 12m padding they used to in Wrath and that maybe they ought to actually try harder to keep to a schedule. <br />
<br />
also with this:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Love how they straight up said last year &quot;A year of the same content is unacceptable&quot;<br />
How long till people realize ANYTHING blizzard CMs/GMs say is just them telling you what you want to hear. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly, they told the truth here. It is unacceptable. It's totally true. Of course what they DIDN'T say is that they'll actually get stuff out on time(and they can say this when people mention it to them, of course), simply that it's unacceptable. They're right-they're just lost atm in actually how to get things out on a sensible schedule. AAA companies are notorious at being pretty bad at time-budgeting. Blizz just happens to be, IMO, one of the worst at it. I don't think they WANT to be late. I simply think they need to seriously learn better time management.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fleshfurnace</div><div class="date">2014-03-22, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you break it down we are getting less and less for our money and they are &quot;over advertising&quot; the few features they think we are all interested in. They stated more content even though overall we're getting less. They said it wouldn't take as long to release the next expansion, but it's much longer than any of us want. It's getting to the point where were paying $100 or more per tier to keep playing the same ol crap instead of getting more stuff faster like they said we would. What's funny to me is blizzard isn't the only company doing this either because almost every game with a sub is bleeding it's customers dry. To put this into perspective if you bought a game at $60 and played it for 4 months you'd probably get tired of it by then and want something new. In wow terms you buy the xpac for $50 so after about 4-5 months of paying another $15 a month ($60-$75) we should get new content. When they take an entire year to bring out new content that's $180 we paid for part of a game.... and they wonder why they keep losing subs mid xpac...<br />
<br />
On the other end of the spectrum is things like steam that have hundreds of free games, and tons that are way cheaper than wow that so many more enjoy longer than playing one game over and over. I love wow and have more or less been playing since about 6 months into vanilla (took a few breaks) but it's getting old and paying so much to keep playing is getting old. Yea you're gonna have all these blind people trying to sell you this &quot;it's only 50 cents a day&quot; crap when you don't pay per day of playtime you pay $15 for a month period.</div></div><hr />

Do you remember when Blizzard had a habit of giving people free days of play whenever they fucked up? They've changed, but some people, maybe including you, just refuse to acknowledge that. They don't release new titles when they are ready or when the community feels that it would be a good time for it. They release strategically to counter their competition. I know some of you more capitalist oriented people will say 'common business practice' and the sad thing is, it really is common business practice. Does not make it OK anyway. Days of customers first are over, and Blizzard is just milking the shit out of everything. Remember D3 Ah? Remember sc2 incident in Korea? Stuff like that wouldn't happen few years ago.

Well if that's going to be our daily hub you should have absolutely no problem with it. Daily's are a good thing and since TBC it always has been nice and most importantly YOUR OWN CHOICE to do your daily's. In MoP they've made it the main progression and that kinda sucked. But daily's are a good progression like style which can't be rushed by the rushers so everyone can enjoy it at almost the same amount of time spent and at the same rate. It's a good thing in a game like WoW, but not as main progression like it was in MoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All parts of the game are optional but most have a requirement to be able to do them. Want to raid heroic but dont want to do the heroics or normals to increase your gear then it would be rare to find a guild to allow you to join them in heroic raiding.<br />
Want to do rated bgs but dont want to gear yourself after farming honor same again most gps wont take you.<br />
Want to upgrade your garrison but dont want to pay for them :P<br />
<br />
I used to struggle to make gold. Always short on repairs etc but in wolk I spent some time practising the ah game I had heard so much about. Nowadays I do very little and have well over 1mill. Im not saying this to show off im trying to show all the peps complaining about 10k that there are ways to not be skint all the time. <br />
Flipping on the ah is very easy way to make huge amounts of gold. It does take a little time and effort to learn at first but once you have its extrememly fast and low effort to make it and those skils will stick all the time in the ah flipping. I used to make 25k every day after spending 5mins each day on the ah. Atm it has gone down to around 7k a day due to the fact that ah profits drop after progression raiding is over.<br />
Just invest a little time into it. Be prepared to lose an amount of gold as when you start you will make mistakes but in the end you will find is fun to open your mail everyday and collect loads of gold.<br />
<br />
There are so many websites and addons that explain and make the ah game so easy. Just type 'wow playing the ah' into google.</div></div><hr />

If you are in a guild group, then sure you may want normal loot rules, but flex is very easy content and very easy to PUG.. and I think most people would be more comfortable with LFR-Personal loot for a full PUG or even with a half-guild PUG because otherwise of course those guys are going to try to funnel gear to their guildmates. Loot drama is an issue in full guild-runs, throw in 5-10 people from /2 and you are just asking for problems.<br />
<br />
Yes because as we all know everyone LOVES getting loot they don't need and are unable to trade it to someone who does...<br />
<br />
<br />
They promised nothing and never do. People like you are the reason why they're so tight lipped. They can't say shit without y'all coming back crying &quot;but you promised!!&quot; <br />
<br />
They didn't survive decades as a business making billions of dollars by making promises whether they could keep them or not. Business 101 kiddo.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No they didn't. Maybe in your own fantasy land but not in reality did they EVER promise anything. <br />
<br />
Find me ONE blue post saying &quot;we promise&quot; and I'll give you a thousand bucks.<br />
<br />
I never said they said the words &quot;we promise&quot;. I said they said it was unacceptable and won't happen again, and that they lied. Not that it matters to you apologists. Saying something like we're the reason they're not forthcoming, I would LOVE that they weren't forthcoming with lies. I would love if they were tightlipped and didn't openly lie to us. Better to stay silent. But again, Blizzard can do no wrong by you so this is useless even replying to you. You are in love, you're completely fine with 13+ months of no content. Then when they finally do provide content after that year without it, you have to pay for it. Not only that, but it's $10 more than usual lol. Why is it $10 more? Because they LIED again and told us we were getting a free character boost but then decided screw that, make them pay for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I wonder what would you do after a few months of having to put up with the toxicity that comes from the community, any sane person after awhile would want to pretty much in a round a bout way to tell the community to take a running jump, I know I would want too.<br />
<br />
Then maybe he should quit. It's literally his job to put up with that shit. If he can't handle getting paid for it then step down and let someone more qualified. The mods around here have to put up with shit daily and they don't even get paid. I have no sympathy for that jackass.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was just reading that Jeremy Feasel dude's twitter responses to people and I'm pretty sure I've counted the word &quot;Savage&quot; at least 10 times now.<br />
<br />
What is this crap? Are they hoping to trademark the word Savage and earn royalties or something? <br />
<br />
And what exactly is so savage about riding a sparkle pony or color changing beanie babie dragon through some Barbie city looking Draenei place or running through fields of violet and rose flowers in moonlit glades? In search of small animals to play pokem... I mean pet battles with? <br />
<br />
You can't just make fetch/savage happen.<br />

Because they ruined the word &quot;epic&quot; and need a new one to trivialize and diminish.</div></div><hr />

I don't disagree, but on the other hand, consider how selfish we all are by nature. Not trying to start some big thing about economics or humanities, but just consider for a second what money is now. It's stronger than any gun or tank or sword or nuke. Money = power, and capitalism is a game the strong play. It's why socialists feel that true free market enterprise is evil, it's based around the core idea that greed is virtuous. Except I don't entirely hate capitalism, it turns our undeniable base nature into a society of constructive and equitable markets wherein we vote with our wallet. When people say &quot;if you don't like it don't play&quot; they're not just being trite, there's wisdom behind the cliche, Blizzard is more a slave to our dollar than we are to their products and services. Some would argue that WoW has created an addiction, but no scientific study has conclusive ruled that...</div></div><hr />

They released a list, it's not any mob under elite status it's those mobs that die in one hit regardless of what difficulty you are on such as the skeletons, wasps, stingers in act 3. <br />
<br />
You still get full xp from everything else. As far as sets from T1 and above, this should've been implemented from the start. Torment is the end game difficulty and it made no sense to go backward and steam roll shit to get Set pieces. Besides, T1 is steamroll as it is anyway, so I'm not sure why anyone would complain there.<br />

They're doing more content outside of raids though, which I think is better. Incidentally, most of Wrath's first tier was a remake of a vanilla raid, and its third tier was all set in one room with reused enemy models, and was thrown together to pad out time before ICC. So if you think about it, really Wrath only had two tiers fully developed for Wrath. Similarly, Naxx was originally built as a vanilla raid and pushed out to TBC.

Ulduar. ICC. And, despite its shortcomings, also ToCr. Those reused enemy models were reused from Wrath models. Similar to several bosses in, say, Mogushan Vaults and Heart of Fear. Also, there was no reason to &quot;pad out time&quot;. People were bitching that the Ulduar tier was too short, not that it was too long. There was an entire idea and concept behind ToCr. It may have been less than stellar, but that entire patch was themed. Not just randomly slapped together. It was planned and thought out beforehand. Not thrown together to appease the community like Sunwell or Ruby Sanctum.</div></div><hr />

That being said the entire WoD snafu is going to cost them a lot of subscribers, though I'm sure they already know this but getting those subs back is going to be difficult after such a lul without content. This is if they take until fall or later to deliver WoD. Lack of content, accessibility of raids, and summer is going to have a HUGE impact on sub numbers. If I wasn't so dedicated to my raid team I would without a doubt cancel my wife's and my own subs until WoD. Throwing it back in our faces about never making promises and calling it an &quot;intention to improve&quot; is completely unacceptable. IIRC they have doubled the WoW team, and while they are still doing a lot with WoD the length of time it's going to take isn't acceptable.<br />
<br />
We'll see how this fall announcement shows when it comes to sub numbers, it might not happen with the current sales quarter with the 90 boost but once summer hits I'm guessing a big drop.</div></div><hr />

Meant to say two.<br />
<br />
I believe what happened is that ICC was taking longer than planned and they felt they needed to pad out the expansion anyway.<br />
<br />
Also being &quot;thrown together&quot; isn't an indication of quality, Sunwell was excellent for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wasn't implying that it was. Just merely saying that ToCr was intended, not merely a throw in to appease the public. Whether ICC was taking too long or it wasn't, designing ToCr, the armor models, designing the fights, designing the dungeon, creating a brand new difficulty mode, etc. wasn't going to help them finish it faster. Blizzard always intended ToCr to exist and be the raid tier between Ulduar and ICC.</div></div><hr />

Blizz never understands the masses don't read there post or anything. They just want to play the game. I am sure that when the masses figure out what is going on they will leave.

Ah so you should be forced to be doing all content before you're allowed to complain? Not everyone enjoys the same thing.

Comments weren't too encouraging either. He basically said they have good intentions but suck at carrying them out. Swell.2<br />

WoD seems very close in depth of WotLK, if that is the case, then it should take them just as long to create that world as it did to create both Cata and MoP combined, because that represents 10 levels of content that is xpac is going to have. Should they have had more in MoP, not sure seems many did not like it anymore than Cata, why waste the time. <br />
<br />
I remember very well the time lapse between BC and Wrath and I measured my time playing accordingly. I have always left enough stuff to complete between xpacs to keep me busy. With the exception of the Annual Pass, I have not participated in a beta, so I really had to make sure I had enough to do if was going to continue to play. In 10 years I have not broke sub once, I feel that is feet most can't even fathom. If fill my time in wisely, mostly grinding rep new and old, gearing out alts (least it is easier now do so in the LFR), leveling new characters and gearing them out on other realms, the list goes on. There are more things to do now than in years past, I still have not completed the Brawlers Guild and the Pet Battle. <br />
<br />
I can see how anyone can say they are bored or do not have anything to do. I think it is just a bunch of people whining because they are butt hurt that they take &quot;good intentions&quot; to be a code word as a promise of something, when in fact it is more of a hope to do so. I am not defending Blizzard on anything, but the statement Bobby Kotick made is not a promise of anything.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to disagree here and it's based on how one defines a &quot;Tier&quot; of content. If you go based on Blizzard's official label of the armor then your chart is correct. However in terms of content you can't discount the sheer size of both AQ40 and Sunwell. AQ is still one of the largest dungeons ever done and while Sunwell wasn't well received, it's problems weren't due to size and difficulty but that the game itself was so far out of balance by that point Sunwell didn't stand a chance. Other than not being labeled tier content by Blizzard(although the did label them as .5) they meet the criteria in every other way. For me Cata was the first content set to offer only 3 tiers and many that I have talked to about this subject agree.</div></div><hr />

In the past was not this whining level… Was more about classes being overpowered and such… We had vanilla for 2 and half years and i don't remember that much people whining about BWL or AQ40 being on for months and months… And more so because Naxx was only for 3 or 4% of the guilds, which made the rest stuck with AQ40 and BWL. People are basically saying &quot;Blizz, you should deliver new content when i'm bored… I'm bored so i should get new content&quot;.<br />
<br />
stuff doesn't work that way. And be thankful for that, otherwise Blizzard games wouldn't be so polished when released as they normally are. You are bored, unsub. Easy as that.</div></div><hr />

* The pants disaster is as follows,i thought &quot;oh why not just this once make something current tier and worth about 40k&quot; so i spent a few weeks making the mats for Gorge Stalker Legplates which are 553 ilvl and at the time the market was between 30-40k for them,but i just completed them (due to time constraints as i mentioned before aka life) when the new patch hit,and ofc the price dropped to 8k in an instant!

So you're an extreme casual player that barely has enough time to play with the base content. If that's the case, there's no point making garrisons free (remove all significant barriers to progression) since you wouldn't really play it much, anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a reason for that. It took us over a month of attempts JUST on Cthun to kill him. After 2-3 months in Naxx the average guild had 1 or 2 wings down. Content that was up for months and months ACTUALLY lasted months and months. Now? After 2 weeks most people have already powered through the normal version of the instance. Heroic modes as it is are a repeat of the same content with some differences in the boss's behavior, not new instances. To a LOT of people, working on heroic content is not working on new content. Its recycled. <br />
<br />
The result is that after 1-2 months of an instance being out, most players have now seen the lore, the location, the bosses, the sights, etc. They have nothing NEW to look foward to. And so they grow bored. Fast. <br />
<br />
The issue isnt that people started complaining more, its that blizzard started cheaping out more and more and trading original content for recycled crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My presumption is that the original intended expansion was not WOD (possibly The Dark Below). Due to the movie being set in the Humans vs Orcs time period they possibly wanted to have the next expansion tie closer to the movie and switched to Warlords of Draenor which was intended to be the following expansion after The Dark Below (thus giving an expansion between the current events &amp; Garrosh's escape). <br />
<br />
Whilst this meant they had started on WOD they were far behind where they needed to be because of the direction change. They moved all resources from Titan back to WoW, cancelled the next content patch which would have set up The Dark Below and are now rushing to try &amp; turn this around in a much shorter time frame. Ghostcrawler probably did not agree with the direction change &amp; left for Riot, Alex Afriasabi was put in charge. They do not have time for new classes, new races or to fly proof Draenor hence the no flying till 6.1 or possibly beyond.</div></div><hr />

If you are so tired of doing the raid then stop doing and stop complaining. No body is forcing you to raid useless you are just staying to not lose your place in the raid. I frankly don't see the problem here, they are basically taking the last two xpacs of content and putting them into one. <br />
<br />
Anyone that thought they could make ten levels of leveling content, plus dungeons, raids, character mods, and garrisons in a year was truly kidding themselves that that was going to happen. I am going back and forth from WoW and D3 presently, so I have more than enough to do over the course of the next 5-7 months to keep me busy. This is probably the most whining I have seen about the next xpac coming out ever. It just amazing how many thought that Blizzard was going to have the content out by now or shortly in beta and then have a summer launch, it unbelievable. <br />
<br />
Also what were your plans, if for some reason you did not get a beta invite? Even if they had a summer launch you would still be doing SoO until then.<br />

The only way MoP was even close to $400 for you is if you had multiple account and that is not Blizzards fault that is yours for pay that much. I know there is no way I have even come close to $400 in 10 years of playing this game. I just recently made another account, so I could RAF, but that cost is on me not Blizzard. This is an old game and they make adjustments each and every xpac to update the engine, they sure has hell are not going to do a total redo of the engine that would take way to much time to update all that for a 10 year old game. These game you list are start from scratch, give them a few years and there engines won't look so hot.</div></div><hr />

You and math are not friends. If MoP makes it to September without a WoD release, that's 24 months. 24x$15=$360. That's only $40 short of $400. MoP cost $40. That makes it $400. Even at this point, between the box and subscription, you've paid $310.<br />
<br />
And if you've truly played for 10 years, even at $13/month, you would have shelled out over $1500 just in subscription fees.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HerrDrache</div><div class="date">2014-03-24, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding &quot;Content and frequency of release&quot;, I'm a little bit miffed as well. I agree that MoP has a metric shit-tonne of content, and while I think it *should* have lasted well through the life of the expansion, it hasn't. My opinion is that the problem was that they wanted to show of a gazillion of new things to do *all* at the *same* *time* - mostly at the beginning.<br />
So in the beginning you're totally overwhelmed with &quot;all that new shit, and OMG!!!&quot;, then if you're in a more casual raiding guild (scrubs, whatever, we did kill stuff) you're hustling to down the last two bosses by the time the next raid comes out (OK, catering to better players isn't bad per se), but then you see SoO's end boss fall and hmmmm.... that's it for the next 6-8 months. Cramming one expansion of stuff into the first 8 months, and then letting things idle for the last 6-8 months, I think that's the problem here. Even I am bored enough to notice things like &quot;oh, look, there's a named mountain goat at Halfhill Market!&quot;, while not seeing players log on anymore - friends in four different guilds that used to raid at different levels, none active anymore.<br />
I know, wrong place to bitch about that, unless I get really lucky and someone important who works at Blizzard reads this ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also there is a reason for that… In the end of TBC it started a never ending whine about the difficulty of the game. Lots of casual said that if they are paying the same they should see the entire game (i'm not saying they were right or wrong, just saying that it happened). In the end it was this whining that lead to the lowering of the difficulty of the game. <br />
<br />
Plus, do you think that WoW would still have this massive player base after 10 years if the end game was only as hard as AQ40, NAXX or Sunwell with no other chance to raid to the more casual playerbase? By this time you would only have 1/3 of the player base, if that much. The different difficulty levels was a clever implementation of the game mechanics. <br />
<br />
And, your opinion, while valid, doesn't make mine invalid. :) What i said remains, Blizzard will not launch/rush new content just because you or the other guy finished the normal version and is bored. Stuff doesn't work that way.<br />
<br />
Plus, in terms of content, i don't see that much differences between spending 4 months in one boss whipping all raiding nights there, as it happened in Vanilla and late TBC, or doing normal and heroic versions of the same instance. In both you are in the same instance. People just want to nitpick and want things their way. <br />

I dont think it was rushed. It was poor designed on some aspects and had some bad gaming decisions. That's different from rushed. Rushed games normally die in the first months, Diablo had some design problems fixed and its running it's course.</div></div><hr />

But no worries I loved World of Warcraft and its lore and just raw feel , but no way was MoP worth the $400 and the sad part is Blizzard has means and ability to give us so much more .But just wait there is a game coming out that will make Blizzard wake up .I knew someday , someone would make a game to challenge them and its Wildstar . It will be the next gen MMO and it runs a whole new engine and stole all great ideas also that blizzard had and from first weekend beta reviews , they have hit a home runs with the player base and what does that mean to us .Blizzard will dust off the wallet and not think so much , how can they make the most money off us with the least content , to &quot;holy hell&quot; we have to produce to keep our sub base . Competition is what makes a better product , so I,m hoping Wildstar delivers . And then Blizzard antes up and deals us what they truly are capable of .<br />

Meanwhile SoO has more bosses than any other expansion, and at more available difficulty levels.<br />
<br />
SoO - 14 (4 difficulty levels, 2(+1?) raid sizes)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ulduar had 14 bosses, and 10 of those bosses had hard modes (beyond just normal and heroic), and a bonus hard mode boss, Algalon. So technically there were 15 possible bosses in Ulduar.<br />
<br />

If memory serves, Naxx also had 15 bosses.</div></div><hr />

If MoP makes it to September without a WoD release, that's 24 months. 24x$15=$360. That's only $40 short of $400. MoP cost $40. That makes it $400. Even at this point, between the box and subscription, you've paid $310.<br />
<br />
And if you've truly played for 10 years, even at $13/month, you would have shelled out over $1500 just in subscription fees.<br />

If that's the case, please implement a DBM for fighting against other player characters. That way I can know exactly when they're going to do a certain ability and prepare myself for it accordingly.<br />

There is an add on for that. They tell you when CDs are used. Let's be honest here--pvp is essentially a flow chart consisting of two decisions. If opponent is vulnerable, &quot;go ham&quot;. If you are vulnerable, use a defensive. I find it funny that people try to pretend that PvP is that so much more difficult than pve. Only real difference is RNG. Sometimes, RNG is pretty much absent in pve on the defensive end. RNG doesn't require skill, either... Its all based on some guy's roll code.</div></div><hr />

Because that add-on is going to tell me the exact moment somebody is going to use any CD, right? Or, for that matter, any ability in their arsenal. PvP IS more difficult because it isn't JUST about &quot;going ham&quot;. Every fight is different because every opponent is different. Not everyone thinks in the same fashion as everyone else. You can't make an accurate prediction regarding anything in PvP. However, you CAN make an accurate prediction in PvE. It will ALWAYS happen in the same way. Every ability will ALWAYS be used at the same time. Once you down a boss a couple times, that boss is on farm. Once you down a player a couple times, that player may go back and rethink of ways to change their rotation or how they react to certain situations.<br />
<br />
Here's a sport analogy for you. PvE is hitting against the pitching machine. PvP is hitting against a live pitcher.</div></div><hr />

This compares Mists assuming a 12/20/14 release date. Considering what people are trying to gauge, I don't see why a graph wouldn't.<br />
<br />
Also time isn't everything. By the time 2.4 (TBC) came out most guilds still hadn't cleared 2.3, which they needed to clear and farm before they could start with 2.4. And by the time the pre-expansion patch came out almost no guilds had cleared 2.4.<br />
<br />
5.4 was cleared in like a week or something? So almost the entire patch is spent killing bosses you've already killed in different difficulties.</div></div><hr />
