Every BlizzCon, we’ve closed out the weekend with a musical performance—but this year, we won’t just have one live band; instead, three diverse musical acts will perform live in our own BlizzCon mini music festival featuring Train, Kristian Nairn, and Lindsey Stirling!<br />
<br />
The closing festivities will begin around 7:30 p.m. with a sendoff from Blizzard. Then the music begins around 8:00 p.m. PDT with Train on the Mythic stage. Kristian Nairn and Lindsey Stirling will follow shortly thereafter in the Overwatch Arena and at the Heroes of the Storm Tournament stage, respectively. The start times for each act are staggered to help ensure you have a chance to see some of each; walk the halls with your friends and fellow Blizzard gamers to enjoy all the festivities!<br />
<br />
TRAIN<br />
Live on the Mythic stage at around 8:00 p.m. PDT<br />
<br />
With numerous Grammy awards and 14 songs on Billboard’s Hot 100 list, Train has been a mainstay of American rock music for 20 years. They’ve released a dozen acclaimed and best-selling albums over the past two decades, spawning countless breakout singles such as “Hey Soul Sister,” “Calling All Angels,” and “Drops of Jupiter” along the way. <br />

<br />
KRISTIAN NAIRN<br />
Live in the Overwatch Arena at around 8:15 p.m. PDT<br />
<br />
Kristian Nairn has been one of Ireland’s most prolific and acclaimed resident DJs for two decades, releasing major remixes of songs from acts like the Freemasons, Madison Avenue, Duke, and more. He’s also brought his progressive EDM sound to clubs and concerts around the world, performing alongside legendary acts like the Scissor Sisters and spearheading his own “Rave of Thrones” club show series. A longtime WoW player, Nairn can’t wait to return to BlizzCon for another epic DJ set with his fellow gamers.<br />

<br />
LINDSEY STIRLING<br />
Live on the Heroes of the Storm Tournament stage at around 8:30 p.m. PDT<br />
<br />
In the over five years since the release of Lindsey Stirling’s 2012 self-titled debut, the electronic music impresario, violinist, dancer, and visual artist has become one of the 21st century’s most innovative stars thanks to her groundbreaking vision of cinematic violin-driven electronic music. Her trademark sound and original choreography have made her headline tours a true spectacle. With her new Christmas album Warmer in the Winter out now, this will be a performance you won’t want to miss.<br />

<br />
Only select portions of the closing festivities will be available as replays after the initial live performances. For the best experience, be sure to watch it live!<br />
<br />

Considering Lindsey Stirling is a well known name and a very popular artist, she's hardly &quot;bottom of the barrel&quot;, Train moreso. Can't say anything for Kristian Nairn though, that's a name I never heard of.</div></div><hr />

Since I am not an idiot, and I know for a fact that Train makes nothing but shitshow songs for people who don't have taste and don't want to listen to people with actual talent, I assume &quot;bangers&quot; is slang for &quot;trash tier songs&quot;?</div></div><hr />

They’re bashing talent because they have none/only want some washed up bullshit “metal” band(to which you can’t even have a mosh pit, was there for Metallica and the crowd was absolutely disgusting in how much it lacked energy.). The only thing I have an issue with is Train, I don’t see this demographic liking them but thankfully I don’t have to see them as there’s 3 stages.</div></div><hr />

Now that she's back in the atmosphere<br />
With drops of Jupiter in her hair, hey, hey<br />
She acts like summer and walks like rain<br />
Reminds me that there's a-time to change, hey, hey<br />
Since the return of her stay on the moon<br />
She listens like spring and she talks like June, hey, hey<br />
Hey, hey<br />
But tell me <br />
did you sail across the sun<br />
Did you make it to the Milky Way <br />
to see the lights all faded<br />
And that heaven is overrated?<br />
Tell me<br />
did you fall from a shooting star<br />
One without a permanent scar<br />
And did you miss me while you were <br />
looking for yourself out there?<br />
<br />
That's Train. :p</div></div><hr />

Ya i guess, will never see her probably, coz she will most likely never visit my country, she mage came covers etc and , at least what i can tell from videos, quite charismatic and a nice person .<br />
<br />
So , ya people should at least give her a try , might not be for everyone but she is cool non the less</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jibjub</div><div class="date">2018-10-25, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Admittedly, Train is a big question mark. I think their music is decent enough (I love 90s bands and they were popular at the tail end of that, I guess [though I'd call them a 2000s band probably, which was a TERRIBLE time for music]) but they seem a bit poppy and soft for Blizzcon. Also... not very relevant.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, Lindsey Stirling is awesome. She will be entertaining. Her pandora station is fun. A lot of Legend of Zelda orchestrations play on it lol.<br />
<br />
Don't know Kristian. But I am far removed from the DJ scene.<br />
<br />
Apropos of nothing... Greta Van Fleet is awesome. They are a bit derivative (still super young, though), but hopefully their success will usher in a new age of music. You know... where bands are made up of musicians, with real drums, and where guitar solos aren't lame. :D</div></div><hr />

Everyone complaining about these acts being ‘bad’ need to recognise that folks have different tastes and spitting vitriol won’t magically make them be your favourite acts. Just chill folks, the music can’t hurt you.<br />

It probably has to do with this being the era of the amatuer. Any fool can write a song and use a program to make a beat while getting high in their basement over a weekend, and then load that piece of garbage onto soundcloud and the other fools will love it.

<br />
There is a video on youtube that explains exactly what started the shit music garbage in general we have today, we had much less of years back.<br />
<br />
There has also been a lot of good music this past decade, you just need to look. Besides that, we only remember the good of the past decades, but back then there was also a lot of bad popular music, those just became irrelevant, just like a lot of music of this generation will be. <br />
<br />
OT: Although Lindsey Stirlings music is not the type of music I would listen, I think it is very fitting for Blizzcon. I haven't heard any of Kristian Nairn, but with his background, he can make it fit. Train on the other hand feels incredibly out of place here.</div></div><hr />

Sheesh..That was out of left field. They were ok for their time at the end of the 90's but I've yet to hear anything really current from them. I personally love Lindsey, but she's definitely a very niche act. Much like Kristian is probably as well. But from his coverage of the Blizzard at Hellfest video this year I think Blizzcon was part of his contract. Such a strange line-up this year...Hell, a line-up at all this time around is odd enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone complaining about these acts being ‘bad’ need to recognise that folks have different tastes and spitting vitriol won’t magically make them be your favourite acts. Just chill folks, the music can’t hurt you.<br />
<br />
Also, am I reading this right that Darin is hosting the contests?! Now that’s a great choice!<br />
<br />
Train has had their music on the Radio for many years. I'm sure if you listened to the Radio at all you probably heard one of their songs atleast. Im personally not a fan of them. but when i saw Train, i was like you, &quot;who the F is that?&quot; then i saw Drops of Jupitor and im like OH Ya i know them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the fjarnskaggl? Turn everything into politics these days, why don't you? &quot;PC lineup&quot; doesn't exist as far as Blizzcon is concerned. Get out of here with that nonsense. None of these bands are politically correct...they're just bands. <br />
<br />
Following your logic, all of the previous Blizzcon acts were even slightly offensive, or unsavory bands. I will laugh my ass off if you think The Foo Fighters, The Offspring, Blink 182, Linkin Park, Weird Al, and Muse are not family-friendly bands. I'm gonna prepare my throat, and stomach for this response.<br />
The one exception would be Ozzy, but kids these days just think he's an old man. Is Ozzy Ozzborne a &quot;non-PC&quot; act? LOL! What a joke?</div></div><hr />

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2g4mjwWvXk , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuJnvC8voJYwhats wrong with her ?? why bash her ?<br />
The reason why is because while she can play a violin, and she can dance, she tries to combine both and fails. She misses notes and is off key a ton. That is why they bash her. The America got talent judges said it best. She has talent, but the movement throws it off.<br />
<br />
Im surprised at these choices. Haven't heard of two of those bands and have only heard of Lindsey, but have not been impressed with the live performances I see. Missing notes all over the place.</div></div><hr />

Triggered much? Relax dude. I'll retract the PC thing. <br />
Let me put it this way: Definitely something feels changed as it was the first time I had to Google all the acts because I had never heard of them. Turns out I actually knew one Train song from over 15 years ago. Maybe it is just cost-savings. For all I know they could very well turn out to be the best performances at Blizzcon ever.<br />
<br />
(and fwiw: not a metal fan, and believe 'smaller' acts are very much more suited for a Blizzcon than the mega-bands. I'd personally go to the Kristian Nairn party as it seems the most fun. I learned from Wikipedia he plays in Game of Thrones. I never watched that show (well, 15 mins once, not my thing, but it is also very popular here))</div></div><hr />

Scared of me laughing at you? Aww. It's too bad you haven't heard of these bands. Train is of the same caliber, if not the same genre as any of the previous Blizzcon bands, so no cost-savings there. Maybe Lindsey, and Kristian are cheaper. I wouldn't know. Also, I agree that the acts for Blizzcon this year could possibly be some of the best ever.

Sure, amatuer music has been made since the harp, but never has it become so available with a single upload. None of those genres, none, were able to exist with a single person spending a weekend with a computer, a bowl, and some shit rhymes about taking drugs in middle school, to then load it on SoundCloud and be a &quot;viral sensation&quot;. Autotune was the start, but always it took playing shows, knowing failure, perseverance, and grit to find one's sound and continue forging their craft. This isn't clutching pearls, this isn't hating genre's or generations of music. This is a complete distaste for how little work is actually put into music these days. And when artists aren't pushed to hone their craft they make slop, and nothing of lasting importance is created.</div></div><hr />

Is that not what makes something successful? Mass consumption? Look at Drake he throws so much out there that 3/4 of it is garbage crap and he hits on a gem sometimes. I agree that out there is a ton of stuff that's not great. But there is some really good out there. What idol, so and so has talent, and the voice, etc along with youtube is that there are a large number of talented people out there. <br />
<br />
Pushing it to the point that in the music industry those that &quot;special&quot; aren't really this 1% cream of the crop no one else can do it give us millions of dollars. Its more common phenomena and maybe they shouldn't be worth millions maybe just more 100ks of bucks. <br />
<br />
Maybe the Rhannas, Christinas, Zepplins, Elvis, Beetles, etc etc aren't as special as they think they are.</div></div><hr />

The point is, why are you crying about music acts at a GAMING CONVENTION?<br />
<br />
You shouldn't expect a music festival level performance at a gaming convention. Get over your own expectations.<br />
<br />
I don't go to Blizzcon. I didn't make that decision by looking at the musical performers and say wow, they suck. I make that decision by looking at the core point of the gaming convention and coming to the conclusion that nothing they do at Blizzcon is worth spending that much money on. Literally the only reason to go would be to meet other people I know, and you can do that with out buying Blizzcon tickets.<br />
<br />
So basically, attempting to fall back on the crutch that &quot;I support anything Blizzard does&quot; is pretty pathetic. I actually am unhappy with basically all of Blizzard's recent game decisions, but I'm not pathetic enough to blame the musical groups at a gaming convention for that.</div></div><hr />

They've done it with every single band that's ever played. In the end they'll all be watching all the same, if they truly didn't care they wouldn't spread salt.<br />
<br />
&quot;They&quot;, usually being metal fans. There's nothing wrong with any of these acts, except they don't have drop D guitars and cookie monster vocals. <br />
<br />
I'll admit, I raised an eyebrow at Train, I didn't know they were still around. Hodor, I've had friends say he puts on a good show (I don't get the DJ thing myself, but it's cool), and Lindsey is a great choice. <br />
<br />
But the &quot;METAAAAAL, dude!&quot; crowd, yeah, they're upset.<br />
<br />
I can make fun of metal fans. I'm one, too, but I like all kinds of music. So I know how dumb they can be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do know these kinds of things are booked months in advance, right? They can't just add shows, it screws up production schedules. Most likely, Triviums equipment will be on the road to the next gig in the tour, when the Blizzcon date is.<br />
<br />
And, if you want metal, go see Trivium. They're playing. Just not at Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay so $6. Lets say watching Hodor is $6 as well, and train is $6. $18 for that. The rest for the Blizzcon convention itself (Which I'll remind people btw is the core point of the convention) covers the remaining $32. Is that worth it to me? No, because I think the convention itself is pretty awful.<br />
<br />
So basically, I don't see your point. You aren't paying $50 to see Lindsey Sterling. If you're paying that its because you are deciding that everything you get from the virtual ticket is worth at least $50. To me it isn't, but that isn't the point.<br />

<br />
What single instrument does she play? Dancing while playing means F all. She is a fine fiddle player but a fiddle player is what she is.<br />
<br />
Dancing while playing a violin means nothing? Okay. Maybe it doesn't to you - but there are a large number of people who find it entertaining and skillful. Just because it doesn't suit YOU is what really doesn't mean F all. If you can't understand that the entire performance is what makes it entertaining, than probably music festivals aren't for you in the first place.<br />
<br />
Live shows are not only about the music. Most times you can get a higher quality version of the songs from a studio recording. You go to a live show to watch the PERFORMANCE alongside the music.</div></div><hr />

Tickets to Blizzcon sold out a while ago. It's literally impossible for it to 'flop&quot; unless nobody shows up - and considering the music is an extra to the entire point of the convention, wishing for the event to flop because you don't like the musical act is about as childish as you can get.<br />

<br />
Jesus wept, again with the nonsense.<br />
<br />
I am comparing it to PREVIOUS years and their closing out acts. Ever single year, barring the opening years, they have laid on a proverbial &quot;lavish spread&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is a convention where they have it live streamed for $40, where live tickets cost in the hundreds of dollars. Where they have thousands of guests, and they are there to push forward all things Blizzard.<br />
We have a con here in Belgium, for a fraction of the price, that offers far, far more. Eg, this year, there was David Tennant, Tom Felton, John Barrowman and others. Now (bear in mind Blizzcon IS a convention), you got all of that for about $30 a ticket per day. They have had Kristian Nairn there as well a couple of times for both evening and daytime gigs.<br />
<br />
Blizzcon is nearly 4x that amount (let alone the stream they charge for), and basically has...fuck all. Seriously, they aren't really going to announce anything special, they aren't going to debut any new games or IPs ( I will be stunned if they do), they are just going to have a couple of groups where they discuss the future of a game, and the big selling bonus point this year, seems to be a 4 level demo of a 15 year old game they have updated (I love Classic, but let's be honest here...).<br />
<br />
The acts themselves are great, that isn't the issue. This isn't about the music, but about the price they are charging and making from it, when you consider the lack of *bang* factor.<br />
Instead of being something there to celebrate Blizzard (from what I recall, Blizzcon was always secondary in the old guards mindset regarding profit, it was there to debut stuff and meet the fans), it seems this year they are minimising their profit/loss ratio and trying to make it sound bigger and better than it is.<br />
<br />
It isn't, it is a bit embarrassing with all honesty. It would be like Comic Con New York thinking &quot;Instead of having the cast of the Marvel films here and major actors/comic companies, let's charge the same price we always do, and have some minor TV actors instead, the fools will stay pay through the roof!&quot;<br />
<br />
THAT is the key thing here, they are charging for a premium product and delivering anything but...<br />
<br />
Honestly, I cannot see how anyone cannot see this as anything but shite, and I am actually a Blizzard apologist on most occasions, but this is just...ugh.</div></div><hr />

The other two sure I get. Hodor isn't a bad DJ I've seen videos and he's at least relevant to the fans in some fashion being on GoT and all. And Lindsey is at least kind of new, exciting, and different. But Train, really?! That is, something....ya...something.<br />

<br />
I can't believe people are complaining about the performers. Blizzard has to work around a bunch of factors: it's a two hour performance for an unenthusiastic audience at a video game convention on a Sunday in Irvine, California. How many touring bands in the area do you think are dying for that gig?<br />
<br />
Fact is, most people attend almost entirely for a chance to meet and spend time with guildmates and go to after parties.<br />
<br />
Pretty much all the announcements happen within the first two hours. After that it's all demos, panels, and esports for three days.<br />
<br />
If you aren't interested in that stuff, maybe just don't buy a ticket. Certainly don't spend $50 on a virtual ticket if you only care about the digital goodie bag and the musical act.</div></div><hr />

Then don't go. Problem solved. <br />

And, the only price that went up is the virtual ticket - the actual event tickets are the same price they've been for 4 years now. And, you have no idea why the charged more for the virtual ticket - bandwidth could be more expensive, but you don't have a single clue why, so you crafted a fairy tale that they did it just to screw you. <br />
<br />
I'd bet more people will be just fine with the acts, already bought tickets, and will have a great time. <br />
<br />
I was wondering where the music announcement was, for about a week. Announcing this late says to me, they probably had issues getting anyone. Bands just don't show up because you wave money at them, they need to be available, affordable, in the general region for the show, and willing to play a video game convention. Could be, nobody was interested. But it's just to screw you, right? I'm seeing plenty of comments from people excited about seeing the acts. But YOU don't like them, so fuck them, right?<br />
<br />
I'm critical of the devs over design decisions (mostly because it's fun, I'm rarely ever actually mad), but some of you need to lighten the fuck up, already. Blizzard doesn't owe you anything. And Blizzcon is about the games, not the concert. So it's not what you like this year - the world will keep turning, even though you didn't get this mythical &quot;lavish spread&quot; you think you deserve.</div></div><hr />

Ah the old &quot;Entitlement&quot; argument, completely missing the fricking point of what I was saying in the first place. Everything they put on is fine, were they a convention offering it at half the price.<br />
They aren't. Please stop with the horseshit &quot;Then don't go!&quot; nonsense. I was pointing out how Blizzard have seemingly stopped caring about connecting with the fans now as much as making a profit. Blizzcon was *always* about getting to see those who love the game on a personal basis, and they did always have a big push for all of it.<br />
<br />
And seriously, arguing about band member availability? You really are pushing the boat out for excuses now. I mean, it isn't as if Blizzard don't do this literally every single year. <br />
Cannot expect more from MMO-C though, usual horseshit excuses defending the symptoms, and not the cause *sigh*.</div></div><hr />

Ah the old &quot;Entitlement&quot; argument, completely missing the fricking point of what I was saying in the first place. Everything they put on is fine, were they a convention offering it at half the price.<br />
They aren't. Please stop with the horseshit &quot;Then don't go!&quot; nonsense. I was pointing out how Blizzard have seemingly stopped caring about connecting with the fans now as much as making a profit. Blizzcon was *always* about getting to see those who love the game on a personal basis, and they did always have a big push for all of it.<br />
<br />
And seriously, arguing about band member availability? You really are pushing the boat out for excuses now. I mean, it isn't as if Blizzard don't do this literally every single year. <br />
Cannot expect more from MMO-C though, usual horseshit excuses defending the symptoms, and not the cause *sigh*.<br />
<br />
All i get from your literal word salad is you're fighting to be a grumpy asshole. The price is the same it's been, and for some reason, you're triggered by that? Or something? And now you're going to put on the &quot;Nobody understands!&quot; act? <br />
<br />
LIGHTEN. THE FUCK. UP. <br />
<br />
PS - I worked in the music industry for years, freelance. Sat with managers as they booked tours. I kind of know what I'm talking about, but I don't need to show credentials, booking a Sunday night show in November is a hard sell, even in LA. Most bands are off the road in the late fall/winter. And you don't need to be an industry insider to know that. But you keep being mad at...something, I guess?</div></div><hr />

Blah, blah, blah.<br />
I am not mad, far from it, just disappointed. Tis isn't a &quot;Nobody understand&quot; crap, no idea where you are pulling that from (except maybe from your backside), but a simple point hat they are charging for a premium convention, and offering very little. Blizzcon has *always* been overpriced for what it offers, and with the gamut of conventions on offer across the board (10 years ago they were niche, now they are big business), you need to stay with the pace. They charge for a premium convention/product, yet provide overall very little, and sadly people still pay for it, yet if you call them out on it, suddenly you're &quot;entitled&quot;.<br />
<br />

I can’t call Train being cheap. It’s a band that sell out the Madison Square Garden and probably cost a shit ton to book.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IIamaKing</div><div class="date">2018-10-25, 06:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay so $6. Lets say watching Hodor is $6 as well, and train is $6. $18 for that. The rest for the Blizzcon convention itself (Which I'll remind people btw is the core point of the convention) covers the remaining $32. Is that worth it to me? No, because I think the convention itself is pretty awful.<br />
<br />
So basically, I don't see your point. You aren't paying $50 to see Lindsey Sterling. If you're paying that its because you are deciding that everything you get from the virtual ticket is worth at least $50. To me it isn't, but that isn't the point.<br />

Dancing while playing a violin means nothing? Okay. Maybe it doesn't to you - but there are a large number of people who find it entertaining and skillful. Just because it doesn't suit YOU is what really doesn't mean F all. If you can't understand that the entire performance is what makes it entertaining, than probably music festivals aren't for you in the first place.<br />
<br />
Live shows are not only about the music. Most times you can get a higher quality version of the songs from a studio recording. You go to a live show to watch the PERFORMANCE alongside the music.<br />
<br />
Means f all in regard to what she is, is what I meant. She is a violinist.<br />

Oh and I spend all summer at live shows. Im not talking about how well she performs Im talking about what she IS, a violinist first and foremost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So...don't buy a ticket?<br />
<br />
Person A thinks Blizzcon isn't worth the price so they don't go. Person B thinks Blizzcon is worth the price so they go. Then we have Person C (you) who doesn't think its worth the price and either is or isn't going anyway, but still wants to complain about it.<br />
<br />
You said it yourself, here I'll quote it:<br />
<br />
yet provide overall very little, and sadly people still pay for it<br />
<br />
People are still paying for it. Which means even if YOU don't think its worth it, and I certainly don't think its worth it, that doesn't suddenly mean they're overcharging. They charge what people will pay, and people are paying for it - enough people that they are comfortable charging the same price.<br />
<br />
So....stop being upset? I haven't gone to a single Blizzcon because not once have I thought it was worth the price. I'm not mad about that, I just have different expectations.<br />
<br />
This is how business works. Look at all these &quot;premium prebuilt gaming pcs&quot; people buy. They're paying a ton for outdated components that they could put together themselves for half the cost or less. They can charge more because people are paying for a brand or paying for the support, or don't want to put one together themselves for any number of reasons, or they're just plain ignorant about the subject matter. Are you going to buy one of those and then complain?<br />
<br />
If you think you can get the same experience from a local convention for a fraction of the price, then go do that. Why does Blizzcon matter?</div></div><hr />

They charge in the region of $200k-$300k per performance (based on college shows and stuff). <br />

Got to be honest, seems a bit overpriced, but i live in EU, where I don't think anyone has heard of them beyond &quot;Hey, Soul Sister&quot; about a decade ago?<br />

Not cheap, but not super expensive either. They could have got Offspring it seems for a lot less XD<br />

Am not upset, far form it, and I understand the point you are making, just trying to put across mine is all :)<br />
I am just pointing out how it seems Blizzard are moving more and more towards making a profit, rather than trying to connect to the fanbase (which seemed to be their mantra a few years back). Seems an overall shift towards &quot;Cash in while we can&quot;, rather than &quot;Make something worthwhile&quot;, and I am honestly a major Blizz fanboy :S<br />

Dude. Money and profits is all Blizzard has cared about for years. This isn't anything new.<br />
<br />
I can't name a single game company that hasn't shifted from &quot;for the players&quot; to &quot;for the profits&quot; after initial success.<br />
<br />
Making something that people want is how you get in the door initially, then you shift it into a profit making machine. Businesses don't care about &quot;the people&quot;. <br />
<br />
Even not-for-profit organizations, who's supposedly entire purpose is to help people, have CEOs making triple figures or more in most cases.<br />
<br />
This is why Blizzard has such a huge push for layers of loot RNG in WoW. Subscriber retention; despite most people not liking loot systems they have no control over.</div></div><hr />

They can tho. I refunded my virtual ticket once I saw how pisspoor the wow rewards were. I just contacted CS and it was done not 5 minutes later.<br />

True, but it has never been so apparent as it has now.<br />
I am well versed in the corporate schill money making scheme, but there *are* some organsiations in gaming that do seem to buck the trend. The holy trinity was always Rockstar, Valve, and Blizzard with their &quot;Done when it is done/We care for the game play experience, not the release date&quot; mentality. <br />
Now it seems as if it is just the first two in that list :(<br />
<br />
All that Blizzcon at the moment seems to me is yet another symptom of the underling cause which is &quot;Milk WoW as long as we can&quot; :S</div></div><hr />

He was the DJ at the Diablo party thingie that was outside. He's cool. I don't really dance so a DJ is probably wasted on me, but I will enthusiastically tap my foot.<br />
<br />
Lindsey Stirling seems neat, and I know she's very popular. She usually does dubstep stuff I think? which isn't really my bag, but she's also done a ton of video game covers which is appropriate for a gaming convention. I think that was the first time I heard of her was the Zelda song she did. If nothing else she seems really fun so I will probably enjoy that. <br />
<br />
Train I am not super familiar with. I have heard of them, and I'm sure I've heard them a lot of times since I think they were one of those bands that used to be on the radio all the time, but I couldn't bring an actual songs to mind. Based on what I know (some kind of soft pop rock?), they're probably not my style.<br />
<br />
But whatever. I also don't feel like I'm entitled to like every closing act. There's been some years I loved and some I didn't care for, so I used that time to play games on the floor or beat traffic out of the convention. Blizzard can't please everyone, especially with the huge range of demographics playing their games. There's us old folks who have been around for years playing old Diablos and RTS all the way to the preteens jumping into Overwatch, soccer moms with their hearthstone app, and professional esports folks. There's literally nothing you can pick that would make everyone excited. Y'all angry people aren't special and don't deserve your tastes any more than the next dude.</div></div><hr />

Tbh, i feel like Blizzard never books Artists for the fans at Blizzcon, whilst it is an opportunity for the fans to interact with Blizzard themselves, its also a time for Blizzard to let there hair down so to speak. I mean, I love Metallica, Ozzy, Blink 182...for the nostalgia from when I was like 14 years old, but I feel as if most Blizzcon bands are booked for the guys who work there. I mean if i was Mike Morhaime and liked Metallica, and had the opportunity to book them at my company event...i would.</div></div><hr />

What is hilarious is that Train is only barely relevant at all to somebody that isn’t an “old man”. It should be right in the wheelhouse of bands for those of us that are probably the key demographic still playing WoW. <br />
<br />
Every single band they have picked so far was a band formed in the mid 90’s or earlier so far, like Train is.</div></div><hr />

I don't care much for this band mainly for the fact all their hits were so over-played on radio stations that I just can't stand to hear them anymore. Soul Sister was a good song when it came out and then got played to death afterwards.<br />
<br />
I just find them an...interesting choice considering the past bands. <br />

Let me put it this way: Definitely something feels changed as it was the first time I had to Google all the acts because I had never heard of them. Turns out I actually knew one Train song from over 15 years ago. Maybe it is just cost-savings. For all I know they could very well turn out to be the best performances at Blizzcon ever.<br />
<br />
(and fwiw: not a metal fan, and believe 'smaller' acts are very much more suited for a Blizzcon than the mega-bands. I'd personally go to the Kristian Nairn party as it seems the most fun. I learned from Wikipedia he plays in Game of Thrones. I never watched that show (well, 15 mins once, not my thing, but it is also very popular here))<br />
<br />
My question is, how do you know you dont like a show after only 15 min!?!?</div></div><hr />

I tried reading the book, 300 pages in and it was still boring as hell, didn't even need to watch the show to know I wouldn't like it :P</div></div><hr />

I just don't know how many Blizzard fans are in to that type of music especially when looking at the previous bands they've had. Doesn't really scream &quot;geek band&quot;. <br />

Ditto. Apart from the hodor dudes very mediocre role in GoT I can honestly say that the only famous artist is Lindsay imo. The rest feels like &quot;oh shit we need 2 more acts. Check the street corners for someone!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realise Lindsiy's tracks are recorded while she's not dancing, right?<br />
<br />
She's nowhere near a virtuoso and her dancing is just as basic. The combination of both is gimmicky and might've been fun the first time around, but it got old fast. Tons of background dancers, electronic beats and whatnot dressing up the live performances to distract from the reality that neither the violin playing nor the dancing is really enough to keep the act entertaining enough for an entire show. Apparently some cute dresses and videogame soundtracks had to be thrown into the mix to make it compelling and recognisable enough to find an audience. It's a hodgepodge of things, none of which are particularly well executed or interesting enough on their own. The combination was only interesting the first time around, before we were treated to endless repetitions of the same material with very little variation.<br />
<br />
It's all incredibly bland and boring to listen to compared to what violins are actually capable of.</div></div><hr />

Seemed like the endless 'dramatic pausing' after each weighty delivered fluffy statement captured in a closeup that seems to be endemic in current (US, but not only) series. Did I give it a fair chance? Maybe not, but hey it's television, so I realy don't care much.</div></div><hr />

Think you are mixing up &quot;raising an eyebrow an remarking 'that's odd'&quot; with &quot;crying&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's more like you go to the same guild meetup every year, an there was always a huge pit-roasted barbecue so you all ate half burned yet still under-cooked meat washed down with cans of lukewarm lager, and this year it's suddenly peanuts, carrot sticks and ice cream with boxed white wine from the fridge. Not that you ever went there for the food, and maybe you even like ice cream, but it is still a notable change.</div></div><hr />

Valve doesn't seem to make anything anymore and Acti-Blizzard is off the list, but we can probably add CD Projekt Red and Naughty Dog to go along with Rockstar.

Oh, I forgot totally about CDPR, am a *huge* fan of them, especially their GOG.com site. They seem to be genuinely one of the proverbial &quot;Good Guys&quot;, and the others are doing similar as well, especially Rockstar.<br />
<br />
Seems a changing of the Guard. Valve will always be Valve, and they *do* make games,just when the programmers get around to finishing them I guess or whatever interests them. Just stuns me people assume that hitting a release date and sacrificing quality is an acceptable thing to do, when these Publishers have proven otherwise. And CDPR, to my mind, hardly started off super funded and well known, they made their rep the hard way, through a great product.<br />

Not complaining, but does Train have special rates for corporations? I have seen them pop up in all manner of corporate events relatively small to rather large over the years.<br />
<br />
Seems they charge between $200k-$300k per concert, which to my miind seems absurd (especially for the same price, you can get Disturbed, Snoop Dogg, Tori Amos &amp; *maybe* the Offspring). No idea why they charge so much, might be an American thing, but in the EU, they were one hit wonders to my re-collection, and really nothing special...<br />

Okay, firstly, emo? How does that come into this at all? What's that got to do with anything? I actually would like an explanation for that, because it feels like it was thrown in there for the sake of it. <br />
<br />
But actually, you haven't said why you think todays music sucks at all. You just made a flat statement that music has been terrible for over a decade and that's that. Even here, you haven't shared your opinion, just a video of someone elses &quot;definitive TRUTH&quot; about why modern music is awful, when music is a pretty subjective matter to begin with. <br />
<br />
But okay, if being able to accept that a lot of modern music just isn't for me and being okay with that, while calling you out for doing what every previous generation does when it comes to new music and not needing a special reinforcement bubble for my opinions makes me immature and &quot;emo&quot; then I guess that makes you a doo doo head.</div></div><hr />
