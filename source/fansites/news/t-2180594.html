Patch 7.2 - Monk Class Mount<br />
The Monk class mount only comes with one color variation, but it talks to you! You can hear the different voice lines in the video below. <br />

Shard of Exodar Nerf<br />
While we do think the Shard of the Exodar (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/132410-shard-of-the-exodar) is slightly overperforming, we've been discussing the 7.2 redesign and aren't happy with it, particularly in regards to some usability issues that the change created. We're going to revert the change from Patch 7.2 in an upcoming PTR build, and look into other potential tuning options for the future.

Still better than the mage mount imo, everyone else at least gets something alive, it's a cool design and I like the spec differences but it's not my favourite. I just like having something animal to ride on :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the monk mount but I'm getting sick of the flying ground animals. I hope they give it wings or something because it looks incredibly uncanny. I strongly dislike the Grove Warden mount for the same reason. Like someone else said I would much rather they keep this a ground mount and just make Zen Flight not slow as ass.</div></div><hr />

I mean, it's a disc. It's got next to no animation, and when you stand on it you seem to be frozen from the waist down.At least you get a different color variation for each spec. The Monk class mount is the same for all 3 specs. Kinda sh!tty if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure about the colors with Yu'lei (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87775-yulei-daughter-of-jade) being a spitting image of Yu'lon but I was guessing it was because of Xu-Fu (http://www.wowdb.com/items/101771-xu-fu-cub-of-xuen) &amp; Ban-Fu (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/147542-ban-fu-cub-of-ban-lu); wouldn't be unique if they share the same color. Or they just wanted to &quot;muddy the waters&quot; a bit. :rolleyes:<br />

A winged tiger? Whatever. I like the way it just flies without wings. It's kind of cool and unexpected. Drop the BlizzardHatesMonks bullcrap. We, as a class, are in a very good spot right now and have had a lot of love so far in Legion. Besides, Paladins just get a horse. Another horse.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2017-03-07, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd rather have a mount on my monk, not a mount that can talk to me. I'd rather have 3 recolors (one for each spec) than a talking mount. Why couldn't they have done a black and blue lightning tiger for brewmaster, leave the current one for windwalker, and then do a white and black one (or black with white lightning) for mistweaver? The talking mount is going to get old VERY fast. I can see people quickly looking for mods to either shut it up or replace the sounds with something more akin of other tiger mounts.<br />
<br />
I'm shocked no one is bringing up the goblin vs worgen mount debate. Goblins got new mounts when they got added in Cata but Blizzard refused to add new mounts to the worgens because they had running wild. After months of complaints, Blizzard gave worgens two crappy horses that don't even have tack on them. They're just mobs enabled to be ridden (something Blizzard's repeated such as with the Eclipse dragonhawk). So when are people going to start complaining that monks get 1 color while other classes get 3-4? Demon hunters are in the same boat with 1 color of their mount.<br />
<br />
Suppose it begs the question if the individual colors count toward the mount achievement. I.E. I have a paladin. Do all 4 colors count toward the mount achievement or just 1?<br />
<br />
Additionally, do all of the class mounts count or only one? Like if I were to get the mount on my shaman, would that increase my mount achievement count by 1? Then if I got the druid one, would that further increase the count by 1 (thus +2 for the two class mounts) or would it be like the current warlock and paladin (and technically DK and DH) where the two are mutually exclusive with each other and you only get 1 regardless of what class you're on. I.E. I get the paladin mount which increases my mount count by one. I then later get the monk one but since I already have the paladin mount, my count doesn't increase.<br />
<br />
If the individual colors count as separate mounts, then I can see players pitching a fit over the classes who get 1 color (like monk and DHs) versus those that get 4 (rogue, druid, paladin). If you only get 1 regardless of how many colors and class mounts you have, that'd really suck, too. Makes the work for every other class mount and color not as fun.</div></div><hr />
