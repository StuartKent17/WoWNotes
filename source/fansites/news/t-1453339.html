Then back up another mil or so with WoD in Q2 (assuming it's in Q2)<br />
<br />
In Jaylock's thread, he assumed it would have dropped to 5.7mil or something. That is ~2 mil.<br />
<br />
I mean, I have no illusions that a ~10yr old game won't slowly erode the sub base until the plug is finally pulled at some point, and it will have little bumps and nudges with major patches and expacs, but still, it was definitely worth a chuckle at how wrong some were.</div></div><hr />

It's not lying per se. They can spin numbers any way they want. Like how they include China in their subscription count when there are no subscriptions in China. They include time cards, and there has been great debate on the grey area of including them since even a buck left on the card counts. Who is going to check them on this? Is there a sub police? <br />
<br />
Sure, it's realistic to think that with the last tier, you'd see a spike. That right now is when the free fall is happening. That the next two quarter reports are going to be pretty bad. I still don't trust them. Considering the number manipulation going on in the info graphic. The stuff they flat out lie to us about (Pandas are just for toys not an expansion!). Yeah, I don't buy it.

Typical victim routine. As the 'WoW is dead' type of person, he's used to being on the offense.

Your opinion. It makes no sense. &quot; I hate WoW yet here i am stalking the WoW fan forums... &quot;.<br />
<br />
It is the most fascinating poster on fan forums. On every type too: comic book, gaming, movies, tv... all of it. Avatar ego is a known thing, but... Even with mountains of evidence that shows they are a tiny minority (those that care about sub numbers), they forge ahead with their idea that their preference equals a company's success. It is so personal to their core and valued so highly it defies logic.<br />

a. This is only TO December 31st. 2014. WoW had alot of reduced prices then and SoO was still pretty fresh.<br />
<br />
b. Subs will drop dramatically once people get bored of SoO. Expect next quarter to be a heavy loss. If blizzard thinks it will survive with these numbers for the next 6 months without content they'll be delusional.<br />
<br />
Sub numbers ALWAYS drop between expansions. You and other doomsayers need to take a step back and stop reading so much into these things. At the next expansion release, there'll be an increase in subs. As the content gets older, it'll decrease...nothing new, nothing unexpected, and yet some people jizz their pants over seeing numbers go down...or indeed, up. Which I find hard to understand.<br />

They can spin numbers any way they want. Like how they include China in their subscription count when there are no subscriptions in China. They include time cards, and there has been great debate on the grey area of including them since even a buck left on the card counts. Who is going to check them on this? Is there a sub police? <br />
<br />
Sure, it's realistic to think that with the last tier, you'd see a spike. That right now is when the free fall is happening. That the next two quarter reports are going to be pretty bad. I still don't trust them. Considering the number manipulation going on in the info graphic. The stuff they flat out lie to us about (Pandas are just for toys not an expansion!). Yeah, I don't buy it. I don't think they have anywhere close to 7.8.<br />
<br />
It doesnt matter how they spin numbers; unless they have thought of a new way to do it, 200k subs are 200k subs. They cant just be made up.</div></div><hr />

There might be something to this although if we're entering the long tail or flat part of the curve I would have expected the point at which it settles to be somewhat lower than 7.5(ish). In any case, this is good news and bodes well for interest in the next expansion. Beta will likely start up soon for that and while I expect to see things up and down a bit over the year I think the game is in a pretty good spot at the moment. Congratulations to Blizzard.

<br />
Let's not forget this quarter includes a new RaF mount, plus pets. When they do a new RaF promotion, numbers always rise. Players purchase another account, sometimes more, just to get the mount. With pets added, I'm certain even more people started new accounts just for the rewards. Because you have to pay for 2 months on those accounts to receive the rewards, these fresh accounts stay active for 3 months (can't forget the free month that's included in the box). I wouldn't mind seeing how many of these subs belonged to accounts made shortly after the new RaF promotion.</div></div><hr />

Sure some went to FFXIV, some came back quick though... It's not surprising to see numbers up a little with all the Christmas sales and new RAF program (it would be interesting to know the actual number of unique accounts, disregarding those that are part of a same battle.net account).<br />
<br />
2) But WoD is not coming anytime soon (June or July at best) and some people are just waiting for ESO (come April) and Wildstar (later this year) which could show some loss in WoW subs. It's expected, but some will come back as soon as WoD is announced and the subs will rise and fall again with each content patch. <br />
<br />
3) As someone said, the vast majority of the pure haters / bashers are already gone from the game and the people sticking around who love the game are not likely to vanish in the next months. <br />
<br />
Shortly, WoW is far from dead. Sorry for those who'd love to see this happen ;)</div></div><hr />

Honestly I'm surprised to see the numbers go up. I was expecting a 200-300k loss. Good jerb blizzard, hopefully we'll see a steady growth for the next few quarters.<br />
<br />
Theres some people that will claim that, even if WoW went back to 10 million and not 13 million they will still claim wow is dieing. These are the same people that don't understand Gains and losses and that 7.8 million X $14.99 is still alot and thinks the only way WoW will make money is if they went Free to play.</div></div><hr />

In another thread a guy said this call was for SoO in additional to things such as RaF launching, it was bound to bring some people back. However the next conference call will be a much different story. As for the haters who say 200k is nothing, just piss off already. If it was 200k losses you'd be more than happy to use that number as something significant. Less double standards, kk?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you enjoy the game and play it seriously you wouldn't quit. Raiding and PVP requires weekly play, so even if you only play 1-2 days a week you are still subbed.<br />
This shows anyone who quits the game either has a legitimate reason to stop, or didn't play the game seriously to begin with. <br />
<br />
Doesn't effect anyone. <br />
<br />
As long as there are a few thousand people playing on 1 running server the game will have all it needs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">subanark</div><div class="date">2014-02-06, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to say this is disappointing.<br />
<br />
Every time I see Blizzard lose subscribers, it gives me a small glimmer of hope that they'll realize their mistakes.<br />
I hate MoP with a burning passion because every aspect of the game that I used to enjoy, is now horrible and clunky.<br />
<br />
But I guess the players like myself are dying off in WOW while the casuals and new generation take over.<br />
<br />
For some reason I think some people say &quot;hard core players&quot; when in fact they mean &quot;sadistic players&quot;. The hardest encounter in WoW has steadily gotten harder over the years, and it doesn't look like Blizzard will invoke the DS and ICC monthly nerf for SoO. I consider hard encounters to be hard core, and Wow has those. <br />
<br />
Why do people insist that a hard core game must have the following:<br />
1. Exp and level penalties for dying<br />
2. Massive grinds to gain levels and gears.<br />
3. Loss of equipment if you die.<br />
4. Battles that take over 1 hour to complete.<br />
5. 1 week rare spawns that drops needed for a quest.<br />
6. Professions that have a massive impact in how powerful your character is.<br />
7. Talent choices that are simply &quot;bad&quot; (or combinations that are).<br />
8. Expensive or non-existent talent resets.<br />
9. Unbalanced classes, where you can tell someone that they are bad for choosing the wrong class.<br />
10. Stats you roll at the beginning of the game that you can't change and have a massive impact on how powerful your character is.</div></div><hr />

Probably because they made hate threads, and constantly bashed WoW, seeming like they had a bit of hate in them. So the word hater feels appropriate. Plus that's a lot nicer then what most of them are.. not that embarrassing.</div></div><hr />

2nd worst expansion in your opinion*. Best expansion WoW has ever had in Pancaspe's opinion.<br />
<br />
Both of you are right, since these things are judged on subjective levels. To me, MoP is the best expansion I have experienced. Goes for a lot of people, just as the best expansion to you was no doubt the worst to others.</div></div><hr />

THIS. Plus add &quot;Permadeath&quot;. <br />
<br />
Honestly I feel like there's a small cadre of people just absolutely lusting for a pure vanilla server with PVP flagged on all the time everywhere with no guards and permadeath, so that they can feel sufficiently badass. They further lust for the rest of us to play on this imaginary server with them, and pay for it.</div></div><hr />

Oh trust me on this, they would never ever lie in these quarterly reports. They can bend the truth a little but they will never lie.</div></div><hr />

I dunno, I think if anyone knows their sub numbers if would be Blizz themselves. Donning your tinfoil hat and suddenly saying they're making things up and poisoning our water isn't a very good display of thought.</div></div><hr />

I'm actually happy about the news. But still 200k is nothing.... Comparing to the loss since WoW had 12M players ;)Most mmos would love to have 200k fyi in there game sir.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sansnom</div><div class="date">2014-02-06, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some reason I think some people say &quot;hard core players&quot; when in fact they mean &quot;sadistic players&quot;. The hardest encounter in WoW has steadily gotten harder over the years, and it doesn't look like Blizzard will invoke the DS and ICC monthly nerf for SoO. I consider hard encounters to be hard core, and Wow has those. <br />
<br />
Why do people insist that a hard core game must have the following:<br />
1. Exp and level penalties for dying<br />
2. Massive grinds to gain levels and gears.<br />
3. Loss of equipment if you die.<br />
4. Battles that take over 1 hour to complete.<br />
5. 1 week rare spawns that drops needed for a quest.<br />
6. Professions that have a massive impact in how powerful your character is.<br />
7. Talent choices that are simply &quot;bad&quot; (or combinations that are).<br />
8. Expensive or non-existent talent resets.<br />
9. Unbalanced classes, where you can tell someone that they are bad for choosing the wrong class.<br />
10. Stats you roll at the beginning of the game that you can't change and have a massive impact on how powerful your character is.<br />
<br />
Talk is cheap. Whether players will play in such environment in the long term is unknown. I am sure there will be people who will enjoy play with these restrictions, but how many, 000s? 0000s? 00000s? Would WoW reach its popularity if it had these elements?<br />
<br />
How does it compare with EvE? Never played it myself but I keep hearing how it has elements that many people wish for in WoW. But EvE active subscription is around 250k? Not sure. But it is stable, but it has been stable for years. If WoW had these, maybe it too will be stable in the 00,000s.</div></div><hr />

Wait, are you implying that Blizzard would willingly open itself to lawsuits and federal indictments to trick people on forums?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You HAVE no logical argument or you'd be making it.<br />
Instead you use ad-hominem debate tactics and end up losing your credibility.<br />
<br />
Instead of telling me why you think my claim was illogical, you attempted to passive aggressively insult me.<br />
This is the very root of why people like you will go nowhere. You waste your own time by taking personal offense to opinions you disagree with.<br />
<br />
Your opinion of me means nothing to me. You are nothing to me, and that will never change.<br />
<br />
I didn't use a single ad-hominem, nor did I even bother even trying to refute your heavily-opinionated claim. Pay attention to who you're responding to.<br />
<br />
The only one going ad-hominem here is you.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has their Q4 2013 earnings call today, announcing that WoW is up to 7.8 million subscribers. This is up 200k from the Q3 2013 call (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3509-WoW-Down-to-7-6-Million-Subscribers) that listed WoW at 7.6 million subscribers.<br />
<br />
Clearly Wow is in its final death throes</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I'm saying, they have a habit of bending the truth in the past so I don't trust these numbers without a source. In the end it doesn't really matter. If they gain or lose subs it doesn't affect me. I just don't trust them at their word.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Derah</div><div class="date">2014-02-06, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anything happened to account for this? I don't understand. The game naturally suffers a dip at the end of an expansion. An increase in subscribers is confusing.<br />
<br />
&quot;has anything happened&quot; Are you kidding me? HELLO?!?!?!?!<br />
<br />
Flex-Raid and Connected Realms. That's what happened.<br />
<br />
Those two have got to be one of the most glorious features ever added to the game in its entire life. My server was a dead husk of a ghost shell inside a carcass of emptiness and void. At peak hours during Tuesday night, you could be lucky to find a whooping total of 20 people in trade chat.<br />
<br />
Then it got connected to 3 other realms, and it was like giving the kiss of life to a rotting corpse. All of the sudden there's bustling activity, a bountiful AH, Pugs galore, Guild Recruitment, groups for everything.<br />
<br />
And then there's Flex-Raiding. Raid with whomever, cross-realm, any time, anywhere, with a more stricter filtering system than the LFR (Which has degraded to the point were its not toxic anymore, its full blown radioactive. Not even Chernobyl is as hazardous to your health as LFR is) and almost all the rewards of normal mode.<br />
<br />
The timeless Isle provides hours of fun and entertainment at all times, and is more engaging than the barrens event would ever hope to be. The list goes on and on.</div></div><hr />
