Nethaera posted a huge blue post about about the class changes and also said a few words about the 2.2 and the upcoming patches. I don't really know why I didn't see 3 days ago when it was posted but here it is. &quot;We still have patch 2.2.0 to make live and then after that we will be moving on. That will be sooner than later at this point in time providing all continues to go well.&quot; is probably the most interesting part, but I guess we can't really be sure after 2 months of testing. <br />
There's not a lot more that can be said at this point aside from what was said at BlizzCon and in previous dialogs.<br />
<br />
First to make things very clear, we are looking at more than one class at current and have plans for them. Many of you have already heard that we are looking into things like Ret Paladin improvements and Enhance Shaman improvements as well (among other things). That still holds true.<br />
<br />
We have also said on the side of Priests that we have plans for improvements in the works on some other things on the Holy end as well as have plans to take a close look at defining the Discipline tree a bit more to be more viable as a tree that people would want to utilize more.<br />
<br />
I can ask you for patience and many will respond that you are out of patience, but that is the best course of action right now is to please be patient. There will no doubt be some disappointment when people don't get everything they ever dreamed of for their changes. There will also be some happy results that will come with it as well. Unfortunately, we aren't giving out any information or previews on what we have planned as of yet and are asking people to please wait for it to make it on to the Test Realms and in those notes.<br />
<br />
We are listening and weighing what the community is saying against what we have in mind for the future and making adjustments and changes based on those things. I know many people get tired of us saying this, but please wait for it and please make sure you get in to the test realms and test so that we can get accurate feedback on what is and isn't working so we can continue to make improvements.<br />
<br />
You also all know that we normally don't give out specific patch numbers just in case features or fixes get bumped up or back. Sometimes an issue is more complex and requires more time and sometimes it is much simpler and can be moved up into a closer patch. That said, many of you also have heard mention of patch 2.3 and what will be in it from various sources (some of which are Blizzard employees.) I'd like to advise you that at this point in time, we can't confirm more than what has been said and anything else to the contrary is merely rumor and conjecture. We still have patch 2.2.0 to make live and then after that we will be moving on. That will be sooner than later at this point in time providing all continues to go well. However, we still can't give you a specific date.<br />
<br />
Concerns do not fall on deaf ears but sometimes we may have a difference of opinion. We'll do our best to get you solid information as we are able to do so.<br />

Bradygames Dungeon Companion 2<br />
Bradygames (http://www.bradygames.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=074400912X) released the second version of their Dungeon Companion a few days ago, I can't give you much details about it because it's still hard to find it in France but according to the description, you should find all the strategy for all current dungeons of the Burning Crusade (and even Naxxramas actually). You can get most of these informations for free on various sites but actually I like having everything packed in a single book with a nice layout, and I'm probably not the only one. <br />
<br />
You can buy it here (http://www.bradygames.com/bookstore/product.asp?isbn=074400912X) and even check a preview here (http://www.bradygames.com/content/images/9780744009125/samplechapter/wowdc2sample.pdf) or by clicking the nice image below.<br />

<br />
Just 90%? ;)<br />
<br />
Even from before TBC - or since ever - Blizz reps have been playing spin doctors. While I understand it may do some short term business sense it will probably hurt in the long term. Personally, from being one of the SW houses that I respected the most (along with Bethesda, LucasArts, and a couple more) Blizzard became akin to a bad polititian that we mostly have to put up with. <br />
<br />
Lesson: don't read official foruns :P (half kidding).</div></div><hr />

He told us about ret Paladins how many days do we know about that nearly a month?<br />
or for the Priests and the hunters<br />
Nathaera talks like polititian, nahh!! never who told you that <br />
Blizzard always gives specific and clear awnser's......NOT</div></div><hr />

lol? I hope you're kidding, that's the worse idea i've heard in a long time. holy priests don't lack healing spells... they lack mana endurance, and since 51 talent points takes lvl 60, I would say that 100hp over 30sec would just not make this talent worth it for anyone, even at lvl 80.</div></div><hr />

Unless they put learnable ranks to it. Rank 3-4 being something like 5000hp over 30sec. That would cut it.</div></div><hr />

I think this was a joke... He also put down that the 10 lightwells last for 5seconds before disappearing...<br />
<br />
I think if we get a 51 point talent, it will have to be something to do with either HOLY FORM or some sort of mana regen.</div></div><hr />

I think holy form would be cool, I wish SP druids and shamans werent the only ones to alter their apearance, We should have forms (magical ones so nothing for rogues and warriors, wouldnt fit in) for all casters (fire, frost, arcane, holy, shadow (I know it exists, i m not stupid), demonform (locks) :-)</div></div><hr />
