Predatory Strikes: The Predatory Swiftness buff from this talent now has an 8-second duration.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin<br />
Sacred Shield: The damage absorption effect from this ability now triggers only once every 30 seconds. <br />
Holy<br />
Infusion of Light: This talent now also reduces the cooldown on the effect of Sacred Shield by 12/24 seconds.<br />
Protection<br />
Divine Guardian: This talent no longer increases the amount of damage transferred to the paladin from Divine Sacrifice. Instead it causes all raid and party members to take 10/20% reduced damage while Divine Sacrifice is active. In addition, the duration has been changed to 6 seconds, however the effect does not terminate when Divine Sacrifice is removed before its full duration. <br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
Dungeon System&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; This feature has replaced the Looking For Group tool and provides all-new dungeon party creation functionality.&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; Players can join as individuals, as a full group, or a partial group to look for additional party members.&#13; Groups using this tool will be able to teleport directly to the selected instance. Upon leaving the instance, players will be returned to their original location. If any party member needs to temporarily leave the instance for reagents or repairs, they will have the option to teleport back to the instance.&#13; Players can choose the Random Dungeon option.&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; The Heroic Wrath of the Lich King Daily Random Dungeon option will award two Emblems of Frost no more than once a day.&#13; The normal Wrath of the Lich King Daily Random Dungeon option will award two Emblems of Triumph no more than once a day.&#13; Continuing to complete Wrath of the Lich King Heroic instances using the Daily Random Dungeon option will award players two additional Emblems of Triumph each time. &#13; Daily Heroic and normal dungeon quests have been removed. These quests have been replaced with weekly raid quests (see the &quot;Quests&quot; section for details).&#13; Level-approp&lt;wbr/&gt;riate rewards will be offered to players who choose the Random Dungeon option for pre-Wrath of the Lich King dungeons.&#13; Players can be placed in a group for a random dungeon no more than once every 15 minutes.&#13; Random Dungeon rewards will be placed in each player's inventory automatically upon completion of the dungeon (final boss killed). A pop-up notification will display any rewards earned through the Dungeon System.[/list]&#13;[/list]&#13; Instead of choosing a random dungeon, players can also choose specific dungeons appropriate for their level range. Multiple instances can be selected at one time. The feature no longer limits the choice to look for only 3 dungeon groups at one time.&#13; Pick-Up Groups&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; Cross-realm instances are now available and use an improved matchmaking system to assist players in looking for additional party members. As with Battlegrounds, the realms in each Battlegroup are connected.&#13; As part of the matchmaking system, some of the more difficult dungeons will have a minimum gear requirement. Players also need to meet the requirements for dungeons that require attunement, such as keys or quests. If a player does not meet the requirements for a particular dungeon, a lock icon will be displayed next to that dungeon. Hovering over this icon will display the requirements which have not been met.&#13; Only conjured items and loot dropped in a dungeon for which other party members are eligible can be traded between players from different realms.&#13; A Vote Kick feature will be available in the event a member of a party is not performing to the expectations of the other members.&#13; Players who leave the group prematurely are subject to a Deserter debuff preventing them from using the Dungeon System tool for 15 minutes.&#13; If an existing group loses a member, the leader will be asked if he or she wants to continue the dungeon. Choosing to continue will automatically place the group back into the Dungeon System queue.&#13; A Player will not be placed in a group with people on his or her Ignore list.&#13; Players who take part in groups who have one or more members who have been matched with them randomly from within the Dungeon System will receive extra rewards, up to and including the coveted Perky Pug non-combat pet. The more random players with whom one groups, the faster the pet can be obtained.&#13; The Need Before Greed loot system will be the unalterable default looting system for pick-up groups in the Dungeon System and has been updated.&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; Need Before Greed will now recognize gear appropriate for a class in three ways: the class must be able to equip the item, pure melee will be unable to roll on spell power items, and classes are limited to their dominant armor type (ex. paladins for plate). All items will still be available via Greed rolls as well as the new Disenchant option should no member be able to use the item.&#13; Players will be able to roll on items with a required minimum level higher than a player's current level.&#13;[/list][/list][/list][/list]<br />
&#13;&#13;Looking For Raid&#13;&lt;ul&gt; There is a new Looking For Raid option available to players that can be accessed via the Raid Information screen in the interface or by typing &amp;ldquo;/LFR.&amp;rdquo;&#13;&lt;ul&gt; Players will be able to browse the system manually for any other players looking for a raid dungeon group.&#13; While browsing LFR players may sort the list ascending or descending by left-clicking the following headers: Name, Level, Class, Tank Role, Healer Role, and Damage Role. The crown is the Leader Role (representing a raid group with 2 or more people). Players can left-click on this header to sort the list with groups at the top or at the bottom.&#13; Hovering over players listed in LFR will display their name, class, level, roles and comments. Hovering over a raid/group will display the leader's name, the raid information (number of people the raid), comments, if there are any bosses dead (and which ones), and if there are any friends from your Friends list or ignored players from your Ignore list in the raid group.&#13;[/list]&#13; The Looking For Group chat channel has returned and can be accessed in all major cities (similar to the Trade chat channel) without the use of the Dungeon system interface.&#13; Players may only be queued or listed in one of the following systems at a time: Dungeons, LFR, Battlegrounds, or Arenas.&#13; Ignore List: The amount of characters a person can ignore has been increased to 50. In addition, players on other realms can be placed on the Ignore list. &#13;[/list]&#13;<br />
<br />
Reputation<br />
Commendation Badges which award reputation with various Wrath of the Lich King factions can be purchased with Emblems of Triumph in Dalaran. <br />
<br />
Items<br />
Sceptor of Celebras: Since this item is no longer needed as a key, Celebras will no longer give one out to a player who loses it. The item can now be sold or disenchanted as normal.</div></div><hr />

Edit: The Need Before Greed loot system will be the unalterable default looting system for pick-up groups in the Dungeon System and has been updated.<br />
<br />
-Need Before Greed will now recognize gear appropriate for a class in three ways: the class must be able to equip the item, pure melee will be unable to roll on spell power items, and classes are limited to their dominant armor type (ex. paladins for plate). All items will still be available via Greed rolls as well as the new Disenchant option should no member be able to use the item. <br />

Probably my favorite change after looking through it all carefully.<br />
<br />
P.S. WotF finally nerfed? I thought this day would never come! (Seriously though this is probably to stop everyone from race changing to undead just for an advantage, now that the option is available.)</div></div><hr />

Not really. The first part says Normal random dungeon rewards two EoT once a day. The second part says Heroic instances reward 2 more EoT per go. They don't contradict as Normal doesn't equal Heroic.</div></div><hr />

However, undead need some pve racial buffs to even things out. Such as, underwater breathing gives unlimited breath underwater. Cannibalism reduces the mana/rage/runic/energy cost of your next 3 abilities used in 30 seconds by 100% if you do the full cannibalism cast.</div></div><hr />

I actually see this as blizzard doing us a favor, the nerf won't go live until 3.3 which isn't for a while. Yet they inform you of it as soon as you are able to switch races to save people from spending money on switching to Undead to get an advantage then nerfing it. If they wanted to be really evil they could have let everyone switch then three days later, when the cooldown is up, announce the nerf. In fact they could take this to a whole new level, and make one racial OP every patch to extort money from serious PvPers. Blizzard isn't actually this greedy though. (Though your sig made me *facepalm*)</div></div><hr />

Why don't we remove racials entirely if we're going to be fucking retarded about it every patch.<br />

OR they can put some real effort into balancing the racials instead of it being the train wreck it is. They said they'd revise the racials for Cataclysm. Let's hope they don't fuck it up (again).</div></div><hr />

Are you kidding me? So, this means that for example a moonkin druid wouldn't be able to roll on a cloth belt, even if it was superior to his old gear in every stat, except armor? Thank you, Blizzard, for taking another step in dumbing this game down into infinity. Rest of the changes look OK, though... I suspect there will be some teething issues as usual.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like you can still greed roll on it, you just can't roll need on cloth.<br />

Seems fair, as mages, locks, and priests can't need roll on leather SP gear.</div></div><hr />

Nerf to Prot aswell, as sacred shield is quite the nice selfbuff in the event that there's no Holy Paladin in the group/raid.<br />

I'm a 0/19/52 Ret pvp pally and this change not only takes away 2400 damage absorption (2/2 divine guardian) every 30 seconds, it also pretty much wipes away my chances of getting the HOT from Sheath of Life. It would take tremendous timing/precision to get an Instant Flash of light from art of war proc before the SS absorbs 600 damage not to mention the luck you would need even getting them proc'd at the same time. Same thing goes for trying to get a 1.5s cast off before the SS absorbs 600 damage. You also have to be lucky enough to not be cc'd when the ss procs.<br />

Every patch, nerf nerf nerf nerf nerf, where the hell is that interupt? Never could stop damaging spells from being cast and now I can barely reduce/recover from any damage they do.<br />
<br />
I do BGs, 2v2, 3v3, 5v5 and I honestly think prot/holy paladins are a joke. It probably seems that way to me because I can easily tell that most of them are played by the FOTM types who have no idea what they are doing, they just respecced so they can survive just a little bit longer in a BG or they heard that they were &quot;OP&quot;. I have come across some that I could tell were good and similar to good resto druids, they were nothing more than a of a waste of time to fight 1v1 in a bg, or target first in 5v5.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen many in 2v2. I know they can be pretty OP in 2v2 if the player is good, but I thought blizzard didn't want us doing 2v2 anyways :p</div></div><hr />

Powell do you play a Ret Paladin in a high arena bracket? I gave a pretty detailed description of how it is game changing.<br />

Basically a Ret's only defense now is a bubble that is generally used to remove all Dots/debuffs because its useless to have it up for the entire duration imo, and you typically arent allowed that option anyway with a warrior around.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bogrim</div><div class="date">2009-10-28, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you use your trinket then 45 seconds later you can still use Will of the Forsaken. If you use Will of the Forsaken, you can still use your trinket again 45 seconds later. This change is like when they added Hypothermia to Ice Block, to prevent players from dispelling two fear effects in a row.<br />
<br />
It will make it less devastating in 1v1 but in any group situation, the Undead character will still hold a superior advantage against fear-type classes. The best use of having both trinket and WotF was never to chain dispel to burst down a target, but to save one for when diminishing returns reset.<br />
<br />
It’s suspicious that this change came at the same time as Blizzard announced the race change feature. WotF was only overpowered in 1v1 situations (e.g. undead rogue versus alliance warlock) and Blizzard already stated they didn’t balance the game around 1v1, but it’s understandable they wouldn’t want too many players changing race purely because of WotF is better for solo survival than the other racial abilities.<br />

It's a terrible change. All the people who say it's not fair to roll on cloth, here is your lesson, so pay attention.<br />
<br />
No, you cannot roll on spell power leather/mail/plate. However, you've got a few major things going for you. <br />
<br />
1. There are multiple classes that primarily wear cloth. Look through atlasloot at any given raid, overall they contain more cloth gear for that reason. Blizzard puts more cloth in the game to be rolled on!<br />
2. Spirit is a divisive stat. As an elemental shaman, i don't want that crap.<br />
3. What few spell power noncloth drops there are, are often equipped with stat loadouts appropriate for one spec/type of play. (Thinking mp5 mail gear on this one)<br />
<br />
Now think of how much spell power leather/mail you see. Not much, really. Now thing of how much is [i]itemized[i] appropriately. Again, from an elemental shaman perspective, not much! Look through ulduar, for example. 25man uld contains just 4 sp/crit/haste mail options, while cloth wearers have multiple options from every encounter.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm just not going to use the new interface option until my shaman (who I start the group with and inv noncasters) has all the loot I want from the new dungeon. That's ethical, right? Someone has to invite all the dks/hunters/rogues!</div></div><hr />

Well, no, it's more of a Ret and Prot nerf, but you know what i mean. What I didn't understand was the &quot;telepot to instance&quot; part. Does that mean that summoning stones are now obsolete?</div></div><hr />

Infusion of Light now -permanently- reduces the trigger CD on SS by 24 seconds (back down to its original 6). Duh.<br />
<br />
I was misreading this thinking that the SS CD would be 30 seconds for all specs, but if that each time we got a Holy Shock crit it would reduce the currently remaining CD by 24 seconds, essentially forcing us to spam Shock on each available CD and pray for a crit, or our SS would fall off.<br />

Fear has been continuously nerfed since pvp was introduced.. it breaks if you look at it hard enough<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't talk utter bullshit, fear doesn't break for fuck all even if you have 10 horde fisting you up the ass, if fear broke that easy why the hell would everyone be whining about WOTF? if fear broke that easy why would people trinket it? talk some sense but saying that you're obviously a fear nerd.<br />
<br />
Other nine races, don't humans have a free trinket? why not just give undead the exact same racial as human to balance it out? it's obvious when it comes to PVP racials human are the best then undead were second but not anymore, you sound like a human lock with your biased bullshit, and for the record I have no undead chars anymore before you talk even more bullshit.</div></div><hr />

now when you level alliance characters you can actually do dungeons other than deadmines and stockades. <br />

Wailing caverns, RFD, SFK, scarlet monastary! they were all an absoloute bitch to get to, that is a godsend change for running dungeons with alts.<br />

also, i remember a time when people used to play a class because they like it, not because of racials. if you feel like being a massive powerful tauren, play one.

Who decides whether you need the item more than someone else - fact of the matter is that a cloth wearer can only wear cloth thus can only roll on cloth items. While it might be true that there are more cloth items in the game from personal experience I can say that I haven't seen a tendency of them dropping more often than any of the other armor classes - and a clothy will never be able to roll on anything other than cloth.. while you with your mail or leather proficiency might roll for the (maybe less upgrady item for the mage) win it and soon after the better leather equivalent drops (let's say 2 or 3 dungeons later so you can't play your - &quot;Oh but then I can just trade it due to the 2 hours change&quot;) - now who has been the ninja looter then? This change is absolutely justified.. I wouldn't want to wear cloth if I could wear leather or mail even anyway.. heck just run more dungeons/raids to get the gear that's supposed to be for you</div></div><hr />

Have you read my post above? You can't roll on item that doesn't exist. There's no hc epic leather and plate gloves (except ToC drops) with sp, for example.<br />
Let alone your words about &quot;better equivalent&quot;. There're a lot of situations where not your armor type item is just better itemized, from heroics gear to togc and bis-lists.</div></div><hr />

So basically you're saying there are no drops.. then you say &quot;Oh well in TOC there are drops.. &quot; so what stops you from running toc then?

You're right, there are no SP leather gloves in all the HCs (except TOC which is clearly immune...) - it's as if they presume people will be wearing tier gloves most of the time.

If not, there will be no item to trade anymore if you don't win. I don't see why it should win (in the normal case where people aren't greeding in order to get something to wear) because if it did, people could just ninja the items for vendoring if everyone else is rolling for de. (I'm sure there will be asshats who think some gold is better than the chance of no gold at all due to bad rng.)<br />
<br />
If everyone you pug with were reasonable and you could always agree beforehand on who gets what loot, there wouldn't be a need for a loot distribution system to begin with.<br />
<br />
And yes, I do think each armor class should be primarily for the classes to whom it is the highest they can use to be fair. However, I also think that unless armor as a stat has value to you, you should be allowed to wear the items with the best stats for you.<br />
<br />
I think it would be fairest to let everyone who can benefit from the stats on the item roll need on it and to favour the people to whom it is their primary armor class in the actual roll. Having to roll for something you want to wear against people who want it for money is just unreasonable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember, you can still form a group from your own server and use group loot, if there's specific loot that drops from an instance which you 'need' but can't roll need for it under the Need before Greed rules.<br />

we really need to see the system to know exactly how this works<br />

Seems fair, as mages, locks, and priests can't need roll on leather SP gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, isn't the ability to use both cloth and leather supposed to be one of the perks of playing the druid class? This change effectively negates that perk. What you are saying just sounds to me like a cloth user trying to get fewer people in his need rolls.<br />
Also, I think its becoming more and more like the game does all the thinking for us, and it annoys me. You don't have to organize anything anymore, or coordinate your group at all. You just click on LFG, get put into a group and teleported to the instance, run forward and kill all in sight by hammering the AOE button, and the game automatically distributes the loot, after which you are teleported back to the spot you came from... It's like you don't even have to think at all. It's boring, to be frank.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;Greed&quot; function will no longer be selected...it will either be &quot;Need&quot; or &quot;DE&quot;.<br />

It doesn't matter if you select greed...the DE function now has the same priority....so...if you select greed because it would be an upgrade (Because you can't select NEED)....and the other 4 select DE...you now have a 1 in 5 chance of winning the upgrade instead of it just being sharded...because it's ALWAYS better to DE an item, then to let a class that CAN use an item get it.<br />

Only issue i can see is what the hell it does if cloth drops and there isn't a clothie in group to roll need on it, but then presumably it would open up to leather wearers and if they all pass or aren't in group then goes on to mail etc.<br />
Also unless i misunderstood, this is just for pugging, and if you were using the N/G system for raids you are just asking to get ninja'ed imo and this new system doesn't really change that, unless they decide to itemize and have caster leather drop or caster mail with haste and mp5 which im not actually sure is a better solution...</div></div><hr />

Do you think that the disenchant option works outside of dungeons? For instance would you be able to group with another player somewhere in the world while you quest just so that you can easily DE any greens that drop on the spot?<br />
<br />
Also, would it be possible to get someone to group with you and sit in a dungeon while you run your high level character through some ezmode dungeon so you can quickly farm shards? I'm thinking those with two accounts could do this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The new DE button will cause problems in cases like this....people in PuGs are not going to just pass if they know a drop can be DE'd using the button.<br />
<br />
It's going to boil down to either the &quot;Need&quot; button...or the &quot;DE&quot; button. You're always going to have that one person who would prefer to have a shard...than giving an upgrade to a person.<br />
<br />
Honestly...I think Blizz put this new restriction in after reading about how enchanters are all of a sudden going to start needing on every drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with the way it's currently implemented...especially now that Blizz has already stated:<br />
<br />
-Only conjured items and loot dropped in a dungeon for which other party members are eligible can be traded between players from different realms. <br />

And to the argument that they are nerfing it so everyone does not change their race to undead is a bad one. Recently on our server every raiding guild that had the option to change their class to an Orc has already done so. In our guild we had 2 hunters change to orc, 2 shamans go orc, 2 rogues go orc, 1 warlock go orc, and 1 warrior go orc. So if you're going to use that argument for Undead in PvP, then you need to nerf all other racials that top notch in PvE.<br />
<br />
All racials for all classes have their benefits, whether they are offensive or defensive.<br />
<br />
And for the record, I don't play an undead. My main isn't undead, nor is any of my alts. The nerf however is utterly rediculous.</div></div><hr />

Need &gt; (Greed = Disenchant)<br />

The new NB4G system is meant to be a good catch all &quot;need&quot; system for Pugging. It's purpose is to keep a douche from rolling need on every single drop. That's it. <br />
If your group isn't full of loot whores, you can still come up with your own loot rules by having people roll greed if they need it and pass or disenchant if they don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Need Before Greed will now recognize gear appropriate for a class in three ways: the class must be able to equip the item, pure melee will be unable to roll on spell power items, and classes are limited to their dominant armor type (ex. paladins for plate). All items will still be available via Greed rolls as well as the new Disenchant option should no member be able to use the item. <br />

I wish people would stop using this incredibly crappy argument. The situation you described in your post wont happen, because if the equivalent leather item were to drop 2-3 dungeons later, said item would need to actually exist in the first place. Which it does not (at least not below TotC10 levels)</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why this is all such a big issue. If you raid, get what you can from heroics, run Naxx a few times until you can run TotC a few times until you can run TotGC a few times. If you don't raid, then PvE gear progression is more about looks for you, and unless you're kitting yourself entirely in cloth, you're gonna look stupid mixing it up. And if you're doing this, then shame on you for wanting to roll need over someone who's gearing up legitimately to be able to raid. Furthermore, I would be willing to bet that Blizzard is well aware of itemisation complaints and missing pieces, and is going to try to plug those gaps in the new 5-man dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frankly, although I have a very good raiding guild, I'll be using that LFR on my alts for purely amusement purposes... I expect to see the worst of WoW players, nay, the worst of humanity itself by using that option, but as long as I go there knowing that, I won't be upset.<br />
<br />
EDIT: oh, didn't see the infusion of light change... it makes sense now, but really sucks. I guess I'm not going to be throwing a sacred shield on myself when tanking anymore... used to be good when we were low on holy paladins in a raid, but its not worth it anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We already use portals all the time as it is. I understand people don't like traveling ALL the time but some things should be retained so we have reasons to go out and cross paths in the world instead of just appearing everywhere we have to be.<br />
<br />
I can't stand crossrealm stuff either. I miss the days when each server was a little community. Everyone knew everyone, knew who was good, who was bad, who was nice, and who was a dick. Now we'll be playing with a bunch of people we've never heard of over and over...takes away some of the intimacy of a server.<br />

That's the point, you shouldn't be able to use it, was just another reason why Paladin tanks were the best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you kidding me? So, this means that for example a moonkin druid wouldn't be able to roll on a cloth belt, even if it was superior to his old gear in every stat, except armor? Thank you, Blizzard, for taking another step in dumbing this game down into infinity. Rest of the changes look OK, though... I suspect there will be some teething issues as usual.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup, I was thinking that same thing. That's pretty crappy on Blizzard's part. There's no reason they should be doing this kind of gear policing. If this includes raids and not just 5mans, they're shafting, for example, non-cloth wearers out of some BiS gear - cloth belts and gloves in ToC25. <br />
<br />
All in all, it's just going to eliminate my desire to pug outside of my realm unless I'm simply after badge farming or a trinket/weapon drop. Pretty weak.</div></div><hr />

This is great and all, but they need a city wide general chat too to filter out all the garbage in trade and soon to be LFG. These 2 channels need a cooldown like the old worldwide LFG had since there isn't really any reason to advertise more than once a minute or even longer.</div></div><hr />

Or they could just make the actual BIS gear leather. Also, you can plead to your party members to trade it to you if you feel you want it since you can still trade soulbound items that drop in the dungeon. If a clothy rolled on it though, I doubt he'd forfeit it to you. Cloth wearers already have too much competition.</div></div><hr />

Alts, mostly, or rerolled mains. Unless you're in a huge guild, there might not be that much low level raid or heroic activity in the guild and, for some, their schedules just don't match the rest of the guild's. Or they might not have a guild at all. I for one would want to be able to carry my own weight on the very first raid I run on a newly dinged alt, be that gear through heroics, crafting or badges. And there aren't even that many pugs going to Naxx, Sarth or EoE because you can get better gear elsewhere by running said heroics for badges or from totc 5man or VoA. Especially when ICC comes and you can get Emblems of Triumph from running heroics, Naxx and Ulduar will be almost completely obsolete.<br />

As I said earlier, if someone rolls Greed for Disenchant, there will be nothing to trade if they win. And yeah, Greed and DE will be on the same line. So, people who want to wear &quot;unappropriate&quot; armor type get to choose between trying to keep the trigger happy, 700 dps hunter from rolling for DE and to pass the loot to them or having to try their luck with the rng. Regardless of whether or not there are any toons of the classes that qualify to roll need on them.<br />
<br />
It would seem, however, that the option to disenchant is only available if there is an enchanter in the party:<br />
<br />
Group Disenchanting<br />
Players in a group with an enchanter will now have the option to automatically disenchant any items that are not claimed by a player from within the loot window. Players will have this option available to them in both premade groups and in randomly matched groups. This option is available in any loot system, even if players don’t use the new dungeon tool.</div></div><hr />
