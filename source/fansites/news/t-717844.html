DK Rotations in Cataclysm (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702153222/dks-downtime-and-cataclysm/))<br />
The point is not that we want a DK to hit a yellow attack then sit around waiting until they can do something fun again.<br />
<br />
The point is that we have no room to add anything to the DK rotation. If we wanted to add &quot;clearcasting&quot; style procs or cooldowns finishing sooner or runes regenerating sooner, we can't really do that because the DK doesn't have room in a very tight rotation to use those abilities. If you try and use your GCD on anything else, then the whole rotation collapses because then your runes aren't coming back at the right time or your diseases are expiring or whatever.<br />
<br />
Imagine 1-4 are rotational abilities like Icy Touch and Blood Strike and F = &quot;fun thing&quot;.<br />
<br />
DK rotation today: 1233331233334123333123333<br />
DK rotation in Cataclysm: 123333-F-12-F-33334123333-F- <br />

Am i the only person that doesn't get excited about beta? I don't see the reason to play for 50-60 hours and than have it all erased (lol rerolling is kinda like that though)<br />
<br />
I try to avoid as much info as possible so I can be happy the first month the expansion drops<br />
<br />
Really the most fun I ever have in this game is the first 2 months, doing heroics for the first time undergeared needing to pay attention, grinding it out on a pvp server, making sure you have all your flasks/food before the expansion hits<br />

<br />
Well, it's actually quite easy to conceive why they would allow people with inactive accounts to join the beta. They already have the money of people who are playing. If they can get people who aren't paying all excited about Cataclysm they'll likely reinstate their accounts, resulting in more money for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't see that being a wise business decision when you have more than enough active accounts with similar specs to the inactive ones. And besides, most of the advertising for the expansion(s) that get people to come back that are on the fence about coming back already comes from forums, fan sites and word of mouth. I'm not saying it's never happened, but I'd wager a fair sum of coin that number that came back due to getting into beta is far from worth it from a business standpoint.<br />
<br />
Still, if the inactive folks get an invite, gratz! :D Don't misunderstand, I hope most of us that want one get one, active or not. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No one knows except Blizzard. Remember there have only been three beta events and only two were even applicable to this situation. Personally, I could have swore it said you needed an active account to be selected for the WotLK. I had a couple knock around accounts back in the day that were expired but two active accounts going at that time and both of the active accounts were selected for beta. You'd think Blizzard would have made this perfectly clear by now or at the very least insinuated that you need an active account so people keep upping their subscriptions even if they aren't actively playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Isn't a little early imo for them to annouce this?<br />
<br />
They are simply announcing to make sure you are opted in for beta. I doubt the actual beta will start for several weeks though. Also your dragon signature thing is massively screwed up and isn't in your signature.</div></div><hr />

1. How many people opted in?<br />
2. How many people were included?<br />
3. How long did it take to go from beta invites to game release? (I know Lich King came out early/mid November, and I post declaring that invites were going out in mid July, but idk if the invite post is accurate)<br />
4. If anybody here was in the WotLK beta, what did it include? Just stress tests and finishing touches, or were things actually very broken and needed fixing?<br />

<br />
People who think the Alpha was only on for 2 weeks fooled themselves, the Alpha has been going on for over 6 months or more. Just becasue they announced it doesn't mean its not been going on internally (which it has) for quite some time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I've been in all the betas, and I never experienced big latency problems. Zones crashing constantly? Definitely. Not so much with the latency though.<br />
<br />
As far as ruining the first experience, yes and no. You'll still get a cool first experience, it just won't be at the same time that non beta folks get it (when it first goes live). On the other hand, if you're an &quot;achiever&quot; type and can stand leveling twice, you can get a big leg up by being in beta and learning the ropes for new quests and systems before they're live.<br />
<br />
Probably the most valuable thing I got from Wrath beta was the realization that I should start out playing my druid alt rather than my warlock main when wrath launched. The warlock is fine now, but I might have quit WoW altogether if I'd been counting on the lock being good for S5 PvP.</div></div><hr />

With death of the former lich king it's possible that more undead broke out from his will and regained their own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the past you have needed an active account, but I know of a few people who got into the SC2 beta and the only game on their account was a cancelled WoW trial. So it's possible that people will get into Cata beta without an active WoW account.</div></div><hr />

Mark my words. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why would we mark your words? have they been especially credible in the past?<br />
<br />
Last few betas they have reminded people to opt in/update their specs at least a month before beta started. By that standard, you are being entirely too optimistic.<br />
<br />
Plus, this is Blizzard. How often do you think they meet an internal deadline? Even if their goal was to start open beta in two weeks, chances are it would take longer.</div></div><hr />

You check the box for the franchise(s) you're interested in:<br />
<br />
Diablo<br />
Starcraft<br />
Warcraft</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm fairly sure just ticking the Warcraft box will opt you in for Cata beta. :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, yay for beta! Wasn't expecting them to talk about it so soon after alpha. And now... *crosses fingers*<br />
<br />
edit: I wonder if this opt in is for US players only for now though... There are no news about this on the EU site. :(</div></div><hr />

Opt-in for Wrath Beta opened on July 3/4 2008. This was before Battle.NET, so they had to build a pool of people before they started sending invites. Because of Battle.NET, you've been able to opt-in since they brought up the Battle.NET system last year. So Wrath opt-in started July 3/4. When did Wrath Beta open? July 18th, a mere two weeks later.<br />
<br />
So, if anything (thanks to A LOT of people already having opted in), it will take LESS time to go from an opt-in &quot;reminder&quot; to actually bringing the beta up with Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Opt-ins for the public beta began on July 3rd, 2008; the beta began on July 17th. On October 10th, Blizzard announced that Wrath of the Lich King had gone gold and discs were being manufactured for sale;[2] the game itself was released to the public on November 13, 2008. For the first time, the normal version of the game (as opposed to the Collector's Edition) was installable through one single DVD disc.&quot;<br />
<br />
If it follows the same pattern for Cataclysm we can expect:<br />
- beta to start in 2 weeks<br />
- cata going gold in september<br />
- cata released in october<br />
<br />
And it's not a coincidence that Blizzcon this year is in October....</div></div><hr />

If my memory serves me correctly pretty much everyone who opted in for Wrath got into the beta eventually.<br />
<br />
They send out waves of invites, starting with a small group and roughly each week they send out more to a larger number of people. Eventually everyone is in. Then they play it for a few hours and realise they're already bored and wait for retail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You normally need an active account on a specific day. That's how it worked for BC and WOTLK. They copy over the username/password database to the beta login server I suspect. Unless battlenet has changed that. Possible I suppose.</div></div><hr />

Looong time reader, first time poster. At first I'm going to warn that my english might be bit bad cause it, unfortunately, ain't my native language as you would say ::) <br />

In order to get email, any kind of email from Blizzard you must sign to Blizzard's newsletter, which you can do in your Battle.net account by pressing &quot;Communication Preferences.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. How many people opted in?<br />
2. How many people were included?<br />
3. How long did it take to go from beta invites to game release? (I know Lich King came out early/mid November, and I post declaring that invites were going out in mid July, but idk if the invite post is accurate)<br />
4. If anybody here was in the WotLK beta, what did it include? Just stress tests and finishing touches, or were things actually very broken and needed fixing?<br />
<br />
I suppose if anyone knows these about the BC beta as well, we could try and predict the Cata beta stats. idk<br />
<br />
<br />
I participated in WotlK Beta and let me go over what is really important (Blizzard point of view):<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard wants enough people to get in the beta mainly for testing purposes. Not even half the amount of people that Opted-In will be invited, but don't worry. You will still have the opportunity to actually buy the xpac and play it when released... ::)<br />
Invites are done through waves. If not enough people are testing content then they will invite more.<br />
Blizzard wants enough people to test Questing, PvP, Raids, and new features.<br />
Beta is divided through phases to properly test all content: (Phase 1) low-medium amount of people to test questing and some other leveling specific content (world phasing for example), (Phase 2) medium-high amount of people to test on dungeons and raids, blizz also wants hardcore raiders to focus test on raids and specific boss-mechanics, (Phase 3) Last part and it focuses on stress test: This is generally the part with most players and it mainly focuses in class balance, pvp and lag.<br />
Beta will likely last 3 to 4 months.<br />
Last but not least: it is beta and so it will have bugs. Some of them being broken quests, unbeatable bosses, overpowered classes and skills, client crash errors, graphical bugs and what not. Beta =/= Demo with that being said fixing critical bugs is a core aspect of beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll probably get an email and when you log into your B.net account you'll see a small icon with Deathwing's face and a text reading &quot;World of Warcraft: Cataclysm (beta)&quot; in the same area where you have your registered Blizzard games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They will definitely invite a lot more people over the course of Beta, even more at the stress test portion. The point is if you don't get invited in the first wave then you might still have a chance at later stages of beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same here.<br />
<br />
I just went in to look if my system specs are still up to date, and notice SC2 beta being there, ready to download.<br />
It wasn't there the last time I looked (~1 week ago), and even though I have checked blizzard newsletter I have not received a notification about the SC2 beta invite.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks boub for posting this and making me check my account, otherwise it'd have been 1-2 more weeks before I'd have checked my bnet account again. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now I can start Starcraftin earlier.<br />
Which is kind of interesting... I used to never get any beta invites, but this year I had three (STO, C&amp;C4 and now SC2), seems like 2010 is my year :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
@all the people:<br />
I'm pretty sure you do not need an ACTIVE wotlk subscription for an invite.<br />
It says &quot;you’ll need a World of Warcraft license attached to your Battle.net account&quot;, even an inactive vanilla account would fulfill this requirement.<br />
<br />
MAYBE people with active subs have higher chances of getting in, but according to this blue post being invited with an inactive account is possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You cannot see the new phasing and zones without Cat, which I am sure needs you to upgrade from WotLK. What would be the point to let in people who cannot even test the content? I am sure you need an active WotLK account.</div></div><hr />

Just means that you have bought atleast the original World of Warcraft and you have used the key associated with that game on your battle.net account. If you log in to that account on the site and you see any World of Warcraft &quot;poster&quot; under your games section, that means you have a WoW License.</div></div><hr />

They are doing opt-in differently this time, an opt-in on Battlenet as opposed to a page on the WoW site. That said, the reminder to opt-in could easily be seen as a parallel to them putting up the opt-in page for the Lich King and Burning Crusade Betas.

<br />
if an active account was required they would have stated that right next to that you need to have a WoW license attached to your battle.net account.</div></div><hr />

I think during the time they switched to the new battle.net This is just a reminder to do it.<br />
<br />
Please read my post carefully next time, ok? I said the &quot;reminder to opt-in&quot; could be a parallel to the opt-in pages being added to the web site for Burning Crusade and Lich King. They are not adding a new page for an opt-in this time, so a reminder could possibly be the equivalent of what that was in the past (as far as the development time frame is concerned).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
tell that to the people that got a TBC, and WotLK beta invite while having an inactive account. having an inactive account does not mean you are dead, and never go on the internet anymore. and if they were planning on only allowing people with active accounts be eligible then why allow people with inactive accounts opt in for it?</div></div><hr />

The Blasted Lands looks awesome! Any idea who that gronn is being chained in place? Can't wait to scale the world tree :) The water is still fricking amazing every time I see a ss with it!<br />
<br />
Any chance that people will forget about gearscore when Ruby Sanctum hits, or will we expect all pugs to ask for a 5500 GS and the instance completion achievement from day 1? :(</div></div><hr />

This.<br />
<br />
Dragging people back in through a beta invite (potentially making them pay for the game again after cataclysm is released) results in more $$ than inviting the ones who're already staying anyway (also, inviting someone with an active payment may make them freeze their real account until beta is over).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you had to explain the same thing over and over again to people daily, you'd run out of intelligent ways to dumb it down too.<br />
<br />
I swear if I see one more blue post explaining their thoughts on Warrior threat on aoe tanking...</div></div><hr />

Last beta (for WotLK) it had to not only be active but also in good standing. Meaning not suspended in any way due to account actions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has to be active and in good standing at the time.<br />
<br />
Here it is: http://www.mmo-champion.com/general-discussions-22/what-a-real-beta-invite-looks-like/<br />
<br />
<br />
-Please be prepared to enter the current retail World of Warcraft account name and password you use, and the appropriate beta code listed below to authenticate your eligibility to connect to the Wrath of the Lich King test realms. To participate in the beta tests, you must have a valid retail World of Warcraft account active and in good standing as of July 15, 2008. Below is a beta code that will allow you to upgrade the Account you use to play World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade. Each beta code can be used only once to upgrade an active retail World of Warcraft account.<br />
<br />
I got in too, and I'd been inactive for a good few months. Happen to resub at just the right time. :P :-*</div></div><hr />

My only question is, do forum bans count against a person for a beta invite?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Forum bans have nothing to do with your account (vice versa though, account bans do result in lack of forum access, but that's just a side effect)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or you could be me. Get a key and have it say it is already in use when you go to use it. On the FIRST wave of invites. After a week contacting Blizzard giving proof I was told the only thing they could do was re-opt me in. Guess who never got another key? Yep!</div></div><hr />
