They buffed the overall numbers it will do up front but decrease the amount of dmg it gets from secondaries I'm pretty sure, so it is actually a buff in hindsight, as the dmg will scale with your weapons rather than stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So basically every single spec has passives that are invisible to normal players, usually 2, there are some exceptions (Fury Warr). One passive has a certain % on all your abilities what healing/damage they do, that's why specs that have the same spell (Ele, Resto shaman) do different damage with their spells, 90% of the time they are fidgeting with these when they are balancing specs...HOWEVER. With BFA, because I haven't seen these before they seem to have added added a -% for all specs to certain spells/effects they have. The patch notes here largely consist of these -% begind adjusted, e.g. a spec goes from -16% to -12%, that's 4% more damage/healing they do, it's just worded retardedly. <br />
<br />
And no, Ret didn't get a buff so stop whining about that, the talent they buffed was almost used by noone and they even nerfed Inquisition which the majority of people used in a vain hope, some will go over to using the other one (spoiler: they won't) . In an Expac where GCD is nerfed to the ground and specifically because of this there is almost no haste on gear you bet your ass that everyone will take the Haste increase instead of some random RNG. But hey DKs got nerfed, cause you know, fuck'em some more in case anyone decides to play them.</div></div><hr />

Yes, thank you. I am very proud of my intern status and IQ of 12. Also, I'm fairly sure you accidentally your verb there, just like I did in this sentence.<br />
<br />
On a serious note, it is very hard to word negative percent changes. Both methods look wrong:<br />
A. Damage bonus for all abilities increased from -20% to -15%.<br />
B. Damage penalty for all abilities decreased from -20% to -15%.<br />
<br />
There were a lot of objections to style A, so I changed it to style B and there are a lot of objections to that as well. Perhaps for the future, the best way to word it is to say something relative using percent change, like:<br />
C. Damage bonus for all abilities increased by 25% (from -20% to -15%).<br />
D. Damage multiplier for all abilities increased by 6.25% (value went from -20% to -15%).<br />
<br />
Alternatively, something removing the negative numbers by considering the base value of 100% could work, like this:<br />
E. Damage multiplier for all abilities increased from 80% to 85%.<br />
F. Damage multiplier for all abilities increased by 6.25% (from 80% to 85%).<br />
G. Damage multiplier for all abilities increased from 0.8 to 0.85.<br />
H. Damage multiplier for all abilities increased by 6.25% (from 0.8 to 0.85).<br />

It's well written , people just have to not have pea for brain to understand it . It's a wordplay, so instead of rushing through and seeing only numbers , take your time and read what those numbers mean.<br />
While a plain relative percentage would be more readable , it's also useful to see what the previous aura modifier was , and what it is now.</div></div><hr />

I haven't messed around with enhance and ret to make any comments on that, but as far as demo goes, the nerf to Destro actually should bring it line (or at least close to in line) with Demonology now - close enough to be balanced. Suggests that Demo's post nerf DPS is the baseline that they are after initially.</div></div><hr />

I think when using the word &quot;penalty&quot; you don't need the -, because it becomes a double negative. A penalty of -20% is actually a 20% increase. You would just say &quot;the damage penalty has been decreased from 20% to 15%&quot;</div></div><hr />

-27 is a smaller number than -23 so it is a 4% nerf</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Its a higher negative, therefor its 4%nerf. Try to look at it this way.<br />
When we take into consideration all formulas that make a spell its base damage is theoretical 0% because no changes are applied to it.<br />
<br />
However, since Legion Blizzard introduced &quot;Aura buffs&quot; which are invisible by players and they modify specific spells damage by certain %. These Auras usually have multiple spells which they modify.<br />
That being said +% Aura increases base spell damage by said +% on top of its base (theoretical 0%)<br />
Similar thing applies to -% Aura which reduces base damage of spell by said -% from its base (theoretical 0%). <br />
Its simple as that.<br />
<br />
However this this gets funky when -% values are in question, so from base damage (theoretical 0%) -% is considered a nerf, however if theres a change in it and that -% is lessen (smaller number than before) its considered as &quot;buff&quot; because its a less of a nerf.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
-30% &lt;&lt; -20% &lt;&lt; base spell damage (Theoretical 0%) &gt;&gt; +20% &gt;&gt; + 30%<br />
<br />
In this case positive values are clear:<br />
0 + 20% = + 20% so its a 20% buff.<br />
0 + 30% = + 30% so its a 30% buff. And its a +10% buff on previous 20% buff.<br />
<br />
Negative values are as follows:<br />
<br />
0 - 30% = - 30% so its a -30% nerf on its base damage (theoretical 0%)<br />
0 - 20% = - 20% so its a -20% nerf on its base damage (theoretical 0%)<br />
<br />
However, if we look at -20% value, as -30% is more negative than -20% it is actually a 10% buff because base damage (Theoretical 0%) is less reduced by -20% than -30%.<br />
<br />
Hope that it helps clarifying things a bit. My eng is not a native language so im unable to explain it better.<br />
<br />
TL;DL - look at it as X axis on XY graph, the less negative it is from its previous negative value its actually a buff because its closer to base spell damage (theoretical 0%)</div></div><hr />

The penalty from -23% is now -27%. That means the penalty is now 4% less (because it's negative)? So that is a 4% buff?<br />
<br />
-27 is below -23 as you'll learn once you take 4th grade math.</div></div><hr />
