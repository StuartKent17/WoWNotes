Cataclysm Prologue - Gnomeregan and the Echo Isles (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/cataclysm-prologue-gnomeregan-and-the-echo-isles/)<br />
<br />
High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque: The Liberation of Gnomeregan<br />
Gelbin Mekkatorque is known as much for his technical brilliance as he is for his just leadership of the gnomes. In addition to being elected high tinker, the most prominent rank in gnomish society, Gelbin proved himself to be an inventor without equal by leading the construction of the Deeprun Tram, which links Stormwind and Ironforge. Yet all of the high tinker's achievements have been overshadowed by one catastrophic event that occurred under his rule: the fall of Gnomeregan.<br />
<br />
Around the time of the Third War, an ancient menace known as the troggs surfaced in Gnomeregan from the depths of Azeroth. This barbaric race, thought to have been unintentionally released during the Uldaman excavation, crushed the gnomes' defenses and became entrenched in the lower sections of the city. Gelbin, for all his genius, was at a loss for a way to eradicate the savage invaders until his chief advisor, Mekgineer Sicco Thermaplugg, proposed that they inundate Gnomeregan with toxic radiation.<br />
<br />
Confident in Thermaplugg's radical plan, Mekkatorque gave the order to irradiate the city. This bold move worked at first: toxic radiation spread throughout Gnomeregan and momentarily stopped the troggs' incursion. Soon, however, it was evident that the radiation was killing gnomes as well as troggs. In the end, nearly eighty percent of the gnomish race died, and many of those who survived were mutated into deranged leper gnomes. To add to the tragedy, the troggs then resumed their assault on the city.<br />
<br />
Mekkatorque and the healthy survivors evacuated Gnomeregan and were taken in by the dwarves of neighboring Ironforge, but Thermaplugg disappeared. The high tinker later learned troubling news that his former advisor had seized control of the toxic gnomish city and instated himself as its twisted overlord. Much to Mekkatorque's shock, he also discovered that Thermaplugg had secretly desired the office of high tinker and might have been previously aware of or even complicit in the trogg invasion.<br />
<br />
The immense loss of life at Gnomeregan weighed heavy on Mekkatorque's shoulders, and in his fury he ordered the death of Thermaplugg. A band of heroes took up the mission and returned with a tale of victory, but after analyzing the claim, Mekkatorque realized that the mechanized overlord defeated in the depths of the city was likely nothing more than a cleverly engineered facsimile of Thermaplugg.<br />
<br />
Aware that defeating his nemesis would require a more robust approach, Mekkatorque labored over strategies to retake his city. His tireless brainstorming recently paid off with Operation: Gnomeregan, a brilliant multi-phased assault plan to liberate the gnomish capital and bring the real Thermaplugg to justice. With the operation set to begin, resourceful gnomes such as &quot;Doc&quot; Cogspin, Captain Tread Sparknozzle, and Drill Sergeant Steamcrank have been overseeing preparations and fine-tuning new technology that will be vital to the offensive.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mekkatorque has begun rounding up all able-bodied gnomes to join in the attack, and his call to arms has also been heard by other members of the Alliance. The gnomes' techno-savvy has been vital in past conflicts, and many Alliance heroes are likely to join the offensive to recapture the extraordinary inventions within the fallen city. For Mekkatorque, however, his plan goes beyond just reacquiring lost technology. The retaking of Gnomeregan will determine his legacy in history, either as the high tinker who lost the gnomes' beloved capital, or the one who reestablished it as the center of innovation on Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Operation: Gnomeregan is now. <br />

<br />
Vol'jin: The Glory of the Darkspears<br />
Most of Azeroth's savage trolls are infamous for their extreme hatred of other races, but the Darkspear tribe and its leader, Vol'jin, are an exception. Over the years, the Darkspears have proven to be invaluable members of the Horde. Vol'jin in particular is known to offer strategic advice to Warchief Thrall on a regular basis, and the cunning troll played a role in retaking the Undercity after it was overthrown by the rebel forces of Varimathras and Putress.<br />
<br />
Yet for all of the tribe's accomplishments, the Darkspears are still plagued by a tragic history of exile. Long ago they were driven from Stranglethorn Vale's mainland by the more powerful trolls of the Gurubashi empire and then settled on a remote island. The Darkspears later sought refuge with the Horde when their isle was destroyed by a mysterious sea witch, and Thrall granted the trolls new lands on the Echo Isles off the coast of Durotar. Aside from a brief exodus when Daelin Proudmoore's fleet arrived to hunt down orcs, the Darkspears enjoyed relative stability until one of their own, Zalazane, drove his brethren from their latest home.<br />
<br />
The witch doctor Zalazane had been one of the tribe's leading mystical instructors when he was inexplicably driven to insanity by the powers under his control. Utilizing dark magic, he enslaved many of his fellow tribespeople and amassed an army of mindless Darkspear trolls. Fearing that all of his tribe would come under Zalazane's sway, Vol'jin ordered the remaining free Darkspears to abandon the Echo Isles.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin's Darkspears settled in nearby Sen'jin Village, which they have since used as a staging point to attack Zalazane. Over the years, members of the Horde looking to test their worth have braved the Echo Isles to confront Zalazane, and many of them even returned victorious with his severed head. These victories, however, proved to be nothing more than an illusion created by the twisted witch doctor's dark magic. Days after these trophies were taken to Sen'jin Village, they reverted to their true forms: painted rocks and coconuts adorned with wooden tusks, or even the heads of Zalazane's enslaved trolls.<br />
<br />
Despite these setbacks and his preoccupation with advising Thrall on Horde-related matters, Vol'jin has spent considerable time formulating a strategy to recapture the Echo Isles. Now he believes that the time to strike at Zalazane has come. As the Darkspear leader and his close allies Vanira and Champion Uru'zin await approval of their plan from the ancestral spirits, they have begun rounding up new troll recruits and staging reconnaissance missions to learn about Zalazane's minions.<br />
<br />
Yet Vol'jin's trolls are short on forces, and the enslaved Darkspears on the Echo Isles outnumber them. The Darkspears are well-known for being among Azeroth's bravest combatants, however, and fortunately many non-trolls have expressed interest in assisting Vol'jin, perhaps hoping that restoring the Echo Isles will eventually bolster the Horde's strength.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin is also aware of the strategic importance that a Darkspear homeland offers his allies, but he is motivated by more personal reasons. Zalazane's betrayal was an affront against Vol'jin's dream of a better life for his tribe, a destiny that his late father, Sen'jin, envisioned years ago. Only by retaking the Echo Isles will Vol'jin be able to honor his father and at long last secure a permanent homeland for the long-exiled Darkspear tribe. <br />

Actually, 4.0 is the Pre-Cata patch that will introduce Archaeology, (some of the) Titan Path system, new class changes, the Cataclysm itself (most likely), etc. 4.0.1 or 4.0.2 will be Cataclysm itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4.0 being the Cataclysm systems patch (that normally comes 1 month before the real patch)<br />
<br />
but Blizzard made the Pre-Cata event SO EPIC that they had to make a major content patch for it. And knowing that in 4.0 &quot;everyone&quot; will have the new Azeroth, the fact of splitting it in multiple major patches works, because i certainly dont want to download a massive 5gb patch anytime soon, for sure.<br />
<br />
They probably COULD name it 3.4, but Pre-Cata patch is basically Pre-4.0, and what comes before 4.0? 3.9 of course. 3.4 is too far from 4.0</div></div><hr />

Like other people have been saying, 4.0 is not Cataclysm. It'll be the patch applied to LK that implements all the changes for Cataclysm, but prior to release of the expansion.<br />

i think blizz said there would be no 3.4. And as such they are skipping that number. 3.5 Ruby Sanctum, 3.9 Gnomergan, and they are probably using 3.9 as a &quot;THIS IS THE LAST THING BEFORE CATA&quot; kind of thing.</div></div><hr />

Nothing, unless otherwise state. Prologue; like a book, events to get you ready for Cata. Version numbers are strictly version numbers, like in the previous expansions. Sunwell was 2.4, Wrath patch was 3.0, nothing happened in between with respect to version numbers.</div></div><hr />

This. I always thought that the seemingly commonly held idea that 4.0 with all the azeroth cataclysm change would be released one month before the actual xpack didn't make sense. A 3.9 patch with the game mechanic changes but not the content change makes lotsof sense.<br />
So basically 3.9 will be to cataclysm what 3.0 was to WotLK and what 2.0 was to TBC.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">subanark</div><div class="date">2010-03-17, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The good old marketing of version numbers. 3.9 is advertised as simply being before 4.0, although such numbering is arbitrary. If they got up to 3.9 naturally and wanted another content patch it would be 3.10, then 3.11, and so on. I mean if they knew for sure that they had 1 major content patch before 4.0, they could call it 4.-1, but that would just seem weird.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cookiez</div><div class="date">2010-03-17, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They can, and probably will go from 3.3 to 3.9.<br />
<br />
4.0 being the Cataclysm systems patch (that normally comes 1 month before the real patch)<br />
<br />
but Blizzard made the Pre-Cata event SO EPIC that they had to make a major content patch for it. And knowing that in 4.0 &quot;everyone&quot; will have the new Azeroth, the fact of splitting it in multiple major patches works, because i certainly dont want to download a massive 5gb patch anytime soon, for sure.<br />
<br />
They probably COULD name it 3.4, but Pre-Cata patch is basically Pre-4.0, and what comes before 4.0? 3.9 of course. 3.4 is too far from 4.0<br />
<br />
<br />
I honestly wish people would stop saying they are going to skip numbers. When have they skipped numbers in the past DURING an expansion? Yes they skip from last patch to the pre-expansion release.. aka 1.12 to 2.0, 2.4 to 3.0, but not actually during an expansion.<br />
<br />
I do admit this could be a place-holder number until they decide what patch it will go into live.</div></div><hr />

Doubt they will do that! What if there is a major bug with that patch? Remember the paladin crusader strike nerf after 2.0 and the paladin DivineStorm nerf after 3.0? I think 4.0 will be released before cata jsut to see how the abilities work ingame. So that when going for &quot;server first lvl 85&quot; all classes get equall chances rather then having 1 class with OP abilities at the start of an expac....they will prolly have it out b4 cata expac to balance it before they raise the levelcap</div></div><hr />

Seriously guys, they throw out &quot;3.9&quot; and suddenly everyone assumes the Cata release timetable has been delayed, and/or there will be content in between 3.3.5 and 3.9. I never got the copy of the memo from Blizzard stating they would absolutely never skip over version numbers. Could I get one of you to send that my way?

<br />
This is pre-Cataclysm. I don't understand where the confusion is coming from.<br />
<br />
Like someone previously posted...<br />
x.y.z: x refers to game version (ie: 1 = Vanilla, 2 = TBC and 3 = WotLK), y refers to major content patch (ie: 2.3 = Zul'Aman and 2.4 = Sunwell) and the z refers to a minor patch that usually contains small fixes and updates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You're not making sense. Version numbers are just arbitrary sequence of numbers, they don't have to be consecutive or follow a rigid scheme. Version numbers are just names arbitrarily assigned to a build of the game and the only convention they really follow is that they are ordered numerically.<br />
<br />
Anyway, 3.9 does make a lot of sense because unlike 2.0 and 3.0, a huge portion of the content of the new xpack will be available also for people who don't have cataclysm. So the only way they can prepare the servers in advance for cataclysm without making the new azeroth available before the actual cataclysm release date is to make an &quot;almost 4.0&quot; patch (ie 3.9) which will probably contain the class changes, gear change etc. but not the new azeroth yet.<br />
<br />
It should be quite obvious that it doesn't mean there will be a 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.</div></div><hr />

You don't know anything about release time-tables. There's a good chance that they mean 3.3.9.<br />
<br />
There's a good chance that 3.9 will be the pre-expansion patch. Just because they did 2.0 and 3.0 as pre-expansion mechanic change patches, doesn't mean that they'll make 4.0 the same.<br />
<br />
Perhaps, since the pre-expansion patch is still actually in this expansion, they thought it would make more sense to name it 3.9.<br />
<br />
If the above two paragraphs are correct, 4.0 will be the content you install with the Cataclysm install disc.<br />
<br />
I still believe that Cataclysm will launch in mid-Summer.<br />
<br />
And to whomever said, &quot;We'll get Starcraft around Christmas 2010&quot;.... there is no way in HELL Blizzard would leave a game in Beta for 9-10 months. I forsee Starcraft in the next 2 months.. Cataclysm in the next 5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must have a jump to conclusions mat or something. They stated in the last Blizzcast that their original goal for the beta was for it to be 5 months but it will be closer to 3 since they want to get Starcraft 2 out in the first half of this year. I would not be surprised with a 3rd quarter Cataclysm release.</div></div><hr />

Where were the 5 content patches between sunwell and wotlk??? ::)<br />
Where do you get the idea of being forced to go 3.1 - 3.2 - 3.3 and so on? In classic wow it even got over 10, last patch was 1.12. There could basically be a 3.5741 if blizzard wants it. Stooop writing bullshit :(</div></div><hr />

And what patch system are you talking about. Definitly not that one they used in WoW. Because if you think that there is any system behind this except x.y(.z) where x is an expansion, y is a content patch and z is a fix but no other rule behind it...you're wrong</div></div><hr />

To explain where the &quot;3.9&quot; comes from. Still doesn't change my opinion that will come in 3.3.3. Everything is on the PTR and Blizz don't release lore pages without the content being release very soon.<br />

yeah .... 1.12 to 2.0, 2.4 to 3.0 etc ... srsly :P<br />
<br />
Best bet is that they'll change the x.0 system for the new pre expansion content patch cos they will not be introducing the whole new azeroth at the same time of the preview of talents and stuff .. that will not even make sense, what else u will buy the dvd for in the 1st place? :P<br />
<br />
3.9 cata data content and this thingies, 4.0 cata disk with new azeroth.<br />
<br />
Who the fuck want another 6 content patches? Wrath of the Lich King is closed since the Lich King is dead ....<br />

3.4 .... Bolvar goin fuzzy lets go and kill him .... new lk again<br />
3.5 new lk goin crazy! lets kill another ... new lk again<br />

I really wonder what is it with wow players always trying to find repetitive patterns in everything blizzard do even for things for which there's absolutely no rational or sensible reason at all for such a pattern to actually exist.<br />
<br />
Also, the situation where they need a prelude patch to a major content patch probably never happened before. Cataclysm needs it to solve the issue of preparing the servers/game for cataclysm without unveiling the content before the actual release date, that's a situation that never happened before and there's no reason they'd not call the prelude patch 3.9 just for the sake of keeping their version number consistent.<br />
<br />
It has no need for consistence, only anal-retentive nerds would consider it important that the version numbers keep getting incremented in a specific way.<br />

Yet, you miss two facts.<br />

Deathwing emerges from Deepholme, raining destruction and death down from the skies. His first targets are the newly built and innadequately defensed Gnomeragan and Echo Isles. Aid the trolls and gnomes in their quest to sneak back into their once adoptive homelands.<br />

<br />
^^^ this<br />
<br />
and I don' think people are understanding how the patches are working. Everything is based on previous blizzard patches and expansions, they could always change up there patching but this is how it has been since the dawn of time.<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
3.3.3 is the upcoming patch most likely due out Tuesday<br />
3.3.4 is ?? not sure whats going on with this one<br />
3.3.5 is Ruby Sanctum<br />
3.9 is pre-patch before the actual release of cataclysm (everything that is going to be changed even if you don't buy cataclysm)<br />
4.0 is Cataclysm<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Now based on personal reading and thoughts, I would suspect the dates for all this to go something like<br />
3.3.3 = 3/23/10<br />
3.3.4 = End of April<br />
3.3.5 = May<br />
Cataclysm Beta = July/August<br />
3.9 = July/August<br />
4.0 = October/November<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />

Clone gnomes and voodoo illusions are not that farfetched. They are already in game (the gnome girl that is duplicated because of a teleporter malfunction in Northrend, for example).</div></div><hr />

well gnomeran was a dungeon and it has more &quot;in game &quot; lore than the echo islands, so gnomrean is more knowed than a zone where the low level orcs and trolls have some quest (i start one troll shamman some time ago, and i never was there).<br />

Yes, the numbering system I've picked is entirely arbitrary, and the only reason I used that is their original plan may have been 4 major patches (3.0,3.1,3.2,3.3), each with 2 'stages' then part 9 being pre-cata story.<br />
<br />
As far as I've seen anywhere, there's no explicit mention to &quot;patch 3.9&quot;, just to 3p9 in the URL... I dunno, think the tl;dr of this is that we don't know that 3p9=3.9, there could be a different (potentially internal) meaning to it...<br />
<br />
Given that the under dev page is now up, I wouldn't be suprised if it came before or in the same patch as Ruby Sanctum (doubtful on 3.3.3 given there's been no sign on the PTR, and 3.3.4 is unlikely I guess...). Ah, I'm rambling. ???<br />

<br />
Because it's nothing to do with decimals. It's just a numbering system. 1.12 was the 12th major patch of 1.0. 3.3.3 is the third minor patch of the third major patch of the third version of the game.<br />
<br />
All of the speculation and debate is just as arbitrary as the numbering system. While it makes no sense for Blizzard to stop using their current numbering system and introduce a &quot;3.9&quot; just to make a pre-pre-Cataclysm patch, it also makes no sense that there will be 6 major patches until Cataclysm. So, either &quot;3.9&quot; is a mistake, possible &quot;3.3.9&quot;, or Blizzard has just decided to make a new numbering system, with &quot;X.9&quot; as a precursor patch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kraeden</div><div class="date">2010-03-17, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3.9 pretty much means that Cataclysm will not be coming in 2010.

<br />
Haha no.<br />
<br />
Starcraft beta is expected to between 3 and 5 months, and it's a month old already. So between mid may and mid july for Starcraft 2.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm will be close behind, probably August or something. Activision Blizzard said both will come out this year in their yearly schedule/plan/announcement thing, but it's obvious anyway.</div></div><hr />

World of Warcraft was released as version 1.1.0<br />
<br />
WoWwiki shows patch 3.3.5 followed by 3.9 ... I agree that numbering system goes against what Blizzard has done in the past, but these patch versions are completely up to them and they can change the system as they see fit. They could name the next patch 3.B1Q if they choose to.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to Cataclysm too, but it'll get here when it does... getting hyped up won't change it. I think that MMO Champion should hold a contest to see who can predict the release date and everyone has to stick to their first guess. Personally I'm going to say September 14th. I just hope I don't have to stand in the cold again to get the game at midnight!!! :-)</div></div><hr />

Yeah Blizzard still knows where to cop be... inspired. Just like in the old days when this whole merchandise was created. When in doubt - look elsewhere for input.<br />
<br />
In other news, the whole redoing of old stuff is starting to wear my motivation to keep on playing down severely.<br />
<br />
When Naxx II was announced I thought - oh well, given that we were the only raid on our server to have set foot in there its ok to make it accessible to others now, the encounters and all were quite cool.<br />
<br />
Then we got Ony II.<br />
<br />
And the blood princes...<br />
<br />
Ragnaros II announced for Cata<br />
<br />
DM II possibly including van Cleef II<br />
<br />
Now this stuff?<br />

It's people like you, who are the setbacks, methinks. On behalf of the non-members of your raid on your server, I thank you so much for your benevolent sharing of the Naxx content. :)<br />
<br />
The events and the later Gnomeregan instance have their place in the whole story. Beside that it's freaking important to give the city back to the Gnomes, so we can finally kick them out of Ironforge again. ;)<br />
<br />
As regards the version number and hopes for further content patches (3.x.0): Blizz stated earlier that there will not be any content patch 3.4 before Cata. Patch 3.3.5 (Ruby Sanctum) will be the last major content release before the Addon.<br />
<br />
We'll see...</div></div><hr />

Personally I just pugged it at 70. Surprisingly easy to find raids of 40 people who were exalted with the argent dawn and only 3-8 people had done it at 60.<br />

I do like the idea of gnomes getting their own city back, and even trolls can finally move out of org and go live in their wooden huts and whatnot.<br />
<br />
But the zalezane and thermaplugg thing made me a little... meh.<br />
What would stop now from any other major character in wow to suddenly re-emerge? Hey, it was just an illusion? &quot;But we braught you his head as proof that he is dead!&quot; -you say? think again! It was just a rock disguised as a head!<br />

Nah... They were busy making Obsidian Sanctum, Malygos, Ulduar, Trail of the Crusader, Vault of Archavon and Icecrown Citadel.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the continent of Northrend.<br />
<br />
<br />
And then they went on to re-build most of Azeroth for the upcoming Cataclysm, made Deepholme and the city of the Naga. And then went on to make Gilneas, Tol Barad and Uldum.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ExarKun</div><div class="date">2010-03-18, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not read all the pages but here's some info about how the patches went in TBC:<br />
<br />
The Burning Crusade has thus far received four major content patches. The patch release schedule is radically different from the original World of Warcraft - content is introduced in large chunks, and balancing fixes are often added as separate minor patches between the content patches.<br />
<br />
* Patch 2.1 introduced daily quests (and the relevant Netherwing/Ogri'la /Skyguard zones such as Skettis) and the Black Temple 25-man raid content. It can also be argued that this patch unlocked the Hyjal wing of the Caverns of Time, since prior to 2.1, Kael'Thas and Lady Vashj would only drop a limited number of attunement vials to Hyjal per kill, requiring several months of farming prior to fielding a 25-man raid into Hyjal.<br />
<br />
* Patch 2.2 introduces voice communications software built into the game client (as well as video recording for Mac clients).<br />
<br />
* Patch 2.3 introduces the Zul'Aman 10-man raid instance and leveling improvements for levels 20-60.<br />
<br />
* Patch 2.4 introduces the Isle of Quel'Danas, a new outdoor zone which includes the Magisters' Terrace, a 5-man instance, and the Sunwell Plateau, a 25-man raid. Also included are Combat Log improvements and the introduction of a global Arena Tournament realm. <br />
<br />
(shameless copypaste from Wowwiki)<br />
<br />
It goes just like it did in TBC and the 3.9 is the right patch number</div></div><hr />

<br />
the gnomes are like a &quot;genius&quot; roommate (Gelbin) that was only supposed to crash for a couple days and as they moved more and more of their shit and a couple buddies in (more gnomes). That turned into weeks, months, then years.<br />
They got kicked out of their apartment (Gnomer), in the same building as you (Dun Morogh), by a homeless toddler (troggs). To get their apartment back they essentially flea-bombed the the homeless kid And their kids they left behind giving them all leprosy. Turns out, the gnome's wife (Sicco) was the one that invited that kid over to stay in the first place and bought the flea-bombs.<br />
So now, they plan on rounding up everyone in the building (and probably everyone in the entire complex (Alliance)) to go kick the shit out of some rampant toddlers? <br />
.... <br />
someone mentioned that it'd be cool for there to be an event to take back Gnomer and the troll island and it's probably faction exclusive... problem is, I don't think anyone but gnomes give a shit about the gnomes or their homeland. I can see people wanting to help out to get them the fuck outta IF and then RE-Raiding Gnomer if they don't wanna pay for 5 years of back-rent (Fucking free-loaders.) At least the trolls were Trying to take their island back. The gnomes couldn't boot down the door and wail on a few 4 year olds, they stuck around in IF for HALF A DECADE. <br />
While several lowbies and one 80 would mow through that place for a couple things and split, the gnomes are finally deciding to form A RAID on this place....<br />
<br />
The Alliance should re-gas the place with the proper toxicity (pfft. &quot;in all his genius&quot; did you read that shit??) as soon as the remaining gnomes are in there and seal it off, or at least tip off the Horde they're all gonna be in there, while we help them get their island back</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That does make a lot more sense. The jump from 3.3.x where are now, to 3.9 is pretty huge, unless they are churning out constant major content patches, in a fairly short amount of time. 3.3 - 3.9 does imply six major patches, which I think it unlikely.<br />
<br />
I would've expected 3.4 (maybe 3.5) to kick of the prologue in ernest, and then they could jump to 4.0 when they were ready. As people have said they do skip numbers and thats all well and good, but do they frequently skip 6 places? (from 3.3-3.9) thats just weird.<br />
<br />
Do we think that 3.9 is the start of the bulk of the prologue event, or do we think it will have already started before that? I say 'bulk' of, because technically its already begun.</div></div><hr />

In patch 5.0 we will learn that during all those times we were in the Emerald Dream fighting the nightmare, so in fact when we will wake up all the old boss we killed (<br />
-C'Thun,<br />
-Kael'thas Sunstrider version 1 and version 2,<br />
-Lady Vash,<br />
-Illidan,<br />
-Kil'jaeden,<br />
<br />
-Kel'Thuzad, Yogg-Saron and Arthas...etc)<br />

<br />
That is all.<br />
<br />
PS: Considering that the event is already on the PTR build files (music, voices and all) AND Blizz doesn't make lore pages for far reaching patches, it's easy to predict that will come in 3.3.3.<br />
<br />
You are saying that Blizz will ignore and abandon their 15 years old patch system? After 3.3 is 4.0.<br />
<br />
Well I read several of your follow-on posts too, but w/e. You're getting into the weeds and missing the point of my post. Versioning is arbitrary. They can call this patch 3.9 or 3.3.9 or 3.9.14159265... It doesn't matter. The number is arbitrary. You cannot make reasonable predictions of release time based on version numbers other than to say that 3.3.x is likely to come before 3.y for values of y &gt; 3. Even then companies have been known to break sequences. As for your contention that this will come before Ruby Sanctum... that seems unlikely. We already have details of Ruby Sanctum, this just has some quests and models in the PTR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet Vol'jin's trolls are short on forces, and the enslaved Darkspears on the Echo Isles outnumber them. The Darkspears are well-known for being among Azeroth's bravest combatants, however, [b]and fortunately many non-trolls have expressed interest in assisting Vol'jin, perhaps hoping that restoring the Echo Isles will eventually bolster the Horde's strength.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quests, models, spells, NPCs and music/voices. All the files needed for the events.<br />
<br />
And again, numbering is not arbitrary. It's (Game Version).(Major Content Version).(Minor Content Version).(Bugfix). This is the model used since Vanilla WoW, the one that finished on 1.12.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either it's 3.3.9 or they use 3.9 to launch it. There is no way they're going to launch 5 other patches after the main-boss of WotLK has been defeated.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, kicking off the event in patch 3.9 seems logical, as it would make sense that 4.0 would launch next. This doesn't fit with previous patch numbering though, but as they aren't going to get close to 10 major patches in an expansion anyways, this could possibly be how they're going to roll in the future.</div></div><hr />

The Alliance should re-gas the place with the proper toxicity (pfft. &quot;in all his genius&quot; did you read that shit??) as soon as the remaining gnomes are in there and seal it off, or at least tip off the Horde they're all gonna be in there, while we help them get their island back<br />

<br />
What? You're a Horde moron. The Trolls are even worse since they can't even clear out a bunch of level 7s off their islands.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riltia</div><div class="date">2010-03-18, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This. I always thought that the seemingly commonly held idea that 4.0 with all the azeroth cataclysm change would be released one month before the actual xpack didn't make sense. A 3.9 patch with the game mechanic changes but not the content change makes lotsof sense.<br />
So basically 3.9 will be to cataclysm what 3.0 was to WotLK and what 2.0 was to TBC.<br />
<br />
But that makes less sense than 3.3.5 &gt; 3.9, and I'll explain.<br />
Archaeology, for a start, will be heavily tied to the remake of Azeroth, so why would they implement it if it won't be usable?<br />
Yes, the guild changes might come before 4.0 but I would honestly just expect everything to come in a big 3.0-esque patch, just like what happened with WotLK. Look at the notes for 3.0.2 - Barber shops, Stormwind harbor, talent trees, calendar, achievements, removal of Dalaran. It all came in one big patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's the two facts combined, not just one.<br />
<br />
I can even accept the possibility of being on 3.3.9, but 3.9 doesn't fit on the system (Vanilla WoW had 1.10, 1.11 and 1.12)<br />
<br />
<br />
Why can you accept a jump from 3.3.3 to 3.3.9, but not a jump from 3.3 to 3.9? You are not being consistent here. As others sane ppl have already said, patch numbers are chosen to indicate the size and character of the changes, not merely a numeric counter.<br />
<br />
The bigger the upgrade, the bigger change (2.x to 3.0 &gt; 2.x to 2.y &gt; 2.x.y to 2.x.z). You can also do &quot;half steps, jump directly from say 5.1 to 5.5 to indicate that &quot;it's not big enough to jump to 6.0 but it is like a half full step so we go to two-and-a-half. many software companies and developers do that.<br />
<br />
In the case of 3.9, it is clearly to indicate that it is closer to 4.0 than 3.3, it's a Cataclysm prelude, not an ICC aftermath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You forgot patch 3.3.5. But it's also common the number to jump on minor revision patches, since it usually are internal builds that are jumped. For example, 3.0.0 jumped to 3.0.2.</div></div><hr />

too bad cataclysm probably won't be here for another year, any sooner and they might rush it and make it as shitty as Wrath of the gLItCH king.</div></div><hr />

So does this mean the trolls and the gnomes will get their own capitals? But wait, didn't Blizzard say that there would be no new capitals, or was I wrong? I know the worgen and goblin will be getting new districts...<br />
<br />
Anyways this is interesting news indeed, and especially since there has been an announcement for patch 3.9, I should start my account back up again :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daodan</div><div class="date">2010-03-19, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so this is the jest of it.<br />
<br />
the gnomes are like a &quot;genius&quot; roommate (Gelbin) that was only supposed to crash for a couple days and as they moved more and more of their shit and a couple buddies in (more gnomes). That turned into weeks, months, then years.<br />
They got kicked out of their apartment (Gnomer), in the same building as you (Dun Morogh), by a homeless toddler (troggs). To get their apartment back they essentially flea-bombed the the homeless kid And their kids they left behind giving them all leprosy. Turns out, the gnome's wife (Sicco) was the one that invited that kid over to stay in the first place and bought the flea-bombs.<br />
So now, they plan on rounding up everyone in the building (and probably everyone in the entire complex (Alliance)) to go kick the shit out of some rampant toddlers? <br />
.... <br />
someone mentioned that it'd be cool for there to be an event to take back Gnomer and the troll island and it's probably faction exclusive... problem is, I don't think anyone but gnomes give a shit about the gnomes or their homeland. I can see people wanting to help out to get them the fuck outta IF and then RE-Raiding Gnomer if they don't wanna pay for 5 years of back-rent (Fucking free-loaders.) At least the trolls were Trying to take their island back. The gnomes couldn't boot down the door and wail on a few 4 year olds, they stuck around in IF for HALF A DECADE. <br />
While several lowbies and one 80 would mow through that place for a couple things and split, the gnomes are finally deciding to form A RAID on this place....<br />
<br />
The Alliance should re-gas the place with the proper toxicity (pfft. &quot;in all his genius&quot; did you read that shit??) as soon as the remaining gnomes are in there and seal it off, or at least tip off the Horde they're all gonna be in there, while we help them get their island back<br />

<br />
is there unannounced 3.4/3.5/3.6/3.7/3.8<br />
<br />
do they just mean 3.3.9?<br />
<br />
and to anyone that says 'why can you accept that so easily'<br />
well who says they'll skip from 3.3.3 to 3.3.5, there could be some bugfix 3.3.4<br />
<br />
then it's just as easy to stretch the mind to the concept of 3.3.6/3.3.7/3.3.8...</div></div><hr />
