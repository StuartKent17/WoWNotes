Zone Screenshots<br />
The screenshots of the zones are without NPCs or doodads, this isn't representative of the final instance, just a preview of the architecture. Obviously a subzone like the Throne of Apocalypse is more impressive when Cho'gall is here sitting on his huge throne. <br />

UI Addon Functionality Returning<br />
With the release of the next beta patch, we plan to re-enable the ability for players to use third-party addons. Many of the core user interface features are now implemented in the beta test and functional, so we feel itâ€™s a good time to open up the field for developing and testing UI modifications.<br />
<br />
Be sure to continue leaving us feedback about all of the new user interface features here: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=26560766722&amp;sid=2000<br />
<br />
Feedback about the new guild interface can be provided to us here: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=26560766721&amp;sid=2000 <br />

We Are Legendary - Retroactive!<br />
We are making a exception for this guild achievement. Any legendary items you have already earned will count. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560536194/question-on-we-are-legenday/))<br />
<br />
New content for the next Beta Patch<br />
We do not plan to patch today, though we plan to have a great deal of new content in the upcoming patch. You'll get access to new zones and dungeons, and potentially an increase in level cap to 85. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560839916/goblins-patch-today/))<br />

Feral Q&amp;A<br />
Can you make savage roar undispellable? <br />
This is something we're discussing, but haven't made a decision yet. <br />
<br />
Will Shred ever have no positional? : \ <br />
We like Shred and Backstab with positional requirements. We haven't changed our stance on this. If you find Shred too difficult to use in PvE, then Mangle. If you're not happy in PvE with the damage you can do while Mangling, and can't manage to stay in a position where you can Shred, then I hate to say it but this probably isn't the spec for you. In PvP we think it's more of an issue, but we've also buffed Mangle to where you can do credible damage with it. <br />
<br />
Will dash be given the same treatment as sprint? (lower CD lower dura) <br />
We think Dash is fine. <br />
<br />
Is the new version of innervate intended to be worth less to specs with small mana pools like Feral? <br />
Yes, exactly. In Cataclysm, healer mana matters a great deal. In that environment, having some dps who can prop up healer mana so well is quite overpowered. It's okay to have utility in providing the healers extra mana, but it can't get out of control. Balance and Resto druids will have bigger Innervates, but then they are also balanced around needing to use those on themselves most of the time. <br />
<br />
Can you change the new version of survival instincts to have less of an effect but a shorter CD?, 60% is great, but at a 5 min cd, id rather have 40% on a 3 minute cd or something to that effect ya know? <br />
This is the kind of thing we're still messing with. There are situations where the short cooldown weaker version is more useful and others where it isn't. <br />
<br />
Is Bear form damage going to be a little bit higher then it currently is for Cata? can pulverize and mangle at least hit harder then maul? its kinda lame that our talented abilities hit much weaker then maul in bear atm :( <br />
I wouldn't worry too much about numbers yet. We haven't made much of an effort to adjust them and won't until we're happy with the basic mechanics. <br />
<br />
What is the purpose of thorns? you've been consolidating weird buffs so, i figure this is on the list of weird buffs with no real purpose<br />
We think it has more of a purpose with more damage packed into a smaller window than weak damage available 100% of the time. In the latter case you'd never think twice about attacking someone with Thorns because it's never not there. It also asks a little more of the druid to use Thorns at the right time rather than just whenever the buff drops off. Thorns isn't a raid buff on the scale of something like Fortitude or Bloodlust so we see no reason to consolidate it. <br />
<br />

Crusader Strike<br />
I see this comment a lot, but I don't understand it. Can you explain to me why a 4.4 Crusader Strike is not strictly better than a 4.5 Crusader Strike? That might be the case if your rotation was so jam packed that you can't fit in another Crusader Strike until its cooldown drops by an entire 1.5 global cooldown, but we've gone on record saying that the rotation won't work that way. Hitting Crusader Strike even a fraction of a second sooner means a Templar's Verdict comes that sooner, letting you start the rotation again. That's a dps increase.<br />
<br />
Haste is valuable above and beyond the Sanctity of Battle talent of course. Swinging more often is a dps increase alone, and can also lead to more frequent Art of War procs or Seal ticks.<br />
<br />
Templar's Verdict at less than 3 stacks will almost never make sense unless you're in a situation where perhaps someone is running away (and for whatever reason you can't stun them etc.) so you might as well hit them now.

Lightwell Feedback Needed<br />
While any kind of feedback is helpful to a degree, we are much more interested in the feedback of players who have tried Lightwell in the most recent beta builds than those who just never cared for the talent. We are actively making changes to the spell to see how it plays, so it's important for us to know if the changes are noticeable and fun without that feedback getting buried under the cruft of bad reputation that Lightwell has built up over time. If it's still not cutting it, we're prepared to try something different, but we need a chance to see if that is in fact the case.

Yeah, I could see people selling themselves to guilds so they can get the legendaries. But At least guild's that have already put in the hard work aren't getting punished now.<br />

But a heroic only encounter? Sounds interesting, I like it.<br />
<br />
Edit: Ha, I just realised that Halion, Valiona and Theralion all have 'liona' or 'lion' at the end of their name. Maybe that's the Twilight dragon theme? Like for the red dragonflight it's 'strasza' or 'strasz'? And for blue it's 'gosa' or 'gos'?</div></div><hr />

<br />
for pve if an added threat multiplier is added , then its going to be very useful in the `oh shit` over aggro situation - salv on the overaggro person and thorns on the tank to help balance threat again<br />
<br />
for pvp , i can see a glyph for using it when stunned - would make you think twice about attacking a moonkin who suddenly goes to armour cap when stun locked and adds thorns which are reflecting 1200 or more damage (and thats right now with T10 - not @85 with much better gear) - a rogue would literally shred themselves first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But a heroic only encounter? Sounds interesting, I like it.<br />
<br />
Edit: Ha, I just realised that Halion, Valiona and Theralion all have 'liona' or 'lion' at the end of their name. Maybe that's the Twilight dragon theme? Like for the red dragonflight it's 'strasza' or 'strasz'? And for blue it's 'gosa' or 'gos'?<br />
<br />
Why do they need unique models? Random minor dragons don't need unique models each</div></div><hr />

You can just make the spell different...<br />
Ffor example you can simply make it a source that ppl get healed from when its down. aoe healing.lets say lightwell heals 10 raid members or party for an amount of heal for 6 seconds or less or more and has a cd of 2 mins ....<br />
so that way you dont care for ppl clicking it.<br />
If the raid is on low hp the lightwell will work like tranquility of the druid.</div></div><hr />

nowdays you can see keyboard turning ratardins/deathknights from rubbish guilds with welfare shadowmournes... also they are way too common items to be any kind of legendaries imo.<br />
<br />
Rose-tinted glasses much? MC wasn't exactly a hard instance back then; some of us remember 25 players being pretty much carried by the 15 that knew what they were doing. The bosses really weren't hard by today's standards - no enrage timers, few abilities which could 1-shot people(before Vael at least), and with a raid of 40 people, you could afford numerous deaths and still manage a kill. It was always possible for scrub guilds to get them.<br />
<br />
The big difference? Back then, raids took 40 people. Now it's 25. This means there's more loot per player, it's easier to organize, and there's more raids per server per week. Legendaries haven't really become any easier to get; it's just that there are more raids that are going for them now.</div></div><hr />

About the Legendary achievement: Good cause then they won't make people go back to farm everything. Would just be annoying for those who already are the owner of legendary items.

<br />
Well she is alive, it's just that in Outland she used a generic dragon model so you couldn't see the scars afflicted upon her by Deathwing attempting to mate with her and being defeated by Korialstrasz.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not sure, but I believe BC takes place before she created the first Twilight Dragons, one of whom, Dargonax, destabilized during a fight with various dragons and lore heroes and burned away, taking Sinestra with him.<br />
<br />
Whether she survived or died but was resurrected is up to speculation.</div></div><hr />

I've been expecting them to remove lightwell for years lol! As i'm sure many others have. It's never been a useful talent and never will be now that we have prayer of mending and circle of healing. The only fix is to make it into a kind of HoT counterpart to the warlock's healthstone (call it a &quot;healthshard&quot; or something?), and remove the break on damage entirely. Then maybe it'll be useful, rather than be the most useless talent in the game. But I doubt they'll do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People expect (read: hope) for tiny little differences in the models here and there to make the final result different from every other dragon they've ever seen. Not staggering changes but differences on the level of Onyxia and Nefarian would be enough for most. With Valoria and Theralon all they did was take Halion's model (which was unique) then add a bit more blue in for Theralon and leave it as-is for Valoria.<br />
<br />
Personally I would like to see a lot more minor differences but I dread to think how much more hard drive space the game would take up if this were the case.<br />

<br />
Prett disapointed so far, I expected more ways to fail the rotation. Let's face it, either make possible that more abilities come off cooldown at the same time, or simply use my example of Templar Verdict, so that ppl are provided with more ways to fail the rotation.</div></div><hr />
