Mike Morhaime Interviews <br />
Mike Morhaime, co-founder and former President of Blizzard Entertainment, recently attended GameLab in Barcelona to accept an award. During interviews with VG247, he was asked about his non-compete contract (https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/26/blizzard-co-founder-mike-morhaime-no-longer-non-compete-coming-back-games/) and about why Heroes of the Storm failed (https://www.vg247.com/2019/06/26/heroes-storm-failed-probably-late-mike-morhaime/).<br />
<br />
<br />
His non-compete ended in April, and he is free to pursue whatever he wants. <br />
He is currently in the brainstorming phase, and doesn't have anything concrete to share yet.<br />
Some of his ideas are games, some of them are not. <br />
He thinks the Heroes of the Storm team made a great game, but it was a little too late. <br />
One of his biggest regrets was not pursuing Dota early enough. <br />
There were more people playing Dota than Warcraft 3.<br />
Blizzard had their hands' full supporting World of Warcraft.<br />
If he could go back in time he would have had a team start doing something with Dota before the launch of Starcraft 2.</div></div><hr />

Nah people still had some grip on reality in Warcraft 3, it was just a good game. Now the factions are basically treated like fantasy Republicans and Democrats and everyone's a partisan.</div></div><hr />

Well, only a few missions involved teaming up with other races. So we didn't have much to dislike anyway. And I think finales are ok to have team-ups. I'm worried about WarCraft 4 though. I was fine with Orcs and Trolls hanging out together and Human and Dwarves/Gnomes. But I think the game would be ruined if they did Alliance/Horde. Undead and Night Elf are too unique to have their culture/design eroded by Modern WoW-like shit.</div></div><hr />

With sub numbers dropping and the game getting older I think splitting the playerbase makes less and less sense and perhaps Blizzard sees it the same way. Letting the factions play together just doubled everyones playerpool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You would expect it right? dividing the world works great at 12 million subs, not so much at a tenth of that. Trouble is everytime a game like Rift did it it was seen as an even worse case of &quot;THATS IT GAMES DEAD&quot; than server merges.<br />
<br />
If anything i could imagine warmode becomes the faction focus and when not in warmode players are nuetral to do it without doing it like how CRZ totally isn't covering up how many ghost town servers there.</div></div><hr />

Not taking up DotA was probably the biggest mistake of Blizzard in hindsight.<br />

<br />
Ya. I've always felt half of their problems were from the simple fact that the game blew up so fast, they weren't prepared to deal with it, and they scrambled a long time trying. WoW sucked all the oxygen out of the room - great for their profits, but they weren't prepared.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's right in line with the story direction and there is nothing crazy happening that would not be expected. And of course it's not going to win an award, but you probably are not very grounded in reality if you are expecting the storyline from a video game to be revolutionizing writing standards.</div></div><hr />

That's what will always happen when you have a two faction split like this. The story can't evolve because you always have to somehow support both sides and neither can ever actually progress or win.</div></div><hr />

Because the writers, apparently, have not yet realized they are writing for a MMORPG instead of a single player RPG with multiple plot branches and endings like, for example, DragonAge. I bet some of them believe they are working for Bethesda.</div></div><hr />

I did quit playing. Not because of the storyline or anything against BfA, I just wanted time to do other things without constantly feeling like I was missing out. <br />
That said, I still enjoy watching lore and storyline cinematics, but BfA was supposed to be about Horde vs Alliance, the getting back to roots of the Warcraft universe. At this point, Blizzard keeps stating we aren’t getting Garrosh 2.0 while delivering just that so far. Instead of getting back to Alliance vs Horde and the destruction of villages, towns, cities like should happen and that we started with, we’re now getting Horde leadership teaming up with Alliance leadership to take down a common threat. It’s been done multiple times.</div></div><hr />

This will never happen purely because this would mean the writers would have to make the Alliance look bad in some way. Only the Horde can be the evil people in Warcraft, remember?</div></div><hr />

Well in MoP we took down the tyrannical leader, aka Garrosh. It's already 10000000% confirmed Sylvanas will not be dealt with in BFA, the main boss is N'zoth. She will be dethroned yes, but it's not the same ending as MoP. So yeah, you're wrong, it's not MoP 2.0, the expansion was actually good.<br />

Not stating anything about the garbage level storytelling of the whole BfA lore fiasco. Just that specific fact. Baine is NOT what is bad in this story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Garrosh was already a nutjob at that point, he had butchered the crew of an Alliance ship on the way back from Northrend just after a truce was declared to get his rocks off.<br />
<br />
Cairne could tell Garrosh was a nutter and it was Thrall's fault for putting him in the position that he would have to invoke Mak'gora.<br />

So she'll be the second to last boss. Then she'll get away, and then be solo'd in a leveling quest for the next expansion like Garrosh.</div></div><hr />

Blizz once again choosing the worst story telling possible aimed at the lowest common denominator of wow player base. <br />
<br />
It’s worse than an 80s Saturday morning cartoon at this point. <br />
<br />
What about us horde who back sylvanas and loathe thrall and his band of traitors? I don’t want to betray my warchief again. I backed garrosh and I back sylvanas</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is stupid to bring the void god as major lore enemie (they are behind every single issue we have deal over the years), and still be divide by factions.<br />
For a story point of view they will unite the faction to deal with the major treath that will be the old god/void gods.<br />
<br />
Blizz is trying to do the same SWTOR did when they lunch the Eternal throne Expansion, where the factions disolve to deal with the comflict, but only last for that arc of the story. (pvp will never end, u can still engane on combat, but you will be able to interact to the other faction in some ways, no economie, but you could make parties and quest together)<br />
<br />
I think is a nice idea what blizzard is planing, realistic the story of WoW have been us dealing with major cosmic bad guys, and have 2 faction havent been paing off. So to save the planet and move foward been divide make 0 sense.</div></div><hr />

LOL u have 0 clue about the story if you think everyone on classic hate each other, outside human vs orc normal comflic, comming out from Warcraft 3 that it. Most of the comflic that happen on classic is evryone vs a 3 faction or a big bad dude.</div></div><hr />

You realize Thrall is the actual Warchief in Classic, right? The guy you're hating for looking for compromise with the Alliance is the actual guy in charge, doing exactly the same thing. Lore-wise, there is essentially no meaningful AvH conflict in Classic. There's, like, some Nelfs complaining about Horde encroaching in Ashenvale and a short Admiral Proudmoore questline that takes place in Durotar, I think, and that's basically it. The plot of Vanilla WoW, if there even is such a thing, is basically &quot;black dragons be evil&quot; and &quot;something something Old Gods&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully loyalists will get some kind of unique content this time around. Even if it’s just a short scenario to butcher Thunder Bluff until we’re overwhelmed and knocked out or something of the like.<br />
<br />
&quot;Horde isn't how I like it, so it isn't Horde&quot;<br />
<br />
Horde and Alliance are extremely distinct, regardless of whether they are honorable or genocidal maniacs.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, though, Horde will still get to be the generic, bland 'bad guys' you want them to be. They always end up that way. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
