Hyjal/BT Jewelcrafting patterns<br />
I don't think the designs are available from any NPC on PTRs yet, but the items are definitely in game and we should probably see them very soon. Basically, all the patterns rewarded through Scale of Sands reputation or dropping from BT/Hyjal bosses will be available from the Shattered Sun Offensive.<br />

Lord Ahune loot table<br />
Lord Ahune (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/lordahune2.jpg) is a new Headless-horseman-like boss, you will be able to fight him during the Midsummer Festival (June 21 - July 5) and after a small fight he might reward you with a few epics. That's a daily quest and you'll be able to summon him once a day.<br />
<br />
Phase 1 - The boss spawns two types of adds and you can't really damage him, just take care of the adds and after a minute, Ahune will go into phase 2.<br />
Phase 2 - Ahune submerges (ragnaros-style) and its Frozen Core will spawn, that's when you attack him ! After some time Ahune will emerge and you'll have to fight adds for one more minute, etc ...<br />

Scaling issues<br />
All creaturing scaling is broken in the current build. We decided to push it anyway since it was mostly cosmetic. There might be some issues with hit-boxes and animations but we wanted testing over the weekend with updated data and rather than wait three days, we pushed it with the bug live. Hey, it's the PTR =P<br />
<br />
For a good laugh, summon your &quot;Peanut&quot; or &quot;Egbert&quot; pet if you have one =P<br />

<br />
<br />
well no because remember that mages frostbolt only hits for around 1500 with full pvp gear and crits for around 2200 against players that have high resilence.. so you take into account 2.5 second cast - 20% haste not casting speed plus low crit chance when frost spec without having a pet out for shater combos so ,its just average .<br />
<br />
this will only be an upgrade against hunters thats it. A frost mages pet freeze has a long cooldown and if you turn on icyveins and try and do a frost nova shater combo you already wasted to much time of those little 20 seconds. Most rouges already have shadowstep so casting on them will still not be posible and icyveins is best used to try and finish off a target in wich most cases the pet is either dead or its freeze is down.. <br />
<br />
Good teams kill the mages pet right when its casted so its important to use freeze either to cc or try and get the target low asap b4 pet is killed. Therefore thats the reason why theres not to many high skilled mages because it takes skill to play unlike warlocks or hunters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree, but even frost mages are pretty pitiful at the higher level arena's. All classes can two shot their pet, and they can only achieve true dps on frozen targets which is just one disspell away from impossible. They really need to just go through and lower the dmg of all mage/destro lock abilities, and make their spells have faster cast times. Lets say 1.5 being the max. 2.5 second casts are an eternity against any arena team that is any good at all. The reason hunters are so much better is because of instant abilities and better range. Its very hard to prevent them from executing atleast some of their dps, where as a frost mage has zero push back protection on their frost bolts meaning they can only do real dmg if no one is attacking them. This obviously is never the case since they are usually the primary target.</div></div><hr />

Life Tap was gone from my action bars, looked in my spellbook to find 1 rank with the following description: &quot;Converts 26% of maximum health into 26% of maximum mana.&quot;<br />

Edit2: Some more info on Life Tap, currently it seems to be returning a percentage of your current amount of mana, instead of maximum amount. I can't determine what percentage but it's not 26% and this functionality is definately not intended.</div></div><hr />

All classes can two shot their pet, and they can only achieve true dps on frozen targets which is just one disspell away from impossible. They really need to just go through and lower the dmg of all mage/destro lock abilities, and make their spells have faster cast times. Lets say 1.5 being the max. 2.5 second casts are an eternity against any arena team that is any good at all. The reason hunters are so much better is because of instant abilities and better range. Its very hard to prevent them from executing atleast some of their dps, where as a frost mage has zero push back protection on their frost bolts meaning they can only do real dmg if no one is attacking them. This obviously is never the case since they are usually the primary target.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is true, but I have never seen frost mages as pure damage dealers. The best Mages i've seen are more about controllings things and helping reduce damage done on the team instead of standing in the background spamming Frostbolt.<br />
<br />
A lot of Mages damage comes from Ice lance and frostbite procs, or am I wrong on that?</div></div><hr />

Those two changes would help.<br />

Just on its own, the immunity during IV is interesting for raiding, if you can time it when you need the pushback but probably not enough.</div></div><hr />

On the papper the aim of the mage in a raid is to be the best distance damage dealeur and the master of aoe, isn't it?<br />
<br />
I'm very pessimistic about this démo up, why should we take more than 1 mage (for the fire vulerability debuff) in a raid? Replacing thme by destru démo is by far a best solution in almost any case (more hit points, more one target dps, more multitarget dps, more pack aoe dps, more mana regeneration, more debuff for the raid, healstones, soulstone, better stats on the set gear cause of the load of spirit on mage sets.....)<br />

A priest is NOT a healer which relies on spell crits. Paladin healers rely on crits, priests don't. All we really need on gear is +healing, +mana regen, +haste, and some sta &amp; int. We don't need +spell hit, or +spell crit.<br />

I couldn't care less if my heals actually crit. They should get rid of the spellcrit and put some more haste, stats or mana-regen on the bracers instead. Also... I'd like to see a better socketbonus dann 2 spelldmg *cough cough*<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you have large amounts of healing and spell haste already spell crit is actually a relatively efficient stat to get for priests. For instance flash heal with 2k healing is an average of 2050 healing (untalented, pre-crit). That means 1% spell crit adds about 20.5 healing on average or is equivalent to having +47 healing at that level. Greater heal is 4304 healing (untalented, pre-crit) at 2k healing so 1% crit adds 43 healing on average or is equivalent to having +50 healing at that point. <br />
<br />
It isn't a primary healing stat for priests certainly but once you have lots of +heal already (which you should in T6 gear) small amounts of spell crit give a decent boost to your healing. Basically, it isn't the end of the world and the amounts of +heal it equates to makes it an ok stat to put on the gear.</div></div><hr />

on ptr life tap takes 15% health and returns 15% mana instead of 26% (untalented). If its a bug or a tooltip error remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />

On life server (unbuffed) with improve life tap :<br />
In PvE stuff i loose 16.5% life and gain 23.5% mana<br />
In PvP stuff i loose 11.3% life and gain 20.6% mana<br />
<br />
First point with this modification : You will be oblige to get some intellect and stop stacking stamina if you want more regen<br />
Second point : This modification reduce drasticaly the regen efficience of the warlock in PvP format (because you have more life)<br />
<br />
Its not a big deal, but i m steal asking one question :<br />
All the rank of the spell merge to 1 or there is still some lower lvl one ?<br />
Because loosing the lvl 1 life tap to use when you are focus in PvP is much more of a problem.</div></div><hr />

Hi, Shaman here. I'd like to disagree with you. Shamanistic Rage is a 41 point talent for enhancement and as it currently is even a hunter just pew pewing arcane shot randomly can erase a deep talent for us. I think the change is moot anyways, even with it we die but it takes a few more seconds. Any class that lets a melee shaman get into range (or isn't stunlocked) fails the game terribly as everyone knows we can be kited 100-0 with ease and that isn't changing.</div></div><hr />

This is pretty much mostly true (Enhancement Shaman here). And if the change to Shamanistic Rage is to be considered excessive, than skills in a similar vein should, too. I'm looking at The Beast Within. It's undispellable and affects two targets. No, Shamanistic rage being immune to dispel won't create an imbalance because we're still completely weak against snare when it's up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything is about pvp atm, the tekkenplayers stole the game over the last year. A little content added to PvE will not change the fact that everything concerning classes and items seems to be dependant of Arena. God I hate that bloody word, biggest mistake ever made, Arena. Teenage Tekkenwankers, play consolegames instead damnit!!!<br />
<br />
Blizz are trying to keep everyone happy by adding a little PvE content now, but you have to be more than just blind not to see that the PvP people are the ones Blizzars is aiming to please. The reason is pretty easy to figure out too. These people do not require content made for them all the time and there's plenty of money in going E-sports aswell. Computergames is not the worst things capitalism has on it's conscience though :)</div></div><hr />
