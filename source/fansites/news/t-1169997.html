Different Rules for Spells in PvP and PvE<br />
Is there a reason damage spells can't effect players differently?<br />
We do this already. Look at abilities such as Colossus Smash and even the concept of PvP CC durations, which has been in the game for a long time. <br />
<br />
It's not our option of first resort because it's not intuitive for players and it means anytime we want to make balance adjustments, we must change two sets of numbers. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/231112-why-are-we-not-balanced-this-way/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6201231500?page=2#22))<br />
<br />
Content Difficulty and Consumption Speed<br />
That way, maybe some of the prestige of killing bosses pre-nerf, or on lower levels of nerf stay.<br />
Other than world firsts, was there ever any prestige to killing a boss? (outside the guild itself achieving that kill)<br />
<br />
Heck, even people following the race don't care who killed a boss 2nd in the world, much less 20th...<br />
<br />
No, but they care on their own servers, even if they don't raid themselves. It's a bit like Britain's surprise medal in the gymnastics yesterday; I don't like gymnastics so don't care about that at all. However, if one of those gymnasts lived on my street, I would be interested.<br />
Sure, realm firsts might also have some prestige on the realm level, you're absolutely right. But as before, other than that... (and perhaps the first faction kill on the realm, as well).<br />
<br />
Sounds like you are admitting that realm communities have been killed. By LFD and LFR.<br />
You're reading too much into that post.<br />
<br />
Actually, challenge dungeons will help bring back that realm community feeling that might be missing for some of you, as groups for those dungeons have to be manually formed.<br />
<br />
This comment alone, shows that you have no idea what is going on on realms regarding raiding.<br />
You didn't understand my post at all. I said it very clear, outside the guild itself (which is what you mention in your post), not many players really care about who killed a boss other than world first and perhaps their realm first.<br />
<br />
Any reason as to why we're not seeing a developer respond in this thread to some of the proposals made to revive aspects that should already be there.., but aren't due to some clear direct &quot;features&quot;, one would think they could squeeze in a few minutes considering they have all the time in the world to reply on us forums?<br />
These forums are for you, the players, to interact between you and discuss almost anything you want. And we're taking care of noting the feedback we can find, as in this thread, and sending it to them (which we're doing not just with this thread, also others).<br />
<br />
It is abundantly clear to even the slowest of individuals that you have absolutely no clue as to what drives players Draztal which is quite astounding after 185 pages, and even more clear that you only serve a purpose of ridiculing what people here say.<br />
I understand it, I honestly do. I'm a raider myself and I share some of those desires you have expressed here. But there must be a reason for it that can be based on something else than &quot;taking something away from others&quot; or &quot;prestige&quot;, etc. And there've been individuals here that have spoken clearly about those reasons, and we've noted them and we've sent feedback to the devs with the most common points here. <br />
<br />
The response quoted and the fact that you claim challenge dungeons will bring some realm community back is testament to incompetence at the highest level for reasons already highlighted many times over the past 100 pages, but I'll happily point one out for you. If challenge modes aren't completed to a gold medal standard by a sufficient amount of characters we will see &quot;balancing&quot; (normal people would call it nerfs) so that you can ride the high horse claiming success just as is the case with lfr / lfd.<br />
You're making assumptions, and judging my posts based on those assumptions. You're also forgetting that on challenge dungeons you're actually competing against the clock, and you'll be able to prove that you've been faster than everyone else. <br />
<br />
I also feel my comment was ignored. Just as the people above me stated, i dont see any facts you base your comment on regarding almost no one caring beyond world firsts, apart from a very broad and ( in my opinion ) unjustified generalization.<br />
Well, in that case, I guess it won't take you long to show me a forum post cheering someone for the world 36th kill of Heroic Hagara, right?<br />
<br />
I think it's actually you that does not understand how much people care about those. The more I read your posts the more I think you absolutely have no clue.<br />
Ah, but that's the thing. And that's why I'm still posting on this thread. I understand why people care so much about those. But I can't find an objective reason to back it up (I'm speaking about arguments like only a minority should see the content, etc, not the whole thread). Some concerns did have objective reasonings to back them up, and that was great. Some others can only really relate to nostalgia (wanting TBC back without mentioning the downsides it had) or wishing to retain exclusivity/prestige in a way that is demeaning to others.<br />
<br />
Are you kidding me? When i tried to give an idea, i was ignored. By Draztal too, he said world firsts matter only. That was the reply to my idea of a design change. Now, thats how much they care, in my experience.<br />
I can't comment on your ideas. But I've certainly haven't said that world firsts are the only thing that matter. What I've said is that for the community at large, it's usually just that what's mentioned. And you can check that by yourself visiting the most popular fansites out there. You won't see them mention that X guild has been 10th in the world killing a boss.<br />
<br />
Both of them care immensely about what position they are inside their faction, realm and world.<br />
Read my post again, that's not what I meant (and I even specified it on that post). Of course your guild cares about its position. People outside your guild, though, probably don't (unless they're looking for a guild to apply to) unless you're world first/realm first/country first/etc. Hopefully now what I was trying to get through makes sense? It's not about how your guildmates feel about your position.<br />
<br />
The fact that people mention TBC has little to do with nostalgia, it has to do with the idea that there was a lot more content available back then. TBC had a certain policy when it came to progression and that policy was changed in WotLK.<br />
A policy that had side effects that have been discussed in this thread at length. Those are the downsides that noone has really mentioned during this discussion.<br />
<br />
There should always be ongoing competition in WoW, and something for people to aim towards, as soon as there isn't there won't be any drive to improve yourself as a player.<br />
You tell us that we can't speak for an entire population, alright, but then don't doing it yourself telling us what we do and don't care about.<br />
If you look at popular community tools such as wowprogress, there're always new kills being made every day, so to me that looks as ongoing competition. <br />
<br />
Not gonna quote the rest of your post, but it's a spot on explanation of how gamers think and act. We are competitive by nature and we do care of our own performances, even if its no 134 in the world.<br />
Of course, but not everyone is interested in the raid race and just want to experience the encounters at the pace they can.<br />
<br />
I get what you mean, but people do care if they pass another guild that was faster than them on the last tier. So your point is not entirely true. If you pass another guild they do care that someone else did that, if it makes them fall behind in the race of killing bosses first in their realm. It does work the other way around aswell, when we manage to kill something people rush fast to see if others managed to do that on the same night.<br />
I agree with this. My post was talking about the prestige perspective specifically, which is a different one than this. Of course, if your guild advances over another in the realm rank, you'll cheer about it, and the other guild most likely will try to advance as quickly as possible to retake that position. <br />
<br />
You're not serious about being in a raiding guild yourself are you?<br />
I am, as I said, I've been raiding since 2005, still do, and have no intention of stopping in Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
Do you honestly believe those sites would have such high hit numbers when people really don't care as much as you suggest? The numbers prove you wrong. Last tier though, even wowprogress was more for &quot;who got it fastest&quot; (on our realm) then who is furthest, which is directly reflecting on the main concern, too little content for the expected amount of time and the dilution of raiding as a whole.<br />
Of course they care about their own progress and how they compare against them. But once you leave that specific case, people in your realm that is raiding at a different pace most likely don't really care about what your guild is doing (and care about theirs, obviously) and care about what's happening to the guilds around their same place.<br />
<br />
I'm quite frankly stunned at how it seems to be acceptable to demand nerfs and easier, simplified gameplay, but asking for a challenge is tantamount to sacrilege.<br />
Asking for a challenge is right, and the answer is that you have that challenge there. You can turn the debuff off at any time and face those bosses without the Power of the Aspects. But that's an answer some of you don't like. And while it's fine that you don't like the answer, it's not right to say that there's no way to have content that you feel is challenging for you today.<br />
<br />
Okay. Nobody cares what guild killed Heroic Ragnaros heroic 4th, but they will care about AoE fest speed runs? What is the point of Blizzard adding Challenge mode dungeons when competition does not matter?<br />
You're mixing competition with prestige... (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/228883-we-consume-content-too-fast/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4879017939?page=187#3740))<br />
<br />
The Purpose of LFR<br />
However, LFR does make a person get sick and bored of DS extremely quickly... running it lfr and normal on multiple chars each week has removed alot of peoples passion for raiding DS<br />
If you are running LFR and normal every week on multiple chars, I don't think it should be a surprise you eventually lose the passion for raiding the place... After so much of doing the same, you'll get tired, be it LFR, HC raiding, dailies... anything, really. <br />
<br />
Yes i could skip LFR altogether, but the tier bonuses are something most players want and are needed to become competitive.<br />
You get the same tier bonuses (and higher item level) from Normal and Heroic DS.<br />
<br />
and yet, you guys have made running older tiers obsolete, with forcing (by gear i mean) to chain run the latests tier raid.. feels kind of silly, yes?<br />
You can run older tiers whenever you want. Not just for experiencing the content these days, also for the gear for transmogrification (if you like a particular tier set that you're missing), achievements and so on.<br />
<br />
Any game that cannot pose even a slight challenge before completion is pretty messed up development wise.<br />
And even with the 30% debuff on DS, the game poses a challenge (perhaps not to you, but certainly to others). <br />
<br />
appease people who think that paying for a game entitles you to see all the content<br />
And why are they wrong on that thought? On which basis should someone think that he can not see the content even if he's willing to pay the subscription for it?<br />
<br />
Why not just mail everyone the BiS items and rarest mounts?<br />
Is that what the players are demanding? I'm yet to see someone ask for that (that is not trolling, either). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/230999-what-purpose-does-lfr-have/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5035904684?page=10#183))<br />

PW: Solace change?<br />
We think it is possible to balance active vs passive regen. The key is in how healers use mana. Nobody needs infinite regen. You just need enough to heal a fight. If you consider a fight where you never have to heal, then Solace will crush any other mana return because you have so many free GCDs in which to spam it. However, you also don't need that mana for healing in the contrived fight with no healing. As fight intensity increases, the need for mana increases BUT the time available for Solace decreases. Solace will work best on fights where there is very intensive healing followed by quiet periods in which you can nuke. But depending on the timing, Mindbender might work for those fights just as well. <br />
<br />
We don't like Solace with a cooldown because then you feel like you must use it on cooldown. With no cooldown, then is there is a continuum between fights where you have free time but need mana and fights where every cast time must be spent on a heal. The choice becomes the priest's. <br />
<br />
I'm still seeing a lot of &quot;I need to spam Solace so make it more spamable&quot; responses. You're not going to convince us with that argument. Let us know in what specific situations you are struggling with mana and what types of spells you are trying to cast. That is the actual issue in our minds. <br />
<br />
I am also still seeing a lot of &quot;we have provided you with the evidence.&quot; I wouldn't be asking if you had. There are maybe 3 links to parses and a couple more with any kinds of numbers at all. If you feel it is that easy to make your case, then make it.<br />
<br />
As an aside, the only thing we didn't like about Telluric Currents as active mana generation was that it scaled too well with gear (in 4.3) and would have been a mandaory glyph (in 5.0).<br />
<br />
It's a very common thing that when people feel they aren't being listened to they complain louder and more frequently.<br />
I have been in this business for 15 years, so I can say with certainty that that strategy does not work. You run the risk of your entire point being dismissed if you come across as too uninformed to make an argument with some substance to back up the sweeping claims. If you are trying to convince anyone in a situation where you can't just order them to do something, whether that person is a boss, teacher, co-worker or government official, you'll do better with logic and reason than insults and hyperbole. <br />
<br />
We appreciate the passion -- just channel it into something productive. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/230903-can-you-please-explain-the-pw-solace-change/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6201271578?page=10#189))<br />

Judgement is once again a melee attack that has a 30-yard range. (Yes, re-read that to make sure you didn’t misread it...)<br />
<br />
Edit: Judgement is also spelled Judgment now. The developers are playing nasty tricks on me to make sure I'm awake.<br />
<br />
It's a PvP nerf. Now it'll trigger Frost Armor and Nature's Grasp again.<br />
Correct. This is the primary purpose of the change.<br />

As a result of the change to Malefic Grasp's mechanics, Agony now takes twice as long to ramp up, since the ticks are no longer faster under MG's channel. Is this additional nerf intended?<br />
No, this should be fixed in the next build. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/227466-beta-class-balance-analysis/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5889309137?page=163#3248))<br />

Starting in November, SWTOR will have a limited free to play mode. During the EA earnings call today, we were reminded that the game needs 500,000 subscribers to break even. Subscription numbers have declined below one million now, making a free to play option a good way to allow players turned off by the subscription fee to continue playing. The game's price will be reduced to $15 and it will still come with one free month of gametime, allowing anyone who purchases the game to experience the full version before deciding which level of play they would like. You can find more information in the Free-To-Play FAQ (http://www.swtor.com/support/helpcenter/6449).<br />
<br />
The free version of the game allows players to experience all of the class stories through level 50, but free players will have no access to Operations. Free players are also limited in the number of character customizations they can access, as well as the number of Warzones, Flashpoints, Space Missions, and auctions that can be posted. You can see a quick rundown of the limitations in this chart (http://www.swtor.com/free/features).<br />
<br />
Players who continue to pay will also gain Cartel Coins, a new currency that will allow purchase of character customization, faster leveling, and other conveniences. Some restrictions can also be &quot;unlocked&quot; with Cartel Coins. Current players will get a number of bonus coins and Fan's Choice item for being active before July 31, 2012. Players who want more Cartel Coins will be able to purchase them from the SWTOR website in the future.<br />

<br />
Starting this fall, there will be two different ways to play Star Wars: The Old Republic:<br />
<br />
Subscription — A service designed for players who want unrestricted access to all the game features via ongoing subscription or by redeeming a Game Time Card. In addition to gaining access to all game content as our current subscribers do now, subscribers will receive ongoing monthly grants of Cartel Coins, the new virtual currency that will be introduced later this fall. Cartel Coins can be used to purchase valuable in-game items including customizable gear and convenience features that will enhance the game play experience.<br />
<br />
Free-To-Play — The first 50 levels will be Free-to-Play, with restrictions on access to new content and advanced player features. Some restrictions can be &quot;unlocked&quot; with Cartel Coins.<br />
<br />
As the first step towards adding the new Free-to-Play option this fall, Star Wars: The Old Republic will go on sale in August for $14.99 USD, including one-month of free subscription.<br />
<br />
Current and former players will also find additional benefits as part of this program. BioWare will be increasing the frequency of game content updates, with the first of many new releases coming in August. In addition, current subscribers will receive Cartel Coin grants and qualify for access to special in-game items. Even former players who re-activate now will qualify for special benefits. To learn more about these rewards, please visit www.StarWarstheOldRepublic.com/FREE.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but we are talking about BEAware here. The effort put in players expectations was probably way greater than the effort of Developers.<br />
<br />
Bioware's history is long gone, and stuff like Baldur's Gate 2, Mass Effect 1, Dragon Age: Origins, Jade Empire, and specially HK's KOTOR are there, in the past.<br />
<br />
They have a line of newly produced manure, as DA2, ME3, and KOTOR2. They only worry on adapting the game to the gouging tactics of John Riccitiello, making no effort outside that.<br />
<br />
The result is games that not only have no appeal to the player, but anger them by clearly trying to strip the customers from all their money offering nothing in return.<br />
<br />
And repeating this stupid tactic is what's ruining Diablo3, BTW. Come on, increasing repair bills and removing gold from vases and chests, so people are FORCED to buy gold from the RMAH, giving Blizz their 15%? Easier to leave such game, than to spend money on botter's gold.</div></div><hr />

Also I quit SWtoR months and months ago. Its horrible though, I thought it was a great game and I loved the storyline etc, but for some reason it couldn't hold my attention. It played like a single player and not like a MMO. I almost feel like it was released into the wrong genre - it would have been a very successful RPG, especially with online group play incorporated into it.</div></div><hr />

Personally I think he is losing the argument, players seem to be catching him out.<br />
<br />
Also I hate the 'snowflake' argument. It seems to be a war against people actually being good at the game and wanting to be better then the norm. Shock horror? Every good game I have ever played has had challenges - and ones where you complete it in a day have been utterly forgettable. I think deep down Blizzard knows this, otherwise they would remove normal and heroic mode and leave us with simply LFR.<br />
<br />
Plus everyone is hypocrites on this subject. They will use the snowflake argument about challenging content and people wanting to be 'special', and then proceed to post in the 300+ page thread about transmogrification after spending hours putting together a unique and good looking armour set. The Orwellian 'doublethink' here is astounding, but its rarely worth highlighting.</div></div><hr />

Anyone can run an old instance or raid to get a transmog piece. How many people were able to experience the Sapph reanimate sequence in vanilla?<br />

Although Bioware is the main factor to blame. They haven't being themselves for a while and look strangely proud of sucking. I believe they have a HUGE friend list with dozens of IGN employees, that keep kissing Bioware's asses telling how awesome they are, because the amount of money that come from EA into their site.<br />
<br />
But yes, from now on the amount of time invested into WoW should be taken into account. Probably a way to attract people would be legacy boost.<br />
<br />
The same way sites like Ten Ton Hammer verify ownership, by choosing pieces of the gear to be changed could be used for other MMOs that is return would give boosts to the characters in their own games. That way players would be carrying their legacy from WoW to the new game and then would be more eager to stay.</div></div><hr />

Your comparison is bit flawed, let me fix it for you:<br />
<br />
The special snowflakes don't just want to be special, they want to make sure the challenge stays the same for everyone else coming after them. It's like people farming some really sweet transmog gear and then whining at Blizzard because suddenly people don't have to farm it, but instead can just show up to the instance portal and get all the gear from there instantly.<br />
<br />
Edit: there was about 10 mins long vid on ytube with someone explaning why it's good that there is some content not everyone can access right away (and no, heroic mode of the place I've farmed for 2 months on LFR and Normal is not content I can't access right away), or rather, that there's some unexplored content that's free for grabs if you have the balls and skill for it and it's perfectly fine if that content stays unexplored by majority or entire population for quite a while. It creates much bigger desire to play the game than the LFR-Normal-Heroic-let's nerf the **it out of the places until everyone and his mother can kill them model.<br />
What on earth is supposed to motivate me to kill exactly the same boss that suddenly has twice as much HP and is doing twice as much damage than the last time I killed it. And if I can't kill it (why would I want to do that again?), Blizzard will nerf it for me until I can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you suggesting that there's some kind of challenge in farming for transmog gear? I've never heard of anyone being impressed by the &quot;challenge&quot; of a level 85 player blitzing Kara every week for 3 months to get a piece of gear. I hope you're not just using the word &quot;challenge&quot; as a substitute for &quot;timesink&quot;.<br />
<br />
The challenge in transmog is planning your outfit to make it unique.</div></div><hr />

I don't think people want to deny anyone content. They just want a difficulty curve that goes reasonably high so as to reward people who take the time to master the game to some degree. <br />
<br />
A lot of the EU thread is centred on the nerfs to Heroic difficulty - nothing to do with LFR or Normal. <br />
<br />
However you can argue that the TBC model of progression meant people were less likely to run out of content so very quickly, but that is a different argument. A lot of people liked that model not because it is elitist, but because it was a fun and steady climb and once your guild advanced enough you could move on to the next raid and there was an amazing sense of accomplishment. It did mean people could miss the final dungeon until after the expansion, which sucked, but other areas were very good.</div></div><hr />

yes and there are those who think it is &quot;cool&quot; or acceptable to be able to rub it in other peoples faces that they are better than normal people, These are the Snowflakes. How often do you see people who are truly exceptional at the game, (I am talking people in guilds in competition for world first here) complaining about people with less skill than them being able to compete in the content due to nerfs ?<br />

I've never heard of anyone being impressed by the &quot;challenge&quot; of a level 85 player blitzing Kara every week for 3 months to get a piece of gear. I hope you're not just using the word &quot;challenge&quot; as a substitute for &quot;timesink&quot;.<br />
<br />
The challenge in transmog is planning your outfit to make it unique.<br />
<br />
Not at all. I'm suggesting that hard mode raiding takes effort and that farming for xmog gear takes effort (I hope we can agree on that). <br />
<br />
Hard mode raiders (the &quot;special snowflakes that want to make sure nobody else can be as special as they are&quot; as you put it) are unhappy when Blizzard is nerfing the content that is already available to everyone, just on different difficulty settings. I'm not hard mode raider myself - never even entered DS on heroic difficulty, but I strongly disagree with the nerfing of the content. I never really disagreed with nerfing Sunwell before WotLK though, even if it almost cost me relationship to progress hard core there.<br />
<br />
How would 'moggers like, if Blizzard suddenly dramatically decreased the effort (time in this case) required to gather an xmog set they've spent 3 months farming?<br />
That's the message I was trying to convey.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The special snowflakes don't just want to be special, they want to make sure the challenge stays the same for everyone else coming after them. It's like people farming some really sweet transmog gear and then whining at Blizzard because suddenly people don't have to farm it, but instead can just show up to the instance portal and get all the gear from there instantly.<br />
<br />
Edit: there was about 10 mins long vid on ytube with someone explaning why it's good that there is some content not everyone can access right away (and no, heroic mode of the place I've farmed for 2 months on LFR and Normal is not content I can't access right away), or rather, that there's some unexplored content that's free for grabs if you have the balls and skill for it and it's perfectly fine if that content stays unexplored by majority or entire population for quite a while. It creates much bigger desire to play the game than the LFR-Normal-Heroic-let's nerf the **it out of the places until everyone and his mother can kill them model.<br />
What on earth is supposed to motivate me to kill exactly the same boss that suddenly has twice as much HP and is doing twice as much damage than the last time I killed it. And if I can't kill it (why would I want to do that again?), Blizzard will nerf it for me until I can.<br />
<br />
Just remove the debuff - The magical argument that people somehow seem to forget and all of a sudden all these excuses to not be a special snowflake crumbles.. Like a cookie.<br />

You have the luxury of choice and the blue has already said it - Turn off the debuff. <br />
<br />
Your view of him losing the argument is starting to sound like when people claimed SWOTOR would kill WoW. Look at how that went.<br />

<br />
I don't think people want to deny anyone content. They just want a difficulty curve that goes reasonably high so as to reward people who take the time to master the game to some degree. <br />
<br />
A lot of the EU thread is centred on the nerfs to Heroic difficulty - nothing to do with LFR or Normal. <br />
<br />
However you can argue that the TBC model of progression meant people were less likely to run out of content so very quickly, but that is a different argument. A lot of people liked that model not because it is elitist, but because it was a fun and steady climb and once your guild advanced enough you could move on to the next raid and there was an amazing sense of accomplishment. It did mean people could miss the final dungeon until after the expansion, which sucked, but other areas were very good.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, it was fun and steady with nerfs coming in rolling like they are now. I did BT Pre-nerf and i had a possible go at SW if i wanted - but i didn't go for it. Maybe it's time to not have time cause you delusions and rose tinted googles are to be put away? Because It sure as hell was not a &quot;Steady climb&quot;. <br />
<br />
There was the casual guilds who only did Kara cause they could not amass the players nor skill to clear SSC or TK - Let alone BT or SW. And it's funny to think how you go to say &quot;There was an amazing sense of accomplishment&quot; - There was the normal nerd scream. And there were the nerfs. Stop posting in delusion, thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My thoughts exactly. This is the reason why a) I don't play Diablo3 anymore, even though I was mad with expectations and it is a very enjoyable game in its core, something about 'you get NOTHING for your devoted playtime and skill, just pay and you will win' doesn't appeal to me, and b) I am more than glad to come back to WoW after a 6 month break, my warlock may be 7 years old but I sure love to play that bony old behind :D</div></div><hr />

Special snowflakes? Cause wanting to beat other players/guilds is now a bad thing(?). The blue defenders will all see though after a few months of MoP how very little there will be left to do. I never played it but I hear constantly that Swtor failed due to a lack of end game, WoW will have a lack of end game due to how quickly you can complete it all.

What argument is he losing ? What discussion is there ? Some players have stated how they want the game, the CM stated the company line. So where is the argument ? They are just stating the same things again and again.<br />
And what do they even expect from a CM ? Do they really think at some point he will use his awesome CM powers and change the game back into TBC ? He submitted their feedback so why continue that thread ? What´s the point ?<br />
<br />
And honestly, if you look at the actual thread, it´s the same 10 òr so players arguing with him there for 160+ pages. Do those 10 people really need such a big featuring every day ?</div></div><hr />

As for SWTOR, duh. It was obvious from launch, except for certain over zealous people on these forums, that that game did not have legs. It was woefully lacking content, having the all so typical single player game leveling path, and launched three patches too early. They will be lucky to be around in two years time. Unlike another big name title that was force F2P (LOTRO) they don't have a variety of leveling paths and that just dooms the game.<br />

<br />
Well, I got my Cenarion Hippogryph in a PvP realm, at the start of the WotLK, when I first entered WoW. Of course there was no one interested in Coilfang, and there was no way to farm it with the gear and level available at the time. Yet, I got addicted to Noggenfogger, and farmed ears on the lake at Borean Tundra until I finally earned my Hippogryph.<br />
<br />
I had a really hard time, and worked my ass out for a mount that pissed off Alliance back then.<br />
<br />
TODAY any noob can wipe out Coilfang with ease, and earn that mount. Still that don't diminishes my effort and my Cenarion War Hippogryph stay up now, my favorite mount of all time. Because I DID IT, It was Hard and few had the guts to do so. The easy way people get it today don't retroactively ruin my conquest.<br />
<br />
Seriously, if you measure yourself by how the others can't reach something, instead of how hard YOURSELF had to work to get it, the problem is only YOURS. You can whine to end of time, and be in constant distress, or you can learn to enjoy yourself. <br />
<br />
First option ends with you working hard for no pleasure, while everyone else have patience, work light and get pleasure. Second option ends with you working hard, other having patience and getting stuff easily, and BOTH enjoying it. <br />
<br />
BOTTOM LINE IS: Blizzard will not make things in a different way if the only thing preventing everyone from enjoying the game are the players themselves. They are doing their work of giving a shot to every kind of player, each at a time. So, get the train when it's at your station. Complaining it just don't sit there forever, and everyone else should walk to your station to board a stagnant car only works if you ignore a lot of obvious consequences, and that in any way is not smart.</div></div><hr />

The point is not in removing the debuff,that debuff should never been there in first place,at least for hc modes,and thats what people are asking. HC modes to stay same for everyone.

Should've locked the thread and ended it because any productive discussion ended long ago. <br />
<br />
The players can whine all they want--they are a minority. LFR and LFD have been tremendously successful. Truly hardcore raiders, if you believe the QQ in the forums (and believe the claims of hardcore-ness, which are rarely backed up by proof) often speak about contentment in the game (Ensidia's blogs, for example, often feature how pleased they were with the difficulty of heroic, etc.). The eventual nerfing of content really has no negative effects. None. And when the stacking debuff can be voluntarily dismissed and people say, &quot;well, that's not fair, they're getting the same gear I have but I worked harder for it,&quot; it's not about personal accomplishment--because that hasn't changed, you DID work harder for it, good for YOU--it's about keeping others down.<br />
<br />
Which is impossible for these people to see, as is evidenced by pages and pages. So when posters accuse the blue of &quot;not listening,&quot; what they're really getting upset about is that Blizzard &quot;doesn't agree with me,&quot; which is TOO BAD, ERMAGERD.<br />
<br />
Seriously. When did disagreeing with someone become the same thing as not listening?<br />
<br />
In terms of the &quot;there never should be a debuff in the first place, HC should remain HC forevar (tm)&quot; argument, I would agree except that some HC fights really are vastly different from their regmode counterparts, which adds a new level of fun to experiencing them. I don't think, at the end of an expansion, it's a particularly bad tactic to make 'new' content exclusive, especially when it's around for months and months and months and the gear gained will be rendered completely insignificant outside transmog purposes with the next xpac.<br />
<br />
I'm with others in this thread, irl, etc...these folks on the official forums sound like emokids, whether they are or aren't in actuality. It's not like LFR is handing out heroic-level gear. And it's not like there still isn't a MARKED difficulty difference between heroic and LFR. You can say what you want but this whole debate really does reek of Special Snowflake Syndrome--ie, I only care about my shinies if they're exclusive.<br />
<br />
But really, in response to the whole thread from the start (which reeked of a blizzard witch-hunt by QQers), I quote Peter Griffin. &quot;OH MY GOD WHO. THE HELL. CARES!?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The disc mount is nifty, but I wish the cloud underneath were toggle-able.<br />
<br />
Saw the SWTOR thing coming a mile away. The new model for online games these days is to make money off micro-transactions. &quot;F2P&quot; is a massive lie, much of the time. I'd much rather have a stock monthly fee than feel obligated to spend a small fortune on things that look good, upgrades that are game-breaking, bonus xp, and the whole list of f2p usual-suspects. I don't think F2P will save TOR, though. It just...it plays like a single player game, the group stuff isn't particularly compelling. The stories are very hit-or-miss in terms of interest level, and the voice acting was a colossal waste of time and resources because everybody I know, even the lorewhores like me, eventually started skipping the dialogue because OH MY GOD DO THESE PEOPLE EVER SHUT UP.</div></div><hr />

I personally have stopped reading the blue posts, except the ones having anything to do with warriors or monks. They just get me on a bad mood and I lose all my faith in WoW if I read them.

Yeah, if WoW did the same thing with valor points or a new currency, I'd quit.

<br />
They were never &quot;gunning&quot; for WoW's spot. They were going for greater success than they achieved, but not every company or any of them really have a goal of overtaking WoW. I am sure it would make them feel nice, but any realistic designer would see that no game can come out and be instantly &quot;better&quot; than WoW. The only thing that will &quot;kill&quot; WoW is WoW itself. It has had time to mature and add more and more new content/features/improved systems. <br />
<br />
SWTOR technically is not free 2 play. I see people calling it this everywhere, but it is only free to play with a lot of restrictions. It is basically a very large trial or demo. We all know that a great MMO is not just based on the leveling content, but also its additional features like dungeons, pvp, economy, minigames, and all around customization. Playing SWTOR for free does not allow you to Raid and limits your participation in the other areas I mentioned. For casuals that can only get on and level or do a dungeon or two a week, it may be great and I guess you could classify it as F2P for them, but in the classical sense, I would heavily argue that it is still not F2P.<br />
<br />
They are basically giving everyone a chance to experience their hard work on the stories in the game, the single player game, but if you want to play the MMO version, pay up. It is sad that they took so long to get the group finder out. It actually feels like an MMO now and doesn't just play like a single player game anymore for subscribing. :-/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even when the blue just gave the correct argument, ppl didn't notice what they should show to prove their claims.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, but not everyone is interested in the raid race and just want to experience the encounters at the pace they can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Exactly. By nerfing content as soon as a guild in the world kills the boss for the 1st time (like they basically did in FL when someone finally killed heroic Rag), they forbid the rest of the player base to experience that encounter at their pace. Now they'll have to deal with the nerfed version of it, because one guild in the world did it. <br />
<br />
A small number of players told me how I should deal with Firelands for all the months left until new content came out.<br />
<br />
That's why world 1st guilds &quot;do not complain&quot; that much. They could do the deal at their pace, nobody came before them and made Blizzard change the settings while they were playing.<br />
<br />
And Blizzard noticed that and changed to the &quot;optional&quot; debuff in DS (that you can only choose &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, there is no 1 stack, 2 stacks... and I'm not sure, but once disabled, can you enable it again or still need to wait for a new raid lock like it was in ICC?). But let's all be honest here, it only works for single player games. You can't expect to convince 9 or 24 other players to play the way YOU want.<br />
<br />
That way Blizzard nerf it and just throw the problem at you and your friends/raid members. For instance, in DS (and ICC) I just take the nerfs as something that I can't remove, because I don't want to start a discussion with my friends and other raid members expecting to make them do what I want. So yes, Blizzard just denied me to play at my pace, because now I need to kill it ASAP or GTFO and deal with it and accept that I'm somehow stupid, bad and etc. because I didn't play at the same pace of the guild that killed it 1st and changed the content for the others.<br />
<br />
Some players will just take to the challenge as long as Blizzard let them and since WoW isn't a single player game and you need 9 or 24 other players... well. Games with cash shop/AH (hi Diablo 3) are there to prove it. There are lot of players that will get shortcuts to remove most of the challenge (in Diablo, getting geared to deal with the acts is part of the challenge, it's basically all the game is actually).</div></div><hr />

I have NEVER seen that before! And it seems to be happening alot lately. Draztal is literally arguing his point as an employee of Blizzard with players of the game. And not just a few points with professional criticism based on inside information, but several pages worth of BS based solely on his own personal beliefs. <br />
<br />
If I didn't see the blue text, I would have sworn it was another player. There are typos and grammar mistakes all over the place. I feel embarrassed reading it.<br />
<br />
He's a CM,(community manager), he is allowed to have an opinion you know,Would be some shitty community if all he did was agree with everyone, or well we would end up with no blue posters on the forums, would you prefer that? Blizz just cannot win. and to be honest the way the players spoke, the way the questions were put forward is disgusting, you'd think they were children with no manners. He has a right to stick up for himself and the company he works for.<br />
<br />

I personally have stopped reading the blue posts, except the ones having anything to do with warriors or monks. They just get me on a bad mood and I lose all my faith in WoW if I read them. That's how unprofessional the blue posters are. They just want to force their _opinions_ down the throat of the playerbase. I would be fired from my job if I'd suck on my job as much as some of the Blizzards employees. Where's all the quality required nowadays? Look at G4S on London olympics too : DD.<br />
<br />
Wait, they put you in a bad mood for having an -opinion- , sure its not because they are disagreeing with your opinion? Nothing wrong with that, not everyone agrees with one another, would be a bloody boring world if we did.<br />
<br />
As for the forcing of opinions down peoples throats, you mean like the hundreds of players that shove THEIR opinions down all of our throats everytime they open their gobs on the forums here or on the official forums, declaring the latest drivel they think they are entitled to on a daily basis? <br />
<br />

Oh yes, it was fun and steady with nerfs coming in rolling like they are now. I did BT Pre-nerf and i had a possible go at SW if i wanted - but i didn't go for it. Maybe it's time to not have time cause you delusions and rose tinted googles are to be put away? Because It sure as hell was not a &quot;Steady climb&quot;. <br />
<br />
There was the casual guilds who only did Kara cause they could not amass the players nor skill to clear SSC or TK - Let alone BT or SW. And it's funny to think how you go to say &quot;There was an amazing sense of accomplishment&quot; - There was the normal nerd scream. And there were the nerfs. Stop posting in delusion, thanks.<br />
<br />
Yes - just remove the debuff, and while you are at it stop enchanting and gemming your gear, stop using the best items and the best talents - can you see where your line of reasoning is going? I see no difference between telling someone to drop the buff and telling someone to 'self-nerf' themselves in other ways.<br />
<br />
As far as 'rose tinted goggles' - I put in my post the caveat that TBC progression had its drawbacks. I just pointed out in some very important ways it was vastly superior. <br />
<br />
The casual guild comment is quite a cheap shot in relation to TBC. You and I both know that TBC raiding didn't really support 10man raids - it was something added on the side. If they hypothetically used the TBC progression model today, then you would still have 10 mans and LFR. Yes it would be a mountain to climb to reach the final boss, but with 10 man raids and the LFR feature even casual raiding guilds and unguilded people could climb it if they wanted. <br />
<br />
Just have to use a bit of common sense rather then assuming TBC would be copy/pasted into a modern setting.</div></div><hr />

The challenge is there. Oh, you don't want to run without the buff... such a huge surprise.<br />
And people being butthurt from LFR items that are so much worse than normal/heroic.<br />
<br />
There's a reason Blizzard doesn't listen to these players, they can't put shit into perspective at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where did the challenge go?&quot;<br />
<br />
I suppose you missed the fact that your raid teams average ilvl has increased by 20-30 since patch 4.3?<br />
Or that there's an increasing buff, designed to help struggling guilds progress and you to clear already cleared content quicker.<br />
<br />
I frankly don't know what is wrong with this community, there must be some kind of fatal flaw in the whiners sense of putting things into perspective or heck, for once taking gearing into account.

<br />
Blue posters know little about civil. When they answer with like three words based on the blue's personal opinion, not facts, not what the majority of the players want. I don't mind them thinking differently than me, I know the game wont be the way I want it to be. Which is having challenge. I don't have a special snowflake syndrome, I don't want any achievements telling that I killed everything pre-nerf. I just want challenging content when I progress trough the game. I raid 4 times a week, 4 hours a day and I find this game being really easy and I kill everything before nerfs. So I'm far away from the so called HC players what comes to the time I use on WoW. Pvp is just bullsht and I wont even bother, getting gladiator isn't the hard part, having the right comp and having friends playing the right classes is. <br />
<br />
Blue's even let the players do the sim's and other forms of theorycrafting. There's an answer of &quot;go simulate it for us&quot; on so many blue posts. Do it yourselves Blizzard, if you can. I do my job well in real life, why doesn't Blizzard? I don't pick my nose when there's work to be done and just say that someone else should go and do it. Propably if there's an overpowered class/spec in MoP, Blizzard will blame the players for not testing : D.<br />
<br />
Also I do agree with you that there's hell of alot posters in the forums that are even more bad than the blue's. But it isn't an excuse to give such biased &quot;answers&quot; and really answering nothing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">subanark</div><div class="date">2012-08-01, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many of those other MMOs simply don't innovate, or at least aren't good at it. Blizzard knows what is likely to be good and they try it out getting closer to that ideal MMO environment. They also recognize when someone else puts out a system that is good and know how to incorporate it into theirs. Finally, they know what features they should avoid putting in their game to keep a level playing field. Many other games don't do this. They simply see &quot;feature X looks cool&quot; without considering the long term effects. What I've noticed of WoW is:<br />
<br />
1. The game rewards skill and dedication, while avoiding the need to excessively grind. Rewards are more gear initially, and mounts/titles/pets at mile stones and when you complete content.<br />
2. Players have a baseline of how prepared they should be before raid. Players can give it their 100% on every boss (none of this abilities that have long CDs anymore).<br />
3. Hard bosses are not long bosses. Having to spend 2 hours to kill a boss isn't a show of skill, nor is it fun. Pretty much all bosses in wow take 8-15 minutes to kill.<br />
4. Players can catch up if they aren't around since the beginning. There is no extra advancement after max level. I've seen too many games do this, which puts the bar higher for other players.<br />
5. They know when to take features out that are counter productive. They can recognize what the majority of players want and not just who complains the most on the forums.<br />
<br />
The problems I've seen with wow that can be improved:<br />
1. Leveling professions is in a bad place. Many professions cannot be leveled to an appropriate level while leveling for new players. This stems from, the fact that they have made leveling faster, but not professions. There is no overlap from classic to BC for the 300 range. Getting to 300 before you hit BC content is very difficulty. The reliance on other materials requires using the AH, which for many low level items is quite inflated since if you want to restart a profession, you need to farm up all the old mats to do so. The 1-300 should have places with multi skill point gains. Players should be given a way to level a profession without relying on gathering materials that are below their level.<br />
2. BGs aren't don't have a good balanced reward system. Doing non-rated BGs grants bonus conquest once per day instead of 7 times per week like dungeons. There is no bonus money for completing dungeons, nor do they give any gear low level. Honor gains encourage letting the other team win to get the match over if it is unlikely your team can win. There are many places where one team has achieved an overwhelming lead, but they won't win for a good while (e.g. your in AB and down 600-1000, as long as the other team controls at least 2 bases they will win, but it will take slightly under 1/2 the game to do so).</div></div><hr />

<br />
See, this keeps popping up every week or so and people don't realize the implications: Even in more serious guilds only one in ten or twenty-five -if at all- cares about the challenge. Obviously, those guys should just waddle off and form their own guild while the rest of the world just farms along...<br />

<br />
These buthurting players are the reason why normal and HC got nerfed! Those player thinking that they deserve those epics regardless of the fact that they DO NOT WANT to improve their own gameplay skills to overcome the difficulty of the normal or heroic version of the instance.<br />
<br />
If you do not want to overcome the difficulty itself with improving yourself (your own skill), to overcome the challenge then you certainly cannot demand you have a right for the end reward (better epics than LFR one). <br />
<br />
It is the exact same mentali6y of those who beg for gold in game and people DO NOT LIKE THAT and most people won't give even one copper piece to those. Yet Blizz devs are doing exactly that. They &quot;give free gold to beggers&quot; just because they QQ they do not have any of it.<br />
<br />
Learning the game, class and spec should be the main focus for everyone. For raid content even in LFR, Learning cooperation should be the main focus of it and not to demand, you have a right for a reward 'because you pay a subscription fee. <br />
<br />
There is no need to nerf normal and heroic versions of the raids. There is LFR, but Blizz devs are to be blamed as they implemented it in half ass job with only final tier of the Cata expansion. <br />
<br />
5m heroic should be a way to compensate for the &quot;lack of raid gear&quot;, yet Blizz devs are to blind to make more natural gear progression as they always make content obsolete with just stupid design decisions. No wonder there is no content if Blizz intentional make it that most playes would skip 80% of it.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. The hypocracy is so evident, yet no one cares. <br />
<br />
On another note: I have yet to see a player quitting this game or another MMORPG because &quot;he/she couldn´t do all the content within x amount of time&quot;. Never, nowhere. What I have seen a lot is players quitting because they have nothing to do or feel like the game designers took away parts they enjoyed.<br />

IF you choose to not disable the nerfbuff, you do NOT receive any titles nor mounts for completing heroic modes. The titles and mounts would only remain if the raid is completed in its original level of difficulty. <br />
<br />
I think this might solve a lot of the problems this is causing. And this is something I think Blizzard should really consider. The mounts and titles are in no way relevant to &quot;seeing the content&quot;, so, everyone can still see the content, just not get the perks that come without the nerf.</div></div><hr />

If the crybabies win this argument, all that is going to happen is that there will be 1 raid per expansion that never gets fixed... instead, there will be heroic 5 mans added every few weeks, and a ton of Molten Front type events every month. The only reason we get the amount of raids we get, and the amount of $´s spent on raids is because they are accessible by the majority of players now. If they win, and want to be special snowflakes, then they are going to be crying about not enough content..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because rewards are not the &quot;content&quot; people are talking about. People seem to not understand that .5% getting a mount does not keep me out of 50% of those battlegrounds and arena locations. There is no comparison. I don't expect to get a Firehawk or one of those Alexstrazsa drakes, but I sure do expect to have a chance to beat a few raid bosses whether LFR, Normal, or Heroic. If I couldn't, say, enter Twin Peaks because I was not &quot;good enough&quot; to handle the battleground, then yes, there would be a comparison. That is not the case, I still get to see the same Twin Peaks that those 2200 are using in Rated. The fact it has variable difficulty (based on the player skill and comp) rather then static difficult (What Blizzard tunes it out based on gear) further makes the comparison moot, PVP naturally nerfs itself while PVE does not.<br />
<br />
<br />
On another note: I have yet to see a player quitting this game or another MMORPG because &quot;he/she couldn´t do all the content within x amount of time&quot;. Never, nowhere. What I have seen a lot is players quitting because they have nothing to do or feel like the game designers took away parts they enjoyed.<br />
<br />
And I have seen the exact opposite. Actually, Cataclysm saw most of my friends leave the game because of overly difficult heroics. There is only a pattern because you want to see one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even when the blue just gave the correct argument, ppl didn't notice what they should show to prove their claims.<br />
<br />
&quot;Of course, but not everyone is interested in the raid race and just want to experience the encounters at the pace they can.&quot;<br />
<br />
Exactly. By nerfing content as soon as a guild in the world kills the boss for the 1st time (like they basically did in FL when someone finally killed heroic Rag), they forbid the rest of the player base to experience that encounter at their pace. Now they'll have to deal with the nerfed version of it, because one guild in the world did it. <br />
<br />
A small number of players told me how I should deal with Firelands for all the months left until new content came out.<br />
<br />
That's why world 1st guilds &quot;do not complain&quot; that much. They could do the deal at their pace, nobody came before them and made Blizzard change the settings while they were playing.<br />
<br />
And Blizzard noticed that and changed to the &quot;optional&quot; debuff in DS (that you can only choose &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, there is no 1 stack, 2 stacks... and I'm not sure, but once disabled, can you enable it again or still need to wait for a new raid lock like it was in ICC?). But let's all be honest here, it only works for single player games. You can't expect to convince 9 or 24 other players to play the way YOU want.<br />
<br />
That way Blizzard nerf it and just throw the problem at you and your friends/raid members. For instance, in DS (and ICC) I just take the nerfs as something that I can't remove, because I don't want to start a discussion with my friends and other raid members expecting to make them do what I want. So yes, Blizzard just denied me to play at my pace, because now I need to kill it ASAP or GTFO and deal with it and accept that I'm somehow stupid, bad and etc. because I didn't play at the same pace of the guild that killed it 1st and changed the content for the others.<br />
<br />
Some players will just take to the challenge as long as Blizzard let them and since WoW isn't a single player game and you need 9 or 24 other players... well. Games with cash shop/AH (hi Diablo 3) are there to prove it. There are lot of players that will get shortcuts to remove most of the challenge (in Diablo, getting geared to deal with the acts is part of the challenge, it's basically all the game is actually).<br />
<br />
<br />
And if you read, the blue even admitted that that was a valid argument. He even sounded like he agreed that the buffs occurred too early with DS and FL. Someone had pointed out that with DS, many guilds had a hard time raiding over the Christmas vacation and were just really getting started.. and then the debuffs started.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard would acknowledge that error if it was presented and would start the buffs much later in the tier. The problem is I only saw it mentioned one time, and then it just got swallowed up by the people saying there should never be a debuff and that bad players should be happy to have normal mode.<br />
<br />
The problem is, and with things like politics, very few people debate ´in the middle´ or are practical about finding a solution. Instead we have 10 players dominating a thread saying there should never be a debuff and LFR ruined the game. <br />
<br />
I do think the debuffs came too fast this expansion and that they ramped them up to fast also.</div></div><hr />

Oh look. They are. Everyone and their mom has 8/8hc, it's even pugged easily. And still the special-PVP-1%-snowflakes get their special titles and rewards.<br />
<br />
annnnd.. you are wrong. LFR is for people who don´t want to ´really´ raid to see the content.<br />
<br />
The debuffs are for guilds that want to progress to continue to be able to progress. This is the part that the snowflakes don´t get. There are a ton of guilds that got 3/8 normal and then hit a wall for a month. They get a 5% debuff.. they then go 6/8 normal and again hit a wall. Finally, right now, they are 6/8 hc. That guild has stayed together because they are progressing. If there had been no debuff, what do you want, them to run 3/8N for 6 months?<br />
<br />
Two very different things, the purpose of LFR and the debuff.<br />
<br />
Also, you are entirely wrong about 8/8 hc being puggable and the number of players who have seen it. The devs have the numbers, you don´t.</div></div><hr />

This is wrong. It would be possible to make a game where only 1% of the playerbase can see raids. That game would have 500 quests added every month, 10 heroic 5 mans added every month, and 1 raid added every expansion. The amount of dev resources devoted to content is always going to be in direct relationship to the amount of players doing it. You want to be the 1%.. congratulations, you get 1% of the devs time.. which would get you about 1 raid per expansion.</div></div><hr />

One server doth not a norm make. My main server can barely stitch together an 8/8 REG DS clear in trade. They're too busy arguing over politics in trade and equipping leather as DKs.<br />

This is sorta what the crux of the argument is and why PvP--PvE is a different argument. What Gro didn't mention is that there is little or no lasting lore/story with associated with PvP. The events in PvE raids, however, are pretty much the pivotal happenings of the WoW storyline.<br />
<br />
ALL THAT SAID...I personally, even though I despise the whole special snowflake attitude, wish they would just keep heroic completely untouched, seeing as putting a toggle-able buff/nerf isn't enough to appease the whiners. Leave heroic mode for those people who can't get an erection unless they feel like they have something nobody else has.</div></div><hr />

8/8h pugs with very VERY strict invite policies in regards to gear / achievements. They're on my realm too. Maybe we're on the same realm? It's hardly a PUG when most of the players are the same and they're just finding a few people to fill the gaps. We were short one week and brought in TWO new players and got 7/8h with only a few wipes. 8 Strong players can carry two for sure.</div></div><hr />

I would have mentioned it, but I worried it would gather those that go &quot;LOL STORY!?&quot; and open a different can of worms. It's true though that when it comes to story, everyone should be able to see the proper conclusion to it.<br />
<br />
When it comes to hardmodes, I am also fine if they decide never to do the debuff. Then again, I am also fine with them removing all the loot and just making Challenge Mode-esque transmog gear drop in Heroic. I think in the end the new achievements for completing it without the debuff while the raid is current is a decent enough motivator.</div></div><hr />

Yes this is how you technically should handle the issue, but you run into some problems. The biggest being a lot of people play with their friends and sometimes their friends just SUCK and there isn't much they can do about it unless they want to rock the boat, so the debuffs really help to keep people like that together.<br />
<br />
Another is the fact that the people may never be able to do a boss at a certain difficult ever because they are just that bad, and most human beings don't seem particularly willing to get better so it just makes more sense to just nerf it for the people unwilling to work and the people that are actually good get everything way faster. I personally don't understand the unwillingness to work hard to raid, but I don't think most of the player base really gives a fuck.</div></div><hr />

Our guild has &quot;too many cooks in the kitchen&quot; syndrome - everyone thinks they know the right way to do things, so we try each of their strats and they all fail. Then 3 hours have passed and we call it a night. And it happens most nights. I like the debuff because it avoids having to deal with that kind of night multiple times a week. If I want to be on an organized team with some sort of captain, I'll join a sports team.<br />

To you it maybe the only reason, to a lot of people it's not. I have never max leveled in any MMO besides WoW even tho I've played almost all of them, and even WoW took me 4 years to finally get just 1 character to 85.<br />
<br />
There is so much more to these games then blowing through content if you stop and actually look. Hell Lotro's ingame music system had me entertained for months learning how to use it to the fullest. EQ2's betrayal quests were fun to do a couple times.

I completely agree. It´s not about rewards, it´s about having something to do. <br />
I don´t care about some rare gladiator mount. I don´t care about some rare hardmode mount or title. But i do care about having something to do in the game. In Classic and BC the majority of new content in patches were raids and if your guild couldn´t do them then bam, you´re out of content for the next 1,5 years till the next expansion. And when i have nothing left to do in the game i cancel my subscription.<br />
That´s why making content exclusively for the 1% is bad for your business.<br />

In my opinion thats the second time the big publishers make this mistake. At first everyone tried to copy WoW in hope of getting new players but at some point they realised that the player number that is interested in a WoW-like MMO is limited.<br />
And now they act as if there is a unlimited number of people who pay in F2P games. The people who are interested in spending money in F2P games is limited, too and just because LotrO and DDO managed to get a good number of those people it doesn´t mean that every game that goes F2P becomes a second LotrO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For some guilds, it does happen. They get everything together and defeat the bosses. The issue is sometimes you can't fix a rusty wheel, leading to the biggest problem and why they ultimately do this.<br />
<br />
Let me start out by saying I have been in many guilds over the years. When I started playing WoW I was in a guild mostly made up of all my friends. We had a lot of fun leveling, questing, doing dungeons. It was a blast.<br />
<br />
Then one of my best friends, the GM, wanted to start raiding. We attempted a few MC runs and kept wiping. My friend really wanted to progress, so he looked to another guild farther along in the progression. After some work, he convinced that other guild to basically &quot;merge&quot; with out guild, which meant all of us had to leave the guild we were comfortable and mix with a bunch of strangers. We didn't find this too bad at the time, until the other guild officers decided that most of our players were not good enough to raid, leaving most of them out. More and more they whittled out all of us, until only my friend, the GM, was allowed on the run. Soon after that most of us were kicked.<br />
<br />
We attempted to go back to the old guild, but our morale was so utterly decimated we decided to retire it and go our separate ways. All because of raid drama due to progression. Is that really what you want guilds to focus on? Not friends or input, but &quot;They are the weakest links, throw them out so we can get some real players in here&quot; because that is what is sometimes required to reach the top.<br />
<br />
Nearly all through BC I didn't even have a guild, because every guild I joined wanted me to be attuned (I joined maybe six over the lifespan of the expansion). I was not at the time attuned or attuned for smaller raids, but they wouldn't run me through the attunements and left it up for me to pug. I worked my rear off getting attuned for Kara for one guild, through pugging, but by that point they moved on and no longer wanted to do Kara. What is extra sad is all these guilds (yes, all of them) quickly had their best healers and tanks &quot;poached&quot; by farther progress guilds, the rest trickled away to other semi-progressive guilds leaving only the stragglers like me. Another guild turned into an empty husk of nothing.<br />
<br />
WOTLK was the first time I saw guilds, for the most part, stay together well on the whole, as raids like Naxxramas were not extremely punishing. Since each patch brought up the heroics and stuff to outfit for the newer raids, more and more people were &quot;keeping up&quot; with the guild and were kept along, even if they were not the best players. To be honest, other then some elitist junk with Gearscore, was what I considered the most successful raiding expansion from the eyes of a casual player looking for cool friendly people to play with, not a second job with a boss evaluating my performance with a weekly review.<br />
<br />
In the end, different strokes for different folks, but as far as I am concerned the vanilla and BC raiding scene was the absolute worst. It was only enjoyable if you had an extremely tight knit group, played perfectly, and never left to go on vacation. You fell behind on the progression, you were replaced and they often never looked back.</div></div><hr />

Wait, they put you in a bad mood for having an -opinion- , sure its not because they are disagreeing with your opinion? Nothing wrong with that, not everyone agrees with one another, would be a bloody boring world if we did.<br />
<br />
As for the forcing of opinions down peoples throats, you mean like the hundreds of players that shove THEIR opinions down all of our throats everytime they open their gobs on the forums here or on the official forums, declaring the latest drivel they think they are entitled to on a daily basis? <br />
<br />
Sorry but at least the Blue's give their opinions in a way that is civil. Even when dealing with idiots. Where as I can't say the same for the majority of those Questions asked by the vocal minority on the official forums.<br />
<br />
Please, have a think before you start bashing folks.<br />
<br />
He dosent have an opinion, hed say black was white if Blizzard told him to say it. He is merely quoting Blizzard flawed policy, and is getting caught out repeatively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because YOU think their policy is flawed, does NOT mean it really is flawed, What makes your opinion more important than anyone elses, what makes your opinion fact over anyone elses?<br />
<br />
Sorry but I'm going to take their word and facts over any random player posting on the forums, They have the numbers data, they know what they are saying, I'm not saying they don't get things wrong from time to time (we all get things wrong, blizz are still human beings), but the way you people make them out to be the big bad monster is unreal.<br />
<br />
If they stopped posting on the forums altogether, you would complain they weren't as involved, and didn't care. They do post on the forums, but tell you what you don't want to hear, so they don't care. They just cannot win. <br />
<br />

If he didn't believe what he is saying, he wouldn't post at all. He is a CM, the farthest his job needs to extend is answering the rare question and deleting spam. The fact he is posting is because this discussion is one he feels strongly about, just not in the way you guys want.</div></div><hr />

Is it the CM's fault that people are unreasonable and whine constantly about everything, so that the blues feel they need to keep holding their hands and explaining things over and over, perhaps hoping one day it might eventually sink in.<br />
<br />
If the CM didn't agree with Blizzard, he would just NOT post, so the fact he has posted, kinda tells me he does understand, and sympathise on certain points made, but not with others. <br />
<br />
These people (vocal minority on the forums) are the kind of people the world needs to stop listening too, the ones that are constructive and know how to behave in a discussion are doing it right. The ones that do nothing but try to inflame, and incite drama, with their sarcasm and disdain need to just walk away.</div></div><hr />

They'd probably go try to find another more unique transmog set.<br />

If you change that I personally would quit since no raiding title holds any value by then, nor does any level of gear( I don't know about you guys but I liked being complemented by others about my high gear level). I'm fine with normal and LFR being easy as it is, as long as you don't make LFR mandatory for my main/ alt's I'm fine, That would imply I'd rather see no tier pieces drop in LFR or make those also buyable with valor points ( since I ran like 20 runs on some alts and still getting none tier piece makes a man desperate). <br />
<br />
And if that is not doable please make a Super Mega Ultra Heroic mode for the hardcore raiders with a higher gear level and a special title, so we pathetic humans have something to do to make us feel special in our lives.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isilbêth</div><div class="date">2012-08-01, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some guilds, it does happen. They get everything together and defeat the bosses. The issue is sometimes you can't fix a rusty wheel, leading to the biggest problem and why they ultimately do this.<br />
<br />
Let me start out by saying I have been in many guilds over the years. When I started playing WoW I was in a guild mostly made up of all my friends. We had a lot of fun leveling, questing, doing dungeons. It was a blast.<br />
<br />
Then one of my best friends, the GM, wanted to start raiding. We attempted a few MC runs and kept wiping. My friend really wanted to progress, so he looked to another guild farther along in the progression. After some work, he convinced that other guild to basically &quot;merge&quot; with out guild, which meant all of us had to leave the guild we were comfortable and mix with a bunch of strangers. We didn't find this too bad at the time, until the other guild officers decided that most of our players were not good enough to raid, leaving most of them out. More and more they whittled out all of us, until only my friend, the GM, was allowed on the run. Soon after that most of us were kicked.<br />
<br />
We attempted to go back to the old guild, but our morale was so utterly decimated we decided to retire it and go our separate ways. All because of raid drama due to progression. Is that really what you want guilds to focus on? Not friends or input, but &quot;They are the weakest links, throw them out so we can get some real players in here&quot; because that is what is sometimes required to reach the top.<br />
<br />
Nearly all through BC I didn't even have a guild, because every guild I joined wanted me to be attuned (I joined maybe six over the lifespan of the expansion). I was not at the time attuned or attuned for smaller raids, but they wouldn't run me through the attunements and left it up for me to pug. I worked my rear off getting attuned for Kara for one guild, through pugging, but by that point they moved on and no longer wanted to do Kara. What is extra sad is all these guilds (yes, all of them) quickly had their best healers and tanks &quot;poached&quot; by farther progress guilds, the rest trickled away to other semi-progressive guilds leaving only the stragglers like me. Another guild turned into an empty husk of nothing.<br />
<br />
WOTLK was the first time I saw guilds, for the most part, stay together well on the whole, as raids like Naxxramas were not extremely punishing. Since each patch brought up the heroics and stuff to outfit for the newer raids, more and more people were &quot;keeping up&quot; with the guild and were kept along, even if they were not the best players. To be honest, other then some elitist junk with Gearscore, was what I considered the most successful raiding expansion from the eyes of a casual player looking for cool friendly people to play with, not a second job with a boss evaluating my performance with a weekly review.<br />
<br />
In the end, different strokes for different folks, but as far as I am concerned the vanilla and BC raiding scene was the absolute worst. It was only enjoyable if you had an extremely tight knit group, played perfectly, and never left to go on vacation. You fell behind on the progression, you were replaced and they often never looked back.<br />
<br />
Good analysis, because forum shopping by players between different guilds just because of the speed of the raid progression was a terrible problem back in TBC. It killed many good guilds.<br />
<br />
And, as wrote Kaleredar in another subject : &quot;And then you realized it was a damn video game&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alltat</div><div class="date">2012-08-01, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I feel that heroic mode should only be able to be played out by the best of all players in that patch, say top 5% for a wild guess.

The first thing you need to realize is that you quitting is fine. Because you're the minority. Even if every &quot;hardcore&quot; WoW raider would quit, it wouldn't hurt subscriptions that bad, while if 25% of all casual raiders quit due to lack of content, it would hurt badly.<br />
<br />
The second thing to realize is that the above is not about money (though that's a nice bonus). It's about making a good game, that people enjoy playing. People as in &quot;most people&quot;. WoW was never about hardcore raiding. It's always been an option, but it's never been the point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am going to feel like an old man, but if they really want to be hardcore go play the original EverQuest and camp out for a week waiting for the boss to spawn, only for another guild to swoop in the last minute and take the cool, forcing you to wait another week.<br />
<br />
For all intents and purposes, the original release of WoW was a casualization of the entire genre that came before it.</div></div><hr />

So you have the ability to turn off the nerf to a raid - you just have to convince 9 or 24 other people to do so.<br />
Even if you can't, why can't you just change to a lower ilvl of gear or take off some gems/enchants? That way you are handicapping yourself to make it more of a challenge.</div></div><hr />

Because people don't want challenge, they want prestige. As much as some of the detractors don't want to admit, it always comes back to prestige more then challenge.</div></div><hr />

Because they want a forced challenge for themselves at the expense of everyone else. They will not do it unless they are forced to do it or there is a special snowflake reward for doing it. The funny thing is the top guilds turned off the buff when they did the DS race but they not did get a reward for it.</div></div><hr />

Some of you really need to remove those tinfoil hats you keep wearing.<br />
<br />
It's Blizzard's game and Blizzard's policies. People can say it's flawed or whatever. Big deal; nothing is perfect and just because someone disagrees that doesn't make it wrong. They can do what they like.<br />
<br />
Second point: D3 forums are quite interesting at the moment because Blizzard has, for the most part, stopped talking to that rabble. It's mostly correct to say that if you do post, you only get criticized and if you don't post, you only get criticized. With that bunch of players, not posting makes perfect sense. I've never seen an entire forum sent to its room and grounded for a month but that's the net effect. It's very entertaining at one level; entirely moronic and childish at every other level you can imagine. I'm expecting to hear about a new world-wide shortage of tin any day now due to the number of hats there.</div></div><hr />

If it is about making a good game, why is it that no other game gets easier the worse you play? Why arent they nerfing the content down in their other titles like D3? They realise nerfing content solves nothing and simply puts the wall back up when the next raid tier comes out, but they are stuck trying to stop quitters from quitting.</div></div><hr />

They could be socials in your own guild. They would still be your friends and they could still give input even though you had some real players in there. <br />
If I sucked badly and kept the guild from progressing, I would probably step down and let someone who can make a difference replace me. I'd still be a social and take some time to practice in pugs or whatever. Why should f.ex. 2 friends who are bad hold back your progression? That wouldn't be a nice thing to do. This is the part I'm &quot;passionate&quot; if you like about, if you want to raid you should be required to put effort into it. Be it practicing, gearing or reading strategies. If raiding isn't for you, then there are other things to do. <br />

I can agree WotLK took some steps in the right direction. It also ultimately gave you more to do that was not raiding. Gearscore and later ilvl/achievement requirement for pugs became a way to ensure that you wouldn't spend hours wiping. It also made sure you were somewhat ready for the raid pug you were attempting.<br />

Yep, it's good that people are different. I don't think it was the worst, but I'm sure many agrees to disagree on that. Raiding did require a lot of preparation back then. Something that we'll never see again. Getting flasks, resistance gear etc is what I'm talking about. And yes, they could have made the NR gear required for AQ available somewhere else. Plenty of people also remember mostly the bad stuff, it's apparently what the brain does best. And when someone else remembers something they felt was good, they have rose-tinted glasses on. And yes, some people do have them on, a lot of people will also be right in that they don't have them on.<br />

Here is a nice quote of EA's ex Financial Director Mr Brown in March 16 2011:<br />
<br />
I quote: &quot;That's a very large potential addressable market. We look at it as a tiered opportunity but starting with an addressable market of at least 12 million.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;If we're successful in doing that, our addressable market is well beyond 12 million people,...&quot;<br />

Talking about a failure.<br />
<br />
Interesting detail: Mr Brown resigned 6 weeks after SW TOR launched ...</div></div><hr />

Paladin (Forums)<br />
Judgement is once again a melee attack that has a 30-yard range. (Yes, re-read that to make sure you didn’t misread it...)<br />
<br />
Edit: Judgement is also spelled Judgment now. The developers are playing nasty tricks on me to make sure I'm awake.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not seeing the implementation of Judgment being a melee spell again. Seal of Insight gives the paladin a chance for melee attacks to return 4% base mana. Was pretty excited to see this and went to do some testing it out and nothing. 10 minutes of sitting there casting nothing but Judgment and zero mana return. Hopefully this gets fixed?</div></div><hr />

I´d really hope MMO-C would stop featuring them, it stopped being a discussion long ago and now it´s just a bunch of people throwing accusations at the CM.<br />
Well it doesnt help when the Blue just responds to the more extreme posts or those that they can easily slap a sly remark on. There are a lot of calm and level headed responses, they just get ignored and players are looking for attention and the Blue is giving it to them. That community manager is falling in a trap like many others do and overall is coming off with a bias and they are doing such intentionally in their so called efforts to get players to see the other side while at the same time making them feel like they are worthless, just not a good combination. Community managers like Nethaera on the other hand does a much better job in keeping threads more constructive and instead of picking a side will usually sit in the middle and discus viewpoints of both sides and not make comments that belittle others and treats customers with respect.</div></div><hr />

Im sorry but what did he say that was so offensive or are players made because he doesnt agree with them or kiss their behinds. He replies match the tone of the thread. Many players expect to talk to blizzard that way but not get the same sort of response back.</div></div><hr />
