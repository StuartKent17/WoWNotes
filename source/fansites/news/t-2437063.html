Thanks for all of the continued feedback and discussion around the Azerite Armor system. We’ve been following the community discussions closely, and the systems team has been focusing on making some improvements as their top priority. I’ve got some updates to share on our current thoughts, as well as some upcoming changes.<br />
<br />
To start, here’s some of the bigger issues we’ve been seeing brought up:<br />
<br />
Overall Availability: While there’s plenty of Azerite Armor in the 295-340 item level range, further sources are heavily limited and susceptible to bad luck. Even players who are doing a wide range of high-end content are still wearing at least one Item Level 340 piece, despite having replaced all their other gear several times over. Everything else about the system is basically irrelevant if you can’t get your hands on the gear in the first place. Lack of Agency: When items do drop, it can feel like you’re not really given much in the way of options. You can choose whether you want this to be a Fire or a Frost piece, or a versatile one with a generic trait, but that isn’t necessarily an interesting choice. And when you look at the complete package, those choices don’t often feel like they’re having a meaningful impact on how you play your character. Trait Depth: Several of the traits that are considered the “best” mathematically turn out to be some of the simplest mechanically, which reinforces the sense that the system isn’t really affecting gameplay. <br />
<br />
We agree that those issues need to be resolved. So, here’s a few changes we’re working on:<br />
<br />
<br />
We need to make Azerite Armor more available, for all types of players, through a method everyone can utilize. So we’re actually looking at Emissary rewards for that. The plan is to make Azerite Armor rewards from Emissary quests scale all the way up to 370 (based on your item level), which gives everyone a new, reliable source for appropriate gear. Further on, we’re looking at making some further improvements to the ways Emissaries reward gear, but getting more Azerite Armor in your hands is the higher priority for the immediate future. When we add new Azerite Armor in what we’re calling “BfA Season 2” (starting with Siege of Zuldazar and its corresponding Mythic+ and PvP seasons), we’re going to add another outer ring to those pieces of gear that has two spec-specific trait options for each spec. This effectively means that your favorite traits will be available on a lot more items, while also opening up a lot more options across the scope of all of your Azerite pieces (and thus, we hope, create more interesting decisions). We’re also going to continue to work on the individual traits themselves. We’ve done some basic tuning so far, but we’re taking the lessons we’ve learned from these first iterations forward, and Tides of Vengeance will bring new traits into the pool that reflect that. Our goal is to make the more generic traits be decent middle-of-the-road options for when you want to use a single piece for multiple situations or specs, but make sure the spec-specific options (which are generally the more interesting traits) win out in their respective environments. <br />
<br />
Some of those changes won’t be coming until Tides of Vengeance (and you’ll see them on the PTR soon), but the overall availability of Azerite Armor is a much more pressing concern, so we’re investigating ways of hotfixing that directly into the live game. I don’t have a solid timeline on when that might be yet, but we’ll definitely have more information to share as soon as we can confirm when that can happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. There's always going to be a best choice, the only way to eliminate that is to have the system be trivial or the contribution from the items be so minor that the choice just doesn't matter. <br />
<br />
I think Blizzard is just so disconnected from reality that they can't see the system for what it is; a failure. They need to get over their sunk cost fallacy, scrap the system, and just focus on a different, better system going forward, and yes, that means in this expansion, not just the next one. It's good to try new things, but there comes a point when it's clear the new thing is a flop and the best thing for everyone is to just move on.</div></div><hr />

it will be gone next xpac. and replaced with a similar but different system.<br />

whats important right now is making the current (for the next 1.5 years at least) system better.<br />

giving us more azerite is a start.</div></div><hr />

Because RNG apparently takes longer then grinding, or maybe it's because they don't want to give people what the actually want, meaningful character progression.</div></div><hr />

I think they have moved away, philosophically, from players having control over their gearing in that manner. The Random Number God will decide all. <br />

I wish they would go back to the MoP system. With Valor coming from MANY places with a weekly cap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could just improve the drops from places that actually drop that ilvl loot, but no.<br />
<br />
Also another ring to increase the RNG and the grind to unlock something. The unlocking system is trash and make almost no sense when you start to upgrade your gear.<br />
<br />
And to think that they've received a huge feedback about this system during the alpha/beta... but their &quot;dev pride&quot; was stronger (once more... &quot;they didn't understand how good this is, let them play on live and they'll learn how good it is!&quot;, just like &quot;entire game centered&quot; Garrisons or Legion &quot;Diablo 3&quot; Legendaries...)...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really hit the nail on the head. And since its coming with 8.1, 370 armor is going to be the equivalent of what 340 armor is now. I have no idea why they stubbornly refuse to have armor drop from M+, just have to pray to RNGesus every Tuesday that the M+ cache gives out a good piece. Its such a simple fix and it boggles my mind why they don't already hotfix it in game now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teph</div><div class="date">2018-10-04, 12:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nice, so for example someone is still wearing a 340 shoulder, rest of his items are 380+. Now you have the chance for an azerite emissary, that gives you a 1/3rd chance for shoulders, that have a chance to have not garbage traits.<br />
<br />
I bet they could add a few more layers of rng on there.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telwar</div><div class="date">2018-10-04, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't do anything about the necklace levels. I'm at 22, and my next slots come at 25. That makes me really not feel particularly like grinding out those three levels. At least with artifacts, you got *something* for a level in the artifact, even if it was a slight increase to a proc.</div></div><hr />

1/2/3 drops 340<br />
4/5/6 drops 355<br />
7/8/9 drops 370<br />
10+ drops 385<br />
<br />
but no, they want us to use the Raid Gear even though the Raid Gear has sub-optimal traits on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't forget on top of the RNG now we need to grind out even more AP just to have the same traits we already have on 340 armor. Knowing blizzard it'll probably be 30/35/40/45/50 to for each trait unlocked on a piece of season 2 azerite gear.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard needs to understand that your first impressions are everything now. People unsub and don't come back if an expansion has a weak start. &quot;It'll get fixed, it'll get better isn't enough.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like how the legendary system worked at the end of Legion - you still had the RNG chance to get a drop, but you were also gathering currency to purchase a specific legendary that you want. <br />
<br />
Instead we have traits that don't matter on gear that drops at random and content that doesn't feel rewarding. And they are fixing that by balancing out the traits so that they are all equally dull and weak and having the azerite armor drop from world quests (the most boring endgame activity).<br />
<br />
Okay... Good thing that the content itself is fine, because the class and azerite design levels are unsub-worthy.</div></div><hr />

no the 370 from emmissary is coming sooner than 8.1, and will likely increase again to the heroic level of the new raid.</div></div><hr />

Just accept the system's a failure, move the trait rings onto the necklace for flat unlock costs and go back to tier sets. Call it a day. Listen to your damn community for once.<br />
<br />
OMFG you people, learn to understand game design at some point in your incessant whining.<br />
<br />
<br />
This fixes most if not all the issues with Azerite armor and makes the system alot more interesting to engage with, if they actually deliver what they're aiming for here.<br />

All that is needed beyond this is for them to sit down and really numbercrunch their traits so that they're at least within 5-10% of each other in their given situations.<br />

And I really really really don't like the Azerite system, I'd be much happier if they removed it and called it a loss. But these changes are significant enough that i MIGHT just change my mind. So I'll chose to be hopeful instead of acting like the god damn sky is falling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's why Blizzard does what it does, their solution will not fix anything<br />
<br />
do people are so blind or can't think for themselves that can't see that their solution we may still only see appear the Emissary Reward being a Armor Azerite 2-4 times at max a month and be totally random ?<br />
<br />
oh well in a month people will came back, for now blizzard will get his rest<br />
<br />
Dont be satisfied with so little people and they will continue to give less and less<br />
<br />
Read better people, Its not WQ rewards, Its Emissary reward. How much Emissary Rewards you saw having Azerite Armor since the launch ? Yes it was there if you can't remember or thinking that never was there<br />
<br />
also to confirm part of the response &quot;The plan is to make Azerite Armor rewards from Emissary quests scale all the way up to 370 (based on your item level)&quot; &lt; its not making Azerite Armor available on Emissary, its making Azerite Armor Rewards scale<br />
<br />
so tell me how much Azerite Armor you saw being on Emissary Reward? That will be your response for their solution. I only remember from launch 2 or 3</div></div><hr />

I like that Blizzard is not letting the 5 man Mythic+ &quot;elites&quot; control their design decisions. 5 man content should never drop the best gear in game.<br />
<br />
Exepct it woulnd't - base ilvl for +10's is 370, it would be completly fine if they would drop in m+ since they can't warforge, but you can still farm different builds that are competetive enough for you to play with. It won't take away from raiding, since mythic still provides you higher item level.<br />
Yet people are forced to raid mythic uldir while having m0 gear equiped, just because the only Shoulder/chest, whatever the slot is that only drops 1 time for your armor slot just won't drop.<br />
<br />
There is such an easy &quot;fix&quot; to the accesebility to Azerite gear, but so some arbitrary reason Blizzard refuse to take action.<br />
<br />
Having around 1 extra chance per week to have an emissary spawn with the piece you want, and then relying on RNG for it to have a somewhat desireable trait won't help at all.<br />
<br />
Imagine having no relics drop in Legion m+, and then only 1 idk Iron relic drops in the raid. That would have been outrageous, as it is now with the current availabilty to azerite..</div></div><hr />

This guy be trolling right? There's only a handful of specs that make that have MINOR rotational changes due to the bubbles you click. Still yet instantly want to try it? Sorry but real players sim it so they don't waste thousands and thousands of gold testing something in a raid environment. It's not clear what's the best and 99% of them are boring.

If emissaries provided justice/valor points as a reward then everyone could do them to target upgrades. <br />

Jesus Christ the solution to the availability problem is so fucking obvious<br />

So we’re actually looking at Emissary rewards for that. The plan is to make Azerite Armor rewards from Emissary quests scale all the way up to 370 (based on your item level), which gives everyone a new, reliable source for appropriate gear. Further on, we’re looking at making some further improvements to the ways Emissaries reward gear, but getting more Azerite Armor in your hands is the higher priority for the immediate future.I mean I appreciate what Blizzard is trying to do with this, but it's kind of telling that as I was reading through this my immediate thought was &quot;Wait you can get Azerite pieces from Emissaries?&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, buffing Emissary Azerite drops is nice and all but it's really not gonna have any real impact at all if Emissaries continue to only give a single piece of Azerite every, like, one or two goddamn months.<br />
<br />
That's something that anyone who actually plays the game would've realised the instant that suggestion came up in-office.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tankbug</div><div class="date">2018-10-04, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My own problem with the traits is that they're basically just a key-&gt;value lookup from a user perspective. <br />
Example: <br />
<br />
&quot;Reckless Flurry&quot; -&gt; 1,754 dps<br />
<br />
vs <br />
<br />
&quot;Pulverizing Blows&quot; -&gt; 1,262 dps<br />
<br />
Ok, winner decided, can't even remember exactly what they do. <br />
I wished they would be active skills, or at least something that would influence your rotation in a higher degree, to influence your gameplay in a higher degree. Because at least for now, before I get really into everyone of them, they could basically be just % damage increase.</div></div><hr />

I think the idea sounded good on paper, but after implementing it, you realize that there are so many minor flaws in the system, down to its core, that it can't really be fixed without a complete overhaul, and there aren't going to be enough major patch revisions to really achieve that.<br />
<br />
Like, &quot;you have a few pieces of armor that have Legendary or Artifact style traits that modify your gameplay, and they come from specific sources so you can target the piece you want, and then you can stack the pieces together to build your own set bonuses.&quot; That sounds greatm right?<br />
<br />
<br />
I honestly think the issue is that there are too many Azerite Traits overall. Fewer, more impactful traits across the same amount of gear currently available would have increased your odds of getting the trait you wanted. And I think they should tie trait selection to spec, not gear, so that you don't need to carry extra sets of Azerite Gear for different specs.<br />
<br />
Though, honestly, probably the biggest problem, which is foundational, is that they probably should have put traits on your necklace instead of gear. Maybe give you an option to master the traits you find on gear and add them permanently to a selection wheel on your necklace.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard must have convinced themselves at some point that the instant players get the gear they want, they just immediately unsub. That's honestly the only explanation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People seem to be forgetting some keypoints when they think this change is actually a change. The only good thing about this is that it will have more traits so rng wont play such a huge roll in it. Thats the only good change the other ones does literally nothing.<br />
<br />
Getting azerite from emissarys means that we have 1-3 additional chances to get 370 pieces each MONTH. So they're still insisting on timegating shit which is just so fucking greedy. They can just make it drop from m +10 so people can actually farm it instead, Work towards their gear if you will. Not wait, Waiting is a fucking garbage design. And lets not forget that 370 will be shit in 8.1 so it just means that we have additional chances to get shit gear which equals to our means to farm 340 shit gear from M0. And lets be realistic this change wont happen untill either 8.1 or 1 week before.<br />
<br />
You see? There is only 1 change in here which makes rng play a lesser roll which is fine by me. But they're still refusing to let people work towards the gear they want and are forced to wait weeks on weeks to have a CHANCE to MAYBE get something they want. All up to randomly generated numbers!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does that mean that if we take the current gear as baseline they add another ring with just spec specific traits? Or are more spec-specific traits added to the current outer ring? Because if they add an extra ring we get to choose spec traits from the 2 rings, otherwise we just get to choose 1.<br />
<br />
To be fair neither of these really fix anything because most likely this just means that new gear requires even more and more heart levels to be usefull (aka unlock 3 rings, 2 with spec-specific ones and then the defensive one).<br />
<br />
This doesn't feel like to much of a fix eitherway but I guess they are at least trying something.</div></div><hr />

On an other note i think blizzard should add a black list on item on a weakly reset, at the start of the week you can black list X number of slots and you cant get loot for that slot, so you can keep the RNG but at least you stop getting 370 boots when you have a 385</div></div><hr />

2500 from weekly island expidition cap + 1500 from weekly m+ chest and if you do emissaries you get atleast 400/day = 2800/week, minimum.

I have always hated how they scale rewards from the same activity based upon your iLevel. That has no place in an MMO. Do this simple activity and get some low level gear... What? You have higher iLevel? No problem we'll give you higher end gear, maybe even raid level gear for picking up 10 nuts and clicking on 12 squirrels.<br />

It loses all sense of progression, rising difficulties, challenge, success. It's just &quot;do anything&quot; and we'll give you something for it.<br />

People where unhappy with tokens in wrath, really the currency tab looked bad, way too many different tokens. <br />
With the RNG you might play longer, sure you got the legs you want but the secondary stats could be better so maybe you try again. Also the randomness in getting what you want is a sense of joy that tokens can't give you. Knowing the number of tokens you need for you legs, how many instances and how many days you need for it, then fly to the vendor and buy it that isn't &quot;exciting&quot;.

<br />
In today's game? No difference.<br />
<br />
When WoW was an MMO? Progression WAS killing bosses until you got the gear you needed. Progression was farming/crafting resist sets for certain bosses. Progression meant you couldn't faceroll all the &quot;available wing bosses&quot; in whatever crap gear you got from treasure chests.<br />
<br />
A raid popped with all bosses available... THOSE developers knew you needed to farm the first couple bosses a couple weeks in order to be geared enough to make progress on boss #3.<br />
<br />
Heck in Sunwell people were making trash farming raiding order to eek out some gems and gear upgrades because the tuning was TOUGH. When you can go in and kill every single boss in a wing with whatever gear people have, without everyone having gems/enchants, etc.... it's really not worth anything but some personal loot chance with &quot;bonus rolls&quot;... lol what a joke.<br />
<br />
&quot;Back in the day&quot;... you had a lot of gems needed to complete your gear... enchants, helm/shoulder enchants available only through rep... crafting enchants like belt buckles and leg armor. There were weapon oils and stones. So many things you could go out and gather/craft/obtain/farm... in order to make your character stronger, your raid more powerful... ti was ALL progress.<br />
<br />
But &quot;kids these days&quot; &quot;ain't got no time for dat&quot;. Just lemme walk in and start smackin' bosses and tell me how I am the leader of my class. What garbage. It's no wonder the spoiled brats get mad when they gotta get a little reputation in order to unlock a dungeon.<br />
<br />
This &quot;modern&quot; game only shares the name of a once great MMO called World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

You only see some people ever log on just for the raid then you don't see them for another week. In my opinion that by itself shows the game has huge issues with ACTUAL content. Outside of raids and mythic+(which are a design that belong in diablo and not wow) there is nothing to do. We're still grinding wqs which we already did for 2 years in legion. It's old boring content. They could have *easily* cut the amount of wqs in HALF and doubled the rewards and that might have made it less tedious to do. I don't class them as &quot;content&quot; these days. They're boring. War fronts and island expeditions are both terrible.</div></div><hr />

You're not getting new talents, you're not getting new spells. Leveling from 110 to 120 in BFA may as well have just been two huge levels: 110 to 111, where 110 is &quot;not max level&quot; and 111 is &quot;max level&quot;. There's no other distinctions. Everything scales; the gear benchmarks are almost arbitrary because - again, everything scales.<br />
<br />
I want a system that has steady, assured gains in progression. My tolerance for pulling the slot machine levers has expired. It's an antiquated, crappy, lazy system. Create a currency (or just bring back the one you had), create a vendor, make the currency fall from every mode in the game, the end. Easy and everyone's happy.</div></div><hr />

that's why Blizzard does what it does, their solution will not fix anything<br />
<br />
do people are so blind or can't think for themselves that can't see that their solution we may still only see appear the Emissary Reward being a Armor Azerite 2-4 times at max a month and be totally random ?<br />
<br />
oh well in a month people will came back, for now blizzard will get his rest<br />
<br />
Dont be satisfied with so little people and they will continue to give less and less<br />
<br />
Read better people, Its not WQ rewards, Its Emissary reward. How much Emissary Rewards you saw having Azerite Armor since the launch ? Yes it was there if you can't remember or thinking that never was there<br />
<br />
also to confirm part of the response &quot;The plan is to make Azerite Armor rewards from Emissary quests scale all the way up to 370 (based on your item level)&quot; &lt; its not making Azerite Armor available on Emissary, its making Azerite Armor Rewards scale<br />
<br />
so tell me how much Azerite Armor you saw being on Emissary Reward? That will be your response for their solution. I only remember from launch 2 or 3<br />
<br />
dunno about you but on my lock and my dk, i get azerite chest prob 2-4 times a week during emisaries. its not bad for de and/or scrapping</div></div><hr />

So we’re actually looking at Emissary rewards for that. The plan is to make Azerite Armor rewards from Emissary quests scale all the way up to 370 (based on your item level), which gives everyone a new, reliable source for appropriate gear. Further on, we’re looking at making some further improvements to the ways Emissaries reward gear, but getting more Azerite Armor in your hands is the higher priority for the immediate future.<br />
<br />
So we basicly still wont be allowed to target the Azerite armor pieces we want to biuld those multiple sets of gear that was the whole idea behind this entire system in the first place. Instead we will still be forced to rely soley on bad RNG from the emissary chest to get the high end Azerite.<br />
<br />
Yea this is not convincing me to come back to the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaexion Ramza Beoulve</div><div class="date">2018-10-04, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's something I guess. I don't care about ilvl, and availability so much as I care about useless Abilities that don't reward gameplay.<br />
<br />
But by increasing availability you can have at least 1 ability you like most of the time.<br />
<br />
Let me give you a specific example, and explain why I stopped playing my demon hunter. I had never played Momentum build until I managed to get 3 pieces of azerite gear that all gave plus 1000 dmg to fel rush. Even though these pieces were 325 they gave 3000 damage to fel rush so I changed specs. It was fun to try this new build and do so much burst damage. it made questing fast and easy even when i change talents because momentum is dangerous in many dungeons(motherlode, etc.) the ability was still way more valuable than a temporary buff to haste or tiny heal when i didn't need it. What this essentially meant was that i had built a playstyle I loved, I accepted that the build doesn't work in every dungeon but it was fun. The traits were fun. Then the &quot;upgrades&quot; started coming in and they had no fel rush on them. Even though they boosted ym stats significantly it really didn't make up for the damage increase to fel rush. So when the traits are so important that lesser traits can't even compete what is the point. If a 350-360 cant compete with a 325 with fel rush what is the point?<br />
<br />
Not to beat a dead horse, but in legion your Artifact weapon had set traits and you collected relics that gave you a little bit extra to some of those traits. And although I found it hard to farm relics i could still pursue them. I had managed to collect 3 Eye Beam relics right before Antorus, it was awesome, it was fun. Now I understand what they were trying to do. For example let's say I could only choose half the Artifact talents in legion, If I had to choose between EyE Beam talent and Chaos Strike talent I would. It's a choice, it's player agency. And it was meaningful, if I chose Eye beam but i got relics that boosted Chaos strike that was ok too because I wasn't losing Eye Beam and chaos strike to a third lameduck talent that only gives 45 haste.<br />
<br />
Do you see the problem? Every other Azerite piece isn't making me choose one build over another, it's effectively eliminating two by either giving me 2/3 or 1/3 of what I want.<br />
<br />
Plus 1000 dmg to fel rush, great.<br />
Plus 500 dmg to Chaos strike, good.<br />
Plus 45 haste occasionally, immensely dissapointing.</div></div><hr />

I've been playing this game since vanilla. I'm 26 years old. I have the mentality of a cutting edge mythic raider since WotLK. I'm currently focusing on M+ where my survival is a non-issue and prioritizing damage. I'd be dropping a 340 piece with haste/mastery and my only item with Soaring Shield (which any prot paladin will tell you is insane for M+) + an additional trait + a 3rd trait in 1 azerite level from now for a 370 piece with my 2 worst secondary stats, an awful trait and no other traits for at least 15k more Azerite power which will take me weeks to obtain. Sims determine my gear choice and advocate not using a 30 ilvl upgrade. The &quot;20% upgrade on stats&quot; (it's really nowhere near this) is actually a downgrade in every aspect. Remind me again how my mentality is the problem here?</div></div><hr />

Yep so minimum 4 weeks to get 1/3rd of the way towards unlocking the 2nd trait on my shiny new 30 ilvl &quot;upgrade&quot;, by which point I'll have 4 traits on my 340 piece, provided I do all available world content. You see my point?<br />

I understand your point, but you're missing something, Azerite gear has no secondaries (it's actually a huge part of the problem with the gear...). You could be totally not wrong in your assessment, but secondaries play no role</div></div><hr />

You see my point?<br />
P.S. thanks for the delay 2 emissary tip!<br />
Have you factored in the 30% reduction in AP required per weekly reset?</div></div><hr />

They literally said that they'd put this in before 8.1.</div></div><hr />

I want class customization through my class, not random, untargetable gear.<br />
<br />
We will be dropping it, by the end of the expac we'll of healed Azeroth (or she dead as some believe) either way no more azerite leaking from the planet. We'll be on to the next threat and next theme. <br />
<br />
<br />
Even players who are doing a wide range of high-end content are still wearing at least one Item Level 340 piece<br />
<br />
^ This though, no fucking shit. Not a high end raider, but we do LFR, Normal and half of heroic every week, I'm still wearing one piece of 340 in my MS and two pieces in my OS. I've had one 355 from uldir drop and one 340 from LFR. <br />
<br />
I know LFR's only been out 4 weeks and theres only two bosses which drop a piece, but cmon on, 6-7 weeks of farming content, 15 ish bonus rolls on those bosses and nothing dropping. <br />
<br />
I know it would be a stat balancing nightmare but if they made azerite gear be able to TF - atleast the raid ones - then I believe it would help out a lot.<br />
<br />
Also I might be completely daft, but how does a new outer ring really solve anything?</div></div><hr />

I mean, I don't really mind that much but it seems to be a very stup... eh, interesting decision.</div></div><hr />

Maybe add different currency for different content, so they match the ilvl of the item. That would be simple and yet good fix imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
I Think our Azerite armor ilvl should match our ilvl of our heart of Azeroth</div></div><hr />
