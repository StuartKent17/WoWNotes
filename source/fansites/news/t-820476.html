We have a lot of players at 85 now doing everything from Heroic dungeons to rated Battlegrounds, and the class design team is starting to prepare our list of items to investigate for our next patch.<br />
<br />
Before you dive down into the meat below (not really a pleasant image, that), be advised that we’re still early in the preliminary stages. The patch isn’t coming out tomorrow. I wrote this before the end of the year and other things may have cropped up in the meantime. Just because your class or pet problem isn’t mentioned below doesn’t mean we won’t address it.<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
We’re happy with damage overall. We have very few traditional tank and spank fights (even Argaloth likes to parry melee) so it’s hard to get consistent numbers without very large data sets. Still, we see Survival hunters and Unholy DKs on top of a lot of single target fights. Arcane, Marksman, and Beastmaster damage is too low. Retribution, Shadow, and Fire and Frost mage damage might be too low, but we’re still watching them. We aren’t seeing a lot of Subtlety rogues in PvE yet, so that sample size is still small. On fights where there is a lot of area damage, Demonology warlocks, Frost DKs and possibly Survival hunters are all too high. Shadow priest AE, mostly due to a weak Mind Sear, feels too low.<br />
<br />
Healing in PvE is working out pretty much as intended. There are some Heroic dungeon bosses that are probably tougher than the required item level average permits. In general, you might have a tough time upon zoning into a Heroic dungeon with a bunch of strangers as soon as Dungeon Finder permits, especially if your group isn’t willing to communicate and work together. We want Heroics to be challenging -- if you want to zerg the content, stick to normal dungeons.<br />
<br />
Tank balance overall seems good at this point in time. Threat seems to be in a good place -- good tanks don’t have much of a problem, but they can’t “phone it in” either. We’re seeing all four tanks get a lot of use, even on Heroic raid fights. That could change as more guilds are able to make serious heroic attempts.<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
The larger health pools, decreased impact of Mortal Strike debuffs, and slower healing are all having the desired effect in PvP. Burst damage has its place, but doesn’t determine the outcome of every encounter. There are several individual abilities that we aren’t happy with in PvP.<br />
<br />
We’re keeping a close eye on dispels. We still like the design of making dispels more of a commitment rather than liberally sprinkling around dispel resistance or consequences for every class. Defensive dispels (removing a debuff) generally feel good, but we think offensive dispels (removing an enemy buff) feel too powerful, especially for DPS specs. In particular, Purge and Spellsteal will probably get nerfed.<br />
<br />
We’re also looking at crowd control, interrupts, and self-healing in PvP. It’s possible we’ll reduce the durations of some crowd control effects, especially the area effect ones, and decrease the duration of interrupts.<br />
<br />
Priests are a little weak in PvP, especially at mobile healing. We have made some changes to glyphs and talents to enhance their survivability and instant healing.<br />
<br />
We also want to make sure the epic PvP gear isn’t too easy for just anyone to obtain, given that the PvE endgame content is more challenging than it was in Lich King. We don’t want the player base to just migrate to the most efficient epic delivery mechanism; we want you to participate in what you find most enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Stats<br />
We’ll make a pass to make stats that aren’t attractive (but are supposed to be) more attractive. For example, we don’t want Assassination rogues to dismiss crit or Feral tanks to dismiss haste. We are considering making some physical attacks such as Lacerate, Steady Shot, and Slam scale with haste.<br />
<br />
Mastery is a new stat for us, and there are a few specs that don’t value it enough. In some cases (e.g. Combat rogues), the design for mastery is fine and we just need to buff the effects to make it more desirable. In others, we don’t think it’s possible to buff mastery enough in its current form. For example, the Retribution mastery, Hand of Light, is fun, but it doesn’t contribute enough damage. To make it contribute enough damage, the proc would need a very high chance, which then can cause paladins to devalue other sources of Holy Power. Instead, we are redesigning Retribution mastery to add a percentage of the damage of Templar’s Verdict, Crusader Strike, and Divine Storm as Holy damage (which also plays better with Inqusition). Because Hand of Light is fun, however, we are going to change Divine Purpose as a chance to proc Hand of Light instead of a chance for extra Holy Power (which will also remove a little of the randomness from the rotation). Unholy DKs are another spec for whom mastery just isn’t working out. Our current intent is to redesign their mastery so that their attacks cause more damage to diseased targets (in a similar manner to the Restoration druid mastery).<br />
<br />
Potpourri<br />
Some additional class-specific tweaks (keeping in mind this is not the full list):<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
We’re making some additional buffs, such as Pain Suppression and Barkskin, undispellable.<br />
We think we overnerfed Every Man for Himself, and are reverting it back to a 2-minute cooldown again. We might evaluate other racials after we’ve seen more PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
We want to make sure Unholy DKs prefer two-handed weapons.<br />
Necrotic Strike needs to be affected by resilience.<br />
For Cataclysm, we changed Death Strike almost completely into an ability for Blood DK tanks, which is a bit unfortunate. We want to make sure it is still a useful button for Frost or Unholy DKs who need healing.<br />
We also want to address DK mobility in PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..druid) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1117-Druid-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Even after we fixed their mastery, Feral druid bleeds still do a lot of damage and are undispellable. We plan to shift some of that damage back to main attacks. They are also a little too hard to control. Given that they are already hard to root, snare, or polymorph, we think the fear immunity from Berserk is too much.<br />
We’re buffing Wild Mushroom. It’s a cool spell that isn’t getting enough play.<br />
Empowered Touch will now benefit from Regrowth as well. We’re also buffing the Glyph of Regrowth.<br />
We are looking at Holy Concentration (after our most recent buff) and Omen of Clarity to make sure they don’t account for too much mana savings.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
As part of the Marks and Beastmaster buffs, we’re buffing Aimed Shot, Kill Shot, Chimera Shot, and Kill Command.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..mage) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1669-Mage-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
To reduce mage control, we are discussing reducing the duration of Frost Nova and Ring of Frost.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Censure will no longer break Repentance.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
For Holy priests, we’re increasing Chakra’s duration and changing Surge of Light so it can now from Flash Heal and Greater Heal and can crit.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..rogue) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1122-Rogue-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
We want to make it clear that Combat is intended to use fast off-hand weapons. We also want to polish Revealing Strike a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..shaman) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1124-Shaman-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
We want to make sure Enhancement shaman avoid caster weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warlock) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1125-Warlock-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
We are probably going to remove Drain Mana from warlocks. It is incredibly situational in PvE but causes problems in PvP. This might mean we need to evaluate Mana Burn as well.<br />
Inferno will no longer increase the radius of Hellfire.<br />
Shadow and Flame can now proc from Incinerate in addition to Shadow Bolt.<br />
We want to redesign Improved Soulfire.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warrior) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1676-Warrior-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Arms warrior burst damage might still be too high in PvP, while we don’t have a great way to adjust their sustained damage for PvE. The Lambs to the Slaughter talent is a good place to address this. We also might nerf warrior stuns.<br />
We think Arms and Fury warriors are getting too much damage out of Heroic Strike. We want it to be clear that it’s a rage dump and not make it the hardest hitting ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
“GC, is this the final list of changes? Does this mean I can expect no changes for my class? Does this mean you don’t care about me?”<br />
<br />
No. This is some stuff we are looking at so that you’ll have some context if you see changes on a future PTR. The final list of class patch notes for the next patch will doubtless be much longer.<br />

Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Dec. 27<br />
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br />
<br />
December 22 - 27<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
Graveyard Rats are no longer considered critters and do not give credit toward the Critter Kill Squad guild achievement.<br />
Weekly guild reputation caps should now properly reset at the scheduled time. An error which prevented this reset from taking place if guild experience was earned at exactly 3:00 AM server time immediately prior to weekly maintenance has been corrected.<br />
The achievement Saving for a Rainy Day has the same requirements as its predecessor Time to Open a Savings Account. For this reason Saving for a Rainy Day has been temporarily disabled (it will still show in the user interface), as it requires a fix via a client-side patch.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Archaeology<br />
<br />
Vashj'ir dig sites no longer unlock for players. They felt too punishing without additional benefits compared to low-level sites, and were much more difficult to obtain artifacts in due to the way Vashj'ir navigation works.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cooking<br />
<br />
Stormwind Lobster Traps now respawn more quickly and can be gathered across all Stormwind quest phases.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Twilight Highlands<br />
<br />
Crucible of Carnage quests can no longer be shared.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uldum<br />

The only other thing that would help is a slight mana cost reduction, but they don't really have to rework the spec, it'll just get more potent as time goes on.<br />
<br />
As much as that MAY be true, the fact that we aren't able to do anything in the current gear level means that a rework might work out better in the long run; every mage spec is based on crit alone, and that's so RNG, it's not even funny. We just can't get the crit required to do shit for DPS right now with the hit required, and yeah, you're right, it will get better in the long run, but so will everyone else; we'll still be lagging behind. <br />
<br />
Mastery is garbage for all 3 specs, and arcane can't even sustain it's only form of damage right now due to way too high of mana costs; by the time we get enough mana, everyone else will still be above us.<br />
<br />
They need to change everything. It's all too proc based and crit dependant, and its not working out right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
wtf is that nerf to mages ffs................. <br />
Well, you are getting buff's in PvE because your DPS isnt as high as it should be. Also, yes mages have too much control, specifically frost. The changes suggested (Remember, not final) fix that.</div></div><hr />

I fail to see where it says they'll be nerfing survival ? I only see them saying they'll buff MM and BM. Correct me if I'm wrong - please.<br />

“GC, is this the final list of changes? Does this mean I can expect no changes for my class? Does this mean you don’t care about me?”<br />

No. This is some stuff we are looking at so that you’ll have some context if you see changes on a future PTR. The final list of class patch notes for the next patch will doubtless be much longer.</div></div><hr />

I really don't think warriors will see a large drop in their damage, and how well they do. As they stated, they just want HS to be used as a rage dump. It'll be lower in damage, but it won't make warriors suck. Especially since they're doing extremely well right now. <br />

To reduce mage control, we are discussing reducing the duration of Frost Nova and Ring of Frost.<br />

Oh for the love of...<br />

Take Frost Nova and drop kick it's duration, but leave the two-minute CD Ring 'o Fun alone. Overall control nerfs need to hit mage's bread and butter control abilities if you want to see any kind of effect. Nerfing RoF is just stupid :(<br />

Why force UH DK's to use 2H? Frost feels horrid since these talents came in and now we're not going to be able to effectively DW as UH, this sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because Vykm, if you didn't realize that any non-frost DK is little more than a 2H-strike-monkey I'm afraid you've missed the point of the class entirely. If you want to DW like a pro and not roll frost you need to roll a rogue. DWing is what they do (or an enhancement shaman. They work too).</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty certain that's not how they intended you to read those sentences. If you look further down they are actually providing SV with a buff aswell in the form of Kill Shot - and the only thing they adress on the Hunter part of the notes is actually buffing MM and BM (most likely to make them on-par with SV.)</div></div><hr />

They've said it long ago that Frost is DW with the option of 2h and Unholy is 2h. That's their design and its been established for a long time.. so they're not forcing you to go 2h, just go frost if you really like DW, which.. frost DW is not weak if you're properly playing it.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what they have in mind, but I hope they're not taking the easy way out by nerfing Heroic Strike itself, instead of some of the talents for it. As a Prot Warrior, Heroic Strike is between 75-90% (yes, 90%) of my damage done on single target and that's including Shield Slam each CD and Devastate spam. This also means, that Heroic Strike highly contributes to my TPS. I've personally seen crits of ~15K Heroic Strikes as Protection and I'd prefer to keep them, since my crit chance is an alltime high of 1.5%..... (lol). For the record, my Shield Slam crits are also capped at 15K.....</div></div><hr />

As mentioned above our mastery sux, nobody wants it in pve, and morelikely in pvp, and still i find it in every piece of gear. our damage should be buffed, where eclipse should be nerfed, but at the end total damage would stay same or a little bit higher. sorry but its rly sad to see that starfire during eclpse hits same like other casters spells normally</div></div><hr />

I`ve tried both speccs and really, the only time I ever do any decent dps whatsoever is when I apply a perfect combustion, which can take ages to do as Hot Streak hardly proccs, a few times I actually had to just force it out and cast a Pyroblast myself....and then Combustion has a 3 min cd...that basically means I`m only doing respectable dps once every 3 mins, yay? <br />
<br />
Same goes for frost really, dps is reliant on Deep Freeze, I`ve not had much issues proccing any FoF so that`s all good, although Brain Freeze might want a buff to ensure more FFB uptime (if you`re glyphing for it, otherwise disregard this comment). <br />
<br />
Although the pinnacle of problems atm, mana. It takes hardly any time for me to get down to 10% within a fight, and having to use scorch to regen is very much painful to our dps while other classes go on with their business still using their best abilities.<br />
<br />
My suggestions would be either;<br />
<br />
1, Reduce CDs on Combustion and Deep Freeze. (This is the less likely choice as I'm sure they`ll be over the top powerful in pvp then.)<br />
2, Increase coefficients a bit more perhaps or the masteries.<br />
3, Reduce Mana costs considerably or buff Master of Elements or something...<br />
4, Buff Hot Streak (whichever as long as we get to see more proccs around, they're a rarity nowadays, seriously)<br />
or<br />
5, Improve Ignite and perhaps up the dot damage or even give a new a dot on say Fireball for example, would spice things up more.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my 2 coppers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do find it odd that shadow priests are mentioned as sub-par. The 3-4 spriests in my guild rival the hunters, rogues and me for top spots. Especially on multi-target fights spriests reign supreme due to their easy dotting.<br />
<br />
Oh and Demon locks are lower then the other lock specs, not to mention their slow spells makes them annoying in most fights where you need to run a lot. Having them be masters of AE really is their only perk (aside from the sp buff). If Bliz removes that demon locks will be a rare sight on raids.<br />
<br />
Oh ps. don't touch Improved Soul Fire. Keeping that 15% haste buff up is what makes good Destro locks stand out from the bad ones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2010-12-28, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok seriously, removing drain mana, seriously? the reason I go affil for PVP is to controll people especially healers and you NEED to drain mana to stand a chance, without that all I have are dots that every healer can dispel and a fear they can also dispel, what's the point in affil then? if you remove drain mana you NEED to remove mana burn it's equally fucked up.<br />
<br />
Drain mana is important not only to drain mana but it also scares a healer away, now they are just going to stand there dispelling everything I do then what? what a bullshit change.<br />
<br />
You do remember that dispelling everything all the time would be as effective as a mana drain right? It really does cost some good chunk of mana (and globals) to just sit there and dispel everything everywhere (and I guess they can't dispel fear on themselves).<br />
<br />
Good and necessary changes. There are still more to be addressed, but as they said, it's just the begining.<br />
<br />
Love that they're taking care of the new wave of &quot;stunlocks&quot;, fixing some abilities &quot;lack&quot; of DRs and decreasing the duration of AE CC's, it's obvious that a AE CC as effective as a single target one is too powerful with so minimal effort (taking into account that they're usually ranged).<br />
<br />
Warrior dmg isn't that &quot;awesomely&quot; high in pvp, but their ability to almost stunlock you + the dmg is crazy... put 2 warriors or more in a BG/Tol Barad scenario and that's really insane.<br />
<br />
Everyone could see the Feral nerf incoming... put a undispelable bleed, forget about him and move to the next target isn't &quot;skill&quot; (the same way stunlock isn't considered skill by Blizzard). The popular joke &quot;bleed, bear, win&quot; goes against their current philosophy, they want players to be more &quot;active&quot; in the damage they do. They did this with Ret Paladins seal/judgement/attacks in Wrath, but for another reason (to make hit cap more important than it was).<br />
<br />
The &quot;might&quot; about Ret paladins dmg is funny... lol</div></div><hr />

Should i remember once again that balance druids does not have a DEFENSIVE cd ?<br />
<br />
I'll repeat it once more:<br />
<br />
MUSHROOMS does not fit in the BALANCE tree, move them to the restoration tree and make them an healing spell:<br />
make detonate mushrooms leave on the ground the BED OF FLORA effect, because it's stupid to use one of our emergency DIRECT HEAL (swiftmend) to create a poor location controlled AoE HEAL<br />
Also make this ability our lvl83 new spell because no one cares about stampeding roar, because it's useless (1min cd, 10y range, 5sec speed boost, only 40% speed)<br />
<br />
Balance druids are pretty much dead if a melee reach them because druids can't escape from those classes that have at least 3 gap closers each one.<br />
So...give balance druid, something more fitting (you know we have typhoons, hurricanes, gale winds, cyclone etc) why don't give us as lvl85 ability a damned TORNADO ?<br />
<br />
If you don't know what I'm talking about, take a look at Howling Riftdweller in Hyjal<br />
You could give this spell a casting reticule and allow druids to use it as AoE damage, DEFENSIVE ABILITY vs melee (hide inside the tornado), AoE CC<br />
<br />
Every Class has at least a silence and a method to interrupt with a NOT SO LONG cooldown<br />
Why balance druids should rely on a ONE MINUTE cooldown ability while shamans can interrupt every 6 seconds and redirect a spell every 15sec ?<br />
The damned tornado with a reasonable cooldown would give balance an interrupt ability because it tosses the enemy in the air<br />
<br />
TORNADO: wowhead.com/spell=80066<br />

<br />
And what do they mean with &quot;We also want to address DK mobility in PvP.&quot; Is this a good thing or what..?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately that isn't intended... otherwise they would need to buff Frost 2H to match Unholy 2H.<br />
<br />
They stated that Frost IS the DW spec, you can't have a &quot;weird&quot;/not supported spec like DW Unholy as the best DW spec (or the best spec in hardmode gear as stated in EJ forums). You could have it the same way Frost does have 2H option (wich is good, since it spreads the use of 1hand weapons with strength), delivering a little bit less dmg, but suported and viable. Not the way it is today, a dedicated spec spending 4...5...6 talent points in DW loosing to one unintend spec that only spent half the points into it.<br />

Hope that DK mobility means they've noticed how easy is to kite them... especially non-unholy ones.</div></div><hr />

2 good points there.<br />
I am currently playing Spriest, single target DPS might be a little low as GC stated himself, aoe is terrible.. But hell, take a look at our MASTERY, its awfull.....

<br />
Hell no it isn't. DW Frost 83 last screenshot I had before 85 on the boss doing right at 10k dps. On trash itw as over 12 due to rime. You would find it amazing how few people bother to even read the tooltips for their class. DW UH is an abomination (see what I did there =P). I'm glad they are getting rid of it so I don't have to roll against damn UH dks on my 1h weapons. Only two specs on dk I will ever play are blood/frost. <br />

<br />
another thing is i dont see the problem with ret dps, or its mastery tbh, hand of light procs a lot and i pull quite a lot of dps tbh, with inquisition up and hand of light spam proccing with art of war, theres just so many choices of an attack, spam templar's verdict and exorcism, thats bout 15k-25k each crit i get per use of these attacks so i dont have a problem with their dps (or the heals i loves to heals on me pally) so if u think whatever u do with ret to up it up bliz im for it, more dps for me<br />

What about the current Skinning Problem? Tried gathering Leather lately? Its a pain in the Ass. Also the Grim Batol Dragons aint skinnable. Bosses only drop 1 Leather? comeon...<br />
<br />
Thats the Biggest Problems i see at the moment.<br />
<br />
I'm a skinner myself and yes Grim Batol mobs not being skinnable, is an issue but not a big one. However there is one place where you can farm leather from mobs just fine. ( Depending on your server being PVP or PVE, will make it easier/more difficult ) The place is tol barad, the actual PVP zone, the crocolisks that spawn right outside the raid there. PVP server, yep it is going to suck. PVE, wait 5 mins and then go back there, and you will not be flagged for PVP. Just an idea. And it is a good farm spot, I seem to get plenty of Bloated Stomachs ( With Volotiles in it )<br />
And in all honesty, that really is the ONLY place to farm leather. Hope that helped some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would love to see logs. If that is not available, their names, guild and server would be nice. However, without proof through logs, those numbers I am very skeptical of. <br />
<br />
It bothers me so very much when people have the audacity to tell others to learn their class and make huge claims without any sort of proof to back those claims. And then they don't even play that class or spec, they are just bashing other people for the sake of what exactly? Blizzard knows there are issues with Retribution, hence the incoming changes and the monitoring. <br />
<br />
Retribution is far too RNG based now. It is almost all RNG dependent, now actually. If you are able to just sit in one spot (not move at all), dps your heart out and get great procs, larger numbers are able to be acquired.... sometimes. But I sure as hell doubt any Ret is pushing out 20-30k right now. But please, correct me if I am wrong.</div></div><hr />

They need to make it holding 2/3 to win. Otherwise the defenders can just turtle at one base without fear of losing, they have no need to leave/attack.<br />
<br />
&quot;•We also want to address DK mobility in PvP.&quot;<br />
I hope that means we get more mobility, because I don't see how we could have too much. Only mobility-esque abilities we have are: Chains, Death Grip, Unholy Pres (Can easily be acquired via meta or boot enchant), or desecration/chillblains. Pretty much a snare, a &quot;charge&quot;, and a passive run speed. There are many classes that have that and more...<br />
<br />
As for the Death Strike buff, it was warranted. As Frost/Unholy Death Strike wouldn't be healing fast enough to out-do quest mob dmg...<br />
But I fear/feel that Blood self-healing will be nerfed for PvP, even though they say the tanks are where they want them. I was doing 3v3 with my cuz/lil bro, they died off the bat. And I went 1v3 and won 5 games in a row as blood, I was unstoppable.<br />
<br />
I just wonder when all this will happen. My lil bro is sad that hunters suck in PvP right now. I'm guessing around the end of Jan, if they do a PTR.</div></div><hr />

Crap. They're on to us! Howling Blast has ALWAYS been this good, just no one plays Frost as a DK, so no one's noticed. That and no ICC bosses had any AE damage to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, who cares? AE dmg is important on like 2 fights in all of the raids so far. Niche damage role is niche.<br />

Of course when it comes to PVP things are different. One class having the ability to output a great deal of damage against others is not balanced. So far I believe that almost all classes are balanced for PVP with some doing great burst damage, others are having very good cc ability, others have good dot damage and some healing tricks and others having great survivability. <br />
There are some small things that need to be nerfed or buffed so better balance can be achieved for PVP and I believe that in future patches all will be done correctly as it is supposed to be.<br />
Even when it is done that way, I am afraid that there will still be a lot of players that will complain that X class is overpowered and Y class is underpowered but this is a &quot;learn to play&quot; issue in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ring of Frost sucks ? Targetable Hungering Cold that procs every 3 seconds is OP , so how about u stop trolling ?<br />
<br />
To reduce mage control, we are discussing reducing the duration of Frost Nova and Ring of Frost.<br />
This should have been done back in beta when we( players) said it was overpowered but Blizzard apparently needed &quot;majority QQ&quot; to take action as always &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
Even after we fixed their mastery, Feral druid bleeds still do a lot of damage and are undispellable. We plan to shift some of that damage back to main attacks. They are also a little too hard to control. Given that they are already hard to root, snare, or polymorph, we think the fear immunity from Berserk is too much<br />
Yet again this stuff has been adressed in Beta and Blizzard ignored , funny thing how alot of players in beta said that they should shift some bleed damage into autoattacks/Fero bite/etc but Blizzard just dismissed it saying Ferals are fine , ALSO 20 sec FEAR IMMUNITY IS NOT BALANCED (caps for people with poor reading comprehension) This is yet again due to &quot;Majority QQ&quot;<br />
<br />
We are probably going to remove Drain Mana from warlocks. It is incredibly situational in PvE but causes problems in PvP. This might mean we need to evaluate Mana Burn as well.<br />
Inferno will no longer increase the radius of Hellfire.<br />
Shadow and Flame can now proc from Incinerate in addition to Shadow Bolt.<br />
We want to redesign Improved Soulfire.<br />
Remove Drain Mana from warlocks... nobody uses this in PvE and some warlocks use this to give them an chance to deal vs healers (this is like removing interrupts from Rogue,DK,Warrior etc , change is stupid and not needed , prob because people QQed over Mana Burn and Blizzard decided to remove this spell too ...)<br />
Inferno no longer increases the radius of Hellfire - This is PvP QQ right there , i can bet anything that Rogue QQ nerfed this talent (U could catch ROGUES with it if they PLAYED STUPID) <br />
Shadow and Flame can now proc from Incinerate - In beta this was suggested , BLizzard dismissed this idea ...<br />
Redesign Improved Soulfire - no real comment about this now until we see more info but i am skeptical about this &quot;redesign&quot;</div></div><hr />

I too hate PvP nerfs that screw with PvE...but, they made the feral rotation MUCH easier now and a good vs bad feral is more about gear/gemming/laziness than skill now.

&quot;PvE<br />
On fights where there is a lot of area damage, Demonology warlocks, Frost DKs and possibly Survival hunters are all too high&quot;<br />
<br />
Unholy DK Halfus - http://worldoflogs.com/rankings/players/Bastion_of_Twilight/Halfus_Wyrmbreaker/25N/Unholy_Death_Knight/<br />
Frost DK Halfus - http://worldoflogs.com/rankings/players/Bastion_of_Twilight/Halfus_Wyrmbreaker/25N/Frost_Death_Knight/<br />

There is a 9K dps difference between the top UH DK (72,341 dps) and the top Frost DK (63,901). And you still believe that Frost death knights are higher in the AOE range?<br />

Now Marksman is presently the Dance Dance Revolution specialization. You have to press the right sequence of buttons, in the time, following the rhythm, and any delay or wrong button decreases your score, and you start slow at every pull, gaining speed at middle of fights. <br />
<br />
Improved Steady Shot mechanics, Aimed Shot horrible procs, Marked for Death nerf, Mastery based on attack speed on a slow shotting spec.... MM is just SAD.<br />
<br />
All the low damage they are seeing is based on how demanding they did MM to link a whole chain of skills to be able to damage, and then made it nearly impossible to be done as intended. Improve the numbers will NOT fix it, since the skills will still be faulty.</div></div><hr />

The very first version of Chakra had a 1 min cool down for a 30 second buff, thus to keep chakra up constantly you needed to make use of State of Mind. But a little while ago the cool down on Chakra was set to 30 sec, the same as the base duration of the buff, and since Chakra has no mana cost and doesn't have trigger global cool down there isn't really any reason to want to extend the buff at all at the moment. The only thing you are saving yourself is having to hit a button a little less frequently, which isn't much of a savings since there is a ui display when the buff expires, the State of Mind talent is pretty much useless. If they now want to make the chakra buff even longer by default State of Mind becomes even less useful. It would be nice if this talent were updated to have additional effect or have its effect changed so that it gives a stacking mana cost reduction for the spells associated with your current chakra buff, or a stacking effect increase for your spells associated with your chakra buff. But I guess I now get some talent points freed up from State of Mind that can be put towards other useful effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unholy DKs doing a bit too much, I suppose I can see this. I ALWAYS stomp every single person in my random dungeons, but I just assumed that was because they're retarded (and they usually are). Mastery is bad for Unholy right now, so if they toned down damage a bit and changed mastery how they said they would, then they should scale much better from gear (mastery being almost useless), and be in a similar spot. I don't really have a problem with DW Unholy, but it's now how Blizzard wants you to play, so I can understand doing something about this. I say move endless winter or something else useful to all specs to tier 1 frost, and move nerves of cold steel down the tree a bit.<br />
Frost AOE is a bit too high? Well what do you think when you gave them the best aoe in the world? Herp derp. 2H Frost needs something (either attacks scale better with a 2H or buff to might of the frozen wastes) because it's really far behind the other specs. Saying Unholy is way above DW Frost isn't right at all, so I don't see where Unholy really beats it out.</div></div><hr />

Feral bleeds are stupid good right now in PVP, and waiting 20 secs to fear bomb, while I'm getting Rip-rolled, means I'm clicking &quot;Release Spirit&quot; every time. Removing the fear immunity is a welcome change, imo. Besides, they didn't say they were nerfing damage, they just said they &quot;plan to shift some of that (bleed) damage back to main attacks.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
No one said you had snare immunity. In fact, maybe you're on to something, it would be much easier if they would just give all classes a snare removal that costs 5-8% of base mana, is instant cast, and has no cooldown.<br />

<br />
LOTRO is free already and has been for some time. It is not however a good game IMO. Seems very stiff. I also think the graphics are awful, but that's me.<br />
<br />
Rift: Planes of Telara should be coming out in March or April from what I'm hearing and the videos look great. Interesting class system and a very WoW inspired UI and character control from what Beta users have said. Graphics look beautiful and allegedly it's nicely balanced, though we'll have to see. I'll certainly give it a try, and while I'll never be one to claim a game will make me quit WoW, I'm actually attracted to the idea of a fresh start and freeing myself from Blizzard. I went into the Cataclysm with an open mind and was excited for it, but I'm not that into it so far. The idea that they are making the game harder than it has been in a long time (which is a good thing) but dumbing down the overall experience prior to endgame (ie: tooltips, lack of need for grouping, all quests in dungeons, reducing once elite mobs to normals, etc) seems counter productive. Even if the game isn't perfect, I like consistency. I'd be perfectly willing to live with the game still being easier like WotLK if it were to stay consistent. WoW is constantly making huge alterations to it's mechanics and overall vibe, and it's getting old. I'm looking forward to trying something new.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Discuss<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Halfus has one small AE section, which isn't even guaranteed to be there each week :P Most of the fight is on single target, so the DPS will be higher in the long run for Unholy.<br />
<br />
Magmaw is an obvious choice to look at to make a case for Frost AE dmg as a counterpoint, but there's an asterisks in that Unholy can't really get in to spread diseases as easily as Frost can with HB. Still, there are some parses in the top logs that feature Unholy, and they're still competitive at least. <br />
<br />
I still am of the belief that Howling Blast is the best AE move in the game right now, since it doesn't have any cap on damage, aside from pulling threat and getting punched in the face ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've been monkeying with classes as far as I can remember. Starting with WotLK they seemed to up the frequency of nerfing, buffing, and adjusting abilities, though. Still, I don't see them doing anything differently today than with TBC other than being more aggressive.<br />
<br />
Every expansion I can safely say that my playstyle, spec, rotation/priorities have greatly changed from release to the final patch. One ability gets a pan to the face, so we work around it and use a different ability. Nothing is ever static with Blizzard and WoW.<br />

Has a Blue ever come out and said anything about people's suggestions that if the attacker has 2/3 bases then they should win?

DK's do too much dmg especially with many adds (howling blast) that you don't notice it in a 5 man group is pretty logical.<br />
Because there aren't that many adds, mostly do CC now etc, you should see what a frost dk could pull off if you let him dps a whole pack! And many aren't that good geared yet ( hence being in an hc )<br />
And about mages, they are godly in pvp, that is true but they aren't in pve raid battles. So why are mages so good in pvp? Mostly because of their control. What is blizzard doing ? Indeed nerfing their controlling abilities. So they compesate eachother more then enough to not cause trouble being weak or op in either game pve or pvp. Atleast that is what blizzard is trying to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all: PvP =/= PvE<br />
<br />
I do agree that frost mages are OP in PvP right now, but fire and frost mages are not that well in PvE beacause we are too reliant on RNG, you may have seen a mage toping the dps in 1 or 2 fights when he got lucky.<br />
<br />
There are ways to buff frost mage PvE damage without afecting PvP at all, like buffing Deep Freeze damage which only affects raid bosses. So stop giving your opinion when you are clueless about other's classes mechanics</div></div><hr />

2/3 is just throw the problem to the other extreme. But considering how Blizzard developers keep showing that &quot;middle term&quot; isn't a concept they are familiar with, probably can happen.<br />
<br />
What bothers me since I read about Beta's Tol Barad is that the vehicles and towers are absolutely stupid. They should make other things than auto-attack towers, and towers just add time... Every single vehicle and tower should have one special effect, with the possibility of 3 towers down meaning the 2/3 to conquer.<br />

Have you seen the Frost tree? The DW spec is at the 1st tier while the 2H spec is almost at the bottom. I must say the 1st tier of Frost is rather horrible, it's either DW or something utterly useless PvP-utility placeholders you take just to get further down on the tree.<br />

Drain mana is important not only to drain mana but it also scares a healer away, now they are just going to stand there dispelling everything I do then what? what a bullshit change.<br />

<br />
Generally when people say &quot;dps&quot; they are refering to PvE. Currently, survival hunters are raping dps meters in every type of fight in PvE, and mages are falling behind mostly due to their class working around rng talents and being very crit dependant.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neurus</div><div class="date">2010-12-29, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">- yes please :) <br />

<br />
I agree with that, Mages do have a lot of control, but these days, where every healer can dispel magic, sheep being very easy to break with a lot of AoE “unintended” damage, and most classes having either a couple of ways to interrupt you or close the gap, Frost Mages have a hard time surviving any tunneled vision class (warrior/ferals/even rogues). <br />
<br />
This is not about 1v1 (Where a decent mage can probably annoy a rogue -and maybe a bad warrior). 1v1 is not important, even 2v2 is less, but still shows that if a warrior/healer wants to kill a mage, now he has the tools (stuns) to do it. <br />
<br />
In the course of the first 20-25 seconds (to say a number) a mage can try to stop an attacker (warrior, DK, rogue, Feral for example) by using (in no particular order) :<br />
<br />
Frost Nova,Pet Nova, Blink, Cone Of Cold (4sec frozen targets if talented), One Free frost nova from the Ice Armor breaking (they are hitting him anyway), The new AoE (RoF), ultimately IceBlock and Mirror Image.<br />
<br />
The problem with that in practice is that a competent dispeller will negate 5 of those (the Frost stuff including RoF, all negated by a single Freedom from a Paladin). Mirror images are raped by AoE (Bladestorm for example). Ferals are very hard if not impossible to properly root with Nova for more than 1 GCD. Warriors being dispelled are unstoppable (ask a shadow priest, LOL). Rogues? They need a dispeller (mutt especially) but they do so much dmg these days that unless your partner is really damaging “their” healer, a rogue will rape you.<br />
<br />
Now you could argue that a good mage won’t be “caught” in the trap and will be able to sheep the dispeller or silence him, and that he/she will have one or more partners putting enough pressure somewhere else (or peeling), but in practice balance doesn’t always come from “the perfect scenario” the perceived balance the game has, must come from things people do, not spreadsheets only. <br />
<br />
I believe good mages are OK, normal and bad ones will have more trouble because they will not know how/when to use their CDs properly to counteract for other players’ actions. <br />
<br />
I’ve been doing some 2v2 Mage/Feral and some teams are easy to beat, but as resilience goes up and rating grows, it’s harder to land a kill, *even* with a couple of sheeps, counterspell, Deep Freeze and clones. <br />
<br />
Mana pools that are supposed to go down faster (and they do) don’t go down fast enough, and there isn’t more “I global you” thing going on. So I believe that double-dps teams are going to be less frequent than ever, as only extremely experienced and geared people will be able to handle that. Think that as gear increases, so does damage *and* mana/healing pools. <br />
<br />
The hotfixes changes seen so far, all point to a balance in that, less “control”, shorter CC durations and more *controlled* pew pew.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Magmaw is an obvious choice to look at to make a case for Frost AE dmg as a counterpoint, but there's an asterisks in that Unholy can't really get in to spread diseases as easily as Frost can with HB. Still, there are some parses in the top logs that feature Unholy, and they're still competitive at least. <br />
<br />
I still am of the belief that Howling Blast is the best AE move in the game right now, since it doesn't have any cap on damage, aside from pulling threat and getting punched in the face ;)<br />
<br />
Actually, in the heroic version of HW the AOE is not a small section of the encounter. Review the logs. On every fight Unholy is ahead. Magmaw is a horrible choice to look at for Frost AOE damage as many guilds, such as mine, are having the hunters aoe the adds.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully it's only for Enhancement and Elemental. If not, there's really no reason to bring one over a Holy Paladin. All other benefits of a shaman are already covered by infinitely better classes.<br />
<br />
You mean they just realized that Spellsteal and Purge were too powerful? It was immediately obvious to anyone that was playing once 4.0.1 went live. Playing my mage at the time, against any class that could dispel it meant I had no buffs at any time, period. By the same token, playing against anyone that had buffs meant that they belonged to me no problem.<br />
<br />
EMFH buffed again, does this mean you can use two overpowered PVE trinkets in PVP again?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rennadrel</div><div class="date">2011-01-01, 04:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am curious as to know what they plan on doing with Howling Blast for Frost Death Knights. Yes, it's quite possibly the most overpowered DPS ability in the game right now and one reason would be that it can hit an unlimited number of targets. I think the damage on it is fine, mine hits for like 6k per target which is reasonable for an AoE and far better then the terrible AoE that Retribution Paladins have (Divine Storm and Holy Wrath are terrible for damage).<br />
<br />
I think they need to just set a limit on how many targets Howling Blast can hit, ideally 8 would be the maximum number of targets since it does use a Frost Rune. Of course they could also take it off the Frost Rune use and make it use Runic Power (ideally 10) and hit a maximum of 5 targets at the same damage level it currently does. Also doing so could give you the option of a free choice of Frost Strike or Howling Blast that doesn't use Runic Power which would be awesome. I think as a whole, DK's have a pretty good AoE setup as it is if you are Frost at least, Howling Blast is overpowered but we can't use Death and Decay in dungeons because it is a high threat generator and breaks CC so ideally it can only be used on single target bosses in Unholy spec. So it's basically Pestilence and Blood Boil which aren't great for damage, but Pestilence helps spread diseases on multiple targets which is handy when you don't need to CC or have mobs out of the range of Pestilence.<br />

<br />
I did 24k on Halfus in all heroic blues as Frost Dual Wield (aside from Soul Blade in my main hand) and I only used Howling Blast 5 times to help kill the whelps. I still pulled 6.8 million damage on the boss directly, so yeah Frost is just fine if you are dual wielding, and Unholy AoE is pretty bad in my opinion. Diseases may hit for a lot of damage, but when Howling Blast crits for 15k on like 10 targets, there is no way Unholy's diseases hitting that many targets could come close to the same kind of damage. And from what I have seen, you need to use a 2 hand weapon as Unholy to put up the same kind of numbers that I can do as Frost DW, since the other DK in my guild is Unholy 2H spec, I am Frost DW.<br />

Try playing a DW Frost DK. Get an Obliterate crit proc right off a trash pull and even if your tank has threat on one target, you will instantly pull aggro.</div></div><hr />

Ok, I myself play a rogue. We are pretty much balanced atm.<br />
But I am sick of hearing all this whining against frost mages in PvP.<br />
Ok ice lance is an instant cast that can crit for about 18-20k ish with some resi IF the mage has a FoF proc.<br />
Removing deep freeze - yeah right, it is the only stun in frost spec that is viable and they can use it like what, each 30 seconds?<br />
I mean what have players to complain about, each good player who knows to play there class has a fair chance vs a mage.<br />
Ok they can freeze and kite us around, but we got counter abilities to use then...so many classes can dispell all the frost, U-Dk's are immune to magic attacks 24/7 with there bubble thing, us rogues can use glyph of garotte (5second silence) and have 5seconds time to burn the mage time, not even going to talk about ferals here.<br />
Warriors, lol they can charge 2times in like 2secs then have 30sec cooldown and can go 2secs again and all that to hit us with an 35k heroic strike next lol.<br />
The only thing that imo should get nerfed bout pvp frost mages is ring of frost maybe, its to hard in BG's.<br />
All the rest who is complaining frost mages are to hard and can't win from them obviously (no offence) does not know how to handle them in PvP.<br />
Period.<br />

well thats the stupidest thing I've heard in awhile, Survival hunters arn't that OP. Hunters in general seem neglected in the &quot;buff department&quot; of blizzard its about time they actually have a chance to have decent damage, Ret paladins were OP for almost a year but they didn't jump on nerfing them the same way they seem to feel hunters &quot;need&quot; nerfing. There are several other classes that need nerfing before hunters ie. rogue PVP, and anything mage<br />

hope your joking...? Is that where you compare dps? on trash mobs in a particular situation that rarely ever presents itself in such a way? In your signature it seems you're a hunter so I hope i'm right about joking, even if you aren't, limit multishot to ~10 targets and that's all solved and there is no need to nerf a class that finally does well in its only possible niche after years of being ignored (aside for that possible week when volley made hunters strong)</div></div><hr />
