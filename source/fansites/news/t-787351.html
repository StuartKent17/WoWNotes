<br />
Subduing the Elements<br />
<br />
The player receives Earthen Ring Supplies (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52274/earthen-ring-supplies/) when the quest starts. It contains Cleansing Totem (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52272/cleansing-totem/) and Elemental Sapta (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/27317/elemental-sapta/).<br />
Drinking Elemental Sapta (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/27317/elemental-sapta/) allows you to see the elemental spawned around the zone. <br />
Use Cleansing Totem (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52272/cleansing-totem/) and target the elementals to destroy 20 of them. <br />

Tablets of Earth/Fire<br />
<br />
Go to the quest location on your map, you will see the Courier and a Mysterious Crystal. You have to click the Mysterious Crystal to defend the courier against the Twilight Seeker.<br />
3 New abilities will appear in your action bar, use them to defeat the elementals spawning from the portals. <br />
When the Twilight Seeker flies away, just loot the tablets on the ground and bring them back.<br />

The actual invasion is a pretty cool event. I imagine it could possibly last 2 weeks (with all the gear and bosses and city wide events to participate in.)<br />

As for this &quot;phase,&quot; it seems a little lacking in content. WTB longer quest line.</div></div><hr />

We could have part 2637 in 6 years time ? Two pointless quests that have very little to do with anything related to whatever is supposed to be happening (my avatar does not live on earth or go to BLizzcon). Im almost as dissapointed as he is atm. But hey... I know what the hell is going on and these two quests are just crap as part of some worldchanging events. <br />

Complaining that there's almost nothing new to do this week. Pining for the (admittedly awesome) zombie event. That's just pathetic. Do you really think there was more things to do during the second week of the zombie invasion than there is for this event? The zombie disease just became very slightly harder to cure. Big whoop. The real fun didn't start until the last week, when you could actually form roving bands of zombies that could ravage entire capital cities.<br />

Well people complained about the Zombie Invasion and they took that away, so because of how people whined about the Zombie Invasion they made this Pre-Event even duller thanks to those crybabies. Just watch, when Phase 3 and 4 come around and people are dieing because of 700k Lv 80 Elite Elementals killing everyone, people are going to AGAIN whine about it and come the next expansion the Pre-Event will be Phase 1 and 2 of this phase and that'll be it.<br />

If they could have done the Zombie event without giving people the ability to grief other players then it would've been great. They didn't, so it was a massive pain in the ass when I was trying to get stuff done. The Elemental Invasion is currently at the other end of the spectrum: lots of small things that are barely worth paying attention to. Hopefully Blizzard will get it right with the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Those elite elementals already were a joke on PTR. I think I would have been able to solo one of them at a time because just with a handful of people it was already a complete snoozefest. <br />

I agree with you, fully. What caused it was the sheer amount of crybabies who wouldn't stop acting &quot;serious gamer&quot; and have some damn fun, turning into zombies and trying to kill zombies in the last event. Well this is what we get when people bitch to that extent, a snooze fest, I'd rather have the newer Elemental models attack the cities, make them powerful so you do in fact need three or four players to take just one down. I want some damn Elementals tearing up shit, I couldn't even finish the one quest where you have to... capture 20 not aggressive, not neutral but FRIENDLY Fire Elementals. Come the fuck on, this is just sad. I blame the carebears who couldn't enjoy some good old World Events.<br />
<br />
I'd also like for pieces of buildings to fall onto unsuspecting players and kill them instantly if they're not around 78+ in level when we get Earthquakes. Deathwing is raping Azeroths core and we have to capture 20 FRIENDLY FIRE ELEMENTALS? Come on!</div></div><hr />

It's funny, so few people defended Blizzard when people nerd raged for weeks on the offical forums or gave very much praise. They consider the event a failure due to so much negative feed back. Now people are bitching and whining its easy mode and not at all epic. They aren't mind readers, they are trying to cater to those who yelled the loudest back during the scourge attack. It's your own damn fault for not speaking up and telling them how awesome you thought it was.<br />
<br />
Maybe if the community wasn't composed of whiney dipshits who don't post constructive critisism or praise things would be different, you frankly did it to yourself. It really is lose lose for them, they just can't make anyone happy.<br />

They consider the event a failure due to so much negative feed back. Now people are bitching and whining its easy mode and not at all epic. They aren't mind readers, they are trying to cater to those who yelled the loudest back during the scourge attack. It's your own damn fault for not speaking up and telling them how awesome you thought it was.<br />
<br />
Maybe if the community wasn't composed of whiney dipshits who don't post constructive critisism or praise things would be different, you frankly did it to yourself. It really is lose lose for them, they just can't make anyone happy.<br />
<br />
People are ALREADY complaining about Deathwing attacking zones for god sakes.<br />
<br />
Yes, poor poor blizz. They just can't ignore the complaints of the whiners and have to do their bidding. If you go back to the forums there WERE many many people who praised the zombie invasion as a stroke of genius and were frothing at the mouth when they obviously cut it short. Imagine if at the end of the thing you felt like you were in a true zombie apocalypse, with small bands of &quot;survivors&quot; trying to avoid massive mobs of ghouls. I think thats what they were going for, and it would have been amazing. <br />
<br />
The truth is they've been hyping cataclyms as the end of the world for over a year now. In blizz's own words we are supposed to be, &quot;...heroes who will rise up to protect their scarred and broken world from utter devastation.&quot; THEY are the ones that built up the excitement for something huge, so don't be surprised when people expect some huge, chaotic, world shattering pre-event craziness. I love the game, but come on, even the most hardcore fanboys I know are asking the proverbial, &quot;WTF?&quot;</div></div><hr />

I hope he scorches the living crap out of every square inch of the game. Everything should burn, screams should be heard, ashes and fire should rain from the sky. Any people whining about not being able to see the quest givers for their brand new lvl 1 &quot;whatever.&quot; working on achievements, or world-of-auctioncrafting should be made into bone necklaces for doomsday cultist. This is supposed to be the freaking apocalypse, not picking daisies with deathwing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't much of an event, IMO. Even having tried the actual city invasion stuff out on the PTR it doesn't seem engaging. Kill elementals, queue for bosses that you've killed a million times. I hope there's more to it than what I saw.</div></div><hr />

I never said anything about the quality of the events. I was more commenting on the fact that the event only came with 2 quest this Monday. Why is everyone so quick to attack on forums? You don't get any internet points for it.</div></div><hr />

I can confirm that there is something new with the elemental spawns. The air elementals were spawning tornados that deal 200 dmg a tick (about 3 sec ticks).<br />

The flame wave isnt new, they were doing it last week<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shambulanced</div><div class="date">2010-11-09, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple specific complaints:<br />
1) The rifts despawning after a set amount of time (was 10 minutes, last week) is pretty weak. If anything, rifts should grow with time, and spawn stronger and stronger elementals.<br />
2) This &quot;phase&quot; of the invasion is, as many have noted, pretty lackluster. One quest is completable without doing the event yourself (which is actually a good thing, judging from how many people were standing around waiting for the tablet to spawn). Would have been better as a mini-phased quest target. The other quest is dull...the elementals don't even attack you. <br />
<br />
Comments:<br />
1) Finding rifts while farming is pretty neat, although their locations (given that there won't be elementals spawning at those spots during Cata) is very arbitrary.<br />
2) When the actual invasion of capitals hits, it is pretty fun. A lot like the Lich King's attack on Orgrimmar.<br />
3) The doomsday cultists/stuff (for anybody who bothers READING THE QUEST TEXT/npc chatter) is actually pretty hilarious. Double edged sword, though, as the humor takes away from the gravity of the situation.</div></div><hr />

Twilight's Cult (Part II): <br />
After having prevented their assault on Orgrimmar and Stormwind, Garrosh and Varian have decided to take the fight to the enemy. It will be up to you to capture some cultists, learn their rituals, and ultimately disrupt them. Finally you will make an important trip to meet someone in Nagrand and learn further about the elemental invasion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Phase 4: <br />
Elemental Invasion (Part II):<br />
The denizens of the Elemental Plane have finally mustered enough strength and courage to attack your capital cities. The Horde will have to defend Orgrimmar and Thunder Bluff, while the Alliance will need to take care of Ironforge and Stormwind. Every 2-3 hours NPCs in those cities will yell out, informing all players that an invasion is about to begin. This warning will start a 5-minute window, during which players will have to haul sandbags or barricades to locations indicated by red markers. Low-level players will be instructed to take one of the portals in the cities and escape to safety. After all the barricades have been placed, or after 5 minutes have expired (whichever one happens first), the elementals will being their attack.<br />
<br />
Before you even being battling the invaders, talk to one of the Earthen Ring Defenders located throughout the cities, and get your Earthen Ring Unbinding Totem - you will need it. The objectives of the event are straight-forward:<br />
<br />
*Free all citizens. At the beginning of the invasion, the elementals will trap a number of citizens in every district of the cities. You need to find them and use your Totem to free them. Your UI will indicate how many citizens remain trapped in each district.<br />
<br />
*Defeat all elementals. Every rift will spawn exactly 32 elementals. YouR UI will show you how many rifts remain standing in each district. Make a good use of your Totem if a fellow player gets imprisoned.<br />
<br />
*Beat the clock. You have one hour to complete all this.<br />
<br />
If you succeed at closing at least one of the rifts, all players who participated in the defense will gain a buff appropriate to the type of elementals you just repelled. Also, every city will be attacked only by two types of elementals.<br />
<br />
Earth: Attacks Ironforge &amp; Orgrimmar.<br />
Fire: Attacks Ironforge &amp; Orgrimmar.<br />
Water: Attacks Stormwind &amp; Thunder Bluff.<br />
Wind: Attacks Stormwind &amp; Thunder Bluff.<br />
<br />
And finally, successfully defending a city will allow you to take the fight to the enemy! A rift will open from the city you just defended to the hideout of a minor elemental lord. You will be able to queue for them through the Dungeon Finder just like you queue for seasonal bosses. All of the elemental bosses drop items of level 251, equivalent to ICC10 loot.</div></div><hr />

I'm looking forward to the bosses, and other fun stuff soon. Also to anyone who is wondering about the Shattering, Blizzard has said that the next content update will occur (I think it is 4.0.3) and &quot;some time&quot; after, probably about a week, the Shattering will occur. I'm thinking the Shattering will take place on about December 1, so that it is close enough to Cata that it will still be &quot;New&quot; when Cata comes out, but so that they can also make sure the servers are working with new everything. <br />
<br />
Looks like it could go as follows:<br />
-&gt; November 2: Phase 1<br />
-&gt; November 9: Phase 2<br />
-&gt; November 16: Phase 3<br />
-&gt; November 23: Phase 4<br />
-&gt; December 1: Shattering<br />
<br />
I just don't know if they would really follow such a predictable schedule like that, and I think they may want Phase 4 and the bosses to be available for more than just 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I figured that was the real reason behind it, thanks for confirming.<br />
<br />
I also can confirm that the spawning rifts throughout Azeroth now have a shorter respawn timer, making it more likely that you find another rift while the first buff is still ticking.<br />
The respawn reduction appears to be 10 minutes, so now it's 40 mins and 10 mins uptime instead of 50 mins and 10 mins uptime. Happy hunting! ;)</div></div><hr />

And finally, successfully defending a city will allow you to take the fight to the enemy! A rift will open from the city you just defended to the hideout of a minor elemental lord. You will be able to queue for them through the Dungeon Finder just like you queue for seasonal bosses. All of the elemental bosses drop items of level 251, equivalent to ICC10 loot.<br />
<br />
Yay, we get to battle a MINOR elemental lord through DUNGEON QUE. Where are our epic world boss fights they wanted to bring back? give us a friggin huge fire elemental in the middle of Ironforge, a water elemental wreaking havok upon Stormwind from the harbor, give us a huge earth elemental tearing up Orgrimmar, and blazing typhoons and wind elementals knocking you off Thunder Bluff if you don't watch your ass. They gave you a portal out. There are two citys being totally safe. IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR SOME HUGE THREATENING SOMETHING? In PTR, i couldn't see why i should take the portal out. I could just walk through Ironforge without anything threatening me in any ways, except for the big scary portals to safety i might accidentally click. Disappointed me is disappointed:(.</div></div><hr />
