You can skip using it but would have to go through certain procedures. I forget the details but it's mentioned on the reddit thread IIRC.</div></div><hr />

thats the first i've heard of it considering the policy blizzard gives is that no form of ticket will be accepted beyond the use of the app. so either someone on reddit is lying or this news isn't spreading.<br />
<br />

<br />
That's a little disingenuous. AXS will sell your personal info (because their app is the one you have to install) but Blizzard has no involvement in this process besides choosing to work with AXS and they don't benefit from it in any way.</div></div><hr />

granted i don't use reddit so i don't entirely understand the layout. so ya, it was probably a bad search. however, neither of your sources say you can attend without using the app. your first source only says &quot;If for some reason you find yourself at the show with a dead mobile device or some other unexpected issue preventing you from accessing the app, don’t worry. Just head to the Solutions Desk at registration and they’ll help you out&quot;. that could simply be phone chargers and some technicians to help with errors. you can't claim there is a method to avoid using the app where no method is specified.<br />
<br />
your second source has written &quot;To pick up your badge at registration this year, you’ll need to download the AXS Mobile App. The app displays a QR code (one code for all of your tickets), which changes at regular intervals to help guard against dupes and fraud. Because of that, we won’t be able to accept paper tickets, confirmation emails, or screenshots/photos of the QR code at BlizzCon registration&quot;. so no, you can not get into blizzcon, even if you purchased tickets, without using the app.</div></div><hr />

They are not, you just have to spam click &quot;Find Tickets&quot;, even if it gives the &quot;Oh no&quot; message.<br />
I think i will pass for this year (now that i finally have the means to afford it i don't want to go...).</div></div><hr />

Stop grasping at straws and assuming things you don't know, just to try to be right, SMH. You show up after buying a ticket, probably with your receipt, and everything will be alright. Also:<br />
<br />
1. &quot;If for some reason you find yourself at the show with a dead mobile device&quot; - You can even straight up lie saying your phone is dead/lost/whatever you can think of and they'll help you solve your problem. It's literally called the &quot;Solutions Desk&quot;.<br />
2. &quot;If for some reason you find yourself at the show [...] or some other unexpected issue preventing you from accessing the app&quot; - Some other unexpected issue literally means any issue whatsoever.<br />

To be honest, even if EA somehow decided to do an &quot;EA-con&quot; I'm pretty sure tickets would still sell out. They're just juggernauts of the industry at this point.</div></div><hr />

apparently being skeptical of vague, undefined systems is grasping at straws. should i point out the advice given is if you have a DEAD phone? if you show up with no phone and a receipt, you're going to get the &quot;we won’t be able to accept paper tickets, confirmation emails, or screenshots/photos of the QR code at BlizzCon registration&quot; talk. <br />
<br />
I have read the policy, it's vague and doesn't get into detail beyond what they will accept as proof of purchase. but hey, if you think vague policy equates to crystal clear exceptions, then i can't change your point of view as you don't understand what you are talking about. you need to learn what business and legal speech is and how to act around it.<br />
<br />
edit: the &quot;go to the help desk&quot; line is in both sources, doesn't specify what or how the help desk will help and says just go there. that is vague as heck and doesn't say anything about an alternative to getting in without using the app.<br />
<br />
edit 2: i will admit, i'm assuming a bit. but, you are too. you are assuming blizz will have ways of getting you in without the app. here is the big difference. my assumption is that blizz is going to stick to their policy and have no details about how you might get around using the app. your assumption is that blizz has everything figured out and that the policy given is actually what they meant to say.<br />
<br />
my assumption is healthy skepticism.<br />
<br />
your assumption is blind faith.</div></div><hr />

Should I point out that the advice given is if you have a dead phone AND any other unexpected issues, a statement which literally includes any issue ever? You're arguing against literal information posted by Blizzard, they even went to the lengths of posting that to the reddit thread to clarify. If you want to be THAT stubborn then suit yourself out, I'm done. It's like having an argument with a flat earther thinking he's right, surely you can relate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so you want to assume that blizz has planned for every possible situation? ok, how would blizz respond to a person getting mugged, losing their phone and wallet, and having no cash. that is a possible scenario and you think blizz will be prepared for it. how would you admit a person who has no ticket, no proof of purchase, and no ID?</div></div><hr />

i'll stop when blizz either changes the ticket system they are using, actually specify a system people can use that doesn't involve using the phone app, or you people actually give me a good reason i shouldn't be skeptical. and no, &quot;because blizz has a help desk&quot; isn't a good reason since we don't know what the help desk consists of.</div></div><hr />

which i amended after realizing my mistake. so are you trying to make me look bad? cause i fail to see how i do. i made a mistake? i fixed it. i point out that a system doesn't have any known details, i'm grasping at straws. i'd really like to know how i'm being unreasonable but all i keep getting is people with blind faith in blizzard. shame i can't get someone who thinks beyond how much money they've given to a company.<br />
<br />
should i also point out i never told anyone to not go or to not have fun? you do you, i'm just trying to inform people. possible info was brought to my attention, it had no meat, so i rightfully ignored it.<br />

<br />
if spreading the truth is fear mongering, then no. i never told people not to go or to not have a fun time. i'm just telling people what to realistically expect. if people want to ignore me, that's on them. also, complaining about bad business practices is how you get things changed. if no one complained about bad business practices, there would still be children in the US working in mines for pennies.</div></div><hr />

Can this moronic fearmongering stop?<br />

And it's not like there's a lot of people from other countries (they always clamor about how many countries are represented during the opening ceremony).<br />
<br />
It's also the first year where I don't even feel like watching the free stream of the opening ceremony where they will announce the next expansion. I'm still giving a slight fuck and hoping that somehow, Classic might snatch me back to the fabled land of nostalgia for when Blizzard was not entirely rotted by Activision...</div></div><hr />

You know the ones complaining on forums are a fraction of the player base right? In almost any game the ones being silent not bothering with the communities are the biggest group.<br />

The one complaining aren't the ones going beyond a hypocrite here and there. Most that goes probably enjoy going.</div></div><hr />

<br />
should i also point out i never told anyone to not go or to not have fun? you do you, i'm just trying to inform people. possible info was brought to my attention, it had no meat, so i rightfully ignored it.<br />

if spreading the truth is fear mongering, then no. i never told people not to go or to not have a fun time. i'm just telling people what to realistically expect. if people want to ignore me, that's on them. also, complaining about bad business practices is how you get things changed. if no one complained about bad business practices, there would still be children in the US working in mines for pennies.<br />

None of those links are from a respectable source on mobile application security.<br />
Your first post was a YouTube content creator/social commentator who is no different to a random person on the street providing an opinion. (maybe ask Brian Krebs or Brian Honan for their opinion)<br />
<br />
Link something from a ACTUAL professional and then you have validity to your assertion. At this stage it’s simply hearsay.<br />
<br />
Regardless, your original post made an assertion without evidence and then your reply to a response was to say “provide evidence!”<br />
<br />
Hence my comment to say it was ironic.<br />
<br />
(I don’t care about this topic, I just wanted to point out the irony but then it seems you got upset so I’ve replied)</div></div><hr />

that's a fair enough point. I suppose I assumed that knowledge about axs was common by now but you still have a point. I will see what I can dig up from a professional source then.<br />

<br />
https://appgrooves.com/app/axs-tickets-concerts-and-sports-by-axs-digital-llc (the overall score says 4.4 out of 5 but 80% of the comments are negative with some even saying that after using axs, they started receiving fraud charges on their cards. I think axs might've botted this score higher or paid off the company)<br />
<br />
https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/axs-tickets/id679805463?mt=8 (i think this might be the same. now i couldn't find a way to look at more than just the shown reviews but how can an app have 80% (ish) of their ratings be 5 stars with all their reviews shown being 1 star?)<br />
<br />
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.axs.android&amp;hl=en_US<br />
<br />
i didn't cherry pick the search results. i went through every website i could find that offered ratings (you'd be surprised how hard it is to find a professional review of the axs app, the only review i could find was a blog post and i don't even think it was the same company because the blog was about paying bills.) my specific search line was &quot;axs mobile app professional review&quot;. i also tried professional opinion, blizzcon to require app, and blizzcon axs policy. all i could find was tons of videos for schedules of shows for specific groups and the app store fronts which i linked (along with the better business bureau). i'm not happy i couldn't find a professional review but i don't have all day to look sadly.</div></div><hr />

fair enough. though it does beg the question, why does axs keep those ridiculous requirements listed if they don't use most of them? it also seems weird to me that they want access to bluetooth but i'm not familiar with everything that bluetooth can do so maybe there is a real purpose. however, this doesn't mean the company isn't bad. the amount and severity of complaints i came across while looking up info tells me this company, at the least, isn't a great company to do business with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they have to have them listed in the event they do get used. <br />
The company provides certain services. Even if services are used only 1% of the time, they still need to have ToS in place to cover themselves, as well as any third party that becomes involved and the users/customers of the services.<br />
The majority of the complaints I have seen have come from the customer service side of things. I’ve seen some where people complained about getting refunds or issues with tickets being transferred, and that does suck and provides bad PR, but not for the alleged reasoning of spyware and selling data.</div></div><hr />

Quick Recap: about a month ago news broke of an EXTREMELY accurate emulator that was strictly invite only and filled with NDA, someone broke NDA and showed it off to the world, SCORE (Secret Cabal of Reverse Engineers) released the Homecoming server a few days before the 15 year anniversary of the game launch. Server has 4 Shards, and with the Emulator Data people can actually set their own servers up.<br />
