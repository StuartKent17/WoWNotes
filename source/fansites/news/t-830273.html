Various classes boost/nerfs<br />
We're currently in a position on the PTR where we can test and see how changes are affecting the various classes. We're still working to make changes that benefit the game without suddenly putting things into full tilt. The decisions being made are about what we see as being potentially more beneficial without being &quot;too much&quot;. That includes whether or not the mana regen really matters in comparison to being able to do more healing etc. The question becomes, if you're able to put out a bit more healing for the mana cost than you were doing before, is the mana regen boost worth it or is it just adding &quot;too much?&quot;<br />
<br />
As this is on the PTR currently, the answers will be found there with testing. I highly suggest loading it up and providing constructive feedback on your experiences there so that we can take a look at your experiences, match them with what others are experiencing, and then take a look at our own numbers and experiences to see where they line up or go off kilter.<br />
<br />
We're still in the process of making changes and adjustments (and will continue to do so even after it's live as necessary) and really like getting the constructive feedback now while we can still make these adjustments. We may not always agree with you, but please don't doubt that we're not at least rolling the ideas and thoughts you all have around in our heads a bit before saying, &quot;no.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150961/healer-nerfs))<br />
<br />
Haste affecting skills (This change has been reverted in today's notes)<br />
It looks like the haste change either didn't make it into the PTR build or is bugged. Steady Shot, Cobra Shot and Slam don't appear to be affected by the haste change. Some hunters might be noticing more focus, but that's more than likely from the Hunting Party bug fix. We're still investigating.<br />
<br />
To clarify on haste affecting SS and CS - - haste did lower their cast time before but it was a rather old implementation and (although I don't know the technical reasons behind it) there was a desire to update it. The designers wanted to change how Slam works with haste, and getting that code change from the programmers in turn allowed them to handle the hunter shots in a more elegant way as well. Ideally. In retrospect the changes probably shouldn't have even made the patch notes because it was a behind the scenes code change (which happens all the time) and not a meaningful redesign. On the other hand, it's likely some slight differences would be noticed in the shot behavior which might have had some impact on people's DPS and gearing. But, as I said, it's not working correctly and I'm not sure what the next steps are going to be. Whether the fix goes in or doesn't, the effect on SS and CS will be minimal-to-non-existent. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150741/well-fellow-hunters-it-was-fun))<br />
<br />
Classes with too much AE Damage<br />
Frost DKs and Demo Locks were definitely doing too much AE damage on fights. We knew once we got those under control that Serpent Spread might be next. AE abilities of every class were nerfed coming into Cataclysm, yet when some players compare their AE damage to that of DKs, locks, and hunters, they were left scratching their heads. We don’t think Serpent Spread is as big a problem as those other abilities, and if we over-nerfed it, then we’ll back those changes out. If you've actually tested the changes and have feedback we definitely welcome it, or even proper theorycrafting by those with an abacus and slide rule, but just seeing a patch note and commenting on it isn't very helpful for us to get good feedback passed along. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150741/well-fellow-hunters-it-was-fun))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..hunter) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1118-Hunter-Cataclysm))<br />
Survival Nerfs<br />
The patch isn't finished. Our intent is to bring Survival DPS down to the level of some of the other dps specs while making Marks and BM more attractive in PvE. With pure DPS classes it is probably impossible to engineer a three-way tie on all encounters. However, we think we can make them close enough so that players can choose to play their favorite without feeling like they are a burden on the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
For an overall approach, we made a few changes that will buff Survival, or even hunters in general. First, focus generation was lower as a result of a bug with haste buffs such as Hunting Party. We've fixed that bug, so focus generation will be higher now when that buff is present (presumably all the time for Survival). Second, we made Steady Shot scale with haste, which will let hunters get more attacks in overall and have more focus with which to do so. These changes would have been a net buff for Survival without additional nerfs to compensate.<br />
<br />
[...] Bottom line is that Survival does too much damage right now on live. The damage needs to come down. We'll be working to make sure the final numbers take into account all the other various changes that are going in to the patch to ensure it remains a viable spec, ensure the other two specs are competitively viable as well, and in-range of what we expect the damage output of the class to be relative to others. <br />
<br />
We're evaluating hunter DPS even now, and if it turns out the changes go too far we'll make adjustments. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150741/well-fellow-hunters-it-was-fun))<br />
<br />
PvP changes<br />
On PvP, we don't think high damage is the key to hunter success. The Deterrence and Master's Call changes are intended to help to that end and make some defensive mechanics a little less tricky to use. Again, we'll continue evaluating the changes. The patch isn't going live tomorrow. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150741/well-fellow-hunters-it-was-fun))<br />

Frost &quot;buff&quot;<br />
We did buff Frost Bolt. And we did buff Ice Lance when Fingers of Frost is up. However, we've decreased all Frost damage to Frozen targets by about 15% from previous values. The net result is intended to be that Frost Bolt is a little better against non-Frozen targets, and about the same versus Frozen targets. Ice Lance with FoF is still good, but Ice lance damage against Frozen targets is down a bit.<br />
<br />
The intent isn't to nerf PvE frost at all, but instead reward Frost Bolt use in PvP a bit more, and reduce the damage and effectiveness of Ice Lance in PvP.<br />
<br />
The important take away here is that datamined changes from pre-release builds and tests are not accurate ways for you to get information on intended game adjustments.

Sin and Punishment diminishing returns<br />
Thanks for pointing this out, Ecnad. We're aware of the issue and will be hotfixing this bug with diminishing returns and Sin and Punishment in the near future. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/151126/shadow-sin-and-punishment-needs-attention))<br />

Lightwell / Priests Changes<br />
This was, indeed, a correction to the tooltip and not a change to Lightwell. It has not been nerfed in the next patch and while there have been some changes done, they should predominantly result in better healing overall (in relation to priests). To check out the hotfixes that were implemented prior to the PTR, you can see them here. http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1232869 You'll notice Lightwell's health was boosted up by 50%.<br />
<br />
The change we are making are a little bit like balancing scales. We trim a little on one side and add to the other. If you look through the PTR notes ( http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2011384 ) closely, you'll see this within them.<br />
<br />
Currently, Holy has a lot of mana on live, but to counter the change we're making to Prayer of Healing, we're buffing Circle of Healing. We’re making Chakra easier to use. We’re also giving you the option to make Prayer of Mending a little better. Holy on live is pretty strong overall.<br />
<br />
As we said in the Wow, Dungeons are Hard blog, ( http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2053469 ) any Holy priest with 1700 to 1800 Spirit shouldn’t have mana problems. If they do, something else is going on such as dps being too low or players taking too much avoidable damage. You can reach those numbers without ever stepping into a raid. Finish Twilight Highlands. Get the Cord of the Raven Queen epic belt from being Exalted with the Guardians of Hyjal – you’ll be Revered just by completing the Hyjal quests. Max out your Tailoring and make yourself some better gear or just buy some from another player. Get the Mandala of Stirring Patterns trinket from Tol Barad (the quest area – it doesn’t require setting foot in the PvP area). Look for Sprit enchants. Reforging is your friend. Reforge everything to Spirit until you feel that you won’t run out of mana.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, you're not alone in the dungeon and the dps and tanks also need to take responsibility for what they are doing and how much of your mana they are requiring you to use. You also don't need to keep everyone topped off. You just need to anticipate the damage and adjust accordingly.<br />
<br />
We want people to pick and choose the spells and abilities they need to use in correlation to the events going on in the game. If someone still has Prayer of Mending on them and they haven't taken damage yet, do you need to recast it? Does someone need a shield or renew vs. a full heal? Can you use something else in your bag of tricks that you normally would just bypass as &quot;useless&quot; that would instead by useful in a certain situation? Can you use binding heal? You may just need to cast a high expense spell to get the job done, but if you have the mana to do so, why not? Those spells are meant to have use.<br />
<br />
I've also looked into Discipline in light of the change to Prayer of Healing. In general, there shouldn't be a time that there is so much AoE damage that everyone is going to need it immediately. Raids may be a little different, but you should have plenty of support from other healers as well at that point.<br />
<br />
The cost of shield may have gone up, but so has the damage mitigation for it, though in light of Cataclysm, damage mitigation isn't all a Discipline priest needs to do anymore. They need to be in there, mixing it up and healing versus just using a few spells. Don't forget you also have Power Word:Barrier if you can convince people not to run away from the glow y dome of goodness.<br />
<br />
Divine Aegis was also buffed a bit and with Inner Fire should help with Prayer of Healing.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, this is just a short list of changes, and the rest can be found on the PTR notes and more are being added practically daily at this point. Changes are still ongoing as well. Continuing to provide constructive feedback on these changes and how you've been experiencing them (for those that go on the PTR) is always very helpful.

As for hunters allowed to autoshot while moving, hurray! The old mechanic, while interesting and characteristic of a skilled hunter (staggering movement to get yout autoshots cast) was extremely unintuitive and badly affected pvp. Moreover this should help marksmanship scale better with its mastery.</div></div><hr />

I agree on that and it was an interesting skill to master that gave you a feeling of achievement. But honestly, do you consider this intuitive gameplay? This was very peculiar behavior; no other class had something similar.</div></div><hr />

they overbuff hunter now, last build was fine but again buffs for mm? seriously<br />

Last build was not fine. SV was nerfed too hard.<br />
And I have no idea if you really look at meters, but SV is doing almost double the dps of a MM hunter. So those specs need a buff, and so does BM.</div></div><hr />

There's an option in the Interface that you can turn on, that makes you stop attacking when you switch targets.<br />

<br />
The Leatherworking bracer enchants provide 130 in Agility, Strength and Intellect. The other profession bonuses are, generally, an increase of 80 in Agility, Strength or Intellect. It's a relatively safe bet that these enchants are intended to be for non-Leatherworkers on bracers. I was surprised that these enchants didn't exist at launch, so I guess they're correcting that oversight now - Leatherworking was just far and away better than most other professions in terms of the benefit it gave for a lot of classes. Even more glad that I switched to Alchemy rather than Leatherworking now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what you do when you don't have things other healers have, like shields, high armor, etc... Biggest problem was the instant root glyph imo which was completely op for every spec. With that gone I don't see any need to nerf shapeshifting even more. It's a class defining ability. That's like taking away frost nova or charges. (which they did to some degree, poor warris) <br />
I just hope this doesn't go live like this. As I mainly play resto I can break roots with travel form of with a dispel but that's really not why I play druid in the first place. Shapeshifting is fun, don't take it away because some people whine about feral mobility (I guess this is where the nerf is coming from). Or just take the root breaking effect from cat form if the mobility is really such a huge problem. Shifting into travel form and then in cat form wastes precious GCD which would smooth out the dmg a little bit. Or just fix the damn dots. No feral, especially ferals who played more than just in cata to be a FOTM class wants that dots are so high. Especially when things like shred hits and crits like a wet noodle. They are trying to fix this but lets see how this really turns out. Shred needs to be at around 30% of your dmg and rip/rake at around 15%. This is how it was, this is how it worked. Feral was about positioning and complex rotation not a nub-fest where you rake, mangle, mangle, rip run away. That's bullshit and everyone knows this.<br />
<br />
TL;DR:<br />
Leave class defining skills untouched and think of something better Blizz!</div></div><hr />

SV pulls 20k dps easily while MM struggles to break 15k. Why? Because of crap changes in talent trees - for example - where are old good iterations of Marked for Death or Master Marksman? Those were straight dps increases, really good ones. You knew you can't go wrong with them. And now? They are joke - free GCD that you don't spend on putting HM and ability to shoot Aimed once a year sure are helping to pump some good looking numbers, not like those lousy 5% pet and shot damage along with increased crit damage. Piercing shots are losing way too much due to lack of that boosted crit chance below 80% hp and Aimed shot being now 'proc' shot and not actual part of rotation. MM wil never recover if the tree will be flooded with talents like RiF, Bombardment, Concussive Barrage or weak and powerless incarnations of MfD and MM. Mastery and tree special perks don't look good to. Good way to start would be to change 15% increased auto shot damage to physical damage, so Steady shot will get some oomph and procced Aimed critting for 7k won't make hunters /facepalm each time they see it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I thought the same. Mana gaining spells are problematic nowadays as they really can trivialize an encounter. With hymn of hope for 3 people, divine plea for the pala alone and innervate for the druid alone, 2 glyphed you really wonder why Mana tide is so strong. It always was a class defining ability but is should be at least on par to the other skills especially when it scales like crazy with spirit/spirit trinkets and everyone else scales with int. Otherwise you're screwed if you don't have a shaman in a group which goes completely against the design philosophy of bring the player not the class. :)<br />
<br />
Some sort of change for divine plea, innervate and hymn of hope would be nice so that it scales with spirit too.</div></div><hr />

Auto shot while moving is a nice buff, indeed. But it's hardly game breaking in neither the PvE or PvP aspect of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im not saying balancing is bad, mkay? Its good but this looks like some RPG char hitting a monster: Crit (Cataclysm) - Miss (patch) - Dodge (hotfix) - Miss (patch) - Dodge (hotfix) - Miss (patch)<br />
<br />
If you get what im saying, the monster is customer dissatisfaction and if they continue missing and dodging attacks the char might be killed by the one hit point left in the monster.<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHHAHAHA Nice image...<br />
And I'm sure the HP bar is the number of players online, and the points left is the number of players actually reaching end of Heroics. There might be a huge discrepancy in numbers, that even GC can't pretend isn't there.<br />
Seriously, all this speech that &quot;heroics, heal, tanking have to matter&quot; looks like a &quot;look at me, look what have I done&quot; chat. I bet that GC don't find it cool when the postal agents makes send a package a hard thing, because &quot;it have to matter&quot;; or when IRS makes his live miserable, and gives a speech on how important is to have an accountant and how keep receipts are necessary; or when health insurance says that they can't give free stuff to everyone... Yeah, not cool when is not you saying that stuff, right Greg?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only the last rope, you still have to hop on it twice and swing away so you don't become a crispy critter.<br />
Chaos beat me by two minutes. :&lt;<br />
<br />
I don't get why they're removing that last swing, though. Were folks like, actually standing around, thinking they killed her, not noticing the (in-game, even!) warning text popping up saying &quot;CRAP SHE'S GONNA EXPLODE GET OUT&quot;, and then everyone dying and causing them to lose the fight or something? Even if one person swings away successfully, you win.<br />
<br />
That's one of those changes that I really do not get.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tailoring<br />
* Illusionary Bag now has 26 slots.<br />
<br />
That's a pretty awesome change. When it was only 24 slots, the pattern was essentially useless due to the immense costs of making one (8 dreamcloth + 1 more to buy pattern), as you can buy a 24 slot bag from Haris Pilton for only 3K. That put an upper limit on the selling price on the AH, which is way less than actual cost of making them. As far as I know, this is now the only 26-slot bag available, which makes them very worthwhile and likely very pricey.<br />
<br />
For those that don't know, 1 dreamcloth = 8 bolts of embersilk + 30 volatile of any type except shadow. They can also be created using excess Chaos Orbs, however those are extremely difficult to obtain reliably right now, obviously. You can make 1 of each variety every seven days (except the chaos orb one), so you can likely only make a bag every other week. Since a bolt of embersilk = 5 embersilk cloth, a single illusionary bag = 320 embersilk cloth + 240 volatiles = $$$$$$$$<br />
<br />
I except these to now sell on the AH for a very large sum of gold.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: I have a total Awkward B over this change right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're either braindead or still living in BC, but there's so much wrong with your post I don't even know where to start.<br />
<br />
- Aspect of the Monkey hasn't been in the game since Cata. Dragonhawk is gone, too. We have no way to increase our dodge and start off with -5% dodge baseline.<br />
- The Beast Within hasn't given immunity in a long time. It breaks ONE CC/Movement Impairing Effect. After that, the hunter can be CC'd throughout the entire duration of the buff. <br />
- If you're a warrior losing to hunters, l2play.<br />
<br />
This change has been needed for a LONG time and it never made any sense at all why we, as a physical DPS class, could not do our white damage on the move without stutter-stepping to make sure we hit every auto-swing in time. It was a bad mechanic and severely gimped our damage output in PVP environments compared to other physical DPS classes.</div></div><hr />

Biggest problem was the instant root glyph imo which was completely op for every spec. With that gone I don't see any need to nerf shapeshifting even more. It's a class defining ability. That's like taking away frost nova or charges. (which they did to some degree, poor warris) <br />
I just hope this doesn't go live like this. As I mainly play resto I can break roots with travel form of with a dispel but that's really not why I play druid in the first place. Shapeshifting is fun, don't take it away because some people whine about feral mobility (I guess this is where the nerf is coming from). Or just take the root breaking effect from cat form if the mobility is really such a huge problem. Shifting into travel form and then in cat form wastes precious GCD which would smooth out the dmg a little bit. Or just fix the damn dots. No feral, especially ferals who played more than just in cata to be a FOTM class wants that dots are so high. Especially when things like shred hits and crits like a wet noodle. They are trying to fix this but lets see how this really turns out. Shred needs to be at around 30% of your dmg and rip/rake at around 15%. This is how it was, this is how it worked. Feral was about positioning and complex rotation not a nub-fest where you rake, mangle, mangle, rip run away. That's bullshit and everyone knows this.<br />
<br />
TL;DR:<br />
Leave class defining skills untouched and think of something better Blizz!<br />
<br />
You are right, shapeshifting is your class defining ability.... not breaking all movement impairments, just shapeshifting.<br />
<br />
Dont act like blizzard destroyed your class, the choice to roll a druid should not come down to the fact that you can break crowd controls whenever you want, and if thats the only reason you rolled a druid then you really should not be allowed to put any feedback in towards the class because you are obviously an idiot.</div></div><hr />

Actually frost is already only a few percent behind unholy, and thats only on single target fights. After these nerf frost dw will pull ahead by quite a bit. I find frost much more interesting, though very dependant on RE and KM procs, which can really screw you over.</div></div><hr />

The act of shapeshifting originally removed 3 different things: polymorph, roots and snares. When 2/3 of the initial reason why shapeshifting was interesting are gone the overall class defining ability loses more and more appeal.<br />

For the most part, mana tide only helps those in a healer spec, and currently raids will stack the healers in a single group so they all can benefit from mana tide. In 10 man raids, you have 2-3 healers, so having this change means that you don't have to put all the healers in a single group. In 25 man, you have 7-8 healers, which means that an additional 2-3 healers get the buff.<br />
<br />
This is more aimed at BG pvp. When I'm in a BG, members of the same group will often get separated. This buff is to ensure that all the healers in your area has an opportunity to benefit from it. My hope is that eventually all abilities will be redesigned to work with the entire raid. For shamans, this still includes, grounding totem, tremor totem, and healing stream.</div></div><hr />

Err, why not? Worgen certainly didn't roam around Lordaeron at the time :S<br />
What? Worgen are older than lordaeron, it's an encient night elf shapeshift/curse, it's been on azeroth since like forever</div></div><hr />

If this stuff goes live, I'll find a way to adapt like I always do since I'm a stubborn pain in the ass, but Blizzard really needs to sit back and think for a minute about what they're doing to the fundamental components of &quot;PVE&quot; when they go and make these changes or &quot;PVP&quot;. Do I think druids have a little bit of an advantage in &quot;PVP&quot; because of our various immunities and the like? Heck yeah I do, I'd be a fool to say otherwise, but making a change to &quot;PVP&quot; like removing heroism in arenas and the like as they did for Shaman, DOES NOT MEAN you have to remove the same ability in &quot;PVE&quot;. <br />
<br />
Imagine if Blizz just took heroism out entirely instead of just removing it in PVP... what would the entire community say to that? And if you can do things like that in PVP where you selectively disable things, then make these changes PVP only, stop trying to tell me that my bear isn't allowed to do the things I've been doing since forever and either A) Give me some new tools to enjoy to counter these PVP-oriented nerfs, or B) Just make them PVP only. That is all, but hopefully Blizz will think before they act on this stuff... but we'll see... plenty of time before the PTR patch goes live hopefully!</div></div><hr />

<br />
With NS being nerfed, the damage is already bad enough as it is (in PVP).<br />
<br />
I agree. &quot;Needed&quot; mobility buffs in, but coming with it are huge damage/effectiveness nerfs to NS, 5% less STR bonus, Pet damage, DC (wtf?). Welcome back to final Wrath season DK play again, aka, non-existent in tournaments, and when used, CoI is on every action. Nerf NS, fine. Leave PVE alone though. Oh, what's that? Frost isn't doing as much PVE damage? NO PROBLEM, just nuke down Unholy.<br />
<br />
I'm actually finally getting tired of this game due to the retarded sweeping (yes, sweeping) changes made each time. Glad to see all those hunter buffs too, now maybe they can (when in the hands of a skilled player) destroy every class in the game again.</div></div><hr />
