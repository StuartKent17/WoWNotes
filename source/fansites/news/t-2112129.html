BlizzCon Developer Interview<br />
Vanion (http://www.vanion.eu/news/blizzcon-2016-unser-interview-mit-lead-game-designer-matt-goss-15973) had the chance to talk to Matt Goss, a Lead Game Designer on WoW.<br />

<br />
There is no cap on the number of legendary items you can obtain. <br />
You can repeat the legendary item quest line to upgrade multiple legendary items. <br />
Ahn'qiraj Remembrance Day lets your faction fly a flag in Silithus. It is region wide so it will be their first attempt to do a race between the two factions. <br />
The team tries to make sure everyone can do all of the Brawler's Guild bosses. There aren't any bosses that require a healing or tank spec, as everyone can fall back to a DPS spec.<br />
There won't be a new bonus roll currency for Nighthold. <br />
Mythic+ dungeons will have the max item level rewarded increased when Nighthold comes out, similar to what was done for Trial of Valor.<br />
The team is always looking for new Keystone affixes, but they are mostly happy with how they have turned out so far. Everyone has one that they hate!<br />
The team isn't sure if you will need to get all 20 points in the final Artifact Trait before you can progress towards the new golden trait in Patch 7.2. Anyone who plays Legion shouldn't feel any regret on how they spent Artifact Power in Patch 7.2.<br />
There are no plans to make it easier to switch specs and Artifact Weapons. Artifact Knowledge allows you to catch up fairly quickly. <br />
The team doesn't just look at damage numbers when balancing tanks. They also have to look at utility, how much damage they take, how much healing they need to be viable, and more. <br />
The choice in Patch 7.2 on what to build for the new base is region wide. The team will see how it works in playtesting. The world should feel cohesive. <br />
New World Bosses will be added in the upcoming patches. <br />
The team doesn't want to maintain multiple caps on how high items can randomly upgrade. When Patch 7.2 is released, everything will be able to upgrade to the new max item level. <br />
Patch 7.2 will add better crafted gear, but they haven't decided if it will be through more Obliterum or a new system. Professions should stay relevant. <br />
The team wanted to try the new Karazhan experience before they added a version you can queue for. There are still a lot of players that don't want to do Mythic dungeons or don't want to find the group to do it. These players should be able to experience Karazhan too. <br />

BlizzCon 2016 - Blizzard Engineering Panel<br />
Along with the WoW Engineering panel (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6108-BlizzCon-2016-Engineering-Panel-WoW-Account-Actions-Quick-Join-Toasts-Q-A-Time), there was also a Blizzard Engineering panel not on the stream on Day 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TncmMfGxfU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Heroes is a fun game to work on because the team likes to do the impossible. The team was working on Cho'gall and someone came up with the idea for him to carry his horse. Mounting assumes that you have a horse under you that is playing a running animation and the character model plays an animation in sync with that. This was very hard to change, especially with a week left before the BlizzCon build had to be finalized. He ended up riding an invisible horse, playing a running animation, and had an added horse on his shoulder. The team eventually went back and improved the mount code. You can see this with Ragnaros, his trails are a custom special mount. <br />
About a year before Legion launch, a designer came to the team and pitched Khadgar casting a spell in Dalaran that would teleport everyone to the Broken Isles at the same time. Teleporting the entire population of WoW at the same moment was a bit farfetched. The team used the new Automation team to determine what they actually could do. How many people could they teleport? What is the rate they could teleport people at? Could they really teleport everyone all at once? After a lot of testing they determined how many people could be teleported at once and went back to design with the current implementation. Players got a quest between 11:45 and midnight that allowed them to teleport over. Historically there was a lot of lag and latency during the first couple days of an expansion launch. An engineer suggested splitting up the world in a way that left it populated but also smooth, which was dynamic sharding. It measures the population of players and creates a new shard when the population approaches a target that the team set. This way you always feel like you are in a full world but don't have the bad experience that comes with an overpopulated world. This tech was first seen during the Demon Invasions during the pre-expansion event. During launch day everyone went to Dalaran and the sharding split up the population. All of the new Dalaran shards were spun up ahead of release so that everything was smooth. <br />
The first implementation of Play of the Game in Overwatch Beta just looked at how well you were performing in regards to kills. If you got a lot of kills in an eight second period you would win the Play of the Game. The team originally also considered showing each player their own Play of the Game, but it felt cooler to watch the best Play of the Game. The second iteration on this looked at actions players took that were not kills, such as saving another player's life or shutting down someone's ultimate. Now the game also keeps track of interruptions to someone who is going to do something to your team. For example, it will track how many people McCree has in his sight for the ultimate, so if you stop him from getting the kills the game knows and assigns a score based on the number of people you saved. Each of the categories are weighted and the Play of the Game can now be something that isn't just a lot of kills. The team is still iterating on the system and has plans for improvements, such as camera improvements and tweaking of existing categories. <br />
Hearthstone went with Unity as their engine in the interest of speed. The server is a custom C++ program. <br />
Designers script a card using their custom scripting system and all of that happens on the server side. The server is where all of the rules exist, it just tells the client what happened. With Yogg, secrets didn't work, choice cards didn't work, but they got far enough to get a feel for it. It then was tasked to a gameplay programmer to fix secrets. Fixing the rest of the things resulted in moving the card implementation into the C++ code rather than the scripting language used by designers. <br />
The team looks for people that have actually finished a project, everyone can have a cool idea and start on it, but actually finishing is something special. The other thing they look for is passion and how you demonstrate that passion. People that don't just do work for school, but instead work on something outside of that. <br />
You can also target your projects towards the company or team you want to work for. This helps to show your passion and ability to complete things, as well as bringing your work to the attention of people actually working on the product. <br />
One of the Hearthstone gameplay engineers applied to Blizzard with lots of Unity projects under his belt. He also played a lot of TCG games.<br />
Originally the realm itself would be responsible for running the instance servers. Some realms are very populated and some are less populated, so when hardware was allocated in that way the high population realms were utilizing all of the hardware while lower population realms were sitting almost idle. <br />
The team then took all of the instance servers and put them into a pool. This allowed the higher population realms to use more resources and the lower population realms weren't so idle. This took a lot of engineering effort. <br />
The Overwatch has a QA team that sits on the same floor as the developers and all of the different engineering disciplines leverage that team. The QA team will attend all of the meetings and design discussions so that they are aware of all of the changes coming. When the team is implementing features, ideally the QA team is already ready with a test plan to make sure the feature is pretty close to bug free. Occasionally there are some larger features that are too big for the internal QA team to test, so the team will ask if there are any QA people on other game teams that want to spend some time testing the new feature. One example of when this was done is the Halloween event. <br />
Originally there was a mobile team at Blizzard, separate from the Hearthstone team. They were working on things like the mobile armory. The Hearthstone team borrowed people to help get Hearthstone shippable and then kept them. Eventually the mobile team got absorbed into Team 5. <br />
The Legion Companion app was developed by some engineers on the WoW team using Unity. They consulted with the Hearthstone team a lot. They abstracted out Battle.Net management code for Hearthstone so that it can be reused across multiple projects that are being worked on. <br />
Blizzard makes use of hundreds of open source projects. They don't contribute as much as they probably could and that is something they are looking into. You can find some things on their Github (https://github.com/Blizzard).<br />
Hearthstone sends what happened in the game to the client, but it doesn't actually save this data anywhere, so the server can't replay what happened when you temporarily lose your network connection. They could also do a better job of chunking up assets. The team has spent time optimizing things on mobile, such as loading of XML files or the art assets. The server side doesn't do a great job of saving state. There is just a current state that gets sent to the client when you reconnect. <br />
The team pushed hard from the beginning of Overwatch to have automation be a big part of testing. The team wanted to be able to reliably do things like stress testing things before they go live. What happens when half a million players suddenly start playing? What happens when the servers are overloaded? What happens to game stability when new features are added? It is hard to keep track of things that break that no one really tests. Automation was seen as the solution to many of these problems. It has been really successful so far, allowing the team to stress test servers before they went live and test every single build. The team uses headless clients to automate gameplay and ensure that a build is okay. <br />
For WoW, the team has functional testing. People do black box testing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing) that catches problems without automation. WoW does have build verification testing. If the client has performance problems, having a bot teleport around to measure framerate and find hot spots is helpful. The team also did a full scale test for Legion launch, having lots of clients connecting to test things for launch. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PSA: Underwater-only mounts should now move faster! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/796434974953979904))<br />
As fast as Azure Water Striders? Because right now thats pretty much all anyone who isnt a DK is using. No alternatives. =/<br />
they're not meant to be used as surface mounts (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/796442804519989249))<br />
I bought water walking potions just so I could not use my water strider<br />
The idea that the water strider is so good that you can't use anything else is noted, no update tho. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/796443482726404097))<br />

BlizzCon Cosplay - Ragnaros<br />
There was lots of great cosplay at BlizzCon, including this Ragnaros by Danielle Beaulieu (https://twitter.com/DanielleCosplay/status/796815977166073857). Ragnaros is coming to Heroes of the Storm (http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1809-heroes-at-blizzcon-varian-ragnaros-heroes-new) along with Varian! <br />

<br />
I feel like giving out life advice that you should never ever ever honestly tell an employer what you're passionate about (they'll abuse that knowledge), that something that is your passion should be pursued on your terms, in your own time, when you can fully enjoy it, and to only try to cash in on your passion if it's for more than a six figure sum, and a lot of respect from your new employer (knew a guy who tried to cash in on his passion too fast, employer treated him like shit because 'hey I thought you WANTED to be here?', guy ultimately had his passion ruined and quit the 'dream' job)... but I also feel/hope most of us already know all this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have never felt the need to use the water strider. In fact I don't even have one. I have no idea what everyone is moaning about.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are still a lot of players that don't want to do Mythic dungeons or don't want to find the group to do it. These players should be able to experience Karazhan too. <br />
<br />
Now this concerns me deeply. I feel some massive nerfs incoming just to cater to these people. If you don't want to do it, or don't want to group up to do it, why should you have a voice in the content you don't want to do? Defeats the entire point. I don't want to raid mythic, should mythic be nerfed so I can experience it? I don't want to have flying, should the entire playerbase be prevented from flying just so I don't have to?

<br />
You actually sound like a special snowflake with this kind of comment.<br />
<br />
I agree that Blizzard cater to casuals but it is not about nerfing Mythic content, it's about letting a large portion of the playerbase enjoy the content on lower difficulty settings. Mythic will still be there with its difficulty for raiders who have the chance to have a good guild to run hard Kara.</div></div><hr />

I find it questionable that someone even thought about putting the new golden trait behind a trait that takes 60 million AP to fully unlock.<br />

<br />
Indeed, especially since i don't think that most of the playerbase even hit level 25 yet. It looks entirely possible that anyone but the most hardcore of hardcores is going to get all the points before the artifacts are taken away. Kinda odd considering how class balancing also takes into account those points.</div></div><hr />

Now this concerns me deeply. I feel some massive nerfs incoming just to cater to these people. .<br />
<br />
what concerns me more deeply is that they denied grpahicaly amazing dungeons like court of stars and upper part karazhan (books room , vizdun fight sooooo cool thos are the thing which make people call - wow this game is amazing not 4 difficulties of same raid) from milions of players just to cater to top 5 % of nolifers . <br />
<br />
thos dungeons have amazing graphic quality and design - its criminal to withhold them from players.</div></div><hr />

Several people normally counter argument with what you just said but it makes no sense to me, since not having flying means no one can fly, while having flying means only the ones that want to fly will do it. If there is flying and someone doesn't want to use it, what stops them from only using ground mounts and fp like it is now? While the opposite can't be done.</div></div><hr />

What the heck does that mean? HotS is by no means filled with fresh ideas, it's just another MOBA. Oh, excuse me... hero brawler. The special needs kid version of a MOBA.

I feel some massive nerfs incoming just to cater to these people. If you don't want to do it, or don't want to group up to do it, why should you have a voice in the content you don't want to do? Defeats the entire point. I don't want to raid mythic, should mythic be nerfed so I can experience it? I don't want to have flying, should the entire playerbase be prevented from flying just so I don't have to? What's up with this damn entitlement culture Blizzard is catering to. Everyone's a special snowflake nowadays.<br />
<br />
<br />
ur twisting the context and making things up to make a point. To start with some people Can't do kara because they play a class or spec that OTHERS don't like making there time harder. What are u going to tell them to reroll or unsub? Yeah can't wait to see the millions of subs go away because u told them all to leave or reroll.<br />
<br />
So why is it not a bad idea to just have a heroic que for them so they can enjoy that content and story at least? Its not hurting u or ur play time. And at least they can enjoy kara with out been pissed on because they play a spec that others don't like because OMG its 0.00000000001% weaker then fire mages... Better ask people to be 30 IL above the gear that kara gives! wonders why people hate the Group making system........</div></div><hr />

People are going to get them nerfed into the ground again because they feel forced to use them. I use them like I use my expedition yak. I use them when I need to and swap to my other mounts when I don't. I have very very few areas in Broken Isles that even need the aqua strider. Unless I'm running around the entire continent or I'm crossing the river by Nesingwary's camp or Thunder Totem, there's no area I have yet to see that &quot;requires&quot; the aqua strider. If you don't like the aqua strider and feel &quot;forced&quot; to do it, then get water walking potions or get the fishing artifact. Otherwise, roll a DK or a shaman.<br />
<br />
I think the people who are arguing against flying are the same people trying to get aqua striders removed. They won't be happy until we all have to walk everywhere again. That group likely also has many of those who feel &quot;forced&quot; to run LFR. You aren't FORCED to do anything. No one is EVER holding a gun to your head saying you HAVE to do it this way or you die. The only one holding a metaphysical gun to your head is you, and if that's the case, you should be seeking mental help because it begs the question what else you feel &quot;forced&quot; to do but yet really aren't.<br />

Blizzard shouldn't do anything about the aqua striders except recommend those that are complaining about it to see a therapist.</div></div><hr />

It's incredibly disingenuous to say that having flying available doesn't affect people who you suggest should &quot;choose&quot; not to fly (as if that isn't the definition of a non-choice).<br />
<br />
Do you honestly have such a poor understanding of the WoW economy, for example, that you don't realize this? Do you honestly believe that flying is purely about getting from A to B faster?

Calling others children because they want something and you don't share their pov so you don't want it, while coming up with absurd arguments is at the very least hilarious. I really hope you read again what you wrote and try to see how your argument makes absolute no sense at all. You were saying in your example that because you decide to gather on a ground mount while others decide to gather in flying mounts will lower your game experience because you can't cover your raid costs as effectively is absurd. It's absurd because from that pov anything that isn't the most efficient way of doing something should not be ingame. An example is that people can farm AP from different ways, some are more efficient than others, but it comes down to preference and how people want to play the game. I assume that the fact some only run Maw mythic+ is destroying your experience since you rather run BRH therefore being more inefficient than them at AP farming, which is therefore ruining your raiding experience. See how absurd that argument is?! There is always a more efficient way of doing things, but not everyone takes that path and any less efficient path shouldn't be removed because of that.<br />
<br />
There are several points that could be made against flying that have some substance to it, yours isn't one of them.</div></div><hr />

Even better - get a tauren druid, get the &quot;faster loot herbs enchant&quot; for hands.<br />
Now you can fly around without dismounting and loot the herbs in like 0.2 sec.<br />
Oh, and if you get aggrod by a mob, you just loot and fly away. All others have to kill the mob first.<br />
<br />
You make around 80% more herbs/hour as any other class - well, not scientific proven by any statistics, but I guess 80% more is a good estimate.</div></div><hr />

You're looking at it wrong.<br />
<br />
Your experience hasn't changed... if there was no flying, you would still be gathering at the exact same speed.<br />
<br />
What you're actually complaining about is not being able to have your cake and eat it too... you don't want flying, but you don't want other people to have the increased efficiency from their ability to fly.<br />
<br />
Let's not pretend that flying is the only thing that increases efficiency in wow... almost every goal you have can be done more efficiently. Some depend on luck, some depend on your guild, some depend on your time slots, some depend on your friends, some depend on your reaction speed, etc... in this particular instance, you don't want to have to compete with a more efficient method, so you want to deny everyone the ability to use it.<br />
<br />
It's probably a good thing the game doesn't revolve around a single player such as yourself, eh?</div></div><hr />

Wow. Where to even begin? Firstly, flying really doesn't bother me in the slightest, so lets get that out of the way... HOWEVER, people claiming that choosing not to fly wouldn't have an impact on a player's experience, does bother me. Anybody who can see outside of their own little bubble should be able to identify this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Your experience hasn't changed... if there was no flying, you would still be gathering at the exact same speed.&quot;<br />
<br />
As would everybody else. However, in this example there is no flying for me, because I'm supposed to choose not to use it, and apparently making that choice doesn't alter my experience. This is the only point I'm addressing.<br />
<br />
Somehow my experience hasn't changed, despite the fact that in this example it takes me longer to gather herbs that everybody who isn't locked to this non-choice. My herbs that now sell for less, because everyone that doesn't make the choice not to fly is able to collect herbs far more efficiently than I, which (dramatically) increases the supply of herbs to the market, decreasing their price.<br />
<br />
If I relied on gathering to pay my subscription, for example, I may no longer be able to. Please explain how this hasn't changed my experience. <br />
For me, yes, nothing seems to have changed. I can still happily collect x herbs in y hours, as I always have. But I won't be paid $z for them anymore. It'll be a fraction of $z instead.<br />
<br />
Plenty of things increase efficiency in WoW, nobody is disputing that, no matter how many strawmen are crafted in these replies... But telling people that choosing not to ̶f̶l̶y̶ increase efficiency doesn't affect their experience in any way is utterly asinine. As is stating that others increasing their own efficiency can't affect anyone else.<br />
<br />
Ill restate that. You are insinuating that increasing efficiency doesn't affect your experience, That's complete and total garbage.</div></div><hr />

price goes up and down on mats all the time.<br />
and it's not that it takes YOU longuer to farm herbs, but it's faster for those that want flying.<br />
you don't care for flying being in game or not, or would prefer it not be reinstated, fine, but blizzard cather to the majority, and in this case you are not it.<br />

<br />
I didn't say that, I said it would take &quot;me&quot; (not me, &quot;me&quot; in the example) longer than people not locked to the non-choice of not flying, which is still true, and clearly still affects your earning potential; thus your experience is directly altered by others choosing to use it.<br />
<br />
&quot;you don't care for flying being in game or not, or would prefer it not be reinstated, fine, but blizzard cather to the majority, and in this case you are not it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I didn't say that either. I'm happy for flying to be in game... I'm happy that it's been delayed and gated too, I think that's also probably the best way to handle it given that there's no way Blizzard would dare to remove it now... and I don't even think they should. I just won't lie to people and tell them that their experience won't be affected by it, regardless of if they choose to use it or not.<br />

I hate highmountain and stormheim equally, for that reason... and that world quest in the cave.. FFS! :)<br />

Because you chose to fly, you can cover your raiding costs far more effectively than I can.<br />
<br />
Thus, me choosing not to fly has demonstrably lowered my game experience, with respect to raiding.<br />
<br />
Does that help you?<br />
<br />
Regardless, have a good one, I'm out! :)<br />
<br />
Umm no. That's not how you compare things. At least not in any realistic sort of way.<br />
By your arguments we should remove mounts entirely since lower level players can't even have them at all. Taking it to a further extreme -- let's remove running because it's unrealistic to run from one side of a continent to another.<br />
<br />
Truth is -- you can enjoy the game with flying you simply choose not to. Other people flying aren't lowing your experience -- your false limitations are. Not theirs. You're choosing to not fly is your choosing.<br />
<br />
So no, I'm going to say you are wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually after patch 7.x all new droped legendarys will be the higher ilvl. So, old ones aquired need to be upgraded, new ones are already upgraded.<br />
<br />
This is wrong. You are mistaking things.<br />
<br />
Since tomorrow (EU) / today (US) all legendary items will have base ilev of 910. The ones people already aquired will have the ilev automatically upped. The ones that will drop in the future will have ilev 910.<br />
<br />
When NH opens, there will be a questline to upgrade ilev of your legendary (was to 925 before the ilev boost, will probably be to 940 now). They now reveal you will be able to upgrade multiple legendaries through repetetive questline.</div></div><hr />

Gotta give those pro-cos-players their due. Its an ad for a skin in Heroes of the Storm. As they are adding it....<br />

&quot;The idea that the water strider is so good that you can't use anything else is noted&quot; = &quot;We're going to nerf this as hard as possible as quickly as possible.&quot;</div></div><hr />
