How ? Tier 1, 2 and 3 are 100% bullshit-y passive procs or enhancements you don't even care about except when you're looking at your recount<br />
<br />
<br />
The team wants item level to matter a lot more in BfA than secondary stats.<br />
<br />
Clear enough, they continue with their philosophy of &quot;this item is higher, i equip it without even looking at it&quot;. Damn, I hate this, for people like me who likes itemization and choosing your stuff, that's the killing blow.</div></div><hr />

Yes. Thats what he said. Personal loot will be the only loot system. Its a &quot;reasonable expectation&quot; that it will be the only loot system. I don't know who put this clown in charge. I don't even use any other loot myself but I know so many people who do. Don't take away choice from those people.<br />

They’re humans who wear a lot of green and own ships. The fact that some are skinny or fat doesn’t change their genetic makeup.<br />
<br />
But obviously the art team isn’t going to go back and redesign half the population of Stormwind and it’s territories with fat or skinny human NPC’s, even though they should. So I guess all the obese or anorexic humans live in Kul Tiras now, and when you mouse over them, the descriptor will be “Kul Tiran Human”.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So they want to eliminate about the only customization left to players.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personal Loot is the desired loot rule moving forward.<br />
<br />
Making changes for the sake of making changes. Better progression through targeted gearing is one of the few benefits of raiding with a guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
BfA will be similar to Legion in terms of alt-friendliness.<br />
<br />
So... Incredibly unfriendly? Its like they don't listen to feedback at all</div></div><hr />

Well Void Elves are still Blood Elves anyway so<br />

Tbh it aint that bad now if you dont take into account the legendaries wich wont even be a thing next expansion so yeah it became instantly more alt friendly by not having legendaries to grind.<br />
<br />
Ion said BfA will be the same level at Alt-friendliness as Legion.<br />
So, there will be something completely alt-unfriendly that will replace the Legiondaries.<br />
<br />
The fact there is a catchup mechanic for the Azerite is enough for this expac to be alt-unfriendly.

With no tier and ilvl = upgrade no matter what, does it matter at all? Gearing is not a thing anymore, you just upgrade your ilvl by 0.5 points, get 0.5% damage, and move on to the next boss. Thought-based decision making is not encouraged.</div></div><hr />

Well, they had the possibility to make the Azerite neck the same for all your specs (that's a damn neck), that would make sense (of course that couldn't have worked for Artifact weapons as they are designed).<br />
<br />
So yes, they still want us to farm like hell to keep alt-specs on par, that seems obvious to me.<br />
<br />
They even said the catch-up mechanics will be the same as Legion. And during Legion, catch-up mechanics arrived late, and the only one that was fine was the last one.</div></div><hr />

Warglaives, meanwhile, will likely go to the classes that can win them from Illidan (rogue, monk, warrior, death knight) in addition to demon hunters. This will be no more an issue than giving a rogue a 1h sword over a dagger.</div></div><hr />

Only since Legion and now BFA. Legion cut huge swaths out of characters and then put in inside an Artifact Weapon. That was taken away. Now it's being added back as Azerite gear. Only to be taken away yet again at the end of BFA. Legion didn't add any Talents. BFA won't add any Talents. We're going backwards instead of forwards. Shit like this didn't happen in MoP and earlier. Blizzard is slowly taking away core RPG elements while pushing RNG harder than ever.</div></div><hr />

All of the Allied Races are really just subraces, but in the case of all of them, they’ve been physiologically altered by outside forces, natural or cosmic/divine. Barring some kind of unreleased quest text saying they crossbred with the Drust or were subjected to a witchs’ curse, then the only thing that has affected Kul Tirans to be different than any other human is an over abundance or severe lack of food.</div></div><hr />

I understand it so, that BfA will start with catch-up mechanics, not add them over time. Like skipping Into-scenario or get worldquests unlocked accountwide from the start, if one character has done it. And that Azerite knowledge will start counting in the background as soon as you reach max-level.</div></div><hr />

Just make it simplier for everyone and get rid off secondary stats, but by doing that, (even the most stupid) people will realize how poor optimization is in this game so you don't do it but still make secondary stats irrelevant at the same time.<br />
<br />
At first, I was fan of the idea of personnal loot, might be fun and stuff. Then, I started doing pug to clean nm/hm and find that it really piss me off to loot 0-1 item when, at the same time, someone else loot 4-5 items. And this shit started to make me sick when i realized it happens, like, EVERY WEEK. So thanks you, no thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say maxing out your artifact now is completely 100% impossible and pointless. Level 49-50 of concordance on its own costs 200 trillion AP, and supposedly concordance doesn't even stop at 50 anymore and goes all the way to 100, but I feel that's because of the artifact instability that is supposed to happen someday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Looking back at Wrath and Cataclysm dev alphas. Warriors getting Titans grip? AWESOME! Shockwave? Omg so cool! Mages getting all those sweet new spells!<br />
<br />
Now it's like, every expansion we LOSE stuff! What gives? Why do they give us these cool things and then take them away? What's the point? Some classes got some cool, cool stuff from their artifacts and it's like &quot;enjoy it while you can, crybabies!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm going to miss Dimensional Rift, I'm going to miss the sweet play style of Legion Disc Priest. Why do they just take these things away from us?<br />
<br />
Disc is not changing much though, is it? The artifact traits are passive and you don't really care about them, the artifact ability is basically just another cooldown and legendaries don't matter much either. Only exciting thing about light's wrath was when you get the buff thingy and you crit with it for 10M. <br />
<br />
I was just about to pre-order the xpac and make a new toon. With the QA, I'll be reconsidering. Though with the way I plat the game outside of my progress raiding streaks, the changes they are making will allow me to really stay competitive...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way I see it, because they now save alot of resources on tier sets they use their art team to make useless allied races to dazzle simple people. These races are still not real content, because my character can only be one of them (unless I shill out 25 to 30 €) and besides some more fitting lore for some of my alts it simply doesn't do much for me. I atually hope blizzard refocuses soon in that regard, because their current direction won't lead them to where they think they're going.</div></div><hr />

It's undermining rewards where you actually have to play the game. Tell me, how rewarding does a World Quest feel that yields 100-200g when you can get 2,5k+ for clicking 3 times. In terms of gold rewards mission tables are the greatest income, which is WRONG! It should be the other way around, mission tables should yield 100-200g top and the harder World Quest that require groups should yield 2k+. Reputation are another spot where mission tables wins easily, you can get 2k reputation for a few simple clicks. Bad, fucking, design.</div></div><hr />

You have to keep in mind that it is blizzard who choose the questions they answer to. As such it is very easy to manipulate a Q&amp;A in order to say exactly what you want to and no more. If 10 players ask for information on the new raids and 1 on the new races, Blizzard can answer the question regarding the new races.</div></div><hr />

I really hope you understand the legitimate reason of why that was stated and addressed ...........something tells me you dont though. It's the fact that item level should be the reason to equip something, rather then the actual secondary stat value which is what they admitted was wrong in legion. The way things turned out, classes and specs became so reliant on certain secondary stats, because their value was incredible compared to shear item level increases. Obtaining a 960 or so item (stretching example depending) that is not an actual upgrade compared to a 910 or 915 neck because of the stats on it, is counterintuitive to say the least.</div></div><hr />

Yeah that's true! But have you seen the list of questions? I must say that probably 80% was about the races... Like nobody care about the content at all!</div></div><hr />

Wait, what?!. So i wont be able to lvl my zandalari troll the first day of BFA and i will have to wait for some weeks for a quest chain like suramar? I hope i am misunderstanding this and they are talking about only the intro quests of BFA as in no gated at all..<br />

It was said at the very least when we even started getting alpha information and announcements that Zandalar and dark iron would be unlocked when your character on that faction hit max level and did the story arcs(etc). This could have changed, but expecting to just play one right off is kind of silly honestly.</div></div><hr />

If they are going to make mythic+ competitive, they need to balance out these racials. Currently there's every reason in the world to switch to horde if you want to be really competitive, and zero reason to run as alliance.<br />
<br />
On a similar note, classes with huge utilitiy like heroism &amp; battle rez have a massive advantage over those without in mythic +. This also needs to be addressed. There's a reason most of the top teams in mythic+ competitive runs are using a lock, 1-2 druids, hunter, and self healing tanks like blood dks, dh, and bears. This needs to be addressed. I love the mythic+ system, and it's a lot of fun. But I feel unfairly penalized for playing something like a alliance ret pally with no AOE CC/brez/hero etc. At least if i was a blood elf i would have an aoe silence...</div></div><hr />

<br />
In order for something like that to happen they would have to move to b2p or even f2p model, having that much locked content and monthly sub model is a bit too much even for people that are hardcore addicts to wow. I cant say that i dont see it happen as i see cosmetic helms as a test for how much will WoWs community be interested in cosmetic items in shop, but i think it would be simply too much.<br />
<br />
Guild Wars 2, has a community sub base called &quot;fashion wars&quot;, name speaks for it self, i think that Blizzards &quot;Trial of Style&quot; is something like an attempt to bring something like that to WoW. However, GW2 is b2p model with optional ingame shop that offers mostly cosmetic stuff, but also some QoL stuff, character slots, character customization kits, dye packs and so on.. Taken in concern that legendary items in said game takes quite extensive time period to craft and that most of the items can be dyed however you like &quot;fashion wars&quot; has sense behind it.<br />
Guild Wars 2 does have episodic, seasonal content called &quot;Living Story&quot; that can be bought in shop if you missed it, however you could have unlocked it free of charge simply by just logging in while episode is active.<br />
So, game it self has a extremely lot to offer free of charge but it requires a lot of dedication invested in it, with some exclusive cosmetic options and QoL stuff that are optional to buy. You are not forced to buy it at all, its simply far too good to have, for instance, indestructible gathering tools, rather to have one broken in the middle of gathering.<br />
<br />
TL; DL: I think that WoW has well established business model which suites us all, players and Blizzard, for well over 11 years, there were some experiments (with cosmetic helmets for instance) but it would be far too much risky move to steer already hardly calm waters of community.<br />
<br />
With level scaling implemented i can see few boosters in the shop - exp boost, PvP exp and rep boosters. Or maybe even PvE only power and spell power boosters now that looms value/strength diminished quite decently.<br />
<br />
I can see that they are opening grounds for some new stuff, however having something that is not cosmetic exclusively only in the shop and no other way to get it would rise far too much of angry mob. Gotta remind you that we no longer have an insight in quarterly WoW's sub base as we used to, so i think that Blizz is not quite happy with numbers and they are building content/exploring ways to not only keep current community but also to draw new audience in. <br />

I dont think so. Blizz is trying to appeal to the &quot;fast paced, fun, skin centered&quot; type of players that are nowadays dominating the gaming scene. M+ is a perfect demonstration of that, from an mmorpg perspective that type of content was never a good thing (doing the same thing with slight changes) but the mmorpg part of wow has been systematically starved since wotlk-late bc, and i think that from an economic standpoint it's the right direction to go for blizz</div></div><hr />

Honestly the real problem with the old concept of raiding is the social perspective, the challenge/drop/balance thing is secondary. I think raiding and in a broader sense the &quot;hard work = great satisfaction&quot; type of content is really dead in this time and age.

Actually, the reason why raiding is dying is : <br />
<br />
1/ The design of the classes and battle system is more solo oriented than group oriented in their gameplay, as it used to be back in the pre wotlk era, <br />
2/ The relevant raids are designed with hard limitations related to the number of players required to complete them,<br />
3/ For mythic raiding, you actually need 20 people that have the same skill level.<br />
<br />
The combination of all these factors make raiding in wow an antisocial experience. Because due to the fact the gameplay is more and more solo oriented even in raid, 1) the swift completion of said raid is more based on the individual skill of the players rather than teamwork, and 2) as such, as the number of players in M raiding is hardcaped, you basically need to replace your underperfoming players to progress instead of allowing their skill level to grow while practicing (as it was the case in old MMORPG where raiding worked well, namely everquest, FFXI or wow vanilla, you could carry learning players in those games). <br />
<br />
It really isn't a problem with the players; The issue is with how the content is designed (and I m not even talking about the fact that due to the oversimplification of the battle system in modern MMORPG, the difficulty must lie elsewhere in the encounters)...<br />
<br />
In old mmorpg bringing more players to a raid wasn't a liability as it can be in the modern one, because back in the day you could give the key roles to a few key players who knew what they were doing and tell the new guys to make themselves useful by doing lesser tasks in the raid. It's something you cannot do in moderns MMO and the first raid in wow where things changed was during sunwell in TBC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I partly agree, but i have a couple of issues with your analysis. <br />
<br />
1/ The player hardcap is only relevant if it's a wall and not a natural transition, what i mean by this is that if player number is COMPLETELY irrelevant for 99% of the game and then suddenly an hardcap for M raiding it becomes much much more difficult to maintain a roster that can deal with the problems you pointed out.<br />
<br />
2/ The real problem i see with raids it's not refered to the HIGH END of the spectrum nor the low end. The harder punch was given to the middle of the pack kind of guild who got deprived of actual &quot;contractual power&quot; towards players. It's not blatantly obviuos but i strongly suspect that that was a really hard hit to the raiding scene. Mid of the pack guilds were the feeders for high end, and a sort of place were &quot;noobs&quot; can learn and decent players can get better before stepping up. The fact that nowadays guild matter ONLY for M raiding is a real issue (from a guild perspective). There is basically NO reason to form a guild except for M raids and so the high end of the spectrum slowly begins to lack replacement since they cant go in lfr and recruit people there. <br />
<br />
I suspect there is much more to the issue of the raids but it would make an umplesant wall of text that serves basically 0 purposes in this contex.<br />
Still we just need to recognize that &quot;Organized stable raiding guilds&quot; are a thing of the past for better or worse and move on</div></div><hr />

I disagree with almost everything you said. I don't see any evidence regarding class design being more solo oriented and raiders don't care about solo content anyways, most raiders are motivated to raid because they care achieving things that showcase that they are better than everyone else (achievements, raid mounts, mythic gear, server/world rankings). #2 and #3 have been true for most of the history of the game. Content design is likely relevant but developers have been good about listening to player feedback and designing raid content based on that feedback; the raid design/content has generally been considered to be of good quality by most of the playerbase for the last two expansions. <br />
<br />
I think it's simply due to player burnout. Younger gamers aren't flocking to the MMORPG genre and raiding is time-consuming, the game's core playerbase is aging and with children and work schedules raiding can be difficult to commit to.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crutos</div><div class="date">2018-03-17, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;They don't want to undo class pruning as much as wanting to add unique class abilities.&quot;<br />
&quot;Some classes don't necessarily need the abilities from their artifact weapons.&quot;<br />
&quot;Giving classes new abilities usually involves giving them something that they need, and after awhile it leads to everyone feeling the same.&quot; <br />
<br />
So the entire philosophy of class design in the current expansions is asking themselves &quot;what is actually NEEDED by the class/spec&quot;, instead of &quot;what differentiates this class'/specs playstyle/gameplay from the rest, and what makes it fun to play?&quot;? A skill or passive might add fun mechanics or changes to the core rotation but since that's fun and not a necessity for the class/spec to work/function, blizzard thinks it is good design to prune that away and only keep/add (but lets not fool ourselves into thinking they will actually add something new) what a class actually needs in order to be barely functional?<br />
<br />
That's is a glaring issue with current design, so because something is not on a need by need basis blizzard thinks it's redundant?<br />
What kind of lazy people are designing classes at blizzard? Did they think &quot;oh overwatch is very popular, lets apply the same design philosophy to classes in WoW!&quot;..<br />
When did FUN and INTERACTIVE get removed from the equation of class design? Where did complexity go?<br />
Why does blizzard think we want these horribly simplified classes that have maybe MAX a total of 18 abilities with 4/5th of them being really really situational 1m+ CDs that does something boring like increases your haste by X% for 5 seconds. <br />
Some of the more interesting ones are then giving much longer CDs because we shouldn't have fun too often right? Like Army of the Dead.. 10 min CD. No point in using this outside of raids or the occasional World PVP.<br />
<br />
The team wants to double down on strengths rather than emphasize weaknesses.<br />
<br />
So in a match-up between a ranged class with Mobility as a strength and a melee where mobility is not considered a strength it becomes a rock/paper/scissors game where you just lose as melee and win as ranged by default because you don't have the toolkit as melee in this scenario to actually outplay the &quot;strength&quot; of the other class.<br />
what ever happened to &quot;bring the player not the class&quot;. Oh right, blizzard just gave all classes everything, then decided it was a mistake because it homogenized classes, removed almost everything from some of the classes and gave others a ton. Like mages insane mobility, warlocks barely anything. without compensation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A: Ah, well. Well, green, it's something in the spectrum, it's something we look at and it's there, but it's not something we look at often.. *5 minutes later* and that's why green is alright.</div></div><hr />

I don't see any evidence regarding class design being more solo oriented and raiders don't care about solo content anyways, most raiders are motivated to raid because they care achieving things that showcase that they are better than everyone else (achievements, raid mounts, mythic gear, server/world rankings). #2 and #3 have been true for most of the history of the game. Content design is likely relevant but developers have been good about listening to player feedback and designing raid content based on that feedback; the raid design/content has generally been considered to be of good quality by most of the playerbase for the last two expansions. <br />
<br />
I think it's simply due to player burnout. Younger gamers aren't flocking to the MMORPG genre and raiding is time-consuming, the game's core playerbase is aging and with children and work schedules raiding can be difficult to commit to.<br />
<br />
Classes are solo oriented because most of what you re doing in raid is micromanaging your output while handling the boss abilities (that are mostly positional based nowadays) in order to maximize said output.<br />
<br />
In no way your gameplay is oriented toward your group as it used to be when raiding was at its best and everybody wanted to raid. As an example, as dps, you never think about not pulling aggro of the tank nowaday.<br />
<br />
While wow has always been more solo oriented than older mmo, most of what made wow a team based game during vanilla and tbc in its battle system has been pruned out over the years. Thus making raid some sort of underwhelming afterthought for nostalgics (Argus is a good exemple of underwhelming raid encounter, but it is so due to the limitations of the battle system that isn t deep enough anymore).</div></div><hr />

They could focus on actual content like heritage armor for current races. I feel as if the whole class tuning is just there as filler. Something for Ion to throw in there for an excuse slack off without doing any actual work. You can already tell that the devs are treating the game as if its an old worn out truck that only has a few miles left on it. Ion seems like hes waiting for something to open up just so he can leave.</div></div><hr />

Art team is plenty busy every expansion, and trust me, it's not redesigning classes, you wouldn't want them doing that. Instead it's, you know, making all the new art assets that com with ANY expansion.</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling that other players might disagree on your definition of &quot;actual content&quot;, myself included.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Venivici</div><div class="date">2018-03-19, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personal loot is a terrible idea. Guilds will just take all the loot and redistribute it via loot council. Blizzard can ofc curb this by not making loot tradable, but this also is s terrible idea, because then you might wind up getting 5 rings or multiples of stuff you already have. It's gonna backfire bad.<br />
<br />
I agree that having only personal loot is a terrible Idea. Individuals joining a guild raid team are agreeing that loot shall be distributed in a fashion that benefits the group and not solely the individual. It is understood by many raiders that joining a guild raid team is to adopt their loot rules. Master looter allows consideration of performance, readiness, attendance, viability of gear for a specific class, etc. with the consent of the group.</div></div><hr />

If only they actually practiced what they preach. Fists of Fury stun is mandatory as can be for WW monks in PvP yet it's not made base line. So many things that were mandatory in Legion haven't been made base line.</div></div><hr />

When blizzard makes a statement you have to look at it in its extremely literal meaning. It technically 'could' but it wont.</div></div><hr />

That's the entire point of removing Master Loot. A guild just starting out on BFA raids can just funnel all the loot to the RL and do LC/any other method. <br />
<br />
The interview specifically mentions that they're targeting split runs and other loot funneling methods.<br />
<br />
Cool, so a loot system perfect for slowing down a small % of raiding guilds, but us average Joes who are still working through Mythic raid, long after the world 1st/realm 1st challengers have stopped and unsubbed (if they even pay a sub), we're getting shat on when it comes to loot. Loot is already a delicate subject in raiding. Can't wait for the shit storm to start.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RWJ</div><div class="date">2018-03-21, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mythic 20 killed many guilds. As a player who has always raided at the highest difficulty, Mythic 20 was the beginning of the end of my top-end raiding experience. It is simply too much work to keep a roster of 25 skilled people and as a result, guilds fall apart. Me and many of my fellow guildies decided to go &quot;casual&quot; for Legion. Not because we didn't want to raid Mythic, but because it was too much roster work. If Mythic 10 was an option, we would do it in a heartbeat. That is my request to the Dev team, please add Mythic 10 to the game!!<br />
<br />
And I'm sure Blizzard can find many ways to incentive Mythic 20 over Mythic 10... (gear, mounts, achievements). I just want to raid Mythic 10!</div></div><hr />
