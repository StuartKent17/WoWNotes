Siege of Orgrimmar Heroic Progression<br />
Blood Legion (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/illidan/Blood+Legion/rating.tier16_25) is leading progress tonight, with 9/14 bosses down. Midwinter (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/sargeras/Midwinter/rating.tier16_25) and Duality (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/zul-jin/Duality/rating.tier16_25) are close behind, closing a gap from earlier in the night at 8/14 bosses. Over in the 10 player column, Avast (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/us/frostmourne/Avast/rating.tier16_10) is currently leading with 5/14 bosses down.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that EU progression has not started yet, as realms are currently still down for the Wednesday maintenance. <br />

<br />
Conquest Vendors Temporarily Disabled<br />
We are aware of an issue affecting a number of players that caused them to have an unusually high Conquest Point cap. Conquest vendors have been temporarily disabled while we work on a fix to correct this. Conquest Points obtained in excess of the 2200 point cap will be lost and we'll be removing the Grievous Conquest achievement from any characters that managed to obtain it.<br />
<br />
The vendors will be made available again once the fix is in place.<br />

Feldrake as a Ground Mount<br />
The Feldrake (http://www.wowdb.com/items/79771-feldrake) having ground mount functionality was originally a bug. When the bug got fixed for all drakes, that functionality got removed.

I know this might seem shocking, but could it be possible that the people doing heroic progression partly does it because they love it, and not to be famous? They will surely remember their personal achievement, even though Joe sixpack and other people might not.</div></div><hr />

This. Was looking forward to Heroics after normal modes were easier than walking in a straight line but 9/14HC in 1 single night? That's a complete joke. On an upside, it means I should have alot of free time this Winter to sort my new job out ^-^</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only joke is the difficulty of the content. I'm pretty sure Blizzard made Flex about as hard as old LFR. New normal mode is what Flex SHOULD have been. The first 4 bosses in heroic are laughably easy, and the rest don't seem to be much harder. I guess when you balance around the lowest common denominator, you wind up with bad content. If you struggle against Skyrim on the hardest difficulty, you'd probably struggle on heroic. If you have no problems beating Skyrim on the highest difficult, you're more than capable of having heroic content cleared this month. Yes, it is that easy.</div></div><hr />

you havent been in the game for some time it seems, 4-5 months if you play 1 hour a week to be realistic :P i dont think youre the target audience for pve endgame sort to speak either since the last patch cycle of the 4th expansion is when you choose not to buy the game. <br />
<br />
US realms have been up for abit, and ToT progression was similar :) first 7 went down fairly quickly and even on the very same day. The opening is always like this, even blizzard said they wanted to difficulty to scale up as you get further in and the paragons siegcrafter and garrosh himself is where the race will stand.</div></div><hr />

and yet people will whine they have nothing to do, because they cleared everything already, this just bad blizzard design with thuderforged\warforged and upgrades, which making content already nerfed when it's coming...1 mounth lots of ppl will clear it hc and then other 6-8 mounth untill next expansion what the hell they gonna do, even 5.5 won't bring anything for them...</div></div><hr />

To be fair theres already people that did clear at least 6/14 complaining how easy it is.<br />
<br />
Also it's fairly obvious to non hardcore raiders that this tier must be easy when 9 bosses are already dead within hours. I don't think theres been any other tier cleared this fast has there?</div></div><hr />

So out of touch it's funny.<br />
<br />
If you kill a single boss on normal. Congrats, your part of a minority of the player base that never will.<br />
<br />
If you kill a single boss on heroic. Congrats, your part of a very small minority player base.<br />
<br />
Acting as if the fact a very very small amount of players have cleared up to nine bosses on heroic mode this quick is insane. World of Warcraft is played by over seven million players. 25 of which have beaten 9 bosses on heroic. Think about that for a moment, that's a very very small percent of players doing so. The amount of players that ever kill 9 bosses in heroic will no doubt be less then 1 percent of the players. How can anyone with any sense say that in a game of 7 million players, less then 200k of them beating any heroic boss shows how it is not difficult. <br />
<br />
If the game was being balanced around the lowest common denominator you would have a whole lot more people beating normal much less heroic.</div></div><hr />

These people were playing with friends, talking on Teamspeak etc. Socializing online doesn't mean someone has no life, just means they prefer to do it that way. I play a lot of WoW, I have a girlfriend, I do a lot of travelling, I keep fit by cycling 100+ miles at weekends, but I but time aside in the past to raid and I seem to recall it was around 6 hours on some raid nights. My other half prefered me to do that than go out getting pissed. Yeah I suspect that some players of WoW just stay indoors but that's their choice and you have no right to critisize anyone. Go away sugarplum.</div></div><hr />

Explain, no... enlighten us, please... how do people, in this very example have &quot;no real life&quot; when they are able to down 10 heroic bosses in a time span of 12 hours, compared to the average rank 500 guild which'll probably need 20hrs per boss each?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the 'no life' thing can be taken here in the sense that there's a difference between killing bosses gradually overtime, little by little every day than getting into the game 1st thing and work on bosses non stop until they die on a working day of the week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually he is probably 100% wrong.<br />
What happens here is the high end progression guilds, usually, are sponsored by some gaming gear company, and this kind of thing, like 1st in progression, means more money/gear for the team, once they beat everyone else, and stand at the top of the world. Even prizes in money are rewarded for those teams.<br />
This used to happen with Paragon, and other guilds back in time, and I'm pretty sure this didn't changed.<br />
<br />
The sad part about this progression is that the content of the patch will get old in a few weeks after the release, and everyone should reminds one thing, we will not have another big patch till next expasion, so enjoy 5~6 months of content farm...I don't know if everyone will agree, but this isn't nice, that is depressing...<br />

Q. How do I achieve a World First?<br />
A. Play in the USA, get a 36 hours headstart.<br />
<br />
Not really, if you live in Europe, or any place where the content have a delay for release, this is counted on world 1st ranks.<br />
The 1st is the team who killed it in less time, counting of the release on that location, not based on who killed it first.<br />
If your afirmation was true, Paragon, and many others, would never lead the ranks of world 1st for so many time, since they used to play in europe.</div></div><hr />

This. The bleeding edge always gobbled up content at a ridiculous pace. The fact the PTR is so easily available to them means they spend no time at all practicing these fights - often with a lower item level then their real characters actually have! Thus they blast through it. No suprises there.<br />
<br />
The rest of us? Yeah, we're going to struggle. A lot. The people complaining at NOT the ones actually doing the things they are complaining about (and often don't even raid or play WoW).<br />

Have you figured that is, for most of the top raiding guilds, their jobs? They don't have to set aside social life, or anything else. That is not for fun, that is how they work, is how they get their money. That is why these guys spend hours and hours, wiping with every guild member in PTR, in one fight, to let everyone get ready when this goes live...<br />
If you receive money to do that, you wouldn't spend 12 hours per day (during at least the last 2 months), just learning a fight?</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure Blizzard made Flex about as hard as old LFR. New normal mode is what Flex SHOULD have been. The first 4 bosses in heroic are laughably easy, and the rest don't seem to be much harder. I guess when you balance around the lowest common denominator, you wind up with bad content. If you struggle against Skyrim on the hardest difficulty, you'd probably struggle on heroic. If you have no problems beating Skyrim on the highest difficult, you're more than capable of having heroic content cleared this month. Yes, it is that easy.<br />
<br />
Stop the damn complaining, if they'd balance the content for those 20 guilds who raid 24/7 it would be an economical suicide, it's simple as that, those guilds are not the de-facto standard of this game, they are an anomaly, there's 500 mediocre guilds to 1 hardcore guild, realize that and then understand why they can't make the raids as hard as hell may it be LFR/FLEX/Normal or Heroic.</div></div><hr />

Blood Legion took 2 days to get to 6/12 HC in ToT iirc. Even if you were to try to extrapolate that to other guilds, you'll have the top ~300 clearing this content within 2 lockouts depending on their level of preparedness. That's a large amount of the progression player base clearing a large portion of content. I guess I'll pvp for 5 months after HC Garrosh? Maybe Final Fantasy...</div></div><hr />

I just don´t get this. The tuning of raids is much better now. The vast majority of guilds will progress through normals and heroics over the next 6 months. There were a TON, in fact MOST people who got into heroic raids in TOT never finished it before SoO was released. That is clear and smooth, and difficult progression.<br />
<br />
Watching these guilds this week.. it is kinda like watching the slam dunk contest at the NBA all star game.. It is a special strange event that happens briefly, but should not be extrapolated at all into what ´raiding´ actually will be like this tier. This entire expansion, there has not been a huge increase in the number of people clearing heroics despite the fact that the famous guilds have gotten faster at doing them the first week. These guilds have hundreds of attempts on the PTR, it just makes it impossible to compare to normal raiding guilds.<br />
