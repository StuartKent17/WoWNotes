It sure was and towards the end of the expansion it was &quot;what level is your lego ring? pfft only XXX get lost loser!&quot; so tell me again why repeating the same mistakes is a good thing. I have 10 alts that I enjoy playing but don't enjoy grinding out levels of a ring on. In wod at the end none of them could get into heroic hellfire citadeal because they either didn't have their ring or it wasn't up to snuff.<br />
<br />
I think that your alts ring's should all level up with your mains ring if they want to do this, additionally there should be a weekly passive power increase to your ring so if you stop playing you're ring isn't complete garbage when you come back. People will exclude players because of this we've seen it proven time and time again, let's not add another discouragement for players to return to the game.</div></div><hr />

That looks like the most reasonable explanation. But if that's really the case, that means that you'll likely have at least 1 legendary for each kill, as regular drops. So, why don't they just keep them purple ? Legendaries as regular drop just doesn't make sense... Will oranges become the new purples, after purples already erased the point of blues ?</div></div><hr />

Articulate - intelligent - constructive - and well thought out post sir ... bravo. No doubt you'll receive a personal reply from Blizz asking you for more input to help them with future game design. An example for the rest of us to follow. Ty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renuts</div><div class="date">2017-10-11, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nerfing the Tanking trinket &quot;Aggramar's Conviction&quot; from providing Armor to now providing Versatility makes it comparably mediocre to most of the other much stronger trinkets. No tank worth his salt is going to use that over any of the other existing Armor trinkets, or even stat sticks, unless he has to.<br />
<br />
The Empowerment Proc would be good if you could actually choose when to use it! The fact that it is random, and it is also dependent upon several other members of your group just makes it absurdly stupid. It's a Battlemaster trinket that heals you to full as a proc? Woopty f***ing do... It's honestly incredible how incompetent the Devs can be. Thankfully we actually have a lot of options for trinkets, otherwise we would be stuck with whatever garbage the Devs thought us tanks deserved each new tier..<br />
<br />
The Blizzard Devs have consistently made Tanking trinkets comparably $%^&amp;ty to the DPS and Healing counterparts. It's so freaking annoying seeing them constantly f*** up and nerf anything that looks even remotely good or interesting for a Tank. I honestly think that the only reason the currently superior Armor trinkets are even available in game, is because the Dev's don't understand how good they actually are.<br />
<br />
You want to make an End-Tier trinket that stands out from the rest, and actually rewards your accomplishment of taking down the end of the expansion Raid Boss? Give Tanks a trinket with Stamina, Strength, and Armor on it..... There you go, this is a trinket that is strong for both Physical and Magical damage, and it also boosts our DPS a bit by having Strength. Of course we all know you aren't going to do that. So if you could at least make the Empowerment proc something that actually makes sense to be a proc, that would be a good start.<br />
<br />
For crying out loud! it's supposed to be the Final Raid Tier..... the Final Raid Boss of the Legion expansion, and you are just giving us another mediocre trinket to add to the rest of them? What is wrong with actually giving people strong items at the end of the expansion! There shouldn't be any chance that any loot of an equal ilvl dropped from Argus the Unmaker isn't an upgrade. Idiots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
huh? they didn't do the stat squish because of the item level of items, but the stats (big f***ing numbers) they had. It would make no difference the iteml evel increasing by increments of one instead of five, if the changes just ended up being exponential either way...<br />

<br />
I kinda see your point, but keep in mind, that if you account for empowered proc, it will be a huge upgrade. Maybe not for you personally ( :S ), but for the raid. Without you having the trinket, the DDs and healers never get a proc either... Just keep it as a third (fourth, etc...) trinket to swap to when needed, and use a better itemised one for smaller groups, mythics, wq, whatever.<br />
I really liked the way the WoD rings worked, should be a use instead of a proc effect. Small groups are more or less screwed this way, and there's content it doesn't even work at all in.</div></div><hr />
