World of Warcraft Cataclysm Press Tour<br />
Earlier this week, general gaming sites and a couple of official fansites were invited to the Blizzard HQ for a press tour of Cataclysm. The NDA (on the press tour, don't get too excited) just lifted and a couple of information have been revealed.<br />
<br />
This post will probably be updated multiple times during the night, so far this is what I gathered before the NDA lift: <br />
<br />
Path of the Titans is gone<br />
The whole Path of the Titans idea has been removed from the game. It will no longer rely on Archeology or on any kind of PvE/PvP progression and instead Blizzard will just introduce a new type of glyphs: Medium Glyphs. <br />
<br />
Medium Glyphs will add a &quot;fun factor&quot; to abilities, and it wouldn't be surprising to see something similar to the Fortification (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/august/gamesystems_029.jpg) or Breakthrough (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/august/gamesystems_030.jpg) glyphs first previewed during Blizzcon 2009. (But probably not these exact glyphs, a lot of stuff happened since last year)<br />
<br />
Guild Talents are gone<br />
The guild talents are gone and your guild now gets extra bonuses depending on its level. There are 25 levels and each level will automatically reward with more cool stuff. The leveling process remains unchanged and your guild will gain experience through PvP, Dungeon and Raid progression, questing, etc ...<br />
<br />
Guild currency has also been removed and rewards will just be &quot;unlocked&quot; after you reach a specific level or complete a guild achievement. Once a reward is unlocked, members will be able to purchase it with gold. Some of the rewards include guild tabards, mounts, heirlooms, and it looks like you will finally be able to have a guild tabard on your mount. (Just like the Argent Tournament banners)<br />
<br />
New members of a guild won't be able to buy everything directly, they will have to contribute to the progression of the guild before they can access the top rewards. Each time a player helps towards the leveling he will gain reputation with the guild, the best rewards will require players to be exalted with their guild before they can buy it. <br />
<br />
Archeology will be less important<br />
With the Path of the Titans gone, Archeology will become a &quot;true&quot; secondary profession and you won't really have to level it anymore. However it will still be used to let you get cosmetic/optional items, get more information on the game's lore, and ultimately it looks like we can expect rewards similar to fishing. (Nothing mandatory, but you'll be happy when you actually find something)<br />
<br />
Information gathered from other sites:<br />
You will find two types of items: Common Artifacts will give you more information on the lore of a race, and might be used in some kind of collection game. Rare items will give you usable items, most of them will be cosmetic but some of them will have actual effects. (Details on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159674))<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons Split<br />
Raid leaders will be able to split an ongoing 25-man raid into up to three 10-man raids. Those 10-man raids will be able to continue from that point on, with bosses already down.<br />
<br />
So far it looks like it won't be possible to merge 10-man raids into 25-man raids, for obvious reasons. <br />
<br />
Information gathered from other sites:<br />
Raid IDs should be much more flexible. You will be able to join any raid as long as it doesn't have any bosses up that you have already killed. (Details on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159674))<br />
There will be more Algalon-style encounters&#8212;ultra-hard optional bosses for hardcore players only. (Details on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159674))<br />
<br />
Rated Battlegrounds<br />
Rated battlegrounds will be available for pre-mades of 10, 15 and 25-player sizes. The amount of Conquest points rewarded will be capped so that players who enjoy both arenas and rated battlegrounds don't feel they have to prioritize one over the other.<br />
<br />
Information gathered from other sites:<br />
The classic Honor titles will be coming back and rewarded to the top teams each season. (Details on WoR (http://www.worldofraids.com/))<br />
The &quot;Gladiator&quot; equivalent teams will also receive epic ground mounts. Ground mounts because they want to reward something you can ride in the battleground and be proud of / show off. (Details on WoR (http://www.worldofraids.com/))<br />
<br />
Grim Batol Raid<br />
The Grim Batol raid instance will be called the Bastion of Twilight, and you get to fight Cho'gall as the end boss! If you manage to defeat him in Heroic Mode, an &quot;horrific secret will be revealed when he dies&quot;.<br />
<br />
Information gathered from other sites:<br />
This is an entry-level raid, just like Naxxramas in WotLK. (Details on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159674))<br />
It will feature 5 bosses, and an Algalon-style optional and ultra-hard boss. (The &quot;horrific&quot; secret?) (Details on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159674))<br />
<br />
Skywall Raid<br />
As expected, Al'akir (http://www.wowwiki.com/Al%27Akir) will be the end boss of the Skywall raid instance.<br />
<br />
Information gathered from other sites:<br />
Bosses will include a djinn, a storm dragon, and a lesser elemental lord. (Details on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159674))<br />
You will be able to use regular flying mounts to fly from platform to platform. (Details on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159674))<br />
It looks really good. Really. (Details on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159674))<br />
<br />
Deepholm<br />
Princess Therazane (yes, that's her (http://www.wowwiki.com/Therazane)) will be a questgiver in Deepholm, in a similar experience to the Sons of Hodir's questline in Storm Peaks.<br />
<br />
Information gathered from other sites:<br />
The Ogrim's Hammer has crashed in the zone and the Skybreaker is still in the air. One of the questline will require you to find out what happened. (Details on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159674))<br />
<br />
Heroic Deadmines / Shadowfang Keep<br />
Heroic versions of classic instances might not be ready for the release of Cataclysm and will be shipped in content patch instead. <br />
<br />
Old world changes<br />
There are a more details on old world changes, especially capital cities.<br />
<br />
Information gathered from other sites:<br />
Stormwind has been completely redesigned to accomodate flying mounts. The Park of Stormwind has been destroyed by Deathwing and the Dwarven District now hosts a Bank and an Auction House. (Details on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159674))<br />
Orgrimmar has been redesigned as well: Garrosh is the new Warchief and is located in the center of Orgrimmar, not in the Valley of Wisdom. Goblins have their own area, the Valley of Wisdom becomes a Tauren district, and there is now a back gate leading directly into Azshara. (Details on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159674))<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous Changes/Information<br />
Wrath of the Lich King had 1000 Quests, Cataclysm has over 3000.<br />
The current heirlooms will stop growing after level 80. There will be a whole new crop of heirlooms for Cataclysm. Goblins and Worgen will be able to start using heirlooms immediately at launch. (Details on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159674))<br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Zone Changes<br />
A new video of zone changes in Cataclysm was released. Stole this one from Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/blog=159663).<br />

Not so pleased with the hrc Deadmines and SFK delay though. But oh well.<br />
<br />
The guild rep is a good idea. Then maybe people will bother signing up for raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting stuff with Path of the Titans gone and Guild Talents gone. I was a bit worried about the &quot;over-required&quot; nature of Archeology, so I'm glad it's taking a back seat, though I'll be indulging in it VERY frequently!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cannibalghoul</div><div class="date">2010-06-13, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is disappointing, path of the titans looked cool</div></div><hr />

Removing guild talents makes good sense too as they have much better control over the bonuses a guild gets by just giving straight bonuses per level.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoca322092fb4</div><div class="date">2010-06-13, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PotT has been praised as the big feature for advancing characters after you've hit 85. The accompanying archaelogy is now just a &quot;fun&quot; profession. That sounds like some of the best features have been dumped, and we're back to good ol' instance grinding. Too complex? I dunno. Maybe the true answer is: Sorry, but we're running out of time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Agarash</div><div class="date">2010-06-13, 07:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, they start removing things...<br />
Path of the Titans was one of the most interesting things about Cataclysm and they remove it...and replace it with medium glyphs, oh the fun!<br />
Guild talents too, would have been interesting to be able to personalize the guild but no, now what we've got? Just another faction to mindlessly grind...oh the fun!<br />
Also now Archaeology will be for cosmetic stuff...again oh the fun!<br />
At least we still have heroic Deadmines and SFK...oh wait...<br />
This is evolving into another &quot;more of the same&quot; expansion, won't be surprised by other cuts along the way till release...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zebramints</div><div class="date">2010-06-13, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">thanks blizz, you dangle cool shit in front of us and take it away...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. Maybe they just realized that, with trying to fit all of this new stuff in, it would take them far too long to implement it all.<br />
I'm still pretty disappointed by it, Path of the Titans sounded interesting (if not a bit confusing at first), and the Guild Leveling system, I hope, is still mostly intact, just reworked.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alymae</div><div class="date">2010-06-13, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aww c'mon, I was so interested in the progression of path of the titans :o<br />

Also this is my first time checking MMO-Champ looks since transfer and tbh I'd prefer the old look, however this isnt bad either :3</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cernunnos</div><div class="date">2010-06-13, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess removing the tree aspect of guild leveling isnt so bad if the talents you would spec into are just given to you each level. Which it sort of sounds like they are going to be now.<br />
<br />
Instead of pointing points into &quot;Reduced repair bills&quot; at level 2, we just get &quot;Reduced repair bills&quot; at level 2. makes it less complicated I guess.<br />
<br />
Reputation with guild. sounds fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Path of the titans while cool, kinda did seem like it was just an extra page of glyphs. combining the two and having minor medium and major glyphs seems the easier thing to do as well.</div></div><hr />

The Grim Batol raid instance will be called the Bastion of Twilight, and you get to fight Cho'gall as the end boss! If you manage to defeat him in Heroic Mode, a &quot;horrific secret will be revealed when he dies&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Path of the Titans, a really cool idea - gone.<br />
Guild Talents - gone. Now every guild will be the same, no way to &quot;specialize&quot;.<br />
Guild currency - gone.<br />
But now we can grind reputation with our own guild.... uhm.... wtf? Do we really need yet another faction grind? I really hope you get reputation for basically doing anything while in the guild, levelling, raiding, dungeons etc.<br />
<br />
Uhm.... Deathwing enters through the Maelstrom now? what the ... Ok, if they do it well I might buy it, still... doing a retcon, sort of, already?! Seriously, make up your minds before announcing one thing to the world and then doing another thing. <br />
Now that DW enters through the Maelstrom we better be able to go there to seal it or something. Being able to go to, to see the Maelstrom would be a major, major bonus for me and would make me overlook the Path of the Titans thing etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
What I like:<br />
<br />
The emphasis on &quot;acting&quot; warchief. ^^ The story leak at Spooncraft already convinced me that there's a good chance that Garrosh won't stay Warchief, or if he really changes might stay Warchief (a better person then though) or after Cataclysm go back to being Thrall's number one, having earned the right to be his heir (which doesn't seem to be true right now, what we've seen of what he does in Cataclysm).<br />
<br />
Really like the &quot;joining other IDs&quot; thing. We're doing a 10man in our guild and couple other guys from the 25man also a 10man. Often, on the second day of raiding where everyone already has an ID, either they or we have not enough players to continue while the other raid often has a surplus of players. This way we could simply switch players to fill up both. Very nice.<br />
<br />
New music - major bonus imo. I really, really liked the Wotlk music, much, much more than the Vanilla or BC stuff. If they add Wotlk-quality music to the new Vanilla content - hell yeah!</div></div><hr />

<br />
So anyway. I'm a little bummed that Path is gone, but I can see where it could've gotten a bit to complicated to manage, particularly with PvE AND PvP.<br />
<br />
I think that the guild talents change is good. It would be kinda lame if the talent system didn't let you pick up all of the talents, and if it did let you pick them all up, then what's the point of letting the players choose the order.<br />
<br />
I'm a little concerned about the &quot;reputation&quot;, though. What if you join a guild that's already level 25? Will the standard methods of contribution still advance your reputation? I would imagine so, but I'm still concerned.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wych</div><div class="date">2010-06-13, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am gutted about PotT going, seemed a really unique and interesting feature which would add some much needed customisation to a game where at times seems to be very &quot;cookie cutter&quot; (lots of people going round in the same looking gear, with the same spec, same glyphs, same pets etc) although if it was going to delay the game immensely to balance this feature I can see why they did it, and everybody scouring the world for relics for the first 2 months to try and be ready for raiding would not be great...<br />
<br />
I am happy about Guild Talents though, especially when levelling (well with all my characters right now) they are in random guilds and I wouldn't particularly trust the leader to spec the guild properly so the levelling thing sounds better.<br />
<br />
Dissapointed in the delay of SFK and DM delays, I wanted to see how something played out which I won't discuss or even mention until it's confirmed the FULL NDA is lifted. Surely they wouldn't take too much work?<br />
<br />
Cho'gall thing has me really interested and i can see a major twist in the lore hopefully, although I hope it's not just (I FUSED WITH C'THUN LOLZ/C'THUN IS STILL ALIVE GETTING STRONGER YOU KILLED AN IMAGINATION OF HIM HE MADE U CRAZYYY IN NEXT CONTENT PATCH YOU FIGHT HIM).<br />
<br />
All in all I see it as quite interesting, it seems like they are trying to push the game forward as much as possible, maybe with PotT etc they would be struggling for a release before Blizzcon (or even Christmas) which they hinted at last year (&quot;You will be complaining about Goblin Rogues by the time blizzcon comes round again).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the removal of guild talents is a good thing. That sounded overly-complicated. I hope thew rewards are fun.<br />
<br />
Will &quot;medium glyphs&quot; be something scribes craft, you think?<br />
<br />
However, the removal of Path of the Titans is crappy. How will our characters advance at 85? Same old boring gearing? Just five more levels, without path of the titans to provide endgame enhancement, sounds crap. I hope the devs spend some time tomorrow answering why it was removed.</div></div><hr />

The guild bonuses are not gone, just the talents. You'll still get all those awesome bonuses that you'd otherwise have gotten through talents, but instead you don't have to gather any currency to spend on them, they become available automatically once your guild dings.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm a little disappointed in the Path of the Titans removal, I was reaally looking forward to it, but to be honest, it was insanely complicated, and made a secondary profession mandatory, which isn't what those are for.<br />
<br />
I think the Medium Glyphs sounds like fun. I can't wait to see Cho'gall in heroic mode, though I doubt my guild will have time to down him before the next content patch... Bah, I might actually have to sneak peak since it's only from heroic mode.</div></div><hr />

or this:<br />
<br />
Heroic Deadmines / Shadowfang Keep - Must be so hard to just use old content maybe you should get more practice with it....it shouldnt be that difficuilt you could always just remove all mobs then add new level 85's in their places rather than tweaking the current ones....seems like blizzard just wanted some extra content in future patches and rather than actually providing future content they decided just to withhold on sfk and deadmines....</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping that they work it so there are fewer pug raids asking for ridiculous GS numbers and people actually form or join Guilds so they can progress in raids more.<br />
One of the things I hated most about WotLK was being able to purchase Tier items with badges, imo it diminished the need for a guild and is what helped make pugs get so out of control to this date.</div></div><hr />

Warcraft Adventures and Starcraft: Ghost (along several other Blizz's IPs that never saw the daylight) says hi.<br />

It has nothing to do with Activision, Blizz has a long tradition of scrapping half-good and somewhat-finished projects when they think it's not good enough. They have HUGE high standards. And for the looks of it, Path of Titans was getting complicated to figure out and guild talents would bring nothing but guild drama.</div></div><hr />

Also now Archaeology will be for cosmetic stuff...again oh the fun!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbr</div><div class="date">2010-06-13, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Path of the Titans is gone<br />
The whole Path of the Titans idea has been removed from the game. It will no longer rely on Archeology or on any kind of PvE/PvP progression and instead Blizzard will just introduce a new type of glyphs: Medium Glyphs.<br />
<br />
Medium Glyphs will add a &quot;fun factor&quot; to abilities, and it wouldn't be surprising to see something similar to the Fortification or Breakthrough glyphs first previewed during Blizzcon 2009. (But probably not these exact glyphs, a lot of stuff happened since last year)<br />
<br />
Guild Talents are gone<br />
The guild talents are gone and your guild now gets extra bonuses depending on its level. There are 25 levels and each level will automatically reward with more cool stuff. The leveling process remains unchanged and your guild will gain experience through PvP, Dungeon and Raid progression, questing, etc ...<br />
<br />
Guild currency has also been removed and rewards will just be &quot;unlocked&quot; after you reach a specific level or complete a guild achievement. Once a reward is unlocked, members will be able to purchase it with gold. Some of the rewards include guild tabards, mounts, heirlooms, and it looks like you will finally be able to have a guild tabard on your mount. (Just like the Argent Tournament banners)<br />
<br />
New members of a guild won't be able to buy everything directly, they will have to contribute to the progression of the guild before they can access the top rewards. Each time a player helps towards the leveling he will gain reputation with the guild, the best rewards will require players to be exalted with their guild before they can buy it.<br />
<br />
Archeology will be less important<br />
With the Path of the Titans gone, Archeology will become a &quot;true&quot; secondary profession and you won't really have to level it anymore. However it will still be used to let you get cosmetic/optional items, get more information on the game's lore, and ultimately it looks like we can expect rewards similar to fishing. (Nothing mandatory, but you'll be happy when you actually find something)<br />
<br />
Information gathered from other sites:[list] You will find two types of items: Common Artifacts will give you more information on the lore of a race, and might be used in some kind of collection game. Rare items will give you usable items, most of them will be cosmetic but some of them will have actual effects. (Details on Wowhead)<br />
<br />
Kind of lame, I was rather looking forward to the path and archeaology.<br />
<br />
If they put arch on the same level as fishing and cooking, that's still fine though.<br />
<br />
But... RIP guild talents,, those were cool.<br />

Weren't we just told it would be part of cataclysm? Things get put in throughout the expansion in content patches, why are people so surprised by this? &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
Also loving the changes, PotT's from the little info we had about it, sounded confusing, and probably a must have for all characters, so very grindy in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Guild talents, I think would just cause guild drama, and heck we don't need anymore of that, so I'm thinking this was a change for the best.<br />
<br />
And I definitely agree that Inscription just didn't cut it when they introduced it in WotLK. Just never felt like a finished Profession to me. So perhaps the &quot;fun&quot; Medium Glyphs will go towards making this a proffession that will seem worthwhile.<br />
<br />
All good!<br />

Medium glyphs. Wonder if Kotick came up with that one himself?<br />

Would have preferred it if Blizzard stopped removing anything from the game (past or future) that meant players had to think about anything. This better be one breathtaking expansion if they want players (myself included) to continue playing.<br />

At least they aren't trying to sugar coat it with a &quot;don't worry, we will definitely get it later&quot;. Hate being lead on. But still, these things were a great spice to look forward to in Cataclsym. Without them, it just makes things taste more bland.<br />

None of the scrapping makes it come sooner, especially when the features were already half done.<br />

<br />
Guild talents, meh, since I'm no guild master I don't really care, changing it to abilities gained via leveling up the guild is basically the same for myself. Besides, as they mentioned, guilds will all use the same cookie-cutter builds like players do with talents, so it wouldn't really matter.<br />
<br />
Time will tell though, time will tell.<br />
<br />
PS: everyone that is bitching about &quot;Dammit! Bliz shouldn't announce something they aren't going to add!!&quot;, take note that the reason they try and hold shit back is because people bitch about it too much, and in the end, we all have to wait longer for information.<br />
<br />
Just remember that in an alpha/beta, things change, a lot, so don't get hooked on something too much, else it might disappoint you for what it may become on release. (Or get you even more excited!)<br />

Guild Talents are gone - Too chaotic to balance these and keep them as 'fun' rather than all guilds requiring a certain spec to be effective I guess<br />
Archeology less important - It would've needed to be a primary profession rather than secondary with it's connection to Path of the Titans, so makes sense<br />
<br />
Raid &amp; Dungeon split - shame there isn't a way to combine raids as well, but at least they can be split now<br />
Rated Battlegrounds - at least we get to keep 1 new feature they said would be in the expansion :)<br />
Grim Batol Raid - erm... why is Cho'gall in Grim Batol? Wasn't it previously run by Orcs and Dwarves?<br />
Skywall Raid - was kind of a given that Al'Akir would be the final boss<br />
Deepholm - Personally I was looking forward to killing Princess Therazane... :(<br />
Heroic Deadmines / Shadowfang - Bah! :(<br />
Old world changes - Thunderbluff still seems like a much easier target to raid so I hope that changes<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous changes - I wonder how much of this is the &quot;old world revamp&quot; and how much will actually be important to the level 80 characters we currently have. As for heirlooms I kind of assumed they wouldn't continue past 80.<br />
<br />
Overall it seems more like streamlining than anything else. Hopefully they'll catch up and include what's missing at a later date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been really thinking about coming back for Cat, but those blue posts have turned me off it really quickly. Path of the titans was pretty much the single coolest idea i had heard mentioned, guild talents sounded brilliant and obviously heroic DM and SFK got people very excited.<br />
<br />
Why mention all this stuff blizz just to take it out? I cant find the words to describe how dissapointed i am at this point. <br />
<br />
By that i dont mean that i think cata will be bad, but its just annoying they mention so much that they just say 'nah.' i would rather they mention less and only mention stuff they are 90% sure will be in the game. It just sounds like they are trying to rush it which was the exact mistake with WOTLK. just take your time blizz, this is meant to be an epic, complete overhaul of the game, not just another expansion.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The only thing that would really flip my emotions on it now are the removal or changing of heirlooms. They are the one feature in the game that i cant stand, but would have been outweighed by all of the new crazy stuff they are adding. so much for that :(</div></div><hr />

The Black Dragonflight took Grim Batol in the Night of the Dragon book. Considering that the Twilight Hammer and the Black Dragonflight are working together in Cataclysm, that explains the why.</div></div><hr />

i really don't think that it will work. thise kind of a system have been used in WAR Online and it was horrible. just imagine, you've killed 5|12 bosses, next time 1 or 2 didnt show up and now you've got to find other ppl with 5 bosses killed, and further more, you can't even invite new ppl without any bosses down.</div></div><hr />

you've got to check wowhead &quot;Rather than being locked into a particular raid ID, you can now join any raid, as long as it doesn't have any bosses up that you have already killed.&quot;<br />
<br />
so, fresh person haven't killed any bosses in instance and you've killed 5, so freah person cant join you, couse yiou are already in 5 bosses up to that person.</div></div><hr />

See, people like this guy are the reason why they are dumming the game down. If he can't read patch notes, you can't expect him to play complex game. Read 10 pages of these replies and you will see why they have to do these changes. Because 90% of people who play this game have apple-sized brains.<br />

You can still do normal battlegrounds.<br />
You can still do normal arena.<br />
You can still do 10-man raids.<br />
Your guild will still progress, you just won't have to choose how. (In fact this will help clearing up guild dramas over I WANT EXP / BUT I WANT MORE MONEY)<br />
Archeology is still in game.<br />
3000 new quests are still in game.<br />

What does &quot;Algalon type fight&quot; mean to you? Algalon was the easiest boss in Ulduar, it was the 1hr timer that made it anywhere near a challenge...lol</div></div><hr />

Paths of the Titans was one of the features that sounded really cool and interesting as a form of max level character progression, other than just raiding to get more and more gear. Also wasn't that kind of the whole point with not going to level 90, because we would still have to progress out characters through the paths once we got to 85? Anyway, I'm quite disappointed that they felt it wasn't going to work out, especially after talking so much about it at blizzcon. I guess we'll just have to see how the whole Medium Glyphs thing works out. I must say, though, that the whole Archeology thing seems pretty pointless now and it being left in will feel like an afterthought that just reminds you what it was originally meant to do.<br />
<br />
Guild talents I'm pretty sad to see get thrown out as well. Some of them sounded pretty awesome... raid summon, mass res, more gold from mobs. Pretty nice perks for being in a guild rather than a pug.<br />

Did you just read the white text? <br />
<br />
The guild talents are gone and your guild now gets extra bonuses depending on its level. There are 25 levels and each level will automatically reward with more cool stuff. The leveling process remains unchanged and your guild will gain experience through PvP, Dungeon and Raid progression, questing, etc ...</div></div><hr />

You must be joking with Archeology is still in the game they nerved it beyond what they could do with it same with guild progress by leveling it and a talent tree. Remember the Blizzcon event they announced it with great triumph and made sure every one new it, but now they say its to hard to do and keep everyone happy. Also PvP vs PvE i think blizzard is stupid and lost reality with PvP and PvE split does two up make a PvE tree for normal questing and dungeons/raids, make a tree that is PvP for Arena and BG. After that PvE tree in normal world and PvP in BG and arena's attack some one in real world for PvP all is fair but your not optimized for PvP and you can lose because of the unbalance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, Flame leviathan hard mode was harder than Algalon, i think Algalon took us less than 15 attempts which yes amounted to 3 weeks because of the 1hr timer, not because it was hard. Without the 1hr timer it would have been an ultra easy fight.<br />
<br />
Saying Algalon like encounter doesn't signify anything hard to me, it signifies limited attempts, if they wanted to say ultra hard they could have said &quot;Alone in the darkness&quot; encounter.</div></div><hr />

Path of the Titans gone<br />
Guild Talents gone<br />
Honor titles only for top end teams each season<br />
Archaelogy, the only fun thing.<br />
Rated Battlegrounds = 20v20 size Arena<br />
No Heroics<br />
WTF are we supposed to do all the expansion then?<br />
<br />
This is a sign that WoW officially sucks.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can still do normal battlegrounds.<br />
You can still do normal arena.<br />
You CAN now do rated battlegrounds.<br />
You can still do 10-man raids.<br />
You can still do 25-man raids.<br />
Your guild will still progress, you just won't have to choose how. (In fact this will help clearing up guild dramas over I WANT EXP / BUT I WANT MORE MONEY)<br />
Archeology is still in game.<br />
3000 new quests are still in game.<br />
All the zones are still being redone.<br />
There are still flying mounts in Azeroth.<br />
There are still new raids in Azeroth.<br />
There are still new dungeons in Azeroth. (5-man dungeons and heroics)</div></div><hr />

I freaked the FUCK out when I saw they were removing guild talents, but then I read to the end and now I'm not quite so miffed. We'll still get the awesome guild perks, and all the power isn't in the hands of whoever is spending them, one problem i could see about this though is the PvP/PvE talents? are we going to get a mix of both, or will the system know if you're a PvE/PvP/Mixed guild. For Example my guild is 100% PvE, so if all our XP/Achieves are PvE Achieves, will it only give us the PvE related guild stuff? or will we get a bunch of useless PvP things as well.<br />
<br />
the raids all look AWESOME and LoL at the description of Skywall as a combination of Dalaran, Ulduar and clouds :P<br />
<br />
Hc DM not shipping at release is a bad bad thing though, it was one of the things I was looking forward to most (the others being Guild Talents and PotT....oh) <br />
<br />
overall my amazing excitment for Cata has now dropped back a little, kinda from YAY to....yay, but I'm hoping they'll drop a bomb at some point that'll get my excitment back.</div></div><hr />

Like in a month? They're removing things, saying that classic heroics will be coming in a patch, giving info on raids bosses?<br />
<br />
Definately not anytime soon. We still have:<br />
<br />
1. The Ruby Sanctum and patch 3.3.5<br />
2. The Re-Taking of the Echo Islands/Liberation of Gnomergon (however its spelled, i hate gnomes) and Twilight Hammer doomsayer quests in patch 3.9<br />
<br />
They're not gonna cram all that into one month.<br />
<br />
Word has even been circulating that there is a chance Cata won't even come out this year but early 2011. Of course its all rumors but my gut is telling me not to expect before November-ish.<br />
<br />
P.S. Bastion of Twilight sounds win. Cho'gall is pimp! Between this, the two elemental plane raids and Blackwing Descent, the first tier of Cata is sounding like a MASSIVE improvement over Nax/Os/Maly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rifee</div><div class="date">2010-06-13, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see alot of people here whining , just due to stuff being removes. Take a moment and think about WHY they were removed :)<br />
<br />
Heroic old dungeones not removed but I'll include): These will probably not even be &quot;starter&quot; dungeons (lvl 80) so you wouldn't wanna do them immediately anyway. It also means that after the ex is launched we STILL have stuff to look forward too :)<br />
<br />
Guild talents: Allthough it seems like a cool idea on paper, this feature would have caused nothing but trouble. It would be hard gathering people for a guild who all wanted the same talent layout, and if you for some reason decided to change some talents round, people might leave due to missing out on some personally desired bonuses. Talents will allways implicate a personal interrest, and that doesn't fit good with a guild.<br />
<br />
Path of the titans: Good change imo. The way they presented it, it looked like it would become a mandatory &quot;grind&quot; at high lvl, which people would abandon after having aquired the bonuses they wanted.<br />
By making it more of an &quot;exploration&quot; and &quot;discovery&quot; profession that is also optional and have little pve or pvp impact blizzard has in a good way combined world exploration with this prof.<br />
There are people (including me) who like to just roam around the open world and look for new and undiscovered things, or little hidden clues to unsolved mysteries hidden away or discretly put in for all to see. This profession is a great addition to that, as you can discover important parts of hidden lore, or answer question you've had for long time, and on top of that you might just get a little cosmetic treat every now and then :)<br />
<br />
All in all every change you whine about are all good for the game.<br />
<br />

Since I (and the majority for that matter) aren't interested in leading a guild, it would only cause drama and support picking your guild according to the talents you like, instead of the people in it. I was kinda hoping for them to change that.<br />
<br />
As for the Path of the Titans, it's really disappointing. It was one of the things I was looking for as it would have provided a new way in advancing my character instead of just gear. Also with all the people looking for artifacts, it would have given a new reason to be out in the world instead of just sitting in a capitol and queue for stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rantus</div><div class="date">2010-06-13, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guild improvements are still here, what I make of it is that you'll still have all the same things like mass ress and so on, you just won't have to choose which one to take. Imagine a guild trying to decide what talents to take and so on, arguing and so on. And then there would end up being one best guild tree anyway, with some things just never being used.<br />
<br />
The same for PotT, they wanted it to be a real choice so each character would develop differently, but again this would lead to a best option, and probably people being excluded from guilds/pugs and pvp if they hadn't progressed it far enough. <br />
Imagine the gs tards... &quot;LFM grim batol, link ach, over 7k gs, no noobs, must be max rank PotT&quot;<br />
Getting max level, entry level geared and then having to grind some more until you can raid? Doesn't sound fun. Although, it would have been cool if it really did have a small enough impact to matter, but then it would also be useless.<br />
<br />
Plus, Hc DM and SFK will still be released, and they are just the same instances as before with higher levels, so it doesn't matter as much, as we'll have the new stuff to try anyway.<br />
<br />
Theres still loads of awesome things about Cataclysm, people just pick up on the negatives. All the hardcore elitists should be happy that theres going to be more really hard content only they can see, but not many have noticed among the qq... anyway, cata still looks great imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had already been considering leaving the game because it was getting VERY old... Cataclysm gave me some promise of revitalization and renewed interest. Now it seems they have scrapped anything &quot;new&quot; about it and are just sending us back to Azeroth with a few landscape changes. OH yeah.. 2 new races/starting zones to get you back to level 1 again.<br />
<br />
Even a lot of the content is rehashed... Heroic Deadmines and such.. no wait.. even THEY won't be in the release.<br />
<br />
NOW it seems like a &quot;large patch&quot; more than an expansion.<br />
<br />
I will hold out a little longer til beta is out and more info is available... but it's looking like WoW has finally ran out of reasons for me to stay playing it. Well.. maybe the new MMO project will be something to look forward to. It's pretty clear to me that this decision is a corporate &quot;end of life&quot; choice for the game... and hopefully effort is underway to push development on the new MMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can still do normal battlegrounds.<br />
You can still do normal arena.<br />
You can still do 10-man raids.<br />
Your guild will still progress, you just won't have to choose how. (In fact this will help clearing up guild dramas over I WANT EXP / BUT I WANT MORE MONEY)<br />
Archeology is still in game.<br />
3000 new quests are still in game.<br />
All the zones are still being redone.<br />
There are still flying mounts in Azeroth.<br />
There are still new raids in Azeroth.<br />
There are still new dungeons in Azeroth.<br />
<br />
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, IT'S A F*CKING APLHA. IT'S THERE TO TEST THE CHANGES.<br />
<br />
Can do normal bg but i wont get arena point(conquest point) so harder to get pvp gear, and i dont do arena, never liked, i wanted this expansion because i can finaly play only bg and get gear as good as in arena.<br />
<br />
I will do raids but thats not something im talking about.<br />
I dont care guild progression i wanted the talents to have more fun in the community, im pretty casual, and only play with friends, so thats a fail sir<br />
<br />
Archeology just as much plain now without path of titans as fishin, never liked, blizz said they make so that neither those who got time nor those who not will have advantage in path of titans, guess they gived up early.<br />
<br />
All the zones being redone, and i never complained about that.<br />
And i like the dungeons and raids but not being able to implent a 5 man heroic which already in the game just lame.<br />
<br />
I dont know you and neither you know me so i would like if you dont state things that arent true.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saberoy</div><div class="date">2010-06-13, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were like 3 changes to what they said they were thinking about doing and so many people are crying bloody murder, about to cancel their subscriptions(as if). Really, nothing too amazing was announced. The path of the titans system, as they described it, was glorified leveling after 85. Making you continue to level to gain basic, passive, talent-like things like extra crit % or damage done. And they're scrapping Guild talent tree and instead giving you guild Skills that you still earn as you level your guild up, you still gain guild exp still gain guild bonuses, and still get guild achievements. <br />
<br />
If you are crying so much about these changes that you're ready to not play Cata, and are completely ignoring the whole 2,000 more quests than WOTLK thing, then you were ready to leave the game when you read the post today, and if not, you're just not that bright to begin with.<br />

<br />
&quot;gamona: Ist das sogenannte „Reforging“ eigentlich noch im Spiel – es hieß ja zunächst, das wäre in irgendeiner Form mit Path of the Titans und Archäologie verbunden?&quot;<br />
<br />
Is reforging still in the games as it was rumored to be connected with Path of the Titans.<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom Chilton: Ja, Reforging ist noch im Spiel, allerdings nicht mehr als Teil eines bestimmten Berufszweiges. Stattdessen wird es einen separaten NPC geben, bei dem ihr gegen Gold eure Items bearbeiten könnt. Ihr legt den gewünschten Gegenstand in das Handelsfenster, wählt diejenigen Stats aus, die ihr verringern wollt und welche ihr dafür neu eingravieren wollt. Wenn ihr z.B. Stärke oder Ausdauer auf dem Gegenstand habt, aber lieber Haste darauf möchtet, könnt ihr die bestehenden Stats um die Hälfte verringern und Haste hinzufügen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes its still ingame but its no longer part of a profession. There will be a seperate NPC to change Items for Gold. Its like a trade window..you choose the stat you want to replace..like 100 Stamina gets converted to 50 haste and 50 stamina.<br />
<br />
&quot;gamona: Wird es dabei irgendwelche Restriktionen geben oder Cooldowns?&quot;<br />
<br />
Will there be any restrictions or cooldowns ?<br />
<br />
&quot;Tom Chilton: Nein, Cooldowns gibt es keine. Es kostet lediglich etwas Gold, das Reforging durchzuführen. Allerdings dürft ihr jedes Item nur ein einziges Mal verändern.&quot;<br />
<br />
No cooldowns just some gold to reforge the item. But you can only reforge an item ONCE.<br />

Re mapped content ( oh the horror of dumping a ocean on Thousand Needles - one of the breathtakers from vanilla). Only 5 new lvls. No expanded talent trees. Failure on switching out the &quot;dull&quot; talents (now they apply automatic) with anything interesting - why do this in the first place? And now they scrapped the thing which could have spiced up character building - Path of the titans:/<br />
<br />
I guess the reason to buy Cataclysm is getting new instances and new quest - but what fun is it doing 3000 quest for Xp, if your character dosnt evolves one bit? What fun is there getting a lvl if anything interesting in the talent trees are covered allready? You wont get any more dmg - cause mastery caps at 51, you wont be able to get fun talents, because they are absent. <br />
<br />

<br />
99% of these posts are complaining about things that are still there, just changed to be automatic. Guild leveling is still there, Archaeology is still there, everything is basically still here. Any customization with PotT? Really? People were just going to do the exact same glyph/whatever set up, and you know it. How is that not &quot;cookie cutter&quot;. The best way is always the way people will go. A horrible idea in my mind, why would I want more things to worry about to level before I can do things when I hit max level? It's too much as it is now. I have to get my glyphs/talents/gear (and now guild levels) ready and now I have another whole talent tree and profession to level to raid/battleground? It's too much people, and I'm glad Blizzard realized it. <br />
<br />
The new guild leveling system will be so awesome. I'm actually leading a 10-man guild in Cataclysm, and it's all my old Karazhan guild mates. It's awesome that 10/25 man raids share the same loot table now. Now I can raid with my friends without any pressure from some elitist who whispers me &quot;WHY ARE YOU NOT USING SPEED POTIONS ON TRASH LIKE ME?&quot;. I'll have fun getting together, doing quests/dungeons/battlegrounds with 9 other people to get my rep for my guild up, and advance the guild level. <br />

If you're canceling your sub because of one baby thing that was scraped then good, go far away, back to Aion or something. There are far many things in Cataclysm that are going to improve the game then some re-worked silly instance or another annoying grind.</div></div><hr />

Re mapped content ( oh the horror of dumping a ocean on Thousand Needles - one of the breathtakers from vanilla). Only 5 new lvls. No expanded talent trees. Failure on switching out the &quot;dull&quot; talents (now they apply automatic) with anything interesting - why do this in the first place? And now they scrapped the thing which could have spiced up character building - Path of the titans:/<br />
<br />
&quot;only 5 new levels&quot;? You don't know how long those levels will take. The number doesn't equal amount of time needed, so the number is completely arbitrary. How can there be a failure of switching out dull talents when it is still a work in progress? I doubt you could come up with a good amount of &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;interesting&quot; new talents anyway, because they would need many new which would likely lead to even more homogenization. <br />
<br />
Path of the Titans would have only forced every single person to grind away with Archeology because nobody would want to group you with in any dungeon without having everything maxed out. Do you think it is bad today with the GS nonsense? It would be even worse with the addition of Path of the Titans and the forced grind on everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess the reason to buy Cataclysm is getting new instances and new quest - but what fun is it doing 3000 quest for Xp, if your character dosnt evolves one bit? What fun is there getting a lvl if anything interesting in the talent trees are covered allready? You wont get any more dmg - cause mastery caps at 51, you wont be able to get fun talents, because they are absent. <br />
<br />
How does your character not evolve one bit when you are getting new abilities from level 80 to 85? I don't see how getting extra talents, albeit ones you may have seen before, is less about evolving your character. And you do get more damage because there are still talents which will boost that. Not every damage talent is being removed in favor of the Mastery.<br />
<br />
<br />
To me it looks like wow is going from beeing a RPG game to a Explorer/backpacker game.<br />
Idk. Ppl are most likely going to pay and play anyways - the mmo scene lacks decent alternatives unless youre a sucker for Asian Glam Fantasy.<br />
<br />
Funny. So WoW is less of an RPG game with actual RPG-elements such as exploring? The way Archeology is going to be now is actually making it more of an RPG, not less.<br />
<br />
I wasn't happy about the removal of Path of the Titans either until I realized how much of a forced grind it would be. It may not be grindy because you would have gotten it for doing anything, but players would have made it completely mandatory to do the easiest of tasks in the game as they already do with the GS-requirement. It is rather looney to act as if the removal of that feature makes Cataclysm all of the sudden not worth it or just a patch. They are adding 3 times as many quests to this expansion than the current one. People may not care about quests but those are actual the staple of what makes this an RPG. When you feel the removal of Path of the Titans is so bad which makes this expansion too much like TBC or Wrath I really wonder why people have continued to play this game for so long when they seem to in fact hate/loathe the current features of the game. If you really want something completely different, you may want to look into a completely new game instead of thinking expansions should significantly alter the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz really dropped the ball, everyone knows why PotT and guild talents got dropped right? and why SFK and DM will not be released with xpac. Blizz ran out of time. its why the op. gnomer and Zalizane were tested with 3.3.5 and I doubt we will even see a 3.3.9, how sad that a epic idea got trashed because of time restraints.<br />
<br />
its rather depressing, I was very much looking forward to to PotT, archeology, which would give us a reason to explore Azeroth with our 85 toons, which now I think most people wont even bother to do. and a lot of the changes to landscape will go unnoticed, unless your an altaholic. and guild leveling, that was gated so that everyone had the chance of staying competitive. gone. My plans for bringing up my guild as a Gold cartell is no longer an option. <br />
<br />
Only thing I am looking forward to now is leveling new toons in different regions to see changed content. End content will be dumbed down by the time I get my new toon to 85, so there is no point rushing into it, like I was hoping to do. <br />
<br />
Really disappointing.</div></div><hr />

Path of the Titans gone? They trumpeted this during the last BlizzCon as being &quot;alternate progression&quot; and altogether entwined with the storyline, especially with the Twilight Hammer's involvement. So now that's all been trashed? And Archeology, which fed into Path of the Titans... now marginalized. It's unfortunate. Between those two, there was a great potential for character story development (not just measurable progression), and now that's been flushed. :(</div></div><hr />

I can't believe they're going to force you to join pre-mades in order to play rated Battlegrounds. The whole reason I loved BGs was because I could get on whenever I wanted to, play for as long as I wanted to, and then get off. This is just the same system as Arena on a bigger scale which is exactly what I didn't want seeing as how horribly stupid Arena is. <br />
<br />
And they're rewarding legacy titles to people for this shit on top of everything else? <br />

Rated battlegrounds make all sense in the fact that you need to play with bigger groups to get better stuff. It is the same with raiding and now it starts to be the same with battlegrounds. Arena was the dull thing, not rated battlegrounds. Arena should be like the PvP equivalent to 5 mans in PvE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In reality, Activision probably heard that FF14 or SW:TOR was shipping soon and they wanted to release around the same time. Just goes to show that anyone who didn't believe that Activision changed the way Blizzard operates is probably in denial (though that was obvious after shiny horse.)</div></div><hr />

I see that Guild Wars 2 is having a system just like Path of the Titans called &quot;Traits&quot; where you have to become more involved in your character's life, such as an Elementalist has to explore ancient tombs to discover ancient spells. I'm now looking forward to this more than I am to WoW even though it comes out this winter :/.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont buy this &quot;its all numbers anyways&quot; mantra. Fantasy RPG games is all about making those numbers( data) into a interesting illusion. A level is a Carrot on a Stick, a reward for doing stuff`. By cutting down the lvls but maintaining the time spent, you cut out 5 Carrots. Thats downplaying the whole concept of lvl`ing. Its fun to ding. You get talent points, new spells, acces to new gear and instances. If players are getting 2 talent points and twice te amount of abillitys in Cata, it would be a tie. That dosnt seem to be the case though.<br />
<br />
The fun and interesting talents could be found in abundence in either the suggestion forums or the first found 3rd addition AD&amp;D Player handbook you google. I doubt the best of the best game designer (they all end up at Blizzard) would need any of that though. <br />
Typical fun talents are for me stuff like - Slow, Shadowstep, Heroic Leap, Natures Swift and suchs.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;<br />
Path of the Titans would have only forced every single person to grind away with Archeology because nobody would want to group you with in any dungeon without having everything maxed out. Do you think it is bad today with the GS nonsense? It would be even worse with the addition of Path of the Titans and the forced grind on everyone..<br />
My hope was that we would have seen the fun and utillity kinda abillitys in Path. And that it would be a way to keep progressing your character over time instead of ending up with the usualy badge grind.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Im positive about the new spells. Its cool. But its still hard not to weigh it up against TBC and WOTLK, where you got those new abillitys ( Bloodlust/Heroism, Icelance, Savage Roar, Fan of Knives etc etc) On top of interesting talents.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;<br />

<br />
Exploring is fine. I like Adventure games - even though they tend to bore me in the length. Adding a RPG element to a Adventure game can seriously spice it up. Removing the RPG element from a RPG game ( or tone it down)might risk doing the opposite.<br />
The promised concept of the Path was that it *wouldnt* be a grind. It would open up step by step.<br />
<br />
A zillion quest is fine if you can use them to progress through. But if you cut out character progress, quest are only really rewarding gold/rep/achivements.<br />
And let me be clear - is not the removal of the Path alone which make me disapointed. Its the direction this expansion have taken - we have been around more then just Path in this post alone. Everything is &quot;less&quot; and apperantly more about streamlining then adding.<br />
Offcourse i could allso just throw in the towel and play something else. But i kinda like Wow, and i really, really hope Cataclysm will be worth playing. I guess thats why alot of ppl would like to se a reassuring from the devs that Cataclysm indeed will ship with alot of really interesting features.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RumlyD</div><div class="date">2010-06-13, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After digesting this news, I think it should be pretty obvious that this is more of a refinement of the original concepts. They are taking what was good about those features and keeping them in the game, while removing the downsides. <br />
<br />
As others have pointed out I think having to rely on Archaeology to slowly unlock what ultimately amounts to an expanded glyph system, was not the way to go. Also it was going to really be a barrier to playing alts. They can really make the glyph system quite a lot better this way I think, without having it depend on an extra mechanic that ties into a secondary prof. The more I think about that, the more I realize this seems like a much better implementation than what was originally planned. I'm interested to see what kind of stuff the medium glyphs will offer, I suppose a lot of cosmetic or convenience things that should give people chance to individualize their char? Sounds good.<br />
<br />
As for guild talents; I guess they just realized that there was going to be always be one ideal spec, and also that it could hamper guilds that want to do pvp and pve. This way we get (one can assume) most of the perks they had planned without having to choose between them. As someone else said, talent trees are a very individual thing and probably weren't going to translate too well to a guild setting.<br />
<br />
Now if these changes also mean they are able to finish work on the expansion faster, then I guess that's a nice bonus but I would doubt if that was the main driving factor behind the decision. That just doesn't seem to be Blizz's style. They will always do what they believe to be best for the game they are making, before panicking about release dates (in my opinion).</div></div><hr />
