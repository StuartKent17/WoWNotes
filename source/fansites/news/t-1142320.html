This change is already live on US realms, but not on the EU realms.<br />
At the completion of scheduled server maintenance during the week of June 5, the “Power of the Aspects” spell will grow more powerful, reducing the health and damage dealt of all enemies in the Dragon Soul raid by 25%. This spell has grown progressively stronger over time to reduce difficulty and make the encounters more accessible. The spell will affect both normal and Heroic difficulties, but it will not affect the Raid Finder difficulty.<br />
<br />
If you don’t need the help of the Dragon Aspects, the spell can be disabled by talking to Lord Afrasastrasz at the beginning of Dragon Soul.<br />
<br />
We hope you continue to enjoy Dragon Soul, and that these changes encourage you to attempt a higher difficulty, or just keep pushing to take down that next boss.<br />

The Future of PvP in Mists of Pandaria<br />
With the Mists of Pandaria beta in full swing we thought we’d take this opportunity to shed some light on what lays ahead for PvP. To that end, we sat down with World of Warcraft Game Director Tom Chilton to discuss the future of PvP in Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
What is the overarching design philosophy for PvP in Mists of Pandaria?<br />
We want to have more new PvP content than we’ve ever had before. With this expansion we’re adding two completely new Battlegrounds with new gameplay types. We’ve never done that before at the start of an expansion. We also have a new Arena to add to the current pool of options. That will bring our count of Battlegrounds up to ten and our Arena count to six.<br />
<br />
<br />

Temple of Kot'mogu - Who's got the relic now? <br />
<br />
How is the war being brought back to World of Warcraft in relation to PvP?<br />
Well, the best answer to that is that we’re very deliberately trying to get people back out into the world, and so that means on a PvP realm, you’ll have more people to kill that are out in the world. Generally speaking, the most fun outdoor PvP is just the spontaneous conflict that happens as a natural result of people being out in the world. It’s not the stuff the designers create for you.<br />
<br />
Many players on PvE realms are concerned about being forced to PvP or take part in World PvP when they don’t want to, what can you say to them about the plans for this?<br />
There are no plans to force PvP on players who are on PvE realms. Their experience shouldn’t change and they’ll have the same opportunities for PvP (if they wish to take part) as they do now. It’s also worth noting that the Black Market Auction House has the potential to become a world PvP location for those on PvP realms. Just like the name implies, these are goods being sold out in shady locations away from the prying eyes of guards in the cities. They are not in neutral or safe zones. For PvE realms, it’s not going to have that same risk for placing a bid as on a PvP realm (aside from being outbid).<br />
<br />
<br />

Temple of Kotmogu - Plenty of room to run and run and run.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, PvPers are afraid that things won’t be taken far enough and they won’t get the world PvP they want; they often mention the issue of guards in major cities hampering their ability to do these raids. What could you say about that?<br />
We know that for many PvPers, the idea of getting a large raid (or two) together to invade a city is something that can make for great world PvP. We also know that there has been an issue with guards causing this to be a less appealing undertaking for them as the guards have gotten stronger. We obviously want those guards there doing their jobs, but we don’t want them to be the wall that you just can’t get over. So, we are planning to adjust the guards only on PvP realms to where they aren’t quite as strong as you’d find them on a PvE realm, and they won’t respawn quite as quickly either. We’re still working on this, but we hope to get this adjustment in before the release of Mists of Pandaria. It’s worth noting that the guards on PvE realms will remain the same as they are now.<br />
<br />

Temple of Kotmogu - One of four artifacts in Temple of Kotmogu<br />
<br />
How is it possible to make it different between the realm types when it wasn’t in the past?<br />
The difference is in the available technology that we have now that we didn’t have in the past. As the game has evolved over the years, so has technology and our capability to find ways to implement that new technology that makes our ideas of “what if” or “wouldn’t it be cool” become reality. With the change to the guards, we think that could be a real game changer for those that really like the idea of raiding cities or areas and holding them against the “enemy”. Beyond that though, there isn’t really a difference, but with the new daily quest hubs, it should prove to be a real hotspot for PvP on a regular basis.<br />

Silvershard Mine - Which switch is which? <br />
<br />
Will there be bigger changes between PvP and PvE realms in the future?<br />
It’s always a possibility. We want to see how things go with these changes first. We don’t want to promise any big plans at this point in time, but we are always thinking of ways we can add to the experience where we can.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/june/thumb/moppvp05.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/june/moppvp05.jpg) <br />
Silvershard Mine - Up or down?<br />
<br />
What about the general idea that there aren’t enough people out in the world to even engage in PvP?<br />
The new Cross-Realm Zones technology that we introduced recently in the beta should also help make sure more world PvP happens.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/june/thumb/moppvp06.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/june/moppvp06.jpg)<br />
Silvershard Mine - Almost there... <br />
<br />
What about the use of flying mounts? Many players are concerned about the use of flying mounts to avoid having to ever engage in PvP on PvP realms.<br />
We know this is a concern and we have some things in mind for helping in this regard. First, we’re limiting the use of flying mounts within Mists of Pandaria to level 90. Second, with so many players taking part in the quest hubs, we think we’ll see a lot more PvP happening out in the world. After all, you have to land sometime. If that’s not enough though, we have an item that we’re adding to the game that players will be able to use from the ground that makes it possible to dismount a flying enemy player (within a reasonable range and PvP flagged). We’re still discussing the particulars of how this item will be available.<br />
<br />
Will there be a Wintergrasp or Tol Barad for Mists of Pandaria?<br />
No. We’re deliberately trying to get people out into the world and these areas ended up being more like instanced areas than World PvP. We don’t want to create another one and have it result in the same sort of gameplay. With that being said though, we’ve instead moved the bosses you would have found within an instance like Baradin Hold out into the world. We think the allure of a boss kill is a great impetus to go out into the world and engage in PvP.<br />
<br />
Could you recap the new battlegrounds that are being added? What new gameplay styles do the two new Battlegrounds have to offer players?<br />
We have two new Battlegrounds that we’ve talked about before, each featuring a completely new type of gameplay that we haven’t had available before.<br />
<br />
The design of the Silvershard Mine hasn’t really changed since we last discussed it at our Mists of Pandaria media event. Players essentially escort one of several mining carts to a depot to score points. Strategic locations will feature switches that allow you to change tracks. The more people you have helping out, the better, though you’re going to want to stop or at least stall the other team from getting their carts into a depot as well.<br />
<br />
For our other Battleground, Temple of Kotmogu, we’ve made some slight changes since we last talked about it at the event. We did some internal testing with just one artifact and discovered that the gameplay devolved into a sort of deathmatch in the center of the map. So we didn’t just double the amount of artifacts that were in play, we quadrupled it and ended up with four artifacts at different spots that could be used to score points. You’ll still score the most points for staying in the center area of the of the field of battle, but there’s a lot more going on with four artifacts to keep track of and hand off to your team.<br />
<br />

Tol'vir Proving Grounds - Three is the number<br />
<br />
Is the way we queue for Battlegrounds changing at all?<br />
Yes, we’re adding a way for players to down-vote two Battlegrounds that they don’t want to see show up when queuing for random Battlegrounds. The exception to this is if it’s the Battleground featured with Call to Arms. You won’t be able to down-vote those when they happen, but this should make it so that it’s less likely you’ll be taking part in a Battleground that you don’t particularly enjoy. It should also help make it more likely that when a particular Battleground comes up on the Call to Arms, you may be able to enjoy it more. We’re also changing the way Call to Arms works so that there will always be a Call to Arms Battleground available. This will allow us to cycle through a larger amount of Battlegrounds on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
When will players get to try out the new Battlegrounds for themselves?<br />
We’re hoping to have these new battlegrounds in the beta for everyone to play within the next couple of weeks or so. We’re looking forward to getting everyone’s feedback and seeing how they play out with a larger test audience.<br />
<br />

Tol'vir Proving Grounds - A peaceful arial view<br />
<br />
Is anything changing with Arenas?<br />
Yes, actually. Players will be able to see their opponent’s class and specialization before the match begins. They won’t be able to see the specific talent choices or glyphs being used, however. From there, it’s a bit like playing poker. You won’t know what exact abilities your opponent is using, but you’ll be able to modify your own talents in the staging area before the match starts to try to anticipate what they could be using.<br />

Tol'vir Proving Grounds - Are you worthy?<br />
<br />
Is anything changing with Rated Battlegrounds?<br />
We don’t have any changes planned for Rated Battlegrounds at this time, though we may at some point in the future decide to add in the newest Battlegrounds, Silvershard Mine and Temple of Kotmogu.</div></div><hr />

It'll be pretty faceroll when it gets that high. As it is now, you can 'break' some of the fights by pushing phases too fast with the nerfs and people's increasingly higher dps output.</div></div><hr />

It is, if you read the note that is what it suggested:<br />

Yeah but it's pretty easy to tell which class is stealthed anyway....if rogue they have crit bonus, if druid they have MotW, etc.<br />

I don't know what to think about the arena change, talent being something really trivial and cooki cutter build being gone this could lead some really interesting arena game (i guess). Sure you know the spec but you don't know the talent and that's the important stuff.<br />

Edit: Was WoW written in Basic? Go back to middle school, maybe?<br />

Further edit: The only &quot;world PvP&quot; anyone mentions has nostalgic references to South Shore vs. Tarren Mill, when there weren't any BGs available. That was true world PvP and that, my dearies, will never exist until BGs are gone (which will never happen). The *other* (and IMO &quot;fake&quot;) world PvP that people might be pining for are the old videos of Undead Rogues pwning *anyone* because they were the only ones able to get 100% speed mounts, where nobody could escape said Rogues, and videos such as World of Roguecraft were born.<br />

If there is ever such a craving for world PvP, your server will birth it, not Blizzard.<br />

One more edit: On the SS vs. TM topic, isn't it ironic that SS was a flight path for Alliance, and TM a flight path for Horde? Early workings of BG queues, methinks. No &quot;world PvP&quot; has ever occurred in some obscure, hard to reach place...why? Because people CBA to go there. Guess what? Even &quot;world PvP&quot; in MoP will have flight paths for each side, which is basically the same as a queue time for a BG.

I mentally cried in anguish when I read that part of the blue post. I just can't see moving the VoA-style bosses outdoors as a good idea, especially if they're not on a relatively quick spawn timer. I also foresee certain guilds on my realm just griefing everybody else by either camping the boss(es), sowing confusion among a raid group, and/or flagging themselves to cause others to -- unwillingly, of course -- get flagged.<br />
<br />
World PvP? Sounds like Scourge Invasion v2.0 instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, just imagine the mess from the Pit competition it would force. Just an anecdote, but I haven't seen Doom Lord Kazzak in years, exactly because he is a world boss and he's always dead the instant server maintenance ends (yay for 7-day timer).<br />
<br />
Now sure, DLK is outdated and easy to pwn with today's stat inflation, but looking immediately ahead... just how is it not going to be any different with the proposed outdoor VoA-ish bosses (without moving forward an expansion)?<br />
<br />
All I see is griefing, ganking, and most others simply getting left behind.</div></div><hr />

Speaking of which, I don't really think of the SS vs TM as world PvP. It was just players ganking/griefing others and vice versa at the flight masters because at the time, flight points weren't continuous. So this whole &quot;world PvP&quot; that people go on about never really existed in the first place. And as another person pointed out, the only real way to create &quot;world PvP&quot; would be to take away the battlegrounds and arena. That is never going to happen.</div></div><hr />

That was of their (the people) own volition (and cross-server, at that...SS vs. TM was not just a 1 or 2 server only interest...meaning, it happened on multiple servers). It's kind of how, in old school EQ, some servers used GFaydark as the trade zone. Some use ECommons...and some used North Freeport; we did that on our OWN. Nothing will bring back world PvP...but the players. Blizzard can do things to encourage it, but methinks most people will neglect these in lieu of other options. So stop bitching about something Blizzard CANNOT force.<br />
<br />
Edit: just because I know someone will...by &quot;cannot force&quot;, I mean...if Blizzard *did* force World PvP, people would still bitch...<br />
<br />
We're all complaining about a game and service that we pay to play, but we (yes, sometimes myself) forget that we also choose to pay to play. The term &quot;Warcraft&quot; was born back when you just fought against computer AI; it's kinda like how &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; hasn't been &quot;Final&quot; for years. The word &quot;World&quot; just seemed nifty when it applied to the (at the time) possibility that millions would play the same game...so don't give me that shit either. WoW was never meant to be a PvP centric game; it was meant to improve upon PvE centric games like EQ that came before it.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, I liked the news, myself. I approve the changes they are making and I hope they will make sure the item that dismounts works well enough to be effective. <br />

Also, thank you Blizzard for letting us see who the opponents are and their specs before an Arena match starts. A great change, really.</div></div><hr />

As we have seen since BC, that dosen't work. These so called &quot;Hardcore&quot; pvpr's cry about no world pvp, when all they want to do is sit in town and farm BG's. It won't work. As for when they said flying mounts will be limited to only lvl 90's, WTF? really? is this supposed to be new? because it isn't...... Had to be 70 in BC, 78 in WOTLK, and about the same for the azeroth one.</div></div><hr />

Something like the grappling hook used in the daily quest in twilight highlands to grip the dwarves and pull then too your spot. So in essence it would be like a deathgrip that dismounts the player. Ofc some restrictions would be needed, such as :<br />
can only be used on flying players. |Edit| actually thinking that being usable on normal mounted players wouldn't be all bad either. Would be fun to see in field of strife in AV. |Edit|<br />
only while not in combat <br />
a short cast time, so no flying up &gt; dismounting &gt; grip / dismount them &gt; you slow fall, they just fall.<br />
40 yrd range.<br />
<br />
Make it a crafted BoE item by engineers with a funny malfunction proc on it for extra sh!ts and giggles. Like instead of dismounting and pulling them to you, it stuns you and reels you up to them where you then proceed to fall to the ground, thus reducing your hp by a large chunk, and maybe the player you just tried to dismount might just finish you off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But this was the worst news I've heard in a while. Glad GW2 is not too far away.<br />
<br />
Um how about no, PVP and PVE need MORE changes like this so the PVP hungry masses on PVE servers will MOVE to the proper server that is their chosen style and stop ruining the PVE servers. I am glad to see they are changing guards on PVP realms only, if anything they should buff them on PVE realms (Around all low level cities) to 10-15 levels higher than max level, and increase their spawn times so they respawn faster. If people want WORLD PVP they can go to a PVP server and knock them selves out, and leave the normal people alone who don't give a rats arse about any form of PVP what so ever.<br />
<br />
As for Removing flying mounts that is the worst idea ever, everyone spewing that nonsense doesn't seem to realize that would be the fastest way of killing this game. Either that or they don't care because they would be getting their way on the PVP front. Their way of handling it is fine, and a better option than removing flying mounts by far. ;/</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not how it works. They can not sell the loot. It's using the new LFR loot system which every person involved in the kill (in the same raid group as the person that tagged it) gets a roll. Anyone that rolls over 85 (or some other random number) gets a piece of loot. This means 1 or 30 people might get loot from it, and the numbers don't matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you are correct on is the ganking/stealing of the boss tag. If a guild group tags it, you don't get loot until the boss is reset and you tag it.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Plus, if you miss out on it so what? It's not like it drops anything that you can't obtain other ways (unless it drops a mount or something, but again, its not a game breaker).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're really oversimplifying the whole process, but we get your *point* (if you had one).<br />
<br />
Edit: Was WoW written in Basic? Go back to middle school, maybe?<br />
<br />
Further edit: The only &quot;world PvP&quot; anyone mentions has nostalgic references to South Shore vs. Tarren Mill, when there weren't any BGs available. That was true world PvP and that, my dearies, will never exist until BGs are gone (which will never happen). The *other* (and IMO &quot;fake&quot;) world PvP that people might be pining for are the old videos of Undead Rogues pwning *anyone* because they were the only ones able to get 100% speed mounts, where nobody could escape said Rogues, and videos such as World of Roguecraft were born.<br />
<br />
If there is ever such a craving for world PvP, your server will birth it, not Blizzard.<br />
<br />
One more edit: On the SS vs. TM topic, isn't it ironic that SS was a flight path for Alliance, and TM a flight path for Horde? Early workings of BG queues, methinks. No &quot;world PvP&quot; has ever occurred in some obscure, hard to reach place...why? Because people CBA to go there. Guess what? Even &quot;world PvP&quot; in MoP will have flight paths for each side, which is basically the same as a queue time for a BG. (unless you count the possible [and inevitable] lower-level ganking that will occur because of cross-realm leveling zones).<br />
<br />
Umm, Halaa? My realm had at least a battle a day there during BC, with near-constant skirmishing at the Hellfire fortresses.</div></div><hr />

This is especially true as right now I know of one PVE server currently that has a gang of bullies came over from a PVP server just to bully the other faction knowing they'll get little resistance as they're focused on PVE. <br />

You sound like a PVE server PVP wannabe, if you want to PVP and raid cities so much then roll on a PVP server see how long you last on there..<br />
<br />
PVPer on a PVP server top of their game as they have to look over their shoulder 100% of the time and know how to survive there. PVPer on a PVE realm are PVP wannabe's who would last 1/4 of a second on a PVP Server.<br />
<br />
Basically people who cant cut the mustard PVP wise roll a toon on a PVE server..<br />

That is silly you obviously never played during The Burning Crusade expac world PVP in as was said before Hellfire Peninsula and Halaa and we had flying mounts then. And to some extent there was world PVP in Wrath of The Lich King in Wintergrasp and what we had flying mounts there too. So what you say about taking out flying mounts will help initiate world PVP is just pure BS.<br />
<br />
But really come on it is up to the players to initiate PVP themselves and not to have to rely on Blizzard to do it for you.</div></div><hr />

You are correct; I was forgetting about the new loot system. I still disagree with your last part, though. Certainly there will be other ways to obtain the said gear, but wasn't the addition of the loot-piñata VoA and Tol Barad to allow (all) players with bad RNG get another try? And yet, all I foresee is the truly hardcore receiving the benefit of an additional loot table. I can definitely say that on my realm, there is an... unpopular... guild that unfortunately is among the very best. Depending somewhat on the spawn timer being, they'll love being able to hoard the world bosses where/when they can and mock others who'll complain about their behavior.</div></div><hr />

The world bosses won't be in cross realm zones, that'd be extremely dim. And he did intimate that these world bosses would provide the loot we're accustomed to getting from VoA/BH.<br />
<br />
They're great for Horde/Alliance wPvP, they're not so great in that they'll also create a lot of internal faction squabbling.<br />
<br />
The realm first achievements are there because there will be one hell of a PvP battle over them for that first kill, being able to hold off constant attacks and successfully down it will be extremely difficult.</div></div><hr />
