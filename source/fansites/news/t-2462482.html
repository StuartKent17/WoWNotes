<br />
The Alliance will strike at the heart of the Zandalari empire—while the defenders of the Horde will rally to their new allies’ defense—in an epic new raid, Battle of Dazar’alor. This new raid provides both Horde and Alliance players with unique encounters for their faction—along with the opportunity to play through events from the opposite faction’s viewpoint. Learn more (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22839056/).<br />
<br />
PvP Season 2 Begins<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/thumb/newraid02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/newraid02.jpg) <br />
<br />
PvP Season 2 will begin and introduce an updated Conquest reward schedule, mounts, and gear. Players who earn 500 Conquest points in a given week through PvP activities including Arenas, Battlegrounds, and Assaults in War Mode will be still be able to choose a piece of gear from each week’s selection; in addition, they’ll now earn a Quartermaster’s Coin, which can be collected and ultimately used to upgrade pieces from this season’s Sinister Gladiator PvP set. Learn more (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22864557/battle-for-azeroth-pvp-season-2-begins-january-22).<br />
<br />
Mythic Keystone Dungeon Season 2 Begins<br />
The new Mythic Keystone Dungeon season opens opportunities for new rewards and a new challenge with the new seasonal affix: Reaping. High-level Keystones will now summon Bwonsamdi, the Loa of Death, to wreak some spectral havoc upon players’ dungeon run. As heroes kill enemies, the vanquished spirits will continue to linger in the mortal realm. At certain points throughout the dungeon, Bwonsamdi will resurrect these twisted souls, who will swarm the unfortunate adventurers in a final act of vengeance. (Blog coming soon.)<br />

Azerite Armor Updates<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/thumb/newraid03.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/newraid03.jpg)<br />
<br />
With the release of Season 2, we’re introducing new epic Azerite pieces from PvP Season 2, the Battle of Dazar’alor raid, World Quest Emissaries, and from the Mythic Keystone vendor Thaumaturge Vashreen in Zuldazar and Boralus. These new items will have a fifth ring with additional new trait options. Learn more (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22864558/tides-of-vengeance-part-2-azerite-armor-updates-changes).<br />
<br />
Content Difficulty and Rewards Changes<br />
With a new season upon us and the Dazar’alor raid dungeon opening, we wanted to share some additional information on the changes coming to a variety of dungeon and outdoor world encounters including increases to both difficulty and rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Maximum Item Level: With great challenges come great rewards and the maximum possible item level will go up to 425.<br />
Battle for Darkshore Warfront: Battle for Darkshore rewards will also increase to 400 from both the outdoor boss and from Warfront quest that can be completed once per cycle. The difficulty of the Warfront will increase however, and the item level required to queue will increase to 335. These changes will go into effect after the current Warfront cycle has ended. Until that time, players will still receive Season 1 rewards.<br />
World Quest Emissary Rewards: World Quest Emissary weapon and armor rewards will also now scale up to 385 based on the player’s own item level. Rewards from the original Battle for Azeroth Launch World bosses will remain at item level 355 to stay on par with Uldir.<br />
Dungeon Rewards and Difficulty: The difficulty of Heroic and Mythic dungeons will also be increase as follows: Normal–340, Heroic–355, and Mythic– 370(baseline)<br />
Mythic Keystone Dungeons and PvP: During the first week of Season 2 Mythic Keystone Dungeon rewards will be capped at Mythic 6 quality (item level 385). PvP Season 2 end-of-match rewards will be capped at 385.<br />
Seals of Wartorn Fate: Seals of Wartorn Fate are not being reset and this same currency can be used for Battle of Dazar’alor and Season 2 bonus rolls; the cap on how many can be held at once remains at 5.<br />
<br />

Tides of Vengeance Part 2: Azerite Armor Updates &amp; Changes<br />
Since the launch of Battle for Azeroth, players have been empowering their Heart of Azeroth (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22010728) and collecting Azerite armor to gear up for the battles ahead. Since then, we’ve made a variety of adjustments to the system—and we have a few more updates coming with the second part of Tides of Vengeance on January 22 that we’d like go into more detail on today.<br />
<br />
With the release of Battle for Azeroth Season 2, we’re introducing new epic Azerite pieces that you can acquire through a variety of methods, including Season 2 PvP, the Battle of Dazar’alor raid, World Quest Emissaries, and from the Mythic Keystone vendor Thaumaturge Vashreen in Zuldazar and Boralus. These new items will have a fifth ring with additional new trait options and is available at Heart of Azeroth level 15. <br />
<br />
This new outer ring provides two choices of traits per specialization, giving players an opportunity to find items that have traits they particularly want—and the freedom to create new and interesting combinations that may not have been possible before. This additional ring of traits makes each item have a larger impact on your character’s overall power.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/thumb/azeriterings.png (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/january/azeriterings.png) <br />
<br />
<br />
Outer Ring:<br />
Powers that reside in the new outer ring provide two additional trait options for each of your character’s available specializations. <br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Moment of Repose (Discipline)<br />
<br />
(Passive) Pain Suppression applies Atonement to the target and instantly heals them for 15,313.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Second Ring:<br />
Powers that reside on the second ring from the outside will often be influenced by where you collected the piece of armor they’re found on. These powers can also be associated with specific class specializations.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Seductive Power<br />
<br />
(Passive) Your spells and abilities have a chance to conjure Bwonsamdi’s spectral visage, beckoning you closer. If you approach him, gain 57 to all stats for 5 minutes, stacking up to 5 times. If you fail to heed his call, lose 1 stack.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Third Ring:<br />
These powers generally benefit the performance of your in-game role—they’ll provide damage increases for DPS classes, increase damage mitigation for tanks, or bolster healing output for healers.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Bracing Chill<br />
<br />
(Passive) Your heals have a chance to apply Bracing Chill. Healing a target with Bracing Chill will heal for an additional 2,574 and move Bracing Chill to a nearby ally (up to 6 times).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fourth Ring:<br />
These are defensive or utility-oriented powers for your class.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
Vampiric Speed<br />
<br />
(Passive) When an enemy you harmed dies, you heal for 6,361 and gain 93 Speed for 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fifth Ring:<br />
Azerite Empowerment is the power that resides at the center, and increases an armor piece’s item level by 5. <br />
<br />
New Traits to Discover<br />
You’ll also find new location-specific traits that scale with item level and are available on gear from the Battle of Dazar’alor raid, including:<br />
<br />
<br />
Bonded Souls: Your spells and abilities have a chance to trigger a Soulbond for 15 seconds. During Soulbond, every 5 seconds you and your nearest ally are both healed for 3,456 and gain 141 Haste for 5 seconds.<br />
Seductive Power: Your spells and abilities have a chance to conjure Bwonsamdi’s spectral visage, beckoning you closer. If you approach him, gain 26 to all stats for 5 minutes, stacking up to 5 times. If you fail to heed his call, lose 1 Stack. <br />
Treacherous Covenant: Your primary stat is increased by 151 while you are above 50% health. You take 15% increased damage while below 20% health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Azerite Knowledge<br />
With the start of Season 2, we’re also adding 10 more ranks of Azerite Knowledge over the course of January 22 through March. Each rank of Artifact Knowledge increases the speed at which your Heart of Azeroth levels up.<br />
<br />
Tides of Vengeance Recap: Trait Updates and Additions<br />
With the launch of Tides of Vengeance on December 11, we replaced many of the Azerite traits we weren’t happy with and continue to iterate on various elements of the system to provide variety and flexibility in player gear choices.<br />
<br />
NEW TRAITS IN THE DARKSHORE WARFRONT<br />
It’s a good time to keep an eye on the shifting tides of the Darkshore Warfront. We added many new Azerite Armor traits that are just waiting to be collected, including:<br />
<br />
<br />
Ancients Bulwark: Standing still grants you Deep Roots, increasing your Versatility by 179. Moving instead grants you Uprooted, healing you for 259 every 1 second.<br />
Apothecary’s Concoctions: Your damaging abilities have a chance to deal 1,262 Plague damage over 6 seconds, and your healing abilities have a chance to restore 2,415 health over 6 seconds. These effects are increased by up to 100% based on the target’s missing health.<br />
Endless Hunger: Your Versatility is increased by 179. Moving near an enemy’s corpse consumes their essence, restoring 1,815 health. <br />
Shadow of Elune: Your spells and abilities have a chance to increase your Haste by 465 for 15 seconds. At night, you also gain 10% movement speed for the duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
HEART OF AZEROTH LEVELING AND GEARING UP<br />
Reaching Friendly, Honored, or Revered reputation with the Champions of Azeroth faction now unlocks the appropriate quests to upgrade your Heart of Azeroth for all characters on your account. <br />
<br />
The cost to change Azerite traits has been reduced from 72 hours to 24 hours.<br />
<br />
We’ve also added a new way for players who participate in Mythic Keystone Dungeons to gain specific Azerite Armor. These players will be able to earn a new currency—Titan Residuum—which can be used to purchase specific items from Thaumaturge Vashreen now located in either Zuldazar or Boralus. You can read more in our forum post (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/mythic-azerite-armor-improvements/18517).<br />

It's taking them an absurd amount of time to release them, and it's becoming ever-apparent that they are being reserved with hopes of reigniting interest into an otherwise dying expansion.<br />
<br />
The player-base is wilting, and they're going to wait until it's too late. The longer people stay unsubbed, the easier it will be for them to just forget about WoW altogether.<br />
<br />
I'm not defending it, I'm just sick of people asking where they are, we know where and when they are. They should have been released months ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've been releasing them everytime there's something new coming to the game since Legion. Why would they stop because people didn't like something about the previous one. This helps to communicate to even the most casual player(the one that doesn't read patch notes or game news) what new stuff is coming.<br />
<br />
As for previous video dislikes, people didn't dislake the video, they disliked the fact that patch didn't come with the season 2 right away.</div></div><hr />

1.) They always told people Zandalari and KT would come later in the expansion.<br />
2.) if someone isn't interested in any of the content of WoW how would a race reignite anything.<br />
3.) Constantly bemoaning about how WoW s dying is just idiocy.</div></div><hr />

Hit the nail on the head, and so very true there is no chance in hell of any sort of coherent discourse, that isn't 24/7 whinging, bitching and moaning about the most trivial of things on this site these days.. <br />

As one poster asked how much salt would be in this thread, to that I would say enough salt to supply the entire population of this planet for the next 1000 years..<br />

What do they have to test, actually ? Numbers on the passives ? Who cares, that can be hotfixed in a second.<br />

There are many things going south with WoW, but deleting PvP vendors to facilitate the grand casino that is PvE is the most blatant beacon of abject corporate greed that has festered in every corner of WoW. What started out as an entirely anticipated peak of greed in Legion, that some saw coming years ahead of time, is now almost a symbol of greed for me that I am having a harder and harder time tolerating. <br />
<br />
I've always tried to warn people when I saw the game move in this kind of direction, but now I honestly think we might be at a point of no return where no amount of community enlightenment or frustrated feedback will get the game back to a state of decency. Sacrificing PvP so willingly and stubbornly is very telling, I would assume even to the less critical thinkers. You let this creep up over the years, and now here we are. I hope you enjoy gambling. <br />

The game is in a sorry state - we know. People are quitting en masse - we know. Blizzard doesn't care - we know. Try to be objective despite that. If they make something good then admit it, if they make a shitty decision - go ham on it.<br />

<br />
The player-base is wilting, and they're going to wait until it's too late. The longer people stay unsubbed, the easier it will be for them to just forget about WoW altogether.<br />
<br />
except we wernt baited<br />
kultiran were not a confirmed allied race till launch<br />
and zandalari were said to come some time after launch.<br />
we were never &quot;baited&quot; with these two races./<br />

new azerite traits and ring<br />

sooner the neck opens up new powers the better, Suspect that's when BFA finally turns the corner.<br />

you do know the entire azerite rework is coming in 8.2 right? <br />

saying &quot;my son enjoys fortnite but gets bored by this game&quot; does not mean a game is bad, that prob means it is the opposite.<br />
i think you took a <br />
<br />
&quot;My friend says gordon ramsay's food is shit, and he eats raw sausage meat dipped in pickle juice and mayo, so you know it must be bad&quot;<br />
also really anthem? it isnt even out yet, and their trailers have been nothing but cringe.<br />
also notice how none of those games you mention are MMORPG?<br />
maybe your son just idk... does not like MMORPG?<br />
you cant compare games from different genres, because games may be a million time better then another, but because of the genre someone will like one more then the other.<br />

you mean how they have had to test every race before in the entire history of wow?<br />
also those patch trailers have been replaced with more ingame cinematics, because those trailers were usually just ingame video of the raid.<br />

I'm sorry, but while the systems being meh in BFA is the developers fault, the expansion releasing earlier than it should is the whiners fault, countless posts in legion about &quot;omg and there will be content drought again, you will see, no expansion until december, release it earlier blizzard omg!!&quot; and a lot of titles and comments just like this one, are what made them try to please this toxic community, with so much whinning and disliking and being so unpolite and stupid, what people will achieve in 2 years is blizzard saying &quot;we are sorry, no matter what we try and apologize for our mistakes you shit on all we do, so wow is cancelled, we are sick of this&quot; and the game this toxic people &quot;love&quot; wait &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;love&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; will come to an end, and that will be the fault of the developers and the community, BOTH.<br />
<br />
there is a difference in negative feedback, constructive criticism and being a dick at everything blizzard does, just for the sake of it, and don't deny that there are a lot of people like that, as much as there are people who will say BFA is perfect when is not.</div></div><hr />

Because of raiding? hmm then, if they release a survival guide for classic should the people who not like raiding give it as much dislikes?<br />

I won't play classic, I don't have the time and I don't like some things about it. So, because of that should I hit that delicius dislike button? would it be fair? I don't think it is, and I would never do that. The content they talk about in that video is good, except azerite, that video doesn't deserve the many dislikes it has, that just proves that we are certainly in a trend of hate, i'm sure at least 25% of those dislikes are from people who didn't even see it before pressing the button.</div></div><hr />

No, because they lowered the bar they set with Legion. I only did a few LFRs in legion but I was never bored and i had lots to do to keep me amused. Getting all my alts through the class quests was a joy. In bfa everything is a chore. If you don't raid there is precious little new for you to do.</div></div><hr />

Well, there's the whole M+ season with a new major affix and the new pvp season and the new azerite ring with some really interesting traits for each class. There is enough to do in general, but it seems it's for activities you don't enjoy. :eek:<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to it, because I'm a casual heroic raider and I like m+ (though I'm not one of the high key pushers).</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying it's a main reason. But it is a minor one. I just want to be a Kul Tiran Druid. It's one of the few race/class combos I've wanted in this game for years is Human Druid. Only other 2 were Gnome Priest and Hunter.<br />
<br />
And seriously grow up. Telling people not to come back and comparing them to a terminal illness is downright pitiful. I don't care what someones opinion of a game is good or bad. Comparing them to cancer is just disgusting and petulant.<br />
<br />
I partly agree with the allied races criticism in a way. They were hyped up as a big one for this expansion and they have yet to be seen. Imo they should be available the minute the raid is finished imo. Provided you meet all the criteria.</div></div><hr />

That isn't even remotely close to reality... The expansion was released before it was complete because Activision are greedy fucks who wanted to make their quarterly quota. They've been pulling this stunt for years with all their titles. You're delusional if you think :whiny players&quot; had even an ounce of influence over the game's release, since that decision goes waaaaaay above any of us.

i have not the slightest problem with ppl complaining about the missing allied races. totally no offense here.<br />
<br />
but base the descission if you play this game or not on allied races, is just hillarious. i mean, what are this for ppl ? what is their reason to play wow, when it just depends on a model ? how will be that ppl any good for the game ? they give blizzard money for some stupid cheap model shit and show them they just do not have to make a good game.<br />
<br />
and for the guy above: what content should i expect that this players will paticipate in ? WQs ? LFR ? i dont need them to play the game there. its solo content. what the hell should be the win for the health of that (as guy mentioned) MMO, when they at best do some WQs and hop around with their new model for 1-2 months subbed and then leave forever ?<br />
<br />
ppl like Eleccybubb, that ALSO wants their models, TOTALLY no offense and problem at all. complains are justified. but to only play the game when that models are available makes zero sense and this type of ppls are not good for the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL the dislike on the video have nothing to do with the content on the patch. <br />
<br />
Bc litterally with minor diferences the patch cycle so far on BFA is the same as Legion. <br />
<br />
The ppl that dislike the video, like 70% dont event watch it they just do it bc &quot;hate something&quot; is the new hister thing to do on internet. <br />

Class halls has been one of the best things blizzard has done, and I agree at some point with you (trowing random %, about 80% hahaha)<br />

<br />
They were announced to be in the game at the Blizzcon before the Blizzcon you mentioned. Stop whiteknighting, they are just cash grabbers now. I won't play the game again until the end of the expac, where I will do all content they added in a year, in 2 days</div></div><hr />

In your world full of hating ofc it's just like you are saying, and not a combination of activision and them wanting to pelase the people who asked for a shorter content drought. Ofc activision behind, and blizzard also wants money, that's true and they will do some werid shit from time to time to bring more money, like all big companies. blizzard could make millions of changes trying to do something for wow, and they only thing you would read/hear is &quot;MAU MAU MAU&quot; &quot;CASH GRAB CASH GRAB&quot; &quot;PHONES PHONES PHONES&quot; because over the years it seems they created spoiled fanboys who turned into the avatars of the new hate, the new revolution!. <br />

And they said they would come in 8.0, right? right!!!, no.<br />
<br />
Oh man, enough of your excuses, if we did not have datamining, forums and a lot more information on the internet, then yeah, blizzard cash grab assholes! they did not tell us the zandalari wouldn't be on 8.0 (they did, before the expansion even came out) and we couldn't look for it because there is no information and I bought the game and paid a subscription!!.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are truly evil, I see it now, they are taking advantage of people who can't read and look for information on something, buying blindly their game so they could take the cash of those people, man they are genius level of evil.<br />
<br />
EDIT: What I can agree on is that they delayed the races to almost mid expansion so they could have more people subscribed just before 8.2, that is the BIG patch and the one they need to be loved, but that they took the money of those people and lied? what money? the one they decided to use knowing what they would get?, then that's the fault of those people, blizzard did not take the money.<br />

There is a substantial RP community in WoW. Hence the existence of RP servers. Also, many people consider their character as an extension of them in a virtual world. It's THEM. It's their AVATAR.<br />
<br />
Who are you to judge what players find fun in this game? And yes, despite your pitiful ignorance, there are people who might hate WoW's current game systems, but find immersion on a new race/class combo. And yes, for those people (although i don't belong to them, but have met many in my WoW experience of 12 unsubbed years) new allied races are what they were expecting from this xpac. <br />
