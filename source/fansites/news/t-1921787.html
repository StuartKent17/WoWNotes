The Force Awakens in Azeroth<br />
Tonight's hotfix gives many of the Orgrimmar and Stormwind guards red and blue lightsabers, or as close as you can get in WoW!<br />

These aren’t the guards you’re looking for...<br />

Some sort of force awakens in both factions!<br />

We figured we'd pay homage to a galaxy far, far away that has long been near and dear to our geek hearts.<br />
<br />
Stop by Stormwind or Orgrimmar to pay respect to your guards and appreciate their exotic new weapons. They won't be able to maintain the unfamiliar technology for long!<br />

Patch 6.2.3 Hotfixes - Dec 16<br />
Winter Veil<br />
<br />
Players are now automatically dismounted in the area around Greatfather Winter and Winter Veil presents.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Greatly increased the spawn rates of quest objectives for the following Winter Veil quests: What Horrible Presents!, Grumpus, Menacing Grumplings, and Where are the Children?<br />
What Horrible Presents!: Spirit Bomb should no longer incorrectly cause players to become flagged for PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Recent Actions Against Botting in WoW<br />
We've recently taken action against a large number of World of Warcraft accounts that were found to be using third-party programs that automate gameplay, known as “bots.” As a part of this action, we have removed various currencies and inventory from these accounts including, but not limited to, gold, PvP currencies, and gear. The penalty for those identified as repeat offenders has also been increased.<br />
<br />
We’re committed to providing an equal and fair playing field for everyone in World of Warcraft, and will continue to take action against those found in violation of our Terms of Use. Cheating of any form will not be tolerated.<br />
<br />
If you believe that you’ve encountered a player abusing a bot, exploit, or cheat, please let us know! You can do so by using the right-click report functionality in the game, and/or by emailing information to hacks@blizzard.com.<br />

Winter Veil Spawn Rates<br />
Reports of unusual gifts not spawning and concerns over grumpling population levels have been forwarded. Hang in there folks, we won't let Grumpus ruin Winter Veil!<br />
Thanks for bringing this to our attention. The proper people were notified and unusual gifts should now be spawning correctly for the realms where it wasn't spawning correctly. Additionally, Grumpus and Menacing Grumplings' spawn rates should still be more frequent but at a more appropriate rate now.

Guild Challenge System Changes<br />
So time walking dungeons don't count then? Or is time walking considered part of this expansion so they do?<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Timewalking dungeons will no longer give guild challenge credit. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/396033-guild-challenge-system-changes/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20042936479?page=1#15))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2015-12-18, 04:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also what happened to the days when botting got you permabanned?<br />
Lore had some more to say on the subject:<br />
<br />
why only 6 months..... blizz your getting greedy<br />
<br />
So, here's the thing.<br />
<br />
Through various studies (conducted both here at Blizzard and by other companies/groups), and by monitoring player behavior, we've discovered that suspensions are actually more effective than permabans for preventing repeat offenses by the same people.<br />
<br />
There's some really interesting sociological hocus pocus behind it, but from what I understand, the TLDR is that if a botter gets permabanned, they'll often just buy a new account and go right back to botting. However, if we only suspend them -- meaning, they'll get their account back later -- they're less likely to buy a new one. Furthermore, once they do get their account back, they're EXTREMELY unlikely to bot again.<br />
<br />
I'm not a psychology expert, but there's something about &quot;I'll get this account back later&quot; that leads more of these sorts of people to give up their botting ways than if their accounts had been permanently closed. It's kind of fascinating (at least I find it to be).<br />
<br />
Side note: please avoid referencing bot programs directly by name, you're only making it easier for people to find them!<br />
<br />
<br />
So let me get this straight. You just want them to resub rather than banning players that are ruining the game? Sorry if I'm misunderstanding but to me that just seems like all blizzard cares about is cash flow.<br />
<br />
Sorry, let me try to explain more clearly:<br />
<br />
Take your average botter. Let's call him... Jim. Jim is an awful person who uses various scripts and/or third party programs to give himself an unfair advantage against other players. We don't like Jim. One day, Jim gets caught, and Blizzard takes action against his account.<br />
<br />
Now say, hypothetically, that Jim's account gets permanently closed. Everything he had on that account is now gone forever, and he has no way of getting it back. Now, many players in this case would (and do) just stop playing, but not Jim. Jim decides he still wants to play World of Warcraft, so he buys a new account and starts over fresh. And since Jim's now starting from scratch, he decides he doesn't have much to lose, so he fires up his scripts and third party programs again.<br />
<br />
Net result: Jim is still at it. If and when he gets caught again, he just buys another account, and continues to be an awful person.<br />
<br />
However, if Jim only gets a temporary suspension, he knows he's getting his account back, so starting over from scratch sounds much less appealing. Jim likes his characters and wants to keep them, so he decides to just wait the suspension out. Once it ends, he really doesn't want to go through that whole ordeal again, so he decides not to risk botting again.<br />
<br />
Net result: Jim is a decent guy who made some mistakes and learned from them. We're actually pretty okay with Jim now.<br />
<br />
I'm obviously painting a rosy picture here (not everyone responds this way), but I'm just trying to illustrate why suspending accounts tends to result in fewer cheaters long-term than permabanning. Like I said, there's some really interesting psychological shenanigans involved (which are a bit above me, I'm afraid). That's my understanding of how all this works, though.<br />
<br />
(Also, apologies to everyone named Jim who is not a filthy cheater. I'm sure you're all lovely.)<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Nice story, but that would only be true if the majority of botters are average players who once find out &quot;oh i can download a program from teh internets that does all the work for me. i go to bed and in the next morning i can buy full honor gears yay!!&quot;. And this is not the truth imho. I say, the absolute majority of botters come from commercial sites who sell the stuff they farm for real money. This is a fuckn business model where the only thing that matters is costs vs. profit. When you permaban those guys Blizzard would at least somewhat threat their profits as botters needs to by new accounts, level up new bot toons etc.<br />
<br />
Sorry but its so damn unrealistic that normal Jim guy buys new accounts over and over again when he gets caught for cheating. After a permaban, normal Jim would either buy a new account ONCE and never cheat again (perfect result achieved) or he deletes the game and plays/cheats something else (minus 1 botter).<br />
<br />
Its just obvious, botters and cheaters bring money, and the only thing Blizzard does is to limit it to a certain extend so it does not get too annoying for the regular playerbase.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone else see a contradiction there?<br />

<br />

<br />
(Also, apologies to everyone named Jim who is not a filthy cheater. I'm sure you're all lovely.)<br />
<br />
If you permaban, they might keep cheating via a new account. If you temp ban, they might keep cheating after temp ban has been lifted...<br />
<br />
Or even between the same post:<br />
<br />
Now, many players in this case would (and do) just stop playing<br />
<br />
but I'm just trying to illustrate why suspending accounts tends to result in fewer cheaters long-term than permabanning. <br />
<br />
If you permaban people, they either stop playing (cool for me) or they get a new account and 1.keep botting (which can also happen when they get temp banned) or 2. They don't bot anymore.<br />
<br />
If you temporary ban people, they either wait (lol, as if those people waited 6 months without playing... Either they quit playing or bought a new account) and:<br />
1. They've learned the lesson<br />
2. They keep botting.<br />
<br />
To me, this justification is just plain retarded. If you ban players and learn the lesson and want to keep playing, they'll buy a new account and never bot again. If you ban players and they don't want to keep playing even if they've learned the lesson, then too bad for blizzard, better luck with next player gen. If you temp ban players, they don't learn the lesson, and keep botting, you're just being ridiculized by them.<br />
<br />
Permabans can result in:<br />
1. Player quitting.<br />
2. Player buying a new account and keep botting.<br />
3. Player buying a new account and never botting again.<br />
<br />
Temp bans can result in:<br />
1. Player learning from it.<br />
2. Player not learning from it.<br />
<br />
Chances are there. By permabanning people, you have 66.67% chances he won't bot again. By tempbanning them, you have 50% chances.<br />
<br />
Btw, EU spanish forums got a post of a &quot;Temp banned player who didn't learn from it&quot; case where he got banned AGAIN (will he learn from it after this second chance or he'll keep botting? I should ask that forum mod's opinion), and posted a conversation with a GM with a &quot;tee bots uso&quot; folder on the desktop. Just plain hilarious:<br />

These bot 'ban waves' are a joke. If blizzard really thinks the majority of people bot on precious 10 year old accounts they are completely mad. Anyone with half a brain buys a 15 euro account or buys an account from the nearest Chinese for some gold, buys gametime with gold, installs a virtual machine with a VPN and automates everything so all they need to do is grab their millions from the guildbank every once in a while with their main account. Getting banned? Buy a new account from your friendly Chinese next door, insert new username and password and within 5 minutes you're up and running again.<br />
<br />
Nah I remember good old times when I would see a person using a flyhack to mine underneath the floor in wintergrasp. I made a ticket and 5 minutes later a GM spawned next to me to check out what I meant. After 5 minutes of following him around and veins disappearing out of nowhere infront of us the GM whispered me and said 'you don't need to worry about this guy again'. A simple /who confirmed he disappeared. Within 10 minutes I was happily back to mining in wintergrasp without having to worry about cheaters. Those were good times. Times when customer support actually had manpower instead of automated answers. Times when you actually felt like a loved customer instead of a sack of money that needs to be squeezed. Blizzard can easily reduce the problem of bots by far more as they currently do. All they need to do is invest into some manpower. Apparently it's not worth it for them.</div></div><hr />

Shock horror. A business wanting to make money so brings back items they know people will buy. Also the DD stuff is hardly anything prestigious it just means you are willing to open your wallet more.<br />
<br />
Wasn't it just that it was a little unfair that it ended early, without any warning during the blizzcon announcement? MoP DD rewards were available right til the end too?</div></div><hr />

Jim, will not be botting on his main account but he will be botting on his throwaway account. When that account is banned, he will just get another one.<br />
<br />
What they need to do is make some sort of system where they ban one of your computer part id's. You wont know which id that gets banned and basicaly have to replace parts in your computer to be able to play again. Buying a new account everytime you get banned is easy, new graphic card (maybe) is not</div></div><hr />

For sure I agree with you there on the whole ending early thing which is why they brought it back. They know people will buy this for the rewards. And yes it should be available till the end of WoD and tbh as a singular package. It doesn't hurt anyone having a mount and a pet that loads of people already have. And anyone claiming the whole &quot;but mah prestigiousness&quot; argument is just a fool.</div></div><hr />

They can In my experience be put into two groups:<br />
1. People who do it for $$ in a large scale using multiple accounts (I am not talking of guys with 5 accounts but those with 20 plus accounts. Hell Ive seen one with over a 100 running 24/7)<br />
2. Random guy Joe, who instead of playing the game to its fullest extent chooses to skip the boring or mind numbing stuff and go straight to what he likes about wow.<br />
<br />
Type 1 will give Blizzard the middle finger and just buy the accounts he needs again.<br />
Type 2 well he can like Blizzard says, either keep playing on a new account and wait for the ban to release itself or he can wait it out to quit.<br />
<br />
Blizzard hit Bossland &amp; thereby Honorbuddy hard this time, by using from what I can gather from the latest intel illegal activity towards what is running on their users machines. Blizzard went out and hired an employe of Bosslands and had him give them the source code (intellectual property) of Honorbuddy. The legal fight that will come out of it, will just continue.<br />
<br />
Now, what profounds me is that Blizzard never really asks why Type 2, is botting ? Could it be that the person after 10 plus years have grown tired of having to play this game 8 plus hours a day to compete ? Spamming buttons endlessly to be the best dos he can be at his ilvl ? As I see it, botting is all about convenience, and taking wow to the level of play, where that individual player wants it to go. Now this should give Blizzard food for thought, and it might explain why the MMO scene is dwindling away, like the dinosaurs to become extinct eventually instead of evolving.</div></div><hr />

Like I said, there's some really interesting psychological shenanigans involved (which are a bit above me, I'm afraid). That's my understanding of how all this works, though.<br />
<br />
Nice story, but that would only be true if the majority of botters are average players who once find out &quot;oh i can download a program from teh internets that does all the work for me. i go to bed and in the next morning i can buy full honor gears yay!!&quot;. And this is not the truth imho. I say, the absolute majority of botters come from commercial sites who sell the stuff they farm for real money. This is a fuckn business model where the only thing that matters is costs vs. profit. When you permaban those guys Blizzard would at least somewhat threat their profits as botters needs to by new accounts, level up new bot toons etc.<br />
<br />
Sorry but its so damn unrealistic that normal Jim guy buys new accounts over and over again when he gets caught for cheating. After a permaban, normal Jim would either buy a new account ONCE and never cheat again (perfect result achieved) or he deletes the game and plays/cheats something else (minus 1 botter).<br />
<br />
Its just obvious, botters and cheaters bring money, and the only thing Blizzard does is to limit it to a certain extend so it does not get too annoying for the regular playerbase.<br />
<br />
That is so true dude, Since they already know that they will not get banned and will just get everything they got wiped... they will keep doing it and it will be easier for them cause they already got a max lvl character, if Blizzard ban them at least will make then waste time!, So that answer that blizzard gave was just stupid.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilgaladus</div><div class="date">2015-12-18, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point is this, &quot;Jim&quot; and his 10 year old WoW account hardly exist in the botting community.<br />
<br />
TL:DR Hi I'm Jim, I'm still at it and yes I am an awful person :)<br />
<br />
You are not a &quot;community&quot;. I don't think you know what the word community means, but you are the antithesis of that. Subhuman garbage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nodq</div><div class="date">2015-12-18, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Now say, hypothetically, that Jim's account gets permanently closed. Everything he had on that account is now gone forever, and he has no way of getting it back. Now, many players in this case would (and do) just stop playing, but not Jim. Jim decides he still wants to play World of Warcraft, so he buys a new account and starts over fresh. And since Jim's now starting from scratch, he decides he doesn't have much to lose, so he fires up his scripts and third party programs again.&quot;<br />
<br />
I understand that kind of logic, but in reality it doesn't work out. As i watched lots of streams last days since the ban wave happened, and all those ppl that were banned for 6 months just boosted another toon to play with for the next 6 months. 6 months is so long that it is almost like the account is gone forever. As if someone would sit there and wait until those 6 months are over. And do you really thing those people will not cheat again? They know that those banwaves happen like every 6 or more months. And thats the core problem, now they can cheat for free the next like 6 months without anything happen to their actions. And then, when their new account is banned... their old / original first banned account is av. again. Whats the point other than that Blizzard makes lots of money because of the 50 bucks for boosting a new character for those cheaters + the usual monthly fee as nothing happend. <br />
<br />
Sorry but if Blizzard is not capable of taking actions against cheaters in a trimeframe like 1-3 weeks for those botters, anything else is useless and meaningless for sure. When a cheater KNOWS, he could be banned like 2 wees after he started cheating, then they would actually think about it TWICE before doing it, because thats a lot of money for just some weeks, and in that time you can not get to max level equip your toon and all that to make all the shit you want to do, like PvP for example just so that when u finished doing that, that you would have to buy a new account again... etc. <br />
<br />

<br />
agree. it has to be short enough that your throwaway account you use for botting costs more than you make while botting, only way to stop it. with banwave every 6 months ppl just go 'whatever' buy another account and go at it again</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it's appropriate, Lucas is the one who glommed onto the whole movie-tie in thing with the original Star Wars, he sold merch rights to anyone with an idea and a couple of bucks to fund the movie - and proceeded to make a bigger mountain of money from merch over the years than the films did. Star Wars has always had a stench of crass commercialization around them, every time one came out we had a barrage of consumer crap foisted on us. Hell, he designed characters to sell more cheap shit, like the Ewoks. <br />
<br />
I like the first 3 Star Wars movies well enough. Not a huge fan of the prequels. They're pretty and have lots of boomy noises and flashy lights, but I find them pretty stiff to be honest. I watched them with some nieces and nephews over thanksgiving, I was amused that they loved the first 3, and wandered off during the first prequel because &quot;it was boring&quot;. I'll watch the new one eventually. Not really that into it - same with Star Trek - I'll check out the new movie, because I liked the latest Star Trek reboots more than the Star Wars prequels, but I'm not killing myself to see it. <br />
<br />
I've never been in either camp, as a hardcore fan, I know in a month the marketing buys for Star Wars will start to taper off, and we can all relax. Let them have their brief moment when their obsession is actually trendy - then they can go back to shutting the fuck up about it.</div></div><hr />

0$. They don't reference the name at all, and only have weapons that look like lightsabers, that won't get them sued for copyright infringement. They're not advertising it in any real way at all, it's just a salute towards that franchise.<br />

Any Blizzard employee who reads this will be able to do zip to help you - they don't know who you are, and have no official presence here. You are quite literally wasting your time. <br />
<br />
If you got banned, the email you got tells you the only way to contact them. If they don't respond, tough luck.<br />

PS - combat rotations from that bot company can get you banned, too. A perm-ban on a false negative? Doesn't happen anymore. You were doing something bad, or someone using your account did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why only 6 months..... blizz your getting greedy<br />
<br />
So, here's the thing.<br />
<br />
Through various studies (conducted both here at Blizzard and by other companies/groups), and by monitoring player behavior, we've discovered that suspensions are actually more effective than permabans for preventing repeat offenses by the same people.<br />
<br />
There's some really interesting sociological hocus pocus behind it, but from what I understand, the TLDR is that if a botter gets permabanned, they'll often just buy a new account and go right back to botting. However, if we only suspend them -- meaning, they'll get their account back later -- they're less likely to buy a new one. Furthermore, once they do get their account back, they're EXTREMELY unlikely to bot again.<br />
<br />
I'm not a psychology expert, but there's something about &quot;I'll get this account back later&quot; that leads more of these sorts of people to give up their botting ways than if their accounts had been permanently closed. It's kind of fascinating (at least I find it to be).<br />
<br />
Side note: please avoid referencing bot programs directly by name, you're only making it easier for people to find them!<br />
<br />
<br />
So let me get this straight. You just want them to resub rather than banning players that are ruining the game? Sorry if I'm misunderstanding but to me that just seems like all blizzard cares about is cash flow.<br />
<br />
Sorry, let me try to explain more clearly:<br />
<br />
Take your average botter. Let's call him... Jim. Jim is an awful person who uses various scripts and/or third party programs to give himself an unfair advantage against other players. We don't like Jim. One day, Jim gets caught, and Blizzard takes action against his account.<br />
<br />
Now say, hypothetically, that Jim's account gets permanently closed. Everything he had on that account is now gone forever, and he has no way of getting it back. Now, many players in this case would (and do) just stop playing, but not Jim. Jim decides he still wants to play World of Warcraft, so he buys a new account and starts over fresh. And since Jim's now starting from scratch, he decides he doesn't have much to lose, so he fires up his scripts and third party programs again.<br />
<br />
Net result: Jim is still at it. If and when he gets caught again, he just buys another account, and continues to be an awful person.<br />
<br />
However, if Jim only gets a temporary suspension, he knows he's getting his account back, so starting over from scratch sounds much less appealing. Jim likes his characters and wants to keep them, so he decides to just wait the suspension out. Once it ends, he really doesn't want to go through that whole ordeal again, so he decides not to risk botting again.<br />
<br />
Net result: Jim is a decent guy who made some mistakes and learned from them. We're actually pretty okay with Jim now.<br />
<br />
I'm obviously painting a rosy picture here (not everyone responds this way), but I'm just trying to illustrate why suspending accounts tends to result in fewer cheaters long-term than permabanning. Like I said, there's some really interesting psychological shenanigans involved (which are a bit above me, I'm afraid). That's my understanding of how all this works, though.<br />
<br />
(Also, apologies to everyone named Jim who is not a filthy cheater. I'm sure you're all lovely.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As neat as it is seeing the city guards with lightsabers, I'm ready for a break from all the Star Wars saturation as well.<br />
<br />
Lore has a tendency to be a Blizzard fanboi and to defend them at all and any costs. His first month was his first and only honest month. After that... well... he realized not to bite the hand that feeds him.</div></div><hr />

I'd say this was a full expansion penalty, which means no friends for a year and a half. Obviously the 6 month timeout wasn't strong enough, so temp-ban with extra strength seems like a good idea on the surface, and the game is well past it's prime, so this all seems reasonable.</div></div><hr />

Old post but.<br />
<br />
1. This works, for 10 minutes, then I could either buy a new account (or steal one)<br />
2. This does nothing, many ISPs offer dynamic ip addressing, I'd have a new IP within a minute.<br />
3. This also doesn't work because of 1, has the negative side affect of blocking legit customers as many people use VPN/tunnelling to help with poor pings internationally.</div></div><hr />
