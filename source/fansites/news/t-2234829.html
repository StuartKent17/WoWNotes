Chromie needs your help to stop her death! In this solo scenario, you will defeat eight different attacks on Chromie throughout time before it is too late. Rewards include Timewarped Badges (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1166-timewarped-badge), the Timelord (http://ptr.wowdb.com/titles/510-timelord) title, and transmog gear. <br />
<br />
<br />
Head to Wyrmrest Temple to find Chromie. <br />
You will have to run this scenario a number of times to farm reputation to unlock Chromie's talents, unlock the Chronoportals, and learn how to beat it in time.<br />
You have 15 minutes (plus whatever bonus time you can collect) to stop all eight attacks on Chromie. <br />
Completing the scenario in time rewards the Chromie themed armor set transmog. <br />
You will have an item level of 1000 and player level of 112. <br />
You will have to do a slow clear of each Dragonshrine once to unlock the other four situations that Chromie needs to be saved from. <br />
The chests that Chromie will reveal on the map with a talent are also present without the talent, so keep an eye out for them. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Video<br />
This video shows a lucky and relatively relaxed run with full talents. If you are lucky or try to significantly optimize your route and gameplay, you may be able to complete the scenario in time without the full set of talents. <br />

Chromie's Talents<br />
Chromie has seven tiers of talents, with a higher reputation level needed for each one. Tiers 3-7 take time to research and each tier must be researched before moving on to the next. You can chain run the scenario to farm reputation, allowing you to reach max reputation far before you will be able to research all of the talents. You will be able to swap between talents instantly after researching that tier. <br />
<br />

Sands of Time<br />
There is a chance to find Sands of Time (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151493-sands-of-time) on enemy corpses, as quest rewards, and from chests. The item allows you to choose from one of two rewards to make the scenario a little bit easier. Generally the priority for your choice should be Keepsake Box or Bronze Drake, Stolen Time, followed by the rest. Currently damage reduction isn't very necessary, even for cloth casters.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that once a choice is presented, it doesn't change. This can be useful in giving you a little bit of control over the rewards. For example, if you have only cleared one Dragonshrine and get a Bronze Drake as an option, go ahead and clear two more before selecting the drake so that you can use it on the far away final shrine. The same goes for getting a Keepsake box near the end of one of the Chronoportals. Don't make the choice until after you complete that Chronoportal, otherwise you could get one for the current portal you are almost finished with! <br />
<br />
<br />
Time-Lost Keepsake Box (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151554-time-lost-keepsake-box) - Grants an item that allows you to quickly complete one of the Chronoportal challenges.<br />

Stolen Time (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/247007-stolen-time) - Grants 10, 20, or 30 extra seconds to complete the scenario.<br />
Favor of the Bronze (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/246835-favor-of-the-bronze) - Grants 25% increased reputation with Chromie in the scenario. This buff stacks.<br />
Wings of the Bronze (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/246832-wings-of-the-bronze) - Increase run speed by 10% while in the Deaths of Chromie scenario, stacking up to 10 times.<br />
Hide of the Bronze (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/246831-hide-of-the-bronze) - Reduce damage taken by 10% while in the Deaths of Chromie scenario, stacking up to 9 times.<br />

<br />
<br />
Dragonshrines<br />
After completing the tasks to reveal the boss at each Dragonshrine, you will be able to head directly to the boss's location in future runs of the scenario, saving significant time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Emerald Dragonshrine<br />
<br />
Kill Emerald Skytalon (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/122548-emerald-skytalon) to gather 24 x Emeraldine Plume (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151168-emeraldine-plume)<br />

Head to the skeleton's claw by the water to reveal Thalas Vylethorn (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/122875-thalas-vylethorn)<br />
<br />
Azure Dragonshrine<br />
<br />
Kill Leyline Elemental (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/122552-leyline-elemental) and Ley Wyrm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/122551-ley-wyrm) to gather 50 x Darkened Scrap of Vellum (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151141-darkened-scrap-of-vellum)<br />
Head to the eastern floating platform to reveal the Void Gargantuan (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/122553-void-gargantuan)<br />
<br />
Ruby Dragonshrine<br />
<br />
Kill the undead leaders at the entrances to the Dragonshrine to gather Soul Crystal Fragment (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/150939-soul-crystal-fragment).<br />
Head to the space under the tree to reveal the Talar Icechill (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/122874-talar-icechill)<br />
<br />
Obsidian Dragonshrine<br />
<br />
Say hi to Wrathion outside.<br />
Fight your way to the back of the cave to kill Charredbone Goliath (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/122528-charredbone-goliath)<br />
Head outside by the entrance to reveal Zorathides (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/122871-zorathides)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Chronoportals<br />
There are four Chronoportals that are unlocked after you complete one of the corresponding Dragonshrines for the first time. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mount Hyjal<br />
<br />
Run up to the injured Chromie, fight off the waves of attackers, defeat the Fiery Behemoth (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/123021-fiery-behemoth)<br />
If you have a Brimstone Beacon (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151547-brimstone-beacon), you can skip right to the boss. <br />
<br />
War for Andorhal<br />
<br />
Pick up the quest from Chromie and then head to the Alliance side of the battlefield to kill NPCs. Useful NPCs are marked with a star on the mini-map.<br />
<br />
Alliance Force-Commander (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/124072-alliance-force-commander) - Drops Sands of Time (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151493-sands-of-time)<br />
Gatzin Zapwrench (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/124095-gatzin-zapwrench) - Drops Lightning Absorption Capsule (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151369-lightning-absorption-capsule), which is necessary to take down the cannon.<br />
Potionmaster Donovan (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/124094-potionmaster-donovan) - Drops Experimental Alchemy Reagent (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151368-experimental-alchemy-reagent), which is necessary to take down the cannon<br />
Other named NPCs can drop Military Explosives (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151370-military-explosives), which take 15% health off of the cannon<br />
<br />
Take down the plating and electrical shield on the cannon, then use the explosives to destroy it.<br />
If you have Cenarion Circle Documents (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/151549-cenarion-circle-documents) you can skip killing the cannon. <br />
<br />
The Well of Eternity<br />
<br />
Mount up and ride along the edge of the well down the path to the portal. You will have to kill anything you pulled before being able to take the portal, including the Felhound that gets sent chasing you. <br />
Mount up, follow the path back towards where you normally enter the instance. Don't dismount until you come across Grolethax (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/123721-grolethax). Be sure Chromie is next to you and around the corner against the invisible wall to line of sight the caster NPCs.<br />
After killing everything to drop combat, take the portal out. If you don't drop combat, sometimes you are stuck in combat and can no longer mount for the rest of the scenario. <br />
<br />
Culling of Stratholme<br />
<br />
This is an ideal Chronoportal to be able to skip, as it can take up to seven minutes without speed buffs.<br />
Head into the city and pick up Smoke, Meat, and Pretty Flowers (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/47744-smoke-meat-and-pretty-flowers) from Emery Neill (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/123781-emery-neill)<br />
Purchase all of the special scenario items from the shop vendors. You will probably make two trips the first time through, as the followup quest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/47746-holing-up) sends you to buy other things from the same shops.<br />
Take the Town Hall key, run up to the hidden bookcase, and run through the streets along the normal instance path. Be sure to pull the casters so they aren't pulled by Chromie and kill her. <br />
Kill Nezar'Azret (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/123836-nezarazret), free Chromie, and move on!</div></div><hr />

It's not even Mythic looking. It's just HD upscales of Hour of Twilight dungeon sets. It's a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah so do I. And had they kept with that model other more appealing MMOs would have wiped the floor with them. :) But there's a thread in general to discuss what people believe are WoWs glory days so I'll leave it at this.<br />
<br />
Also they could have easily designed unique armor sets for this. But no they went lazy mode and just thought &quot;oh let's upscale the 4.3 dungeon pieces to HD, nobody will notice&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It's not upscaled, it's a recolor. And it's not suposed to be &quot;oh, nobody will notice&quot;, it's a time traveling scenario with a new color of classic gear from different times of the game. And please, the content is the scenario, which is fun and engaging and definitively not lazy for a small patch (this is NOT a big content patch). So please, don't even try to convince me on thate salty &quot;blizzard never does anything good&quot; rhetoric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where did I say they never do anything good or that this content patch was massive? Don't put words in my mouth please. The gear is lazy. It's upscaled and recoloured. Go look at the 4.3 dungeons and tell me it's not upscaled in terms of texture quality. Stop making excuses for their laziness like &quot;classic gear from different times&quot;. It's a poor excuse at best and defending them for laziness. <br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to BT timewalking although I'm expecting it to be faceroll and I'm looking forward to Tomb of Sargeras. 7.2.5 brings some amazing stuff but this scenario is meager at best.

You have problems. This isn't Tumblr so give it a rest. You can't even construct a decent reply so you're making baby noises and wishing cancer? Man, sad sad sad.<br />
<br />
What has been said is simple enough. Time and money has been put in this new content, but the rewards are weak. How many times can we repeat an event until it is no longer 'fun'? Would we re-do M+ and Withered Scenarios if all it had for it was 'fun'? Fun is enjoyed the first few times. Are we still doing WQs for 'fun' ater the first two months? No, because it had rewards we cared for. It's been pointed out. It's lazy. Old already existing low res mogs? It's Trial of Style all over again. At least Trial of Style might have its rewards upgraded, but I doubt Chromie will<br />
<br />
Now if you don't care about time and money being poured into projects with very limited life spans that is fine too, baby noises and cancer wishing and all. The rest of us will just keep on shaking our heads and trying to remember that Blizz is a multi million company and in theory they aren't amateurs.<br />

P.S. I really miss GW2's approach to cosmetics. I don't need or want all content to drop 'epix', I have raids for that. But more skins would never be a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also they could have easily designed unique armor sets for this. But no they went lazy mode and just thought &quot;oh let's upscale the 4.3 dungeon pieces to HD, nobody will notice&quot;.<br />
<br />
That is strange, it seems like the most popular expansions in the series were like that and that was when WoW was really crushing the competition, instead of kind of crushing the competition. Could it be that players are so over-rewarded in this game now that the mere thought of just playing the goddamn game is confusing?</div></div><hr />

Good thing the whole thread revolves around people complaining how they just copy pasted a low res old mog for a reward and called it a day.<br />

<br />
So what if they copy pasted a transmog and recolored it, you know it makes sense that they chose that set as you know, the Cata End-time dungeon was a similar setting, you stop a future version of nozdormu, chromie is a bronze dragon too, and having a bronze-ish colored version fits the bronze theme.<br />

<br />
Rewards<br />
Chromie themed transmog sets - Ensemble: Chronoscryer's Finery, Ensemble: Epoch Sentinel's Mail, Ensemble: Riftscarred Vestments, Ensemble: Timewarden's Plate<br />
The Timelord title from Chromie Homie<br />
Bronze Proto-Whelp and Ageless Bronze Drake from Time-Lost Wallet<br />
Timewarped Badges and Gold<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tier 4 - 1 Day Research<br />
Insight - Chromie reveals nearby treasure chests.<br />
Blessing of the Bronze Dragonflight - Greater chance to earn Bronze Drake from Sands of Time, instantly clearing a dragonshrine.<br />
Bonus - Damage and healing increased by 10%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sands of time rewards:<br />
Bronze Drake - Allows you to complete one of the Dragonshrines instantly.<br />
Favor of the Bronze - Grants 25% increased reputation with Chromie in the scenario. This buff stacks.<br />
Wings of the Bronze - Increase run speed by 10% while in the Deaths of Chromie scenario, stacking up to 10 times.<br />
Hide of the Bronze - Reduce damage taken by 10% while in the Deaths of Chromie scenario, stacking up to 9 times.<br />
Fangs of the Bronze - Increase damage dealt by 10% while in the Deaths of Chromie scenario. This buff stacks.<br />
<br />
The Transmog sets are clearly Bronze colored<br />
<br />
If we had a similar scenario in the future, we'd probably get another cosmetic recolor, as people keep complaining &quot;why did they put soo many hours into making this scenario with, a unique 3d model set for this 1 silly scenario&quot; , recoloring is a lot quicker.<br />
<br />
Tbh while tier 20 looks great overall, Tier 21 should be new and unique again. <br />
<br />
But I still expect them to recolor it 4 times for LFR/Normal/Horde/Alliance, + Mythic/Elite sets. Along with 2 Combatant color (1 per faction), 1 WQ recolor, and 1 Dungeon recolor, and maybe some special WQ recolor we only get for Invasions right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get what you are saying, man. Unlike some others in this thread I I can see your point of view and accept it. You are ok with the rewards and think them thematic and appropriate. <br />
<br />
But now lets zoom back a bit from this narrow point and try to encompass the whole. Look at all the recolours in the game. The first invasons came. We got gear and we could purchase the mog. It's a recolor of an existing set. The 'it's a call out to the old epic sets' that comes in ToS. It's grabbing existing armor and then tweak it some.<br />
<br />
Trial of Style? Old low res mogs. I would personally be ashamed of offering rewards like those. It would be like offering ten slot bags. Or give someone ten cents for having helped you carry something heavy. At some point it's best not to give anything than be insulting like in the ten cent example.<br />
<br />
Considering the millions Blizz earns it's really really weird how few cosmetics are added to the game. I'm not talking about epics, lets put that topic down. Everything something awards side-epics they are useless to me since I'm raiding and getting much better stuff than this side-gear. Cosmetics would be great though. Horizontal progression. Pretties, shinies, toys. Those who wants epics do raids, those who want pretties play the mini-games. Seems simple enough as a concept.<br />
<br />
The rewards that we are talking about are what add replay value. You know, it sounds like we are at odd here, but I think we're on the same side. We want the game to succeed. But some of us find that there is a big component of lazyness involved. It's like, Chromie is the job, the prpject, and they worked on it, made it look good, polished it. And then called it a day and decided it was good enough, no extra kilometer walked for the rewards.</div></div><hr />

Trial of Style is a micro-holiday. The point of it is to not feel mandatory whatsoever - things to do just for fun. If they included some new, ultra HD, super cool looking set that was totally unique, it would feel mandatory to do this rarely occurring event and a whole lot of people would be complaining (especially because your ability to earn these items is purely subjective and based on the collective opinions of your peers). The rewards for this event are fine given the intent of a micro-holiday.</div></div><hr />

The rewards for this event are fine given the intent of a micro-holiday.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've seen that argument made over the micro-holidays (not just Trial of Style, because as you pointed it it's a whole can of worms with subjective tastes in fashion and having players compete with each other. Fashion PvP :&gt; ). The devs made them too. I can understand the idea, but I hope they did not sink many man hours into it. Right now they are new and novel and I imagine people are flocking to them (at least I hope that they are). But these objectives that have no collectibles... Eeh. Again, I don't picture them having much replayability factor. <br />
<br />
Replayability is important. It's why we sink time doing raids hoping for that sweet mog or sweet mount. No one is doing them for the stats (the ever present '950 epix' the other side of the argument has brought up all on their own). I feel that the micro-holidays are a bold move in a company that prizes the man-hours devs pour into projects, but it is like old raids that do not have special skins. If we had the data for it how many are still going back to them just for the mechanics or the 'fun' factor?<br />
<br />
Now lets look at Ulduar. Even as recently as a few months back I was religiously making my weekly trips to pick the mogs from there because oh boy, even years and years later that place is a treasure cove of good looking skins. Devs, who do have the data, can look at it and say 'Well, Ulduar took X time to make, but look at this. We still have X% of the population returning there. The time spent on those skins was time well used.'<br />
<br />
I have a friend who disliked WoW but that I convinced to try it with me under the lure she could pay the sub with gold. Once I introduced her to the Mogit addon I did not tell her 'Go to Ulduar because it's great for skins'. She browsed the skins and the gushed about one of the guns, saw it came from Ulduar and the following weeks did it with her hunter, and eventually with her warrior as well once I reminded her that the warrior could unlock gun skins, until it dropped.<br />
<br />
-That- is the value of good skins and why I feel that being lazy with rewards is counter-productive for mini-games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New abilities? Use old icons.<br />
New items? Use the same icon, as on item some time ago.<br />
New stuff in new expansion? Same old artwork and icons.<br />
<br />
In the old days it wasn't to much work for the dev team to create new 2d artworks and icons. Now it is like there is one-person part-time working on this kind of stuff and makes me feel I'm overpaying for this game.<br />
<br />
I know, there are new raids, new dungs, new stuff but WHY THE HELL THEY ARE REUSING THE SAME ICONS OVER AND OVER AGAIN???!?!?!?!?!<br />

<br />
Aren't they supposed to be incentive to level and explore the world again on alts? <br />
<br />
I'll just stick to powering through dungeons and buying flying, epic flying and 310% for significantly cheaper than one tome.</div></div><hr />

Oh ya, fun it's for fun. Only this game stops being fun when there's no reward for completing content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">purebalance</div><div class="date">2017-06-15, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where did I say they never do anything good or that this content patch was massive? Don't put words in my mouth please. The gear is lazy. It's upscaled and recoloured. Go look at the 4.3 dungeons and tell me it's not upscaled in terms of texture quality. Stop making excuses for their laziness like &quot;classic gear from different times&quot;. It's a poor excuse at best and defending them for laziness. <br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to BT timewalking although I'm expecting it to be faceroll and I'm looking forward to Tomb of Sargeras. 7.2.5 brings some amazing stuff but this scenario is meager at best. But of course me saying this is bad must mean I think they never do anything good as you insinuated right? :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Funny how this isn't lazy, but DS was? This reuses way more elements than DS did.</div></div><hr />
