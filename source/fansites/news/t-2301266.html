Developers’ notes: All of the damage increases below are a combination of buffing specs that don't benefit from the Netherlight Crucible's item level increase as much as other specs, as well as tuning the specs relative to each other.<br />

Ah gotcha thanks. Is this mentioned ingame or?<br />
<br />
<br />
until chronicle, all we knew was that the titan pantheon destroyed many 'old gods' but in doing so caused the planets to die, we didn't know why that was the case and that was the reason for their imprisonment, now though they have added that the old gods are the creations of the void lords and are a physical manifestation of their power and killing them if they have infected a world soul causes the world soul to die, the only references in game are those from yogg'saron in the puzzle box toy, but as we get closer to blizzcon and the reveal for the new expansion will likely get more in game story relating to the void and all that stuff that previously was only in comics/books supplementing the game.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure about ingame, as I'm not sure if the actual in game races know about the Void Lords, other than the Ethereals and Naaru. Maybe it was mentioned in a class order questline, but I never saw one. The information can be found in the Chronicle, Volume 1.</div></div><hr />

Numerous in-game references but I can see why people would miss them because it's not quest text or something so you might not get the point if you're not paying close attention. But uh anyways, the lore is pretty well laid out especially in the Il'gynoth and Star Auger Atraeus raid encounters. Practically lays the whole story out (Malfurion practically says verbatim that the Legion is just a distraction from the real fight that lays ahead) and where things are going next. However, it also makes it clear that the races of Azeroth don't know about the Old god's masters.</div></div><hr />

The Legion, by contrast, is somehow the lesser evil.<br />
<br />
Who knows, maybe we'll end up joining up with the Legion/Sargeras to face the Void/Old Gods/etc.<br />
<br />
A good portion of the Legion served the Void and Old Gods before Sargeras pressed them into service. Now that he is gone, they'll go back to their old masters. The wildcards would be the Eredar, since their leadership will be all but gone by the end of Legion.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The God of the Deep writhes in his prison, breaking free ever so slowly. You should hurry and defeat the fallen titan... there are greater battles yet to fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
Greater than Sargeras? God of the Deep? Old god underwater and Azshara is somewhere near by?<br />
<br />
Also there was this whisper:<br />
&quot;Do the naaru speak of eternal conflict? That the entire history of your world is but a fraction of the time that has passed? Of those that came before draenei? No? &lt;short chuckle&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
Maybe not related to expansion as much as first whisper but still interesting.</div></div><hr />

Technically, we already have them with Nightborne. They look like drow, they have a Matriarch, they even have mutated spiders. :)</div></div><hr />

Actually, let me start again.<br />
<br />
1. Explain what happened to Aleria. What new powers does she have?<br />
2. Aleria's reaction and/or struggle to control what happened to her.<br />
3. The Ethereal's reaction.<br />
4. Turalyon's reaction.<br />
5. Velen's reaction.<br />
6. Illidan's reaction.<br />
7. Explain why completing an artifact that hasn't been together for tens of thousands of years, when completed, turned the ship into the one the Army of the Light was in before.<br />
8. Show us someone on board showing some sort of surprise or curiosity over what happened to the ship.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bliz just threw a bunch of 'cool' stuff at us without any explanation or reaction from anyone. Not even random NPC's gossiping among themselves. I'm all for 'woah, holy shit' moments, but at least spend the time to make others react to help explain things. Otherwise it just feels 'eh'.</div></div><hr />

Yup, this is 3rd grade storytelling with Blizzards budget.</div></div><hr />

If you talk to Alleria in the Vindicaar near the navigation console by Turalyon, there's a new dialogue option which says &quot;What happened to you at the Seat of the Triumvirate?&quot;. You guys should read it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paranitis</div><div class="date">2017-09-14, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lots of good points.<br />
<br />
The thing I was confused about was that Alleria essentially turns into a friggin DROW in the cinematic. And then when back on the ship she just her normal self. I wanted to see her with the black skin and white hair!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EyelessCrow</div><div class="date">2017-09-14, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah this was just all really confusing. She absorbs all that shadow and looks like she's a freaking negative. Then back at the ship she's normal and all &quot;Oh yeah I can just use it whenever I want, explanation over bye!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Finally!!! Every time I asked a GM when this would be fixed I got the same reply,<br />
&quot;Not Yeti&quot;</div></div><hr />
