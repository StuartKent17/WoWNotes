Transmute: Living Elements Clarification<br />
We've recently seen a few questions regarding the functionality of Transmute: Living Elements and whether or not its effects are truly random. There's definitely some behind-the-scenes magic to this particular transmute, so we wanted to provide a bit more explanation on how it works.<br />
<br />
Typically, when you use Transmute: Living Elements, you will receive 14-16 random Volatile elements (Volatile Air (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52328/volatile-air/), Volatile Earth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52327/volatile-earth/), Volatile Water (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52326/volatile-water/), or Volatile Fire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52325/volatile-fire/)) in exchange for 15 Volatile Life. If you use this transmute while in one of the new Cataclysm zones associated with the Elemental Planes, however, the element into which your Volatile Life will transform will be predetermined. For example, if you use Transmute: Living Elements while in Uldum, you will always receive Volatile Air (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52328/volatile-air/) for your efforts.<br />
<br />
Here's a list of the affected zones and their corresponding Volatile elements:<br />
<br />
<br />
Mount Hyjal: Volatile Fire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52325/volatile-fire/)<br />
Vashj'ir: Volatile Water (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52326/volatile-water/)<br />
Deepholm: Volatile Earth (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52327/volatile-earth/)<br />
Uldum: Volatile Air (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52328/volatile-air/)<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, alchemists with Transmutation specialization will always receive bonus Volatile elements when completing this transmute. The bonus will be random, though, regardless of which zone you are in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Worldbreaker Release Party<br />
Worldbreaker, the first World of Warcraft Trading Card Game set to feature Cataclysm content, releases worldwide on December 14, and stores around the worldwill host Worldbreaker Release Parties on the weekend of December 18 and 19.<br />
<br />

See you there!<br />

Blue Posts<br />
<br />
You have received the maximum amount of guild reputation allowed this week.<br />
We're in the process of developing a hotfix to resolve the issue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/142122/you-have-recieved-the-maximum-amount))<br />
<br />
Exploiters<br />
I'd recommend that in the future if you do feel like you've found a bug, or notice someone exploiting, etc. that you not attempt to start something by telling them you're reporting them. It's just going to cause you and everyone else added problems. We appreciate the report, they'll be handled appropriately, and you can move on your way knowing that we're going to take care of it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/142123/high-level-in-worgen-starting-phase))<br />
<br />
Perks for solo players<br />
Well (and I don't mean this to be condescending at all) the idea is that it's a multiplayer game and you create and foster relationships and eventually form friendships with people who were once strangers, or have friends that from real life that play with you, and adventure with them. Get enough of those together and you have a guild.<br />
<br />
If you don't like playing with other people that's a choice, and one I personally understand wholly and completely. I love being able to level in complete solitude without anyone talking to me. I enjoy it immensely. It's potentially my favorite way to play the game. At the same time I realize that the perks available are just that, perks, and are justifiably (I believe) attached to something that requires participation and work amongst groups of people. That's obviously a philosophy that drives much of the game as the best items in the game and highest end content all require groups if not highly coordinated guilds to access. So, in that way, we do purposefully build the game for the first M in MMORPG, and give some better rewards for the second one.

The reputation gain is at the correct cap, as far as I know. They are fixing the horribly obnoxious spam messages that constantly tell you that you cannot gain anymore guild reputation that day.</div></div><hr />

Well actually im in a guild with just a mate of mine and we will unlock lvl2 today so its pretty good even for extreme lowpop guild.<br />
Now all our alts etc (we do have a couple each) will get a 5% increase on xp gained just from being in the guild. while working on getting another 5% while doing so.<br />
Thats not to bad as a &quot;free&quot; bonus now is it?</div></div><hr />

Yeah I don't like it either. It looks static and out of shape. The other ones are awesome, even tho I'm not a huge fan of the anime style drawings either.</div></div><hr />

You could get a warlock to summon you. Plus you can just fly into twilight highlands, hyjal, and uldum. Since old world flight requires level 60 this isn't a problem. Maybe a warlock can help you with deepholme (set your hearth there, as there is a teleporter to your capitol city right in that room). Being higher level means that you get teleporters to those zones from your capitol city though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hoomin</div><div class="date">2010-12-10, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the guild exp and rep caps are both very bad. It would be like telling a player they can only earn so much exp per day and rep per week, why would they play the game? I mean we already had the world first 85 anyway it's not like having world first level 25 / exalted guild would be bad either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So from what Kalgan said, i guess then there's no point in playing this game now, you can easily come in like one year and do the same stuff with an ease... YAY!<br />
