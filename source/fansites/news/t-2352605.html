<br />
Please keep in mind that many, not all, but many of the EU top raiders get paid to stay home and farm AP all day either through sponsors or through their government since many EU governments pay students while they are in university. That is why players like Roger Brown have so many degrees, because if they stay in school they can keep collecting those checks. <br />
<br />
Also, congrats Method for proving that this raid tier will last forever after being cleared in 8 days.</div></div><hr />

People forget that guilds like Method basically make it their second job to rush for World Firsts and clear content as fast as they can. These guys have managers and everything. Not to mention Tomb of Sargeras was in some aspects overtuned. <br />
<br />
Most of the people going through this probably won't get to Mythic Argus before the month is over and that's being generous - let alone defeat him. If these guys want to do Mythic Antorus over and over until their mains and every alt and their mother's alt's alt are decked out in full Mythic gear, that's on them.</div></div><hr />

Never understood how it is considered a U.K. victory. It is a Method victory, the vast majority of the U.K. are just as stupid and up their own ass as the rest of the world. Unless you were in that team when they downed it, it is pathetic. Same thing if a U.S. guild did it, they did it, not the entire country.</div></div><hr />

World first aggramar was seven days ago. That's a whole week on a single boss from the best players in the entire world... and you call that &quot;ridiculously undertuned&quot;?<br />

It's boring from a viewers point of view. Imagine you bought a ticket for the heavy weight boxing world championship in, say New York, plus travel costs from anywhere in the world, and you are reaaaaaly looking forward to watching that fight live. And then... Wladimir Klitschko knocks his opponent out within the first 5 minutes of the fight. Exciting. Right?<br />
<br />
It's about entertainment. Not about how good I am at it, or anyone else for that matter. Maybe they should have released the raid after new years instead of so close before christmas. I understand that even raiders want to spend christmas time with their families and not glued to a screen. Bad timing, Blizzard, bad timing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do you think this is the first five minutes? Like I said, there's literally a week between Aggramar and Argus. Spending a solid week grinding a single boss in a video game is an insane amount of time, especially when we're talking about the very best players in the world.</div></div><hr />

He has a point, the U.S. isn't pampered and paid to play video games. We also have subpar internet models, I mean they sound like excuses, but then you live here and realize how good you have it. It is probably the reason it is still justified to give the U.S. the raid earlier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, the only way Blizz could stop these guilds is by making a boss mathematically impossible to beat. That's actually why during Vanilla/Wrath/TBC bosses took so long to kill, it was literally impossible until they were retuned. I think still less than a thousand guilds have even killed mythic KJ, so I'd say it's hilariously that most people call end mythic bosses pushovers.</div></div><hr />

It's about entertainment. Not about how good I am at it, or anyone else for that matter. Maybe they should have released the raid after new years instead of so close before christmas.

They killed Aggramar, and then killed Argus.<br />
<br />
Think of you being in a raid, you kill a boss, then do trash etc and kill the next one. Wowprogress tracks the time from the last boss kill, to the next one, for speedrunning purposes.<br />
<br />
So they killed Aggramar, and presumably had 2 hours of attempts before they killed him, if that makes sense. Not that the attempt took 2 hours.</div></div><hr />

I think the reason people like having a boss that isn't killed for weeks or even months is that it's exciting having content that hasn't been cleared- even if they're not competitive themselves. Having something mysterious and unbeaten unintentionally makes the game more exciting. It helps keep the raiding community alive.</div></div><hr />

Can't relate to that. I can't consider a boss &quot;beaten&quot; until I myself have beaten it with my team in any case, which is what keeps my drive to raid alive...</div></div><hr />

While Method is the best of the best, I personally think it was a disappointment because of it being the end boss of the expansion it barely surviving 1 reset. KJ survived 2, maybe 3 (not sure) resets before it was killed. It just seems to me that the final boss shouldn't be easier than a boss from the previous tier.</div></div><hr />

Sad thing is, I bet half the people complaining that the raid is too easy have probably not even beaten it on normal, let alone entered heroic or mythic :T Freaking slow down and enjoy the content and stop worrying about players who are so much better than you that you will never be at their level anyway.</div></div><hr />

Even though we could easily answer you saying that all bosses are now balanced around the fact that Addons exist, I'm pretty sure that Argus would be killable without DBM as all of the mechanics are pretty visual. And this type of players, after a few hundred wipes, know the timers perfectly enough.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to them, not that I really care, but I'm sure this Mythic Phase was balanced around 15-Pantheon trinkets, so that's impressive they could defeat him so quickly.<br />
<br />
Edit : Honestly this mount doesn't really make sense for Argus the unmaker. For any demonic boss prior to Argus, sure why not. But I would've seen a lightforged stuff or a titan-like stuff more fitting for defeating 2 titans in a row.</div></div><hr />

No, it's not. There is no encounter that lasts for 2 hours in one go. You'll probably assume &quot;well thats why they kill it, they had time&quot; but do you honestly think that when it comes to more casual guilds that raid mythic, it will work like that?

Final raid of Legion and it gets cleared past first weekly reset... :/<br />
<br />
Keep in mind these guys raid upwards of 12 hours/day and do 4-5 split runs on heroic in the first week. I used to lead a decent mythic guild that raided 3 days/week. If the players in Method raided on my raid schedule, they would've taken 2½-3 months to clear the raid, and that's not even accounting for thefact that they already have more than a full month's worth of gear before Mythic difficulty even opens.<br />
<br />
I don't really think it's a problem that you can clear the raid in a week if you raid as much as Method does.</div></div><hr />

The only way to keep a boss alive for longer than a week would be to overtune it to a point where it's not killable, which was the case for KJ. I guess another way could be to make previous bosses harder so they all don't die during the first day, but that doesn't make the last one harder because it took longer to get to it.</div></div><hr />

They would have pretty much like 2 tries for the night and that's it.<br />
<br />
So why does it say that it was a 125 minute fight, then?</div></div><hr />

Most of the time it's bugged. If you watch the other progress strreams you can see guilds hitting a hard enrage.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, right? So easy, btw how was the last mythic phase. Just asking since you were in the wf team.</div></div><hr />

You had nothing to do with them clearing the raid the only thing you have in common is that you're playing the same game. As for the mythic raid itself, as time goes more and more people will finish steps of it. It's a mechanic/gear check for most &quot;casual&quot; players, meaning they'll beat it eventually *if* they want to. You have to realize that most people might not have hundreds of hours every week to throw into raiding - or let alone a game.</div></div><hr />

Booo! to the devs for making the most boooooring WF race probs in WoW history, not to mention as an end of xpac race. You really don't know middle ground, do you?<br />
It's either ridiculously overtuned or undertuned. Not fun at all.<br />
<br />
Really hard to tune an instance when you are coming in with the same item level mythic drops #titanforge.<br />

<br />
That &quot;Fastest Kill&quot; metric on WoWProgress isnt the kill time, its the time taken to kill the boss from the previous boss killed, in this case Aggramar. So basically it took them 2 hours to kill Argus after they killed Aggramar in the reset.</div></div><hr />

Some of these encounters are so freaking amazing, especially Argus! The raid is great!<br />
<br />
If the quality of a raid is determined by how quickly the world's best raiding guild can plow through it... I think you are misunderstanding the purpose of the raids. Go have fun with them, enjoy the well designed bosses, the story, ect.<br />
<br />
Sad thing is, I bet half the people complaining that the raid is too easy have probably not even beaten it on normal, let alone entered heroic or mythic :T Freaking slow down and enjoy the content and stop worrying about players who are so much better than you that you will never be at their level anyway.<br />
<br />
This raid is the most enjoyable raid so far in Legion. I've got 3 bosses down on mythic, while my guild got 5(not in the optimal roster at certain bosses). The raid is genuinely fun. <br />
<br />
After playing through M Helya, M NH and M ToS(got 8/9, falling short on KJ), this raid is a refreshment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure that's exactly what people are talking about when they say it's easy. Back then top guilds played pretty much the same way they do now. Those few years ago the pressure on getting World First was much bigger than it is now simply because game was more popular. Now every few posts here we have mentions of &quot;no one giving a damn&quot; anymore. <br />
<br />
And people defending current difficulty level - stop joking, please. Most of my friends that quit in late WotLK or early/mid Cata didn't quit because they didn't had time to play anymore. They quit because PVE race was killed by difficulty levels. &quot;Allow everyone to kill end boss&quot; is the worst thing that ever happened in this game. Like it or not MMOs are about elitism. This is what makes the game interesting and pushes people forward. To get those shiny purples, same as this guy showing off near the bank in IF. Take that away and you kill the game because no one feels special for achieving something difficult or requiring shitton of time (Frostsaber in vanilla anyone?). Everyone is the same - boring. <br />
And if you have raids that elite clears in 2 weeks and after 4 months another 1500 guilds do the same (last expansion) than EVERYONE has allt he best items. There is no strive to get better stuff, no need to play more, no need to be better because you already got handed the best items. <br />
Yes, current epix are basically handed over to people comparing to Vanilla/TBC and even WotLK. People miss that feel of either being elite or aspiring to elite and eventualy getting there.</div></div><hr />

Arbitrary gating makes things so fun. Have alts, well they need this long attunement to be able to get into this raid is the only reason BT lasted so long. Good job choosing one raid from two expansions. Good Cherry pick. The only reason gear was less prominent back then is because you divided 2 pieces across 40 or 25 people. Takes a little longer to gear that way. <br />
<br />
Your anecdote about your friends leaving is exactly that. They left because multiple difficulties. Lol. If ilvl and gear isn't enough and various cosmetics and mounts aren't enough to make your epeen feel big then I don't know what to tell you. If you are playing for the sole purpose of feeling better than someone then date your achievements or look at your ilvl. <br />
<br />
I like that the front page basically says that you vanilla and TBC fanatics are wrong. The game is objectively harder and the players are objectively better. Argus the unmaker would have taken months to kill from his first pull with the skill level of Vanilla and BC and counting the shit gearing system, attunement system, etc that were all time bars to entry and nothing more, which kept people from being able to class stack etc as easily without poaching players. Man I miss gearing people who got poached because of spec/class to go to the next level. That was so fun right?</div></div><hr />

Final raid in TBC wasn't BT. It was Sunwell. And it was 2 months from 1st boss kill to KJ first kill. Damn, Mu'ru alone took more time than whole raid instance in Legion. <br />
Basicaly every raid back in the day took more time than current raids. <br />
<br />
And I hope you appreciate the irony of saying that I'm making arbitrary statements and at the same time arbitrally saying that &quot;objectively game is harded now and players are more skilled&quot;. Were players in Cata better than in WotLK? Yes, no? Because clearing raids took far less time in Cata than it did it WotLK. Last raid is 1,5 months vs 2 weeks. It makes me laugh when people somehow assume that in Vanilla, TBC or even WotLK everyone was goddamn noob and knew nothing about the game. Yes, people who raided for 3-4 years were noobs. Basicaly waht people like you are saying that from WoW launch to like mid/late WotLK players learned almost nothing. And in Cata they got magicaly 3 times as good as they were before. Funny statement tbh.</div></div><hr />
