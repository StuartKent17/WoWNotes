In all my time in WoW, I grinded rep willingly only in MoP.<br />
<br />
Every other rep grind was boring as fuck. And that INCLUDES the three Tanaan Jungle reps. It was so bad that after a couple of days, I spent 120k gold to buy rep tokens to get the achievement.<br />
<br />
I hate rep grinds.<br />

If you like grinds, then pull a DoubleAgent and level SOLELY by mining and herbalism.</div></div><hr />

This isn't called MMOCHAMPION the datamining spoiler alert page.<br />
<br />
Story spoiler alerts are usually very well hidden with an available link.<br />
<br />
They are not supposed to be readily visible without any action on the front page with a clear indication of whats happening.<br />
<br />
There are tons of people, myself included, not in this alpha/beta. I'm interested in gameplay changes, and they provide very well.<br />
<br />

Everyone hated the rep grind in TJ for the 3 rep. It sucked then and will suck in the future. It was a prob the biggest complaints in WoD for flight was the Lame no good for nothing rep grind. The other parts was ok. Even tho it should of been just like since BC, wotlk,cata, mop, hit max lvl buy the skill way it should of all ways been. <br />
<br />
But then you get these fools like Ion Hazzikostas and Brian Holinka, who are like im in charge now we do it my way and piss everyone off and then wonder why they are down to under 4 million players subbed and going forth will not say how many they got because the leaders are fools and made the game worse and even when told in alpha and Beta WoD that Ashran was a pile of Crap would not listen to the people and people telling them not having flying was a mistake and it cost them on that too. <br />
<br />
And hate to say it Lore, who I use to watch on Gamebreaker tv and his pod cast has done a 180 and drank the kool-aid and thinks blizz does no wrong now.</div></div><hr />

Watcher:<br />
Finally, I've seen some concern about rep &quot;grinding&quot; associated with this achievement. All of the referenced reputations are earned by doing level-up quests and world quests associated with those factions throughout the Broken Isles. There are no mob-grinding components to any of these reputations. Frankly, the Legion Pathfinder achievement was much easier to design than Draenor Pathfinder was, simply because we have much more outdoor world content in Legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or it's possible that he is infected by some new form of scourge or under enemy control (somehow) or like Garrosh was corrupted with Sha powers, so Horde leaders decided that it'll be safer to burn the body.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, nothing toxic about &quot;you will play the game the way I want, and anyone who plays it a different way is doing it wrong&quot; and &quot;I don't have the self-control of a kindergartener, so I'll demand that Blizzard blocks me from doing stuff I don't want to do, and to block everyone else from doing it, too.&quot;<br />

This isn't called MMOCHAMPION the datamining spoiler alert page.<br />
<br />
Story spoiler alerts are usually very well hidden with an available link.<br />
<br />
They are not supposed to be readily visible without any action on the front page with a clear indication of whats happening.<br />
<br />
There are tons of people, myself included, not in this alpha/beta. I'm interested in gameplay changes, and they provide very well.<br />
<br />
The story, I do not want to be spoiled. Thanks very much.<br />

A friend of mine doesn't want anything in Legion spoiled so she's purposely avoiding this site. Before today I would have assumed that is just common sense. But now I'm thinking she must be some kind of genius.</div></div><hr />

lol that was not what said blizz, they say that we could fly if we got the achi, and now they are giving that by chapters..... hope people wont continue leaving the game....<br />
<br />
Why blizz always do what a little group of people like.... damn.... if some people don't like flying then don't get the achi, and let the other people that like fly live in peace.<br />
<br />
i really hate this thing, blizz continue doing things wrong, because only asked a few what they want and not the entire community, and eventually those few, are the ones who end content quickly and leave the game .....<br />

<br />
It is Blizzard's game so they get to decide how we play, and they don't want everyone flying over all the new content from day one and trivializing it instead of exploring it on foot and doing the quests the way they were designed to be. Getting the achievements to fly in WOD was ridiculously easy, and it will be even easier in Legion. If you still don't like it then you don't have to play.</div></div><hr />

Imagine.. not being able to unlock running until level 40 -- you have to walk, slowly, everywhere until then.<br />
Would you complain having to walk from SW to SM?<br />
<br />
Truth is flight paths are boring (people alt+tab out, only a minority &quot;enjoy&quot; looking around). Since they haven't been creatively capable of coming up with any other form of transportation for people to use the alternatives are: Flying/no-flying. This, despite several other games not having flying and transportation not being an issue.<br />
<br />
But decisions like this is what made them go from 12-13 million to 4-5 million players ultimately.<br />
<br />
Personally, just to teach people like you a lesson I wish they'd remove mounts and the ability to run for a year as well as LFR, LFG, etc -- no insta-gratification of anything. Just walking. Everywhere. You want that dungeon? Grab a group in trade and spend 45 minutes to an hour walking there. Let's see if you stay then.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't bother with these type of scrubs.<br />
All this time they piss and moan about how flying took away 'immersion' yet log in and use them at all times.<br />
Ive always found it weird that Blizzard didnt leave flying in the game and just say ;<br />
'Hey fucktard social missfits if you dont like flying don't click the button' ...i mean wouldn't that be the most viable thing to do that way everybody has the option to do what they want.<br />
<br />
These toxic players remind me of these musl.... i mean people that walk in the room full of others, get offended and expect everyone to stop what there doing and leave. No if you don't like it then just turn around and fuck off, mind your own business.</div></div><hr />

Are you a caveman? I'm pro flying, check my comment where I say piss off to grinding rep. There was nothing wrong with the old way of paying gold at max level. That said I unlike you paid attention when they said flying would be like WoD, where you have to grind out shit and get it later. They never said you get the achievement at the start they said it would come in parts. It's going to be like WoD where you get it at the end when you no longer need it. If this bothers you then don't buy Legion. It bothers me, but not enough to avoid playing.</div></div><hr />

Another way of looking at it.<br />
<br />
You're at a party, having fun. Then someone insists that they start a mosh pit, even though others just want to have fun on their own.<br />
<br />
You ask them to stop bashing into everyone, because their obnoxious behavior is ruining it for others.<br />
<br />
If only they could go to a party where people WANT to do a mosh pit, it'd be so much better. But nope. These imbeciles want to engage in &quot;bumper cars&quot; with others, whether everyone else wants to or not.<br />
<br />
So yeah. The reaction of people who insists on enforced participation ALSO says a lot about gamers.</div></div><hr />

In regards to flying, I liked the pathfinder achievement in WoD. However I didn't see the purpose of having to have a certain reputation with a particular faction just to fly. I can understand everything else, explore the continent, do all of the quests, find some treasure so it doesn't become super trivial with flying, beat back some baddies in a certain area, then you've earned flying. But I don't see why I needed to get revered with walking bi-pedaled panthers in order to fly.</div></div><hr />
