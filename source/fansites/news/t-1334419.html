<br />
A presence more sinister than any demon hangs over Sanctuary….<br />
<br />
It watched from the shadows as a hero of nephalem lineage struck down Diablo, the Prime Evil, and trapped the demon lord within the Black Soulstone.<br />
<br />
It waited in silence as the mortal armies of Sanctuary crushed the leaderless remnants of the Burning Hells and scattered them into the stinging winds of Kehjistan.<br />
<br />
Now, as hope springs anew, its long vigil has ended.<br />
<br />
Shrouded in mystery and imbued with a power as ancient as the universe itself, it comes to the war-torn world of Sanctuary. It cannot be stopped. There is no escape.<br />
<br />
In its wake, only death will remain.<br />
<br />
The next chapter in Sanctuary's epic saga has been unveiled. Prepare to take on Death itself in Diablo III's upcoming expansion set: Reaper of Souls (http://www.diablo3.com/ReaperOfSouls).<br />
<br />
In Reaper of Souls, players will explore haunting new environments and face down fearsome new enemies within and beyond the world of Sanctuary as they seek to unlock the mysteries of Malthael, the Angel of Death.<br />
<br />
Stalwart adventurers can choose to continue their journey as one of five existing heroes—the Barbarian, Demon Hunter, Monk, Witch Doctor, or Wizard—or adopt the mantle of a new class: the Crusader, a fierce melee warrior whose command of the battlefield is matched only by his unwavering conviction.<br />

<br />
Advance through additional levels of supremacy, mastering bold new powers of raw, demon-slaying potential along the way. Customize your strengths with an improved Paragon system. Battle your way through newly randomized 3D maps and epic new quests in Act V. And test your mettle in all-new game modes—including Loot Runs and Nephalem Trials—designed to provide players with a highly replayable (and highly rewarding) end-game experience.<br />

At the bottom of the expansion site, it says &quot;Coming 2014&quot;. So anytime in the next 3 - 4 years....</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Blizzard, admit it: you can't make great games anymore... but hell you make amazing movies!&quot;<br />
<br />
Also: called it on the Crusader! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1333250-What-class-would-you-like-to-have-in-D3-expansion?p=22118248&amp;viewfull=1#post22118248)<br />
<br />
I do expect this game to address some of the flaws that keep me from enjoying D3 at the moment; I also expect it to make other, new mistakes, though. I think Blizzard themselves have realized by now that there were some pretty glaring errors in their design and policies, and I'm sure they'll at least try to do right. How it will turn out... well, we won't know that until it's done, now will we.</div></div><hr />

You farm more to get better gear to farm more. Repeat indefinitely. While this was ok in 1990s it doesn't fly in 2013. <br />
<br />
You can't have your entire game based around endless farming to get better gear to do more farming. It doesn't take long to hit a wall where it's either thousands of hours for a one slight upgrade or keep your sanity and quit.<br />
<br />
Blizzard we need other things to do! Lottery, pvp, artifact collecting and a million other ideas are ignored by blizzard to change around the gear. Putting a band aid on full artery cut is essentially what they are doing. Sure the xpac can give us 100-1000 more hours but it will be the same stale feeling when the uniqueness has worn off.</div></div><hr />

Considering the bluepost says &quot;Act V&quot; (probably implying that there will only be one, albeit longer than the average) still shows that it will be a bit &quot;shorter&quot; expansion, which makes 2014 perfectly probable imo</div></div><hr />

sorry but diablo 1 was by no means amazing. it was good at the time yeah, but i remember having a bunch of problems with that game. same goes for diablo 2. pre LoD, that game was a total joke. and dont get me wrong. i enjoyed the HELL lout of D2 and played it a bunch with my friends but im not gonna sit here and pretend that it was any better than D3. ive played a ton of D3 and enjoy it as much as i did D2.<br />

I knew that we where going to get a paladin type class, crusader looks pretty awesome. Finally we can get a class that isn't a glass cannon, or at least I hope its going to be a class with very high defense. One thing that bugs me is the new level cap, didn't they say over and over again that they wouldn't increase the level cap? Or is it a new level cap for paragon levels only?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're in the minority. Millions of people aren't going to rush out and buy this on day one like they did with D3. Blizzard has lost trust with their consumers. I know I felt ripped off and wanted my money back after buying it. Most will wait for reviews, and if the key problems with D3 aren't addressed they will pass. Maybe they should concentrate on giving us what they promised on the friggen box before thinking about an expansion.</div></div><hr />

Can't say i'm surprised, but I feel bad for the people that spend tens of thousands of dollars on items that will now be worth nothing.

<br />
Paragon is being reworked be an accountwide character buffing system. With no level cap. No guarantee on this but chances look good that when the Paragon revamp hits, Blizz is going to take the cumulative amount of paragon levels acquired on your characters and apply the sum value to your account.<br />
<br />
Loot Run feature is basically the popular demanded &quot;Endless Dungeon&quot;<br />
<br />
Mystic be brought into the game and will offer transmog and reforge services.<br />

<br />
Can't say i'm surprised, but I feel bad for the people that spend tens of thousands of dollars on items that will now be worth nothing. Part of me was thinking they'd just add another 50 Paragon levels or something, but the AH is a total mess and new level cap is really the only way to &quot;reset&quot; it because they aren't doing ladders.<br />
<br />
Kinda their problem for spending thousands of dollars on game eh?</div></div><hr />

You farm more to get better gear to farm more. Repeat indefinitely. While this was ok in 1990s it doesn't fly in 2013. <br />
<br />
You can't have your entire game based around endless farming to get better gear to do more farming. It doesn't take long to hit a wall where it's either thousands of hours for a one slight upgrade or keep your sanity and quit.<br />
<br />
Blizzard we need other things to do! Lottery, pvp, artifact collecting and a million other ideas are ignored by blizzard to change around the gear. Putting a band aid on full artery cut is essentially what they are doing. Sure the xpac can give us 100-1000 more hours but it will be the same stale feeling when the uniqueness has worn off.<br />
<br />
Regardless of what flaws Diablo 3 has, the whole point of Diablo games are the loot hunting and customizing your character. There are games that do the stuff you are describing pretty well already and Diablo is obviously not the game for you if you don't think loot hunting doesn't fly today.</div></div><hr />

Yes, D3 is sort of a survivor of another age. On the other hand, things like torchlight and POE show that the genre is still quite popular. But I agree, it is not for everybody to play (by play I mean something else than play through it once and shelf it).</div></div><hr />

Millions of people aren't going to rush out and buy this on day one like they did with D3. Blizzard has lost trust with their consumers. I know I felt ripped off and wanted my money back after buying it. Most will wait for reviews, and if the key problems with D3 aren't addressed they will pass. Maybe they should concentrate on giving us what they promised on the friggen box before thinking about an expansion.<br />
<br />
I will just say that we will have to see how many are going to buy the expansion on day one or the first week. Many did get disappointed with Diablo 3, sure, but so far the expansion announcement has been very well received (looked all across the web and got fairly surprised at the first reactions people shared, which was far from negative). <br />
<br />
If the expansion delivers on its promises as well as solving the core issues with the live version (which it looks like it will), then it actually may be quite successful.</div></div><hr />

Yes unfortunately with D3 there is no &quot;customizing your character&quot;. The only thing that changes with D3 over time is hitting for bigger numbers. Same content, no customization, no character progress. Still waiting on the whole 2v2 3v3 arena that was supposed to be in game and was a major selling point for many people, that was never implemented.<br />
<br />
The expansion is going to come out in 2014 most likely but seriously the content and features in D3 are extremely underwhelming. Definitely not 2014 quality stuff.</div></div><hr />

Crusader? Uh...uh....uhhhhhh....we already have a holy power warrior, called the Monk, now we have another called Crusader? What's next? Another wizard class?..Couldn't they thought of something else?..how about a dr00d-ish class for example?<br />
<br />
Finally a new expansion, but...I better not have to start over, I'll want to continue with my Monk as it is now with its items n gears into the next expansion.<br />

Might as well play CoD and whine about guns.<br />
<br />
PS. Since this seems to be such an alien concept:<br />
How many of those players who got Lord of Destruction got stuck for hundreds of hours? How many of them remained for years of Baal-farms.<br />
The true LoD fanatics thought D3 would be everything they loved 10 years ago and more. No wonder Blizzard actually had to keep the hype from creating a black hole.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't know if I'll play RoS. I defeated Diablo on Inferno and felt like I had gotten enough out of the game. Nothing wrong.<br />
Also, who'd like to bet on whether or not there are threads from people with too fat wallets right now on D3 forums, yelling for level cap to stay at 60? :D</div></div><hr />

Well, I agree that those are the main issues currently, but I mentioned it because that is the design intent of the Diablo games. Diablo 3 has been lackluster in those departments, but those are the things the game is designed to satisfy still. It's just a matter of if the game succeeds at it or not, which many agree it did not quite do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So now they've admitted that they're reasons for bashing stats points was a strawman argument, as I had argued. Jay Wilson talked about how much stats sucked in D2, and why they won't be in D3. But that's only because stats were done badly in D2, and there's no reason why a good stat system can't be added to D3. Finally they admit their bad mistake.</div></div><hr />

Well, neither you or I for that matter know the rest of the world, so 10 people here and there will not really give a good estimate on how well the expansion will be received.

He has a nice attitude and is refreshing listening to, which is something that was desperately needed after the whole Jay Wilson drama that occurred. Pretty happy that I don't have to read more drama caused by the community or the developers for that matter, anymore. By far the worst aspect of Diablo 3 than the flaws the game had itself.<br />

D3 is the biggest fail in the gaming industry.<br />

Please go open your own game company and amaze us with a game that will sell at least 1M copies.</div></div><hr />

Stat system, itemization (seems... vaguely addressed), skill system, complete map randomization, removal of AH (or optional ladder without it).<br />
<br />
Plus, with the expansion, will there be a ladder reset?<br />
<br />
They were planning on doing ladder resets, but I don't know if they were going to add them before or when the expansion comes. I believe I read somewhere that they may try add it beforehand, just like loot 2.0.</div></div><hr />

I just hope that you won't have to do the expansion content 3 times to unlock Inferno. Kinda like from Vanilla D2 to LOD. That is thing that bugged me the most about the D2 expansion.</div></div><hr />

I am disappointed, I was expecting something like a ladder system with no RMAH/AH - just trading, and a proper PvP system, although even all that wouldn't cut it am afraid, the skill system is kinda flawed, zero incentive to keep me playing. Instead of making a billion versions for consoles, they should be focusing on 'fixing' the PC version ASAP.<br />

As for the class, I was never a fan of the paladin, kinda wish they gave us druid/necromancer instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't understand why most people are so negative regarding D3. It blows my mind... It's a Hack'n'Slash RPG nothing more, nothing less, it's supposed to BE this way that's what Diablo was all about from the start. D3 is BETTER in every possible way than its predecessors.<br />
Same shit happens with people that want Vanilla WoW back, it seems they want to farm 1 month for 1000g for a shit ground mount. MoP is BETTER in every aspect than previous expansions.<br />
Me, I appreciate Blizzards work and hats off to every work they do. I wouldn't wish to be in their shoes and be sworn at every day for the most minuscule SHIT people complain about. People must learn a thing: Deal with it! Don't like it? Don't play it! Don't pay for it. PERIOD. Get out, get some air.<br />

Given its sold 12 million copies I somehow doubt any of what your saying lol<br />

D3 has been far more popular and is a better game than D1 or D2 was going only of units sold. My personal opinion is it is far better as well and I have played all 3 games.<br />

D3 certainly is not perfect, but i enjoyed it, and i still enjoy it every now and then. I´m looking forward to this addon, and despite what you &quot;and all of your friends say&quot; the xpac will sell millions as well, and won´t &quot;fail&quot; by any objective measure.</div></div><hr />

I guarantee a lot of people who bought into the hype of D3 and were sorely disappointed will not bother buying the xpac, so I'm pretty sure they won't get nearly the volume of sales on RoS. I for one was quickly turned off on D3; made it to Act 3 Inferno and said &quot;screw this&quot;. If they were to make boss drops be based on your character like they have in WoW's MoP quest rewards, where you know you're going to get something good for your character and not some crappy item that is barely worth breaking into components, then I may be slightly tempted. But the pure RNG and AH dependency of D3 was a major bomb.<br />
<br />
As for the cinematic, Blizzard does at least that much right; make good cinematics. After all, we do pay them hundreds of millions of dollars a year.<br />
(With the exception of the MoP cinematic, what a shiny pile of bullshit that was). <br />
<br />
A good cinematic does not a good game make. Words to think on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Respectfully, Diablo II didn't really get to be awesome until an expansion was available for it. The original D2 without expansions was OK but LOD is what made it great. No one knows if that will happen here but it seems the right thing to do is to wait and see.<br />
<br />
As for the reasons for its popularity there have been many millions of copies sold long after the word was out about its problems. And likely many more millions coming up with the console versions. As much as people seem to want to believe that the game is some terrible thing it's pretty clear that many people disagree.</div></div><hr />

Haters have their reasons. D3 has been a huge let down for many, I know it's a pretty good game now and I still play it from time to time... But it's not what I was expecting in terms of &quot;fun&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Not the same segment. PoE is way more targeted into a minority of hardcore players than is D3. If you want to play PoE (with weekly ladders, mind you), more power to you.</div></div><hr />

You forgot the part where someone gets redeemed. To be honest, Diablo's story was never its strong point, nor should it be, as for D3's story - I had some good laughs with the villains, how they appeared in every corner - telling you what they are going to do next etc. they should just keep it simple, IMO.</div></div><hr />

Yeah the millions of people that stormed the forums and gaming sites in outrage over how horrible the game was, that was all a dream. An entire country demanding refunds never happened. Gaming sites laughing and making jokes about errors were all made up.

<br />
That said however, this expac looks pretty cool. They seem really determined to fix most of the glaring problems this disappointment of a game has. Removal of the Auction House and perhaps some changes to the skill system (which is pretty uninteresting as it is now) would seal the deal for me.<br />

<br />
That's because Internet wasn't as widespread in 2000 as it is in 2012. There was very few forums to actually storm, and no refunds to claim because in most countries, you couldn't even get a refund on a CD as it was considered a reproductible medium.<br />
<br />
Of course, not every person who buys the game loves the game, that would be too simple. But the Internet forums as a way to QQ (with all the toolkit of retarded expressions, memes and so on) didn't really emerge until well after D2.</div></div><hr />

Yes D3 has its faults but not compared to the likes of SWTOR &amp; Dragon Age 2. <br />

I am done giving Blizzard the benefit of the doubt after the fail that was D3. I'm sorry, but Blizzard used to be the masters of the special sauce when it came to their games, and I was that guy who always stood in line to pick up a CE version of their games. When I fired up D3, it was a decent enough game but I could not stomach playing it through repeatedly on the higher difficulties; there was no randomness, the loot sucked and crafting was pointless. I put the game down for Torchlight II which I felt was infinitely better (random maps after beating the game, more interesting loot ... *secret areas*, etc etc).<br />
<br />
So yeah, D3 sold plenty of copies I'm sure because there were a lot of suckers like me who rushed out and blindly bought the game. I am done; Blizzard has to earn my trust this time around.</div></div><hr />

I know, right? Believing that a small company with a handful of resources will come up with a great game is silly. Well, not exactly that. If they do, bigger companies will integrate those ideas in their own games and will improve on them (because, well, they already know what went wrong or right).<br />
<br />
Let's take an almost completely non-Blizzard example: Dota. It started as a WC/SC mod. What happened next? Well, big guys (Valve for Dota 2 and Riot for LoL) took over the concept and made something bigger (I'll refrain from commenting on &quot;better&quot; because I don't play those games). And now, maybe Blizzard will finally make All-Stars. So yeah, the initial concept was done by a small group, but it all ends up in the hands of big players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To each his own. I have to ask though, why was it that Torchlight II had:<br />
<br />
1. More loot<br />
2. More interesting loot<br />
3. Random dungeons<br />
4. Random overland maps each play-through<br />
5. Secret areas<br />
<br />
I could go on and on, but Torchlight II had a shockingly superior amount of content compared to a game that had probably 10 times the budget and staff working on it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and on top of that - Torchlight II had way less bugs! Do we even need to go into detail on all the embarrassing bugs that plagued D3? This from the company that almost invented the phrase &quot;.... when its ready &quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahh, the blind fanboi fanatacism. Look, you like the game, thats awesome just don't ignore reality because the haters are hating rather angrily on your fav game. Actually I don't remember how crappy D2 was initially because I'm pretty sure I was still playing it after a year and yes, LOD made the game even better. I quit playing D3 after 2 months or so, with two characters in the mid 30s.<br />
<br />
There is no comparison to D2 that is valid because of two words: Error 37. Aka pointless DRM that locks you into the AH and kept people from playing the game they bought for a few days. Apparently action rpg's are now mmos. Blizz knows about mmo release day problems and yet... Toss in Jay Wilson n' team's attitudes, horrid loot design/drop tables that also pushed you to the AH. The AH making it a gold farming game, thus gold farmers and exploiters. The only upside there for some was they got their real money back selling on the real money AH. <br />
<br />
It was obvious by level 15 on my first character that unless I wanted to play an ironman variant the best place to get actual loot I could use was the gold AH. I'd rag on the silly storyline and acting but that didn't matter as much as the other factors and hey, its a hack n' slash &quot;rpg&quot;. An rpg without stats. Its even dumbed down more than WoW is these days.<br />
<br />
TLDR version:<br />
Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Reviews will have to be awesome and the expac tops out at $30 or less for me to be interested.</div></div><hr />

D3 just felt... well, like how running in one of those wheels must feel to a hamster. Never ending and pointless. I play through the game, so I can... beat it on a harder level... ok, fine. After 3 or 4 times, it's just boring. <br />
<br />
I doubt I'll get RoS unless they do some kind of deal on it like they did with D3 and WoW where you'd get a free copy and a mount if you sub'd to WoW for a year.</div></div><hr />

I quit playing D3 after 2 months or so, with two characters in the mid 30s.<br />
Bolded part is the most important one. You don't remember. Well, it was bad. People played it because they had much less choice than today. Not to mention that whoever coded D2 ground sprites should have been smacked on the head a lot of times.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no comparison to D2 that is valid because of two words: Error 37. Aka pointless DRM that locks you into the AH<br />
There is absolutely no relationship between a DRM and AH. Battlefield has a DRM but no AH. What locks into the AH is the rarity of drops, not the DRM. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Apparently action rpg's are now mmos. Blizz knows about mmo release day problems and yet...<br />
Because it is cheaper to endure 24hours of problems than rent 10x more servers for the first 24 hours and not know what to do with them afterwards.<br />
Besides, the main problem were the authentication servers, not the game servers themselves.<br />
<br />
Any company dealing with a flow of customers dimensions their installations according to some average value, not peak value. Which is why you have stuff like waiting times at call centers, for instance. No company is rich enough (or more accurately, stupid enough) to dimension around a peak value that will happen literally once during the release.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The AH making it a gold farming game, thus gold farmers and exploiters. The only upside there for some was they got their real money back selling on the real money AH.<br />
Nah, there was absolutely no botters in D2. No pindle bots, no duped items, no ith items, no maphack. It is all invented by the D3 fanboys.<br />
<br />
Edit: oh, and no PKers and TPPK hacks. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It was obvious by level 15 on my first character that unless I wanted to play an ironman variant the best place to get actual loot I could use was the gold AH. I'd rag on the silly storyline and acting but that didn't matter as much as the other factors and hey, its a hack n' slash &quot;rpg&quot;. An rpg without stats. Its even dumbed down more than WoW is these days.<br />
<br />
Because dumping all the points into one stat was very fun (hi to all bowazon players out there *wave*).</div></div><hr />

<br />
But why are you comparing a game released in 2012 to a game released in 2000? <br />
<br />
Honestly, vanilla d2 wasn't as bad as d3 is because people didn't expect d2 to be that good after release of d1. D2 ,however, has set a certain benchmark of what diablo games should be like, and a game released 12 years later miserably failed to achieve that. <br />
As a standalone game, d3 would be okay, as a continuation of the diablo series it's a major step backwards.</div></div><hr />

Oh dear. No, what locks you into the AH first, is the DRM. You cannot as in the past play on &quot;open bnet&quot; aka cheater heaven or on your own servers/direct IP if you want to use character editors or avoid bnet connection issues. You have to be online to play at all in D3. What was worse was finding out that on top of the DRM (supposedly to defeat piracy) the gameplay itself (rarity of drops worth a damn) drives you into their AH and we have either a gold farming game or a real cash money farming game. Then blizz nerfs gold rates etc..<br />
<br />
<br />
Because it is cheaper to endure 24hours of problems than rent 10x more servers for the first 24 hours and not know what to do with them afterwards.<br />
Besides, the main problem were the authentication servers, not the game servers themselves.<br />
<br />
It cost them a lot of PR. Error 37 hit worldwide, you had non internet/gaming news folks talking about it. And yes, if you can't handle auth servers for 12 million and eat that cost, as big as blizzard is... I'm not gonna have a good attitude at overall customer/game support in the future. Just 24 hours... looks like you've forgotten all about blizzards long standing issues with battle.net from D1/2 and SC days. Yes, hackers/pirates used FSGS because they didn't pay but so did legit users to avoid bnet lag. And hell, you said &quot;rent&quot; servers. They can't fork over extra bucks to rent a server? They're not buying the hardware... sigh. <br />

Oh, so your idea of a good game mode is the open bnet where you can cheat? OK, then I suppose online games are not for you indeed, precisely for that reason. Because having an SP mode or an open net mode implies that you have server code (or parts of it) on your client, which makes hacks 10000x times easier to happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What was worse was finding out that on top of the DRM (supposedly to defeat piracy) the gameplay itself (rarity of drops worth a damn) drives you into their AH and we have either a gold farming game or a real cash money farming game.<br />
Yeah, because in D2, useful uniques dropped all over the place... oh wait no, they didn't. The difference is not the drop rate (what was the DR of Tyrael's might in D2?) but the fact that D2 was tuned for single-player mode with no party and trade, which made even HC gameplay a snoozefest (minus the dreaded Disconnect boss, of course). D3 is tuned towards an online community and intense trading. Which is IMO a much tighter way to tune a game. Besides, even D3 can be completed in self-found mode (some people I know did that pre-Inferno nerf, mind you).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

It cost them a lot of PR? Sure thing, no doubt about that. But that didn't cost them the server. You can argue that it's stupid, and I would tend to agree, but that's how companies work these days. In the same tune, a lot of companies would rather decline a raise demand from a good employee, watch him leave and then realize that it will be more expensive to hire a new one, plus you'll have to re-train him. But that's how all companies work: a cost saving that can be calculated &gt; a potential loss. Modern management 101, alas.<br />
<br />
<br />

They just did with Paragon points, which is imo much more fun than the original D2 system.</div></div><hr />

No offline mode because hacks. Not just about items. Same reason you couldn't play your online chars in offline mode in D2. They'd have to make it so you need to roll a whole new char for offline play, and you could never play them online. Which sucks. It sucked in D2 as well, they wanted to avoid that shitty situation this time and since almost everyone has a net connection now, it made sense.<br />

<br />
I mostly agree with your post, but D2 was completely intended to be played in a group from Hell at least (even NM can be a pain to solo for some classes). I remember people asking on the forums about how they were supposed to solo Hell as a Lightning Sorc when every 4th mob was Lightning Immune, and Blizzard said &quot;you aren't supposed to solo Hell&quot;*.<br />
<br />
*(I mean, personally I soloed Hell on most of my chars, but it involved a lot of pack skipping, immune breaking and assorted BS that clearly was not the intended way to play the game)</div></div><hr />

from screenshots of items I saw a lot of BoA stuff, so it may be possible that the AH will be much less of a problem with the expansion. Hopefully ^^</div></div><hr />

i wouldnt complain if the warcraft movie was like this. The wow intro movies are kinda awesome. So a full 2-3 hour movie would be kick ass. But i would think that would take a lifetime to make :p</div></div><hr />

I mean, yeah, it looks incredible and all but hello... the gameplay and changes are the ones that matter, not a 3 minute CGI that has nothing to do with the actual game (bear with me a little). After Diablo 3 and the disappointment it caused due to the damned RMAH dependent gameplay, people need to be cautious about what to expect... the changes they are promising are looking great... ON PAPER. We still know nothing about the system changes and how it will affect the game. I remain an optimist (one fail does not factor a pitch fork and a curse for all time in my book) but we will have to wait and see whether this will be worth it or not.<br />
<br />
PS: Crusader... really? I know Paladin is a huge deal in WoW but come the f--k on! We had em in D2, why is it a sin to call it that in D3... seriously.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tomana</div><div class="date">2013-08-22, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So people want soulbound items, wasd movement... why do people want Diablo to be WoW? I happen to like both... but I also like milkshakes and hot dogs, doesn't mean I want a hot dog milkshake.<br />
I don't know about WASD movement (I think it would be a hindrance more than anything else), however, regarding the soulbound items - Diablo 3 needs a way to get items (and gold) out of the economy. Soulbound (or rather account-bound, actually) items are one of the possibilities to do so. The other one would be ladder, but I am not a big fan of having ladder back again.<br />
<br />
<br />
No offline mode because hacks. Not just about items. Same reason you couldn't play your online chars in offline mode in D2. They'd have to make it so you need to roll a whole new char for offline play, and you could never play them online. Which sucks. It sucked in D2 as well, they wanted to avoid that shitty situation this time and since almost everyone has a net connection now, it made sense.<br />
Precisely. Offline mode = server code installed locally = trouble.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I mostly agree with your post, but D2 was completely intended to be played in a group from Hell at least (even NM can be a pain to solo for some classes). I remember people asking on the forums about how they were supposed to solo Hell as a Lightning Sorc when every 4th mob was Lightning Immune, and Blizzard said &quot;you aren't supposed to solo Hell&quot;*.<br />
<br />
*(I mean, personally I soloed Hell on most of my chars, but it involved a lot of pack skipping, immune breaking and assorted BS that clearly was not the intended way to play the game)<br />
<br />
Sure, but there are several important things:<br />
- D2 LOD didn't spring to life with 1.10 and synergies that produced extreme single-element builds. Prior to 1.10, the lack of synergies made dual-element specs much more widespread. Some specs (trapassins and FO/FB) were perfectly capable of dealing with most of the mobs. Not to mention cheese... I mean hammerdins.<br />
- Hell was soloed by a lot of people, including naked HC toons. The fact it is possible is making the game not tuned optimally.<br />
- Sure thing, Hell was designed with a group in mind. The trick is, it was designed with just that in mind. Once you had an OK group, you could just steamroll through it. We played an ironman HC group once (ironman means clearing every zone but only once and using only self-found items) and with classes selected to synergize perfectly, it was still quite easy to play.<br />

Ya good call. Point and click is the way of the future, said no one ever.<br />
<br />
You can also move with auto-move and rotating your mouse, which approximates WASD quite ok. Personally, that's what I do.<br />
Additionally, it can save you in those wth moments where clicking only gets you clicking on more mobs :p</div></div><hr />

i only care about if they delay 1.09 or even if 1.09 will exist or only when the expansion is released with patch 2.0 we will have the new loot<br />
<br />
Players want the new loot to start playing D3 again, don't be evil Blizzard and don't delay/cancel patch 1.09 on purpose</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you say people have wisened up? Not least the forums here surely have sharpened people's perceptions. Especially those of the people who were having such a great time with the game that they didn't know what a shitty time they had. Poor bots and Asian farmers that are left. They have nothing to sell their stuff too then.<br />
<br />
So - surely everyone else has now wisened up and the x-pac will not sell at all.<br />
<br />
I shall be interested to read the topics however when RoS is out. And remind people that the super awesome D2 (I loved it, no question) sold 4.5 million, apparently everyone is still stoked about how great that game was - and funnily LoD (which I loved too) proceeded to sell only 1.5 million copies (which is 33%...right?). Why? Why didn't LoD sell 4.5 million like D2 when D2 was already loved by everyone?<br />
<br />
I am sure however that if the same happens with RoS (that it sells 33% of D3 copies) people will see that as proof of failure.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the goddamn genre?<br />
<br />
Might as well play CoD and whine about guns.<br />
<br />
PS. Since this seems to be such an alien concept:<br />
How many of those players who got Lord of Destruction got stuck for hundreds of hours? How many of them remained for years of Baal-farms.<br />
The true LoD fanatics thought D3 would be everything they loved 10 years ago and more. No wonder Blizzard actually had to keep the hype from creating a black hole.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't know if I'll play RoS. I defeated Diablo on Inferno and felt like I had gotten enough out of the game. Nothing wrong.<br />
Also, who'd like to bet on whether or not there are threads from people with too fat wallets right now on D3 forums, yelling for level cap to stay at 60? :D<br />
the problem isnt that we had to farm bosses or areas for drops.. the problem was that we DID farm for ages and still got nothing. back in d2 lod u could do 100 hell mephy kills and you'd get boatloads of items.. probably that occulus or grim shield/ tal rasha chest or shako for your sorc to drop. unique elite items werent that &quot;unique&quot; in a sense cause any idiot could go out and farm them. but despite their lower drop rate.. they werent really that low. high runes and runewords became the elite gear and while many people didnt have them, they still were fun to try and hunt for.<br />
<br />
diablo 2 was more about item hunting, it was about pvping..about lvling, and about making alts .. and the secret cow lvl... you could skip act1s first quest and instead just kill andy if u wanted to.. u still had to gather all the pieces of the staff. but the good news is.. hey you can go straight to duriel after.. same with mephisto and diablo.. and baal really.. instead of being force fed a bunch of bullshit quests that we need to complete 3x..just to progress.. theres the option to skip shit.<br />
my problem was never about replayablity.. its about the lack of reward.. item drop rates were insanely low, all the good rares.. were really not that good.. and legendaries.. could be awesome or terrible depending on whether they came with 1 wrong affix.. or stats way too low. did you ever hear about that strength bow in diablo 2? of course not... the bow was predetermined to have dex on it.. because things were right back then. blizz screwed up with the AH and making customers rely on it in order for any trade to even be remotely viable.. and the game suffered because of that.<br />
<br />
as for the trailer.. ya it really doesnt do much for me at all. i might get the game just to explore it. but after being handed the pile of shit that d3 turned out to be. im not gonna get my hopes up into thinking the expansion will be any better. atleast they are trying to fix legendaries though.</div></div><hr />

That is so true. How anyone who played D3 could still sink money into an expansion is beyond me.<br />
<br />
When the developers themselves said the RMAH screwed up the game and continue to leave it is means they will quickly screw over you for cash.<br />
