Apparently we will have to wait a while before there is anything new about the World of Warcraft Movie. Deadline.com reports that Sam Raimi will direct the Wizard of Oz prequel for Disney. 
 
Assuming that Sam Raimi is still the director for the World of Warcraft movie as previously announced by Blizzard, it looks like it will have to wait a little longer.

Blue posts<br />
Reforging - Spirit will be a reforgeable stat<br />
We don't want players changing Agi, Str, Stam or Int (or armor!) on items for probably obvious reasons, but converting Spirit to something else or something else into Spirit shouldn't be a problem. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399601775/reforging-spirit-a-primary-or-secondary-stat/))<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Hard Modes<br />
They will probably be unlocked very quickly, maybe after one clear, or maybe right from the beginning. We're still working those logistics out. We held the LK ones back partially because we shipped that patch late in the year and didn't want to ask players to raid their asses off over the holiday season. (Yeah, I know, more nanny state discussion ensues.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Raid Gear Requirements<br />
I would also expect a little more gearing up from 85 quests / heroics / crafted materials before jumping right into the raids this time around. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
25-Player Raids not attractive anymore in Cataclysm?<br />
If we wanted to remove 25-player raids, we'd just do that. We know a lot of players like them. Personally, I will probably keep raiding 25s. A lot of players like the 10s too though, and despite what fans of the 25s might think, offering lower item level loot in the 10s doesn't make them attractive enough. We're going to try instead offering more rewards (which includes loot) in the 25s, especially for the heroic modes. Many (though not all) of the players worried about the reward per effort of 25 raiding are concerned more with the heroic modes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Running both 25 and 10-Player raids each week<br />
This isn't speculation on our part. We have the data. As far as motivation, in some cases the 10 gear ends up being better than the 25 gear. Especially on 10 heroic, which a group of raiders in 25 level gear can often handle, the 10 gear is equivalent. There is also the issue of badges, which you can only maximize if you hit both versions every week.<br />
<br />
We know there are a lot of players who want to run 10s who feel compelled to run 25s for the better loot. We know there are a lot of players who want to run 25s and feel like they still have to do 10s as well. We know both groups of players are getting frustrated and burning out -- not because they don't like raiding, but because they don't like raiding the same content twice a week, particularly when the 10 version tends to not even be challenging since their 25 participation ensures they overgear it.<br />
<br />
One raid lockout with same item levels for 10 and 25 and a weekly cap on badge income solves all of those problems for us. It does creates two potential new problems. One, players may gravitate towards 10s because the logistics are easier. We intend to handle that by making 25s more efficient at earning gear. Two, players who really like to run both a 10 and 25 every week lose that opportunity. Sorry. If it's any consolation, because the bosses are divided among multiple raid zones you can still do some in a 10 and some in a 25 or have an alt that only does a couple of those zones a week without the full commitment of two complete boss kill cycles every week. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Guild talents &quot;removal&quot;<br />
I think this is a common problem. Some players focused on &quot;cut guild talents&quot; without reading what we are doing instead.<br />
<br />
Imagine you are a priest. Some of your spells are talents, such as Penance and Circle of Healing. If you take Circle of Healing, you don't have enough points to get Penance. Talent trees are about (sometimes tough) decisions. However, many of your other spells you get by leveling, such as Prayer of Mending and Mass Dispel. You don't have to make a hard choice to get those, but you do have to put some work in.<br />
<br />
The guild bonuses used to be talents. They are now more like leveling spells. We call them perks now instead of talents. We haven't cut any content, but just changed the UI from boxes with prereqs to a list. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399601135/please-rethink-the-guild-tree-and-path-removl/))<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Features<br />
I try not to make ranked lists of features between expansions, because it always feels like you're comparing apples to oranges (&quot;Now with 14.2% more raid bosses!') and has a lot to do with how interested you are in any of those features (&quot;Fishing has a new icon!&quot;). I'll just say that Cataclysm is massive, feels really polished even at this early stage, and has a ton of content. It feels a lot like two expansions, because you have the 80-85 content as well as an all new 1-60 experience. We don't sing the praises of our quest design team enough. They have poured their souls into this expansion and you realize that from your very first quest. There are just so many &quot;holy crap!&quot; moments.

Jumping charge and intercepts<br />
We don't view avoiding a Charge in this way to be an acceptable use of skill. Note that I am talking very specifically about the OP's scenario, and not about whether warriors are punished more or less than other classes for internet latency.

World of Warcraft Fan Wallpaper<br />
The World of Warcraft Fan Wallpapers (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/wallpapers/fan-wallpapers/) section has been updated with the 3rd piece of the very impressive &quot;The Stars' Fury&quot; series of artworks from Jeremy Sun. He also has a pretty nice gallery on wow.duowan.com (http://wow.duowan.com/0902/m_97930466790.html)<br />
<br />
I'm sure one of the elite photoshopper of the forum will create a nice compilation of the 3 wallpapers, and one of our extreme geek will post a nice picture of the wallpapers on a 3 monitors setup. (Do it, please.) <br />

Remember before WOTLK how many ppl were like &quot;10 ppl will be too easy and no one will enjoy killing the same boss in 25 after&quot;?<br />
<br />
One other thing I really hated about WOTLK is the fact that Blizzard made the heroics so easy that I find only frustration being forced to do them for badges, and no challenge or happyness of success or any bit of adrenaline. Is just poor. I loved the model from TBC where I was able to do max 1 heroic (sometimes 2, but rarely) per day before the raid (after I came back from work). I don't want long heroics, I just want challenging ones so I don't get bored.</div></div><hr />

Believe it or not, and like it it or not, people actually ENJOY RAIDING. It's the entire reason some of us play.<br />
For me running a 10 man after a 25 isn't about gear at all, it's entirely about raiding.</div></div><hr />

You also should have a good guild. And then you should also raid for the progress, gear is good to, but its second, because clearing the shit is priority.<br />
<br />
If you have the same gear as puggers, you are not a &quot;good&quot; raider. Im sorry, but thats why we have heroics. The only heroic gear i see on puggers is the lootship gear. When i see a player filled with HC gear, hes probably a good, respected raider. <br />
<br />
If having the BiS gear matters to you, the raid changes should mean NADA, because puggers will never, ever have the BiS gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Same ID 10/25 men is a FAIL!!!<br />
<br />
I cannot see PUG people with my same raider gear.<br />

This raider is probably a pugger himself, seeing you whine over puggers with the same gear as you. Therefore, all your points means nothing.</div></div><hr />

I don't really care one way or another but the tune keeps changing every blue post that gets front paged. I mean I understand it's subject to change since teh game isn't released yet (and may be changed even after cata is released) but it's changing regularly before the game is even out yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
LoL, it does totally sound like it's never the same person posting the blue posts and that they never talk to each other or don't have the same information...lol<br />
<br />
Yesterday was...<br />
<br />
The amount of gear in the 25 person raids will be roughly equivalent on per-person basis to the 10 person raids.<br />
<br />
and today is...<br />
<br />
We're going to try instead offering more rewards (which includes loot) in the 25s<br />
<br />
They are as confused as we are hehe...Hopefully they get it done right in the end thought, that is what matters most.</div></div><hr />

I have to disagree with you here, random loot is random and it's simple facts that some people might be sporting 277 in almost every slot, while another raider from the same guild has 1-2 pieces of heroic gear.</div></div><hr />

So enjoy, anti-PUG-party, in LK the 10 version was always designed to be the easy/noob version that allows many pugs to raid, now it will be much harder which will result in lesser pugs and noobs with your gear.<br />
As long as blizzard doesn't go the other way and change the 25 version to the 10 level :&gt;<br />

All in all, good changes :)</div></div><hr />

Cant believe your gonna offer the same gear to people who do 10 mans as people who do 25's. Obviously 25 man is harder to coordinate etc therefor harder work is more deserving of better rewards. You say that encounters are going to be of similar difficulty but who cares its so much easier to get 10 people together than 25. Honestly I already hate seeing people with the same looking gear as me aka your crappy weapon models etc. The rewards of raiding and 25 mans are gone cause there is not much difference between hard mode and reg or 10 man and 25 just stupid stats. What is so epic or rewarding about having the sword from HLK when some noob can have the same looking weapon from 10 reg marrowgar? You took a dump on the feel of raiding by doing 10 and 25 versions of every instance. We don't want a hard mode to drop the same weapon as regular but with better stats go back to more of the Ulduar feel for hard mode loot. TBC badge system was awesome wasn't too hard core and wasn't too easy. Badge system now is a complete joke along with this entire expansion. Why did you have so many people start playing when wrath released? cause tbc was pretty dang a successful and with wrath well you crapped on your success. If your going to have the same crap drop from 10 and 25 why not just get rid of 25 or better yet why don't you just have the stuff drop from 5 mans. During tbc I did Kara 10 man cause it was an upgrade over 5 man heroics and then when I went to 25 man as my gear and skill progress it was truly epic and rewarding and now your ripping that rewarding feeling of doing 25 man away. Get rid of this idea of same loot crap for doing the same instance no matter what raid size you have get rid of a 10 and 25 version of every instance and bring back the kara type instance where you started and when you mastered kara you went on to the 25 man grulls or mag etc. ZA was cool cause it was a unique 10 man that both the casual and more hardcore players could enjoy and benefit from. Wanna know the truth ICC is epic fail and you don't even wanna know what I think about toc just shows that you have no respect for the wow community. Like for real who are half the bosses in ICC why does ICC seem so barren like the monstrosities that are there don't reside there. I honestly expected when I reached Lich King that sindragosa would swoop down and try to kill me, and ICC seems so retardedly boring cause its split up by stupid halls. I hear you all im gonna do 25 man blah blah blah sounds like your just trying to sugar coat a bunch of crap that we don't want. BTW I'm really looking forward to rated battlegrounds, I hate arena and truly believe its ruining the game with all the balancing etc. Please excuse any spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes.</div></div><hr />

Vanilla: TIers dropped by bosses. No badges A+++<br />

TBC and WOTLK(NAXX): Tiers dropped by bosses. Badges and some item buyable with badges A+(a little fail)<br />
<br />
WOTLK(TOC and ICC): Minimal Tier buyable with emblems B+++(another fail)<br />
<br />
Cataclysm: 10 and 25 man have same loot. All 'll have same equip item. This a kind of comunism policy. F+++ (BIG fail)<br />

Blizzard! Give us a server for pure wow-ers without that &quot;gifts&quot;(emblems,Buyable tiers,ect)<br />

And when Blizzard first announced 10 man raiding I hated it and I was one of those that (mini)nerd raged. But the ironi of it all is that I see 10 man as the salvation to many old school players as myself. <br />
<br />
Im pretty burnt out on 25 man raiding, had a long break last gear and just got back to play (11/12 ICC 25 HC) and I just dont feel the way I did a couple of years ago.<br />
With this new step that Blizzard has taken, making you choose 10 or 25 man and that you get the same loot, well, it just feels like a step in the right direction.<br />
I see myself going &quot;all out&quot; in 10 man content in the future and it feels soooo good not to be foreced to raid 4-5 times a week, the same instance 2x times a week just to get BiS items from both 10 and 25 man. This was what burnt me out when Ulduar came out, it just became to much for me personaly. <br />
<br />
I know alot of ppl dont have any problem playing every night but for me personaly i feel that my prime time in WoW is over and I just want to enjoy the game when I want to and not be forced to sit in raids 3+ times a week. With a smaller guild focusing on 10 mans and now actually getting the same benifits/loot (well not the same amount but still the same loot) you wont feel left out as you do now and this really makes me feel that I have atleast 1 more year to give to WoW.<br />
<br />
I also belive that 25 man will go away in the future. I think that 10 man is the way to go and tbh, its way more enjoyable to sit with 10 ppl you know well and not having to deal with the hassel in 25 man raid where u might not like alot of ppl/ppl cant play.<br />
<br />
Hopefully Cata will give me what i have been missing this last exp. And with the sceen set in the old world, it has every potential to succeed.</div></div><hr />

The fun thing about that movie is that I remember IMDB once said 2007 then 2010, then 2011 and now 2013. Blizzard dont think about their loyal gamers who care about the lore, are getting older and older. <br />

Anyway, some of the blue posts about the 25 loot situation seem to contradict earlier posts. So basically I'm going to remain on them fence about it for now, since I've rarely had any serious gripes with how it's been handled in the past (or seen anyone else with gripes worth mentiong that aren't being addressed, for that matter). Hopefully they will clarify it more.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I am excited about this. I play the game as an inexpensive social environment, but still like the challenge of the game. After I realized the futility of trying to compete with people who have an infinite amount of time, I canceled my account. That is lost revenue for blizzard (do not kid yourself, blizzard is a for-profit business). I see myself returning to the game as I can play it as I originally intended: as a social environment, and still not have aspects of the game locked away from me.</div></div><hr />

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. My opinion is that the Twilight series should never have been published and players should be a tiny bit more inventive when thinking of names for their characters. This applies to:<br />
- Every worgen that will be named a variation of Jacob<br />
- Every death knight named a variation of Arthas or Mograine<br />
- Every blood elf or night elf named a variation of Legolas</div></div><hr />

(Yeah, I know, more nanny state discussion ensues.)<br />
<br />
Maybe that was a justifiable reason for delaying the launch of the Plagueworks in Icecrown Citadel by a month, but in my opinion, the phased implementation system in raids was horribly flawed since Trial of the Crusader.<br />
<br />
With Sunwell Plateau, it was justifiable. Five hard bosses, and you wanted to give these guilds an equal oppurtunity to take on each boss.<br />
<br />
It actually ruined Trial of the Crusader though. Defeating an effortlessly easy boss and then being told you have to wait another week is a disappointment. It may prolong raid content but in my opinion, heres how I think it should work<br />
<br />
Release the entire raid on patch day, no gating whatsoever. It worked for Ulduar.<br />
Allow players to access Heroic modes on individual bosses upon release immediately<br />
Make Normal mode bosses somewhat manageable even for less experienced raiders<br />
Make Heroic modes abnormally hard. Like to the point where you need good co-ordination and gear to stand a chance<br />
<br />
<br />
e.g. Cho'gall on Normal could be medium difficulty with a few surprises in store, but on Heroic difficulty, he could be a raidwiping behemoth.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blonk</div><div class="date">2010-06-17, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My current guild has been active in end-game raiding since Vanilla with an outstandingly talented roster. Even as of now, after many of them lost interest with the simplification of WotLK raids, we're on LK25 HM. The discussion has come up about how nearly every single one of us hates the changes to raiding in Cataclysm, and talking about how they will most likely become a multiple 10-man raiding guild. <br />
<br />
I'm sick of seeing people try to forge logic about why some people dislike the changes as if they have any knowledge on the matter. This opinion is coming straight from someone who has raided virtually everything in BC and finished every fight but LK HM in WotLK. Hardcore no-lifers? Hardly. I've raided with guilds that mirror our raid schedule (Tues, Thurs, Sun 7-11PM -- We usually clear everything in the first night though, unless we're working on new content) and have had far less success. The changes are a blatant insult to anyone that enjoys a challenge and gets rewarded for their efforts. What makes it worse is how all the mouth breathers continue to act underprivileged while they parade around in their tier 10 badge sugar rush. <br />
<br />
If you don't raid 25-man content, you don't need 25-man gear. It's as simple as that. If you believe you do, you're a hypocrite if you dare state any argument that 25-man raiders are being greedy. They worked hard for what they have and to demand you get it too for your half-assed efforts is greedier than any 25-man raider will ever be. I hope you take pride in knowing that you're the 5-year old brats reaching up to their parent's cookie screaming &quot;I WANT ITTTT&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yesterday was...<br />
<br />
The amount of gear in the 25 person raids will be roughly equivalent on per-person basis to the 10 person raids.<br />
<br />
and today is...<br />
<br />
We're going to try instead offering more rewards (which includes loot) in the 25s<br />
<br />
They are as confused as we are hehe...Hopefully they get it done right in the end thought, that is what matters most.<br />
<br />
Not that confusing. Technically, there will be more loot dropping because there will be more people in the raid (25-man). For example, if the 10-man ratio was 1:1, the bosses would drop 10 pieces, so then the 25-man boss would drop 25 pieces. If they make it so the 25-man drops 100 items or something and the 10-man 1 item then I can see that being confusing between what each blue says.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you raid for the loot, then you raid for the wrong reason. Shut up.<br />
<br />
I agree with you on point A, if you have the same gear as a pugger then something is wrong. Even a moderate progression guild will have better gear then puggers.<br />
<br />
I dissagree with you on point B, I like many of the people in my guild and do stuff with them when not in raid. I like seeing new content, and the feeling of downing difficult bosses in heroic. That being said, if pretty purple pixles where not avliable, I wouldn't go. Getting phat loots is a major reason I raid, farm, and spend 15 bucks a month. Take that away, and I might as well cancle my account and play Aion where I can spend a month or two crafting my own phat loots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently the plan appears to be that normal achievements won't track whether the boss was killed on 10-man or 25-man, only whether it's been killed. I don't think Blizzard can really justify the Heroic achievements not being the same to the &quot;10-man raiding community&quot;.<br />
<br />
Once you get to the level cap the only way you can improve your character is through gear and maxing out professions so raiding for loot is understandable. Personally I raid because I enjoy it (and will raid on off nights pretty much anywhere I'm not saved, unless I'm tired).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe for you, but not for others. The big thing about wow is it appeals to many people. Some people just want to solo, other want to pvp, some just want to hang out their friends, hell there are people who just want to RP, and of course people who go to raids just for the loot. Your way is not necessarily the right way, if some one wants to raid just for loots that’s their prerogative, not yours stop trying to force your opinion on others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanra</div><div class="date">2010-06-17, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe that was a justifiable reason for delaying the launch of the Plagueworks in Icecrown Citadel by a month, but in my opinion, the phased implementation system in raids was horribly flawed since Trial of the Crusader.<br />
<br />
With Sunwell Plateau, it was justifiable. Five hard bosses, and you wanted to give these guilds an equal oppurtunity to take on each boss.<br />
<br />
It actually ruined Trial of the Crusader though. Defeating an effortlessly easy boss and then being told you have to wait another week is a disappointment. It may prolong raid content but in my opinion, heres how I think it should work<br />
<br />
Release the entire raid on patch day, no gating whatsoever. It worked for Ulduar.<br />
Allow players to access Heroic modes on individual bosses upon release immediately<br />
Make Normal mode bosses somewhat manageable even for less experienced raiders<br />
Make Heroic modes abnormally hard. Like to the point where you need good co-ordination and gear to stand a chance<br />
<br />
<br />
e.g. Cho'gall on Normal could be medium difficulty with a few surprises in store, but on Heroic difficulty, he could be a raidwiping behemoth.<br />
<br />
I think its a bit more complicated than that. Prolonging the time it takes to get the best gear in the game, keeps people paying. I know plenty of people who play til they get bored then cancel thier account. If you release content monthly or do something to change it up monthly, subscriptions will not be cancel and restarted when thier is more. It's a far better business practice to get people to log on for shorter periods for more often than long periods for less often.<br />
It's going to reduce server load, bandwith load, and other technical cost considerations.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has already stated thier extreme hardcore raiders are anywhere from 3-5% of the paying subscribers, you really don't want to build a game or content even around that small of a player base. Your hardcore players will still have better gear, items, resources, etc. They just wont have has much of a gap between them your casual players like they did in WoW 1.0, where it was virtually impossible to catch up (which upset alot of people enough to cancel). Now every player has an oppertunity to catch up every few months (which keeps them happier).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lumocolor</div><div class="date">2010-06-18, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not that confusing. Technically, there will be more loot dropping because there will be more people in the raid (25-man). For example, if the 10-man ratio was 1:1, the bosses would drop 10 pieces, so then the 25-man boss would drop 25 pieces. If they make it so the 25-man drops 100 items or something and the 10-man 1 item then I can see that being confusing between what each blue says.<br />
<br />
Equivalent means &quot;about the same amount&quot; to me (which would mean 2 in 10 man and 6 in 25 man are Equivalent). While MORE means MORE (which means 2 in 10 man and 8 in 25 man which is a larger percentage than that of 10 man).<br />
<br />
One blue post says &quot;MORE&quot; while the other blue post says &quot;the same amount&quot; as in 10 man.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and the reiteration of all that blue stuff was important, too... Woo, raiding. 25s. And stuff. ;)</div></div><hr />

Is that the only answer you can think of? Do you think you're funny? You're just proving our point to the max: You're an idiot.<br />

I agree with you on point A, if you have the same gear as a pugger then something is wrong. Even a moderate progression guild will have better gear then puggers.<br />
<br />
I dissagree with you on point B, I like many of the people in my guild and do stuff with them when not in raid. I like seeing new content, and the feeling of downing difficult bosses in heroic. That being said, if pretty purple pixles where not avliable, I wouldn't go. Getting phat loots is a major reason I raid, farm, and spend 15 bucks a month. Take that away, and I might as well cancle my account and play Aion where I can spend a month or two crafting my own phat loots.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ofcourse, the loot is the sugar in the cake, so to speak. It's the proof you achieved something.<br />
<br />
But I think we need to try it out before we can say what we think about it. The raiding model has changed in both previous expansions and it's changing one more time as they try their way with new ideas.<br />
I don't raid anymore myself, but that's due to time pressure and me being awfully tired of dealing with incompetent people.<br />
<br />
But the consensus of what I'm saying is this.<br />

<br />
World of Warcraft is changing into something more mainstream and casual, something everyone can pick up and do. And in my own opinion, playing mostly or only WoW makes it tedious and boring. I round it up with other games and try to do other things, something I wish alot more people did because they're really way too serious some times. It's just a game after all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">good diu bro</div><div class="date">2010-06-18, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am doing 25mans with guild and 10man with friends, most of my guildies are doing the same.<br />
10 and 25 in the same lock out is just bull s**t...<br />
I guess in cata only the hardcore guild will still be running 25mans and most guilds will have their 25man disbanded... <br />
How can we find 25 skilled raider without doing 10man and given that fact that 10 man progress is alot easier... Thats just too bad...</div></div><hr />
