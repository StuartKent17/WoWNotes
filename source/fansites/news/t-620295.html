Wrath of the Lich King - World Event<br />
As I write this news, it looks like the pre-Wrath of the Lich King world event has been started on one of the US live servers, we're still unsure if it's just an error or if Blizzard is testing the event on a few servers. Below is a small preview of what to expect during this event .... You can probably expect more updates in the next hours if the event is extended to all realms.<br />
<br />
Zombies will randomly spawn in the world (and near cities) and infect anyone they damage.<br />
People infected by zombies can either get cured by other players or by Argent Healers deployed in most of the zones.<br />
If a player or NPC isn't cured within 10 minutes ... He will turn into a zombie ! <br />
Players changed into zombies have access to a new set of skills (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/october/wotlkworldevent_7.jpg) to let them attack and infect other players. They become friendly with other zombies and hostile to all player factions. <br />
<br />
Also ...<br />
Don't waste your time finding and creating a level 1 on this server, being hostile with all player factions also means that guards will kill you on sight and pretty much instantly in the case of a level 1 character.<br />
This is probably just the first part of the world event, it doesn't look fully deployed at all<br />
<br />
You might want to get ready for some serious zombie invasion in the next days ....<br />
<br />

Naa, the buff takes to long to spread, you move too slow as a zombie and other players strike you down in 2 seconds. <br />

<br />
<br />
1. You slowly take damage until you die, like a slowly constantly ticking DoT.<br />
<br />
2. When you die, you release from your corpse, taking durability damage (at least, we did, though we were mainly killed by NPCs).<br />
<br />
3.You can't. You're an enemy to everything and everyone. You will most likely be murdered upon site by anyone in any city or town.<br />
<br />
4. You can still /whisper and talk in raid/party, but in /say, your text will come up as [Zombie], like [Orcish] or [Draenic].<br />
<br />
Confirmed information as of 00:41 GMT on Darkmoon Faire EU (RP realm).<br />
<br />
We also tried infecting Varian Wrynn and the Archbishop in Stormwind. Archbishop was a success, Varian was not. He has a healer beside him, which will stun/oneshot you along with Wrynn and all of his spawning guards.<br />
<br />
The Archbishop was infected and only unfortunately turned into a level 70 generic zombie, as will all other NPCs (I assume).<br />
<br />
Will post more information as necessary.<br />
<br />
As of this current time, all you need to do to infect someone is use Mangle, or have someone stand in your disease cloud long enough. This goes for raid bosses too.<br />
<br />
And the level of the zombie will depend on the level of the actual character--anything at level 70 or above will turn into a level 70 zombie--we infected the Masked Matron in Goldshire, she turned into a level 10 Zombie. Others turned into level 20s, 30s, etc.</div></div><hr />

In Plaguelands your hp as a Zombie don't get low, every mob is friendly to you. Maybe there is some new quest's in Stratholme who knows :) . Need more investigating.<br />

I almost hurt myself laughing seeing all the battlemasters turn on the players there and players wandering around and wondering wtf is going on.<br />
<br />
Also, a correction. You should not take durability. I was attacked by both players and NPCs and i've yet to take any when i've died.<br />
<br />
This event so far seems completely player driven, so don't hang around cities expecting mass zombies to come (at least there's no sign of that yet), it's purely players and npcs that have turned.</div></div><hr />

I want to take part, but the heart of me says no, don't take the bait, there is something fishy about this event. However that leads to two very important questions... <br />
<br />
A) How do we combat this evil plague upon our land, should be be killing massive ammounts of zombies as we can? Has anyone found any quests; like at Andorhal? <br />
<br />
B) If we accidently get infected, would this somehow hurt us down the road, I know this may or not spoil things, but if there is nothing substantional planned if you are didn't become infected, it'd be nice to know so you could accidently get infected, and not worry that you spoil a bigger fun later. <br />

Me and some guildies went to Strat, and walked all the way up to Baron as zombies. You can't unlock the doors in zombie form, but you can open every gate inside... and walk right up to him. So it's basically the fastest Baron run you could ever be on.<br />

When I got to her room I waited &amp; turned into a zombie, luckily for me sitting in the middle of the room didnt aggro her with no ability to talk to anyone, BUT Varimathras ( the big dude with wings ) disappeared!

<br />
2nd do my stats stay the same, so if i wear 400+ resi gear i can solo other lvl 70 players? get owned<br />
<br />
3d how will a 1vs1 look zombie vs player, easy from zombie point of view or impossible? get owned<br />
<br />
4th. Do i get Hks for killing players while in Zombie? (still need 47k for the title)<br />
<br />
coz if its all negative then i think ill go back to the days of defending uthers tomb and cleanse the world off all zombies</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Numbers numbers numbers #'s 1v1 against non-ghouls you are toast. Stay clear of Ret Pallies. They will rock you and your 3 ghoul friends world. 10+ is a very good number of ghoul buddies to have.<br />
2. Wear as much spell power as possible. Attack power gives you negative attack power as a ghoul. Spell power gives you more attack power as a ghoul. (Unsure if this is a bug with phy attack power. :-[ )<br />
3. Find some humanoid npcs near were you and your ghoul buddies can get reinfected in the event that you meet your ghoulish end.<br />
4. You don't need to kill a player to turn them to a ghoul quickly. The more ghouls attacking the player the faster they can be converted. If you have 10 people that are ghouls all attacking the same person, that person will turn in just a few seconds.<br />
5. Stay close to each other. Lurch affects all ghouls in a small area near the person that used lurch. With enough people you can affectively chain lurches to keep from being slowed or snared.<br />
6. Causing paladins to bubble or mages to ice block is a good thing. As soon as their immunity wears off they instantly turn into a ghoul.<br />
<br />
Yaarrrgghhhhlll</div></div><hr />
