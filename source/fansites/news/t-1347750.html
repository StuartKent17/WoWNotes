Heroic Norushen Changes<br />
I entirely understand the frustration felt by guilds that have already defeated Heroic Norushen this week, or invested significant time attempting his current incarnation. It's never particularly enjoyable to have to relearn a fight you've already defeated and from which you've already received loot and an achievement. Changing an encounter meaningfully once it's in players' hands is not an action we take lightly. I'd like to offer a few general points of clarification:<br />
<br />
First, we did read and closely consider all feedback received as a result of Norushen PTR testing. We made a number of adjustments to the encounter as a result of both player feedback and our own observations over the course of testing. Notably, we removed the Draw mechanic that was present for most of the PTR testing cycle, since it caused players to have to throttle their damage as their gear and execution improved. That mechanic was originally added to completely shut down any chance of a brute-force approach, but we believed that the damage penalty from the initial Corruption would be sufficient to require players to use Look Within to purify themselves in order to meet the berserk timer. Clearly we were mistaken, and I'd like to personally apologize for that. <br />
<br />
Second, we are not looking to meaningfully increase the difficulty of the encounter. It should, on balance, be a small to moderate step up in difficulty from Heroic Fallen Protectors, and should be easier than Sha of Pride. While we're still iterating on the exact changes, they will likely entail something along the lines of entirely removing the additional pulsed Corruption received from Burst of Anger and Residual Corruption, increasing players' starting Corruption to 75 as is the case on Normal, and adjusting the health of the Amalgam accordingly. We don't expect that most guilds that defeat the encounter this week will experience any notable struggles with the revised version.<br />
<br />
Third, in keeping with the general philosophies laid out in the Encounter Tuning Dev Watercooler (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/8445111/), a major factor when it comes to deciding whether to make changes to address an unintended strategy is whether the approach actually involves interesting gameplay. Yes, a really tight Patchwerk-style DPS check absolutely can be fun even without any other mechanics involved, and many players had nailbiting kills and wipes on the encounter this week. But in a few more weeks, with a bit more gear, that fun would largely be gone. And for the healers that most raid groups benched in order to add damage-dealers to meet the DPS check, it likely was never there to begin with. Ultimately, this is a change made for the sake of the thousands of guilds that have yet to attempt the encounter, but will in the future. To those who are experiencing the disruption of having the boss change mid-progress, I again apologize. There are many parallels to our handling of Heroic Primordius (and, yes, those parallels do begin with us screwing up the tuning in the first place).<br />
<br />
Finally, I've seen a few references in this thread, and elsewhere, to Thok. The change made to Thok last week was entirely a bugfix. Based on our final days of Raid Finder testing on PTR, we decided to completely disable the Acceleration mechanic that increases Thok's energy generation in Raid Finder, since he changes phases based on health % thresholds in that mode. That change inadvertently removed the mechanic from all difficulties, and the 20-hour time period for which the bug was active represents the time it took us to track down the cause, implement a fix, and test that fix before applying it to the live environment. Thok's current energy regen rate is identical to the values seen for the better part of PTR testing. Had we changed nothing, Thok would have been the easiest encounter in the zone rather than one of the more challenging ones, and we are always going to fix bugs that completely trivialize raid encounters. That was a bug that we fixed ASAP. The upcoming Norushen adjustments, however, are design changes that we're going to roll out along with raid resets next week so that they affect everyone equally.<br />

<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Item Level Squish<br />
so essentially everything will feel the same? We'll just be putting out smaller numbers?<br />
Exactly. If it takes you 6 seconds to kill a level 90 mob, it still will post squish. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/380451492525641729))<br />
<br />
is there no sense at all that 30 ilvls per tier or equivalent is excessive?<br />
At max level, no. If the numbers don't jump by that amount, the gear feels like side grades. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/379725943389970432))<br />
<br />
Raid Finder<br />
Why delay it? But OK for normal/heroic to blaze through everything in one week.<br />
Your argument would be apples to apples if only 1% of LFR players would blaze through in one week. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/381499029068083200))<br />
<br />
Have you ever thought about ex: &quot;You were present the entire fight, here's an extra bonus roll&quot; in LFR to deter afks?<br />
Yeah, we just have to be careful about detecting that to not punish legit players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377198343002136577))<br />
<br />
Hey Greg, any thoughts on gating LFR wings more heavily in future expansions? Influence people to try organized raiding(?).<br />
What we have found historically is the LFR players just don't raid, or even don't play if there isn't enough content. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375298480685596672))<br />
We'd love to encourage more players to try organized raiding, but I think we have to lure them in, not beat them in. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375298595299147778))<br />
<br />
Your purposely trying to push aside people that use LFR as there only means to see content. Way to stick people in a box.<br />
I'm confused. That's not what we're trying to do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374953348383772672))<br />
We would like someone who has run many LFRs to consider Flex for better loot now that they know the fights pretty well. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374953419762454528))<br />
Why? If i am happy in lfr why do you want to push me out of it?<br />
Because it provides you more content. Compare: Run LFR until finished vs. Run LFR until finished, THEN run Flex. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374971284221747201))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
You got a mess on your hands with mobs of 40-50 blood coin raids killing people tryin to farm coins. Huge backlash.<br />
You only earn coins on KBs (by design) so forming big raids isn't super efficient. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378964489623707648))<br />
<br />
on the topic of PVP being a battle to balance, why not take a queue from Riot and do very small, weekly changes?<br />
It's just a different approach. LoL has 4ish abilities per champion, so you are rarely re-learning whole rotations when they patch. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375304041464463360))<br />
For us, small number tweaks rarely cause major differences in PvP. Things like CC, survival or burst move the meter more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375304236466044928))<br />
<br />
Regarding PvP? Don't listen to forums. Try to get some in depth from established, skilled legitimate players<br />
We actually do, but that doesn't help the 99% out there who want to be heard but have their message get lost in the noise. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374993861010927616))<br />
Trust your own experienced developers instead of forums. Cant democratize art. Too Many Cooks Spoil the Broth<br />
We agree, and this isn't a democratic process, but we do like to gather feedback to make informed decisions. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375302543057760258))<br />
The process of gathering feedback is made less efficient when players over-reward shallow points or squelch dissent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375303057707241472))<br />
<br />
so why does below 90 pvp don't matter? hunters disc, dks all broken, fix their scaling for 85+ please op/not fun/imbalanced<br />
It matters. It just matters less than max level, which is what by far most players express concern about. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373973739743879168))<br />
<br />
How is that any different from normal pvp gear being required to compete in pvp?<br />
Presumably a PvP legendary would come with a process more involved than normal Conq gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/381498442553389057))<br />
Which makes me ask what would the motivation for PvP gear taking longer to acquire? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/381498537986359296))<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds<br />
in Top100 healers on proving grounds there are only 5 priests, dont you find it a bit strange for class with 2 healing specs?<br />
Like any encounter, the specific PG mechanics are more favorable to some specs than others. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378964025905655808))<br />
We could make spec-specific tweaks, but does that violate the spirit of PG? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378964138195558400))<br />
<br />
Timeless Isle<br />
The albatross taxi service on timeless isle is the single most frustrating and annoying thing implemented in WoW.<br />
If that's truly the case, then I'd say we're doing pretty well overall. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378556159356989440))<br />
Also a sad commentary that players would rather kill something than see another player benefit from it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378556342681620480))<br />
<br />
do you think the emperor shaohao rep is a little over bearing? Or is there something missing, daily quests not giving rep..<br />
Path of the Mistwalker will soon provide some rep. Overall though that rep is intended as a long term goal and investment. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378282594841800704))<br />

I enjoyed 5.1 the most, loved those unique quests every couple days that actually moved the story along and expanded on specific characters of my faction.<br />
<br />
5.2 Isle of Thunder progression should just apply to all zones, for example: have about 5 max-lvl zones with 4 closed and 1 available for progression, after a week or two (like thunder isle) the realm would complete the zone and move onto the next. The last zone would be unlocked just in time before the next patch with 2 more zones! :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MatadorMedia</div><div class="date">2013-09-22, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This poll is skewed toward 5.4 only because it's still new.<br />
<br />
Wait til people have been on the isle for a couple months, and they'll realize there is so little to do.<br />
<br />
Throne of Thunder and the daily island was the best, even though nothing this expansion was really &quot;great.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aleom</div><div class="date">2013-09-22, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Norushen is broken not because it's a DPS check, but because you can simply zerg the boss and completely ignore any of the mechanics that the designers clearly intended you do use. <br />
<br />
You're SUPPOSED to send people down to cleans their corruption so they can come back and do more damage, but as the fight stands right now, you can just use 4-5 healers, stack and DPS the boss down while completely ignoring the intended mechanics. People aren't upset that it's an easily doable DPS check (for non-bads) people are upset that you can literally ignore half the fight.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MysticalOS</div><div class="date">2013-09-22, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That poll is skewed right now because timeless isle is fresh while everything else had a long cycle. I'd be willing to bet in 6 months that poll will have drastically different results. Timeless isle doesn't seem like it has nearly the longevity of isle of thunder's server coop gating. you can only grind out rares and mobs for so long before it's mindless and boring. I think timeless isle will prove that it's a nice experiment for short term content but it doesn't against the trial of time. I think they need to find a middle ground between timeless isle and isle of thunder to get it right.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nobleshield</div><div class="date">2013-09-22, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is so bad about the gear feeling like sidegrades? It seems like it's very important to the devs to make clear cut delineations between tiers, instead of actually encouraging people to progress at their own pace. If there was only say a 6-iLevel difference between tiers (as opposed to 13 like present, not counting Heroic and Thunder/Warforged), why is that such a bad thing?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sergel02</div><div class="date">2013-09-22, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mix the daily system of 5.1, the scenarios and questing from 5.2, and the exploration stuff of 5.4 and I'd be very happy.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sylreick</div><div class="date">2013-09-22, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the storyline of 5.1, the solo scenarios of Thunder Isle, and the chaotic killing of rares/minor quests leading around the Timeless Isle. Hated the repetitive dailies in 5.1, didn't bother with them on Thunder Isle because assumed they were also repetitive and dull. The battlefield barrens wasn't terrible, but the feeling of grinding was compounded on those quests requiring items off kills, the way timeless isle handles this is better.<br />
<br />
If they can combine a great story like the one during 5.1 with a solo scenario experience like isle of thunder, and provide rare killing of timeless isle (plus a few dailies to complement the action happening), it would be fantastic.</div></div><hr />

There was a huge variety of quests and factions, and I found myself doing different things and going to different zones, every day of the week. One day it would be Halfhill and Tillers, another day it was off to Townlong for the Shado-Pan quests. August Celestials in one of four different locations. Anglers once or twice a week. And so on. It was great.<br />

By comparison, the other patches were far more limited. Although I still enjoyed them.</div></div><hr />

This whole entire expansion has been about dailies. This is the first patch that doesn't make you do constant daily quests. I quit WoW for almost a year, and once I heard there wasn't going to be that many dailies I came back. This is a fun way to get everyone in one place, where you can work together to kill over 25 elite monsters that constantly spawn, weekly quests for killing elites and etc. This island is the one thing I hope they do again in the future. Your WoW experience shouldn't be spent by doing dailies for 1/2 hour to 2 hours each day, I for one don't want another expansion filled with dailies. Lets get back to the roots of the game. I'd rather rep grind in instance by killing everything like back in Classic and BC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as the &quot;important&quot; things... I actually enjoy the Timeless isle. Turning on your censer and going full out against anyone and everyone is refreshing, compared to the other patches of content. Only the Isle of Thunder can compete (and honestly the gating for that was more obnoxious than anything.)</div></div><hr />

I don't like dailies very much, but I did them there until it was fully unlocked and/or until I got all the achievements. <br />
i haven't played much in the timeless isle, but from what i have played, i don't like it as much as the isle of thunder. i like quests, whether they are dailies or not, because i know there is things to do. and there's not many of them on timeless isle. i go there, run around and then hearthstone again.</div></div><hr />

Why? 5.4 brought with it super easy gear, which is always well received by players. In addition, with how punitive it has been to gear alts in MOP, it probably skews it even more favorably because it's a welcome change.<br />
<br />
Of *course* loot isle is going to be #1. Of *course*.<br />
<br />
OT: For me, it's a tie between 5.1 and 5.4. I feel they finally got dailies just right in 5.1, it was actually fun and the storyline moved along fast enough that I didn't get bored but also it didn't feel *too* fast. I enjoyed seeing things progress, and the rewards felt like a nice bonus.<br />
<br />
With 5.4, I think the loot comes far too easily, personally; when I heard about the BOA Timeless pieces I figured you'd get maybe 1-2 a week if you were lucky. But nope, they rain down like candy. So that feels a little too easy. Add to that the &quot;rares&quot; that spawn once every half hour or so, and the zergable bosses, and it all sort of feels like the gear is being handed to me.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I like that the mobs on the isle actually present a challenge. It's nice to have to pay attention to abilities again, and I can easily get killed on a non-tank (on my main, a bear, it's a little tougher but I still can't just coast along). Been farming Crimson Drakes for Quivering Eggs and I like that I have to think, not stand in things, and occasionally use a cooldown or heal up. It's nice to not be able to just mindlessly mow down quest mobs. Though I do think some of the mobs are a little too punitive (Gulp Frogs I'm looking in your direction).</div></div><hr />

NO. I hated dailies. I hated that I couldn't just run dungeons for VP then buy VP gear to get geared enough to go to LFR on my alts, without ALSO running the god DAMNED dailies over and over again until I had enough rep so that they'd *deign* to let my purchase gear with the VP I'd already earned. <br />
<br />
The Barrens thing was better. At least a little. Timeless Isle is MUCH better - I might actually start playing my alts again after spending most of the expansion refusing to.</div></div><hr />

A lot of times it feels like the lore behind each new patch took place in some short story I never read so it was nice to actually experience the story in the game - what a novel idea!<br />
<br />
The 5.3 scenarios set up parts of 5.4 but they still felt too short, rushed, and doing them 20 times made them feel less epic.</div></div><hr />

It's the newest content which makes people weigh it more heavily by design. Think about it...what do you remember about past content? Probably the stuff you enjoyed, but also probably the stuff that you got really sick of. Right now only a handful of people are really sick of the isle.</div></div><hr />

As for the poll, 5.1 was my favorite. The combination of story telling and dalies was engaging, yet not over bearing like 5.0. 5.2 I didnt like the zone, but I did like the scenarios. 5.3 was too little and 5.4 I'm not sure about yet. <br />
<br />
I cant say I'm a fan of needing to be in a group to get anything done there outside of killing some of the smaller elites. By the time you get to a rare that someone called out in /1 its already dead. Doesnt feel like there is anything to do there except kill things. No story, nothing to move forward.</div></div><hr />

I think they are about to stream Paragons of the Klaxxi, couse AngrybirdsTW just went live on Twich. They did same with Blackfuse right after Thok was down, and they streamed for 2-3 hours till they got some clue of the fight, and after that they stoped streaming.<br />
<br />
Update&gt; He is currently not in raid, as they for some reason dont want any druid for Klaxxi fight. If they change their mind and he gets in the raid, he will stream.</div></div><hr />

That is what I think the devs are missing.. they always have this all-or-nothing attitude. The probelm with 5.0 wasn´t dailies.. it was SO MANY GOLDEN LOTUS DAILIES.. There should always be a mix of things.. Storytelling dailies with scenario arcs like in 5.1, unlocking content like Isle of thunder, and then just a bunch of little cool things like timeless island.<br />
<br />
Golden Lotus was terrible, the rest of the 5.0 dailies were fine. <br />

Because it provides you more content. Compare: Run LFR until finished vs. Run LFR until finished, THEN run Flex.<br />
<br />
It's not more content at all. That's simply saying, you killed these 2 goats by the BMAH, now run around to the other side of the hut and kill 2 more goats, oh but this time i'll fight them at the same time!?!). Rubbish.

<br />
Albatroz: hit it, it will become a faction vehicle that can only be attack by the player on it or opposite faction. Faction pvp kept, plus, no more griefing.<br />
<br />
Blood Coins: You get rewarded for fighting ordon and his followers. If a player uses the item and become an ordon emissary (as stated), he should naturally also give other players some kind of reward. It is that simple. Right now it fails because there is nothing on it for other players to hunt them. The isle is kinda of fast paced with all the rare hunting and etc. so most players prefer to just try to avoid that kind of &quot;pvp&quot; since they get nothing from it other than getting slowed. Not to mention that some classes (*cof*rogues*cof*) just get it all easy since they can just leave the fight if they're not going to win it after &quot;stun locking&quot; someone (I would put some kind of huge penalty given by Ordon for being a coward and leaving the current fight hahaha don't think that the big guy like coward followers since his npcs friends fight all the way. Like a insta kill fire from the sky for running away lol).<br />
<br />
Be it some reputation, some kind of opposite currency or just extra timeless coins (the item has a CD, so hardly an exploit, just like a player killed by them get a 10 min debuff to not grant more blood coins). Just give some nice motivation to kill blood coin farmers and let the hunt/fun begins. Countless times in wow, it was proven that one-sided fun was never good.<br />
<br />
And still find horrendous that Blizzard still try to shove on us that dificult settings = new content...<br />
Ra Den = new content.<br />
Immersius LFR/Flex/Normal/Heroic = same content.<br />

challenge =/= content.</div></div><hr />

(Or maybe 5.4 is just that much better than everything else this patch.)<br />
<br />
5.0 was great for variety, but ended up being too much work to get anywhere. Along with having gating a few reps to extend the pain and suffering.<br />
5.1 had a great storytelling aspect. It definitely felt like you were progressing and the solo senario's worked well. The patch lacked real content though.<br />
5.2 was insane to start. Too many people crammed in such a small space. The solo senarios did a decent job telling the story, but they felt a little boring (maybe the story just wasn't that good.) As the island opened up, I started to enjoy the dailies more. The gating was a waste though. You unlocked a world boss and different dailies. Not very exciting.<br />
5.3 was good. A decent storyline, along with a pretty simple catch up mechanic for alts. There wasn't a ton of content, but it was done well in my opinion.<br />
5.4 is a waste of time. It doesn't add anything to the story of the expansion. All you do is kill anything that moves. Its good for people who like to grind. It gives people the option to burn through the content as quickly as they like, without being gated by daily quests. It's not really for me. Too many people in a small area fighting over the same mobs. It seems to bring out the worst the game has to offer.</div></div><hr />

Sure I got loot for my alts, but it's kind of pointless. What am I gonna do on them? LFR?</div></div><hr />

Stumble around on an island opening chests for epic gear, what a fucking joke. This is what they came up with after saying 5-mans were &quot;too easy to gear up in&quot;.<br />
I'll bet some intern got a pat on the back for coming up with the idea of zero quest lines or story on the island and calling it &quot;player directed&quot;.<br />
And hey let's not forget making areas &quot;exclusive&quot; with access only if you have the right gear, got to get people to do the RNG clusterfuck that the legendary quest line is somehow I guess.<br />
What they have done to professions is beyond stupid. Blathering about getting people out in the world while removing any need to do so for mats and turning them into a daily RNG pile of shit.<br />
<br />
This dev team that took over mid Wrath is destroying the game and in the process they are removing just about every single thing the previous team did that made the game so popular, kind of like that new grocery store manager who moves everything around just to show everyone who's the boss.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping one of the new games coming out don't suck ass.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't matter anyways because their 25m geared players could probably just go faceroll 10m.</div></div><hr />

This is a really powerful story same like quest for Anduin Wrynn. Actly, all of Operation: Shieldwall. <br />
Black Prince got me perfectly to fight, his dialogues are excellent. I would like to experience something similar in the future.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I felt like I was actually part of the storyline and it felt like we had to slowly gain trust with the Pandaren before being allowed to tackle some of the real issues that faced the continent.<br />
<br />
The same goes for 5.1 except that we were facing off against the opposite faction and the Mogu in a race for an item of power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I spent quite some time there...but I didn't enjoy a minute.<br />
<br />
I like the timeless isle. Some interesting new mechanics(for open world PvE and PvP) and a lot to discover. <br />
Okay, the reputation grind was uncalled for(yes, you don't have to do it...on the other hand: Stupid grinding is NO content, Blizz!!!)....no idea why hunters and warlocks get a free ride when it comes to solo killing whatever they want on the isle due to easy mode tanking pets(and that after Blizz already had the same problem mit zandalari warbringers. You'd think they learned out of that)...and the bird-taxi could fly A LOT faster....but that's about all the things I can complain about. <br />
I'm on a completely dead server(and server pool) tho...so I can see it all without of getting killed every 5 minutes and I only have to fight for rep-mobs at high traffic(means 50 players are online) hours...and usually I'm then competing with xrealm players that try to farm on my server.</div></div><hr />

I tell you what is world PvP right now: 60+ players standing all in one place, spamming AoE, and everyone and everything around are lagging like hell. This is your &quot;world PvP&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't like Timeless Isle. It's just non stop killing everything around. Very boring.<br />
<br />
Way to not talk about PvP</div></div><hr />

I thought Asia doesn't count because they don't have the 10/25 lockout?</div></div><hr />

First three patches were about dailies. Last two were about non-dailies. So compare first 3 vs. last 2 - it comes up almost even. A few more people like non-daily content, but not nearly such a huge majority.</div></div><hr />
