Legion - Wardrobe UI<br />
The new Wardrobe tab in Legion will help with your transmog sets!<br />
<br />
<br />
Select an item slot from the top menu, including enchants.<br />
Then scroll through all of the available appearances for that slot.<br />
Hovering over an appearance tells you the item name, source, and other items that use the same appearance. <br />
The top bar tells you how many of the available appearances you have unlocked. <br />
You can search by name and use various filters. <br />
You can save each set and link them to other players.<br />
<br />

If I had a key I'd &quot;test&quot; the shit out of that.<br />
<br />
But nope, no Wow, no Overwatch. No Beta key luck for me.<br />
If I remember right the only time I got a Beta invite was MoP when it was guaranteed with the annual pass. And even then I was in one of the last waves.<br />
<br />
P.s. Ah, almost forgot, I bought myself into HotS beta. Not really an invite though as everyone could buy beta access at that point.</div></div><hr />

Don't take it personally the first good chunk of ALL their betas seem to be 95percent streamers that probably are just given it to create hype rather than actually test and give feed back. The other 5percent is like winning the lottery.</div></div><hr />

Worst. Decision. Ever. There goes any hope of having her removed from the game. Why, oh why, do you always take a turn for the worse.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2015-11-23, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I'll admit I was thinking Varian would die, I didn't think Blizzard would do it. I could have sworn during the cinematics panel at Blizzcon, they showed a cinematic that was later in the game (looked like it could be Suramar). So either Varian's not dead and they THOUGHT he was (I.E. Bolvar) ... or Varian was a placeholder in the cinematic with Anduin actually being in it, not his father.<br />
<br />
I would have thought it'd be an interesting role reversal to have Anduin leading the Army of the Light and his father playing his second-in-command. It could have been a show of Varian beginning to step back and Anduin forward, but I guess Blizzard is going with the cop out by killing Varian to get Anduin to step up instead. Hopefully it's just a Bolvar situation and we rescue Varian later alive and well albeit a bit worse for wear. Could have sworn there was a mission to rescue someone (not the Tirion one for paladins) so possible Varian is related to that.<br />
<br />
Besides, why kill Varian if warriors aren't getting his sword(s) for their artifact. &gt;_&gt; That's just cheap or suggests he's not dead after all. Giving warriors some no name artifacts instead rather than give fury or arms the sword of the late king is a strange move if he is dead.</div></div><hr />

You are joking right?

I just said I didn't believe it'd happen, Varian maybe be a jerk character but at least he had a good enough story-line that evolved into a character advancement and that I believe he shouldn't have died. It was all speculation, he survived during the initial fall. I never said Anduin wouldn't be able to come to the Broken isles and I think for reason why I thought this was because, he could come. He could come looking for his father to retrieve him and bring him back, because unlike the first time Varian was taken, his son was young. And now that Anduin is older he could be coming to take his father, but that was my hope for the way it'd gone. I'm just disappointed and sad that they killed off a good character just for the advancement of another. With this said, I am happy you replied but I didn't mean to appear rude, or a fan-girl, or a bit of a sarcastic person. I was just saying my piece but if it's so &quot;Triggering&quot; then I am sorry. :\ Otherwise, as said. Information looks great, pretty excited, but also annoyed since they're killing off more characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn't they have given Vol'jin SOMETHING to do before pushing him offstage? Sylvanas as Warchief is interesting, because of Wrathgate, but jesus christ on a pogo stick, he's barely had time to warm up the seat on the throne. <br />
<br />
But Anduin, as leader of the Alliance? Fuck. That. He's weak. He's not a leader. He's wimpier than Jaina pre-mana bomb. The only good that can come from this is him dying a gruesome death. Kind of like how Joffrey was tolerable, because I knew his sociopathic ass was a goner eventually. That, and Wrathion has spent far too much time with him. <br />
<br />
I'm bouncing around complete disinterest/apathy when it comes to playing again, the Anduin thing makes my interest drop even further. I just don't care about him. I dislike his character, and role in the game. If I do ever return, it will have to be horde now. <br />
<br />
And yes, I know it's just a game, I'm only a little serious, and mostly sarcastic. I just don't think Kosak and crew know how to write good, engaging Alliance characters. Jana showed promise, but now she's off playing footsie with a dragon, instead of being interesting. That just can't seem to let Alliance characters be interesting, like Horde characters. Thus we get Grom taking the victory lap for Hellfire, instead of spitting up blood when Yrel bashes his ribcage in.</div></div><hr />

That's too bad, I was in the TBC beta, it was like that alpha in the beginning - it only got bad when they let more people in later to stress test. I had some awesome conversations in Shattrath during the beta, everyone was excited to share what they found. <br />

<br />
It was not a bad choice. I would guess that he would be out there, stalking someone/someting, and returning later with a revelation. <br />
<br />
I also would expect Varian to come back. What a mess. First, Blizzard sacrifices Jaina so Varian can become a better man (and she instead becomes the warmonger). Now, they sacrifice Varian. This feels too soon, while Garrosh could not die soon enough for me.<br />
<br />
Well, I expect the Night Elves to lead the Alliance in Legion if things turn out that way. They should have the best knowledge of the whole territory.</div></div><hr />

Wich is the oposite of what a site like mmochampion wants. They want visitors/clicks. If most people stop visiting because of the spoilers, things go bad for the site.<br />

<br />
Is this what we're expecting from Legion? World of Skincraft?<br />
<br />
Recolors were cool for PvP, specs, and old gear that got upgrades. Why are they wasting so much resources trying to please people that don't exist? All these artifact reskins could be added later, or trickled in to keep things fresh.<br />
<br />
They'll never replicate the &quot;effort&quot; it took to for Tier 0.5 (Dungeon2.0) sets/attunement which were ultimately just recolors and something for non-raiders. Even doing BC heroics for Vanilla reskins felt meaningful. After all, they made sure to remind people that did it they're not special, but people who solo afk farmed honor for PvP ranks do.<br />
<br />
Oh what the hell I'm still gonna make a crack anyway: They're practically giving away any type of identity Warrior has/had. &quot;You get Warrior stuff! You get Warrior stuff! Everybody except Warriors gets Warrior stuff!&quot;</div></div><hr />

The variation on the guns is so extreme. You go from the basic one which looks like a super boring regular white-quality rifle from vanilla. To adding a sniper scope onto it, to that ugly elephant cannon (it can't just be be who sees the one with the skull and the tusks and think the barrel looks like an elephant trunk), to that kinda cool pistol with the blade attached, to... whatever that dragon thing is. Is it a sideways crossbow? I don't know what it is, but I love it.<br />
<br />
And why is Sylvanas of all people being made the replacement Warchief? She hasn't had any involvement in Horde affairs since Cata, and that was strictly her own homeland affairs anyway. It seems like the Horde vice-warchief who takes over when Vol'jin is unable ot perform his duties would be Baine. Easily. And after him, Lor'themar. They both were heavily involved in Horde events recently. Like, you know, that whole rebellion. (Wait, now that I think about it, wasn't Sylvie in the Galakras fight in SoO? Okay, but that was it since Cata.) And of course, this is all only counting the specific racial leaders and discounting any other potential leaders stepping up, like say, Eitrigg or Saurfang. Or, I don't know, THRALL?<br />
<br />
Finally, some of the names on that list are a little surprising. Magni's back? Calia Menethil? Wow, where'd that come from? Can't wait to see where she's been for 10 years. We knew we were going to see Turalyon and Hunka Hunka Burnin' Bolvar, but Broxigar? Isn't he dead? Like Lothar and Llane Wrynn.</div></div><hr />

Yep completely true, especially for prot warriors who have almost nothing special in the identity department anymore and where basically the only tank that had nothing done towards their fantasy this expansion. Oh you where the mobile tank ok lets give other tanks mobility and then make a new tanking class that is much more mobile while taking away one of your mobility abilities, oh and while we are at it lets make it hard for you to do anything but main tank because your back to needing to be hit to get any meaningful amount of rage quickly.</div></div><hr />

So what? Wait for the story and then you can complain. Saurfang was never interested in leading the Horde(as far as I could see)...Thrall is seeing himself in a different role as well(which is why he stepped back afterall). If I'm thinking of a leader and have to choose between Sylvannas, Baine, Lor'themar and even Vol'jin...I'd go with Sylvannas hands down. She has much more experience in leading her people in many different situations(unlike Baine, who is new...and Lor'themar who had his people shut off from the world for quite a while..and who was actually second-in-command to Sylvannas during the second war. So he was already back then just second best). Leading seems to be much more natural for her than for the others. Last but not least she is just the way more interesting character cause she seems to be ruthless(although very caring for her people) and she is UNDEAD...which allows Blizz some nice twists and turns in the story. She is just way less predictable than some boring Baine. Let's hope Blizz does not waste that chance tho.<br />
<br />
You noticed that Valhalla is not exactly unimportant for Legion? You know, that place where dead heroes go? And you notice that we deal with valkyries and Sylvannas(who definitely is up for something if she wants to become warchief)? Whoever is dead, may show up as a soul in Legion...or an undead. Nobody says, that they have to be alive to appear. :-)<br />
<br />
Just give Blizz the chance to tell the story. Sylvannas is potentially more interesting than Vol'jin(who may come back later...hopefully not as warchief again or he needs to get some serious edges in between. So far the only situation where I took him for serious as warchief was right after stepping on the throne)....and Varian comming back as undead or deathknight or something would be interesting too. There are a lot of interesting options. The only really negative thing is Anduin. He is such a &quot;he unites them all and they lived happy ever after&quot;-character, that I feel sorry for alliance players there. Sure, Wrathion will get involved there sooner or later...but untill then the alliance is stuck with him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sabrewulf</div><div class="date">2015-11-26, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After seeing the other high quality items I'd say the hunter class got the big shaft. The BM gun looks basic and there is nothing epic about the designs. The current WoD designs look more epic now than the upcoming Epic Artifact designs, no seriously, how can you say the new gun Artifact items look or feel more Epic than the current WoD Challenge Mode items? Also comparing the quality to the other class items (I know they cant match the Epicness of say Ashbringer but come on) I just dont see how they can see where the models they have are as near in quality as the other classes. I hope they look at these boards and still have time to do something different, because as they are now, the gun models sux. Even the survival hunter's spear just doesn't scream Epic Artifact to me but i'll say it looks better than the gun model, but really, come on blizz show some more Epic design love.<br />
<br />
I'll also say that I think Thematically the gun should go to the MM spec as hiding in the shadows snipping your prey using a gun seems more to go with the Theme of that spec. I'd even throw out the idea that the Artifact item for the hunter BM spec should be the pet .... if they are trying to differentiate the specs, then the BM spec is the spec that is &quot;one spiritually with it's pet&quot; should have an Artifact Pet as their weapon, much like a Exotic pet, but just as an idea to have a quest where you Tame the most powerful pet in the game set as the most Epic Artifact weapon for the spec. But a Bow as a weapon item also fits more for the BM spec and I also think the Survival spec should be a dual wield spec, like we had before they made hunters ranged only. Just my ideas ....</div></div><hr />
