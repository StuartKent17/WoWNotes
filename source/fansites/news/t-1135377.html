Balance Druid Concerns<br />
If we add Insect Swarm back, it would not be just to have another dot to manage, but to give players some way to interact with solar or lunar power more. There are other ways to do that too, so it may not ultimately be Insect Swarm. The rotation is close to where we want it, but it needs just a little more to play with. <br />
<br />
At the 5000 foot view, the point of the Eclipse mechanic to begin with was to cast X spells for a time, then switch to Y spells with the Druid having some control over when or why that occurred. We don't think killing critters to get the bar moving or gaming it so that you stayed at one side of the bar forever really delivered on the vision for Eclipse. However, those tactics did give players some control -- a way to game things so that more clever players could extract a bit more performance out of the mechanic. <br />
<br />
We are concerned that we are too far to the other extreme now, where the game UI tells you whether to use your solar buttons or lunar buttons and you really aren't making any strategic decisions. We want to introduce some relatively simple, elegant mechanic to give you more control over how much lunar or solar power you have. Maybe that's Insect Swarm. Maybe it's something else. Try it out over the next few builds, keeping in mind that it may take a bit before we have something we are satisfied with.

Judgements of the Pure Removed<br />
In our most recent tests and instance runs, Holy paladin longevity was much longer than other healers, even without Judgements of the Pure. We need to get Holy to the same level as the other healers. It may be at that point that all healer mana income is too low or that damage in dungeons is too high and well have to adjust accordingly.

<br />
Inquisition Glyph<br />
This glyph isn't supposed to be a no-brainer for DPS. Hopefully none of the glyphs are. <br />
<br />
At the risk of sounding more patronizing than I intend, a common mistake I see some players make is to look at maximum possible theoretical DPS and assume that is the DPS they can achieve. We have the numbers we think every class can achieve under ideal situations (meaning no movement or distractions, etc.). The best players in the world can deliver on these numbers while executing very complex boss fights. That's a little mind boggling for us, but it's true. Very few players are capable of such feats however. <br />
<br />
For the rest of us, our hope is that it works out like this:<br />
<br />
1) Expert player who foregoes the Glyph of Inquisition, executes Inquisition uptime perfectly, and delivers 99% of max possible DPS. <br />
<br />
2) Intermediate player who sometimes struggles with maintaining Inquisition, takes the glyph, and delivers 75% of max possible DPS. <br />
<br />
3) Player who thinks he is more expert than he is, skips the Glyph of Inquisition because that's what all the cool kids do, finds as a result that he struggles with Inquisition uptime, and delivers 60% of Mac possible DPS. <br />
<br />
Don't take my percentage numbers too seriously, but you get the idea. Many classes have similar glyphs. My advice is to measure your DPS (in an actual encounter or PvP) and see whether you benefit or not. The rotations that works for the best players (of any class) may not work for everyone.

Warlock Mana Problems<br />
We think the mana costs for Demonology feel pretty good and of course Destruction's mana works totally differently now. For Affliction, we agree that the mana costs are too high - possibly way too high. As some of the posters above pointed out, there is also a bug with some channeled spells, most notably Malefic Grasp, that charge an extra tick at the end. That isn't helping any. <br />
<br />
We think Life Tap as a way of restoring mana works and has been a warlock staple for a long time. We just think Affliction locks on beta right now are spending too much of their time having to do it.

<br />
I went back to confirm, they haven't assigned a buckle to the belt yet. There is one though, and it would look roughly (I am guessing the size) like this (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/may/dkbelt.jpg). It likely isn't assigned yet because it may not be done, the same thing happened to the hunter PvP set. It was in for one build and then was deleted.</div></div><hr />

Fucking furries. :D<br />

Something that people have yet to understand is that these &quot;Furries&quot; are a modern version of a culture that has been around since the dawn of humanity.<br />

Thing is, I recognized the little blue dragon being wrapped up in worgen tongue. He goes by the name of Hida, and he has a LOT of related fetish pictures with with his &quot;fursona&quot;, as they call it, involved with implied vore or being sat on or being stuffed inside panties. You're free to google it. So no, it's not innocent art. It's fetish art. It doesn't belong someplace where young eyes can see it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, there's little doubt about that. I'm surprised to see that such a piece of artwork made through the filtering system to begin with. The implications of the piece are pretty disgusting and far from tame. I'm pretty sure the dragon whelp qualifies as a minor as well.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't validate your prior post in any way, shape or form. People who don't spend their time looking at their furry friends porn collection, probably don't associate furry-vore-fetish art as &quot;porn&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I find it to be rather grotesque, which is kinda cool. Nice artwork, though not very suitable, as mentioned. <br />
<br /> 
Also, 10 cents say that all the people who're feaking out, isn't reaking about because &quot;OMG FURRIES&quot;, but because they felt something they don't want to face.<br />

Also, man that DK set is so awesome. Makes me want to level my DK for MoP. I'm pretty amazed by pretty much all the new armors for all the classes. I think they've done a real good job, considering how many are/have been working on Diablo3.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't say Hida's pictures are innocent either, but compared to most of the stuff on the Internet (not to mention &quot;real&quot; vore, bloody sittings, etc.), I disagree. In fact, It depends on how potent the fetish is. Most of his pictures are not even that bad if you actually look at them. And even in this case, it's just a worgen trying to eat his character (which is always in that situation it seems). Besides, everyone has a certain fetish for something. It's just human nature to like something that's weird to another person. Nothing new really.</div></div><hr />
