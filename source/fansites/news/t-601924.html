Friday, Hortus made a post on the PTR forums about downtimes in the next weeks, I don't really know how I missed it.  
 
 Because we are currently implementing many fixes for sound issues in 2.2 we will likely be pushing new patches to the PTR late at night several times in the upcoming weeks. 
 
As I'm usually not around that late in the evening I can not always make announcements when it goes down.

There is a rather big problem in this post, Hortus used &quot;upcoming weeks&quot;. Technically it could mean 3 things :<br />
First choice : Hortus is wrong.<br />
Second choice : They will release the 2.2 patch with a few bugs and fix the remaining one with hotfixes/smaller patches. <br />
Third (and most likely) choice : We won't get the patch before a few weeks, and I don't really see how they could release the 2.3 patch with Zul'aman and the 2.4 patch with the Sunwell Plateau before the expansion. Of course it could also mean that the expansion won't be released in January, but a few months later.<br />

<br />
Judging from what was shown so far at Leipzig and Blizzcon, I doubt they are done with it, they seem to only have general mobs, and 2 zones finished (not counting balancing and beta testing)<br />
<br />
If it was up for January, we would've seen a beta test by now =/</div></div><hr />

They seemed to be at the same state with WotLK as they where with TBC.<br />
<br />
I dont see why it shouldn't take them more than 12 months to complete. So summer/fall 2008 seems likely</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well guess what:<br />
<br />
TBC: Jan 16, 2007.<br />
That means that if WOTLK was pushed back to December 31, 2008 they would still meet their &quot;yearly&quot; goal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's typically around 2-4 months for a patch, meaning &quot;at best&quot; in my opinion, 2.2 september 2.3 november 2.4 january and at least four monthes for clearing The Sunwell, so i guess june.<br />
<br />
Should we really expect late 2008 ?</div></div><hr />

@Eternity : Well Blizzard said they would release an expansion each year, but it definitely seems that a year lasts longer than 365 days with them. ^^</div></div><hr />

I copied my Shaman character and when I ran into the invisible wall after riding North as far as I could go, I used FarSight to hop over and over again and went very deep into &quot;forbidden&quot; areas. :)<br />
<br />
Guess what I saw? It was all terrain and plants only. No camps, no mobs, no nothing. On the minimap, there were large red circles blobs with white text that said stuff like, &quot;pirate camp goes here&quot;. So IMHO, there is no way they will have all the zones done in January. Just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.ebgames.com/product.asp?product%5Fid=647156 has that as well. While the date will likely change as they always do it's probably closer to what it'll actually be. Just because blizzard instends to release an expansion every year does not mean it has to be every 365 days. Instead it could mean within every calendar year they plan to release one and one has already been released this year.</div></div><hr />

As others have said, there is no way that the expansion is coming out in the first half to 2008. Blizzard is already hush hush about the timeline, and everything takes longer than they think it will anyway. Just imagine how long 2.3 is going to be on the PTR with ZA and SP testing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
stuff the voice chat function... its going to be crap anyway, serious raiders and most guilds have their own vent/teamspeak servers anyway.<br />
<br />
Roll out content and new items and the actual USEFUL/interesting stuff that people want. The fact that issues with the voice chat function which TBH majority of people will end up muting everyone (remember counterstrike voice chat) have delayed 2.2 and therefore pushing back 2.3 which has the REAL CONTENT people want to see (Zul'man and new heroic badges rewards) is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
new content + gear upgrades + balance fixes &gt; buggy useless voice chat</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Warrax</div><div class="date">2007-09-03, 11:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They really need to release the patch ASAP, I dont care if voice chat isnt ready, just dont release it now, I dont care, but the other change need to be implented on Live really fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2.2 is NOT just the voice chat, it completely redefines their code for graphics, sound, and most of the hardware related things.<br />
<br />
This new system allows them to implement new upgrades for graphics and sound more easily without requiring months of testing, but the new system itself needs decent testing because theres no idea whats going to happen when it goes live.<br />
<br />
You same people bitching about wanting the patch now, are the ones that'll be bitching when you can't play because it broke your game because you were tired of waiting.</div></div><hr />

That's the thing though, Blizzard won't release a buggy patch! Not on purpose anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard will always choose November to release as they did the original game (November 23, 2004), then the planned release of TBC (November '06, pushed back to Jan. 16, '07), and my guess will be November '08 for the WotLK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is based off Blizzards quarterly system they have for finances and junk. But Blizzard has stated many times the ONLY factor that matters with them releasing new content is if they feel the content is ready, they have no problem holding off release of new content to fix stuff up.<br />
<br />
PS. /sigh again no patch....</div></div><hr />

It was already doubtful right from the start (that is, when TBC was released) that the next expansion (which turned out to be WOTLK) would be released in January 2008.</div></div><hr />
