Tonight is another session of raid testing! Things are definitely going fast and you can expect new items and a couple of streams on the front page. <br />
More raid testing!<br />
<br />
There will be two sessions, an EU session starting at 11AM server time (PDT), and a US timed session at 4PM server time (PDT). We'll open the zones on all Beta realms (including KR!) for both sessions.<br />
<br />
The following encounters will be tested:<br />
<br />
Chimaeron in Blackwing Descent<br />
Theralion and Valiona in The Bastion of Twilight<br />
Conclave of Wind in Throne of the Four Winds<br />
<br />
Blackwing Descent is a raid zone with an entrance located along the side of Blackrock Mountain.<br />
The Bastion of Twilight's entrance is located within Twilight Highlands.<br />
The Throne of the Four Winds entrance is in SW Uldum off the coast.<br />
<br />
Since these are the beta realms, this schedule is subject to change at a moment's notice due to bugs and server issues. More raid tests will be occurring over the next few weeks. <br />
<br />
Now that the raid testing has started you can expect regular loot updates, here is a list of the items discovered on test realms during yesterday's testing. Item models aren't really implemented yet, no screenshots for the moment!<br />

AoE Balance<br />
You're conflating two different problems, both related to AoE.<br />
<br />
Problem 1: Mage uses Blizzard every pull. Starts to wonder what that Frostbolt button is for.<br />
<br />
Problem 2: Warrior uses Thunder Clap every pull*. Starts to wonder what that Shield Slam button is for.<br />
<br />
* - Yes, I know you need to TClap for the debuff, at least on dangerous pulls. But the debuff lasts a long time. There is a big difference between generating threat with Shield Slam / Devastate / Revenge and using Thunder Clap for the debuff and just using Thunder Clap to generate threat.<br />
<br />
AoE balance for both dps and tanks (hell, for healers too for that matter) is very delicate. If the numbers are too low, then it's never effective to use them. BC felt like this for much of the duration. If the numbers are too high, then it's always effective to use them, particularly given how easy it is when you don't have to pick out individual targets.<br />
<br />
In both cases, the problems come down to repetition. Most endgame players kill a lot monsters. When every fight feels similar, because you approach it the same way with the same tools, then it's easy for boredom to set in. Ideally, you'd go from say a 5 pull to a 2 pull to a swarm to a single target boss to a 5 pull to a 3 pull to a boss with adds, and so on. But even in that situation, if the pacing is too predictable then you fall back into a pattern and boredom can get in again.

Holy Paladins (I suggest that you read the even longer original post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27292693370/holy-paladins-compilation-of-problems-4-01/))<br />
I feel like we have done this several times and what many paladins are looking for is not an explanation, but buffs. Nevertheless, I'll take you at your word and try and boil down our design intent.<br />
<br />
The Past<br />
<br />
The BC and LK design of the Holy paladin was basically to use one or two spells and get a lot of use out of them. This is sort of like the mage dps design, where there aren't a lot of sources of damage, but there are a lot of other factors (cooldowns, procs etc.) that make how you use those spells more interesting. So rather than the paladin having 5 different heals, they pretty much used Flash of Light or Holy Light (depending a little on what gear stats and encounters looked like at the time) but with other spells to boost those heals, such as Beacon of Light and Divine Favor, and then all the paladin support abilities, like the Hands.<br />
<br />
Paladins (all three specs really) were designed to be a really passive class, with Protection doing a lot of passive threat generation (e.g. Consecrate) and survivability (e.g. Ardent Defender), Ret doing a lot of passive damage (e.g. Seal damage, Vengeance) and Holy doing a lot of passive healing (e.g. Judgement of Light).<br />
<br />
It made paladins play really differently for sure, but it was also kind of boring. Because so much of what the class did was passive, players weren't making a lot of choices. Because they weren't making a lot of choices, there wasn't a huge difference between good and bad paladins except gear. I don't really think any of the specs were as &quot;faceroll&quot; as they often get labeled. However, the deltas between the good and bad player weren't large enough -- great paladins were great and bad paladins were pretty good. Honestly, the group to whom that is the most unfair is the paladin -- you can work and work just for a marginal gain above the guy who just picked up the class.<br />
<br />
We made some pretty radical changes to the paladin class for Cataclysm. There is another resource to master. There are opportunities to do the wrong thing. A great paladin will have earned his or her greatness.<br />
<br />
The Holy paladin niche, especially in Lich King, was to be the single target healer. In a raid, this almost always meant the tank healer. We designed boss damage to tanks specifically around what Holy paladins could heal. It was okay for paladin healing to be overpowered, because they really weren't competing with anyone for tank healing privileges and we could just make the bosses hit harder. The paladin tree wasn't very sexy though. It came with a lot of passive, boring or downright useless talents. Paladins were at the forefront of our mind when we decided to change talent trees.<br />
<br />
Being in the same role all the time also gets boring. Imagine only one melee class (say rogues) had a reliable interrupt, so rogues were always given interrupt duty. Imagine mages had the only form of crowd control -- every encounter that's what the mage would be doing. When the Holy paladin can only heal the tank, then every encounter starts to feel similar to the poor paladin healer. They never have a chance to offer to stick with the second group or to raid heal or to watch the melee. With our attempt to make 10-player raids feel more legit, we wanted to handle the possibility that you might end up with two paladin healers (or perhaps a Disc priest and a paladin healer). We'd prefer you to run with a diverse raid comp, but we understand that isn't always possible.<br />
<br />
There are Holy paladins who are used to being overpowered, because frankly that's the way things were for a long time (again, metered by the fact that your niche was very narrow). For them, anything is going to feel like a nerf. Likewise, there were players who were attracted to the class because it was very simple. We heard for years from the paladins who wanted something more to do, so it doesn't surprise us that now that we're delivering on that, some of the paladins who were fine with the status quo are now voicing their displeasure. Overall, we're very happy with the new design. We think it's fun to heal as a paladin. The numbers might not be quite right yet, but that's the kind of thing we're still tweaking. Perhaps two years from now there will be a lot more going in with Holy Power, but we think we have a good framework from which to iterate.<br />
<br />
The Future<br />
<br />
We think Holy paladins are good at 85. Holy Radiance is a powerful AE heal. Light of Dawn is too, though it's more situational. It really shines in larger raids. (Maybe we should have switched which was the talent and which was the core ability, but we knew Light of Dawn could have a more dramatic graphic effect since it was instant, which we wanted to reserve for the healer.) Paladins have more choices now about how to heal single targets -- they have a similar arsenal as the other healers when choosing between efficiency, speed or throughput. They can choose to avoid healing the Beaconed target or go ahead and heal the Beaconed target, with different results for each. They still have a little bit of self healing with talents light Enlightened Judgements and Protector of the Innocent to try to keep that feel of them healing two targets at once, as well as being sturdy healers, as fits someone wearing plate and carrying a shield. Mana efficiency is something to keep an eye on, but we have a lot of knobs to turn with things like Seal of Insight and Beacon of Light. We recently made a change to make Judging Seal of Insight provide more mana to the paladin. Paladins can heal fine in 5-player dungeons and are doing great in raids so far, though we're about to get a whole lot more data on that.<br />
<br />
The Present<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, many of these strengths don't show up at 80. Missing Holy Radiance is huge. Mana isn't much of a problem on live today partially because health pools are still much smaller. There isn't much of a choice about whether to use Holy Light because the comparatively low expense of Flash of Light, coupled with the risk that someone may die at any second makes the decision about which heal to use not too challenging. We haven't seen too much evidence yet that paladins are much poorer tank healers than other classes, though I understand many of you feel that to be the case. (It also doens't help that the popular logging programs and websites aren't showing Holy mastery yet.) If we do decide Holy can't competitively tank heal any longer, then we will buff them. This is tricky though. Too much of a buff and paladins and raid leaders are just going to conclude &quot;Oh, Holy paladin = main tank healer&quot; again. Contrary to what you might suspect, our blue posts reach a very small fraction of even the raiding community. :( Mana may be a bigger problem at 80 just because we tended in the past to avoid putting regen stats on healing plate, and many paladins are sticking with the old models of stacking spellpower or haste, even when faced with mana problems.<br />
<br />
Also contrary to how you might feel, we think we did pretty well with healer balance in Lich King. All 5 healing specs were represented. We think we can erode their niches a little, such that the two druid raid can heal fine, or such that you can put a Holy priest on the tank and a paladin on the raid, without having the healer that nobody will want. We haven't been in a situation where a healer gets sat for a long time. I don't think it will be that way in Cataclysm either.<br />
<br />
As a footnote, it's always hard to talk about the &quot;average healer,&quot; let alone the &quot;average WoW player.&quot; There were paladins struggling for mana before this most recent patch and those who balanced their Flash of Light and Holy Light use. There were probably some who healed the raid and doing an awesome job. We have to look at lots of different players and often talk about you in more general terms than you actually possess. Just because any of the above doesn't apply to you personally doesn't make it an invalid conclusion. Just keep that in mind.

well it looks like the new heroic are going to be much longer than wotlk heroics. so many people bitched that they were joke and they were short, but i liked the shorter runs, just for the reason i could run many in a day, however with cata people want 3 hour long dungeons, making it so only the hardcore/people spend alll their time playing wow would be getting stuff done. <br />
<br />
and i dont like Blizz forcing us to play a certain way. I understand that they want to bring back the need to CC pulls i get it, but they dont have to nerf aoe to do it, and nerf the threat on tclap either, just make the pulls/mobs harder. They could make CC necessary with dungeon/mob design, not with making our attacks so weak is not worth using, thats just fucking stupid.</div></div><hr />

That is why I said somewhere between TBC and WotLK. I like the shorter runs, but would prefer if those shorter runs were more challenging and involved some strategy. Granted, if they involved any amount of strategy and difficulty then bad pugs will turn them into a multi-hour wipefests, but ideally if you got a group of players that were somewhat competent then they could be completed in a reasonable time. In the end I think Blizzard will tune the Cataclysm dungeons closer to WotLK than TBC, though. It might take a few patches after launch, but Blizzard has been pretty proactive with the nerf hammer lately.</div></div><hr />

Making tier gear so easy to get and allow people to upgrade to previous tier after each patch was the cause of this. <br />

They were clearly hard when we started doing them, I remember wiping for hours on the Nexus boss in heroic mode while in my blue/green gear.<br />

Unless Blzzard do like they did with ICC, some fight mecanism will kill you if you don't do that like dispelling necrotic plague or not moving from a missile on Mimiron, we will always end up outgearing everything.</div></div><hr />

Excellent point and one that Blizzard/GC clearly don't understand. They're using the community as beta testers, which isn't such a bad thing. Except for the fact that people don't PAY to play a BETA game. However it is American tradition to take advantage of suckers so I can't really say I'm shocked.</div></div><hr />

Unless Blzzard do like they did with ICC, some fight mecanism will kill you if you don't do that like dispelling necrotic plague or not moving from a missile on Mimiron, we will always end up outgearing everything.<br />

<br />
Heroics were a joke in Wrath because they killed the progression model of TBC/Vanilla where you accumulated gear to run the Heroics. The only people Wrath heroics were hard for were those who jumped into them, severely under-geared, the moment they dinged 80 in quest blues and greens and then they were only &quot;hard&quot; for a week or so. <br />
<br />
A proper progression path will slightly increase the time period that heroics remain challenging in Cata.<br />
<br />
I do agree though that unless Blizzard provides an &quot;optional&quot; scaling buff (ICC debuff in reverse) that they won't stay challenging for very long.</div></div><hr />

I see 4 loot/kill in the 25-man videos, that means only 1 loot for the 10-man version?<br />
<br />
On the beta right now the Raid bosses are dropping 5 pieces of loot in 25 man and 2 pieces on 10 man.<br />
Some of the pieces on 25 man have been the same, but I'm not sure if that is a bug. Also, Argaloth did drop 6 pieces, but that included pvp and pve gear.</div></div><hr />

Heroics were a complete joke from the first day of level 80. The fact that you wiped for &quot;hours&quot; on a boss in Nexus makes me think that you, or the people you were playing with, are quite possibly the worst wow players alive.</div></div><hr />

You need to watch the paragon vid. Its a pally healing. Him and the other pally are 4.5% higher than the next closest healer and miles ahead of the rest. He is doing aoe heal that is hitting for 2-3k a sec. NO class can do that. If anything by the look of that vid pally will continue to br the MOST OP healer in game.</div></div><hr />

Dude. Rets would spam the shiniest buttons as they come off CD.

<br />
Also, I loved this.<br />
<br />
There are paladins who are used to being overpowered, because frankly that's the way things were for a long time (again, metered by the fact that your niche was very narrow). For them, anything is going to feel like a nerf.<br />

I read the post fully. He didn't really address any of the guy's main concerns. From the sounds of it, Ghostcrawler basically said &quot;Paladins have been overpowered for years because they could only heal one target no matter what. Now that they have very situational AE heals, we find it fine to drop a nuke on their main target healing.&quot;<br />
<br />
I also really got a kick out of the last part of the OP's post:<br />

<br />
Let me finish this by quoting Ghostcrawler.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was running Halls of Lightning with a paladin healer at the time, and he had no trouble keeping us alive and even emailed me that he couldn't understand why so many paladins were having trouble with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've run Heroic Halls of Lightning as ret with 4 other melee dps and managed to keep everyone alive with an occasional Flash of Light. Does that mean that I can go in and raid heal as ret? <br />
<br />
Did Ghostcrawler seriously say that his main reason for thinking Holy Paladins are fine is that one guy in one old instance said they were?<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, regarding the AE heal that we're getting at 85... Well for one we still have months before we can even START getting to 85 so fix stuff now por favor, and for two I doubt that the strength will last seeing as how everyone always says &quot;It does 2-3k per second, no other class can do that.&quot;<br />

pallys are out healing by over 5-7% using holy radiance which is a 1 min CD and hits everyone in the raid for well over 3k its op</div></div><hr />

Well lets take a druid. They used to be the best raid healer. We have two aoe heals. One is on a 10 sec cd the other 15. WG hits for about 1k and drops to about 750, efflorescence hits for about 700 or less depending on swiftmend. That heal is hitting for 2-3k thats 3x more powerful than the most powerful druid heal. Now druids won't be able to spam WG on cd but that pally was able to spam his so im guessing mana wasn't an issue for him. And look at the healing meters. Both pally were even they blew away everyone else.<br />

OK im going to play your game. So lets compare both spells. Im using the same facts that your using. As you said, Wg heals for 700-1k per sec and has a 10 sec cooldown.Now healing hands heals for 2-3k and has a 30 cooldown. LOL so basically (1k+10ses cd) VS (2-3k vs 30 sec) In terms of HPS, ITS THE SAME since you can cast 3 WG by the time a pally cast 1 healing hands. That also mean that druid will have a slighter edge on fight where you got constant aoe dmg and pally will have an advantage on fight where you have periodic aoe dmg. On the mana issue part, let me tell you that casting healing hands is costly, the pally was oom at the end.<br />
<br />
And while we are at it, let me remind you that WG is a smart heal and got a 30y range, all you gotta do is press the button, and it heals the 5 most injured targets. Thats some very effective (and easy) healing. On the other hand, healing hand got a 20y range and requires good positioning to be effective. Same goes for light of dawn (even more i would say).</div></div><hr />

Did you not play from Vanilla to TBC? They did the same thing, release class changes before an expansion/major update. This way things can get tuned, also keeping in mind that the class changes and really balance in general is not for level 80 but for 85.<br />
<br />
I agree with GC on this one, Paladin healing has gone back to being some what situational, now it was not life or death in vanilla but it was deferentially not the spam fest you have toady. I understand people do not like change but people really should take the change in stride, since you will either adapt or suffer. Blizzard is not going to go back to Wrath healing, the encounters and classes have already been changed and balanced for that play style. While some spells or your way of healing may not work right now, it is better to learn then to complain for two months about some major featuers that will not go away. Paladins have more spells to use, you need to be smart and think about what to use and when, spamming HL/FoL or HS will not due, as that will burn your mana quickly. <br />
<br />
While you may pay to play on the live servers you also pay for the content updates, the patches, the changes and to access the games. If you do not like said changes you can always vote with your wallet, or you can learn to adamant and play differently. I do not know anyone who would really want to go back to either HL/FoS with cleanse, or FoL spam for another expansion and another two-three years.</div></div><hr />

I don't think all that highly of people who use a personal attack to counter someone's differing point of view on a matter.<br />
<br />
Heroics were not &quot;a complete joke&quot; from day one. Perhaps those who were in Sunwell gear didn't have to worry, but we need to remember that that did not constitute a majority number of players. Not even close.<br />
<br />
In my personal experience, I hit 80 while still wearing the majority of my Merciless Gladiator set and loot from Karazhan. I did a few 80 regular dungeons to get some better gear before going into heroics. When I was pugging heroics, I'd usually inspect others' gear because I wanted to see if there'd be any significant issues ahead of time. From what I can recall of those times, most pugs were decently geared for the content we were attempting.<br />
<br />
All that being established, let me tell you that doing lvl 80 heroics was indeed a challenge. The Brann event in HoS was a healing nightmare, kiting Slad'ran was mandatory in GD (and it really sucked if you had no hunter), Mage-Lord Urom's arcane explosion would 1-shot a person most of the time (if standing in the frost didn't kill him/her first), jumping during the Keristrasza fight was required, you had to run out of Loken's lightning nova... You may be the greatest player of all-time, Senaelanna, but in pure statistics you are only a very small number out of the total. That's not how balancing works.</div></div><hr />

You have had the last two years and three months to play at level 80, now if you mean ICC and are trying to kill Arthas then yes I can see your point. However also given that ICC (Mainly the Frostwing Hall) has been open since February and that gives another eight months to complete the content there should be little excuses. Even with a 30% buff if people are still struggling that is player issue not a mechanic and game issue. However is the fight impossible with the new changes? No, does it make it more difficult to manage? Yes. However people have killed Arthas recently even with 4.0 out, so again even with the changes you can complete all of the content. Though you have had plenty of time to do so before.</div></div><hr />

He's saying that we still have two months until Cataclysm and we still want to be able to raid. Right now, Holy Paladins are just warming the bench up. Our HPS/HPM is not even close to any of other healing classes right now. I know guilds that just sat out Holy Paladins because they are a burden to progression, and they obviously know it. There's no more point in bringing a gimped healer to your raid.<br />

He probably just didn't hit 80 until 3.2 when he started off heroics by running with geared groups as DPS or something, and thus doesn't get it. By no means were wrath heroics difficult when compared to TBC heroics, but they were a gear check for people at the start and did cause some wipes as a result of that.</div></div><hr />

who cares about 80. Maybe they should balance 60 and 70 as well. Honestly if you are still banging your head in icc you won't clear it. If icc isn't on farm by now you are never going to clear it.<br />
<br />
Hell i play a druid do you want me to tell you how royally f up my class is. But i don't care. You know why? cause as long as im viable at 85 is all thats important. Nothing you do in icc or anywhere else for the next two months is going to matter.<br />

As you said, Wg heals for 700-1k per sec and has a 10 sec cooldown.Now healing hands heals for 2-3k and has a 30 cooldown. LOL so basically (1k+10ses cd) VS (2-3k vs 30 sec) In terms of HPS, ITS THE SAME since you can cast 3 WG by the time a pally cast 1 healing hands. That also mean that druid will have a slighter edge on fight where you got constant aoe dmg and pally will have an advantage on fight where you have periodic aoe dmg. On the mana issue part, let me tell you that casting healing hands is costly, the pally was oom at the end.<br />
<br />
And while we are at it, let me remind you that WG is a smart heal and got a 30y range, all you gotta do is press the button, and it heals the 5 most injured targets. Thats some very effective (and easy) healing. On the other hand, healing hand got a 20y range and requires good positioning to be effective. Same goes for light of dawn (even more i would say).<br />
<br />
<br />
Um the hps is actually higher for you for two reasons. 1. WG trails off, and 2. It only hits 5 people. You get to hit all 25 people.....let me do the math.....is 5 still greater than 25?</div></div><hr />

However also given that ICC (Mainly the Frostwing Hall) has been open since February and that gives another eight months to complete the content there should be little excuses. Even with a 30% buff if people are still struggling that is player issue not a mechanic and game issue. However is the fight impossible with the new changes? No, does it make it more difficult to manage? Yes. However people have killed Arthas recently even with 4.0 out, so again even with the changes you can complete all of the content. Though you have had plenty of time to do so before.<br />

By no means were wrath heroics difficult when compared to TBC heroics, but they were a gear check for people at the start and did cause some wipes as a result of that.<br />
<br />
Nope, hit 80 about two weeks after wrath released, and heroics were a complete joke. This was in a smatter of Kara gear and some welfare badge gear that was handed out in TBC. I might have had ONE piece of sunwell gear. To put this in perspective, I haven't run a SINGLE(not one) regular mode instance outside of toc5. On any of my toons. That's how much of a joke the game is.<br />

<br />
I don't think all that highly of people who use a personal attack to counter someone's differing point of view on a matter.<br />
<br />
Heroics were not &quot;a complete joke&quot; from day one. Perhaps those who were in Sunwell gear didn't have to worry, but we need to remember that that did not constitute a majority number of players. Not even close.<br />
<br />
In my personal experience, I hit 80 while still wearing the majority of my Merciless Gladiator set and loot from Karazhan. I did a few 80 regular dungeons to get some better gear before going into heroics. When I was pugging heroics, I'd usually inspect others' gear because I wanted to see if there'd be any significant issues ahead of time. From what I can recall of those times, most pugs were decently geared for the content we were attempting.<br />
<br />
All that being established, let me tell you that doing lvl 80 heroics was indeed a challenge. The Brann event in HoS was a healing nightmare, kiting Slad'ran was mandatory in GD (and it really sucked if you had no hunter), Mage-Lord Urom's arcane explosion would 1-shot a person most of the time (if standing in the frost didn't kill him/her first), jumping during the Keristrasza fight was required, you had to run out of Loken's lightning nova... You may be the greatest player of all-time, Senaelanna, but in pure statistics you are only a very small number out of the total. That's not how balancing works.<br />
<br />
All I got out of your post is that in fights where you had to, and I know this is shocking for a heroic, but PAY ATTENTION TO THE MECHANICS OF THE FIGHT, you sometimes wiped because a member of your party was retarded and couldn't LoS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I somewhat agree with you but you tend to generalize a little to much. <br />
<br />
1.Healing hands wont hit 25 people, well not all the time for sure, unless all Cata fight are designed around having the whole raid staying in a 20y radius.But i gotta admit, healing hands have more potential in 25 than in 10 man or heroics. <br />
<br />
2. Again, Wg is a SMART heal while healing hands is not. yeah a pally might heal lets say 20 people (in a 25 raid) but sometimes, 15 of them dont even need a heal. Wg spot the most injured player so in terms of effective (not overhealing) hps, those 2 spells (healing heands vs WG) are pretty powerful and i dont think you can say that one is WAY better than the other (That heal is hitting for 2-3k thats 3x more powerful than the most powerful druid heal..) They are just completely different</div></div><hr />

<br />
anyway regarding one of the previous posts, WOTLK heroics WAS a joke from the start, it was nothing compared to heroic BC dungeons, hell even H Shattered Halls was harder than all WOTLK Heroics, Given Loken was hardest on release cause his lightning nova one shotted people, but it wasn't too have to have the group move together out of it.<br />
<br />
H HoS brann event was a joke, if you found it hard on healing you must've been sleeping behind the keyboard because honestly I remember doing all of this in my ZA/Kara gear with maybe the odd level 75 blue here and there.<br />
<br />
I cleared Naxx10 in level 70 epics and a few blues, given that heroics must've been hella easier. I don't remember any hard heroics, H Gundrak first snake boss, you didn't need to kite him, just dps him and move away when he novas, as for the constrictor snake, you usually had 1 dps assigned to break the healer / other people out, instead of the zergfest it is today due to outgearing content.<br />
<br />
anyway back on my point;<br />
Watching all the raid videos of the bosses in BETA (Yes beta means they're still getting tuned and fixes) Given that this was a release candidate on beta, i must say the tron defence system looks really engaging (reminds me of the iron council to some extent) but they need to tune up the poison, chain lightning and fire aoe (dmg) or atleast put a stacking debuff on raid members to make it hurt.<br />
<br />
the Wyrmbreaker seems like a simple tank and spank, kill the first drake, sit on bosses ass, move on bonestorm/cleave move while dps, profit ? (unless this fight is meant to be a gear check which it seems like or a dps check)</div></div><hr />

Are we supposed to just sit it out, till cata hits, or can we demand a viable game till the expansion hits? I know those changes are good and fun and really a must for the new expansion. But hey, there are not only proplayers out there. There are still some of us, that want to manage having the lk killed. Most guys here will prolly just call peeps as us noobs. Anyway, we want to enjoy the game as well.<br />
<br />
And also as a guy who likes to go pug with the rdf, it's really hard to adjust to those changes made to aoe threat. not that I dont appriciate having mor interesting fights, but those dd's dont. making it harder to tank, while those dd's still keep their aoe goin, isnt the right way to making things more interessting. I love to tank, and I used to during BC, when I first started to tank. Right now, its more like a burden. They are not making it more interessting, they are making it more frustrating with stupi poeple on the group. And thanks to dungoen finder, you cant chose the poeple youre doin dungoens with. <br />
<br />
Whats the whole Idea behind that? making it harder? ok, fine with me. But got those dd's learn it too?<br />
<br />
I've been in a dungoen lately, where everybody just pulled as they wanted to. I was pissed, and even in a boss fight, the pulled when I wasnt even there yet. When I saw that I just sat down next to the boss, and they managed to kill it without even getting anywhere near losing halfe of their live. How am I supposed to teach em, that this is just not ok? hopefully thats different when cata dungoens hit. Right now, its just frustrating, not interesting, not fun, not difficult. <br />
<br />
I think, and I hope they get it, there are other ways to make it all more difficult. With current DPS's mentality its all relaying on tanks and healers.</div></div><hr />

Him and the other pally are 4.5% higher than the next closest healer and miles ahead of the rest. He is doing aoe heal that is hitting for 2-3k a sec. NO class can do that. If anything by the look of that vid pally will continue to br the MOST OP healer in game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it me or paladins are currently far superior healers at 85? Doing twice the amount of healing done by other healers.<br />
<br />
I would be really, really surprised if they didn't nerf Healing Hands to have some DR in it. That's the main reason right now, imo. I can't think of any particular reason they are OP in 5 or 10 mans. <br />
<br />
<br />
But non of that stuff applies to us at 80, I am not playing cata for two more months I am playing LIVE right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Omg, you srsly dont get the point? ppl arnt QQ about the changes... they are QQ about changes nerfing us to be shit by beeing pallys not beeing shit by playing bad. and as you said its tuned for lvl 85 which i dont give a damn about cuz i cant get there anytime sooner than 7 december... and theres nothing to learn if im not 85... all our skills is tuned for cata... <br />
<br />
And please dont fcking speculate on what is / should be if u dont actualy play a hpaly as main... The changes are great but the numbers they are turning out atm isnt... hell i even love blizzard for letting us do some dmg as holy.. i can now do my quests / dungeons faster with shocks / exsorcism... healing numbers on the other hand makes me wanna cry<br />
<br />
Can you please explain what your &quot;number&quot; problem is? I'm looking at WorldofLogs right now, and while it's not quite the Holy Pally wall it was before, Holy Pally is still a pretty dominant healer in ICC, I don't have time to look at every stat for all 5 healer specs right now, but just going by ICC25, they make up:<br />
<br />
8 of the top 10 on Marrowgar, 10/10 on Heroic.<br />
<br />
10 of 10 on LDW, 4/10 on Heroic.<br />
<br />
9/10 on DBS, 10/10 on Heroic.<br />
<br />
9/10 on Festergut, 10/10 on Heroic.<br />
<br />
7/10 on Rotface, 6/10 on Heroic.<br />
<br />
Just from reading now. Also big on BP Heroic, DW Normal, Sindy normal, and a presence on every ICC fight that is not dominated by 1-2 specs. It's clearly not THAT bad, so you're going to have to explain in a little bit more detail on how you are getting ousted by every healer in meters due to some flaw in the class (rather than personal flaws) if you want some more sympathy. Your old tricks aren't going to work quite like before but from what I have seen (and yes, I play Holy Pally too) nothing is broken, and Holy pally isn't anywhere near useless and has no reason to be sat.</div></div><hr />

now its just same thing but add a rend before you tclap and cleave, tab target devastate, revenge and shield slam the ones you have lowest on threat, its making it more fun, you have to watch each targets threat level to see how far up are you.<br />

<br />
There are no 'heal' spell weapons. Show me a single one, and I'd be happy to be wrong, but you guys need to quit labeling these things. I have yet to see a single weapon on a raid table or proposed raid table of 'test' weapon for spellpower that did not have Spirit. This is why Reforging was implemented, to made drops valuable to a broader range of classes.<br />
<br />
If you want to label the trinkets and armor as Heal or Spell DPS, well that's fine I guess, though it still doesn't hold too much water; but it works because we have seen plenty of gear that seems more DPS oriented with no Spirit on it, but again I have to point out that until we see some raid weapons comming out of the shute there from Blizzard all caster weapons are just plain 'caster weapons'.<br />
<br />
Adding these false labels of 'heal' and 'spell dps' just cloudy up the waters and give people one more thing to argue about when they loose the roll to somebody else on a peice of gear they wanted for whatever reason. Again, I must instist though that with Reforging now live even those old lines of DPS or Healer gear are becomming much more blurred; after all it's not truly spell DPS gear unless it has gobbs of hit rating on it, and at the same time it's not truly healer gear unless it has gobs of spirit on it; but even in those cases those lines aren't so clear with the sole exception of hit rating, since Elemental Shamans don't actualy mind having Spirit last I looked at thier talent tables.</div></div><hr />

I haven't raided since 4.01 went live (we're still trying to get past the attendance boss!) but what I've read worries me. I actually quite like the new healing style and have had a ton of fun in 5 mans and pvp trying to figure out exactly what I should be doing, but 5 mans and pvp are not a raid environment and as fun as the new style is, if it doesn't hold up in raid content then Blizzard need to fix it so it does. <br />
<br />
I have faith that by 85 we'll be on a par with other healers, but the fact remains that if something isn't tweaked soon (even if they tweak it back for 85) Paladin healers are going to be permanantly tarred with the 'usless, give the raid spot to a real healer' brush. Not so much a problem for me, small guild, paladin Healer GM, but I'd hate to see my fellow healadins get kicked from raid groups because the class is not competative (afer all there are still 7 weekish until release). <br />
<br />
I also hate the fact that people assume all the Holy Paladins complaining must've relied on Holy Light spam and little else when raiding before 4.01. As it stands I probably have the same amount of spells on the go as pre 4.01 after removing the spells no longer with us (R.I.P. DI - you're scaring the life out of tanks in the twisting nether now *sob*) and adding in the new stuff. The only thing that's dramatically changed is my Power Auras, I have so many procs, cooldowns etc. to track if they all go off at once I may need sunglasses to cope:)</div></div><hr />

Really sad that they ruined the fun of being a holy paladin</div></div><hr />
