No AH in Shattrath<br />
Well, that's something we kinda knew for some time, but Nethaera confirmed again and very clearly that we won't see any AH in Shattrath ... This could be a problem once WotLK is here, without any AH or anything to do in Outlands, it will be hard to bring people back here. (But they've got time to change their mind I guess)<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but we don't have any plans to add an Auction House to Shattrath. We like that people need to interact with others still in Azeroth when visiting the Auction Houses there. We feel that the portals in Shattrath are a great way for people to travel back to Azeroth and that using a hearth stone is a legitimate way to travel back to Outland.<br />
<br />
If you plan out your travels well, they should be going relatively smoothly.<br />

Update : Druid Itemization in 2.3<br />
More Oomkin items in 2.3<br />
<br />
Feral Scaling: Druids may not be scaling as well as warriors and others at the higher end, but this cuts both ways (referencing my point above) at the lower end side of things druids for a while shortly after TBC was released became highly sought after tanks (atleast on my server) because warriors relied much more heavily on gear in order to compete. Now warriors have gear they're getting ahead of druids again.<br />
<br />
Itemisation across the board is due to get some love with the introduction of further content in patch 2.3 and beyond. Balance druids are particularly getting some better attention in Zul'Aman in 2.3.<br />
As a hybrid class though, it is normal that there are times when you are sharing gear with another class.<br />

you dont know, what you are talking about. while it is true, that the enhancement shaman itemization is non-existant, you can use hunter items or rogue leather items and do quite well. if you stack attack power or strength doesnt matter much.<br />
You say Druids have plenty of items for 2 of their trees... take a look at feral itemization... the Tier sets are terribly itemized, there are some random items in lower tier instances, but only 2 (!) feral items in Hyjal + BT. so once you enter the black temple a feral cant tank anymore, because the Tier 6 Set is only a minor upgrade to Tier 5 and a feral cant dps anymore, because there is no upgrade to the Karazhan (!) Terestian-Staff (Pillar of Ferocity.. lol) and the rogue leather with haste rating etc sucks for ferals..<br />
in case you mean, that moonkin is the 2nd spec with plenty of items.. lol!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Like it or not some builds are always going to be under itemised in some instances. This is deliberate and balanced. It is strange that you tell the enhancement shaman to make do with rogue gear while at the same time insisting that feral druids cannot make do with the same gear for DPS even though rogue gear tends to work much better for feral DPS than it does for shaman DPS. As for pillar of ferocity its only serious lack is hit rating, which if you are BT geared you can get lots of from other item slots. Are you seriously loling at the almost 200 attack power upgrade on the pillar of ferocity because you cant get 25 hit rating from other slots?<br />
<br />
The reason there is not a lot of boomkin items etc comes down to two simple things, firstly, druids themselves are a relatively rare class and moonkins in particular are much rarer. Most guilds will for example have no more than one moonkin in a raid and many won't have any at all. Expecting for that spec to be itemised to the same degree as, for example, mages is ridiculous. <br />
<br />
To use your weapon example, there is a feral DPS staff in Mount Hyjal, one in serpentshrine cavern, one in karazhan, (one that drops in both SSC and kara). Pretty much every endgame instance has a feral staff for the approximately 1 feral druid in a standard raid. Contrast this with caster items, BT and Hyjal between them have 1 spell damage sword, 1 dagger, 1 staff. Kara has 1 of each, and between SSC and the eye there is 1 dagger and 1 staff.<br />
<br />
So there are 4 feral staffs for the 1, maybe 2 feral druids in the guild and 8 caster weapons for the 8-10 caster DPS most guilds have which, for most guilds leads to the frustrating situation of having to shard some feral items while your casters are still using weaker gear. There are always going to be specs not very well catered for in particular instances, warrior dps armor was very lacking in the early instances but somewhat redressed in BT and Hyjal. It is what typically happens, as they bring out new instances they attempt to fill the gaps in items left over from the others. You cannot have every class and spec fully itemised in every instance, and this holds doubly true if you are playing a lesser used class or spec.<br />
<br />
You say tier 6 feral armor is a small upgrade, it grants a druid a bigger armor increase and a bigger stamina increase than warrior gets from going tier 5 to tier 6. In many ways badge items are the correct way to itemise for less played specs like moonkin, because the alternative is to have a lot of guilds complaining about all the moonkin items they end up sharding.</div></div><hr />

As many warlocks have stated many times over the years, any attempt to fix fear has to come at the same time as a fairly thorough replacement of Will of the Forsaken or you will have the imbalance of alliance warlocks being free HK for the undead while undead warlocks are roaming free. I have played both human and undead warlock to top level and I will say with no hesitation that Undead warlocks are imba, alliance warlocks are fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets say you contrast druids with rogues. You have feral tank, feral dps, moonkin, resto druid all of which require different itemisation. Then you have rogues which require pretty similar itemisation regardless of spec.<br />
<br />
Just looking at black temple you have 15 leather drops (ignoring tokens).<br />
5 are healing focussed.<br />
2 are spell damage items.<br />
1 is feral tank focussed.<br />
7 are melee dps items, rogue focussed.<br />
<br />
If you look at this you have 8 expressly druid items, 7 specifically focussed on rogues. Somewhere a comprimise needs to be made. You cannot itemise for all 4 druid specs equally with rogues, or you would have to have 7 healing, 7 spell damage, 7 feral tanking, 7 feral dps and 7 rogue dps items, in effect having 4 times as much druid gear as you have rogue gear. Since druid is already a lesser played class than rogue they are already batting above their weight as far as total items for the class. So there are as many druid items as there are rogue items in BT, but in order not to have an abnormally large amount of druid items cluttering the loot tables the decision has to be made that druids will have to fill their itemisation gaps with gear that is primarily focussed on another class, i.e. cloth healing or spell damage gear, rogue focussed leather gear.<br />
<br />
The only real way to resolve this I can see is to just tokenise everything, but that is apparently something blizzard are reluctant to do. I can understand how it is desirable for there to be a full set of gear focussed on whatever spec you play, but the unfortunate reality is that given the current mechanisms of looting that would result in a lot of guilds getting items they dont want or need because every boss has 4 seperate druid items on their loot table.<br />
<br />
It's a lose, lose situation, you either annoy the druids or annoy everyone else and short of just tokenizing all the druid gear I don't see how it can be resolved.</div></div><hr />

Druids use str and agi with a big armor boost. That is the most useful item feral spec can use. When you see a leather item with green colored armor number and 3 stats with no yellow bonuses on it - that is feral item. Count 'em for me pls.<br />
If you want to discuss item distribution between multiple trees try a paladin topic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you find it strange that i say feral druids cant use rogue leather and in the same breath i say that enhancement shamans should do.<br />
simple. attack power has a 10% reduced effectiveness over strength for enhancement shamans. agility is as effective for enhancement shamans as crit rating is (bok and its the same ratio) hit rating, haste rating and armor penetration are very good stats for enhancement shamans too.<br />
you cant tell me an enhancement shaman cares about his armor much.<br />
now for druids... attack power is about 30% less effective then strength, crit rating about 50% less effective then agility. druids dont need hit rating much, druids dont need haste rating. agility is the only stat, that is awesome for a feral druid. but, weird or not, agility is the stat, that is NEVER overpresented on a rogue item. that makes me believe that they intentionally screwed feral druid itemization in Tier 6 instances.</div></div><hr />

Druids are OP, and don't need better itemization. You can't expect to be on par with a rogue for DPS or cc, and you can't expect to be on par with a Mage for DPS or CC, and you can't expect to be on par with a Priest for healing. You can do almost everything, so you shouldn't be as good as the main class at everything, that is just stupid.<br />
<br />
A skilled druid in greens and blues can take down any class period. Really, it might take you 20 minutes, but they can do it. So just because the average Joe, sucks at playing the druid, doesn't mean that the talents and itemization should be buffed until bad players can win against anyone. The same thing happened with rogues and pally's. <br />
<br />
Imo all druid gear should have a little bit of everything on it. You wanna be a jack of all trades, then be a jack of all trades, capable of anything but good at nothing. If you want to tank or DPS, roll a tank, or roll a DPS class. If you wanna heal, roll a healing class.</div></div><hr />

I only agree with the jack of all trades style gear personally, shouldn't be as good as rogues at DPS, tank as well as warriors, heal better than priests, and DPS as good as mages/warlocks just because you steal our gear. =p</div></div><hr />

Druids use str and agi with a big armor boost. That is the most useful item feral spec can use. When you see a leather item with green colored armor number and 3 stats with no yellow bonuses on it - that is feral item. Count 'em for me pls.<br />
If you want to discuss item distribution between multiple trees try a paladin topic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well that my friend is what I call ignorance, the post above was very correct on what he said.<br />
<br />
First off, paladins, druids, and shamans have specs that make them completely different from their other class specs. But to fill the loot table with the stuff each spec wants is rediculous because then all the other classes would get screwed over (apparently you don't care though).<br />
<br />
Theres twice as many rogues as druids, but more druid gear already (yes there is). To say that you class has nothing when they give you tokens for tier gear is rediculous as well, because you turn in a token for your spec.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but rogues have one set of gear (omg i picked a dps class i get dps gear), warlocks mages and shadow priests typically have similar gear (yes mages go more for crit than locks but its similar), while druids want 3 sets of gear, shamans and paladins also want 3 sets of gear.<br />
<br />
Sorry but then on loot tables half the gear would be for 3 classes, screwing over the chances for the other 6 classes.<br />
<br />
Most people who play these classes nowadays know what gear is out there and what type of spec has more options before they pick their class. Before BC all 3 of those classes were healing only, now they have many more opportunities.<br />
<br />
You guys still aren't happy because you want your 1 sub part of a class to have as much as any whole class. Maybe I could see a point if those 3 classes took up 50% of the players, but they dont even take up 33%.</div></div><hr />

I have, and I rolled it to be a healer, knowing that's what is most available to the druid class. (i mean hell, its name has the word heal in it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
1/ Was it really necessary to give it to all priests? couldn't only one race in the hord get it?<br />
<br />
2/ And what about dwarf priest????? I mean they loose what made them valuable!! Lot of people started playing a priest and beside all a dwarf priest beacause of the FW. So does someone know what Blibli think to give them to repayed this lost?</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea, now they can't demand to all be shadow priests and raid on everyboss with fear over others<br />
<br />
and now certain priest types wont have a huge advantage over others in arena</div></div><hr />
