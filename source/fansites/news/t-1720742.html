Mythic Blackrock Foundry Progression<br />
Midwinter killed The Blast Furnace, joining Method and Paragon at 9/10. There are now 32 guilds at 8/10 bosses down. You can keep up with the latest progress on WoWProgress (http://www.wowprogress.com/), our forum thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1707079-Blackrock-Foundry-Mythic-Progression-Thread), and Manaflask (http://manaflask.com/en/articles/4114?ref=mmoc).<br />

Gearing Up for Apexis Changes in Patch 6.1<br />
In Warlords of Draenor, players can use Apexis Crystals to buy new gear, collectable items, and even Followers. With enough Crystals, even those who are having no luck with the RNG goblins can get new and powerful gear to help them take their adventures in Azeroth even further. Currently, the Apexis traders in the Horde town of Warspear and Alliance town of Stormshield offer gear up to item level 655, but in Patch 6.1, you’ll be able to trade up to ilvl 670 Ethereal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=ethereal&amp;filter-ilvl-min=670&amp;filter-ilvl-max=670) Waist, Head, Wrist, Legs, Hands, Back, and Finger (ring) items.<br />
<br />
There are already lots of ways to get Apexis Crystals, and with the patch we’re introducing even more in the form of new Missions and purchasable Scouting Missives, which will be available for 200 Garrison Resources each. These Missives can be purchased in your Garrison and will unlock an additional Apexis Crystal daily quest.<br />
<br />
A change to questing is also coming with the patch that makes it so players will no longer be able to work on quests and complete them while in a Raid group (though Apexis Crystals will still drop from enemies). You’ll still be able to use the Group Finder tool to locate five-player groups you can join to complete your Apexis dailies.<br />

<br />
I've noticed that a big majority of passives are completely hidden after 6.0 came out, makes no sense to hide them all<br />
We hide a few passives when the changes they provide aren't relevant to making decisions. Theorycrafters can find them online. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/564971923847647232))<br />

Could you buff 4t17 for rdruids? 25% Mana of a WG is less than a (the subsequent) HT costs (and 2pc is better used on RG)<br />
This is an interesting case where different healers favor different healing styles, &amp; some fit the set bonus, while some don’t. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/564953564057829376))<br />
It's a case of a set bonus being simply bad. 25% of a WG doesn't cover even a single HT, let alone two of them.<br />
Why are you making that comparison? You're not losing the Healing Touches' healing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/565009278394564608))<br />
Because you do not have GCD's for chaincasting HT's during high raiddamage, and during low raiddamage (1/2)<br />
You're saying that it's not worth using on it's own. But that's not the point. It doesn't need to be. It can still be... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/565336467686567936))<br />
...valuable for the free mana savings when you do 2x HT anyway, which some healing styles do use. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/565336771496792065))<br />
Isn't the whole problem &quot;2x HT anyway&quot;. When would you ever do that? 2pc also allows for NS on 2 additional Regrowth<br />
That seems like the crux of your complaint. You don't use 2x HT. Others do. That's OK. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/565350370755764225))<br />

Hey guys, any chance in 6.1 hunter guns can sound more &quot;gun&quot; rather than &quot;pulling the trigger on empty ammo&quot; clicking sound <br />
We changed gun sounds in 6.0 based on player feedback during Mists. Feedback about them now, though, is noted and appreciated! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/565230319532802050))<br />

in 6.1 may we please have a golden border to frostbolt (in combat) when fast cast frostbolt is avail? Important for DF timing.<br />
We’d consider that, but it may also be annoying having a constant glowing Frostbolt button while not actively fighting. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/564972537696645121))<br />

Are you worried about frost mage scaling? Arcane/Fire are on par/passing frost already. Frostbolt is still meh.<br />

While I don't agree with this, I 100% prefer to do in a 5 man group, I really strongly dislike the raid group zerg mentality, and being on the same server as a raid group means you can't do it in a 5 man group as the raid is zerging the entire zone.<br />

I do think that Apexis gear is the biggest fail in WoW history.<br />

I would love to know how many toons actually have any 655 gear, and how many will be going for 670 gear. <br />
<br />
I was doing some math, if I dinged an Alt tomorrow and wanted to get ONE bit of 670 apexis gear it would take approx 70 800 apexis missions, this would cost 14,000 Garrison Resource to get the tokens or if you did say 1 bonus a day it would take 35 days to get ONE big of gear, its insane, just don't get it at all, I don't get who this gear is aimed at.</div></div><hr />

While I agree with you on the mentality, I did notice that some of the dailies are much harder to complete in small groups/on your own than others. I am curious to see how this is going to affect that. It doesn't sound like a change I am going to like, but I will wait and see.</div></div><hr />

It's almost as if Blizzard no longer consider wow to be an mmo, as they are removing one of the few open world massively multiplayer pieces of content.

I was doing some math, if I dinged an Alt tomorrow and wanted to get ONE bit of 670 apexis gear it would take approx 70 800 apexis missions, this would cost 14,000 Garrison Resource to get the tokens or if you did say 1 bonus a day it would take 35 days to get ONE big of gear, its insane, just don't get it at all, I don't get who this gear is aimed at.<br />
<br />
The apexis gear is intended for folks who do lfr at most. The set looks bad and in most cases has meh stats but a hiGh ilvl. It's basically trying to thread the needle between leets crying that casuals get raid gear without raiding and casuals crying that they can't get good great without raiding. The &quot;balance&quot; is the obscene time cost. I agree with you that the time cost is too expensive, especially since the activities that acquire apexis are so mindless (with or without a raid group).<br />
<br />
I'm sad that they're removing completion of the daily from raid groups, though. was the first outdoor MMO content outside of loot pinatas in ages.</div></div><hr />

But who am i kidding? its blizzard ofc not,they gonna do the same mistake over and over and over again.<br />

They gonna have to add a buff hotfix every godamn raid tier/content patch.<br />

If they thought doing the dailies in a raid was too easy they should just have buffed all the mobs to make the difficulty more appropriate for a raid group.<br />
<br />
The problem with the raid group ones, is keeping track of where everyone is, main pain was the pit you would have half the group on one side killing stuff and the other half on the other side trying to find where the other half went too.. Same with the Shattrath one as well can get difficult to keep track of everyone and even in a small group in Shatt you can get split up, this is my understanding of maybe why they chose this route wit the apexis group daily..<br />

Could you buff 4t17 for rdruids? 25% Mana of a WG is less than a (the subsequent) HT costs (and 2pc is better used on RG)<br />
This is an interesting case where different healers favor different healing styles, &amp; some fit the set bonus, while some don’t. (WarcraftDevs)<br />
<br />
It's a case of a set bonus being simply bad. 25% of a WG doesn't cover even a single HT, let alone two of them.<br />
Why are you making that comparison? You're not losing the Healing Touches' healing. (Celestalon)<br />
<br />
Because you do not have GCD's for chaincasting HT's during high raiddamage, and during low raiddamage (1/2)<br />
You're saying that it's not worth using on it's own. But that's not the point. It doesn't need to be. It can still be... (Celestalon)<br />
...valuable for the free mana savings when you do 2x HT anyway, which some healing styles do use. (Celestalon)<br />
<br />
Isn't the whole problem &quot;2x HT anyway&quot;. When would you ever do that? 2pc also allows for NS on 2 additional Regrowth<br />
That seems like the crux of your complaint. You don't use 2x HT. Others do. That's OK. (Celestalon)&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i remember this &quot;discussion&quot;, Celestalon ignored all the math behind this tier bonus being total crap (posted somewhere on druid forums here), 0 clue about resto druids, so sad<br />
They forgot that we have ONLY 10sec to use Wild Growth (we can also refresh 4th bonus doing another healing touch) or we will lost our 25% mana cost reduction on that spell...</div></div><hr />

The mobs in shattrath could be soloed before you even hit 100, increasing their difficulty would make them fine for 5man. Making them harder would not make it harder for people that do them in a group, since they are so easy now.<br />

It is after all, group quest and is stated as such but in now way does the mobs reflect that</div></div><hr />

They just want to eat more of your time doing the dailies so that you have less free time to realize most of the expansion is very boring. Dailies are busy work so if players find away to do them faster it is fixed.<br />

If you are too daft to see the horseface while the majority does then YOU are the daft one. That would have been a deal breaker for MANY paying customers. But yet again they fail to take the constructive feedback into account and just go off the deep end with adjustments. There is no pleasing everyone but you should, at the very least, try to please a majority. Happy people keep paying. They still haven't adjusted the eyes on the faces. Same eye syndrome INCOMING!!!!! its humane female eyes and eyebrows all over again. Blizzard, the dumb!@#$s that they are, dont seem to understand basic bone structure. NO face is the same as another. No two faces have he same eyes or eyebrows. That is a HUGE part of the face. Eyebrows are not that high on a face. Cartoony? Yes, we all see the incredibles influences these days don't we, new IP trash.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall the models are a superb improvement and were in need of it. But they seem to drop the ball with FEMALE faces most of the time. Sorry male BE. You guys get permaduck face as well. And the Ginormous hand syndrome. I feel for you guys. : (<br />

I do think that Apexis gear is the biggest fail in WoW history.<br />

I was doing some math, if I dinged an Alt tomorrow and wanted to get ONE bit of 670 apexis gear it would take approx 70 800 apexis missions, this would cost 14,000 Garrison Resource to get the tokens or if you did say 1 bonus a day it would take 35 days to get ONE big of gear, its insane, just don't get it at all, I don't get who this gear is aimed at.<br />
<br />

<br />
Content is not defined by being gameplay-related in the same way quests and raids are, it is simply something contained in something like a box (or a patch, in this case).

You don't have to like that content - I sure as hell don't, more than half of a so-called &quot;major&quot; patch is useless to me - but it's still content, by the very definition of content that you have asked people look up.<br />
<br />
Content is not defined by being gameplay-related in the same way quests and raids are, it is simply something contained in something like a box (or a patch, in this case). Someone will use those models, that Twitter integration and the selfie feature and to all those who do it is &quot;content&quot;. You do not get to choose the definition of the word just because you don't agree with it.<br />
<br />
The selfie cam can be classified as &quot;content&quot;, but updated models and twitter integration are far from content, since content for a game (and a online game!) means gameplay stuff, game related things you can do/play. You can't do anything with new models, they're just upgrades that doesn't do anything for the gameplay. Same for twitter since it's something external from the game. Saying that the content from twitter (wich is the one generating &quot;content&quot; in this case) is WoW's content... just no.<br />

&quot;So why doesn't Arcane Torrent give Shadow Priests a Shadow Orb? It works for all the non-cloth.<br />
No change to announce currently, but we’ll discuss it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since when Arcane Torrent gives that kind of resource to &quot;non-cloth&quot; classes? If I'm not mistaken, as a dpser, you only get a small amount of focus, energy, runic power, mana or rage. A ret pally can get 1 holy power (and no mana), not sure if rogues/ferals get 1 combo point, but DKs won't get 1 death rune and probably Warriors will not get an enrage effect... how is it giving that for &quot;non-cloth&quot; and why it would be ok to give 1 shadow orb??????????????</div></div><hr />

I just wish it was account-wide... or is it? Seems like a big hassle to collect them on every single alt. <br />

Also thank you green Jesus for finally fixing my run animation, seven months later.</div></div><hr />
