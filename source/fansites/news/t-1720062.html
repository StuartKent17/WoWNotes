Iron Docks Quest Hub Delayed<br />
Bashiok confirmed that we won't see the Iron Docks quest hub in Patch 6.1. Keep in mind that it was never actually announced for Patch 6.1, a sign of it just happened to show up in a PTR build.<br />
<br />

Lunar Festival<br />
This year adds a few new items and modifies some older items. Be sure to check out the full guide on Icy Veins (http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/lunar-festival-2015).<br />
<br />
The Armor Casings for heirloom upgrades aren't in just yet, but they should go in with Patch 6.1 next week, so be sure to start saving up Lunar Coins.<br />

With 25m, we took 1000 hits from archers. With 27m, we took 1500 hits. # of archers didn't change.<br />
Sounds like potential math fail on our end; thanks, will investigate. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/564842278473060352))<br />

Hello! We are having alot of problems with receiving 0 tokens from Blackhand kills. Ingame GM's say its RNG loot, what can we do?<br />
(1) Blackhand currently offers a chance at universal set tokens-not a guarantee-with more chances as raid size increases. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/564847015499030528))<br />
(2) We’re discussing changing this, but not until next raid timer to avoid any advantage for kills later in the week. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/564847146235473921))<br />

Darkmoon Faire Race<br />
with the shore strider if you mess up once it is impossible to get it done in 11 tolls &amp; chances is it will come from the spring.<br />
The races get progressively more advanced as time goes on. In months 2-4, you'll get more powers and more powerups. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/564942410380087296))<br />

Reputation / Questing<br />
some reps in WoD can't be increased from 0/1000 exalted to 999/1000. It's a minor thing but will we see it changed?<br />
Appreciate the report! This bug is fixed in Patch 6.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/564894277549838336))<br />

Will Grand Master Draftsman achievement become account wide for 6.1?<br />
No plans to make that account-wide at this time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/564858345811505153))<br />

Hi! The Transmog-Ethereals in my Storehouse keeps moving around, interrupting my transmog-sessions. Could you make them stop?<br />
They will be stationary in Patch 6.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/564858723219165184))<br />
<br />
Is there a reason my Tailoring Emporium vendors keep living in my salvage yard? Annoying to keep looking for them.<br />
The Salvage Yard won't attract tailors anymore in 6.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/564859379782926336))<br />
<br />
Can we get some consistency with garrison mine carts? Horde respawn every 24 hours, Alliance respawn at 3 am.<br />
This will be addressed in 6.1; mine carts will work the same for both Horde and Alliance once the patch goes live. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/564859773930070016))<br />

If you can't wait for the patch next week you can get your selfie fix with InstaDoom (http://www.doomworld.com/vb/wads-mods/71767-instadoom-screw-nofilter-rc1/), a mod for Doom that adds a selfie stick and filters.<br />

No so long ago a patch this small and so void of content would be a revision patch simply activated on a realm restart. Now they add two or three extra quests to the legendary quest chain, give it a patch number and a name like every important content addition.<br />

Any expectation of a feature/zone/area coming in a certain patch you have to take with a grain of salt. We all could probably name a dozen things off the top of our head that were either extremely delayed or still aren't out. Character models are the one that stands out for me. Those were talked about as likely coming in the 4.x patches, continually delayed and then pushed to 5.x, then delayed for a whole expansion until they finally (partially) arrived in 6.0. <br />
<br />
Looking at the big picture content-wise, wod is starting to look like mop without IoT...so I sure hope they don't plan to get 2+ years out of it like they did with mop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard has been delaying content for all of WoD's development, from removing areas on the map like removing the large islands to making Tanaan the first zone ever announced with the announce of an expansion being held back. The gated the first raids lfr horribly, delayed a first tier raid(firs time ever) and gated it's lfr even worse than the other. And now the 6.1 content that seemed weak to begin with, has it's content pushed back another patch(which will be a reason for Tanaan to be dull).<br />
<br />
This is not sad but ridiculous. I feel like they didn't anticipate the the amount people returning and planned ahead to stretch content out as much possible(less is more) even though they're still making billions of us. :(</div></div><hr />

I don't think a new name/version number (and another $60 for all of us to cough up) is suddenly going to fix Blizzard's recent attitude.<br />
EDIT: <br />
No so long ago a patch this small and so void of content would be a revision patch simply activated on a realm restart. Now they add two or three extra quests to the legendary quest chain, give it a patch number and a name like every important content addition.<br />
Wait, it has a name? I thought it was just 'Patch 6.1: Assorted crap that we didn't get around to finishing in time for launch.' Big of a long name though..</div></div><hr />

What better what to give the illusion of content than delaying 6.2 to 6.3 and giving us another shitty, but slightly better, 6.1 as 6.2? That way when 6.3 comes out we'll have a new raid, they can give us another horrible 6.1 patch and another 14 months wait, failing on their promise of faster content and expansions.</div></div><hr />

WoW is NOT Diablo, with its 100500 levels of difficulty. We need ORIGINAL content, and not just the same stale raid for as I guess next 4 months the least, with +5 (hc)/+10M (myth) hp on bosses and few additional abilities.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, I doubt that. Twitter is completely a UI thing, the people working on that aren't working on quest design or art. From what I gather, pet battle is also done by the UI team in their spare time so same thing.<br />
HOWEVER: If they have nothing really useful to do, those people should rather be assigned to help out the actual content teams in any way possible, even if that just means getting lunch orders and replacing the Monster/Red Bull IVs.</div></div><hr />

I don't think we've ever had a major content patch less than 4 months from release...<br />
WotLK had us running three ridiculously easy raids for 5 months before they dropped Ulduar in 3.1<br />
<br />
People have no sense of perspective. However, it's still a fact that currently WoD isn't keeping players sufficiently busy. Garrisons are self-sufficient and once you've cleared Nagrand after hitting 100 there's nothing rewarding.<br />
<br />
The rewards for factions are completely atrocious, for one. That's what happens when devs listen too much to players. Players don't want to grind, players don't want gear behind dailies, players don't want attunements, players don't want daily quests, players don't want gear treadmills, players don't want to feel that they have to do anything...<br />
<br />

When people asked why legacy raids still hadn't been added into the Dungeon Journal yet (this was near the end of WoD beta IIRC), Blizz's response was <br />
There's lots of things like that we'd love to work on but it all comes down to resources and priorities. People always say 'why not hire more staff?' but then if if we did that we'd still want to be allocating those resource and that time/effort on higher priority features and content.<br />
Yet now we get twitter integration and selfie cams while countless issues continue to go ignored and there's still no real post-launch content in sight... What happened to those priorities?<br />
<br />
Also in response to the people asking 'why keep play/writing if you hate the game so much?' obviously because I (and I assume others) don't hate the game. I love the game, which is exactly why it's so frustrating to see the current team ignore feedback and (seemingly) do as little work as possible while charging as much money as possible. Go back and look at all the .1 patches in the past (hell look at any major content patches in the past), there has never been one that's even half as pathetic as this.<br />
I was joking earlier about the name for this patch but I honestly don't know what they could call it that wouldn't be a joke - although the fact that it's the first major patch since Vanilla/TBC to not have a name is a bit of a joke too...</div></div><hr />

IF you feel that you dont have anything to do in wow atm or like it sounds on you: WOW is crap and everything since TBC sucks. Stop paying and play one of the other 100 MMO or games out there instead of just complaining at everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and dont forget that WOW is dead or will die in MAX 3 months because everyone stops paying now .<br />
<br />
Well, many of us have already quitted, let's see the next round of subs stats, I think there will be a fall, whether if this is big or not remains to be seen.</div></div><hr />

I'm not debating that. I'm saying there's tons more to be done--some of which has been talked about and &quot;planned on&quot; (and even &quot;promised&quot; in some cases) for going on years.<br />

<br />
The issue isn't raid content, right now. The issue is outdoor content.<br />
<br />
Never before have I been satisfied with logging in for raids and then leaving the game to collect dust in-between. There was always something to do.<br />
<br />
Ashran is fun, but the queues are either instant or hours long, which is hardly &quot;fun.&quot; When I decide to do Ashran, it's just people arguing over whether to do the main lane or side areas, and then squabbling over why we didn't get x area when every member of the opposing faction was already there. Ashran COULD be a lot of fun, really, but its annoyances outweigh its fun.<br />
<br />
Nothing else for non-raid content is really incentive-ized well right now. At all.</div></div><hr />

If only 5% of the player base use Twitter it might make more of a point....The wow community tends to complain a fair bit at most times but the devs surely cant have failed to notice the discontent the general player base has at the moment about end game!?</div></div><hr />

Just to echo this, Blizz devs stated a long time ago they expect people to unsubscribe when they get tired of current content and then to come back with new content. People whining and kicking like 3 year olds won't get them anywhere, they're expected to leave and come back by design.</div></div><hr />

Yes they are. Seriously. Something that wasn't announced for 6.1 and won't be in 6.1 and people are up in arms.<br />

Something to worry about, if they are putting out the daily hub in 6.2 doesn't that diminish the chances of a raid in that patch? Considering it's in a different zone.<br />
<br />
No, that's not true at all. Just because something is in PTR doesnt mean it's going to be in the next patch it just means that they need something tested out by us. No where in the article does it imply it was supposed to be in 6.1 other than the fact that it is in PTR. It wasn't announced, so therefore we have nothing to complain about.</div></div><hr />

Yes, he said that it was moved. But he also said that it is a quest chain that leads to the events in 6.2. Why have a one time quest chain that leads directly to events that won't happen in several months? <br />
Better have it in 6.2 and avoid the time gap.<br />

You can't say there wasn't enough time to put in a 6.1 questline, and then turn around and say that said planned content was very little content. Especcially when the PTR had a noticable area cleared out in preparation.<br />

HE IS LYING. And very obviously so.<br />

What is wrong at blizzard? This is one of the smallest patches in the games history, and took a long time to release, and yet they say that it is missing things. 6.1 WAS RUSHED. Such a useless and small patch, had to be rushed.<br />

Actually I don't think the title needs a change considering it's partly based off a previous quote from Bashiok, not the one announcing the push back of the Iron Dock quest/s for the record but the one talking about all the content we had yet to see implemented in the 6.1 PTR including the Iron Docks quest hub.</div></div><hr />

That's the whole point, the legendary has events that lead into the next patch and you have to wait for more story months down the line. He made the mistake of giving too much info, that it was moved. He immediately regretted saying that and is now in damage control. His second statement directly conflicts with his first and I'm amazed that some people are falling for it.<br />
