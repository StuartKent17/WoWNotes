Not sure about SoB nerfs, that place is relatively easy, you just need to handle the packs right before the 3rd boss correctly, blow all CDs and Hero if need be, and it's generally smooth sailing. ML will now be easier than it is, even with current affixes it's not that bad, packs only have at most 2 mobs and 2 spells that can cause trouble.<br />
Welcome changes to SoTS, whatever the key, that place is far too punishing and always feel 2-3 keystone levels above what you are actually running.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sad thing is - nobody will notice - its way to lat - nobody is doin anything but freehold and atal . <br />
<br />
they are repeating their mistake from legion - it doesnt matter how much you nerf stuff in stances - community wont notice because if they have been avoiding those dungeons for past 4 months they will continiue doin this for next 2 years. <br />
<br />
they hsould have taken much more radical appraoch - like remove 40 % of trash from most dungeons and adjust down the timers for this included. <br />
<br />
this would bring people back in <br />
<br />
but its clear at this point that mythic + became wasted resources just like mythic raiding. they should scrap both systems instead trying to tune it and failing year after year</div></div><hr />

Motherload/Boralus were already ones of the easiest dungeons, so the nerfs wont do much. Sethrallis, Shrine, Waycrest and Tol dagor changes are insignificant, most of those mobs were not a problem anyway. <br />
<br />
For Underrot, I guess the intent is to make the first 3 pulls more manageable now that you cant run past them.</div></div><hr />

It's probably because it's Blizzard being retarded, like the pepe debacle. Sure they reserve the right to shitcan you for anything, but damn do they blow it out of proportion<br />

As fun as that speculation is, it has nothing to do with it. The closed the API, it broke a legit addon RPers use, they can't reopen that part of the API so they made this (actually, it's been in the game, unused, since vanilla) as a compromise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your wand can't be transmogged because it has the ability to attack from range. That's the same as asking &quot;Why can't my hunter transmog his gun into a sword?&quot;. It would like absolutely stupid to see a warlock swinging a staff around and ranged attacks flying out of it.<br />
<br />
Sure, the wand is hardly if ever actually used for its ranged attack, but it exists so for gameplay clarity it can't be mogged.</div></div><hr />
