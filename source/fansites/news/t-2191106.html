The groundbreaking sci-fi real-time strategy game remastered in 4K Ultra High Definition, to include all content from the original award-winning game and its renowned expansion, StarCraft: Brood War®.<br />
<br />
​​​​​​​StarCraft: Remastered maintains the gameplay and balance that set the standard for the RTS genre, while updating graphics and audio, and adding matchmaking, ladder, social features, and more!<br />
<br />
IRVINE, California—March 27, 2017—One of the highest rated, most celebrated games of all time has evolved. Blizzard Entertainment today unveiled StarCraft®: Remastered, a reverently crafted modernization of the original award-winning real-time strategy game. StarCraft: Remastered will offer a full graphical overhaul of the original StarCraft and the StarCraft: Brood War® expansion, while preserving the sublime gameplay that captivated millions of gamers around the world and served as the foundation for professional global esports.<br />
<br />
“StarCraft is a pure distillation of Blizzard’s DNA—its story, its balance, and all the little details reflect our long-running commitment to epic entertainment, and it’s been a staple in competitive gaming and esports for almost 20 years,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “With StarCraft: Remastered, we’re modernizing the original game’s visuals, audio, and online support to ensure that players can enjoy StarCraft for another 20 years and beyond.”<br />
<br />
The remastered graphics and audio will bring a modern look and feel to the timeless classic, with widescreen UHD support for up to 4K resolution. Other updates will include new illustrations to enhance storytelling in the StarCraft and StarCraft: Brood War campaign missions; advanced matchmaking; full connectivity to Blizzard’s gaming network for social features and updates; cloud saving for campaign progress, custom maps, replays, and keybinds; support for eight new languages in addition to the original five; and more. While these improvements will bring StarCraft to the modern era, gameplay and balance have been precisely preserved, for an experience that will feel identical to veteran players.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is developing StarCraft: Remastered for release on Windows® and Mac® PCs, with an anticipated release date this summer. Pricing and related information on StarCraft: Remastered will be announced at a later date. Prepare to venture once again onto the planetary battlefields of the war-torn Koprulu Sector; command the forces of the zerg, protoss, and terrans in their struggle for galactic domination; relive the epic saga of Marshal Jim Raynor, Kerrigan, and Praetor Fenix; or just vie for the GG against fellow players in this rejuvenated version of the online competitive RTS that set the bar for an entire genre.<br />

<br />
In preparation for StarCraft: Remastered, Blizzard Entertainment will update StarCraft: Brood War later this week to version 1.18. The update will include bug fixes and improvements, including the ability to rebind keys; observer mode; modern anti-cheat measures; compatibility improvements for Windows 7, 8.1, and 10; and more. Once the update is live, StarCraft Anthology, which includes the original game and the Brood War expansion, will be free to download and play.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mormolyce</div><div class="date">2017-03-26, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So it's basically just a technical update plus they've created HD graphics, but still with the same perspective, basic engine etc?<br />
<br />
And the cinematics are getting upscaled? I know some people might consider it sacrilege but I'd be okay with them creating totally new cinematics. Since half the ones in original SC don't relate to the plot in any way. I think I read that that's because the way Blizzard used to run they had two offices working on a game and the guys doing the cinematics didn't always talk to the guys doing the game (at least I think that's what happened in the case of Diablo 2).<br />
<br />
I don't mind it, they obviously don't want to take any risks making real changes to the game so they're playing it very safe on that front. At least it makes the old game more accessible. I'd be okay with them doing the same thing with Warcraft 1-3 as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have zero faith in Blizzard making a decent game anymore. Could not be less excited for this.<br />
<br />
They... already made it...<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
still looks like crap<br />
<br />
Is that any kind of way to talk about one of the greatest RTS games of all time? Respect your elders, sheesh.<br />
<br />
Those graphics were actually pretty cool at the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or Warcraft 3 remake. I never liked SC due to the Sci-Fi stuff. I'll always pick Medieval Fantasy over it, but hey, this makes me REALLY excited for the possibility of WC3 remake, which I'll gladly throw $50 at.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">endersblade</div><div class="date">2017-03-26, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been wanting a graphical upgrade to the old Blizzard games for quite a while now. I'm really, extremely disappointed that they didn't go the lazier route and just made SC using SC2 as a base, and instead made frankly terrible looking models from scratch, but at least it'll look better than what the current game does. Now all they need to do is upgrade Warcraft and Diablo 1 and 2 and I could die happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so basically one can hope for a wc3 remake from now on. *fingers crossed*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure we're gonna see Warcraft 1&amp;2 and Diablo 1&amp;2 getting updated before Warcraft 3, assuming their plan is to have it all run on modern systems, because WC3 already runs pretty well on modern systems.</div></div><hr />

I don't care a new Starcraft game is coming out or not, never really played them and even if I did being able to play these games on modern systems is far better now than having to download a CD key or mess with things.<br />

<br />
I don't understand. Why would they spend resources on an old, old game, while there's already a new, better version of it? What a waste.<br />
<br />
It's almost like each game is its own experience and people would like to play them without having to jump through hoops to get them to work on their computers. Plus it's small development time and work for what could be a large amount of money.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Philosophical Launderer</div><div class="date">2017-03-26, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard is making the original Starcraft and Brood War games free!<br />
That certainly is an interesting decision. I mean, how much can the HD version really cost, when the base one will be free?<br />
<br />
<br />
Mission interludes and introductions will feature new comic-book style illustrations.<br />
I can't wait to catch a glimpse of those. :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Those graphics were actually pretty cool at the time.<br />
Still are, to be honest. The main issues with SC1 are control-related; pathing, responsiveness, fluidity as well as the unit selection limits are all very dated.<br />
<br />
There is also the matter of Carriers = Instant Win. Carriers had no counter in SC1, causing the game to instantly end as soon as the first Protoss Carrier was constructed. Hopefully, Blizzard will do something about it before the remaster is released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alot of oldschool ppl want it.<br />
<br />
<br />
My 2 cents, early april fools hehe<br />
<br />
That was my initial thought but it is too early. There were rumors already they were working at this rework too.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't understand. Why would they spend resources on an old, old game, while there's already a new, better version of it? What a waste.<br />
<br />
Now imagine how big that game is still in Korea. I would not be surprised if more ppl playing it than SC2.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Personally i really hope it will be just some kind of patch for people that already have that game added to the Battlenet. Sadly we all know Blizzard greed and they will charge probably atleast 40$ for this...</div></div><hr />

So dont buy then? Theres alot of people who prefer SC1 over SC2. And alot of people who never played SC1 and now have a chance in modern resolutions. Why there always must be people like you who complain about everything?</div></div><hr />

Since you joined in 2010, you MUST have seen the endless &quot;Vanilla Server&quot; threads? It seems more than anyone, PEOPLE want old stuff.....<br />

They're going to charge people for what is basically an extremely minor graphical upgrade?<br />

I dunno. There are definitely certain strats in SC1 that require the original style. Not so sure theyd work in the SC2 engine.<br />

If you want a tough SC1 challenge. Solo play, pick terran, map is bridge to bridge combat 98, play vs 5 CPUs and set to free for all. Try to beat THAT!</div></div><hr />

Why with how picky the gaming community is now, most devs take the safe route and remaster their older IP's.. And on that there was talk as to why we have yet to see HL3 and one of the responses from Gabe Newell was that they were hesitant in doing HL3 for fear of what sort of reception it would get..</div></div><hr />

Realistically, the HD remaster will only appeal to two kinds of players; curious millennials who never got to experience the greatness that was the Starcraft 1 campaign, and Korean players (professional or otherwise) who are going to want the latest, most polished version of their national sport.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, your average vintage game costs no more than five or ten bucks. If Blizzard were to set the price of the remaster too high, they would immediately alienate the curious camp, who would fall back on the free version. So, my money is on Starcraft HD costing no more than 20$, if that.</div></div><hr />

I never had to for the Anthology. Set it to run for compatibility mode with Windows 98/ME and done. Has ran fine on 7, 8.1 and 10 for me. Actually on 10 right now I forgot to set up compatibility and it works just fine. As do D2 and WC3.<br />
<br />
Also they had a chance here to use the SC2 engine and make it it's own game instead of linked with the original. Lost opportunity imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BroodWar is still extremely popular especially in S.Korea, where this was actually announced during the We &lt;3 StarCraft event. The SC esports scene is mostly over there, and a lot of them have stuck with BroodWar rather than SC2.<br />
<br />
As for people bitching about them making this remaster:<br />
<br />
This is long overdue, the game is still widely played and it doesn't even properly support modern resolutions. Not only that, but remember that Blizzard has seperate teams for seperate projects, them working on this doesn't take away from other projects...</div></div><hr />

Run out of original ideas for years? They've made brand new titles for the past three years. <br />

2015 - Heroes of the Storm<br />

2014 - Hearthstone <br />
2015 - Heroes of the Storm<br />

<br />
Well to be honest, only Hearthstone is sort of &quot;original&quot;.<br />
HotS is just another MOBA - late to the game<br />
Overwatch is just a TF2 clone.<br />
..and even HS &quot;originality&quot; can be debated<br />
<br />
But this is what they always do - take existing genres and ideas and release a really well playing, polished clones.</div></div><hr />

At least they are updating BW to 1.18 to fix compatibility issues and add modern features like keybinding, and that's really nice.<br />
<br />
As much as i'm tired of Blizzard, i'll just keep an eye on pricing on this one, but it would be cool if they gave it for free to the owner of the original like 2k did with Bioshock remastered. :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MadMax911</div><div class="date">2017-03-26, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And what of those titles is basically an original idea?<br />
<br />
There are at least three card games like hearthstone on the market.<br />
There are at least three better moba on the market. <br />
There has been no team shooters like Overwatch?<br />
<br />
Come on, that's not creativity. They tried to get their foot into successful genres and failed hard with HotS and will very likely fail with Overwatch Esports.<br />
Hearthstone is pretty good, because the market for card games was small and Blizzard can sell stuff just because they have their name on it and it is a mobile game.<br />
<br />
So how is any of this original?<br />
<br />
Eeehm it is new games for Blizzard made better than other games in those genres (in my opinion). If you have an idea for a COMPLETELY new game genre. I'd love to hear about it.</div></div><hr />

They're gritty, they're dark, they're animated well enough, they have built-in lobby support and the randomly generated content is much better than the tile-based system being used in Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
Don't touch balancing, don't touch the lobby, don't touch trading and don't touch itemization. Just give us the same 4KHD textures treatment with modern resolution support while under a constant rust storm / warden advisory on closed b.net and we're good.

<br />
I think the whole gaming industry is in a bad cycle of &quot;good looking games are very expensive, so if you invest in a game, invest in something that made good money in the past&quot; and that's why 50% of all games are sequels and the other are clones of existing games with a different graphical theme. Real creative new ideas are only in visually very unappealing independent projects that suffer from general low quality issues. It's a deadly spiral. But Hollywood movies suffer the same. Everything is drowned in CGI effects. Good told stories without effects are not rewarded anymore.</div></div><hr />

I know, man. Warcraft is way better than StarCraft in my opinion, too. They should make their decision based on you and me! I'm sure no one, especially in Korea, likes StarCraft at all.</div></div><hr />

It's the internet. Bitching and moaning is it's past time. I mean it isn't like anyone is forcing them to buy anything or can direct Blizzard what to do. For SC fans this isn't so bad. I remember playing these games in the 90s and having a blast so odds are I will pick it up just to play though the missions.<br />

I hope they do something similar with Diablo games.</div></div><hr />

It comes down to cost. I'm pretty old for a gamer (born '72) and 8 bit and 16 bit games where developed by groups of 1-10 people in 6 months. Today the teams are over 100 people and cost millions and take more than one year. That's a BIG commitment and big risk. So they play it safe. I don't blame them, it's a systematic problem of the complex modern tech and I also can't offer a good solution. Indy games are one way to tackle the problem. But people also want top graphics and sound, but that's expensive and takes time...</div></div><hr />

Who are you to decide it's a waste of other peoples money? It's their money let them do what they want with it. I won't personally if they are going to allow the older version to play with the newer one since I run it fine on Windows 10.</div></div><hr />

Not quite. Some of the battle.net infrastructure and interface scaling that was developed for the SC1 remaster would likely be transferable to WC1-2. <br />
<br />
Additionally, WC1-2 uses 2d sprites, while WC3 uses 3d models; completely different jobs and expertise, so I would expect them to be released separately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your not that old, I myself am old (born 1968) and I certainly feel like it at times.. lol I think the best times I had with gaming was on my Atari 520ST that I bought in 1986 and summarily modded with 1 meg of ram and a 3 1/2 inch double sided drive and a custom cable for a Commodore 1084S monitor.. <br />
<br />
Anyways I had the heaps of great games back then with some of them being Powermonger, Hunter, Starglider 1 &amp; 2, Midwinter 1 &amp; 2, Carrier Command and really cool game that first came out on the Acorn Archimedes called Zarch before it got ported over to the Atari ST and Amiga 500 where it was called Virus https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjVeZ9c9fLM..<br />
<br />
And I think you are right in that the only place we will see innovative and interesting games will be from lesser know dev studios and indie devs where they are not afraid to try something new and refreshing..<br />
<br />
The trouble with great graphics is that in most cases they hide shocking gameplay, I find some of the better games for me at least tend to have simpler graphics maybe because they remind me of all the great games I had on my Atari ST..<br />
<br />
Anyway we will see what comes in the future..</div></div><hr />

Have you considered that many people are not interested in a remake? They want to play the original. There is a site called GOG.com that makes a fortune selling MS-DOS games so there is certainly a market for them. Just because you don't like old games doesn't mean that no one else does. I would love to have the original Diablo fixed and updated to work well on modern computers and I'd happily buy it again, but I couldn't care less about a Diablo remake using the Diablo 3 engine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there anything Blizzard won't milk for all its worth these days?<br />
I remember the days when these guys actually put effort into making new, original games. <br />
They are just complete rip off merchants these days, like pretty much everyone else I suppose.<br />
<br />
Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm and Overwatch are not new games? Could have fooled me.</div></div><hr />

I'm more interested in the 1080p Cinematics than playing the campaign again<br />
Originally, the cinematics in a Blizzard game were meant to be the reward for completing a major in-game goal - you watched them to relax a little after an act boss or a tense mission. I really have no idea why anyone would want to watch those outside the context of the campaign.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remake Warcraft 1-3 in SC2 engine and I'd buy that.<br />
Keep an eye on Chronicles of Azeroth for Warcraft 1 &amp; 2, and Armies of Azeroth for Warcraft 3.</div></div><hr />

Have you considered that you still can play SC1 just fine on ANY computer ?<br />
<br />
Have you considered that you'll just pay to get a simple uprez so instead of having something that's &quot;old pixel cool&quot; you'll have &quot;hugly high rez sprites&quot; ?<br />
<br />
And do you know what an &quot;opportunity cost&quot; is ? Instead of doing that shit so the korean can keep playing SC1 but &quot;IN HD!!!!&quot; they could have made a proper remake to SC1 so all the young player that never came around SC1 and all the other that have already done the previous version could enjoy it in a modern state ?<br />
<br />
It's like remaking WC1 without changing anything expect the resolution, keeping the antic control system and calling it a day. That's just a fucking wast of time, resource and opportunity when you could make a proper remake that would take into account the retcons and style change that occured since the release of that old ass game.</div></div><hr />

Nope, I would rather have SC1 on the SC2 engine as dlc instead. But heck at least the game is free now and with some mods, it's playable on the latest OS.</div></div><hr />

Starcraft is locked at 4:3 640x480 and it looks terrible on any modern HD+ 16:9/16:10/21:9 screen.</div></div><hr />

Some old games just do not transfer well at all to new systems. I tried to get Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds to run a while back and its even newer than SC1. The screen was incredibly buggy because of the differences in resolution. It was all pixilated and terrible looking with lots of color errors. And moving to the outside edge of a map would crash the game.<br />
<br />
This HD remake is a good thing and I doubt will be very expensive at all. And it ensures that SC1 will be playable for years ahead.</div></div><hr />

It won't be free, the current version (Battle.net Classic edition) will become free once the remastered version is released, the remastered version will be paid-for.</div></div><hr />

That's what they always were. None of their games is completely original - it's practically their signature to take good ideas from other games on the market and mash them together into a polished(YMMV) product of their own. Starcraft took a lot from the Dune games IIRC, Warcraft 3 was a remix of SC mechanics with a bunch of new ideas thrown in, Overwatch takes a metric TON of ideas from Tribes, Global Agenda and Team Fortress 2. The only games I can't think of anything for are Diablo and Diablo 2(And the Lost Vikings of course).</div></div><hr />

Warcraft 4 is known as World of Warcraft vanilla. Warcraft 5 is TBC, 6 is WotLK, 7 is Cata... etc. They have stated repeatedly that the Warcraft story is told in WoW. There will be no new Warcraft RTS until WoW is over.</div></div><hr />

It was not meant to be a new game. they probably only updated the graphics because it would be tiny on modern resolutions</div></div><hr />

I hope people are not dumb and fall for this and waste their money.<br />
<br />
Being a fan of SC1 and it's expansion I don't see this as a waste of time or money as long as they fix a number of bugs when ran on modern hardware as well.<br />
<br />
As for something new what do you suggest? They've already made three games in genres they weren't familiar with so what more do you want them to do? Make a racing or platformer? They've already done those in the past so that wouldn't be &quot;new&quot; either. Maybe a Horror/Survival title? A Sandbox title or RPG maybe?</div></div><hr />

If we embrace it, we might be one step closer to getting vanilla WoW (for those who care:). SC:BW is one of the most underrated games in western gaming. It got overshadow by many other worse similar RTS games that clearly did not have the same diversity or balance. Korea embraced it and it has by far been the most successful E-sport game in history. It created E-sport! Once you put some time into it, you will realize how genius it is, and how balanced and hard to master it is :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grahf Vollmer</div><div class="date">2017-03-31, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why does SC: RM look like a cell phone game?<br />
<br />
The original Starcraft still looks better than the remastered version.<br />
<br />
It's looks like Blizzard completely redone all the sprites from scratch instead of taking the old sprites and adding more detail to them + updating them to HD.<br />
<br />
Plus, SC: RM looks too cartoony. But too realistic (like Starcraft 2) doesn't look good either.<br />
<br />
I liked how the original Starcraft looks half cartoony and half realistic. But SC: RM looks 100% cartoony.<br />
<br />
And why is Blizzard remastering the sound? They're probably going to make the badass sounding Protoss Zealot sound like a wimp. And they're probably going to make the Terran Ghost not sound cool anymore. If anything, all the units' voices are going to get downgraded. I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard made the Terran Siege Tank's 120mm Shock Cannon sound like a BB gun.</div></div><hr />
