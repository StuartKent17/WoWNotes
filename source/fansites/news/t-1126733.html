Pandaren Voices now on Beta<br />
Pandaren Voices are now also partially available on beta. For the moment only a few NPCs will talk to you but it should give you a good idea of where the game is headed for their voices. <br />

Teleporting to Mogu'shan Palace<br />
There's an NPC in Dawnblossom (he's the Mogu who looks horribly out of place) that will teleport you to Mogu'shan Palace even if you are a ghost.

Scarlet Monastery Cathedral bug on Beta<br />
Yep, the collision on the cathedral door is indeed totally broken and you can't get to the last boss. We'll fix this as soon as we can, but it might take a beta update or two for the fix to reach you all. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/222109-sm-cathedral/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4796051154#6))<br />

PvP and bringing the &quot;War&quot; back in World of Warcraft<br />
We're with you on the idea of getting people engaged in PvP again within the world. As I've said previously though, we have to be careful about how we do that. We'll hopefully have more information for you all on what we have planned that will assuage some fears of those who aren't very PvP passionate, while (hopefully) still making PvP compelling for those who do love taking part. (Raises her hand) While we have many players who enjoy PvP, we have a larger contingent that enjoys PvE more. That makes maintaining balance between the concepts a bit more challenging, but we love challenges.<br />
<br />
As far as the story goes, we've talked a bit about that and what's coming is twofold. War is coming to Pandaria, which (while it's had its strife in the past) is largely a peaceful region of Azeroth. That's going to change as the Horde and Alliance start stirring up the dust of the past. Beyond what happens in Pandaria, the Horde and Alliance will be at each others' throats once more. We've mentioned it many times before, but we really do feel that the &quot;war&quot; of Warcraft is going to be featured a bit more prominently in the story. It may not necessarily translate to all out chaos in a direct PvP way, but it will definitely be seen playing out in the storyline itself.<br />
<br />
Again, we'll try to bring you more information specifically about the PvP end of our plans (more detail of what was heard from the press event) and get everyone caught up to speed on what we hope this will mean going forward.

This will probably be what will happen. All class specific mounts will get a requires &lt;class&gt; conditon and faction mounts will probably get a requires &lt;races of that faction&gt; condition. In any cast It's awesome that they are adding this at launch.</div></div><hr />

They're still rare o_O it just means you'll be able to use your prize mounts on all your characters, I don't see why that would be a bad thing. Also I'm pretty sure the class mounts are bugged at the moment.<br />

But they are o.O and a Mage on a Paladin mount is just silly, I have loved everything Blizzard have done, okay a few things I haven't but I can accept them, but seriously if they go ahead with Class specific mounts being shared e.g Druids riding Chargers, this will make the game feel very cheap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah it has to be a bug, don't get into a rut over it.<br />
<br />
On another note:<br />
<br />
You know - about bringing world pvp back - I think as soon people were unable to PvP in PvE gear, and the two no longer became interchangable, world pvp died. It doesn't matter if the Arena existed or not, but as soon as you make specific pvp gear that you can only obtain THROUGH the arena, with a special pvp only stat that you can only get through pvp gear, world pvp would die off.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that the previous pvp system was any better. You shouldn't HAVE to PvE for hours on end in order to successfully PvP either, but there has to be a better way. You still have to put in a large time investment to obtain PvP gear through the Arena and Battlegrounds, so why not scratch the gear you can only get through Arena all together. Allow players to obtain gear from world vendors WITHOUT a required rating. Take out resilience, and focus on stat balancing and tuning to make gear obtained through PvE also viable for PvP. Allow for other ways to obtain PvE weapons through non-raiding that would still require a large time sink, and then institute more world objectives, and make it that by holding these objectives for your side (Horde/Alliance) the cost of equipment purchased through honor is cheaper. You would see far more world PvP this way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This, just like the argument for not being able to transmog legendarys makes no sense. Things don't get less rare as people can now show them off, they already had them they can just use it more freely so I guess if you want to delude yourself into thinking things are super rare and special this might upset you. <br />
<br />
Sure there is more motivation to farm the rare mounts but that doesn't mean you're suddenly going to see everyone with ashes or invincible, there are still drop rates you know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
World PVP died way before resillience back in Vanilla when they added the concept of Dishonorable Kills, this you got when you killed a civillian NPC and lost you a lot of rating for that week to progress in PVP. Killing civs was 100% unavoidable when you raided a city or a town because whenever a civ sees you he spawns a guard. When that guard died, another would spawn. The only way to stop the endless wave of guards was to kill the civ, which gave you a the huge penalty.<br />
<br />
The mentality of this has gotten stuck, and was only reinforced when res and arenas were introduced where you wouldnd be able to do much in pve gear like you say</div></div><hr />

The number of rare mounts you could ever see at one time stays the same though. This doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On WoWinsider, there are reports that once you mount a Violet Proto-Drake above level 80 (and presumably with Artisan riding skill) you automatically learn Master Riding Skill. No word on whether or not this is a bug or intended. I'm kinda hoping for the later, as it would save my alts some cash, but it might also be a bit too overpowered for one achievement to save you 5000 gold before discounts.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are a few other issues I'm concerned about with this change.<br />
<br />
1) Mount prices. If you only ever need to learn a mount once, I expect the price of mounts to increase a fair amount. NPCs I can deal with, but I'm a little worried players might try to charge, say, three times as much for the Vial of the Sands as is current. Personally, I'd be more likely to buy it at the current prices if it were account wide, but not at an inflated price just because 'less people will want it'. <br />
<br />
2) Rare mount drops. While at first glance it seems great that people who want the Time Lost Proto Drake or Rivendare's mount on multiple characters will only need to obtain it once, I can still see some players attempting to 'keep the mount rare' by Needing on the drop, or farming the rare spawn, even though they've already learned the mount. That would suck. Hard. Far as I'm concerned, it's only polite to stop hunting the TLPD once you have the mount, and let someone else have a chance, but I doubt it will be that simple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a couple of ways it'll turn out..<br />
<br />
1) Profession-made (and BoE mount drop) mounts will skyrocket in price, because the sellers think &quot;Since each account only needs one mount instead of each character, less will be sold, thus I should make it more expensive&quot;.<br />
<br />
2) The mounts remain at the same price, because sellers think &quot;Since mounts are account-wide, more people are likely to buy the mount at this price because it benefits all of their characters&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping the latter. I'm more likely to buy the Vial at 40k-45k gold when mounts are account wide, than at that price right now, or at triple that price later.</div></div><hr />

Judging by the way mailing the Level 25 Guild mount from a Horde character to an Alliance character causes it to turn into the Lion, I'd expect faction specific mounts will change into their appropriate versions for the character using them. Either that, or just be locked out. Still in the spellbook, but unusable.</div></div><hr />

You know the mount part will never happen. Blizzard has already stated that they are done making class specific mounts. Your idea takes racial mounts into the realm of ridiculous, Warlocks and Paladins don't even have faction specific mounts let alone class racial mounts. If it takes too long to implement a simple class mount, where in the world are they going to come up with the time time for nearly 100 class racial mounts? So you would rather them make class racial mounts over the course of the next two or three expansions then get any new mounts, because that's exactly what you're implying. They add about 30-40 mounts each expansion. I agree that Blizzard is cutting corners a lot lately, but not implementing ridiculously more time consuming tasks that most people will just glance over in favor of the raiding/rare mounts is one of the smarter decisions.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think the profession mounts will require you to have the profession, since if you level tailoring up get the mounts learn it, then drop it you can still use them.<br />
<br />
Have they changed that recently, because it didn't work that way before? It stayed in your spell book, but you couldn't use it.</div></div><hr />

I don't think the profession mounts will require you to have the profession, since if you level tailoring up get the mounts learn it, then drop it you can still use them.<br />
<br />
I can confirm as someone who had leveled Tailoring to grab 3 flying carpets, then dropped Tailoring to level up JC, that it does not work like that in-game. <br />
<br />
As in the retail servers, right now. <br />
<br />
You need to have tailoring to use the tailoring mounts.<br />
<br />
And as stated in the news post, it's painfully obvious that the Mage being on the Paladin mount is a bug, and that Mages will not have access to Paladin (or Warlock or Death Knight) mounts from your other characters. It makes sense that the mounts that require a profession (the Engineering helicopters and tailoring carpets) will continue to retain their profession requirements.</div></div><hr />

You're not obligated to do anything in this game. You're not even obligated to continue paying your subscription.<br />

The profession mounts are probably still worth leveling if you're more interested in the Achievement for mounts owned, as that's how the mount system works currently -- even if you have a profession mount that is from a profession you do not have, it will still continue to count towards the achievement even though you are unable to summon the mount for use.<br />
<br />
The cross-faction mounts will obviously display as their equivalent when on a different-factioned character, so unless you have all the Argent Tournament mounts for your faction, farming more seals may still be in the question.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You worked hard for them, as a &quot;reward&quot; you get it on your other characters is what I view it as. However I can some how bet that the class mounts will not be shared account wide meaning you won't have to level a class. Even though a DK gets their mount on the like 6th or 7th quest in the starter zone.... so &quot;leveling one&quot; is a tad over exaggerated; just go far enough to get the mount then never touch the character again. ;x<br />

^ Now that is an idea I to me! Haha No more worrying about which character I get to take ... I don't know how many times someone would ask me to come on a mount run to tell me I had to bring someone other than my hunter collector because they had &quot;enough&quot; in the raid. Soon as I hit 90 I'm going to farm Ony ~ x3</div></div><hr />

<br />
The cross-faction mounts will obviously display as their equivalent when on a different-factioned character, so unless you have all the Argent Tournament mounts for your faction, farming more seals may still be in the question.<br />
I've got all the profession ones, all the Horde ones, all the Horde Tournament ones, so I'm set there.<br />
<br />
Heard the mount achievements have been completely removed in beta, though? Maybe this was why.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Faction mounts convert, a raptor on Horde is a ram on Alliance. You WON'T use Horde specific mounts on Alliance and vice versa. They'll convert just as when you faction change.<br />
<br />
Class mounts will most likely NOT be made account wide, this is just a test. You will get to keep being special snowflakez, but I do hope that they either make your mounts not count for achievements/mount count, OR that they count for the entire account but no other characters can use them.<br />
<br />
This feature means that you can basically level a class that's known to solo very well, and start farming. Got 10 alts? Well if they can handle it, you can basically farm the same rare mount 10 times per week instead of once. You can make groups and farm those a bit harder to get mounts on alts and whatnot. and you can FINALLY switch mains freely only depending on gear, not that you lack mounts and pets and achievements that you've been working so hard for.<br />
<br />
I can't wait to have a level 70 twink using a Swift Spectral tiger, or Fiery Warhorse. Some mounts are even level 20 now so gonna make for some seriously epic stuff here. And finally I'll have use for my DK beyond professions.<br />

<br />
Class and profession specific mounts do transfer at the moment. BoA mounts do work cross faction, BUT it only transfers mounts which can be used by both alliance and horde. Faction specific mounts do not get transfered (my alliance chars had 132 mounts, the horde one only 65).<br />
<br />
It does work cross realm as well, although I only tried with the horde char. So I can't confirm 100% for sure that all mounts get transfered when it's the same faction but on another server, I'd assume they do get transfered propperly though.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind these kind of things can still easily change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1- Mounts exclusive for certain classes can only be used by those classes.<br />
2- Mounts that require a certain profession will continue to require that profession at its correct level<br />
3- Alliance and horde mounts are and will always be faction bound. So you won't see a Tauren a gnome mount.<br />
4- You need to be at the correct level in which you can gain that mount.<br />
5- you still need to train your riding skills per character in order to qualify for riding a mount according to your level.</div></div><hr />

Anyone blerting out with that arguement clearly needs their heads checked. Can't login to several characters on the same account at the same time. Some people's logic fails.<br />
<br />
I don't agree. Right now you can do heroic dungeons and raids (where the most rare drops come from only once a day(dungeons) or week (raids)<br />
if you have multiple characters, you can multiply that chance with the number of character you have at the appropriate level if you really want the mount badly. <br />
more chances to get it in a lockout = faster drop overall = more mounts overall<br />
<br />
Edit: it didn't make sense that paladins were in a quite advantaged position with access to 3 or 4 extra mounts compared to other classes. <br />
(and before you start whining &quot;well level one then&quot;, ask yourself the question why paladins should have those class specific mounts, and other classes cannot have such things...)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok class specific will not be account wide and this is just a bug. If you remember class mounts are being learned via trainers. This is how people knew mounts will be account wide last month.<br />
<br />
But I do hope all classes get their own 2 mounts like lock/paladins. Like a human rouge will get a horse mount but with a rouge feel. Or a rouge Orc will get a wolf mount with a rouge feel. I am all for race specific class mounts. Then again knowing Blizzard and how lazy they are I dont think we will see that. Better chance of seeing Monk/DK tier sets (pve/pvp) all the way to Cata made before my idea.<br />

TBH the feature isn't completed and I doubt they'll allow class mounts to be used by all your characters. Obviously there will be restrictions as Blizz has stated not all mounts will be available with this feature, from player speculation (that was supposedly construed from a blizz post but don't quote me) the feature will only use achievement mounts.<br />

All my mounts were deleted (can't summon then with command line either) went and got myself a wind rider for the time being.<br />
<br />
I'm 100% sure class mounts will stay restricted and feel pretty confident profession mounts will as well</div></div><hr />

But if they're all free for all - awesome, will just gather paladin look-alike armor pieces on my DK and will annoy the hell out of those paladins :D Cba if they use DKs mount, Blizz already raped it with Shadowmourne reward mount.</div></div><hr />

BUT&lt; to be honest, I think class mounts should stay class-restricted (same with profession mounts). What I am curious about is if they are literally Account-Wide or only Server-Wide... but, either way, I don't care. Still totally stoked about this even being implanted, let alone being seriously considered! :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not against this, it's like having the Tailoring mounts, but not being a tailor anymore. You have it but you just can't use it, although it does count towards the total. For me, this will be incentive to start a Blood Elf Paladin and work on horde faction rep, with the exception where they overlap with the same mounts - like the Talbuk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2012-05-04, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently, cross faction mounts are not in and likely will remain that way. Rather a disappointment since I find faction restrictions on things like mounts to be silly and archaic, but whatever. If Pandarens can be on both sides, why not mounts? Silhouette is no longer necessary since a lot of people just follow the rule: if it's red, it's dead. But I guess if they let us have cross faction mounts, then the mount achievement would be really trivialized. :p Just more reason to add more tiers to the achievement.<br />
<br />
I logged into my draenei shaman who has 103 mounts on live. She had 103 mounts in beta, too. I then logged into my blood elf paladin who had suddenly had 88 mounts. She has around 50 on live. I know my paladin got the swift zhevra added to her collection along with the blue drake and mammoths from Dalaran as well as the Cata camels (among other mounts I forgot), none of which she has on live. I also bounced over to my night elf druid who had over 50 mounts (forgot the amount) on live. Didn't really look to see how many she had in beta. I logged back into my shaman to find 0 mounts. I relogged and she had 108. I had 3 carpets, the level 20 Brewfest Ram (only available the first year of Brewfest), and the fossilized raptor added to her collection. The ram and raptor I only have on my paladin on live. The carpets I only have on my druid on live. My shaman could not access my paladin's charger. So seems you will get mounts from the opposite faction as long as they had no faction restriction.<br />
<br />
As it stands, the mounts are incredibly buggy. Logging in to level your main toon after logging into a few other toons only to find the toon you're on has 0 mounts is a bit irritating, but meh. Joys of beta. But it does appear it'll be in for release or at least very shortly after. :) Best change ever and LONG overdue. Love to see how this will interact with battle.net in the long run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for restrictions, these will come later, remember at the moment pets are lacking restrictions as well. You can summon the Orc Argent Squire on an Alliance character, and the Human one on a Horde character. I'm quite sure eventually they will add restrictions, they will be just like they work on live, you can see a mount on the list, but when you try to summon it, you'll be greeted by an error saying you can't do it without a specific profession or class.</div></div><hr />

Mounts are cosmetic, they don't affect your contribution to any encounter PvE or PvP, farming, grinding, profession or anything else.<br />
Gear, while cosmetic, is a direct improvement on how your character performs it's role, if you cannot see the difference, then by all means, keep whining for made up reasons, although, that's a bit sad.</div></div><hr />

I'll remain as constructive as I can, but I have a Druid sitting on my account that has been there for years for the sole purpose that one day Blizz will do this account wide stuff. It felt like punishment to have to stick with the Druid, cause I didn't want to run all the stuff over again to get the mounts and/or achieves. I hated being bound to one character.<br />

Yes we will see a bit more rare mounts on toons that aren't in top tier purples, but that also means we'll see less of the Bronze Drake Syndrome effect where one mount that looks better than a racial flyer but is still easy to get is everywhere. I'd rather drown in Black Proto Drakes then see any more of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for example: having different toons with the holiday titles and getting the violet protodrake although none of the individual toons have the full meta.<br />
<br />
Yes, been wondering the same - got the meta on two characters so if I moved one character over to another account the characters there should be getting the flight speed besides mount with achievement wide when its up.</div></div><hr />

Why wouldn't it? It's a mount, just like any other.<br />

Anyway I double checked, and you can use the Tundra Traveler's, Sandstone, Chopper.<br />

Also, just checked, my chars are all allies, so I made a horde premade on a different server, while mounts and pets are account bound, the allie specific mounts do not show up on the list on a horde, so that takes care of that question.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, most definitely you wont be able to ride horde mounts as alliance (visa versa) or class specific mounts (warlock pally dk). Only makes sense, secondly you won't be able to ride a very fast mount at level 60 no matter what.. aside from account wide or not.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about locks since I don't have one on beta at the moment but as for the Death Knights Acherus Deathcharger and Winged Steed of The Ebon Blade both can be ridden by your other toons. I just checked and my shaman is able to ride my DK's Acherus Deathcharger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While to some extent I agree that it should stay a paladin only mount same with the warlock one, Blizz all but destroyed how exclusive and awesome it was when you finally got it. That was when Blizz took away the quest chain Paladins and Warlocks had to do to get their mounts. I mean all you have to do now is pay what 20g or something to a trainer now to learn it not at all like it was. Even the Death Knight still has to do some quests to get their Deathcharger, unless they changed that too which would not surprise me at all.<br />
<br />
But really I can't see it as being game breaking..</div></div><hr />

It doesn't break the game and no one is special b/c they have a mount.<br />
<br />
I have earned a crap ton of mounts on my Prot war, I have mounts you cant get anymore, Like the first ZG raptor, the first refer a friend mount and so on, I have done the grind twice for Nether Drakes, Skyguard and wintersaber on 2 different toons and I am so happy I never need to do that again to use those mounts.<br />
<br />
I swear people act like Blizz is going to be selling rare mounts at vendors, these mounts are mounts YOU have earned, so why shouldnt you use them on all your toons?<br />
<br />
As far as the class mounts go, I am pretty sure that will not stay in launch, but man if it does I will be starting a lock alt and a DK alt :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Logged into the beta, it is quite heavily bugged but i made sure get plenty of screenshots of multiple chars on different class mounts.<br />
<br />
Also, as it is now, if you have Violet Proto-Drake on one character it goes to all of your characters and if you ride it on a character without 310 flying they are granted 310 flying skill, and it applies to all flying mounts for them, as it is the skill like i said. ( :) Happy faces !! now i can have 310 flying on all 10 85s, !!)<br />
<br />
Something that i would like to see though, is for the certain achievement/crafted mounts that are faction specific have their counterpart reproduced on the opposite faction so all my chars can use my Mekgineer's Chopper and my Blue Dragonhawk which my mount whore i mean warlock has on him. Currently they don't transition over so i hope that gets addressed by release.<br />
<br />
All in all, super awesome feature that makes me want to farm more mounts and play even more.. !</div></div><hr />

The thought of having Violet Proto-Drake on all my toons, and 310 flying makes me happy! I'm also in a position where the benefits extend far beyond that, as my mage has mounts none of my other toons have (e.g., Raven Lord, Blue Proto-Drake, Blue Drake) and my druid (on a different server) was lucky enough to win the roll for the Black Drake (from an OS-3D PUG). Oh, and Spectral Tigers for all my toons (thanks to my hunter) = WIN!<br />
<br />
<br />
To the Beta, at the moment (well last night anyway):<br />
The code is VERY buggy right now. It seems the available list starts copying with the first toon you login with, and tries to populate itself to each toon afterward. However, the copy to toon #2 doesn't go properly, and when logging in toon #3, only the mounts #2 had and maybe randoms from toon #1 (if that) copy onto toon #3. The &quot;master list&quot; that it should build isn't building properly, guessing the table is too sort to fill in all the entries (reasoning that if someone has 100 or more mounts, possibly they made the table on the Beta at the moment have like 99 slots or less?) The end result is, for example, mounts 100 through 135 (making up numbers here) don't get written to a table that has only 99 slots. It's only guesswork, based solely on my wife's experience and thoughts while seeing it unfold last night when she logged into the Beta - I never logged in, was just sitting there watching the chaos unfold on her screen and hearing her theorize as to wtf was happening.<br />
<br />
As to class only mounts/Faction mounts:<br />
I am pretty sure anyone in Beta being able to use a class specific mount (e.g., Paladin warhorse) when NOT of that class (e.g., Warlock) is totally unintentional and probably a totally different bug within the mess I tried to describe above. The faction specific mount exclusions (e.g., a Black War Raptor can only be used by races = Undead, Tauren, Blood Elf, Orc, Troll, Pandaren_Horde) was most likely flubbed by a typo or left out for the sake of just seeing if the experiment would work. It will almost definitely be fleshed out before launch, given I'd feel awkward seeing a Draenei on a Black War Raptor - as much as an Alliance player would feel awkward seeing my Orc DK mounted on a Mechano-strider.</div></div><hr />

Probably right there with the copying of mounts and this as folks should know is the first we have seen of this system. The copying weirdness being on my shaman I am getting my mages tailoring specific mounts counted as well, even though my shaman can't use them not sure why it should but it is..<br />
<br />
On a lighter side I foresee the prices of the Choppers and Sandstone Drakes going up as you will only need to by one of each. And even better if you have the repair mammoth same thing there too. All of your toons will enjoy the benefits of the mount and not have to pay 14k each time to get one for each of your toons.</div></div><hr />

My wife noted this last night - and I totally forgot to mention it in my original posting. Her hunter is an engineer, and her engineering-only flying mounts were showing up in the list of available mounts for her other toons. Yet, as you stated, those non-engineering toons could not use the engineering-only flying mounts.

Are you telling me you have had more than 60 characters? 10 per server is a fine amount, as it allows one of each class. You call it a silly game, but if at one point you had 60 characters, you obviously didn't think so.</div></div><hr />

I know what you mean by &quot;tanking content out of the game&quot;. I've farmed 2+ of some rare mounts and wouldn't mind farming them again on other characters. Same thing about account wide achievements (got Salty on 3 out of 4 level 85s, considering doing it on last alt too).<br />
<br />
However, being able to use my favorite mounts on all characters in my opinion outweighs downside of account wide mounts. Can't say the same about account wide achievements, I think its a bad idea.</div></div><hr />
