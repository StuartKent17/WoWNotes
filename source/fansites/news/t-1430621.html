Classes<br />
GC said &quot;if don't want to multi DoT, don't play Shadow Priest&quot;. Now I think - is there any ranged class that doesnt multidot?<br />
Some are more multi-DoT heavy than others. Mages in WoD won't multi-DoT at all (Well, technically, Pyro's DoT could be multi-DoTed.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411959846640967681))<br />
Elemental is also fairly light on multi-DoTing. Not zero, but relatively little, compared to Shadow/Balance/Affliction. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411960431872180224))<br />
How about Destruction and Demonology, are they hit with multi dotting options now you only mention Affliction?<br />
Multi-DoTing is a core Warlock attribute; all specs will include it to some extent, Affliction most of all. Basically same as now (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/412297033043566592))<br />
<br />
What is the reasoning behind having Rogues and other classes who dual wield have white attacks still be missable in WoD? 1/2<br />
It keeps DW balanced with 2H. If we were to remove it, we'd have to reduce the damage of 1Hs or 1H attacks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411718347147845632))<br />
If OH white weapon damage was reduced instead of missing, would that solve the &quot;bad feeling&quot; of seeing misses?<br />
OH hits currently hit for 50%. Would you rather they hit for 25%? That's what it'd take. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411949143846694912))<br />
<br />
WoD Vengeance: Why not have abilities just go to the DK's % of damage over the last 5 seconds and do away with the wierd buff?<br />
Mechanically, 5sec vs 20sec is one difference. Also smoothing. You don't think the hidden dmg-taken-last-5sec is weirder? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411181970194837504))<br />
No. I think a stacking AP buff but only for certain spells, which is only caused by some attacks, just feels overcomplicated.<br />
It won't be an AP buff anymore. We also MAY not need the Vengeance on Taunts anymore either, or the bump to 50% of expected. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411334196406149120))<br />
But you're still keeping the +100% threat during Taunt's fixate period right?<br />
200%, but yeah. That's what MAY make it OK to remove those two things. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411403663777603584))<br />
<br />
hello, i wonder if all the healers will have their mana pool locked in WoD like in MoP. pls no.<br />
What is it that you liked about variable mana pools, besides just seeing the number get bigger? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414951087452348416))<br />
Compared to being able to cast 6 fireballs for example instead of 4 before running out of mana.<br />
But that never actually played out in practice, right? Mana pools have never been small enough that they were the limiter. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414956499874500609))<br />
<br />
Have you considered making catch-all icons for tier talents that reflect current choice? Macros for it are unwieldy.<br />
Yes, going to try to make more talent rows work like Mage Bomb in terms of sharing a button. Can't do so in all cases, but most. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414611786713681920))<br />
Great news, thanks!<br />
Sure. It works for things like Priest 90 or Monk 30. Not so well for things like Rogue 90. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414623243966767104))<br />

Deathblow to festerblight was deathblow to my dk. Shame, only melee class I had any interest in.<br />
I wouldn't be so sure of Festerblight's death. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411764487926980608))<br />
Oh come on, no fair teasing me like that!<br />
Don't get your hopes TOO high, I'm just saying that there's a chance that something similar may develop with Necrotic Plague. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411948715696324608))<br />

any chance of druids not losing model change effects from toys when shifting forms? Already works ok in ragefire scenario<br />
Current tech needs major rework for it to happen universally. Those scenarios took tons of ridiculous scripting and spells. T_T (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417351857401368576))<br />
<br />
1st Merry Xmas, 2nd how will dots work for balance druids with the change to snapshot? I'm referring to eclipse as a dmg mofier.<br />
Eclipses' effects will snapshot on Moonfire/Sunfire. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/415955584291049472))<br />
How will the mechanic change to make up for that? One of the few snapshots left. Won't balance DPS be very swingy?<br />
Perhaps a misunderstanding? I'm saying that it'll stay as it is today. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416686742318505984))<br />
So Sunfire and Moonfire will still snapshot haste, crit and eclipse buffs?<br />
No, Eclipse will. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416745461551071233))<br />
<br />
- how do you feel the Glyph of Efflo is working? Are we going to see it kept in place for WoD, or should we expect changes?<br />
We like the concept. It's probably too powerful for something so passive, so we may adjust tuning. That goes for all healers in general though; we want to time down passive healing and smart healing across the board. Most healing should come from actives.

Dear Santa: please give us tameable mantid tanks and pterodactyls in the near future. Wait, Christmas has already passed? Dang..<br />
I was ALWAYS bummed that the OG Un'Goro dinos weren't tamable. I do wish the Tome of Dinomancy opened up more. Hrmmm... (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417351462436347904))<br />
I'm fairly sure many hunters would love it if you looked into it! How about mantid tanks? Any chance for those? /nervousface<br />
I'd say it's unlikely for a few reasons, but who knows! (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417353694288424960))<br />
Addendum: Not that I'm unappreciative of your answer Just curious. Love silithids; would take mantid tanks over anything.<br />
Hunter pets are an odd thing &amp; a source of internal debate. I'll admit to not understanding/agreeing w/ some allowed &amp; unallowed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417358150056960001))<br />
<br />
I'm a hunter player for 5 years now.I know you ain't heading for a revamp though i need to ask will MM/SV/BM feel different?<br />
That is precisely our goal. We don't think that requires a &quot;revamp&quot; or &quot;overhaul&quot;. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414890362209959937))<br />

But saying stuff like &quot;Frost Mages do not scale well with gear because they experience many low % soft-caps.&quot; Is okay, right?<br />
Almost. Softcaps reduce scaling rate, but that says nothing of whether the scaling rate was OP before, or if the difference is significant. In Frost's case, the next secondary is close in value, so its effect is minor, and their scaling prior to that was higher than normal, because we expect most high end Frost mages to hit that early soft cap. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410895553447206912))<br />
even it comes with some sort of nerf to balance things out. these are frost &quot;scaling&quot; problems as i see them<br />
Having only some of your spells scale with some stats isn't a problem though, as long as the stats stay... (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411784892779745280))<br />
...valuable. Also, several of those DO scale with haste; you get more ILs and FFBs with more haste. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411785080411942912))<br />
as being worth the loss of dmg from continuing to stack haste beyond that point. I enjoy fast gameplay, the need to<br />
Most of the issue you're talking about is caused by the Legendary Metagem. 20% haste was a mistake; caps GCDs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411950096868065281))<br />

Might I ask what the design concept for WW Monks was? Main curiosities, Touch of Karma, their healing, and mobility+raw damage<br />
I wasn't here, but I think the fantasy of being a monk is using mystical martial arts to damage &amp; dismantle your opponent. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413085269433122816))<br />
<br />
Any closer to fixing WW monks hitbox? It's been our biggest problem since MOP release with hundreds of threads complaining.<br />
We heard that early on, and investigated and found no evidence of it actually existing. It's how WoW handles latency for all melee (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417078610185297920))<br />
<br />
.Given the changes to Mistweaving/fistweaving you discussed before, will this also change based upon healing stances?<br />
Mistweavers will count as melee, regardless of stance. Don't want them afraid to swap between stances. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/412679608182390784))<br />
<br />
how is chi explosion supposed to help brewmaster survivability?<br />
What each chi level does isn't very useful in what you saw at BlizzCon. Changes are coming to it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411959016571428864))<br />

Hey guy, would you pray tell why Crackling Jade Lightning costs mana on cast but doesn't damage?<br />
To encourage longer CJLs, over many shorter ones. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417385963610841088))<br />

Will Sacred Shield ever be made more useful for Ret Paladins PvP? A simple 10% buff and allowing it be used on 2 targets would do.<br />
We made a lot of effort to change that row in 5.2 and 5.4. It's tough to balance those spells for the 3 specs. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/411014244377690112))<br />

Started this account to ask this, is it intended for divine clarity to make mind spike spam an alternate rotation? Would rock!<br />
It's more complex than just Mind Spike spam... I believe it's been tweaked since BlizzCon, but now the rotation includes... (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/411045152510058497))<br />

IMO, Deep Healing would be good as a situational/optional talent, but too situational for a mastery<br />
Deep Healing is indeed situational. Strong for healing people that need healing. Weak for healing people that don't. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414607889974566912))<br />

Warrior haste: why not let it increase rage generated by rage gen abilities. MS = 10r* haste%. Works for all specs. Unbuff conv.<br />
That's one option that we're considering to make haste valuable for Warriors. It 'feels' a little weird, but OK. Feedback welcome. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417387244970708992))<br />

Symbiosis seems impossible to balance in PvP; Maybe it should be PvE only. What do you think?<br />
I think impossible is a strong word here but I don't deny the inequity here. Reshuffling it in WoD to be mostly defensive CDs. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/412400200355827712))<br />

Misc<br />
May be I have different psychology, but I really hate competition in game.<br />
That's a totally valid mindset for gaming, and one we attempt to support, along with others. Hard to balance at times. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417376826646724609))<br />
<br />
I really like WoW's audio, but I have two sound-related beefs that aren't really sound...1) When you fly over a zone, music changes so often you barely get to hear it. 2) Too many sounds at once in 25M raiding. Would be possible to intelligently pick the right sounds to play? I know that's a dangerous road but it's overwhelming atm<br />
I completely agree. No promises yet for WoD, but currently working on is a system that will help bring more clarity to the game. (Source (https://twitter.com/analogmad/status/417369071928098816))<br />

Easter to fight the giant vermin in Pandaria<br />
<br />
ETC<br />
<br />
Keep some achievements on a normalized gear setting to make them a challenge to get later on too. I got my Purple proto drake when it actually felt like a bit of work, now you can fly everywhere and the gear from raids is so much higher than dungeons you can solo the instances. <br />

Changes? <br />
<br />
1) Include more than one year of upgrades to the holiday gear. Keep the holidays relevant, darn it! This past round of holidays was just meh: The gear was so inferior to other readily available gear.<br />
2) New pets! And yes, new, fresh pets for the 2nd round of holidays. Notice how many folks did the Greench this year? Everyone wanted the Rotten Little Helper. Likewise, mounts.<br />
<br />
Additions? <br />
<br />
Carnival/Mardi Gras. The possibilities of fun for taking elements from this festival around the world, from Rio, New Orleans, Venice, etc., is enormous.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what changes I'd make if any. I've done just about all of them on my main so I don't do any world events anymore, but them I'm old and jaded about WoW at the moment. It's more of a 3D social network for me.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see, say, a separation between Azeroth and Draenor holidays. Add new ones that are more Draenor is origin. Certain holidays are celebrated on Azeroth or by Azeroth specific races, others on Draenor or by Draenor specific races, and the rest can be celebrated by all, via some kind of cultural mingling.<br />
<br />
I'd also be interested in seeing, at least in a visual aspect, holidays celebrated by hostile NPCs. Maybe the Gnolls have some holiday celebrating their gnoll gods, so for a week, they have brown and red totems hanging around their little NPC camps. Something to add some flavor, even if it's just cosmetic.</div></div><hr />

And maybe some unique events, like when we were on 12/21/2012, and all that mess about the Mayan Apocalipse, I thought about that special day could award some sorta FoS like &quot;Survived the Apocalipse (again)&quot; and a title, &quot;The Survivor&quot;... Well, that's my idea. New 'flash events', that may or may not occur again, rewarding stuff like pets, titles and/or Feats of Strength.<br />
<br />
For Winter's Veil, a new chain, with players escorting Santa's in his travel around Azeroth, and maybe helping him with the deliveries. And a quest chain that takes 12 months to be completed, just to show Santa in the Xmas Eve that you've been really a good kid, and deserves an awesome gift, instead coal in your socks. Cmon, Holidays in WoW should be as epic as it was when you were 5yrs old.</div></div><hr />

Well, I'm not too much into holidays events, but I'd like for ALL of them to have more tangible rewards (i.e. item usefull for progression) like it is for some events. Nothing major, something you can queue up, a fun encounter with a chance for current good loot. :)</div></div><hr />

As well, potentially having more achievements for each event would be awesome as well, potentially also awarding a new Violet Proto-Drake type mount. <br />
