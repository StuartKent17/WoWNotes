Disabling XP Gains on 110+ Characters<br />
Since the launch of Battle for Azeroth, we’ve noticed an increasing trend of players turning off XP gains at level 110 in order to repeatedly powerlevel other players’ characters at an excessive rate without increasing their own level. The intention of the XP-off feature is to allow alternate characters to stay in lower-level PvP brackets or relive lower-level content, not to purposefully halt progression in content relevant to the current expansion.<br />
<br />
To curb this behavior, we plan to implement a hotfix in the coming days that will disable the ability to turn off XP gains on characters level 110 or higher. Additionally, any character of that level who already has XP disabled will find it automatically re-enabled the next time they log in.<br />
<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays!<br />
Hi all –<br />
We just wanted to take a moment and thank all of you for supporting World of Warcraft throughout the year of 2018. We’re grateful for your passion for World of Warcraft and we’re lucky to have such dedicated players that are always giving us feedback on what to improve. Every year is always an epic journey, another chapter in the history of this great game, and we can’t wait to keep things rolling in 2019!<br />
<br />
Also, as you’d likely expect, our coverage on the forums will be down as we are out of the office over the holidays. We’ll be spending time with our family, friends, loved ones, animals, and we hope all of you have a chance to do the same.<br />
<br />
Please keep the feedback and discussions going and we’ll be back and in touch with you before you know it. We have a lot of goals next year based on a lot of the feedback you’ve graciously given us as always, and we hope you guys like what we’re working on, both in game and out of game.<br />
<br />
We hope Greatfather Winter brings you all the gifts you and your loved ones have asked for &lt;3<br />
-Community Team<br />
<br />
P.S. Remember to collect this years present under your faction’s Winter Veil Tree after the 25th, as well as knock out the Winter Veil achievements before they go away!<br />
<br />
<br />
Ivus Loot Bug Fix and Bans<br />
Just to follow up - we needed to get some extra data together to do it properly, but yes, we’ll be removing the items gained and issuing suspensions for those who abused this bug (with an increasing penalty based on how excessive the abuse was). The reason it’s taken an extra few days is that we needed to make sure we were also cleaning up any extra Titan Residuum gained from this.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't even running people who were leveling, I was just farming them to get the mounts for myself. Some guy noticed I was strong and offered to pay me for leveling him. I told him I'd do it for nothing and leveled him to 120 form 116. Why must everything be slow, tedious and unrewarding? They killed the Ox Statue agro range, they killed the 4-5 200 resource stack of quests for arathi, they killed gold missions and put in place the treasure map from doing however many expeditions that is RNG based for the gold mission. Every. Single. Thing. I liked to do in this game, or found to do, they killed. I guess I'm done and I've been a stubborn defender of Blizzard for BFA too. Losing a strong defender today, Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

You could easily pay for a month's subscription with a couple hours of IE boosting. And the fact that it didn't take any skill (just time commitment to do) made it very popular.</div></div><hr />

Always love the contrast. On one side scaling is to hard on the other leveling has no challenge.<br />

On topic though it’s petty clear something like this wouldn't be intended so not suprised they would fix it even if the fix is crude.</div></div><hr />

Oh people would still do it. No matter how easy leveling is, if theres a way to do it significantly faster then people would do it. Better solution would've been to remove xp gains from everyone in the group with a player that is xp locked and them having different dungeon finder queues like they have(had?) different battlegrounds.</div></div><hr />

No it wasn't a clever usage of game mechanics, it was never intended to work that way. It was simply exploit of the scaling system, which is clearly not suposed to be happening. &quot;Brain detected, Brain removed&quot;<br />

Either you're lying / were playing badly at 110 or you apparently upgraded all your gear a whole lot as you levelled (and had bad gear at 110). Without exception, every class and spec gets worse as it levels up in BFA, especially at 117-120.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know how extreme 110/111 twinks are right now but there were very similar things happening in Legion and they never fixed that. It was unfair to suddenly change it (after a whole expansion of it) with no warnings, after people have spent hours and tons of gold on twinking. I distinctly remember being boosted (randomly through LFG) by level 101s who were just immortal and destroyed the levelling dungeons. Some people enjoy that sort of thing more, it is exploiting the system but they deliberately made the system work that way in both expansions. Even the intro quest to BFA gives 2 ridiculously good items - they would have known twinking would happen.</div></div><hr />

My hunter didn’t have the best gear at 110 but I didn’t change the way I played at all. With azerite powers like latent poison i had no issues mass pulling and killing every thing with in a few gobals at 117-19 faster then pre 116.

&quot;The intention of the XP-off feature is to allow alternate characters to stay in lower-level PvP brackets or relive lower-level content, not to purposefully halt progression in content relevant to the current expansion.&quot; What the F does this line even mean? <br />
They made this so that people could enjoy playing at lower levels - except legion - because of a minority .<br />
Was it hard to block IE for exp locked characters ? WOW never in 10 years of playing this game i would have imagined the developers making so many shitty decisions in a so short period of time , it's sad starting to feel like i wasted my life playing and every passing day they make it more difficult for me to think about resubbing .<br />

Strange, even by BM hunter was sluggish by 117-19, my pet would actually die if I pulled too much. Obviously I'm not saying it was at all hard, but to say that it was easier than at 110/111 would be laughable in my experience.

As a demon hunter my experience was the same from 110-120 at 375ilvl . Mob scaling made the leveling a meaningless process . We were never getting on top of it, the difficulty is a plateau in bfa world content<br />

Sv could have just been a step above, i never switched out of it as I could just blow though stuff.

exactly , a few lines of code to check if xp is locked when trying to join to prevent that was too hard to do for the junior devs working on bfa.<br />

<br />
That would only be if you played a 110 you didn't play / raid on in Legion. For a 110 with good legendaries and raid gear from Legion, you get a little weaker every level until you hit 116 when you become significantly weaker because the legendaries no longer work, and then it's an uphill climbing pain in the ass to 120.</div></div><hr />

Ret falls off a HUGE cliff at 116. Legendaries and Tier set bonuses were just barely holding the spec together both in terms of damage and enjoyment, it's painfully noticeable as soon as they're taken away.</div></div><hr />

Geared 110 can kill stuffs insanely FASTER than 111-120 due to the damage and mob HP scaling. <br />

It's also ideal to have locked 110 to speed farm Island Expedition as well.</div></div><hr />

The intention of the XP-off feature is to allow alternate characters to stay in lower-level PvP brackets or relive lower-level content, not to purposefully halt progression in content relevant to the current expansion.<br />
<br />
To curb this behavior, we plan to implement a hotfix in the coming days that will disable the ability to turn off XP gains on characters level 110 or higher. Additionally, any character of that level who already has XP disabled will find it automatically re-enabled the next time they log in.<br />

With gear and level scaling you are much more powerful than a 120. 110 mobs are scaled for basic bitch geared players (like store boost characters) so being M Antorus geared or whatever makes you much stronger than the mobs in say Island Expeditions.</div></div><hr />

Why do I have my voidwalker constantly die on normal island mobs at level 116? You don't want people to run islands at 110 make them actually enjoyable on non-xp locked characters instead of being steamrolled by normal mobs unless you play one of the best solo classes in the game (like bm hunter or blood dk). <br />
<br />
If you're zoned into an island where all 3 people are levellers with non-solo friendly classes like mage, rogue, priest, it takes ages to complete the island because everyone's scared of facetanking stuff, or the opposite, someone goes, pulls and gets obliterated by mobs. <br />
<br />
This whole scaling thing is ridiculous tbh. At this moment I'm longing pre-legion non level scaled content where levelling up meant you were getting access to new zones and new dungeons and you felt you're progressing. Now it feels you're regressing. You're lumped into the same islands, the same 3 dungeons with all the other people and the higher level you are, the less you can compete and the more you feel like a deadweight. <br />
<br />
Seriously, just buff baseline 116-120 players when they're in greens (lower the power gap between 260-280 ilvl and 320+), and squish 110-115 harder. The power dropoff is the worst feeling in an MMO RPG, levelling should make you feel stronger.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't, it's just a convenient excuse to try and make it seem okay. <br />
<br />
That aside, if this was an issue then Blizzard should have changed it some time in the past 4 months the expansion has been out or at least said they feel it was a problem and intended to change it, not just try and sneak it in last second before holiday vacation and then scamper off into hiding until January.<br />

Likewise, if they didn't want people power leveling through with islands, tone down the XP gains; problem solved.<br />

Seems like an odd point you are trying to make.<br />
<br />
So just to clarify, the &quot;fun&quot; you are having is capping at 110 to gain an XP boost? <br />
<br />
Not that anyone should judge if that is what rocks your world, but you know there are a whole slew of sandbox mmos on the market where this isn't an issue right? Also, you are aware that WoW has always been designed as and known as a themepark mmo right? <br />
<br />
Hmmmm ... perhaps you were not aware since your post would otherwise look quite silly. Anyway, it always has been and still is a themepark mmo. And that means, yes, it is essentially 'designed to be on rails'. So you will probably save yourself an anheurism ( and your caps lock ) in the future if you keep that in mind, as it is likely that Blizz will continue to try and keep their game on the rails they designed it around.<br />

This. I still say make a [nMode] for people who want the old leveling experience back and prevent allied races from turning it on. How many thousands of replies do they need to know people aren't enjoying the scaling? Or another idea, how about a microholiday type deal where xp gains are doubled or tripled or whatever?<br />

For a 110 with good legendaries and raid gear from Legion, you get a little weaker every level until you hit 116 when you become significantly weaker because the legendaries no longer work, and then it's an uphill climbing pain in the ass to 120.<br />
<br />
Thats every expansion WoW has ever had. Vanilla to TBC was a massive jump up alone, mob health and damage pretty much doubled from max level zones in vanilla to Hellfire peninsula, and all your stats and ratings diminished from 61, and that was the first one and the only they didnt intentionally nerf the previous expansions gear (thus people wearing t3 into the first raid). Since then they've done more to make previous gear obsolete generally around halfway in the leveling experience (such as legendaries this time). <br />
<br />
Personally I noticed a big drop off for my hunter from 116 due to legendaries, but its was rediculously easy before 116, I could AoE 15+ mobs and kill them all and barely touched mend pet due to the leech (used both hunter legendary rings). DK, warlock and druid have all been fairly easy, did slow down a little as I got closer to 120 but thats normal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is impossible. And I mean what I say, it literally is impossible. Your secondary stats decrese while you level up. Thats just how it is. You get weaker. That alone negates your statement, but there are also legendaries that get lost between 110 and 120. I might be very wrong here, but as far as I know there is no class that is better without legendaries than with.</div></div><hr />

As it has already been mentioned, the level scaling was intended to push more people into buying the level boost. For years they had repeatedly said that there is no purpose on focusing on content that is out-dated i.e. not current. And historically at the end of every expansion, in the pre-patch for the next one they nerf that old expansion so hard. Reducing xp required by a lot but now we saw a reverse. With the poor excuse of wanting us to see the world. They want us to buy boosts. It's pretty simple imo. Messed up nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Wait, what?&quot;<br />

&quot;Well you see, we have the content scale to your level but people with a lot of gear at 110 are very powerful for level 110...&quot;<br />

&quot;And yes, because that's now totally fucked up, we decided to fix it by fucking up the ability to lock xp.&quot;<br />

<br />
Exactly, it's not an exploit. Exploits are taking advantage of a bug, or something not supposed to be in the game. Twinking has been around for a very long time, it was pretty insane in legion due to legendaries at 101, but it was expensive to make good. Now it's not only insane with legendaries+azerite gear and neck but they're super cheap to make and a ton more accessible so it's caused a bigger stir.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard: Remove it. These people just don't understand how incredible the gameplay is at 120 with their characters going backwards.<br />

as in every expansion to date, last tier equipped character from the last expansion will be powerful at the start of the next and then decrease to be powerful again... it's not something from BFA, my god.</div></div><hr />

You all have really retarded ideas of what is considered &quot;fun&quot;. If you need exploits in order to make WoW &quot;fun&quot;, then you're better off quitting and playing a different game.<br />
<br />
Besides. I think kicking people in the balls is fun, but we all can't have it our way.<br />
<br />
I see no reason for the name calling here, just makes you look like a 12 year old with attitude problems.<br />
<br />
And yes, it is fun to feel powerful. A fully Mythic geared 110 is a LOT more powerful than some 115 or so, because of the scaling. Twink boosting was a thing through all of Legion on lvl 101 toons with BoEs. To your surprise, people actually find it fun to be able to just mass pull a whole area and nuke it down, or blast through a dungeon solo.<br />
Doing that AND getting paid for it? That makes it double the fun.<br />
<br />
Just because you don't get it, doesn't mean it isn't as such. Don't be so narrow minded and jump to name calling because you don't understand how others can have fun with things you don't see as fun.<br />

i love leveling and i love it cause it has zero challenge. Some of us wanna chill while leveling and turn our brains off<br />
<br />
And there is nothing wrong with that. <br />
I would LOVE if they added more difficulties to leveling, like Warmode but Hardmode instead. So you get 5-10% more exp, but every mob hits 50% harder and you can't pull more than a mob or two at the time, and forget about soloing Rares.<br />
Then they could have the normal mode as well, because though I do find leveling rather dull and boring, I don't mind turning off my brain for 30 minutes and do a level or two on an alt every now and then, while watching Youtube/Netflix.<br />

challenge =/= fun, tbh i prefer grinds over challenge<br />
<br />
To me challenge does equal to fun. I prefer having to pick my fights and not just run around on my mount pulling all the mobs then aoe them down. Which is why I've had a blast on a private vanilla server with leveling the past month.</div></div><hr />

Exp locking, or twinking as it is also called, have always been considered fun by some.<br />
<br />
The thing is that we where able to exp lock at 101 in whole Legion, doing this EXACT same thing and it wasn't a problem. Now it suddenly is.<br />
<br />
<br />
They should stop removing things, and instead add things to the game. It's not like this was hurting the game in any way shape or form.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
So it isn't as much about the fact they even thought about removing exp locking at 110, but more the fact that they keep removing stuff from the game, stuff some people find fun. Also the fact that they always tend to look at the short way to fix their shit, instead of actually looking into the problem, which in this case is the level scaling.</div></div><hr />

I have exp locked characters at every former expansions max level, most of them decked out in then current gear. It's fun for me to sometimes log on one of them, do a dungeon or two, roam around the old max level zones a bit. You know, to have a little variety in my game. Without exp lock I could just look at them in Stormwind for fear of creeping up to ding next level. I have a lv60 char with Thunderfury, all its magic would be gone at 61.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I think it's time to give players the option to decide if they want to level with normal (IE new player) speed or something like 5 times as fast.<br />
<br />
You could even make a gold sink out of it. Instead of paying other players to boost you just sell one time use +50% exp heirlooms for lots of gold. So veteran players could decide how many armor slots they use normal heirlooms vs expensive but better until they like the leveling speed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you talking about? You can make several characters, but you don't have to. Your 1 character can be all classes, and change between them at will. And &quot;Grind your ass off&quot;? You gain a big bonus to EXP gain if you have a class at a higher level already. You don't need to level multiple classes to unlock 1 anymore either. You don't need Gladiator + Whitemage to become Paladin. Gladiator just turns into Paladin at 30.</div></div><hr />

And yes, it is fun to feel powerful. A fully Mythic geared 110 is a LOT more powerful than some 115 or so, because of the scaling. Twink boosting was a thing through all of Legion on lvl 101 toons with BoEs. To your surprise, people actually find it fun to be able to just mass pull a whole area and nuke it down, or blast through a dungeon solo.<br />
Doing that AND getting paid for it? That makes it double the fun.<br />
<br />
Just because you don't get it, doesn't mean it isn't as such. Don't be so narrow minded and jump to name calling because you don't understand how others can have fun with things you don't see as fun.<br />

And there is nothing wrong with that. <br />
I would LOVE if they added more difficulties to leveling, like Warmode but Hardmode instead. So you get 5-10% more exp, but every mob hits 50% harder and you can't pull more than a mob or two at the time, and forget about soloing Rares.<br />
Then they could have the normal mode as well, because though I do find leveling rather dull and boring, I don't mind turning off my brain for 30 minutes and do a level or two on an alt every now and then, while watching Youtube/Netflix.<br />

To me challenge does equal to fun. I prefer having to pick my fights and not just run around on my mount pulling all the mobs then aoe them down. Which is why I've had a blast on a private vanilla server with leveling the past month.<br />
<br />
Then does it really matter if you're just going to go play vanilla anyway?</div></div><hr />

Not sure why the sarcasm happened, but yes you can expect changes. Blizzard has a long history of changes like this.<br />
<br />
It happened because that's a poor response, I don't see them &quot;fixing&quot; other unintended shit that's been around since the dawn of time? They for some reason have this hardon for people leveling fast and afaik they haven't said why they want leveling to be slow as snot shit.<br />

Really, you don’t see them fix other unintended shit? How about encounter exploits such as: pulling mobs out of the room on Grand Widow in Naxx to allow zerging the boss. Changing the way Rogues Fan of Knives interrupt works due to cheesing Anub’s encounter in ToC. Changing how Saronite Bombs worked during the Lich King encounter. Changing how the glider works with Emerald Winds that people used to basically allow flight in Legion. Changing WQs to not be completed in raid groups. Now, most recently the XP lock change. Changing SV Hunters Serpent Sting dot mechanic during WoD. There are multiple other examples and these are just the most obvious ones sticking out at this time.<br />
Sure, there have been others that are probably still around as Blizz probably doesn’t think them to terrible or as big of an issue as others, but to take time to act like Blizzard never changes anything due to an unexpected side effect or consequence of the system is asinine and ignorant.<br />
Your posts are also becoming hypocritical. You say you love playing and leveling on private servers which is a grinding, slow process and then complain Blizzard is trying to slow down leveling. <br />
You also state fuck scaling, something that has been praised by many people due to allowing people to level in every zone without having to skip entire story arcs and is generally only complained about by max level players due to increasing length of time to complete world objectives.<br />
At this point you are just starting to sound like you are hating on BfA for no other reason than just to have a point to try and be relevant on an Internet forum for a few minutes.</div></div><hr />

You just casually excluded the last part of that sentence &quot;that's been around since the dawn of time&quot; your examples will have to be things that's been around since BC or wrath. Current exploits I obviously see fixed.<br />

I never said that, I was responding to someone elses quote. However, since we are here, Vanilla/Classic is a different game from retail. I expect to level &quot;slow&quot; when classic comes out. I don't expect to level slow in retail because I haven't in forever.<br />

I don't hate BFA, all expansions are the same to me because all I do is level mostly, I hate scaling and the leveling speed, BFA is fine otherwise in my eyes.</div></div><hr />

Best quote &quot;The best way to keep the user experience fair and enjoyable is to properly test their product before releasing them.﻿ You can't keep the game fair with bugs because there will be loop holes, unless Blizzard manually review each user who exploit a bug.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was something different to aim towards. <br />
Gearing your twink up, in other ways than a m+ grind and high level raiding.<br />
<br />
You do other things to achieve that, and then you get actually rewarded, because scalling on the gear is much more normal, so you get tons of stats. <br />
So you could have like 50% crit, and it's more fun to play than being hardcapped at 30. <br />
At least for me. <br />
<br />
You then can take that character and obliterate island expeditions. You feel so powerful, and rightfully so, as you worked for it. <br />
And you can even make some cash with it.<br />
Literally the only time i enjoyed doing island expeditions was on my 100 dh, who isnt even a twink, but has like 220 ilvl or sth.<br />

Like not falling through the floor in temple of snek? Yeah still happened to me like 2 weeks ago.<br />
Or maybe infected mobs aggroing mobs through the walls in wayccrest?<br />
How about the fact that by default u cannot place ground abilities (like death and decay or blizzard) out of line of sight (which you shouldnt) and yet it happens once every few runs that dnd places on a fucking roof, or lamp? (didnt happen in legion, at least not to dk blood i run m+ with, who is my irl friend).<br />
<br />
<br />
And there's so many more, but those are just on top of my head.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noxina</div><div class="date">2018-12-25, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You just flat out admitted that people do it to get paid. Fun doesn't even factor in the equation. What is fun about mindlessly facerolling mobs all day? And don't give me that &quot;fun is subjective&quot; bullshit. I guarantee that if people couldn't profit from it, they wouldn't even bother.<br />
<br />
People do bother though. It is a reason I sold 101 BoEs for a couple of gold caps in Legion. People LOVE the feeling of being powerful, that combined with the overflow of gold there was in Legion made it a gold mine to flip those items.<br />
If it was boring, they wouldnt do it, because there was hundreds of better ways to earn gold. Just because you dont like something, doesnt mean it is boring. So yes, fun IS subjective.<br />

leveling in any game after you've done it once sucks, don't just pin this on blizz.<br />
<br />
Leveling is a lot more fun in other games than WoW though. <br />
Lets take PoE (Path of Exile) for instance, I level up a bunch of toons every season there and have actual fun doing it. Another example is Vanilla WoW on private servers, leveling is actually fun there compared to current WoW.<br />
<br />
So I am pinning it on blizzard for absolutely screwing it up over the expansions.<br />
<br />

<br />
locking exp for twinks is totally fine. not for powerleveling doods.<br />
<br />
How so? How is it any different from selling Udlir, +10 or Conq Cap?<br />
<br />

<br />
Then does it really matter if you're just going to go play vanilla anyway?<br />
<br />
It matters, because me and a bunch of others have the opinion that Blizzard/Activison have completely ruined the game over the expansions. If the FIRST edition had a better (subjectively ofc) leveling experience, then wouldn't it just make sense to complain and hope they'd actually do something about the game before it actually dies? It is a reason guilds are dying one by one, the game is losing customers every day. <br />
<br />
So ask your self this - why is WoW losing players? And shouldnt we, the consumers, voice our concerns so they might do something?</div></div><hr />
