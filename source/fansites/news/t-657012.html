Achievements<br />
I think it's too early in the PTR testing to see all the achievements for the bosses, only one achievement is available for the moment. <br />

Maybe. Excuse my ignorance, but not kept up fully with testing. Have all the modes been tested? i.e. 5/5 heroic, 10/10 heroic, 25/25 heroic?<br />

Because beating a boss in the PTR is an achievement. Clearly, he's in need of buffs.<br />

I'm surprised he's being tested in PTR to begin with, but...eh...</div></div><hr />

It's not too hard. We got him down to 15-30% several times, not to mention that a lot of dps were pushing around 2-2.5k (it was a pug unfortunately). It's easily doable with half-decent pugs doing 3k dps on 10 man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We got him down to 30% also, I just mean that weren't really able to kill him before the enrage timer came up. It should be nerfed for 10 man since it's less dps from the people killing the frozen balls. Let's say 30 min vs 20 that we have now.</div></div><hr />

We're getting a very small arena, T2.5/6.5 type recolors of the same armor types, and even the hard mode gear doesn't get a unique name and is just tagged with &quot;heroic&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is an intermission patch; Ulduar was huge, so you can bet Icecrown will be too, or whatever raid comes after this one. More than likely, they're focused on Icecrown and this is serving as an intermission patch to keep people tied over so we don't have an extremely large gap between content patches like in The Burning Crusade. <br />
<br />
Truth be told, no one should've expected much from the Argent Coliseum to begin with, because the concept is extremely narrow and there's not much to explore with it at all. The star of this patch is the changes to other parts of the game. Enjoy some quick content, while we wait for the next real raid zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a PTR.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with seeing an easy boss, it's even possible that the bosses are made easy BECAUSE of the testing. <br />
<br />
Twists that make the bosses harder will be inserted later.<br />
<br />
For example, i seem to recall that ignis constructs could be offtanked safely in the PTR without buffing him, and that stormcaller P3 was tauntable to keep him in place. Those were edited to be more dangerous in live. No reason to think they won't do the same here.</div></div><hr />

Thanks. You can find my UI at http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=38438.msg1096905#msg1096905<br />
<br />
The fight's mechanics are pretty fun. Of course it's undertuned. All PTR bosses are undertuned. The first nights of testing of most always just script testing, making sure the abilities and functionality of the core fight is there and works as intended. It's all about tuning now. Would you call it easy if the mobs all hit twice as hard and the enrage timer was cut in half? No, it'd be a great balance between trying to keep the adds at bay while killing Anub in that final burn. <br />
<br />
In short: Tuning is easy. Scripting is hard. Guess which one they test first...</div></div><hr />

What a fucking lackluster Druid Q&amp;A... The interesting questions weren't even addressed... Bear survivability my ass, what about bear AE threat??? Bears will be &quot;too good&quot; in 3.2 - uhm, WHAT? I really don't get Blizzard, do they even PLAY the classes they comment about?<br />
<br />
Resto druid Q&amp;A is even worse... Not one real answer to anything. What about &quot;All other healing classes have been improved (Paladin, Shaman) to be even more effective in group heal. Now why is the Resto Druid not improved to be even a little bit better in single target heal?&quot;<br />
<br />
Really really disappointed. Especially this whole Tree of Life might be like metamorphosis crap...</div></div><hr />

We're getting a very small arena, T2.5/6.5 type recolors of the same armor types, and even the hard mode gear doesn't get a unique name and is just tagged with &quot;heroic&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is an intermission patch; Ulduar was huge, so you can bet Icecrown will be too, or whatever raid comes after this one. More than likely, they're focused on Icecrown and this is serving as an intermission patch to keep people tied over so we don't have an extremely large gap between content patches like in The Burning Crusade. <br />
<br />
Truth be told, no one should've expected much from the Argent Coliseum to begin with, because the concept is extremely narrow and there's not much to explore with it at all. The star of this patch is the changes to other parts of the game. Enjoy some quick content, while we wait for the next real raid zone.<br />
<br />
Main problem is that we get &quot;filler&quot; raid content simply due to another arena season - even Blizzard said so. That itself wouldn't be so horrible if they didn't basically trivialize main content like Ulduar with the change of the badge system and a shitty, easy-mode raid instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We all know these fights wont be this easy, just like the ulduar fights were way easier on ptr.<br />
also.. how will 3 226 items, and 2 t8 pieces completely trivialize ulduar? Its still a worthy dungeon with that gear.<br />
I really hope they will indeed make this patch raids hard like hell, make it true gearchecks, cause last thing ANYONE wants is to roll into t9 that easy</div></div><hr />

Sigh, I really hate &quot;wow is so easy&quot; posts they're so stupid. WoW is doing what every other game out there does. Its giving you a choice between easy, normal, and hardmode so that every player can pass through content. Doing it on harder modes gets you more epeen stuff, so i really dont see what the problem is and you also have to remember: There is no RIGHT difficulty lv.</div></div><hr />

Very few guilds in the world have downed Algalon and I think that the Ulduar zone has a good 2 months of life left in it for the overwheling majority of guilds but now we will be pushed on to the next tier and probably go back to Ulduar with the massivley better Coliseum gear that will make Ulduar a lot easier.

As i remember Blizzard did this before on a test realm, don't remember if it was public or not but i was on that testing realm, battling Nefarion(end boss of BWL for no- old timers), as one of the first with other people on the realm.

It looks like they have nerfed the content so they can test it all from a bug point of veiw, if hes Yogg 0 hard then theres no reason to test if all you see if a Bunch of guilds whiping on phase X, make it easy so you make sure it works, then get your tuning forks out.

Trial of the Crusader - Final Boss PTR Testing<br />
The final boss for the Trial of the Crusader is now available for testing on the North American PTRs. Pardon the last minute announcement of this, we're still having some technical difficulties on the North American PTRs and we weren't sure if this testing was going to be available. <br />
<br />

Yes. Also, they will likely buff 25 man and maybe nerf 10 man. The 10 man version might be where they want it but who knows.</div></div><hr />

during his burrow, he's halted completely once he hit's permafrost. you have the entire raid stand on permafrost and no one takes a single point of damage during that phase.</div></div><hr />

Ghostcrawler: We think bears have felt inferior because for a long time we basically said “You are designed to be inferior.” Sometimes old perceptions die hard. Bears are not inferior tanks in Ulduar and it’s possible their survivability is too high in 3.2.<br />
<br />
.......bears survivability too high in 3.2? they're nerfing dodge and agility to dodge ratios... that's going to kill druids survivability and scaling. the only thing a feral druid scales with anymore is agility, it's our only survival stat. stam just doesn't stack up anymore but it is still 2nd best and we're still trailing far behind from DK's/warriors/pallies.<br />
<br />
Community Team: Savage Defense has been the source of a number of debates as players feel it is somewhat lackluster and doesn’t provide enough of a benefit, especially in PvP.<br />
<br />
Q: Do we have any plans to change and/or improve Savage Defense?<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler: We’re pretty happy with Savage Defense for now. It accomplishes its goals, which were to make dps stats more useful on leather and to keep bears from hitting the armor cap so easily. You might consider it lackluster if you’re counting on it saving your life, but it does account for a lot of damage over the course of a boss fight. <br />

savage defense is a worthless skill imho. it's nice for solo grinding when it will actually absorb all or most of an attack but it's nearly useless in a raid. i get to absorb one attack and take roughly 2k damage off that attack. it also doesn't scale with AoE tanking which means druids will still take a vast amount of damage more than a warrior or a pally. before 3.2 this was nearly equal to the average warrior/pallies absorb, but now with block value being doubled this makes savage defense.. once again fall far far behind.</div></div><hr />

It's always funny to see the people making these statements generally have not done any of the Hardmodes...<br />

<br />
3.2 is good patch. It won't be perfect for elitists nor hardcore raiders, as this patch is for casuals (mounts changes, badges etc). They release fast, enjoyable raid, which everyone can clear within few hours. They allow most of casuals to get T9 easily. Is that bad? I don't think so. This way in 3.3 casuals can visit Icecrown and kill Arthas, and hardcores will have their achievements and hard modes.</div></div><hr />

and really people who claim to be hardcore are usually the most casual of us all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aleom</div><div class="date">2009-07-15, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh, I really hate &quot;wow is so easy&quot; posts they're so stupid. WoW is doing what every other game out there does. Its giving you a choice between easy, normal, and hardmode so that every player can pass through content. Doing it on harder modes gets you more epeen stuff, so i really dont see what the problem is and you also have to remember: There is no RIGHT difficulty lv.<br />
<br />
I don't think people are complaining about the split between hard/easy modes, what they (and myself) are complaining about is that just because a boss HAS a hard mode doesn't mean that the default difficulty of the boss should be as easy as some of them are. That's all really. <br />
<br />
Ask yourself this question: If there were NO hardmodes, do you think the default versions of the bosses would be as easy as they are? <br />
<br />
I am very confident the answer would be &quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
If the Tempest Keep, Kael'thas fight was built with a hardmode in mind, do you think his default difficulty would have been what it is? With you facing his advisors individually, his legendary weapons, his advisors at the same time, then deal with two (2) phases of Kael'thas + phoenix adds and a shield you have to burn through and spell to interrupt? <br />
<br />
Again, I'm confident the answer here is a resounding &quot;No.&quot; All the challenge of the fight would be pushed aside for the Hard Mode version (maybe pushing a button on the wall to activate it) and his default difficulty would probably be Phase 1, 4 and 5, minus his shield or Phoenix adds. <br />
<br />
Easy mode of Ulduar is stupid easy and Hard Mode of ulduar is...well it's actually pretty hard and challenging, but once you get it down it's not too bad. I simply think that the default versions of the encounters shouldn't be so easy. If there were NO hardmodes, I'm positive the difficulty of the boss would be somewhere in between easy and hard as they are now. <br />
<br />
I love/want hard modes, I DON'T love/want watered a down version just because I have the option to up the difficulty, I want them both to be challenging.</div></div><hr />
