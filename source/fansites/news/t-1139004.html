Mists of Pandaria UI Changes Update<br />
Several more UI changes have been made since our last post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2754-UI-Changes-The-Veiled-Stair-X-53-Rocket-Retiring-Misc-Changes-Blue-Posts-Comic).<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions have had subgrouping added, both for cooking and others where appropriate. <br />
You may now blacklist up to two battlegrounds when queuing by selecting the thumbs down next to them. You are unable to blacklist the Call to Arms battleground. <br />
A button has been added for the Mists of Pandaria cinematic. (No, it doesn't work yet!)<br />
A new loot roll status window has been added that allows you to see what each player rolled and the outcome of their roll.<br />
Account wide achievements that you can make progress towards on any character are now flagged with a blue coloring. You can see the status of every achievement on WoWDB (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/239-25000-honorable-kills) in the Quick Info of each achievement's page.<br />
The spellbook now talks about what has changed and how to use the core abilities of your spec. <br />
The Dungeon Journal now has unique art backgrounds for each expansion<br />

Today was a holiday in the US, so the blue posters were silent, but there was a Diablo III Game Design Update (http://www.diablofans.com/blizz-tracker/topic/224973-game-design-update/) and other blue posts. If you want to read them all, see the latest two news posts on Diablofans (http://www.diablofans.com/)!<br />
Finding and Trading Gear<br />
This isn't a new concept. In Diablo II gear was randomized and so absolutely ridiculously rare that you could almost be guaranteed to never find the exact item you were looking for just by farming for it yourself. To be the best you had to trade items with others, as you might find an extremely rare item, they may be willing to trade for yours. If you wanted to get ahead within any reasonable amount of time you had to trade. Now, Diablo II had one thing going for it which was the mass proliferation of dupes for the rarest items, which completely tanked its economy and quickly allowed anyone to gear themselves in the best possible items for nearly nothing. In Diablo III you don't have that luxury, you need to actually find the rare items, or trade for them.<br />
<br />
Now, you have a couple options, you can jump into our Trading Forum, post up your item/s and then meet someone in-game and barter a trade. You can also use the in-game Trade channel, and again barter trades. Or you can use the auction house system. How you trade items is up to you, bartering out of game, bartering in-game, the AH for gold, or real money once it launches. We're not forcing anyone to do anything, and if you don't ever want to trade with other players that's your choice as well, but due to the nature of drops in Diablo games, if you want to be the best you need to trade.<br />
<br />
The difference in Diablo 2 was that you could solo act 4 and 5 with gear you farmed yourself. In Diablo 3 you have no chance in act 2 and onward unless you buy gear from the auction house. The best gear drops in the later acts (Jay said there was one tier of drops in each Act), so there will be a looooong while until I even have a chance at starting farming the best gear. Basically I have to gear up so I have a chance at gearing up so I have a chance at getting the good loot. In D2, I could start farming the best loot the game had to offer by myself.<br />
Good point! Yes, Diablo III has an additional difficulty level, Inferno, with a very steep difficulty curve. One bit of misinformation is that loot is static in where it drops, but in fact the loot table bands are quite large. For example the &quot;Inferno Act I loot&quot; has a chance to drop in Hell Act IV as much as it does Inferno Act II. You will need to farm Inferno Act I to get a shot at those higher level items to drop so you can continue progressing.

<br />
Diablo III - Game Design Update<br />
As more and more players begin to perfect their character builds and progress into Diablo III’s higher difficultly levels, some of the most prominent feedback lately has been about game balance and design, and that’s what we’re here to talk about today. As with any new game, gameplay issues are inevitable, and we hear a lot of feedback regarding what‘s balanced, what’s not, and everything else in between. We recently made some decisions to adjust (or outright nerf) a few class skills, and today we wanted to explain our overall philosophy on design changes -- as well as give some insight into some more changes that are coming up.<br />
<br />
Before we get to that, though, we thought it'd be fun to share a few interesting stats we've collected since Diablo III's release:<br />
<br />
<br />
On average players have created 3 characters each<br />
80% of characters are between levels 1 and 30<br />
1.9% of characters have unlocked Inferno difficulty<br />
54% of Hardcore players chose a female character<br />
The majority of Hardcore deaths (35%) occur in Act I Normal<br />
The most common level 60 build in the game is only used by 0.7% of level 60 characters of that class (not including Passive diversity)<br />
The most used runes for each class at level 60 are Barbarian: Best Served Cold, Demon Hunter: Lingering Fog, Wizard: Mirror Skin, Monk: Peaceful Repose, Witch Doctor: Numbing Dart<br />
<br />

I would be in favour of a built-in Recount, however I fear that they are not doing so as they don't (and shouldn't) consider numbers the end-all and be-all of the PvE aspect of the game.</div></div><hr />

Those that come here use the site to chat with other players regarding things whether that be for news, help, recruitment, etc. The people who are still struggling through normal Diablo III likely won't even know this site exists. Thus the poll will skew toward the higher end rather than the lower end and ultimately contradict what Blizzard's numbers are. Of course the poll won't be accurate because of this. So I wouldn't take much stock in it ... especially since people lie and you can vote multiple times in the same poll. I vote once, refresh the page, and I can vote again. Blizzard has the true numbers so they're the ones to be believed over a poll on a website that the majority of the player base likely doesn't even know exists. What's the most these polls ever see? Like 100,000? And how many of those are duplicates and how many are from liars? I'd trust Blizzard over anonymous polls any day. I'll admit, I'm playing nightmare and am stuck on act 2 due to lack of gear. May try again with the patch coming up, but I'll guess I'll see.<br />

Your vote only counts once, voting again just changes it. The poll isn't to contradict what they said, just see how our visitor base is progressing. To evaluate that you have to ignore most of the votes for inferno!</div></div><hr />

Manually, unless they implement it on the armory. It should be fairly similar on most characters. A level 11 monk and my level 89 mage are within 20 points of each other. Not that many achievements are not account wide after you earn them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not necessarily, people that get to inferno probably have more then one character which skews the numbers. every person that is in inferno has 1-2 characters that are between level's 1-30 plus all the others that are actually level 1-30. also you have to remember not everyone that plays diablo comes to mmo-champ.</div></div><hr />

I know there are those with more than 1 inferno toon, say something like 20% of those with 1 inferno toon have 2, so maybe 300,000 people have unlocked inferno, thats still actually 23% of players. not 1.9%</div></div><hr />

Bliz' numbers are for characters, not accounts. If you have, say, 1 char for Inferno and then 9 act 1 normal chars it is counted as 10% inferno.<br />
<br />
Then count all the millions of casuals who will not visit a site like mmo-champion and the numbers seem pretty accurate. Similarly WoW polls showing that mmo-champ readers are typically raiders and have a much higher percent of heroic clears then the whole average of the userbase.</div></div><hr />

300000 is not 23% of 7 million, it's 4.3%<br />

MMO-Champion visitors are pro. or lying. or a little of both.<br />
<br />
on the Achievement WowDB. I can't figure out much sense in which achievements are account wide and which are not. I looked up The Immortal to see if I'll be able to use that title on other characters, and it's not account wide, which doesn't surprise me. But some don't make sense. Kingslayer is, Destroyer's End isn't. Heroic Fall of the Lich King is, Light of Dawn isn't. Glory of the Cataclysm Raider is, Heroic Al'Akir isn't. Similarly, Glory of the Dragon Soul Raider is, but Heroic: Madness of Deathwing isn't. Secrets of Ulduar is, Keepers of Ulduar isn't. <br />
<br />
Can anyone enlighten me? I expected a lot more to be account wide. Don't really see a point in making a meta account wide, but all the pieces and the titles not, especially when the meta mount will be account wide anyways. The D3 account-wide achievement system is more what I was expecting, where any character counts, with maybe some uncool but unsurprising exceptions for Feats of Strength like Immortal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I transferred my main over that has 11110 achievement points, on beta it only has something like 3500 as some of the grind quest information is missing (all the squirrels/gold etc) but the number of achievement points seem fairly consistent across all characters.<br />
<br />
Another thing to note is that all my feats of strength are currently showing across all chars including Hand of A'dal which people have listed as not being shared.<br />
<br />
/edit<br />
<br />
checked all characters on my beta account and all achievement points are identical at 3945, the only way I could verify this is completing an achievement on my panda that is already marked as completed so level 20/quests cleared in a zone would be the easiest but I don't have time right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went back and clarified the wording a little bit. For example, once you earn The Keepers of Ulduar (10 player) (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/2890) on one character, it becomes account wide on all your characters. You must kill all four of those bosses on one character though, so progress on it is not account wide. After you earn an achievement, almost every single one is account wide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok that makes sense, thank you. Account Wide meaning in this case 'now can be completed through the efforts of more than one character', not 'now any character gets credit once you earn this achievement'.<br />
<br />
Looking at them now though, there are still some disappointments. It's cool that, for example, if I happened to get 'Don't Get Cocky Kid' on an alt, it would count towards my main's progress toward 'Battle of Gilneas All-Star'. But, unfortunately all of the Win 100 Isle of Conquests, or Disarm 50 Bombs, or Defend 50 Nodes achievements don't count up all your characters' wins/disarmed/defended. Those seem like sub-meta-achievements to me.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how that is exclusive to one another. 1.9% of characters have unlocked Inferno. 80% are 30 and under. That still leaves 18% in between those two. Which would seem to indicate that people who play characters above level 30 dedicate themselves to those characters, and have a significant stable of under 30 alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So either Blizzard have no clue about their own game statistics, or a shitload of people choose to lie in an anonymous internet poll. What the hell, guys?!<br />

<br />
Well I've made 7 characters (most are level 1s) and only 1 has gotten past 30 (and that character is in Inferno). So of my characters, 86% are below level 30, and only 14% have reached Inferno. Believing that a little over a third of the people who visit MMO-Champion regularly (and would vote in a poll) are in the 10% of 'most progressed' players who've started D3 is easier than believing that a little over a third of the readers here are in the top 2%.<br />
<br />
It's kinda like the statistics back a while about how small a % of level 85s had beaten Ragnaros. Most of the toons that weren't clearing that bar hadn't even looked at it.</div></div><hr />

Actually, what this poll shows is just how unrepresentative the mmo-champ population is of the blizz population is general. Everyone knows that people on mmo-champ are much more likely to be in the game's more elite players, and the incredible difference in this poll and blizz numbers quantifies that a bit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chaud</div><div class="date">2012-05-29, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok now I'm confused again, Chaud. Wooly Mammoth (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/2077-wooly-mammoth) is listed as Account Wide, as are Frostwolf Howler (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/706-frostwolf-howler) and A Brew-Fast Mount (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/3496-a-brew-fast-mount) (and all the other FoS mounts). However, Vial of the Sands (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/5749-vial-of-the-sands) and Grand Expedition Yak (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/7386-grand-expedition-yak) are not. <br />
<br />
Will the Yak not be an account-wide mount? It doesn't make sense for any specific mount achievement to be 'account-wide' under my second understanding of the term.<br />
<br />
The Yak is currently one of the few mounts that is not account wide. I didn't include that in the post a few days ago because we have no idea if it is final and people tend to start complaining before thinking that it could change.</div></div><hr />

I do not play Diablo yet, so help me out here. Hardcore difficulty is basicly just normal mode, but that your character can die and not be played again? Or is the playing difficulty also increased?</div></div><hr />
