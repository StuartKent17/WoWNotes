The rest of the changes look good immolate with a longer duration is a godsend, no more hand of gul'dan not refreshing it. I'm somewhat glad to see the ISF changes since it was one more thing to keep track of, but it is just being replaced with having to fit Fel Spark (4pcT11) into the rotation and keybinds.

<br />
Shadow Orb Power (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/77486/shadow-orb-power/) now increases the damage done by your Shadow Orbs by 21.6%, up from 20%. Each point of Mastery increases damage by an additional 1.5%, up from 1.3%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When are they going to realize that it isn't the mastery itself that's the problem. It's the awful Harnessed Shadows (http://www.wowhead.com/spell=78228) they need to fix. Sometimes it takes up to 5 full Mind Flay's to get one orb. Which is pure awful. <br />
<br />
Thus making Crit more valuable than Mastery.</div></div><hr />

The resto druid changes seem interesting. Buff to mastery and a cooldown reducement to WG - ok. But a nerf to the duration of ToL, why? I mean, it wasn't really that imba, was it? Not that the change makes much difference.</div></div><hr />

Not quite the mastery change unholy was hoping for, but with buffed disease damage from virulence (ps, hooray for no longer needing to take a +hit talent) perhaps it'll be on even keel with crit/expertise, at least. I doubt it'll outpace haste as a preferred secondary until cap, though.<br />

Its like the frost mastery shadow version I think its fair and easy to balance for them, frost got a frost aoe you got a shadow aoe we have frost disease you have a shadow disease, we have a frost dmg strike you have a shadow strike, I think the shadow dmg buff is better than you might think and i fairly think you are wrong about the ''Not quite the mastery change unholy was hoping for'' IMO lots of unholy DK were hoping for this.....I love what they did to sudden doom to kill the DW unholy spec, who wasnt expecting a only proc on main hand mechanic???</div></div><hr />

<br />
They still keep trying to make all specs of mages viable in raids. That doesn't really work out in pvp when frost has such insane control. Fire and arcane should be good in pve and maybe have some pvp implications, but frost should never have enough damage to do well in raids. It just can't. Otherwise you end up with a spec that has the best control in the game plus amazing damage. There has to be some give and take.</div></div><hr />

Why would every class need 3 viable pve specs if every spec is dps? It's one thing if your class can have multiple roles, but when you're a pure, all specs fulfill one role. You don't need more than two viable pve specs. You already have plenty of choice in pve regards. Now it's just adding more to the imbalance of frost just for the sake of &quot;oh but i want to deal frost damage instead of fire.&quot;</div></div><hr />

It's one thing if your class can have multiple roles, but when you're a pure, all specs fulfill one role. You don't need more than two viable pve specs. You already have plenty of choice in pve regards. Now it's just adding more to the imbalance of frost just for the sake of &quot;oh but i want to deal frost damage instead of fire.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well then why don't they delete one of the specs for DPS? They can call the other two PvE and PvP. While they're at it, they should remove all resistance types and just have &quot;Magic Resistance&quot;. They can remove all magic spell types and just have a few types of spells that every DPS has: Bolt, Instant, and AoE. Tanks can have an ability called &quot;Gain Threat&quot; and &quot;Mitigate More Damage&quot;.<br />
<br />
There's something to be said about enjoying the flavors of different specs in an all-DPS class. You probably don't understand because you tunnel through boss fights and hope for the highest number at the end. Maybe not, but that's my initial guess.</div></div><hr />

You probably don't understand what I'm getting at though seeing as you're too busy trying to insult me instead of actually talking about the subject at hand.<br />
<br />
The subject at hand is childish and moot, as these aren't official in the slightest. Even the author said this is a simple compilation of changes from tooltip comparisons. I think I'm the only one NOT worked up about the changes, and I'm an Arcane mage. Do you know what I saw when I looked at mages? Frost buffs and Fire buffs, the two specs everyone agrees are better.<br />
<br />
I admitted I could be wrong about you, but there was too much defeat in your sentiment. We have three specs, they should all be viable for enjoying the game in any situation. They pigeonholed in Vanilla, and it was dumb. I very much appreciate their attempt at allowing all three specs viability in both PvE and PvP, especially when they've done a good job of making them &quot;feel&quot; different. Perhaps being a paladin clouds that because you have black and white specs: Healing, DPS, Tank. There's no variety in the DPS spec, it's just the damage spec. <br />
<br />
Also, if someone says they want to do frost damage over fire, they should have that right.</div></div><hr />

Nerfing Black Arrow makes so little sense. That thing barely does more damage than a Fire Trap and that's because you can simply trap launch it after a WS or something, besides costing considerably less focus (or none at all if you don't launch it).<br />
<br />
Nerfing AoE AND single target capabilities of Survival on top of their base capabilities (reduced agility talent passive) to the ground seems their way to go, instead of buffing the other hunter trees. Better make sure they're all underpowered instead of looking for a middle ground.</div></div><hr />

MY PROPOSED FIX FOR PVE / PVP NERFS &amp; BUFFS<br />
<br />
Modify Spells, so when in an 'arena' or 'pvp' environment, they act a certain way.<br />
Example - &gt; LOH can't be used in arena.. so why not just modify all spells for PVE and PVP. That way you dont have to worry about pissing off one group, while pleasing another?<br />

Even the author said this is a simple compilation of changes from tooltip comparisons. I think I'm the only one NOT worked up about the changes, and I'm an Arcane mage. Do you know what I saw when I looked at mages? Frost buffs and Fire buffs, the two specs everyone agrees are better.<br />
<br />
I admitted I could be wrong about you, but there was too much defeat in your sentiment. We have three specs, they should all be viable for enjoying the game in any situation. They pigeonholed in Vanilla, and it was dumb. I very much appreciate their attempt at allowing all three specs viability in both PvE and PvP, especially when they've done a good job of making them &quot;feel&quot; different. Perhaps being a paladin clouds that because you have black and white specs: Healing, DPS, Tank. There's no variety in the DPS spec, it's just the damage spec. <br />
<br />
Also, if someone says they want to do frost damage over fire, they should have that right.<br />
<br />
Lol. So apparently aesthetics are more important than balance? Ok. Let's just let everyone do insane damage in everything since that's more important than the game actually being fair.<br />
<br />
I play a pally now but I've had a high level of every class except shammy, priest, and druid. I played mage a lot in wrath. It didn't feel at all like I needed more than fire or arcane. Both specs were interesting and fun in their own way. You don't need three dps specs. Two is enough. There is a line where aesthetics take a back seat to balance. Just because you like the visuals of one spec over the other doesn't justify it being overpowered because of pve affecting pvp.</div></div><hr />

Nerfing explosive shot, however, makes me happy. If anything BA needed a slight buff to always be the worthwhile choice.<br />
<br />
I'm amazed that these survival changes were even proposed after the 5% agil nerf, which is going to have long-term repercussions that will probably need to iron out later. It wouldn't bother me so much if both Marks and BM weren't so gimped, but the poster from a few messages up is right, they're just cratering surv instead of balancing the 3 specs.<br />
<br />
In PVE this change may be fine, but in arena? My battlegroup has 1 hunter above 2k in 2v2 and 4 above 2k in 3v3. Our representation is crap right now, because our class is crap in pvp. Nerfing one of the primary pvp specs (only other one is really Marks if you're going all control and saying eff-it to damage, especially now that BM cant use heroism) so hard on it's two iconic damage abilities is going to just gimp us even more to the point where no team worth a crap will even consider a hunter.<br />
<br />
Christ, can MM get a little love and take it's place back as the PVP spec that people are actually a little wary of? 3.5 second aimshots are just impossible to pull off with any sort of consistency, and chimera does slightly more on the ptr than it used to....and it isn't nearly enough for a focus starved spec.<br />
<br />
Please help my hunter be of moderate worth in pvp blizz, this is getting silly.</div></div><hr />

If I understand you correctly, you're completely fine with Arcane Mages being useless in both PvE and PvP? While I agree with you, that not all 3 of your specs should do fine in PvE or PvP, at least it should be viable in one of those aspects. Arcane is in neither of them. To be honest, I am growing a bit sick of the focus always being on either the fire or frost tree.</div></div><hr />

No. I'm not saying that about arcane. It should be like in wrath where fire and arcane were both good in pve and frost was for pvp. I'm saying that if they had fire and arc doing fine in pve, then frost doesn't need to. There would already be two good specs for pve and a third would not really help anything pve wise other than someone not liking to shoot fire while making an already imbalanced pvp spec even more imbalanced.<br />
<br />
They will probably do something with arcane for pve. But keeping frost good in pve is just making pvp incredibly broken.</div></div><hr />

One of the changes to the frost mastery is that it's going to start out 6% lower than it does now. So depending on the math, it could actually be a nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently, 8% base mana has the spell costing 1393 for me. This makes the following:<br />
<br />
1-stack : 3482<br />
2-stack : 5572<br />
3-stack : 7661<br />
4-stack : 9751<br />
<br />
With 7% base mana, we're looking at 1213, which has the following:<br />
<br />
1-stack : 3032<br />
2-stack : 4852<br />
3-stack : 6671<br />
4-stack : 8491<br />
<br />
I have been finding that I can slide a 3AB/(ABr|AM), even very safe 4AB rotations with CC procs, more often as gear increases. With this change, the mana required for a 3AB rotation drops from 10447 to 9097, which is 1350 mana. I'm personally excited to see the rotation implications of the mana conserved by this change alone. With a 2AB rotation, in order to minimalize delay between spells, if you don't proc AM on the first AB, you use ABr to clear after the 2nd. If AM procs on the 2nd, you can use it on the next series, but that's an additional 2090 mana used to clear AB stacks without much, if any, DPS gain.<br />
<br />
On the contrary, if you use a 3AB rotation more for base, that's a 64% chance to proc AM to be used instead of a 40% chance. The mana conserved could be used to bump up the rotation closer to 4AB, which provides even more opportunity to proc AM instead of using ABr to clear.<br />
<br />
In short, don't look at 1% and think &quot;waaaah, not enough&quot;.</div></div><hr />

New Skill - Sacred Shield (Rank 4) *New* - When reduced below 30% health, you gain the Sacred Shield effect. The Sacred Shield absorbs [1 + 2.8 * AP] damage and increases healing received by 20%. Lasts 15 sec. This effect cannot occur more than once every 30 sec. 30 sec cooldown.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Till</div><div class="date">2011-01-11, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 things:<br />
<br />
First, Mages. I think its neither a nerf or a buff. They loose 6 Mastery with the new Frostburn (5% increased damage instead of 20%), and they gain 15% damage in Ice Lance through Fingers of Frost and a straight 15% damage to Frostbolt. So, basically, the numbers will remain the same. Its just that Mages will qq for nerfing their Mastery, while all other will qq for buffing Ice Lance...<br />
<br />
Second, Hunters. I play a SV Hunter myself, and I must say that the way things are going, MM is going to be the only decent option for PvP. Hunters are already crap in PvP right now, and SV is the best spec we have to be able to perform in BGs, although we are far behind almost every other class. By nerfing Black Arrow, Blizz is just sending the spec to oblivion PvP wise. If you check the Arena Ladder, you will see that every Hunter in the top 100 (must be only 4-6 in every battlegroup) that plays SV, doesn't even bother to take the talent (we are talking about the 31-point talent, the &quot;signature&quot; of the tree), because it is getting dispelled immediately, and the damn thing cost 1/3 of our focus. They rely solely on Explosive Shot to do some burst. And here comes Blizz and nerfs Explosive Shot also! Have in mind that Explosive Shot is a luckluster shot compared to other main dps abilities of other classes that can easily crit for more that 20K damage in 3K resilience targets... A SV Hunter, if he is lucky enough to have all 3 ticks of Explosive Shot crit (and with around 22% crit chance its nearly impossible to have all 3 of them crit), he may see a rough 16-18K damage total on a 3K resilience cloth target. And ofc Explosive Shot is on a 6 sec CD...</div></div><hr />

How many times have data mined changes corresponded to actual change notes? Again, most of the times. My point still stands.</div></div><hr />

Fingers of Frost now also increases Ice Lance damage by 15%.<br />
Frost Specialization now also increases the damage of Frostbolt by an additional 15%. However, if will decrease your Frostburn mastery by 6.'<br />
Seriously give me a break.. Finger of frost is like on all the time and will improve Ice lance dmg.. that just fucking lame... hope it will change quick after blizzard realize how much mages gonna dominate.. even more now that is..</div></div><hr />

<br />
People having different playstyles is great and all, but it takes a back seat to game balance. If frost does enough damage in pve, then it makes it so that it not only has insane control in pvp, but insane dmg. You're asking for an aesthetic quality of life change that will adversely affect pvp balance a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
is this patch going live on April 1st?<br />
<br />
It seems to me that Blizzard is trying to compensate for their ranged-based encounters by buffing the snot out of melee classes. Wrong way to go. Re-do your encounter design, and make sure that the dps that can actually do its job this tier can do that job well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe the changes are an attempt to balance stat values for combat better. Currently mastery is absolute trash, and with so much of the current level of gear being focused on mastery, that's very bad for combat.<br />
<br />
Also, Combat and Assassination have been going back and forth for the last 2 years... this is certainly not a 'for once Assassination is on top' situation, since Assassination has been on top multiple times since the release of WotLK.</div></div><hr />

thats good, because 40 exalted repuations is what rewards &quot;The Exalted&quot; title, although there is an achievement for 45 exalted reps... it's 40 where you get the title !<br />

<br />
Nerfing Black Arrow makes so little sense. That thing barely does more damage than a Fire Trap and that's because you can simply trap launch it after a WS or something, besides costing considerably less focus (or none at all if you don't launch it).<br />
<br />
Nerfing AoE AND single target capabilities of Survival on top of their base capabilities (reduced agility talent passive) to the ground seems their way to go, instead of buffing the other hunter trees. Better make sure they're all underpowered instead of looking for a middle ground.<br />
<br />
Nah, Blizzard prefers to nerf the spec that pulls ahead of everyone else.<br />
<br />
But maybe that doesn't make sense to you.</div></div><hr />

We rule, you're a nerd, deal with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Archaeology... Finally, after so many downs, one up. BoA items that are useful for only hours were horrible. The Azshara Gown was even worse, because takes the 10% experience bonus from Heirlooms. Keep the sensitivity that way, good call.<br />
<br />
Now... Serpent Spread... That was really necessary? I can see it might be bothering in PvP, but really, people turtling that way might just deserve the 9 seconds.<br />

Well, Feral Druids seem a VERY LITTLE better in tunning, but the numbers still sliding more far than the should.<br />

Frost mages... Really? No nerfs? I understand they're warrior counters but their damage is pretty sick and now that ice lance is getting buffed, I've come to the conclusion blizz is in love with mages, probably should of known this a while ago.<br />
