<br />
The Flamestrike style racial is subject to diminish returns per target hit because it's an AoE. It has a long CD. It has a long gap between activation and impact.<br />
<br />
The Explode When You Die is laughable. If you're a tank and you die the heal and damage are unlikely to make an impact as far as saving the rest of your frontliners. If you're a healer and you die you probably aren't standing with anyone for your explosion to make a difference. Same if you're a ranged DPS. I GUESS this could be okay in some kind of arena cleave comp but that's reeaaaally stretching to find a use for it.<br />
<br />
+XP for killing demons is obviously useless once leveled and is way too situational to be worth a damn in most cases anyways.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing. Woo? Summoning the forge is kind of novel, but that's it. That's the best racial. Absolute garbage. It's a shame because these guys look super cool but the baseline Draenei outclass the Lightforged in absolutely every way.</div></div><hr />

Racials are not supposed to be something that will save the entirety of your raid, you know.<br />

That's the same as saying that Touch of the Grave should represent 25% of any undead's DPS.</div></div><hr />

I agree with Puppet that their racials are realllly underwhelming right now, but fortunately for me I'm a filthy casual these days so min\maxing racial bonuses isn't all that important to me anymore.<br />

<br />
If Light's Judgement hits as hard as the current Light's Judgement ability that could end up pretty strong. Considering all other races get a 1% damage boost from somwhere and these guys lack it they could well have decided to roll all that power into a single long cooldown ability to make it hit pretty hard. The delay before it goes off also suggests it hits hard and they wan't to prevent it being too cheesy in PvP.<br />
<br />
Also, worth mentioning, the existing Drenai racials are pretty bad, it's scant praise at best but by comparison these are ok.</div></div><hr />

Wtb ally allied race that can be a druid please and thanks.<br />

E: Kind of weird these draenei can't be shaman. Guess it's just Dark Iron for a new shaman race. :l</div></div><hr />

In the end we will probably end up playing a lightforged draenei but please improve the facial customizations for all races seriously.

One thing i miss about the pre-WoD character models are definitely the noticeable and distinguishable differences in the faces.</div></div><hr />

No. The tail geoset is there (the standard draenei females also have it since the model revamp in WoD), but the option was never added to the game.<br />
<br />
Sucks, I know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Demonbane - Experience gains from killing demons increased by 20%.<br />
GG<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly the rest seem meh as well. The light's judgement obstacle would make it possible to become really powerfull in pve because it's a too big obstacle for pvp.<br />
The Light's Reckoning, is too bad and to class specific. It would need to be like Kogmaw in LoL where you can still run for a while after death and on explosion deal like 30% damage on the players hit (or because it also has light's judgement 20% minimum). <br />
<br />
The heritage armour looks cool and combined with that has some nice astetics. But it's cheesy as hell for first allied race batch, draenei with a bit of light when their already light themed. (same with void elves, who look a lot like Night Elves or Blood Elf DK's)</div></div><hr />

Why do the heritage set pics show regular Draenei though? Just an mmochamp oversight?<br />
<br />
That is actually a lightforged draenei..æ. oh, so lucky we are to get a race we mistake for normal draenei when seeing them.<br />
<br />
Edit: you have to click on the modellviewer to see lightforged in the armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the same as saying that Touch of the Grave should represent 25% of any undead's DPS.<br />
<br />
No it isn't.<br />
<br />
Touch of the Grave is useful. Lets say you're a Lightforged Marks Hunter and a raid mechanic kills you and your racial triggers but you're spread out because raid mechanics sometimes demand this -- your explosion doesn't heal any allies and it doesn't harm any enemies.<br />
<br />
You could have had Dwarven critical strike bonus damage. You could have had Gnome haste. You could have had Night Elf Haste or Crit. You could have had regular Draenei's AGI boost. You could have had Worgen's +Crit. You could have gone with Void Elf's 5% extra damage proc.<br />
<br />
Instead you went with Zero Damage Or Healing When You Die Alone and you have no throughout racial.<br />
<br />
Not all racials have to be good in all situations. The explode could be a fun flavor racial, but there isn't any other saving grace here. You weren't even willing to contest anything else on the list -- just the dumb explode one. It's bad in organized PVE. It's bad for PVP. It's useless for solo questing.</div></div><hr />

It just feels like Blizzard yet again reskinning some old models and presenting it as &quot;new and improved&quot;, and then hiding it behind a &quot;you need to do all this shit to get access to them&quot; wall. There's just something about working hard to unlock nothing more than a skincolor-variation that feels underwhelming. <br />

Disappointed in the lack of leather class, sure draenei had monk given to them in pandaria but just felt like this could be a change like a light-forged infiltrator (rogue), and since suramar elves can be monks dunno why these can't. <br />
Racials aren't that great but its never a deciding factor for me when choosing a race.</div></div><hr />

Though I have to admit it would be hilarious to see a Draenei nuke in World PvP, where you'd get like 40 Draenei mounted in the air, all dropping simultaneously to their deaths in the middle a large group of the opposing faction.<br />

If LFD were released today the skill would need to do something like 3 million damage per activation just to keep par with the various measly 1% racials other races get. Possibly more given its clunky usability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Flamestrike style racial is subject to diminish returns per target hit because it's an AoE. It has a long CD. It has a long gap between activation and impact.<br />
<br />
The Explode When You Die is laughable. If you're a tank and you die the heal and damage are unlikely to make an impact as far as saving the rest of your frontliners. If you're a healer and you die you probably aren't standing with anyone for your explosion to make a difference. Same if you're a ranged DPS. I GUESS this could be okay in some kind of arena cleave comp but that's reeaaaally stretching to find a use for it.<br />
<br />
+XP for killing demons is obviously useless once leveled and is way too situational to be worth a damn in most cases anyways.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing. Woo? Summoning the forge is kind of novel, but that's it. That's the best racial. Absolute garbage. It's a shame because these guys look super cool but the baseline Draenei outclass the Lightforged in absolutely every way.<br />
<br />
<br />
I fully agree with this, they could atleast have given some baseline stat like all the other races, such as 1% extra versitility or whatever, they get nothing like this, and yet the activatable is something that will be extremly easy to avoid in pvp, to make it viable it has to either make a rediculus ammount of damage or it should take less time to charge up.<br />
<br />
the blow up on death will probably only make a dent in pvp, but even then, why would you pick a char that has a suicidal perk like that. though it could potentially make a more suicial approach in pvp work, as other players might be afraid to kill you while you stand near, as a melee class...<br />
<br />
void elfs get no delay in cast time, and a ffing 40 yard teleport...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides that, the lightforged draenei are clearly a big upgrade from the normal draenei. <br />
<br />
I think that now people will only roll normal draenei instead of these new ones only because of the shaman class that isn't available for the LFD.</div></div><hr />
