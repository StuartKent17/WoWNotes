Nice to see enchanters be able to make some money from their profession without needing to sit on the AH bridge and say 'LOL IM ENCHANTING', wasting time when they could be doing dailies to earn more money.<br />
<br />
Edit: It might be worth adding to your post that Unrelenting Blade, as seen in the screenshot, is Bind on Equip.</div></div><hr />

<br />
spellpower is the new word with wotlk. spellpower will be &quot;transformed&quot; into +heal or +spelldmg depending on your skill or talentbuild. (dunno exactly how it will work, sry)<br />

The levelling XP needed for each level from 60 to 70 has been reduced by about 30%, I don't think quest XP has increased though.<br />
<br />
This should make re-levelling somewhat more bearable and less painful.</div></div><hr />

It's already been confirmed that Blacksmiths will be able to add 2 gem slots to a weapon. The same thing with armor seems fairly likely to occur.</div></div><hr />

Except they redid them to look virtually identical to their original form. There was some note along the way that they did this to help with loading or something. I doubt you'll ever see them actually make noticeable improvement on the existing playable models as a lot of people would get all up in arms about them changing the way their character looks.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that enchanters will really mind this, because it still means that they can sell enchants even if they need to have someone else make the scrolls for them to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it is hitrating so at the level 80 your 40 hitrating means 1 % hit. So nothing new, i think.</div></div><hr />

It'll also enable enchanters to level without either :<br />
- enchanting the same item several times over<br />
- enchanting for free and waiting for people to need something to be enchanted<br />
Which are both money or time sinks.<br />
<br />
(though i doubt levelling enchants will sell that well, it'll still be a potential gain)<br />
<br />
Edit : that is, if inscribers can produce the required scrolls rapidly :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a big difference between Armor &amp; Weapons.<br />
As a warrior or a rogue you put your maexxna dagger or your ashbringer into the bank and pick up a lvl68 blue weapon with more dps. The PreBC Armor for example T3 was so good that you upgraded it with Gear from Karazhan on lvl70 and sometimes just for the gem slots...<br />
<br />
So i am sure that we will keep our T6 / Sunwell Loot until we get better items in Naxxramas Reloaded!!<br />

<br />
The rest of the pieces aren't as good because of either the t6 set bonus, and sockets.<br />
<br />
And the only two ranged weapons shown so far are an 83 dps gun, and a 92 dps bow. BBS ftw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
that would be a change in the mechanics, because you need exact the same hitrating at lvl 80 vs lvl 83 bosses as with lvl 70 vs 73. +3 lvls = +15def compared to the own expertise rating. or am i wrong?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You're not blind, but there are str/x on other gems so I think it has just been left out. Also note there are no blue gems on there. :D</div></div><hr />

Rating stats degrade as you level, so when you ding 71 your crit, hit, and other rating stats will benefit you less. Also for example Agility will give physical dps classes less crit as you level as well. Otherwise hunters would quickly be at 60+% crit just from agility.<br />
<br />
You'll need the exact same +hit% but you'll need a fair amount more Hit rating to hit that percentage at 80.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If by rogue you mean +haste gems, then yes. I doubt any caster will be going for agi/hit gems, however :P Maybe haste/hit (if there is such a thing!)</div></div><hr />

I wonder if it's a multi-player mount? Engineer's second crafted mount? I hope so!</div></div><hr />

Well by the way you think it works you would need that much hit rating on a level 5 to hit a level 8. Just think about it like that and its easy to see the amount you need changes as you level.</div></div><hr />

I love the motorcycle, and unfortunately I'm not an engineer, and I think it is the second engineer's mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Steam Tanks didn't set you off? Rocket Mounts? Mechano-Striders? Spacegoats? Sentient all powerful life forms made of light and energy didn't get you going? Really, of all things, Motorcycles? Are we nit-picking now.<br />
all the above things ok but seriously Motorcycles? :-[ bit lame tbh surely blizz could have come up with a more fitting fantasy type of passenger type mount i dunno a wingless dragon or something hell even a madmax style dune buggy would be more viable imho</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snitchers</div><div class="date">2008-07-22, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Crit rating is universal now for all classes afaik. Works both for spell and melee crit.<br />
<br />
On the other hand this would be quite silly for casters to run around with 15% melee crit, so i suppose they have some sort of workaround for that.</div></div><hr />
