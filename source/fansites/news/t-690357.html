Just wanted to update players on the hotfixes that have been applied recently to Icecrown Citadel...<br />
<br />
Blood Prince Council<br />
<br />
Prince Keleseth will no longer melee players. So if you get knocked into Keleseth or happen to move by him, he won't swipe in between his casts and kill a non-tank.<br />
<br />
The first Shadow Resonance should appear earlier in the fight, which will allow the Keleseth tank to have more orbs on him or her if Keleseth is empowered second instead of third. We didn't want which Blood Prince was empowered second to be a major element of the difficulty in the fight.<br />
<br />
We reduced the melee damage for the Princes by 10% for the 10 player difficulty. They were doing less damage than the 25 player before the hotfix, but this change lowers the damage further.<br />
<br />
Empowered Flames will now run out of power after shooting fewer firebolts in the 10 player difficulty. We did not change the initial impact damage.<br />
<br />
Blood-Queen Lana'thel<br />
<br />
The Blood-Queen is no longer spawned until the Blood Princes dies. This will prevent any unfortunate entry of her highness while a raid is fighting the Blood Princes. The initial hotfix for this causes the Blood-Queen to not spawn at all in a particular circumstance, but this was also fixed last night.<br />
<br />
We increased the duration of Essence of the Blood Queen to 60 seconds in 25 player difficulty, and 75 seconds in 10 player difficulty. A strategy developed for managing the Essences throughout the fight that involved intentionally killing a player, and this change addresses that strategy. The new timing does interact with some of her other abilities in new ways, but there are methods that players have to lessen that impact.</div></div><hr />

Yes, Blood Prince Council was hard for us but it was a fun fight that required a lot of skill and co-ordination. It was the only encounter in current content that I have found difficult to heal and rewarding to overcome. <br />
<br />
We are neither overgeared nor hard core. We raid for approximately 6-9 hours in a week. These nerfs are not needed. The encounter should have been left as it is for at least until the next gate is open.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our under-geared resto shaman (Jayr) healed our Warlock Tank. There have been reports of this being tanked by many classes. It should not be so hard that your 10m cannot field a Warlock/Mage/Paladin/Death Knight in order to tank this.<br />
<br />
The orb spawn fix was definitely justified however it should have been held until Tuesday to leave the entire week fair for progression sake.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you, but I find the heroic modes to be hard enough. The difference between the hardest easy mode boss and the easiest heroic mode boss is just too big a gulf. There's too many guilds with varying skill levels essentially occupying the same space progression-wise, where they're facerolling normal mode but can't do or can barely do anything in heroic mode.</div></div><hr />

Im guessing you didn't even read what the news post was about. It is funny how people who say the game is so easy never have any armory links or ways for people to actually see what they have or have not done. If you think the game is so easy post an armory link. Lets see your Blood Queen Kill, lets see your TOGC clear or an Algalon kill. I'm guessing you have none of these and are jealous of those who do, so you put down the game to diminish your shame.</div></div><hr />

that's why they're called hotfixes. They're meant to fix things blizz didn't intend to happen, and don't want to CONTINUE happening. They only nerf things when they're unneccesarily hard to a point where their fan base gets unhappy rather than feel comfortably challenged</div></div><hr />

Why the Playstation as a time indicator may be wrong, this statement holds true. Modern games are more about watching than playing.<br />
<br />
Apart from that modern trend WoW is only bearable because the multiplayer factor multiplies the game experience way beyond most good single player games.</div></div><hr />

it was only creative for the people who came up with it. now you jsut read MMO champ and copy their strat. that isn't creativity. the people who originally thought of it did get rewarded -- they got an easy first kill. there's no real reason you should benefit from it.</div></div><hr />

The council indeed was challenging. As we were lacking ranged, I was the range tank as an ele shaman (horrible 25 yard shocks). We did wipe a couple of times, mostly due to my personal fail &quot;Melee swing hits for ~90k *fail*&quot;<br />
<br />
It took us ~10 wipes to get the fight under control, and it felt really rewarding when we got the kill. It is totally possible to have 3 orbs on you when the ranged mob empowers 2nd. If the orbs spawns were horrible we had a dps kiting it towards me and we always popped a cd when my mob empowered.<br />
<br />
I think it is a pitty that blizzard is that fast on nerfing content. Let guilds progress on those bosses for a bit. Wiping a few nights is part of the job. It is perfectly fine to have guilds struggling at different points in ICC. All current fixes on the council remove the harder aspects, which can be worked around by perfecting tactics. Things like a cooldown rotation are part of your tactic. Content will be nerfed anyway as the buff will be introduced after some time.<br />
<br />
The nerf on bloodqueen is more justified. It is very doable if you're decked out in totgc10 gear, I can imagine it is too hard if you are on a lowe gearlvl.<br />
<br />
One last thought, rather radical: Why should a 232 geared guild be able to clear content in the first week when they will be rewarded by gear that is 2 levels higher then their current set?</div></div><hr />

You talk about nerfs, even though there were only 1 nerf.<br />
And that nerf was the 10% reduction in Melee damage on the Princes, but otherwise there was no nerfs at all.<br />
Everything else was justified, you shouldn't be dependant on RNG mechanics and planned player death to beat a boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;- Prince Keleseth will no longer melee players. So if you get knocked into Keleseth or happen to move by him, he won't swipe in between his casts and kill a non-tank.<br />
- The first Shadow Resonance should appear earlier in the fight, which will allow the Keleseth tank to have more orbs on him or her if Keleseth is empowered second instead of third. We didn't want which Blood Prince was empowered second to be a major element of the difficulty in the fight.<br />
- We reduced the melee damage for the Princes by 10% for the 10 player difficulty. They were doing less damage than the 25 player before the hotfix, but this change lowers the damage further.<br />
- Empowered Flames will now run out of power after shooting fewer firebolts in the 10 player difficulty. We did not change the initial impact damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
I am mainly talking about the council. The nerf on the Queen is acceptable, though I believe they should've let the MC persist through death like Yog. Queen is a tight dps race, but I'm pretty sure most guilds who don't have the kill yet could've improved a lot before a nerf should be added.<br />
<br />
All of the changes to the councel are nerfs in some way. In our ~10 attempts we did not have a single meleed dead besides me as ranged tank. But this was completely my own fail, if one thing should be fixed it's the pathing of the mobs! Gathering orbs is also doable with some assistance when the spawn is not good, popping cds on your most squishy tanks is nothing more than logic on a challenging fight where tank death is possible. Last, if the raid is positioned correctly and everybody reacts properly when the orb spawns the amount of flares was fine.<br />
<br />

I agreed with that.<br />
But when bad RNG means that your tank is gonna get instant killed, and then this Prince goes on killing off the rest of the raid, then it's to much.<br />

<br />
Because it comes with a penalty when you let some one die on Saurfang, he heals himself for a good chunk of health, and increases his Blood Power regeneration(I'm not sure if this is when he casts The Mark of the Fallen Champion, or when some one dies from it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Your healers are a resto shaman and two trees. Your ranged tank is a mage. You don't have holy paladins or disc priests available, nor a warlock to tank. (Bring the player, not the class, particularly in 10-man.) Who pops what cooldowns on the mage to get him to survive 30k shadow lances when only 3 orbs have even spawned by the time the empower moves to Keleseth?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Our under-geared resto shaman (Jayr) healed our Warlock Tank. There have been reports of this being tanked by many classes. It should not be so hard that your 10m cannot field a Warlock/Mage/Paladin/Death Knight in order to tank this.<br />
<br />
The orb spawn fix was definitely justified however it should have been held until Tuesday to leave the entire week fair for progression sake.<br />
<br />
<br />
A warlock takes 24k from a 30k shadow lance just from Soul Link, and other talents help reduce them even further.<br />
<br />
There aren't limited attempts on Council, so there's no reason not to nerf it mid-week at all. Changing limited attempts bosses mid-week is more questionable.</div></div><hr />

That indeed is bad RNG, but I wonder how this could happen in the first place. I have not seen it happen in any of our attempts or kill. Does the tank die due to the ranged mob melee'ing or other combined dmg sources? In case of the ranged mob melee'ing:<br />
<br />
a) The ranged tank ran through the raid, which is dangerous as you know the prince could 1 shot people. Though this is a problem in combination with the slow spawning orbs at the start of the fight when the ranged mob empowers second.<br />
b) the tank got blown away because an orb hit the floor, this only happens when the people that are assigned to these orbs are not performing their job good enough.<br />
c) The tank gets hit by a vortex, I'm not sure if they can spawn in melee. If yes, that one is random.<br />
<br />
I did not observe any unavoidable RNG wipes, it might be there is more to it. But I'm pretty convinced there is barely any random that can't be avoided. On the other hand, with a boss with so many different abilities going on at the same time I'm not that surprised if a strange combination of abilities wipes a raid every now and then. We had one &quot;RNG&quot; wipe happening too.<br />
<br />
One of my first wipes was unlucky, we had a orb hitting the floor. Our Taldarom feral tank got knock backed and then an empowered flame targetted our tank who was ranged at that moment. After the knock back he immediately charged back in and therefore blew up all the melee. A random wipe, but it could've been prevented if everything was executed properly.</div></div><hr />

Your ranged tank is a mage. You don't have holy paladins or disc priests available, nor a warlock to tank. (Bring the player, not the class, particularly in 10-man.) Who pops what cooldowns on the mage to get him to survive 30k shadow lances when only 3 orbs have even spawned by the time the empower moves to Keleseth?<br />
<br />
This encounter requires a ranged tank, thus you should bring one along. You're presenting a worst case scenario, which is not very likely as I've not seen many guilds without any ranged but a mage. I've even heard there are guilds with a dk tanking the ranged one. If there's no other option, you could ask your mage to spec frost for ice barrier or prismatic cloak in arcane. This is not a perfect solution, but in your worst case scenario you should be willing to do everything to improve your chances on a kill.<br />
<br />
That healing set up indeed is a problem, but your guild would've encountered a problem with the lack of cooldown in several fights before this one. Mimiron, Vezax for example. Back then it didn't ring a bell?<br />
<br />
The encounter should be designed to be challenging, therefore to some extend you have to field a decent set up to take on the challenge. If you insist on making it through every encounter with the worst set up possible, be creative. I can think of some other optioins; if you have a paladin (or is this also lacking in your worst case scenario?) he can HoS the mage, there goes 9k inc dmg! I'm pretty sure there are more creative options people can think of.<br />
<br />
Progressing on a new boss is more than checking the tankspot movie and reading abilities on wowhead.<br />
<br />
If you insist on beating every encounter with a worst case scenario, you are going to have a hard time in the upcomming fights. You might want to spend some effort in creating a raid group with some synergy. Or are you thinking that everybody should be able to complete the hardest raid instance in the WotLK?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was thinking about the Keleseth Tank, which would maybe a Warlock or Mage or something. Will this Clothie survive a 60k melee hit from Keleseth? I doubt it.<br />
ofc, if everything is done correctly, then the ranged tank would never be inside his Melee range, but there is a alot of knockbacks in this fight, so maybe you will be just extremely unlucky, and your range tanks get thrown into his melee range.<br />
That is not a good RNG mechanic, random events like that should never cause a possible wipe, only make your raiders think outside the box.<br />
There is a couple of these things happening to me when i was raiding, one that pop into my mind is on Ignis 25 man.<br />
I was assigned to kill adds when they go into the water, but i was picked up and thrown into his Hot Pocket as one was dragged into the water on my side, which resulting in that i chouldn't get to it in time, and then the tanks had to do it all over again.<br />
We still killed him, but it caused the fight to be sligtly harder.<br />
RNG caused this, but it didn't prevent us from finish the fight.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghengie</div><div class="date">2010-01-23, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you could've stated on ventrilo/TS that you were in the hot pocket. If you are in an organized guild, another dps will pick it up and kill the add. It's random, but easily worked around.<br />
<br />
We both have Keleseth in our mind on the other discussion. Correct, the tank should not get hit fo 60k. I did get killed a few times because I ran through to grab the next orb. Nothing more than a personal fail, I tend to state my personal fail a lot. Probably because it makes the raid feel better when the RL fails every now and then too... <br />
<br />
Back on topic:<br />
There are 2 knock back effects if I'm not terribly mistaken: The orb will only hit the floor if the assigned player fails, the vortex is random indeed. Did the vortex realy cause a melee swing often? My experience is that Keleseth is following on a really short range. It is possible to get knocked into melee range, but this sounds higly unlikely.<br />
<br />
I think the general mechanism for Keleseth was great, the melee swing gave it an extra challenge: gather the orbs, avoid all environment dmg and make sure you stay away from the mob. By removing the melee hit, they removed the challenging part that would cause a wipe when not executed properly. In my opinion it would've been a lot better if they only put in the faster spawn on the first orb, as this is could turn out very hectic when Keleseth empowed second.<br />
<br />
Let those guilds struggle for a bit, a rare random wipe really doesn't hurt. It is a great fight and a kill is a lot more rewarding if you've worked for it. Problem often is that not just the really random wipes are random, lack of understanding of the game mechanics is also a big contributer to the complaints about random.</div></div><hr />

Yes, i chould just have informed over Ventrilo that i chouldn't kill the add, but i didn't.<br />
Essentially what i mean is, you should have some kind of alternative to counter random events.<br />
A random event shouldn't = wipe. It should make unforseen changes to a fight, and make you adapt to it.<br />

We had a DK then tank it and we got it on our 9th overall try. He was able to run up behind melee and grab orbs that I otherwise would have had to portal / run /CoA /run back ( if you got oor of Kelseth he had a knack to run up to you and melee gib you ) So imo even though we beat it and its an easy enough encounter with the right tanks I think the fix is obviously justified since he (the DK) normally is DPS and tops our meters almost every run - his dps surely could have been put to better use downing the bosses and now it can with this hotfix. <br />
<br />
So its not a nurf if you dont want your ranged tank to get 1 shot ( meta/ruin 30k SL /SL tank with shadow ward up )- IDK about 10m but it was a good fix for 25m.</div></div><hr />

On normal mode, in 10-man, yes. I like how just &quot;lacking a paladin or warlock&quot; is &quot;worst case scenario&quot;, though. Very amusing. No fights up until now have REQUIRED one of those two classes. Now one did, before these nerfs. Thus the nerfs. To allow groups who bring the player, not the class, to get past the encounter. It'll still be harder without a holy paladin making tank heals easy mode, but it won't be literally impossible when RNG ganks you with one-shots. Your other examples of fights that required cooldowns to keep tanks up all involved TANK CLASSES TANKING. They have their own cooldowns. This is the first fight to require a HEALER COOLDOWN (i.e. one of two particular classes of healer) just to dodge possible unavoidable wipes before these nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well priests could tank it (shadow) and use healing cooldowns (disc/holy). DK's I believe also have cooldowns which could get you past an early empowerment without 3 orbs (which are quite easy to get anyway, especially if you have people ferry them to you if they get aggro). So most of your claims in that post are false, sorry to say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A Timb111 already states, your claims are false. The examples I stated used healer cooldowns to survive burst phases. Atleast, we did when we were learning the fight. You make me laugh by swapping your worst case scenario around to &quot;not having a paladin or warlock&quot; this time. By now your set up looks like: 2x Resto Druid, 1x Resto Shaman, 1x Mage and NO Boomkin, Warlock, Hunter, Elemental Shaman, Paladin in any spec. I'm going to stop arguing with your as there is no way I can counter your &quot;ow, then that class isn't in my set up either&quot; argument.<br />
<br />
Bring 10 druids or paladins along next time. It might actually be a fight where this is viable.<br />
<br />
The only problem I agree with the encounter was the problem with gathering enough orbs an early empower.</div></div><hr />

Cataclysm Ammo Changes<br />
We haven't announced the Cataclysm ammo change yet, except to say that it will no longer be a consumable.<br />
<br />
The simplest solution is certainly that ammo goes away and guns, bows and crossbows just don't ever run out of ammo. More complicated features might be more exciting as you say, but have potential downsides too. Applying fire to your arrows sounds cool, but is ultimately any more interesting than just having a &quot;Fire Shot&quot; ability. Do you really conceive of a lot of situations where you'd rather do Fire damage over physical damage? Having different kinds of arrows sounds interesting until you consider the delivery mechanism of having to &quot;catch them all&quot; through rare drops, badge vendors or the like. As you say, hunters do have a lot of buttons and a pet to manage, so I'm not sure they really need a whole additional mechanic to worry about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I tanked it fine on both 25 and 10 man with less health than you and never got hit for harder than 15-16k. I was highly mobile during the fight and Keleseth never ran up to me and melee'd me, and pulling the nuclei off of the melee dps was trivial, you are a RANGED class. The only &quot;fix&quot; that was justified for Council was the making the Shadow Resonance spawn earlier to provide you with enough orbs. Everything else was just a massive neutering of the fight because there are so many bad/ignorant players in this game.<br />
<br />
It's awesome how one fight that was a refreshing break from the norm by allowing Warlocks/Mages/Hunters/Boomkins to have fun performing a niche role was dumbed down to idiot status because people are terrible at this game. It was fun for a week I guess.<br />

Which was exactly the problem for our 10-man (druid/warrior tanks, 2x mages, 2x rogues, fury warrior, resto shaman, 2x trees) that had no issues with any previous normal-mode fights. The exact problem I was saying these nerfs fixed, which you would rather claim my group makeup is bad than that the encounter design was broken, when no other encounter has had issues with that exact same group makeup. I'm not using 10 druids or 10 paladins, but go ahead and slippery slope your arguments, it's really win.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghengie</div><div class="date">2010-01-26, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard is creating more buff overlap to increase freedom in our set up, but this does not mean you can take whatever set up you want. You will still need some basic abilities in your raid.<br />
Blizzard stated that they balance encounters around certain buffs, which you are lacking; fortitude, kings, MoTW and replenishment. The first 3 are no real problem due to the scrolls, but your mana users should be feeling the lack of replenishment.<br />
<br />
If blizzard is expecting us to have a replenishment (currently viable on spriests, locks, retridins and to a lesser extend hunters) then they surely can expect us to have any of the viable ranged tanking classes and/or protective cooldowns along? The chance you'll have one of those is a lot bigger than having a replenishment (and Blizzard expects us to have it).<br />
<br />
I can understand the nerf to the orbs spawn, but with a decent set up it already was far from impossible. I still wonder why the other aspects of the fights had to be changed that soon after the release.<br />
<br />
A side note on raid set ups. I assume your guild will want to progress through the whole if ICC (including HM's?). This is the end game raid. By not fielding a set up with a base amount of synergy, you are holding your guild back. I fear that you will end up with more issues, which could be solved easily by minor adjustments in your set up.</div></div><hr />
