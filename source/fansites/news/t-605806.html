2.4 getting closer and closer<br />
Another interesting post by Tigerclaw, it's definitely too late to fix anything that isn't urgent in the 2.4 patch. We probably won't see it this week but we're definitely very close to a release.<br />
It might be easier all around if we just fixed the bug, which is being worked on right now. However I should point out that due to the stage of 2.4.0 development that we are in, this is more likely to get the nod for fixing in 2.4.2 instead of 2.4.0. If this had come up a couple weeks sooner we would be in a better position to address this in 2.4.0.<br />
<br />
<br />
TTR Connection Issues<br />
If you can't connect to Tournament Test Realms because it's not available in the realm list, you might want to do that.<br />
We are aware of the problems with selecting a realm type, and the issue is being looked at. Until it is fixed you can work around this by going into your wowtest/WTF folder and editing your config.wtf file to contain the line:<br />
<br />
SET realmName &quot;Arena Tournament&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
2v2 queue times and 2.4<br />
A few changes are being made to Arenas to let servers run more 2v2 arena instances and decrease the queue time for them. The good thing is, Blizzard is considering further changes if it's not enough to reduce it effectively.<br />
There is a change in 2.4.0 that will allow the servers to kick up more arena instances in a shorter amount of time, generally lowering the amount of time it will take to get into a game with an equal amount of people queuing. We want to avoid calling this a one time &quot;queue cure&quot; as we're still not entirely certain how the changes will affect queue times under full load. Especially considering the increase in activity we see with any major patch release.<br />
<br />
I think they're guaranteed to have some effect, but if it isn't an adequate impact we'll need to make further adjustments.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cogent connections issues<br />
If your internet provider is routing traffic through Cogent, you might have some problems to connect to World of Warcraft servers. Well it's not going to be fixed anytime soon, because Blizzard can't really do anything about it, it's a problem between TeliaSonera (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeliaSonera) and Cogent (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogent_Communications) and users will probably have to wait until it's solved. <br />
Cogent has decided not to exchange traffic directly with TeliaSonera’s AS 1299 or indirectly with AS 1299 through a third-party provider. As a result, Cogent has partitioned the Internet and disrupted the flow of traffic between Cogent and TeliaSonera customers. While this has a negative impact on some users of the Internet, this effect is the result of Cogent’s decision and is unfortunately beyond TeliaSonera’s control.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I remember reading a post on their versioning scheme where they said that the X.x.1 releases were reserved for stuff that had to be fixed due to bugs in the X.x.0 release. As in, like, game-breaking stuff that couldn't wait for the normal development cycle. If there isn't anything like that in the X.x.0 release, the next build will be a X.x.2 release.</div></div><hr />

There was a 2.3.1. It was just bugfixes.</div></div><hr />

The Telia-Cogent Spat Could Ruin the Web For Many <br />
Om Malik, Friday, March 14, 2008 at 2:02 PM PT Comments (66)<br />
<br />
Updated: Swedish telecom operator Telia and U.S.-based connectivity provider Cogent Communications have gotten into an ugly spat and have stopped interconnecting, according to some of my sources in the telecom business. What this essentially means is that Telia&#8217;s DSL customers could have trouble seeing Cogent-connected web services. Telia, now part of TeliaSonera is one of the largest networks in Europe.<br />
<br />
The bickering could be because one of the two parties feel they need to be paid for the traffic they are sending. I am looking into this and have emails out to all my sources in the bandwidth business, and will update accordingly. (If you have any information, drop me a line.)<br />
<br />
Cogent had previously gotten into a slugfest with Level 3 Communications. Cogent&#8217;s stance towards Telia is hypocritical. Here is a press release they issued back in 2005 when complaining about Level3. As a reader points out, Cogent has been involved in such spats with other carriers as well. OpenTransit (France Telecom), Teleglobe, ATDN are some of those who have had Cogent issues.<br />
<br />
This is a letter Telia sent to its customers:<br />
Dear Customer,<br />
We would like to give you the following information:<br />
Cogent has decided not to exchange traffic directly with TeliaSonera&#8217;s AS 1299 or indirectly with AS 1299 through a third-party provider. As a result, Cogent has partitioned the Internet and disrupted the flow of traffic between Cogent and TeliaSonera customers.<br />
While this has a negative impact on some users of the Internet, this effect is the result of Cogent&#8217;s decision and is unfortunately beyond TeliaSonera&#8217;s control. Until Cogent rectifies this situation, TeliaSonera customers experiencing any difficulty reaching Cogent&#8217;s network can continue to purchase IP Transit from TeliaSonera along with another Tier 1 provider. This will fix the immediate problem and ensure optimal connectivity going forward.<br />
We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused&#8230;<br />
If you have further concerns, please address your commercial contact at TeliaSonera</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
not sure if this was already mentioned, probably was, but .odd releases are bug fixes or actually game-engine type changes while .even are used for content releases, class changes, etc...<br />
<br />
so from all the bugs we will get from 2.4.0 there will be a 2.4.1 attempting to fix some/most/all of those bugs. then we will have a 2.4.2 patch release, most likely fixing the imbalance created in 2.4.0, and then a 2.4.3 bug fix release to deal with leftover bugs from 2.4.0 and new bugs created by the 2.4.2 patch release, although they may have just compounded bugs created in 2.4.0 that were not not solved in 2.4.1.<br />
<br />
cynical enough for you?</div></div><hr />
