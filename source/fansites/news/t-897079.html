With 4.2, we’re introducing the new World of Warcraft Dungeon Journal. The feature is currently deep in development, so while we don't have anything to show off just yet, we’ve put together a FAQ with a bit of information. Please enjoy!<br />
<br />
Q: What is the Dungeon Journal?<br />
<br />
A: The Dungeon Journal is a new piece of UI in World of Warcraft that players can use to find out more about specific dungeons, and the bosses within those dungeons, including what abilities they have and the rewards they offer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: How will I access it?<br />
<br />
A: While in a dungeon, hitting &quot;M&quot; (the default key for Map) will open the Dungeon Journal. A new button will also be available in the navigation tray. The Dungeon Journal can be accessed from anywhere - in a dungeon, in a raid, on a boat, etc. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will I have to experience a dungeon or encounter in order to see the associated Dungeon Journal content?<br />
<br />
A: There won’t be any &quot;gating&quot; or limitations placed on what content a player can see in the Dungeon Journal. All boss/dungeon/raid information will be available to all players regardless of level, gear, or content experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What will it show me?<br />
<br />
A: The dungeon/raid map will display the locations of each boss in their respective locations, marked by unique icons.<br />
Players can access boss information by clicking on boss icons on the map, or by clicking on the boss’ name in the associated tab of the dungeon/raid map page.<br />
<br />
General loot information for the dungeon/raid can also be accessed from the dungeon/raid main page by clicking on the Loot tab. This will show all loot dropped - from bosses and trash - in the instance, of a certain quality.<br />
<br />
Boss abilities will be available via the boss’ page, either by clicking on the map or by going through the Dungeon tab. The Dungeon tab on the boss’ page will list out all major spells, abilities, and phases for that fight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are the descriptions going to be simplified or detailed?<br />
<br />
A: Descriptions will be verbose and complete. Our goal is to give a lot of context to the abilities in terms of how they’ll play out; however, we will not be giving any strategy tips in the Dungeon Journal. For example, while the Dungeon Journal might say something like &quot;This ability will cause all players in the affected area to take damage,&quot; it won’t say anything explicit like &quot;All players except the tank should stand behind the boss during his Shield phase.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Will this include adds?<br />
<br />
A: Yes. If a boss has adds, like Ascendant Council or Erudaxx, their abilities will be listed, too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What bosses will be included in 4.2?<br />
<br />
A: That's still being determined. We want to include as many as possible and add more as we go along. We'll provide additional information on availability as we progress through the Public Test Realm process.<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll provide a more comprehensive look at the Dungeon Journal, including the interface and examples of the information it provides, as we move closer to the release of 4.2. Have fun storming the castle!</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has done this with a lot of addons over the years. Dungeon maps, questhelper, and as recently as unlocking the player frames.</div></div><hr />

Ascendant Council has more than one monster, which is what they were intended to mean: fights with multiple monsters will have all monster abilities listed.</div></div><hr />

There's always someone that pops up whining when something like this happens.<br />
<br />
1) Most addon authors understand that they're working with an open code for a game that doesn't belong to them.<br />
2) They cannot control someone else 'copying' their project beyond social repercussion in the first place. Especially since [see 1].<br />
3) Internalizing this feature into the game is safer and more stable in the long run for users of the game.</div></div><hr />

atlas loot still has crafted items, pvp items, justice/valor items, reputations and some other stuff i dont remember now. i doubt it will be obsolete just because of the dungeon journal.</div></div><hr />

Nah, just because they can see the abilities doesn't mean they'll understand them. Your average window licking pug will still need to be told what to do.</div></div><hr />

QFT, with ephasis on #1, and to expand on #3 the mod developer no longer has to worry about maintaining as it will automatically be done for them.</div></div><hr />

Thats a myth. Blizzard never even contacted me set aside paying for any source code. But AtlasLoot its under GPL anyway ^^<br />
<br />
I am really looking forward to the Journal feature. The next weeks will show if or how it will affect AtlasLoot. But since we provide a lot more than dungeon loot AtlasLoot will definitely still developed and worked on for a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure they didn't need that source code to built neither equipment manager nor the dungeon journal.<br />
<br />
They borrowed the ideas though.<br />
<br />
As to legal issues, I have a hard time imagining a natural person (i.e. an individual as opposed to a company) winning any civil suit against Blizz. It's a suicide mission, with a possibility of you being sued to cover their 500k dollar legal expenses afterward if you lose.<br />
<br />
Just look at the legal precedents concerning gaming and IP rights... it's all big commercial enterprises... Sony, Nintendo, Accolade, EA...</div></div><hr />

I expect people to have at least read about boss abilities / strats prior to attempting to PuG a raid, of even the use Dungeon Finder. Yes, even for random heroics (which are now slightly old content since we have two tiers of heroics now).<br />
<br />
While its nice that Blizzard is trying to help the people who won't even help themselves. Since those people won't help themselves, most of this addition to the game will be wasted. I fully expect the types that I am talking about in this post will use this new tool... They will use it to look at all of the pretty loot, but I'd put money on those types not bothering to even try to &quot;learn&quot; any of the fights.<br />
<br />
Note: There is a big difference between reading a list of boss abilities, and &quot;understanding&quot; the basics of an encounter.<br />

<br />
just because they didn't come up with the idea doesn't mean it didn't take a lot of work to get it implemented. seriously, most of you guys on here that complain that &quot;blizz stole ideas&quot; have no clue what it takes to make a video game. <br />
<br />
as for adding things in game to remove the need for addons? i think it's an extremely wise choice. not everyone can run them, and they aren't &quot;stealing&quot; them to make more money. it's not like we're going to have to pay more money a month to have the ability to use these new things in game. they don't have to add them. they are doing it to make the game more fun, not to steal from people that created it.<br />
<br />
would you rather run all the addons you need and have to keep your graphics on low just to run them? or do you want to be able to run 25s with 70 frames and all the addons you ever need with graphics on high? <br />
<br />
the people that made the addons don't make a living off of them. most don't even donate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be GREAT GREAT news for me...The less addons you run, the better, imho. Honestly, it shocks me as to why Blizz has never integrated more of the popular add-on features like Omen, Recount/Skada, x-perl (or any other heavy player frame modifier...the ingame options are still TERRIBLE). <br />
<br />
Oh wait, they have a problem with this game being THAT customizable. Also, they probably make a good chunk of their authenticator sales off of ppl that have downloaded bunk addons that are infected w/ keyloggers and got hacked.<br />
<br />
I don't really give a crap what anyone says, the default UI really sucks and the game is missing a few key elements for the UI like they're claiming they're putting in with 4.2 like ATLAS/ATLAS LOOT!!! Honestly, a game with SO many gear options and no coherent ingame listing? bah...</div></div><hr />

You answered your own question there.<br />
<br />
Because gamers actually did a better job developing UI and in-game helpers than Blizz did.<br />
<br />
And now they're carefully taking the ideas of those people and implementing them as crappier version with lots of fanfare and &quot;omg awesome new feature!&quot; stamps, while the community has been doing a better job for years.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't care about this new dungeon journal. Atlasloot doesn't really affect my game performance at all, and I get my tactics information from tankspot which has comprehensive video guides.<br />
<br />
As to explaining tacs to pugs, Ragnaros EU doesn't really have much of them anymore.</div></div><hr />

Will still use Atlasloot though, since there is so much more gear/items to look at in there other than what bosses in dungeons drops. :b</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which addons exactly ?<br />
Anyone with half a brain noticed more than just the boss loot drops in Atlasloot.<br />
Atlas maybe being the only one losing its usefulness due to dungeon mapping.<br />
Ghost:Recon sure maybe was most useful on bosses, but it worked on trash or any other mobs too and kept a record of what CC's, interrupts etc worked and failed.<br />
If you used atlasloot purely for boss drops then sure that could be one less addon to use, but the dungeon journal is covering and exceeding what is only a small part of what the addon offers.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ozma</div><div class="date">2011-05-02, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Atlasloot will still be useful, unless Blizzard also put in PvP vendors, the ability to view tier sets, collections such as tabards, all the legendaries in the game on one screen etc.<br />
<br />
And the tactics on the map is a good idea. Almost everyone uses websites/videos/addons to learn bosses, so I don't see it as &quot;spoon feeding&quot; at all. Blizz have said they won't spell out exactly how to beat a boss, but rather just show the abilities and stuff. Good changes.</div></div><hr />

And now they're carefully taking the ideas of those people and implementing them as crappier version with lots of fanfare and &quot;omg awesome new feature!&quot; stamps, while the community has been doing a better job for years.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't care about this new dungeon journal. Atlasloot doesn't really affect my game performance at all, and I get my tactics information from tankspot which has comprehensive video guides.<br />
<br />
As to explaining tacs to pugs, Ragnaros EU doesn't really have much of them anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but you just don't get it. If Blizzard implements a feature, they need to do it in a way that provides the most benefit to the most players. Developing features that mimic addons that only a fraction of their customers use just isn't good business sense. The entire point of Blizzard's UI team continually developing and advancing interface support for addons is precisely so players can get the nuanced and customized features they want/demand/expect.<br />
<br />
EDIT: One other thing is that you can pretty much count on the Dungeon Journal being open to addons itself. I'm betting AtlasLoot will end up reformatting to run off of the Dungeon Journal to save on coding. The DJ isn't just a feature in itself...there's all the potential addons that could further advance it (and that Blizzard will work to support).</div></div><hr />

there is a difference between reacting in a bad way and just blindly going in and getting rofl pwnd... this is to save your grp a wipe or 2 just getting mindlessly rofl pwnd because you didn't watch a boss strat or because there isn't one posted some where because you're on the edge of content...</div></div><hr />

EDIT: One other thing is that you can pretty much count on the Dungeon Journal being open to addons itself. I'm betting AtlasLoot will end up reformatting to run off of the Dungeon Journal to save on coding. The DJ isn't just a feature in itself...there's all the potential addons that could further advance it (and that Blizzard will work to support).<br />
The new DJ will likely add an entire host of new api the addon authors (for such addons as AL) to use to improve their addons a great deal in function and performance.<br />
Another note is that with the bosses abilities listed, even if some folk cant work out how they're used it means we will likely be able to link those abilities in chat when explaining tactics. No more will we have to say &quot;rogue you need to interupt his heal/aoe etc&quot; which without a spell name is rather vague we can link the ability with name, cast time, possible phases when it's used etc.<br />
I really don't see myself replacing AL because of this (much like i didnt replace SCT, Raid frames, Outfitter) but it will likely enhance AL with better tools to function. The only UI feature that Blizzard has implemented that has successfully replaced an addon for me is the guild calendar.</div></div><hr />

Wait.. you're mad that Blizzard is taking a feature that many players want and currently use on a daily basis and adding it as a default feature to the game so that we don't have to resort to third party addons to access said features?<br />

I really don't get how this Journal was ever needed. A person that's too lazy to find a comprehensive boss tactic on the web won't do well on an encounter even with the Journal<br />
<br />
We already had AtlasLoot which tracks not only boss drops, but dungeon drops, old instance drops, faction rewards, pvp rewards, crafting items.<br />
AtlasLoot consumed next to no resources even on the crappiest machines.<br />

The only people that are really affected by DJ are the ones who are not only very new to the game, but aslo those who have gotten to max level w/o bothering to branch out on any guides or community websites.<br />

How do you figure?<br />
<br />
I for one will still be using AtlasLoot because I often use it to view much more than raid drops.<br />
<br />
And all of us will still be using addons like DBM, recount, grid, MKBT, IceHUD, hotbar modifiers etc.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that most of what Blizz implemented to &quot;replace&quot; addons has been of much lesser quality.<br />

I think I first heard about them making this feature quite a long time ago. When they said it would provide information on encounters, I was rather hoping that was referring to lore information. I would be cool to see a little story behind each boss, particularly since sometimes their presence in a dungeon can be kind of confusing. We never really get to learn about why certain characters are so powerful or why we're killing them.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for this post, you've provided plenty of glaring examples showing just how narrow your perspective of reality is.<br />
<br />
1) The journal means that someone who hasn't played in a month or two doesn't need to go and reread every strat to remember the specifics of a boss fight. He can just look at the abilities in-game and it'll help fill in the blanks. It also means that it will be easier for educated players to instruct uneducated players - mileage may vary, sure, but you're grossly exaggerating your case of &quot;lazy players&quot; sucking.<br />
<br />
2) Implementation of the DJ and it's API means that maintaining AtlasLoot will be much easier, almost guaranteeing it will survive in some form or another for years to come. It's already seen a couple changes, and Atlas itself has also had it's trouble.<br />
<br />
3) Blizzard feels it is their responsibility to provide players with information. They don't agree that every single person that hits max level should rely on external sites and addons in order to play the game even in the most basic capacities. Many of their in-game implementations of addons are intentionally reduced in scope, so as not to swamp less hardcore players in choices/options. More advanced players still have the option of addons...and will use them regardless.<br />
<br />
4) Some of the addons you listed as &quot;essential&quot; simply aren't. Hotbar modifications? Have you even tried playing with macros?</div></div><hr />

does it show all crafting, rep, world event, old world, etc gear? does it have a &quot;wishlist&quot; functionality? no so once again blizz will make the game &quot;heavy&quot; by adding useless crap to it that atlas loot handles w.o a problem. Also with AL i can turn that off when ever i want to not waste system resources. Wont be able to do that with this crap</div></div><hr />

<br />
The very point of being at the edge of content is to get roflpwned and still owned it up getting past learning wipes and getting a kill. Why would you want to save wipes - wiping and learning to overcome a fight is what's fun when you are raiding. Atleast if you're on 'the edge'</div></div><hr />

The Dungeon tab on the boss’ page will list out all major spells, abilities, and phases for that fight.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Then once the player has mastered the art of reading, we will send one of our top developers from Blizzard, and hold his hand whilst he ciontinues through the Dungeon. When the player meets a boss, the Blizzard Developer will be there to offer a comforting shoulder to rest his head on, and if needed, he can ask for as much help as possible in order to defeat the boss. (this includes allowing the player to wet himself slightly if he gets really scared)&quot;<br />

So was I. Now I am running wow without any addons. You know, there is just one problem i´ve encountered with this:<br />
CONSTANT LUA EXCEPTIONS ERRORS in Group and Raidframe. <br />
<br />
So, maybe, just maybe I should start using again my old addons, suffer each patch because blizzard fucked up their lua interpreter again aka &quot;chaning the api without graceful degradation and backward compatibility&quot;, which honestly is ok for a little game studio, but not for a half billion dollar software company. But well, gamers not coders I guess. University degrees seem to be overrated.<br />
<br />
*deep breath*<br />
Ok, thanks for listening, my rant is over, and I actually feeling really better. Who cares, so they can code in modern controlled ways? But they still got a running product with customers, so everything is ok, I guess.</div></div><hr />
