Warlords of Draenor - All Gold Challenge Modes Complete<br />
A group has already completed all of the gold challenge modes (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8899-challenge-warlord-gold) in Warlords of Draenor, rewarding them with challenge mode weapons (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYvvB1CB7GQ) and a nice yeti mount (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8898-challenge-warlord-silver). Congratulations to them! You can see rankings on WoWProgress (http://www.wowprogress.com/challenge_score/), but they combine both Mists of Pandaria and Warlords of Draenor times.<br />

Armory Stats - Siege of Orgrimmar Progression<br />
Before we get too far into Warlords of Draenor, there are a few outstanding requests for some final armory stats. This sample was updated right up until Patch 6.0.2 went live and looks at accounts active from September 1st onwards, which was 2.3 million accounts and 6.8 million characters. We looked at more detailed stats back in May 2014 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3984-Armory-Stats-Siege-of-Orgrimmar-Progression-Blue-Tweets-DLC-439).<br />
<br />
If there are any other final requests that use pre-6.0.2 Mists of Pandaria data please let us know in the comments, as the data will be wiped when new data collection begins in December.<br />

Warlords Launch Update<br />
Since the launch of Warlords of Draenor we’ve seen a large amount of positive reaction to the new content available in the expansion. Players have been enjoying building and managing their own Garrisons and exploring the new world. With many of the new changes that have been implemented over the past couple of days, we’ve seen a marked improvement in realm performance and stability. Thank you again to everyone for your patience while we have worked around the clock to address these issues. <br />
<br />
As we previously posted the realms in Europe, the Americas, and Oceania had rolling restarts to pick up hotfixes to address some gameplay issues. During this time we also further extended the raised maximum realm population in these regions. While the increase in realm population has allowed more players access to the game, we continue to also see realm queues on heavily populated realms.<br />
<br />
To address the queues for these realms we are currently working on expanding the instancing tech we deployed earlier which allowed for additional copies of Draenor. We are currently testing these improvements with the goal of deploying this tech more widely. To ensure the best possible in-game experience for players this implementation will require additional oversight and testing. We will be carefully scrutinizing and adjusting these modifications throughout the day to ensure that we don’t introduce additional stability and performance issues.<br />
<br />
Hourly updates will resume when we have more information on the progress of these changes to share with you. If you use Twitter, we recommend following @BlizzardCS (https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS) and @Warcraft (https://twitter.com/Warcraft) for updates as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Challenge Mode Daily Quest and Seals of Fate<br />
There is no garrison prerequisite. There was a logic error with the Challenge mode quests that could cause the daily randomizer to select an invalid value (and thus leave no quest available for the day), and we have a hotfix in flight to address that issue.<br />
<br />
Also, since I've seen this come up a few times, the currency turn-in quests for the Tempered Seals of Fate that are used for Draenor bonus rolls are not available until the first raid zone, Highmaul, unlocks during the week of December 2. Take your time and enjoy Draenor; no need to worry about having to stockpile bonus rolls ahead of time. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/350166-daily-challenge-mode-need-inn/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15269758283?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
Queues and Character Transfers<br />
Just to answer some of the people who are unhappy with the queues, I don't have any specific answers I can give on Free Character Moves as of yet. I'll repeat what I said in the US forums that we are working to make sure realms are stable and performing well before we do further evaluations on what FCMs would look like should we do them. i.e. Which realms would need them and where would the moves be too, etc. I don't want to promise anything at this time, but we're not unaware of the concerns and frustrations people are experiencing with queues.<br />
<br />
We've seen an increase in performance overall and have many more people playing and able to play than the past couple of days. We realize there are still queues to contend with, but we haven't walked away or called things &quot;done&quot; as of yet. <br />
<br />
Neth, you guys really are not doing much to alleviate any issues. It would be nice if at least one of you would come out and admit your too cheap to pay for the proper hardware to handle the work load and feel like it wont be needed in the long run. Our short term discomfort (until subscriptions fall off after launch) is an acceptable trade off for blizz. Seriously, someone from blizz just come out and admit you guys messed up and this issues will subside once the player base decreases. I bet you would have a lot less upset players if you just told the truth. Being lied to and screwed over is worse than just being screwed over.<br />
There are no lies being perpetrated in regard to the efforts being made on our end to alleviate issues. I know people like to think this is a truth and it seems really odd to cling to that. There is a very high demand by people to play the game. We are making efforts to support that demand in a variety of ways and we've been making great progress. We're still very early in the day today, so we will continue to be watching the effect of these changes once we get into the more populous times for the realms. Seriously. The efforts or the teams on this end are constant and ongoing at all levels. They are incredibly dedicated to doing what they can to get everyone into the game and playing the great content we have waiting for them.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you are frustrated. I want nothing more than for you to not be frustrated. Hopefully today will go better for you and many others. High population realms may be problematic when it comes to queue times, but we are making efforts to get more people in than hanging in the queues. Our efforts aren't stopping any time soon. No one is sitting on their laurels (I'm not sure why you'd want to really.) People will accuse us of many many things I'm sure. Conspiracies arise that just aren't true and there isn't much we can do to counter them than to keep working toward improving the experiences of the community that is here to play. We are very seriously continuing to monitor all of the changes we've made and their impact. Things have improved a great deal and we will continue to make improvements where we can. That's all I can really say. Some will believe and others won't. That isn't going to make us throw up our hands and give up. We wouldn't do that.

Blue Tweets<br />
Server Stability<br />
And as no one knows, CRZ saved the launch. (SeTec9 (https://twitter.com/SeTec9/status/534112738050453505))<br />
<br />
We just added new hardware with this maintenance in attempts of coping with demand. Realms are looking pretty stable. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/533673286391959552))<br />
Stable, yes. Sufficient, no. It's a simple matter of Blizzard blindly putting it's pocketbook ahead of its customers. Money &gt; Rep<br />
There is no problem I've had in the last 72 hours I could fix with money. If there was I'd do it. Actually not true: there was one, and we had more blades next restart -- problem not as simple (kurtismcc (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/533764522788413442))<br />
One cant fix problemshappening now with money, but better preparations could have been made. 2 hour queue time still.<br />
Some servers are very high pop. We know this is a problem, but problem can't be solved with more hardware. We are still working on other solutions. (kurtismcc (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/534054450588291072))<br />
The calibre of those solving problems now doesn't absolve Blizzard's lack of preparation.<br />
You choose your perspective on such matters. Mistakes were made, but there's no grand money conspiracy. (kurtismcc (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/534074078525542400))<br />
Blizzard had a good idea on the amount of people returning from expansion sales<br />
Sales does not equal engagement, and engagement drives concurrency. We have a very engaging expansion, and I'm happy to have worked on it.<br />
but your network should be able to handle enough users to equal your subscriber # and then some for growth<br />
load isn't linear - clumps are the issue like the forum post says - it's an n-squared problem (kurtismcc (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/534074264811360256))<br />
Since it was known that high pop realms would be a problem; there should have been free migrations prior to launch.<br />
even if we'd predicted it, wouldn't have helped; most people wouldn't have seen the need to move prior to launch (kurtismcc (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/534074955919400960))<br />

As much as I hate to report it, you can mount up while moving with Ice Floes. I assume that's not intended.<br />
We're going to allow it for now. If it becomes a problem, we'll change it back. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/532624446670913536))<br />

Art<br />
Not even a single mention of Blood Elf models through the whole Blizzcon? If you're not doing them, tell us please.<br />
We're doing them. Nothing else to announce until we have previews to show. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/531248921880698882))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Who should I tweet about profession-type stuff? Looking at the cap on Apexis Crystals currently<br />
What's the concern with the cap? That's more an item issue than professions per se. CC: @olandgren (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/532262251177467904))<br />
If you could instead save up 37k or w/e then choose a slot to fill, I might actually do it<br />
Very reasonable point - we'll discuss. We usually have at least some slush room on currency caps. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/532271338518364160))<br />

Paulie in Old Town, Stormwind Cost: 100 000 Gold (TerranGregory (https://twitter.com/TerranGregory/status/533867318942511105))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Are there any plans to make 5v5 skirmishes?<br />
No. Skirmishes is meant to be an introduction to the arena experience. Considered only doing 2v2 but know people would want 3s. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/530226047992619008))<br />
<br />
combat log event &quot;encounter_start&quot; happens in pve any chance of having this in pvp, to enable accurate arena/bg combat logging?<br />
yes we have it on our todo list (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/531817102232272896))<br />
<br />
Does MMR get Zero'ed at the beginning of each season along with the Character rating?<br />
Your MMR gets reset when you gain a level but not between seasons. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/531817234478661632))<br />
is there a design reason for this? Starting season on 1500 MMR win 100 lose 30 would you have the same final CR as 2k MMR start?<br />
We don't think resetting MMR each season is good for the game. High rated will stomp over low rated. No value in that. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/531864995244408833))<br />
<br />
Hey Holinka, will PvP Items have sockets? And what about tertiar stats?<br />
Not at launch. Perhaps down the road. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/531933081259606016))<br />
Ah thank you^^. I don't know what that means&quot;down the road&quot;. Do you mean at the start of WoD Season 1 on 2nd of december?<br />
It means, we haven't decided if or when. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/531934210584350720))<br />
<br />
Ever thought of a battleground dota/smite style, 5vs5 3way?<br />
Yes but it's a very odd fit for WoW and there are a lot of other games (including Heroes) doing it. Doesn't feel natural. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/532190847694274561))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Unfortunately Jaina is too far gone. Corrupted just like everyone else in the alliance.<br />
Not at all, man. Jaina doesn't trust the Horde to self-govern... Can you blame her? (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/531233921069879296))<br />
<br />
In WoD timeline: Gul'dan the only one with fel energy/green skin? Possible exposure changes rest? Or staying brown?<br />
Gul'dan won't stay down for long - he'll find other fools. I mean, followers. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/532052882733137920))<br />
<br />
I said that the Kirin Tor's ability to assert control over how the alliance uses magic has waned over time. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/532062405581611008))<br />
That doesn't mean it's gone entirely. We haven't seen it come to a head in a while amidst other crises. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/532062653620166656))<br />
Thank you for the clarity. Could you take more questions on this? Are you able to say more on the topic?<br />
I keep up with lore, but my focus is more on gameplay and world. Mr. Copeland will typically be a bit stronger with the lore-fu. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/532613306138112001))<br />
<br />
Any chance Blood Elf Paladins can get a red casting animation, or anything other than the yellow hands? Blood Knight love?<br />
Part of your lore is giving up the blood aspect/draining the Naaru and embracing the light, no? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/532449374820110336))<br />

The dungeons are a hell of a lot easier than the Cataclysm ones. As a healer, the big issues with pugs have been the first two bosses of Grimrail, fist boss of UBRS, last boss of Bloodmaul Slag Mines, and the third boss in Skyreach. Everything has a complete joke with premade groups.<br />
<br />
Regarding loot, Personal loot is much better for gearing up than group loot. We're getting 2-3 pieces off some bosses and there's rarely a kill where no one gets anything.<br />
<br />
I won't argue with Everbloom having a lot of trash, though.</div></div><hr />

Indeed Zeala is quite challenging but you can always see where the flames are going to be by spotting the drake before it ''lands''.<br />
<br />
HC dungeons are waaay easier then Cata pre-nerf, I have pugged every Heroic and never had any problem in them where as in Cata I was having serious problems :)</div></div><hr />

I don't know if you're trolling or not, but if you are not, I'm just gonna go ahead and suggest you stick to questing/normal dungeons.<br />
<br />
I've been chaining heroic in a premade group with 4 buddies, and sure we have to be careful when pulling mobs, but this is only due to lack of gear. We make money out of it (~100g per heroic I'd say), even do some of the achievements. Heroics are NOT SUPPOSED to be steamrolled right from the get go, especially if you don't like to think when playing and try to be better at the game (like you probably aren't doing since you're here whining about something being too hard). They still are HEROIC instances. If you can't handle them, stick to Normals.<br />
<br />
Loot is RNG, stop complaining. I've had runs with 0 loot, I've had runs with 3 loots in a single instance. Deal with it. You can repeat instances as much as you like. If you had all your items after 1 run of each instance you'd be whining there's no content and you're already decked out.</div></div><hr />

Heroics aren't even close to Cataclysm heroics in terms of difficulty. In pre-nerf Cataclysm I was lucky if I could complete the whole instance with the same group. In WoD I've been pugging heroics since Friday and only once I have been in a group that couldn't defeat the boss before people quit (and that was Grimrail's first boss). I've also completed every HC dungeon without using CC, it helps a lot in some cases but isn't mandatory by any means. You could also run 10 dungeons in previous expansions and only see wrong armor type dropping. I agree that trash is a bit on the heavy side but for example in Everbloom much of it can be skipped if people don't go around pulling stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, interesting, because the normal dungeon runs I've been on have been an absolute cake walk. I've seen no complaints from anyone else in my guild about them being hard at all, either. Quite the opposite, actually.<br />
<br />
HC dungeons are harder--and they're meant to be, which is why people are required to finish Silver-level Proving Grounds before attempting them via LFG--but I honestly wouldn't want them any other way. I'm not sure why you'd be seeing people with Legendary cloaks causing issues since the proc is supposed to be disabled at level 100. If you ARE seeing this then perhaps a bug report is in order. Or you could just be lying for effect. *shrug*<br />
<br />
All of the Heroics I ran during the beta were done via the LFG tool, and while some of them were certainly a challenge, I'd estimate that about 80% of the time we made it through pretty well. If you don't want an extra layer of difficulty, form your own group of people you trust and don't use the LFG tool. Simple as.<br />
<br />
Your experience with the loot seems like your own bad luck (or, again, hyperbole). Once again I've heard several instances of people getting 2 or more upgrades in a single run. Your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
The only dungeon where the trash may be excessive is Everbloom, but even there you can skip most of it if your party pays attention.<br />
<br />
Honestly, at this point it just sounds like you're either an easy-mode player to the core or just salty about something else and trying to pin it on whatever you can.</div></div><hr />

Uhhh... what? I've been doing nothing but pugs and I have had zero issues in heroics (normals I didnt even realize wiping was an OPTION). Also haven't used CC at all. WAY easier then cata pre-nerf heroics. I dunno what pugs you were getting into, mine seem to be fine.</div></div><hr />

The problem is not in the Difficulty lv but in the Healing !! Blizz fuct up healing BIG!! time and most of the healers cant hadle it ... Healers can either heal the tank or party, cant do both.Well RNG is a B.. so ar the loot drops.The Bigest ishue ar the Crafts and apexis items , crafts ar to expensive and not worth the efort at all , so ar the Apexis items ... It was already stupid on Beta , Big FAIL here.... whus goin to kill 100 000 mobs to get full Apex gear ??? Not a single casual player thats for sure and hardcores?? they will stay with CM loot .Yeah ... For the Hord ... my ass.</div></div><hr />

Normal dungeons are not that difficult. You just need to apply yourself /somewhat/, it's no end of expansion MoP anymore. Being casual doesn't mean you're shit. It means you play casually<br />
<br />
HC dungeons. Again, not harder than Cata, challenging, but not harder than cata. Move the fuck away from the CC mobs then? Apply yourself. . Pugs can never handle heroics at the start of the expansion, because it's the start of the expansion, noone has gear, and we've never done the dungeons before. Go with friends or guildies if you can't handle the dungeon finder. Why remove it from the DF? Just don't use it if you don't want to use it. &quot;I don't want to or need to use it, so it SHOULD BE REMOVED!!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. It's not CRZ, it's the literally opposite of CRZ. We're not doing anything cross-realm, they're splitting the realm into phases to handle the load. It might be the same tech but it's like using the force for good (this time) instead of evil (gd CRZ)<br />
<br />
2. &quot;Saved&quot;? Really? Because I finally hit level 100 last night. Which would be really fast but see, some of my guildies managed to defeat the queue boss and hit level 100 a couple days ago. Like my GL/RL. and they've been running heroics and gearing up for December second when the raid launches. If I want a spot, I have to be geared up too. And I'm behind. <br />
<br />
I've had flashes of &quot;Damn, this'd be pretty fun if I had time to enjoy it&quot; but other than that this hasn't &quot;saved&quot; anything for me. At best it's made it so that I can hopefully log in and play without a 6 (two days ago) or 4 (yesterday) hour queue.</div></div><hr />

Considering CMs have a set ilvl, anyone can do it. No need to gear up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It scales any gear above 630 ilvl down to 630 I'm pretty sure. So if that's the case you need 630 in order to have a chance at gold.<br />
<br />
Edit: Well, for the average player I mean :p</div></div><hr />

Would of been nice if there was a snapshot of pre 6.0 flex, normal, and heroic. From memory, post one month that all LFR wings was out had about the same amount clearing Flex than had after one year of ICC 10 man. Shows how much more popular traditional raiding is in MoP even over the so called casual holy grail of WotLK.</div></div><hr />

I've been blazing through heroics like they're nothing. Extremely easy compared to the 3-5 hour heroics Cataclysm had at launch.</div></div><hr />

I call BS. I never had any dungeon lasting longer than 1 hr at Cata launch. Neither they were wipefests.<br />
Maybe it is because I tanked them, I don't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normal dungeons are not even close to the casual friendly level... Wipefest all the time, BRS last boss harder than HC raid bosses in MoP...<br />
<br />
HC dungeons are harder than cata dungeons before nerf.<br />
And an extra cripsy thing: Most of the players come with legendary back, but the proc on that hit out all the CC-ed mobs.... = wipefest everywhere <br />
They need to remove HC-s from DF, pugs cannot handle those....<br />
<br />
Amazing loot system: 12 normal dungeons = 1 loot. 7 hc run = 0 loot. 4k gold for repair... We want to get back the old loot system at least we could won enchants....<br />
<br />
And so much trash almost everywhere, Deadmines happend again! People just leave the *Growingleaf* dungeon where is more trash than in all MoP dungeons.<br />
<br />
A) If normal dungeons are wipefests, you are utter bad. <br />
B) If heroic dungeons seem harder than cata, you haven't played cataclysm at release, people just need to understand the bosses (which means explaining it to them)<br />
C) Legendary Cloak proc stops working once you hit level 100.<br />
D) I haven't had problems with dungeon finder and randoms in heroics, pretty smooth raids. <br />
E) If you don't want personal loot, make a group and makes yourself to the dungeon portals in the zone and enter that way<br />
F) Stop spreading false information.</div></div><hr />

Lucky guy. My first Grim Batol HC clear took 3 hours because a varying amount of people couldn't figure out how to slow the adds on the last boss and kept leaving. Spent a total of 2½ hours on that alone. I think I went through what could have amounted to two full new groups before it finally died.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you had to be online enough to hit level 100 and get that minimum level of gear. Most people still haven't been able to be on long enough to hit level 100 and when you do hit 100 you don't have the gear for CMs.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if it's been suggested, or is even possible but I would find the Proving Grounds data from MoP interesting. Specifically, the % of people whom successfully completed Gold and Endless Waves (30) for the &quot;Proven&quot; titles.<br />
<br />
Appreciate the consideration and thanks for your time!</div></div><hr />

About Proving Grounds etc. Blizz wasn't intrested to boost competition there. Nothing special for best players, only satisfaction.</div></div><hr />
