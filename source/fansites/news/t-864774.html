Anniversary Video: A History of Blizzard Entertainment<br />
Did you know that Blizzard Entertainment was originally founded under a completely different name? What is the significance of Jawassic Park in the context of Blizzard Entertainment's art culture? Whatever happened to Orcs in Space? These and many, many more questions are answered in the full-length video we've just released on the Blizzard 20th Anniversary site. Clocking in at almost an hour, this video features candid commentary from the people who have spent the last two decades creating the games that helped make Blizzard Entertainment the company it is today.<br />
<br />
Head over to the anniversary site and check out the Blizzard Retrospective Video (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/b20/videos.html#blizzard-retrospective) now!<br />

<br />
Correct me if i'm wrong, but i think this will be inside the portal in Sulfaron Spire in Mount Hyjal.<br />
<br />
The screenshots reminded me of oblivion gates from oblivion, just with wow graphics i actually like it better.<br />
Thinking of it the graphic in wow is really nice even though it's not of such high quality it's simplicity just suits it so well.<br />
<br />
I think the zones look awesome and i love having more daily quests available, i just hope they give more bang for the bucks than tol'barad, because tb dailys give such a love income of gold i can do basicly anything else to get it.</div></div><hr />

7. Spamming and Trolling<br />
This includes but is not necessarily limited to the following:<br />
<br />
* Excessively communicating the same phrase, similar phrases, or pure gibberish<br />
* Creating threads for the sole purpose of causing unrest on the forums<br />
* Causing disturbances in forum threads, such as picking fights, making off topic posts that ruin the thread, insulting other posters<br />
* Making non-constructive posts<br />
* Abusing the Reported Post feature by sending false alarms or nonsensical messages<br />
* Numbering a thread, IBTL, TLDR, or any other fad statements<br />
* Thread-necro: Reviving an old thread for no reason other than bumping it to the first page<br />
* Replying to a thread simply to call the author a troll (regardless of whether the post is actually trolling)<br />
<br />
Thought this was pretty funny.</div></div><hr />

It's the administrators and moderators job to detect and deal with trolls.<br />
<br />

I embrace all opportunities to use ground mounts. In a world where you can skip everything by flying over it, having a few areas where you're grounded keeps it in perspective. In my opinion, of course.</div></div><hr />

there was nothing challenging, nor fun about having to craft crappy blue quality gear for 40 people in order to down one boss. c**kblocks like FR gear is just about the lamest, and laziest mechanic a developer can rely on in order to make something &quot;hard&quot;.<br />

I'm guessing the people saying these things are kids. Back in the old days of games things like that made perfect sense or having to go back to the first area of a game to get an item and then hoof it bakc to the new area was pretty normal. The fact is that long haul stuff and resistances are a basic part of games for alot of older folks. Well at least those who didn;t grow up on FPS games and played games that had alot of things to do without any multiplayer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
'Cock blocks' like resistance fights were hardly a challenge... more of a time sink.<br />
<br />
The last resistance check fight in BT was probably the worst time sink ever considering the farming needed to be done in actual raids in order to do the content. Stupidest implementation ever, force players to do content for several weeks just to down the next boss.</div></div><hr />

kids or not, its correct.<br />
it never was a challenge getting fire resist back in classic, shadow resist in TBC, or frost resist in wrath.<br />

I'm guessing you're an omniscient being and know for sure who the posters are, and it has nothing to do with the fact people's tastes are different, and some don't like long un-challenging grinds put into games to lengthen their playtime at the cost of fun and creativity.<br />
<br />
Just because something used to be done like this doesn't mean it has to be this way always - not to dumb things down so that &quot;kids&quot; can play and &quot;veterans&quot; can be elitist about it, but because some ways are better. It's nice that you have some nice memories, but nostalgia glasses aren't always good.</div></div><hr />

If you haven't, well....you're not a person and thus not part of everyone :)<br />
<br />
I enjoy their splitting of raids. It reminds me of the end of FF6 (EN 3) where you had to split. Like first boss in SWP or going in the stomach of C'Thun. They have nice ideas. I think Firelands will be pretty epic, I mean, it has to be!</div></div><hr />

What was actually challenging about gathering a set amount of Fire, Frost, Shadow, Nature resitance? Really tell me what the challenge was? It was invicible walls put up to slow down guilds from progressing as fast as they could have.<br />
<br />
You cant in no way whatsoever actually convince me that getting resistance gear was ever challenging.<br />

Are you actually saying everyone who doesn't see resistance gear grinding and whatnot as interesting things has to be kids?<br />
<br />
Sure it makes perfect sense to backtrack in games, I love backtracking if it's done right in games, but the case of resistance gear in WoW was not entertaining or fun, it was nothing more then just a cheap time sink because they had nothing better to come up with at the time.</div></div><hr />

It adds an extra dimension to fights and the game world iteslf in my mind. I mean think about it think about the feel of finally getting all that armor done and then walking into an area to kill a big bad boss and finally achioeving it. The anticipation the waiting and then finally killing him i;m sorry but even just the thought of that i find exciting. Plus having to gain all that gear i could see just increasing the feel of how dangerous this guy is and that you;re actually fighting him.

<br />
It's true. I know what you mean. And it wasn't THAT hard to get SR gear to fight Mother Shahraz...considering how much people farm reputation and do dailies, resist gear farming is the same exact thing. You're farming the raids anyway...if they can time it so by the time you're at the boss you already have almost enough mats to make the gear, why would it matter anyway? I'd be fine with that. I think FR gear is perfectly fine to be honest...if they do it right. It'll add a nice sense of old style yet not make you farm it too hard. Is there anything wrong with resist gear in that sense?</div></div><hr />

Really tell me what the challenge was? It was invicible walls put up to slow down guilds from progressing as fast as they could have.<br />
<br />
You cant in no way whatsoever actually convince me that getting resistance gear was ever challenging.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you actually saying everyone who doesn't see resistance gear grinding and whatnot as interesting things has to be kids?<br />
<br />
Sure it makes perfect sense to backtrack in games, I love backtracking if it's done right in games, but the case of resistance gear in WoW was not entertaining or fun, it was nothing more then just a cheap time sink because they had nothing better to come up with at the time.<br />
<br />
Yeah i guess and i can see some of your points but again it;s kinda the feel of the idea of having to prep JUST for that guy or his area that could make it so much more epic. Maybe if they found a new way to implement it but i still like rei think it could add an extra dimension to the game if done rigth or at least a better feel. Right now my main is raid geared and one of the few in my guild so i really don;t feel like i have much to do other than log on on raid night and see if we'll actually be raiding that day. At least gather res gear or working for it would give me something to do. Also it would be useful for LW, BS and other crafters to do again. Hell i even miss the specializations. I guess you could say that while i like the easier aspects or simpler in some ways leveling and smoother content at the same time i miss the challenges we used to have. Do yeah i guess i'm suffering from nostalgia but it's more of a generalized form than just wow related.</div></div><hr />

I'm all for challenges, I love challenges, but I dont consider it a challenge to have to spend tim gathering gear you'll only use for a couple of bosses to completely avoid a mechanic they added to a boss simply because they wanted you to go out and grind and spend time on it. Add real propper challenging time sinks sure, but just stale grinds I dont see as a challenge at all.</div></div><hr />

The dev zone pretty much spells out no flying unless they remove, which I doubt it as they probably place bets to see how long it takes for player to break into them.<br />

Points still there. It's get geared raid get tier gear and other drops new raid tier get new raid gear get new drops and teir etx. Come next xpac level get geared raid get tier and raid drops then go on and on. No matter how you look at it it takes time for getting gear either way.

Why? What possible enjoyment is there is in gathering a whole separate set of gear for one zone/raid? It just screams: &quot;We only want people with too much time on their hands to do this raid&quot;.<br />
Edit to add:<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the people saying these things are kids. Back in the old days of games things like that made perfect sense or having to go back to the first area of a game to get an item and then hoof it bakc to the new area was pretty normal. The fact is that long haul stuff and resistances are a basic part of games for alot of older folks. Well at least those who didn;t grow up on FPS games and played games that had alot of things to do without any multiplayer.<br />
I'm from the &quot;old days of gaming&quot;, I played all those games you're talking about. The most irritating and frustrating part of them was spending hours wandering back through areas where you were some sort of demigod of death to pick up some item that you needed to kill something in the last dungeon. Most games need an element of grind, otherwise they go *too* quickly, but minimizing the grind is a good plan. Right now WoW has essentially four tiers of grind. Initial leveling to 85, grind to get heroic mode gear, then grind to get raid gear; on the side is the grind for rep which is part of, but somewhat separate from, the other three. That's plenty of grind.</div></div><hr />

But yeah, like Sorrior pointed out, you had to do something in order to get forward. <br />
<br />
These days I only log on if I'm going to do 1 heroic with my Alt or if it's raiding night, since there is no point or benefit of doing anything else. Everything is also so cheap because getting money is so easy, and even getting Dark Phoenix for 3k gold is the same as costing like 100 gold on vanilla.<br />
<br />
<br />
That much of time (or the lack of) I have to invest on this game these days, that's it's not really a challenge as a whole anymore. =P</div></div><hr />
