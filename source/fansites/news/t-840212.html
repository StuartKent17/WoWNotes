Tol Barad faction balance &quot;exploit&quot;<br />
It doesn't actually work. The balance of factions is not dependant on if you’re in a raid or not. It's a mis-perception based on the inability to see the opposing team's numbers. What’s happening is that you can leave a raid, remain in Tol Barad, and because your old raid may pick up an additional player from the queue there’s an assumption that your side is getting more players. In fact the other side is keeping up and also getting additional players. We’ve verified across a number of realms that faction balance remains equal, even in cases where we found people actively attempting to use this to outnumber the opposing team. They weren't.<br />
<br />
We keep a close eye on Tol Barad faction balance and turnover. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/154560/tol-barad-and-the-100-vs-30-fight))<br />

Dungeon &amp; Raids Changes in 4.0.6<br />
Granted those 80 or so lines of changes may not all be difficulty adjustments, but the majority of them will help in some way. You could argue that they're not the right changes, or not enough, and I could counter argue that they are, and you should try it first. But, what I don't believe you can accuse us of is sticking our fingers in our ears and ignoring anything. Not jumping to implement every request, yes, making measured approaches to alterations, yes, a slow decrease in content difficulty over time, yes indeed.

PvP Set Bonus Nerf in 4.0.6<br />
Right now some hybrid classes benefit from wearing a pair of 2 piece set bonuses in PvP instead of their 4 piece bonus. We don't much like that behavior though, and we're going to eventually make the two bonuses exclusive so you can only ever have one 2 piece bonus at a time. We're not going to make that change in 4.0.6 as we realize some people have spent a lot of points to buy into the double-2 piece bonuses. However, it is likely we'll make the change at the start of the next PvP season. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/153934/pvp-set-bonus-nerf-is-a-slap-in-the-face))<br />

Arena 2200 Weapons Delay<br />
Sometimes, you have to make an unpopular decision, and you take a lot of heat for it. I understand that you guys aren't happy, and I'm sorry about that.<br />
<br />
With regard to the weapon delay, as with any change which affects your gameplay, we always prefer to provide advance notice whenever possible, but in some situations it isn't an option. Unfortunately, this was one of those cases.<br />
<br />
Some of you may recall that there were times in the past when it was common for the Arenas to be flooded by geared raiders actively engaging in arena matches exclusively to acquire weapons for the sake of defeating PvE content. That's not the intended design for arena rewards (that they be part of PvE progression), and that was a situation that we were hoping to avoid now. Raid content is very challenging currently, and as a direct result, there are fewer top tier weapons floating around. What we didn't want was a 'gold rush' on arenas, which would diffuse the competitive space there as well as give PvE focused players an undue advantage for raid content.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, what we really want is parity in the availability of top end PvP and PvE weaponry. We want to see top end PvP and PvE items filtering into the player community at roughly the same time. This delay is an effort to achieve that aforementioned parity in this case. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/154031/when-life-gives-you-lemons))<br />

Tabard Storage<br />
We have a variety of things that we want to do as part of ongoing development for World of Warcraft, and a storage solution for tabards is just one of them. We understand that many of you care about this kind of feature, so we want to make sure that whatever we come up with is not only in line with our design goals (both in the short- and long-term), but is also appealing to you. We know that you have a lot of ideas on how this may be accomplished, so we're going to be keeping an eye on your discussions in the meantime. We may ask questions or point out potential concerns along the way, but don't let that discourage you; we love that you're being open with us and want you to keep sharing your thoughts and criticisms -- constructively, of course. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/153908/tabard-spam))<br />
<br />
More Bank Slots?<br />
We're not aware of any current plans to increase bank slots. The only thing that comes to mind is pretty much what other players have already pointed out -- bigger bags. With that in mind, you might have noted that in patch 4.0.6 the Illusionary Bag is being increased to 26 slots. I know you're saying that won't help you much though, but it can't hurt to mention it for others who might not be in quite as dire a situation storage-wise as you are.

He's pointing it out because it was first nerfed to 20 seconds, then nerfed harder to 25 seconds, now brought back to 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
The humor comes from the fact that they apparently thought 20 seconds wasn't enough so they added 5 more seconds, then they thought both 25 seconds and 20 seconds was too much so they changed it in the other direction.<br />
<br />
If I had to guess, though, I'd bet the 25 second nerf was a mistake and they originally meant to bring it from 20 seconds to 15.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with pve mage dps is that they have to weave scorches in between fireballs or they run OOM and have to spam scorch waiting for mana to come back.<br />
<br />
Reducing mana costs = Less Scorches = More Fireball = More Damage done = More DPS<br />

Proof that warlock balancing consists of nerfing something, then adjusting it repeatedly until it becomes acceptable again.<br />
Increasing the cooldown by 150%, another 25% and then reducing to 64% of that is understandably confusing.<br />
We were told that mana draining abilities were too powerful, and with the removal of Drain Mana that Mana Burn would be evaluated. Which as of yet there is no sign of, and by the looks of it will no longer happen.<br />
As usual a mechanism which is deemed too good, only gets nerfed or in this case totally removed from warlocks yet is all of a sudden seen as fine elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

* Master of Tol Barad no longer requires For Whom The Barad Tols.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's because they're changing the way Tol Barad can be won.<br />
<br />
Attackers need to control all three locations and on double faction realms, this is almost impossible to successfully attack Tol Barad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Attacking Faction has Areas A &amp; B<br />
Defending Faction has Areas C<br />
<br />
Attacking Faction attacks C (all or majority)<br />
Defending Faction ZERGS A<br />
<br />
Defending Faction wins Area A<br />
Attacking faction wins Area C<br />
<br />
Attacking Faction attacks A<br />
Defending Faction attacks B<br />
<br />
Defending faction wins B<br />
Attacking Faction wins A<br />
<br />
Thankfully the attacking team now only has to control 2 of 3 areas when the timer expires to take control of Tol'Barad.<br />
<br />
My realm's Faction (which takes up majority of the realm) have been unable to win Tol Barad for atleast a week now.</div></div><hr />

Rather glad they decided to allow us to cast the spell that actually works with the mastery.<br />
<br />
And requires a Glyph to work. <br />
<br />
Which is more or less the same as Fireball except instead of a direct DoT, the Fireball Glyph improves the chance of applying Ignite on the target, which is by far, our largest DoT.</div></div><hr />

Lots of fights feature a ton of movement where you cast Scorch over Fireball anyway.<br />
<br />
And there isn't a single fight where Scorch will provide more overall damage than Fireball. When you say &quot;Scorch isn't that big of a DPS loss&quot; those calculations were all done as spells themselves, and didn't take spells that compliment either spell, like Combustion and Ignite. That said, you also have to be careful reading too much into what the Sims are saying, because Rawr for example, values Haste more than Mastery, which at any gear level isn't true in practice. I personally haven't seen raw parses acknowledging that Scorch is close to Fireball, they've all been simmed which are hard to believe at this point in time.<br />
<br />
The problem is that people think there's a huge problem with Fire. The reason we aren't seeing &quot;10% more critzzzz&quot; is because it's pretty obvious being a Fire Mage in mostly epics now... that we're scaling up quite fast. They need to be very careful how they tweak us, because even a small change like increased damage or crit, is going to result in a nerf next tier and we'll be back to where we started. I think mana reductions is the best way to do it, to promote using our highest DPS spells and leave Scorch in its place, as a mobile DPS and debuffing tool.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we Fire Mages just have to have some patience and perseverance. We're starting out really slow. As the expansion progresses, we'll scale up. I would personally have it this way, than be on a rollercoaster of buffs and nerfs like some other classes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Izuria</div><div class="date">2011-01-27, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, it is<br />

In Paragon/Method and other very top level guilds classes are brought for a set of specific reasons (for unique buffs, on-demand burst, aoe strength on big or small adds, and many more).<br />
Fire mages are good at AOE on medium to high HP mobs, as everyone knows, that was the reason they were brought in, and aoe was their task. That's why their DPS was comparable to other specs. Arcane mages are brought for hard target switches and high burst on demand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well considering a Lock has to have the Felhunter out to use it, where as a Mage needs nothing out to spam the hell out of Spellsteal. So its still very much unblanced in favor of mages. Dont worry you can still smack your face on the keyboard to win.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Still no Mage nerfs.<br />
Blizzard rules.<br />
<br />
This one time, a melee touched a mage, so blizz had to do something about that.<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yay, new build lets see if there's something cool.. oh mage stuff, i hope they get nerfed in pvp... nvm&quot;<br />

<br />
Reducing mana costs = Less Scorches = More Fireball = More Damage done = More DPS<br />
<br />
Yes, they are indeed fixing pve mage dps by reducing mana costs.<br />
<br />
Other than AoE intensive fights where I find myself needing to cast Flamestrike multiple times, I rarely have any serious mana problems. I would rather they keep a system that rewards mana conservation, than implement a 'fix' that just makes it ignorable again.<br />
<br />
They should instead find a way to buff damage without affecting current mana mechanics.</div></div><hr />

Thankfully the attacking team now only has to control 2 of 3 areas when the timer expires to take control of Tol'Barad.<br />
<br />
My realm's Faction (which takes up majority of the realm) have been unable to win Tol Barad for atleast a week now.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that is incorrect. It would be kind of stupid to do it that way anyways, as the battle will just be pointless until the end.<br />
<br />
What I heard is that if the attackers control 2/3 bases, capturing the 3rd base goes faster to prevent the defenders from just tunneling. What is meant by faster is unclear though. My hope is that faster means that the each attacker would count for 1.5-2 for the purpose of attacking, in that you can take the base from the defenders even if they out number you a moderate amount. It could also mean that once you do out number them it takes a lot less time to capture the base.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has said:<br />
1. They want the game to be easier for the defenders, instead of it constantly flipping like wintergrasp.<br />
2. It is ok, if the faction that has a lower population has an advantage in TB, as this would hopefully encourage players to that faction instead of like wintergrasp, where the larger faction had an advantage and only encouraged players to go to that larger faction, making the problem even worse.</div></div><hr />

And I would counter and say that it's an l2play issue for your hunter, at the very least.<br />

Hunters and Destruction locks are about 1.5k DPS ahead of fire mages, which is a large enough gap to almost always place them at the top. A slight mana reduction won't equate to that big of a DPS increase.</div></div><hr />

These are changes for FIRE mages. They are great changes for FIRE mages. (Or are the fire mages too scary for all of you too now?) <br />
<br />
As for nerfs to mages. I'm assuming you all play pvp. They did that already. <br />
<br />
15% damage nerf. Pay attention. Many of you read it as a buff. You see only what you want to it seems.<br />
<br />
If you want more than that nerf, you obviously don't understand how the class works and shouldn't be posting anything in regards to it.<br />
<br />
Spellsteal is offensive only. Unlike other dispells, it only works offensively. Buffs it takes can only last a max of 2 minutes. Its random. It costs a hefty amount of mana to use. It has plenty of downside already. <br />
<br />
Leave it alone. Find another class to pick on. Some of us would like to actually have a useful spell for PvE where it actually makes a huge difference anyway. <br />
<br />

I can't complain about destro DPS, it's very nice and BoH is just amazing on some fights, but [Rain of Failure] (lol, that's an awesome name, Tinkerspell) is really weak. It's so weak that i found out that destro's Hellfire still does more damage. The only fight where i use destro and still bother to AoE something is magmaw.

Adjusted totals for 25 heroic puts mages in the middle putting out an average dps of 18.5k right in the middle of everyone else, beneath warlock, DK, balance druid, priest and above Warrior, Hunter, Rogue, Shaman and Paladin coming in at second place with 652 samples second only to Survival Hunters with 741 samples as of this posting.

Being in the middle as the 'glass cannon' of WoW isn't exactly what I call great placement, and as I noted before, 1.8k difference from the top spot is a fairly sharp gap to make up based on skill alone.</div></div><hr />

Don't even pull that glass cannon BS here. Clothies complained so much in this game that all of them are now more resilient and have more survivability than anything wearing plate. You have more CC and more damage avoidance/mitigation/snare/stun/slow/trap than you know what to do with. You have more buttons for CC than fit on a keyboard. You're not glass cannons anymore. You're just cannons. Take this BS somewhere else, please.<br />
<br />
Edit: And just because you get rocked by DKs all the time doesn't mean that they have more survivability than you. They're your hard class counter since you seem to be the hard class counter to every other class in the game. Deal with it.<br />
<br />
Edit2: And including Halfus into the spreadsheet mages have the highest average dps in the game across all bosses, but that's not good enough for them. They wanna be the top dps on every single individual boss reguardless of fight mechanics. Unfortunately, this isn't how balance is ever approached and they should've buffed Ele/Enh/RESTO Shaman, Ret Paladin, Feral Druid and Fury War before they even touched Mages. Why fury warrior you ask, when they can just respec to arms? Arms isn't a raiding spec, it's a PvP spec. It being higher damage than Fury is like Frost being better damage than Fire or Arcane. It doesn't make any sense and it does make 1 of 3 Warrior specs absolutely worthless, but even that doesn't compare to Shaman in which all 3 specs are currently subpar, underpowered, and practically unplayable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me just start with this &quot;I don't have a lock, I don't play a lock&quot;. That said, locks are not OP. Affliction was, but it's being brought in line with the others. Mages are WTFOP. They are DKs before the necrotic strike nerf. Complete and total faceroll. I won't complain if I get beat by one, hey that's just part of the game. It usually doesn't happen, but I'm very lucky I am in a class with lots of anti caster stuff. For classes that aren't though, I was as they just give up in frustration. Unable to touch a mage, when they get close the mage does a frost nova, or a dragon's breath. Then blinks away to start on a second attack. They even went so far as to bake a slow into arcane's attack. <br />
<br />
The answer though isn't to nerf everyone. Not at all. The answer is to buff everyone to be on par with mages.</div></div><hr />

Read again. Stateofdps takes all available parses from worldoflogs.com and subtracts the top 5% and the bottom 5%. It's an average spread of what your heroic fire mage should be doing.<br />
<br />
And hunters and rogues and shaman are beneath mages atm. I bet they can tank and heal right? Oh wait, Shaman can heal but they're literally abysmal healers current patch. Yeah, mages need buffs. /sarcasm<br />
<br />

All this says to me is that other classes AoE needs to be buffed and everyone single target needs to be brought into line with mages or they should just nerf mage AoE. Just because you're class happens to be really good or really weak at a fight doesn't change the fact that the fight exists in current raid content and should be balanced as such. I noticed none of you mages offering to take nerfs to your AoE for single target damage buffs. You're just average. Get over it and stop QQing so Blizzard can focus on classes that actually need adjustment.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suzaku</div><div class="date">2011-01-28, 04:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact that they adjusted the cooldown 3 times already is attracting quite justifiable complaints from warlocks.<br />
Proof that warlock balancing consists of nerfing something, then adjusting it repeatedly until it becomes acceptable again.<br />
Increasing the cooldown by 150%, another 25% and then reducing to 64% of that is understandably confusing.<br />
We were told that mana draining abilities were too powerful, and with the removal of Drain Mana that Mana Burn would be evaluated. Which as of yet there is no sign of, and by the looks of it will no longer happen.<br />
As usual a mechanism which is deemed too good, only gets nerfed or in this case totally removed from warlocks yet is all of a sudden seen as fine elsewhere.Mana Drain doesn't require that the target stand in line of sight for 2.5 seconds. All it requires is that the person be in Line of Sight for the initial tick and you can't stop it anymore except by wasting more mana to dispel it off of yourself and if you have an Unstable Affliction on you then you better pray that you don't hit UA instead with your dispel. Mana Burn has been nerfed from a 2.0 second cast to a 2.5 cast. If the Priest is interrupted or LoS during the cast time, then Mana Burn doesn't do anything. To be honest, I think Mana Burn should be removed from the game, so that Priests will finally have their mana regeneration be balanced in PvP like all other healers.<br />
<br />
And on the topic of Devour Magic, unless you are demonology, there is no reason for you to not have Felhunter out in Arena. Devour Magic on auto-spell cast is an extremely overpowered mechanic, since warlocks have an offensive dispel that requires no other work besides making sure that the pet is actually attacking the target. Now warlocks have to actually pay attention to use Devour Magic just like every other class with Offensive Dispel. All other warlock pets besides Felguards really only bring a single truly useful ability to arena however Felhunter brings two, so this change will also bring the Felhunter in line with the other pets.</div></div><hr />

Just because you're class happens to be really good or really weak at a fight doesn't change the fact that the fight exists in current raid content and should be balanced as such. I noticed none of you mages offering to take nerfs to your AoE for single target damage buffs. You're just average. Get over it and stop QQing so Blizzard can focus on classes that actually need adjustment.<br />
<br />
I would be perfectly fine with that, because I look at the bigger picture. I would rather sack some AoE dps to be a contender for the top spot again on non-gimmick fights, no one wants to be the 'king of aoe,' if it only ensures your raid spot on specific encounters.</div></div><hr />

Mage single target DPS is currently dead average. The lower dps classes that aren't on top and can't spec to something on top should be brought up and those on top should be brought down. That's the nature of balancing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Compare his damage done to the actual boss with the other classes... I'm sure the mage is casting living bombs on adds to get use of his 10% haste buff and such doing more damage... also its possible that he is casting combustion on sayd adds and impact spread them.<br />

Fixing one spec out of three isn't exactly what I would call fixing Mage dps. Blizz said they wanted Cata to give people more choices. The only choice for a mage atm is to go fire.</div></div><hr />

Dalaran/Shattrath Portals<br />
Those portals had a few fun side effects like letting people warp all around the world to do anything they felt like.<br />
going through a portal in dalaran or shattrath does not bring you to your end destination. When you are standing in dalaran and want to help someone in feralas, you still need to travel after you went through a portal. You probably think that traveling around the world for over 25 minutes is fun but I have to disagree.</div></div><hr />

Being in the middle as the 'glass cannon' of WoW isn't exactly what I call great placement, and as I noted before, 1.8k difference from the top spot is a fairly sharp gap to make up based on skill alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you even look @ parses on WoL, you would notice top 40 in 10 man reg/h + and mostly in the top 40 in 25 man reg/h are demo locks, not destro for Maloriak. Demo locks had their AoE dps nerfed, so stop whining.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirque</div><div class="date">2011-01-31, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love mages who say Spellsteal isn't useful in PvE, or that it has big downsides. It really hasn't. You must be one of those mages we structurally kick from our random dungeon groups for not offensively dispelling what you should even after being told to.<br />
<br />
That said, Fire mages have mana issues. They're not in need of any buffs though, as anyone who's raiding can say, Fire mages are scaling very, very rapidly as they gear, and as someone pointed out, any real buffs at this point will only result in nerfs later on. On the other hand, Arcane Mages are still stuck in their corner crying over their shit damage and nobody gives a rat's butt.<br />
<br />
That is a shame, because from my perspective, the whole bring the player and not the class ideology falls apart just looking at which classes bring the buffs. In our raid setup, having an Arcane mage is simply mandatory, as is having a Demo lock, yet again. I would be a happy puppy if spec specific buffs became more class specific, so both the mage and I get to actually pick which spec we want to play, and yes, in most cases that would be the spec which yields the most dps so we actually feel like more than just the buffbot that makes sure others &quot;top meters&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alvie</div><div class="date">2011-02-06, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were told that mana draining abilities were too powerful, and with the removal of Drain Mana that Mana Burn would be evaluated. Which as of yet there is no sign of, and by the looks of it will no longer happen.<br />
As usual a mechanism which is deemed too good, only gets nerfed or in this case totally removed from warlocks yet is all of a sudden seen as fine elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Mana Burn has been nerfed since 4.0.1. Pre-cata Discipline Priests had a talent that reduced the cast by 1 second... it was somewhere around 1.3-1.5 with 7-10% haste. Now , most priests are reforging a lot of their stuff into SPI, because our regen sucks, and the cast time is about 2.3 seconds, with 5%-ish haste, which makes it VERY susceptible to interrupts or LoS.<br />
Now, personally I DO think that -10% mana is a lot (about 9000-10000 mana now) and that part should be nerfed, but the cast time should be buffed.<br />
I would nerf it to 5% mana , and as a Discipline bonus (to avoid Mana Burn spamming Shadow Priests) make the base cast 1.5 seconds and 2 seconds for non Discipline. If Blizz takes this into consideration, the mana cost should only be 1000-1400 or else mana burning wont even be worth it.</div></div><hr />
