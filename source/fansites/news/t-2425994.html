<br />
You’re Invited!<br />
When: August 31–September 4<br />
Where: Queue for the 6-player scenario at your friendly neighborhood transmog NPC.<br />
What: Contestants will have two minutes to create transmog sets from items in their collection based on themes presented in the scenario. Two players at a time will be pulled up on stage to strike a pose and show off their creation—leaving the remaining four to vote on just who of the two has managed to capture the theme best.<br />
<br />
Collect All the Looks<br />
Collect all 8 Ensembles to keep adventuring in style.<br />

Don’t worry—even if you don’t win, there’s always the Trial of Style Consolation Prize. These prizes contain Trial of Style Tokens, which can be redeemed for special transmog gear in Dalaran.<br />
<br />
Fashion-conscious citizens of Azeroth can also take advantage of transmogrification and barbershop services for free during the Trial of Style. Even if you don’t participate, you can adjust your hairstyle and transmog for no gold cost while the event is active.<br />

Typical Blizzard: Do a stupid change no one asked for and add an &quot;as intended&quot; or &quot;correctly&quot; to the note so less people will complain because that's how it was always intended (even though it was never the case in beta and the item's tooltip doesn't contain an expiration note).<br />
<br />
As if scribes were so poor in BfA.<br />
<br />
Also damn, no new transmoggs. And I was already looking forward to Trial of Style (and glad the changed the date away from release week where it was first scheduled to be).</div></div><hr />

No. They're terrible enough as is (10 rep? 10? Give me a break). I'm not going to be crafting these, and I'm not going to be paying 1k for a 7 day buff that's awful.<br />

<br />
Problem is that with a limited duration and sticking to 10 rep per WQ, you paying thousands of gold for really very little reputation. 100 WQs, which is a LOT of WQs, gives 1000 rep. You would need to do a whopping 150 WQs in a single week to be worth a single emissary. <br />
<br />
Contracts should be worth 50 rep per WQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If rep is that core to the expansion, you need better ways to boost farming, like turn-ins for drops. They could tie it to azerite, which you're collecting anyway?<br />
<br />
It's really stunning how badly they've gutted some professions. I had a scribe up until WOD, and they always had things worth making. Even Dreanor had *some* perks worth leveling. I don't really see the point of inscription anymore - and I suspect the devs have the same view. They either don't know what to do with it, or don't want to do anything with it, but removing it would cause more unrest than shitty rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, it isn't broken in general - just in special cases.<br />
<br />
No, it's broken for some of us who don't have gathering professions at all on the toon. And it's still not fixed. I am a double crafter, alchemist/enchanter. But, I have no enchanting/alchemy world quests showing. The mining/herbing quests are showing in their place. I figured out last night that I really am getting my profession world quests, they're just not displaying for me. So if I know it's up from someone else with my professions I can craft the item and the ? mark will appear for the turn in. But, nothing ever alerts me to the quest being available due to the mining/herbing ones overriding them. This means I've probably missed several profession WQ as I never have any indicator that they are up.<br />
<br />
Now I do have a double gatherer leveled as well, but I was experiencing this bug long before I leveled the alt.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Contracts now correctly have a 7-day duration.&quot;<br />

I always feel when they do things like this that all the guys at Blizzard and the World Firsters have all gotten the needed rep. So they turn boosts off for the rest of us just to extend game play.<br />

I always feel when they do things like this that all the guys at Blizzard and the World Firsters have all gotten the needed rep. So they turn boosts off for the rest of us just to extend game play.<br />
<br />
You need one scribe per guild (at most). Inscription altogether could be removed and it wouldn't matter. They simply don't care about inscription or more generally about professions outside of maybe alchemy.</div></div><hr />

They're dirt cheap. Even if you do only 4 world quests a day that means 7 x 40 = 280 rep. Depending on the faction (especially Champions of Azeroth) that's still a very neat gain considering you're not actively pursuing rep. Now I went through just about all WQ's for a couple of weeks so it gave me thousands of rep which is absolutely worth it.<br />
<br />
All at the cost of a measly 50 to 100 gold. <br />
<br />
You could literally pick a single herb or mine a single node to get the money for your contract.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. They really need to redo professions from the ground up make them relevant or just remove them all together. I really don't care if you can make raid level gear and it not needing raid materials to make it AND it can be sold on the AH. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has always been scared in this regard..... Or just let professions just be to make cosmetic skins that you could sell on AH.</div></div><hr />

It's 2-3 times more difficulty than any other mythic trash to be honest. Dungeon tuning is really all over the place.<br />
<br />
Give me a break. Ya, that trash is the worst of the dungeons, but that's only because they have mechanics. All trash before bosses have mechanics that show you what you will be dealing with on the boss. Take a moment to learn these mechanics and all of a sudden, trash becomes easy. interrupts and simply SIDE STEPPING the attack deals with most of this. <br />
<br />
I swear we can't have anything with a modicum of difficulty in this game because people refuse to learn. This is a mythic dungeon. Can it be a bit tough plz??</div></div><hr />
