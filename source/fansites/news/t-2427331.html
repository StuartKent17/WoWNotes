No, it was meant to be a transmog only. It was never meant to have any stats on it. Theyve been making rare transmog only, no-stat items for the last few raids.</div></div><hr />

Yes but that was in an expansion that didn't have weapons due to artifacts. Now that we need weapons this is really stupid.</div></div><hr />

With artifacts weapon being gone, thats a pretty silly trend to continue. Must really suck for the people who thought they got an upgrade, only to get a silly transmog instead.</div></div><hr />

The journal lists the actual one that is correct and doesn't show the transmog version. The difference and confusion is transmog = &quot;of guardian&quot; and intended use = &quot;of the corrupted&quot; with the same name.</div></div><hr />

They really should make transmog only items a new color to reflect that they have no actual value to the players. The transmog doesn't even look good. *sigh*</div></div><hr />

I understand and defended all of the other player relations issues this xpac, but this is bullshit. I dont give a fuck what the mace looks like, I killed the boss and got a weapon upgrade. <br />
How do they think its okay to take that away from people? Its not like ti was broken, or too strong. Its exactly the same as the normal version of the mace, but red. Who the fuck cares what color it is?<br />

It hasn't been. The one in the journal is &quot;of the Corrupted&quot; which is the intended item. The &quot;of Guardian&quot; being the transmog one isn't in the journal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wasn't though. I know for a fact it wasn't because I entered every single item that was in the Dungeon Journal in by hand for the addon I worked on and nothing changed. Also a change like this would require a hotfix to edit the journal which there hasn't been one today (on my end at least) and the journal remains the same as ever.</div></div><hr />

Then why have I, and apparently many others judging by reports in the forums, been seeing two hammers in the journal for nearly a month with the two different names and colors? I saw the two with my own eyes while on my Arms warrior.</div></div><hr />

Probably not? Why is that something I would have screenshotted then? I assumed there were two hammers that drop for some reason. I thought it was weird and unfair to other weapon type users for sure but not screenshot worthy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then it just shows there probably wasn't even one. Even wowhead and wowdb who pull from the Dungeon Journal don't even show it being listed there and has no source. If it was in the dungeon journal someone would've cached it and showed it as a source.</div></div><hr />

It's basically fucked every single person who got it out of their raid night as well. They should grant those affected with the correct 355 version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It didn't. All they have to do is Item Restoration if they got rid of their other one. Why should they give them a completely different item that they didn't loot? This is the equivalent of getting a pair of cloth bracers and wanting a weapon to replace it.</div></div><hr />

Lies. Have you even tried, or are you just BSing without even bothering to check? I scrapped some 340 gear early in the expansion and was able to reclaim it, you just need to have the materials that it lists that was obtained from scrapping in your bags.</div></div><hr />

Ah, then yeah I can't really agree with their decision. Seems pretty arbitrary to retroactively make something a &quot;transmog only&quot; item. Some people will have already used item restore, sold or used the materials from scrapping, etc. They missed the boat and now it's not transmog only...</div></div><hr />

If you have cooldown, just contact support, they've updated that on their Twitter.<br />

Should get your weapon back just in time for the next expansion with how long they take.</div></div><hr />

Timestamp of a few minutes ago, mine is back from 125 up to 355 with fully budgeted stats. Relogging right now to see if it changes again.\<br />
<br />
Edit: relogged and it's still back to how it was before the &quot;hotfix.&quot; Not sure if they are backing off or if mine is just double bugged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't matter if you can restore it, this is unacceptable. I missed my raid time because of this bug. What's more, it's not a bug that should even exist: No one wants the chance to lose out on an upgrade because of transmog. The transmog appearance should just be a rare variation of the weapon at the same item level with a different skin.</div></div><hr />

It's a weapon drop. People looted it. People got the item.<br />
Why the fuck does it now need to be nerfed? Does the weapon having some value cause any issues I'm not seeing? I get that it was dropping off the loot table but they had a long goddamn time to realize this issue before the weapons started to be looted by players.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I'm being unreasonable by expecting more from Blizzard than stuff like this or if this is as inexcusable as it looks. If it was just this that happened then that would be fine, but the myriad of other gamebreaking issues that have happened are increasing the feeling that they were really not prepared for what in truth isn't that huge of an update. It's shit that's been in the game before. They've put cosmetic weapons in the game before. It's not like this is their first go around with these concepts.</div></div><hr />

Here's the thing, if it had been that it was an alternative skin for the mace on all difficulties, that would have been fantastic. If it dropped 355 (N), 370 (H), and 385 (M), that would have been amazing and people would have loved it. &quot;Oh, a rare skin for an item that doesn't give any power that also acts as the weapon in question. Sweet.&quot; Instead, they penalize the players.</div></div><hr />

There are like 3-4 different ways I can think of off the top of my head that would have taken no effort on their part to make this go from a huge idiotic blunder to an awesome feature...like start it out statless so people don't lose a weapon that may have even warforged and been a huge upgrade. Or let people keep the stats on their current one and give a statless one for future kills. Or do as you said and have it be simply a different skin for the same weapon, identical in power.<br />
<br />
That's why this, even in the face of stuff like the M+ caches and Lagfronts and god knows how many other issues this raid release has had, feels like the biggest asshole move so far. They didn't even make an attempt to help the players who'd been screwed over my this change. Either go restore your weapon or suck it up and pray for a loot drop, I guess.<br />
<br />
I'm not one of the people who was affected by this but if I'd gotten it this may be a tipping point for me in this expansion and it likely will be for a lot of people who got it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While yes they had cosmetics in the game before, it was added in Legion, when nobody was changing weapons, so it didn't matter if people were getting them off the loot table. With this being off the loot table, it means people who can use it are getting weapons loads faster than they should be, which is problematic for balance and unfair for those that can't get it. This is the first time they ahve had cosmetic weapons with a separate loot table in the game when changing weapons was viable.</div></div><hr />

Except most people enchanted their new 355 weapon.<br />
Most people scrapped their old, usually 340, weapon.<br />
Most people who did this missed out on raiding, mythic plus, or any progression content because of this.<br />
They aren't asking for more loot than others, and to insinuate this misses the point. People had thought they got a 355 and acted accordingly, which caused them to miss out on loot. Asking for the 355 you believed you had gotten isn't unreasonable, it's asking for Blizzard to make up for their mistake and the potential lost loot. I know, on my end, I missed out on some heroic bosses that I had setup runs for because of this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enchanting it really isn't a concern, that's like 2k gold or something. And yes, they are asking for more loot than others, because they got a weapon from a completely separate roll(whether they knew it or not), meaning they would've had 2-3 chances(3 if they coined too), vs 1-2(2 if coined) for everybody else. Blizzard should've just reset item restoration CD rather than relying on tickets, but they shouldn't have given people new weapons to replace the transmog one.</div></div><hr />

And yes, they are asking for more loot than others, because they got a weapon from a completely separate roll(whether they knew it or not), meaning they would've had 2-3 chances(3 if they coined too), vs 1-2(2 if coined) for everybody else. Blizzard should've just reset item restoration CD rather than relying on tickets, but they shouldn't have given people new weapons to replace the transmog one.<br />
<br />
OK, I missed out on 6 boss kills [N](Zul, Mythrax, G'huun) [H] (Taloc, MOTHER, Fetid Devouerer), which the buddies I had setup the group with were able to clear. That extra chance that you are stating I had cost me, and likely thousands of people in the same situation, up to 9, by your count, chances at loot. The whole scenario that you're thinking about immediately breaks down due to the game not being centered around a single boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that sucks, but you still shouldn't get more loot for the boss you did kill. There's also still 5 days left to kill those bosses, even if it's not with the group you'd intended. Could've also bought a 300 BoE weapon(or done a WQ if one was up) and done worse in the raid but still been useful, especially considering heroic is primarily a mechanics check.<br />
<br />
And again, they should've just reset item restoration CD along with the hotfix going live, that way the problem would've been avoided entirely. You getting the &quot;real&quot; weapon wouldn't allow you to travel back in time to make it into those raids you missed either, so at this point it's irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

- The weapon is too commonly looking and totally unsignificant to have it as special transmog item<br />
- This weapon only had the desirable stats on it, so we have to get our weapons from M+ only which have a low droprate<br />
- Besides the warglaive and AGI 2h (limited classes that use them), there drop at least 2 of any weapon type (2x staves, 2x 1h str, 3x 1h int, 4x 1h agi, 2x ranged, 2x shields, 2 x offhands) Though due to warglaive and AGI 2h this arguement is weak</div></div><hr />

The problem with that is that now you're giving people extra loot just because they got &quot;lucky&quot; and got a transmog item, which is on a separate roll to other loot.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but you can't just declare something crucial to play the game as cosmetic afterwards and make it useless. Players had the same chance to get the regular and the intended cosmetic weapon. With the conversion they do not get an extra piece of loot. They just keep the useful version they got before. The guardian appearance must be removed from them but i'd say no1 gives a fuck about it when he can keep his main weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they didn't have the same chance. The transmog one is a separate roll, just like in Legion. In addition to that transmog roll, they also had the normal loot roll. So yes, they would be getting extra loot they wouldn't otherwise have gotten if they give people the real weapon instead of the transmog one.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, how dare a paying customer have opinions on a product they paid for. I don't get how people are defending the state BfA has released in, there have been numerous large scale bugs, and just in general it's clearly not finished(&quot;didn't have time&quot; to finish multiple specs for one). Conquest being active in week 1 wasn't &quot;1 among millions&quot; either. Neither was the weekly M+ chest giving rewards or people getting PvP rewards based on their rating from Legion. Having to buff multiple trinkets by hundreds of percent as well. At least 1 dungeon achievement being horribly bugged to the point where it requires a DK to un-bug it(or at the start of the expansion a priest, but instead of fixing the bug with the achievement, they made it so priests couldn't fix it)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This weapon dropped for me on Tuesday, as an unholy Dk. I logged on Wednesday to tank some mythic+ with some friends. They hotfixed this item right in the middle of my m+ run. You can't change gear in m+ anymore, not that it really mattered, because I had already scrapped my other weapon. And, as I had already used an item restoration recently, I was unable to get a weapon back to even continue playing after that last run. So here I am, out a weapon, out a key, and unable to play my main or off spec for at least 24 hours while blizzard tries to tackle what must be a large influx of tickets. I'm just happy I play a Dk, and my enchants are free, I can only imagine how pissed someone who dumped a bunch of gold on a weapon enchant would be. <br />

Some people did miss out on raid nights based on the reclaimer cooldown. If the company can track that then go ahead and only compensate those players. If they cant, then give everyone the benefit of the doubt.<br />
Its just a game, let people have fun should be the default.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah and what about other class that cant use a 2H weapon like that?<br />
As an healer you could win this weapon and have your offspec dps weapon at the same time.<br />
<br />
they fucked up on that, but I think its normal and fair to fix it that way</div></div><hr />

My 370 weapon suddnely became a 140 weapon in the middle of a M+, my DPS went from 14K to around 5K. At first I didn't even notice it, I thought I fucked up my rotation over and over and over again. But no... at the last boss I opened my character interface and behold, I was using a weapon that could be considered a green from Legion. I had two 340 weapons in my bags, but no matter, you can't swap gear in M+ anymore!....<br />
<br />
The whole situation was just poorly handled by the Devs. I mean come on. 3 hours later they had a server shutdown, it could have been applied then. Atleast then it wouldn't affect people in the middle of a M+ run.</div></div><hr />

You know this well in advance when you decide to put forth your money. You give them your money with silent demands of perfection with complete disregard to prior events, I’m not defending blizzard, I’m tryin to get y’all to see that you’re the problem. Quit throwing money at a company YOU ALREADY KNOW will not meet your expectations, and getting mad about it. Nobody here cares, and by your attitudes neither does Blizzard. If this, nay, if ANY game pushes you to the point where it ruins your day or you need to threaten people, maybe you need to take a step back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was (and still is) a bug, but our initial response to discovering the issue had unfair consequences for players who had innocently earned and equipped what appeared to be a great weapon. We’re going to revert the change and proceed with a new fix that only lowers the item level of new drops.<br />
<br />
Once this fix is live, anyone who had earned the weapon before our original hotfix should find that it has been restored to its original glory. If you’ve since deleted the weapon after it changed, you can restore it via our CS tools or contact CS directly for assistance.</div></div><hr />

Hey there Commodore,<br />
<br />
Game Master Khwolanghe reporting in. I hope that my message finds you well. <br />
<br />
I see that after obtaining Khor, Hammer of the Guardian, you were a little confused as to why your Prot Paladin received it. Allow me to shed some light where I can here! <br />
<br />
Now originally this hammer was supposed to have the base ilvl of 125 as it was meant to be an item used strictly for transmog, meaning that your Paladin would be eligible for the drop. The higher ilvls it was having was actually a bug to begin with. We implemented a Hotfix to change it from the 355 to the 125. However our stance has since changed on this item and actually it should be Hotfixed again soon and swapped out for the previous version. <br />
<br />
Sadly we don't have a way to remove appearances and this is what appears to have bound it to your character. This means that we won't be able to swap it out. <br />
<br />
I do apologize for the confusion here but just to clarify, Khor, Hammer of the Guardian, was originally just meant for transmog, which means any class that equip them item was eligible to loot it. If you have any more questions or concerns about this, please feel free to contact us again. <br />
<br />
Take care and safe travels!<br />
Your friendly neighborhood GM,<br />
Khwolanghe</div></div><hr />

Albeit i still doubt the mental capabilities of the same person who thought it would be a good idea to have the same boss drop both:<br />
- An actual weapon<br />
- A replica with no stats or ilvl<br />
<br />
Especially considering how bland and unsignificant the weapon in question is.</div></div><hr />

Pay attention. Learn to read. It’s no longer a mog item, again. I know it’s hard to keep up with Blizzard’s nonsense, but if you are going to get involved at minimum make an effort to read the posts of the person you are critiquing.</div></div><hr />
