It's time to talk about another addon on the front page! With the recent news of AVR and AVRe removal with Patch 3.3.5 I figured it might be the right time to mention HudMap (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/hudmap.aspx). It will probably remind you of AVR in some ways but this addon is different and so far it looks like Blizzard will tolerate it. <br />
<br />
HudMap on Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/hudmap.aspx). <br />
<br />
What is it?<br />
HudMap is an addon that provides a true heads-up tactical display of an encounter, with raid member positions, range data, debuff area-of-effect indicators, and more.<br />
<br />
Additionally, HudMap ships with totem radius indicators. In general, if you want to do range or player-to-player directional stuff, HudMap's your huckleberry.<br />
<br />
Can I use this in to replace AVRe?<br />
Possibly. You can use it in a similar manner, though it definitely takes a very different approach to information display. HudMap is designed to give you proximity awareness of your partymates and areas that are potentially hazardous due to proximity or some other effect that boss mods generally warn you about. In that sense, yes, it's a replacement.<br />
<br />
However, HudMap is not going to let you annotate the world, add additional data over physical locations, or let you draw obscene pictures on Arthas before you pull him. HudMap does nothing to emulate or project 3D data, and never will. Additionally, feature parity is not a goal of the project - some information is better presented in AVR than it will ever be in HudMap, and I'm not going to try to replicate that. Other data will fit HudMap better naturally, and those pieces will be actively pursued.<br />
<br />
Is this addon going to get banned because Blizzard doesn't like AVR?<br />
To head off the inevitable, I've asked Blizzard if this is kosher in light of the AVR breakage. They have not indicated that it is a violation of the rules. Until they indicate otherwise, HudMap will be developed and updated. The impression I get is that Blizzard's primary complaint was with AVR's ability to draw pseudo-3D images over the game world, which is outside of the scope of what the UI was intended to be able to do. HudMap doesn't do any of that.<br />
<br />
Extending HudMap<br />
Have an idea for a range feature? It's easy to implement one. Just see modules\example.lua for a simple framework upon which you can build your own modules.<br />

<br />
Let's socialize!<br />
We're at the end of a very long and very calm week-end and we all reached the point where we just need more people to hug. If you're not into hugs, it's also a wonderful opportunity to start working on a plan to take over the world. <br />
<br />
That's why I finally created a Facebook fan page for MMO-Champion! Technically we already had a MMO-Champion group but I couldn't do much with it, the fan page might actually let me do a few interesting things. <br />

<br />
On a slightly more personal level, I also decided to create a Twitter account and fight my fear of social networking. It will probably take a few days to get used to it but it looks like there are also a couple of fun things to do with Twitter. <br />

Sure looks like it's drawing images over the UI to me. I can't see what the big difference is? This is giving a visual indication of buff/debuff zones that the UI doesn't give.. surely this is just as likely to be banned as AVR.</div></div><hr />

Really? You might want to go read some of the discussion on how trying to judge distances from other players in this game with basically no frame of reference is in no way fun or intuitive gameplay. Trying to guestimate how far away you need to run from other players before dropping you stacks of instability isn't exactly fun. <br />
<br />
&quot;Oh no. DBM still shows one player in range of me. But I'm sure I ran as far as last time! Oh, our ret pally DCed on the stairs again... I better run left. Is that far enough? Nope, DBM is still pinging. God damnit, how the hell am I supposed to judge distances in the 3D world when players are standing on stairs and I'm using a 2D monitor?!?! There we go, finally out of-&quot;<br />

The game is always being geared to the casual, i understand the reasoning behind that on blizzards part. i do. The game requires most classes to sit and spam a rotation watching for proc's while following the most basic rule of raiding &quot;Don't stand in -Blank-!&quot;. So now we have add-ons that explain the boss fight as it happens, one that tell you what your ration should be, and that one the other week &quot;paint-by-numbers-raiding&quot; i can't recall the name. It seems to me if you need all these addons to play, you might as well just hire someone else to play, or watch a fantasy movie, or uninstall and watch other people raid on youtube...<br />
<br />
There are more &quot;Play for you&quot; addons then the 3 i mentioned, i just think they are getting a little bit excessive.</div></div><hr />

My point was that it turns a stupid and unintuitive guesswork job into something manageable and much more intuitive. If you're good at guesswork and estimating distances based on the limited data provided by the default UI, then this addon is fairly pointless for you and won't make a difference. Otherwise, this addon is yet another bar/meter/whatever that you have to pay attention to during your raid. It might even make raiding harder, but at least you won't have to guess at it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">feroid</div><div class="date">2010-06-01, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, this addon will be banned.<br />
<br />
Just to be clear, there's a difference between a mod telling you what needs to happen versus showing you. AVR takes the pitch, yaw and roll (if you will) of your character to visually represent where you need to be and when. That's very distinct compared to a tool like DBM playing a &quot;run away little girl&quot; sound file when you're in a danger spot. It's not visually showing you in the 3D game space where to run to get out of danger.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure HudMap crosses that line.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">prince0gotham</div><div class="date">2010-06-01, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the other hand this pretty much tells us that they'll always think of something else.

<br />
PS. For those of you saying it needs to be banned or will be banned for doing the same thing as AVR keep in mind the key difference here... This addon draws its information to the USER INTERFACE in the style of a small birds eye view map where AVR drew directly onto the 3D GAME WORLD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That &quot;guessing&quot; that you're so worried about is referred to as &quot;understanding the fight&quot; and &quot;having skill&quot;. If you lack skill, you're gonna blow up your team, not move fast enough or in the wrong direction, etc. Part of skill is situational awareness. AVR/E and HUDMap remove almost all the necessity for the player to use situational awareness.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'll be quoted and numerous comments will be made about skill and not needing it for [insert boss fight], but before anyone hits the post button on such a reply, try to think about when you first started raiding (in WoW or any other MMO) and remember how much you knew and how aware you were of EVERYTHING happening in raid boss encounters.<br />

PS. For those of you saying it needs to be banned or will be banned for doing the same thing as AVR keep in mind the key difference here... This addon draws its information to the USER INTERFACE in the style of a small birds eye view map where AVR drew directly onto the 3D GAME WORLD.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's issue with AVR was not solely that it drew on the game world. In fact, that was only a small part of the issue. They're biggest concern was the fact it drew visual range checks at all, regardless of it being on the game world or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would like to see the source or reference to this claim. Because as far as I have read from blue posters their ONLY complaint was the fact that the user interface was being manipulated to react in a manner that was not intended.</div></div><hr />

AVR used the current camera position, something other addons don't use - removing this function was what was done to break AVR.<br />

Just to be clear, there's a difference between a mod telling you what needs to happen versus showing you. AVR takes the pitch, yaw and roll (if you will) of your character to visually represent where you need to be and when. That's very distinct compared to a tool like DBM playing a &quot;run away little girl&quot; sound file when you're in a danger spot. It's not visually showing you in the 3D game space where to run to get out of danger.<br />
HUDMap does the same thing AVR does just from a top-down angle instead of drawing on the game world.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Before someone tries to play superhero LUA Man, I'll clarify what I said here: HM does the same thing that AVR does just in a different way.</div></div><hr />

BLIZZ i beg you, break it along with DBM and omen and any other alike addons... i really want to see EJ kids failing on something as simple as threat management or ppl saying &quot; omg i dont have DBM anymore, i didnt know i have debuff!!&quot;<br />
Besides making pve slightly harder you would actually expose pseudo pros who think that after installing few addons and reading few ej topics they are pros<br />
<br />
<br />
But where does it end ?<br />
<br />
If you break DBM, people will simply use something like Power Auras to indicate certain debuffs. <br />
Want to break that too ?<br />
<br />
A lot of people also forget that boss encounters have evolved with the idea people use certain addons.<br />
You are all talking about the glory of vanilla where you didn't have such luxury. Well newsflash people, fights were much less complex.<br />
<br />
I mean take a fight like saurfang. You are expected to have 15-20 people spread out on a relative small platform and stay at least 13 yards apart to counter blood nova. Blizzard knows this is trivial because nearly everyone has a range meter. But that kind of simplifies the game in the same way AVR does, yet would removing it really make this fight more &quot;skilled&quot; ?<br />
Should we spent an extra 5 minutes before the fight measuring out ranges on a fight that already has an annoying 2 minute intro. Or should we adjust in mid fight ? Is there skill involved in just standing slightly off center and 1 shotting your marked neighbor with a blood nova ?<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
I've always felt 2 sided about these kind of addons.<br />
<br />
On one side they really make things easier. I've used AVR for a while now, not because i can't do without. But it simply makes things and ranges easy to judge. I know most of the people who oppose it are using it too. <br />
And personally I'm rather glad this addon goes away.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, isn't AVR anything more than a glorified /range meter ?<br />
Is there really less skill involved than checking a box with names compared to a circle on the ground ?<br />
Is there really less skill involved compared to stepping sideway from someone yelling: &quot;Malleable Goo on Me&quot;, compared to a red circle around said person ?<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
On the topic of the new addon.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if i'm going to use it. Nor would i see a reason for blizzard to allow it. It's the same as AVR only from a top down view so to say.<br />
<br />
The main reason I'm doubting though is that the addon really seems to cluster*#$% the middle of your screen.</div></div><hr />

Unless hudmap tells you where and when to run, no it doesn't.<br />
<br />
as far as I can tell.. it's a graphical range indicator with no points of reference or guides that tell you where or when to move.<br />
<br />
HUDMap you still have to think. AVR told you where to move when Icetombed.<br />
<br />
Ever used /range 12 in dbm? Yeah it's that but graphical. AVR doesn't do the same thing as HUDmap.</div></div><hr />

That is not true. Until recently the GetPlayerMapPosition function simply did not work inside Instances. What they would kill however are functions like the DXE Rangecheck (showing the exact distance calculated using coordinates).</div></div><hr />

Sure. What about just disabling the function while in combat? I'm not suggesting they should do it; but they could, if they decided that HudMap crosses the line too.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't interfere with gameplay at all. It takes a person's gear, adds up the ilvl and spits out a number. The addon isn't the problem, which has been stated ad naseum, and yet people still blame the addon and its author. Without GearScore people will turn BACK to wow-heroes.com which is what was most widely used prior to an ingame addon being around.</div></div><hr />

1) Ban an addon's name (Simple rename folder+toc file to get it working again)<br />
2) Remove an API function that the addon needs to function<br />
<br />
There is no option<br />
3) Fire their pewpew lazorz at the addon<br />
<br />
Option 2 was what was used against AVR - they removed the API that provided the user's camera angle which AVR used to position its frames.<br />
Gearscore, on the other hand, only inspects players on mouse over. This is not a feature that can be removed (as it would break all inspect addons).<br />
Then it takes the item levels and adds them using some kind of algorithm (don't tell me you want to remove LUA's ability to do calculations).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Drawing on the &quot;UI&quot; was never the problem. If that were the case, just about any CD tracker such as PowerAuras or NeedToKnow would have been banned years and years ago. It's drawing on the &quot;World&quot; that they have a problem with, especially things that other people can see, like AvR.<br />

If you break DBM, people will simply use something like Power Auras to indicate certain debuffs. <br />
Want to break that too ?<br />
first you need to configure all auras and PA wont show your threat level or when boss is going to use an ability.<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of people also forget that boss encounters have evolved with the idea people use certain addons.<br />
You are all talking about the glory of vanilla where you didn't have such luxury. Well newsflash people, fights were much less complex. no i'm not, im just tired of seeing people who think they are awesome while they would fail on easiest task w/o addons . Pve is easy as it is(o and dont come up with the LK25HM bullshit... 1 fight =/= whole content), with more and more addons it will be just grindy. Imo dbm, omen, avr or the shit from this news is just making pve boring. I like the chellenge when im playing, otherwise i dont even feel that im playing...<br />
<br />
ps. gl finding a guild if you write in application that you wont use dbm or omen xD<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean take a fight like saurfang. You are expected to have 15-20 people spread out on a relative small platform and stay at least 13 yards apart to counter blood nova. Blizzard knows this is trivial because nearly everyone has a range meter.

<br />
<br />
Should we spent an extra 5 minutes before the fight measuring out ranges on a fight that already has an annoying 2 minute intro. Or should we adjust in mid fight ? Is there skill involved in just standing slightly off center and 1 shotting your marked neighbor with a blood nova ?<br />
is there skill involved in following an addon? i dont think so. If you have to learn the range yourself, it takes more from a player and thats pretty obvious. <br />
Playing without addons is always harder and requires mroe from a player and no matter what you say, you wont change that. <br />
Also will those 5 minutes really kill you if you can clear whole new content in a week anyway? just to farm it for next couple of months until new content arrives... clear it in a week and farm it for another couple of months while waiting for new content that will take 1 week to clear again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Recount, rating buster, auctioneer, needtoknow, omen...etc. are all addons that are used to make life a bit easier in WoW; to save some time so you can spend it on other things.<br />
<br />
Which addons each and everyone decides to use is up to each person. So if you think it's retarded to use for example RaidBuffStatus to look for slackers in the raid then DON'T install the addon! But don't complain about the people who DO want the addon. I won't affect you anyway.</div></div><hr />

i'm not sure the extent of the blocking mechanism, but try running fb on the secure server (https), that works for me at school. The only hassle is that you need to copy paste the adress every time you navigate to a new page and add the s to http.<br />

<br />
1- blizzard accepts such addons, and increasingly make more complex encounters to challenge players with them<br />
2- blizz ban them, and do encounters assuming people do no have such tools<br />
<br />
either way the game difficulty stays the same<br />
mind you none of that of those has anything to do with individual player skill, if wow was a single player game, everyone would be complaining how easy it is.<br />
<br />
wow difficulty always was making large amounts of people work together, which starts even before people put the first step on the instance<br />
<br />
however option 2 does allow blizz way more liberty in making bosses, so lets hope this crap is banned</div></div><hr />

HudMap has the -E builtin. Look at this demo video of the plaguewing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvX1Wa4Nxkk<br />
It looks very much like AVR. But instead of drawing everything on the ground, stuff is now drawn on a virtual map across the screen. Still pretty much trivializing goo explosion on rotface and such.</div></div><hr />

let's face it, ICC range mechanics are stupid. You have 2 sec to get away from invisible fire, if not, you get 1 shoted.<br />
<br />
Range check were there before, take Gruul. But at least, the dmg was increasing as you were closer to someone. Right now in ICC, it's 10 yards away, no dmg, 9.9 yards away you get 1 shoted. really fun right?<br />
Wake up, and tell me you like this range mechanic, and you think it's fun before trying to see if a mod makes a fight that you may not even have done on HC is made easier. <br />
<br />
yes this makes the ICC mechanic easier, but then again, if people need a big fucking warning when they have unchained magic not to cast, and can't LOOK for something there IS ALREADY there, I don't know what to say.</div></div><hr />

I've got news for you after that point NO ONE CARES and the ppl depending upon these addon's will not be the ones going for the world firsts.<br />
<br />
For all those raging already to get blizz to ban the addon, have you even looked at it... its basically a slightly enchanced minimap, doesn't draw/project in the 3d world. and for the ppl thats saying whats next addons that play your class for you, your a bit late to the game they've been around for ages from addons telling u which spell to use next, to addons that show you who needs the most healing first.<br />
<br />
In the end its just a game, in 5-10 years chances are the servers won't be here non of this will be even remembered if you don't want to use the addon's no one's forcing you to. The advantage they're going to give over an experienced player is non existant.<br />
<br />
Personally i wouldn't mind if all raiding addons were removed and we went back to the epic scale of 40man vanilla wow encounters without any warnings and actually having to know the fight.</div></div><hr />

I think the addons are designed so that you can focus on what you have to do as your raid function (heal/dps/tank) and be less handicapped by having no warning whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I mean hell I've failed a couple of times during raids because I was so busy looking what everyone else was doing (Raid Leading is a bitch) that I didn't realise I was standing in a void and, well you know the rest.<br />
<br />
The thing is, the addons can tell you WHERE to stand and WHEN, some people will still fail at the game. Do you seriously need to have AVR to know that you SHOULDN'T stand next to Sindra when she does blistering cold, and you shouldn't hug your icetombed buddies. But funnely enough people still manage to fail on simple mechanics. <br />
<br />
Take Mimiron for instance, how difficult is it to avoid the AoE shock he does ? How hard is it to avoid his missiles ? HOW HARD IS IT TO NOT STAND IN FRONT OF HIM WHEN HE DOES &quot;BARRAGE&quot;, but people still fail at the friggin game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example. I see alot of ppl focused on staying out of HUDmaps circles...that they fail to notice they are running in front of the boss and get cleaved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in both cases, you need to run, the addon isn't gonna make it for you. So the difference is in the warning you have, nothing more.<br />
<br />
Seriously, between AVR that helps on visualizing distances and a buff that gives you 20% more health, more dmg, and more healing, which one makes the game easier?<br />
If you have done some HC, then you know that this buff trivialize the game completely, more than all addons combine.</div></div><hr />

imo this addon looks to do more harm than good, but cba if it's out there, pallypower has been out there forever<br />
and still pallys fail at it.. <br />
<br />
The more addons out there, the more can I expect from those im playing with when pugging on all alts.<br />
<br />
the upside of this addon are also, for those people with bad reaction to actually notice stuff going on, some people are maybe more visual-learning <br />
capabilities than others, when learning boss fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point is that the line of what should and should not be allowed is really blurred. What we are seeing here is evolution of PvE raiding content. Some people desperately try to stop the evolution and cling to what we have.<br />
I have serious doubts that is going to work, there are so many loopholes for this.<br />
Instead blizzard is largely evolving with the game, and it should. <br />
<br />
Back in Vanilla you were watching boss cast bars, keeping an eye on your buffs for procs. And moving out of obvious dangers. There wasn't much more.<br />
Now there are smart fires, there are abilities that 1 shot you if you're even half a yard out of place. There are classes with advanced procs and rotations, there are fights with high mobility where you still need to keep out of range of people. <br />
Unless you are an 8 eyed octopus you can not seriously be expected to keep everything in check.<br />
<br />
Blizzard expects you to react to boss mods instead of doing it vanilla way in most cases. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
people were cappable of spreading out on original onyxia with 40 people around, you really think they need addon to tell them everything?<br />
is there skill involved in following an addon? i dont think so. If you have to learn the range yourself, it takes more from a player and thats pretty obvious. <br />
<br />
Onyxia didn't execute you instantly if you were 1 step to the left though. Onyxia isn't much different from Syndragosa but limited to phase 1 and 2, and without Chill of the Grave on melee and Instability (or whatever the normal version was again) on ranged.<br />
Onyxia had whelps, Syndra has ice tombs. Difference is in the abstract form not so big.<br />
<br />
Sindragosa however DOES have Chill of the Grave, it does have Instability. It does have a phase 3 where a mispositioned can lead to an extra icetomb and possibly a wipe. <br />
<br />
Current day encounters are not exactly trivialized by boss mods in my opinion. AVR largely did, that's why I'm glad its going. But I don't think all PvE addons are bad because of that.<br />
<br />
--------<br />
<br />
Also I totally don't get people who think that this new HudMap is any different from AVR.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless hudmap tells you where and when to run, no it doesn't.<br />
<br />
as far as I can tell.. it's a graphical range indicator with no points of reference or guides that tell you where or when to move.<br />
<br />
HUDMap you still have to think. AVR told you where to move when Icetombed.<br />
<br />
Ever used /range 12 in dbm? Yeah it's that but graphical. AVR doesn't do the same thing as HUDmap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes it does... it does the EXACT SAME.<br />
<br />
Except instead of drawing it out for you in the actual 3D world, it gives you a top down view of where to stand. This is the EXACT SAME THING. As you can see in the example of sindragosa, the player knew exactly where he could stand without getting hit by the frost tomb.</div></div><hr />

You mean like not dying to Festergut pugent blight anymore cauz most melee are over the softcap to survive it just by having 1 spore buff ? :D Yeah I know.<br />
<br />
Still find it funny how some of the people I've raided with can't break 8k with the 20% buff .... Fail players will continu to fail.<br />
<br />
On a side note I've killed Putri10hm with my 4900GS pallytank (I did the abo so I only tanked in P3) it was still faceroll. Thank you 20% buff .... I'm just sad that I took a break and missed out on &quot;normal ICC&quot; It was already at 10%ish when I came back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
btw there are sounds/quotes lines wich tells you ingame without addons that a thing are about happen, addons just translate that into &quot;just move&quot;.<br />
bosses are more complex than they were from beginning, and there were more entusiasm to learn the fights than there are now, people dont learn<br />
as no experienced player tell ingame what to do, everyone is dependent on reading tacts everywhere else cause if they fail once people emoquit<br />
or get kicked, so addons are created to make em not fail on what we who played for years think is easy to know.<br />
<br />
everyone is different and are'nt taught ingame mechanics when they grow up, sometimes the game are totally new for people, and sometimes<br />
addons/programs/chairs/stoves/microwave ovens/laundry machines/cars get developed to do more things than we care about.<br />
and most of the times it makes life easier for them, not all are hardcore and go out and eat from nature cause it's too easy <br />
to buy in supermarkets, same thing as raiding, things gets developt to make things abit easier than before.<br />

<br />
&quot;Just to be clear, there's a difference between a mod telling you what needs to happen versus showing you. AVR takes the pitch, yaw and roll (if you will) of your character to visually represent where you need to be and when. That's very distinct compared to a tool like DBM playing a &quot;run away little girl&quot; sound file when you're in a danger spot. It's not visually showing you in the 3D game space where to run to get out of danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now take the last sentence and change a few minor things:<br />
<br />
&quot;That's very distinct compared to a tool like HUDmap showing a circle around a dot that's representing you when you're in a danger spot. It's not visually showing you in the 3D game space where to run to get out of danger.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
first of all, no one gives a shit that you have done hc modes of icc, half of the world has atleast tried, i have too, and without avr. are you seriously saying that the increasing buff makes it easier than taking away &quot;dodge this shit&quot; moves from the bosses. not until the shit they throw cant cause a wipe or one shot you <br />
<br />
I got the idea from your earlier posts that you were saying that because of the other aspects of heroic modes, its okay to have an addon to trivialize, mallable goos, iceblock radiuses or spreading out in every encounter that needs it. <br />
<br />
HudMap does the same thing as avr, giving visual effect and a visual radius to debuffs etc. and those effects would be there if it would be intended, it'll get taken down for the same reasons as avr i'd guess. <br />
<br />
there was also the example of gruul, that if you did not spread far enough out it wasnt &quot;that&quot; bad, and how ruthless it is now. i think that's only a good thing. i think its way more fun to have these things as &quot;hard&quot; things on bosses, rather than pure enrage timers. i do like the idea of making gear less important, and even when you'd overgear content, you would wipe with sloppy playing.<br />
<br />
my point being, when for example mallable goo is cast at the raid, people should, in my opinion have to dodge them with naked eye, i hope they make more fights where you have to react to things yourself, move alot and act fast. i hope they keep smashing addons making any parts of fights trivial. i see &quot;dodge this shit to stay alive&quot; exactly as important as &quot;heal the main tank&quot; mechanism</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got the idea from your earlier posts that you were saying that because of the other aspects of heroic modes, its okay to have an addon to trivialize, mallable goos, iceblock radiuses or spreading out in every encounter that needs it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
yes actually on 25men I'm saying the 20% buff IS making it took easy.<br />
<br />
why? because you can make mistakes and still make the enrage. <br />
Take Blood Queen, 1 or 2 can die now, and you still make it, because 20% more dmg makes the dps an none issue. <br />
Take PP, yes, p3 is retarded now, you can take goo or flask ( 100% less hit on HC) and STILL make it, because of the dps increase. <br />
You can take MORE healers and make things a lot easier because of this buff. it's retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's just a rangecheck Addon, wont be banned.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but I don't see the difference between this and AVR, other than that it's topdown.<br />
<br />
It shows you exactly where NOT to stand, and where to move. <br />
<br />
Take the sindragosa example. What did AVRE do ?<br />
<br />
It puts circles around the people that have Instability<br />
HudMap has this too (check the fight)<br />
In both cases people can see exactly where to stand, the only difference is that with HudMap you look at a topdown view making it possibly EVEN EASIER! Because top down gives you MORE situational awareness.<br />
<br />
It puts a circle around the person with frost tomb, so that: a) He can move where no one is standing; b) the others can stand right on the edge to get optimal time on the iceblock (to wipe magic buffet)<br />
Lets see; HudMap does this too. <br />
<br />
And I'm pretty sure that on fights like Putricide it will show a big circle around the player who gets malleable goo.<br />
And on Blood Council it draws a circle around everyone when emp. vortex is going to hit.<br />
<br />
AVR and HudMap are the EXACT same in their usage.<br />
The only difference is that AVR draws its stuff in a 3D view, and HudMap shows it top down like a radar with blips on them.<br />
<br />
Just because you can put your TomTom into a 3D view and a top down 2D view, doesn't mean that the thing suddenly is totally different people.<br />
<br />
The only question is whether blizz banned AVR because it draws 2D objects in a 3D perspective.<br />
Or if they banned AVR because it trivializes encounters too much.<br />
<br />
If its the former, HudMap will live on. If it's the latter i see no reason why this shouldn't also be shot in the face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway now is only a range check but it will be able to draw patches on the map as well, like for example where the malleable goo is gonna fall and leave a red circle there so that you wont walk over it and then go away, or even make red circles during the ooze explosion, is very doable with this addon, just need someone to do it tbh :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tools were meant to help people in need. Be it that they are terribad, thats why tools are made so that such people can keep up with good ones. With that logic we can state without a doubt that AVR-E is a very succesfull tool. It proves the ancient truth that people learn more from illustrations then from reading a wall of text without a single picture. A &quot;noob&quot; using this addon does not fail on Putricide's Goo, Sindragosa's Tombs, Saurfang's Blood Nova,Marrowgar's Nuking down Spikes, Council's Shockwave, BQ's air phase Bolts. You may still call him a noob but by the end of the day he does not fail on the boss mechanics so why whine? Its not abaut doing the job &quot;without help&quot;, its abaut actually being capable of doing the job &quot;at all&quot;.

<br />
No, it doesn't do the same thing. The DBM range box only tells you when someone is within x yards of you; if you move without looking, you are not guaranteed to go the right way to get away from them. HUDMap also tells you exactly where that person is positioned in relation to you, allowing you to go the right way every time.</div></div><hr />

Not sure I'll even get it, I got AVR, liked it (although now that it's gone I gotta admit it did affect my game, made me lazy, so in a way it's good it's gone) and now it's gone. It'd suck to get used to HudMap only for Blizzard then to decide break it.</div></div><hr />

AVR used the current camera position, something other addons don't use - removing this function was what was done to break AVR.<br />

They can easily remove raid member positions from the part of the game data available to user created addons and just replace it with a &quot;range to person&quot; indicator.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there a quote from Blizz where this is said? I don't doubt it's true, but I'd just like to have a reference.<br />
<br />
Also, I kinda think it's bad to be designing a game around players having addons installed. IMO, the game should be designed around players using the default UI. If the default UI isn't providing the controls and information that players need beat the encounters, then the UI needs to be updated to provide them. No one should feel that an addon is necessary to successfully complete a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in that sindragosa video, you don't actually pay attention to the 3D game world when those events occur, you look at the 2D representation of it and make sure your dot is outside of the big area.<br />
<br />
I do think it's really going to push that barrier of them declaring what's good and what isn't.<br />
<br />
Right now all healing has devolved to is:<br />
<br />
if debuff I can remove, show blip by persons name bar ... click bar to remove it<br />
if health low, click bar to fill health<br />
<br />
all the positional stuff is paid attention to when some raid warning (or voice on vent) yells at you. Clearly a healer isn't looking at the world and making decisions based on events they see.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so we shall see... this just really sounds like the author is getting by on semantics of the &quot;modifying the 3D world.&quot;<br />
<br />
You still are modifying it by plopping a 2D panel that shows a top down rangefinder.... it's just great that the same semantics that has blizzard removing AVR is what he's using to validate hudmap. LOL</div></div><hr />

Um, all this addon does is rangecheck. Thats all. The only thing it has in common with AVR is the visual rangecheck.<br />

AVR’s primary function was for the RL to draw on the ground to indicate where people needed to stand. THAT was what was making encounters easier and what Blizzard banned it for. All HudMap is doing is adding range-circles to the minimap and moving them to the center of the screen.</div></div><hr />

Thus, telling you where to stand or not, which is exactly the same logic used by AVR.<br />

And according to wowprogress.com, less the 1% of the guilds who have reported their kills to that site, have even killed him. For that matter, 10% or less have even done ANY Heroic 25 man's. <br />
<br />
I can guarantee very few people who post on these boards have accomplished that. I know I am one of them. <br />
<br />
Bottom Line, make the game enjoyable for yourself. If that means making it harder for yourself by not using add-ons, then so be it. But don't get mad if other people do. If you have enough &quot;skill&quot; to not use them, then it should be no problem. Right? <br />
<br />
I cannot agree more on this. <br />
I did every boss in ICC 10 and 25, and most of the hard modes without it. <br />
are the bosses doable without this mod? ofc they are. but the real question is, do YOU have more fun with this addon or not? if you do, then use it. if you don't like it, nobody is forcing you to install it. We just cleared sindy HC today, glad we finally did. so I'm at 11/12 on HC 25, and I DO enjoy the ICC range mechanic 100x better with this mod, yes, you heard me, I'm using a mod because it makes my raids and my game time more fun, not because I can't down a boss without them. That's what people that only do this game as a casual player or not high end raiding can't get. The difference between downing a boss and not liking the fight, or downing the same boss, but see it in a different angle. <br />
The whole discussion about whenever a mod is making a game too easy is stupid, it should be, does it make the game more fun instead. If for you it doesn't and makes you think the addon is moving for you, then by all means, don't install it, but don't make stupid comments like you can do all bosses without any addons. Yeah, those people that say that, they are mostly dpsers, that get healed up if they are about to die by others. When you try to hot up the raid before an aoe comes, try asking a healer if he thinks making it without timers would make it more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I can think of an example of a type of people that could use HudMap. People who play that have brain tumor(s), MS (depending on severity), and even some of the mentally challenged (and no, I am not making fun of them). Oh wait... That's a few examples, sorry.<br />
<br />
Personally, if I ever get back into raiding I wouldn't mind trying HudMap. Just in case your wondering, I fall into the brain tumor category.</div></div><hr />

way too many people would say its fun to have a addon that controls your char perfectly and can do any boss, so they can get all the loot without any problem, at first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
even people clearing 11/12 in 25man HC in 1 night and that almost have BIS 277 gear? I doubt that. ofc those people will mostly lie and say they hate the addon, because their are too proud of their gear and don't think people that can't do a boss without it are not worthy of the loot, and who can blame them, forums is just about Epeen anyway. <br />
I see both side, on one hand, yes, it makes some mechanics easier, and make the loot and game more accessible to the people that can't do it without, but on the other hand, it makes my raid more fun, and more enjoyable than when playing without, even when clearing 10 or 11 hard mode bosses on 25man in 1 night. <br />
<br />
So basically, you have :<br />
-People that think PVE is about clearing 25men content normal mode, where those addons are making a big part of the job for the kill. But lets remember, Blizzard made 25men easy so that everyone can see the content. Hard modes are the PVE world today that require more than pressing 2 buttons and get loot. Those think that it's destroying PVE, when PVE is something else. <br />
<br />
opposite to:<br />
-People that know how to play without a lot of mods, and do a lot of hard modes and see this as free loot for the casuals mod. those people are also against it, because they think too much about their progression, their gear, and their Epeen. <br />
<br />
and also:<br />
-People, the minority, that don't care about those arguments and want something fun to play, and more intuitive than what the normal UI can offer. <br />
<br />
Iwould say those are the general ideas people have when it comes to addons, I guess I'm missing a lot of other opinions that don't fit here, but the conclusion from this is, there is more people against it, because there is more people that play this game as casual, and people that care about loot and their personal Epeen in this game.</div></div><hr />

For me as a healer hudmap takes to much of the space left on my screen imo... how ever I think its time blizzard makes a better visual reference to range if they're continoing with all this silly range mechanics.<br />
<br />
I might use hudmap on my dps characters butt really dont need it that much on my dps as guesstimateing is loads easier when you focus on the game world 100% of the time... rather than having to shift focus to raid frames to keep ppl up.<br />
<br />
btw avr or even avre newer said where to go just where not to go and well ppl manage to stand in big black puddles before so I guess they will manage to stay in a red circle as well.<br />
<br />
11/12hc <br />
oh yeah 20% buff trivalized the bosses loads more than avre ever did..... wonder how 30% will be</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dek</div><div class="date">2010-06-02, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Three things to say about the people saying how addons make the game too easy:<br />
<br />
1) &quot;Omg the addon literally plays the game for you, you just press the buttons it tells you to!&quot; What addon are you talking about? I have yet to see this addon that plays the game for me. I mean, there were some in Vanilla that came close before they cracked down on the API, but since then, all an addon can hope to do is provide you with information you already have in a more usable manner. Blizzard might decide something isn't kosher, but even AVR was not kosher for 3d rendering in the game world, not for telling you range info.<br />
<br />
2) I remember when you had to raid without addons. One boss feared. Another had 2 healers. Man, those fights were SO HARD! No, those fights were boring. And way easier than fights are now from a strategy perspective.<br />
<br />
3) I'm a real man! Hammers are a crutch, I push in nails with my BARE HANDS! TOOLS MAKE THINGS TOO EASY! <br />
<br />
That's what you sound like.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brownin</div><div class="date">2010-06-02, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone who used to be in a cutting edge raiding guild in Vanilla, but basically stopped playing other than to see the new encounters. Who is only reading this site now to get an idea of a greater landscape of the game because people are trying to make me play again because of the Cata alpha this whole argument blows my mind. I hear people complaining all the time how easy the game has got, but there are people in here complaining about how this mod is necessary to get anything done? That's insane?<br />
<br />
To the people saying you can't judge distances/it's not fun/it's unreasonable: Oh hi, you must be new to video games. I'm glad WoW and it's MASSIVE user base was friendly enough for you to make the plunge. Judging distance is an important part of video games, be it 3D platformers where you need judge jump distance, or FPS where you need to calculate rocket trajectory to hit a moving target. As a more real world comparison, have you heard of a little game called pool/billiards/snooker/etc? Man that should would be better if you didn't have to deal with all that judging of distances and angles. There should be an overlay for that too. <br />
Don't worry though, judging distances in 3D can be hard for some people, someday you too might be able to jump on that Gomba in Super Mario Galaxy without running into it.<br />
<br />
To the people saying it's different from AVR because it's not a 3D addon: Sorry, but you character isn't a spaceship. While the game is technically in 3D, there really isn't any Z axis. For most fights you could black out your whole screen except for this addon and no one would notice. Have you people really never tried to zoomed out and looked straight down on your character for an encounter before?<br />
<br />
To the people talking about vanilla and how this is required because raiding is different: Did you even play beyond MC back then? What about spreading out with 40 people for C'Thun? You know, the encounter that created the range check addon in the first place? AVR should would have made moving out of blizzard/rain of fire for Twin Emps/Grand Widow before it ticked on you easier. What about Viscidus? Hell, it would have been helpful for Huhu so you could swap out. Oh man, more than the small amount of guilds might have actually killed Ouro if there was some kind of map for his sand blast. <br />
For all the talk about how much more complicated the bosses are now a days, looking at the time it took guilds to kill bosses it sure looks like they are easier now. Were some things harder then? Yes. Are many things harder now? Yes. Would AVR/HudMap have made things ALOT easier back then? Very yes.<br />
<br />
To the guy saying you can't get rid of this, or gear score: Heh, really? While I realize it wouldn't get rid of the concept completely, you could just no longer have the API pass the item level, which isn't used for anything anyways. You would then need to use some form of a judgment call on a person's gear, since some are slightly more complicated than others. As for not getting rid of the Hud without breaking the world map? Yeah, because they have never protected an API before. That's like saying you can't get rid of decursive because then you couldn't remove debuffs. What, you are going open up a transparent version of the map and try located the coordinates based on where textures are loaded on the screen? Good luck with that.<br />
<br />
<br />
The whole thing weighs pretty badly on my decision to start playing again. The game is still full of the same people who think they are hot shit, but would fail majorly at any other game they would try to play competitively. Not surprising really, with so many people playing , and so many more playing as their first real multiplayer game it's to be expected. I guess we shall see with more play in the alpha, as it seems you will be able to basically cut yourself off from the riffraff if you really wanted. Or hey, I can just continue to be productive with my free time.</div></div><hr />

All movement in WoW (sans flight) is in 2d. A 2d representation is all you need to figure out where you need to be. I love all the people saying that AVR is 3d = bad, while saying HudMap = 2d just fine. These were the same people that said AVR was no different then DBM; just looking for an excuse to cheat, imo. 2d is all you need because those are the only 2 dimensions you can utilize.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So yay! Here's my first post<br />
<br />
Add-on (taken from Wiki):<br />
an optional computer hardware or software component that, if installed, significantly supplements or enhances the functionality of the original unit.<br />
<br />
1. Optional<br />
2. Enhances<br />
<br />
The problem with the debate on this thread is that some people are saying that the add-on actually does not enhance the gameplay for them but seem to fail to understand that it is 100% optional. It seems as though these people know that using the add-on might give some raiders an advantage, and that they might be forced to to get the add-on themselves if it was true. It's truly a competitive way of thinking, but sometimes you should just let go and clam down.<br />
<br />
Here's another way to think about it :<br />
<br />
If you enjoy the game even more with the add-on, even if it's a bot that does everything for you, then by all means go for it. There are different ways of entertaining yourself, and HUDmap might be one of them for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The biggest problem with you're analogy's is that in fps you have a sett cam distance, same goes for irl but here you also have real 3D not 3d drawn 2d.<br />
The vanilla and tbc encounters where a lot more forgiving on range these days you risk causing a wipe by standing one step to far left/right/whateva (without any graphics really telling you you should not stand there. (voids/fires/etc) On top of this its not just spread for one person some fight require 25 ppl to spread exact distances from each other within a second. <br />
I'm no supporter of hand holding like dbm or avre but the range ring on avr makes judging the distance so much more intuitive as you get a actual in-game reference to what say 10y is with you're current cam.<br />
<br />
How ever I do expect ppl saying everything in vanilla was easy. newer did the bosses you mentioned.. but tbh compared to the mechanics today cthun isn't really that hard. <br />
<br />
Also keep in mind the raiders that have raided since vanilla or even tbc has loads more skills now (exceptions confirm the rule). so even if encounters where the same, theyd be &quot;easyer&quot; for the &quot;hardcore&quot; raiders than they where just because of experience.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Honestly, if you don't like your ability to avoid fires and etc. tested, YOU DO NOT LIKE RAIDING IN WORLD OF WARCRAFT. Why would you play a game that you don't like? There are plenty of games out there that don't involve dodging fires/slimes/judging distances! No one is forcing you to raid. You can use the AH or collect pets or wear interesting RP outfits around town. Or something.<br />
<br />
There is a HUGE difference between things like AVR-E (and maybe this add-on, not quite sure yet) and a tool. I mean, let's be honest here. I know Blizzard employees take addons into account when they design encounters to an extent, but do you REALLY think they sat down and said, &quot;okay, now we want Putricide to cast a spell that checks if the player's AVR or HUDMap is loaded&quot;? No, I think they designed those encounter mechanics hoping that you'd like, you know, use that cool addon called &quot;your eyes&quot; (&quot;located conveniently in the front of your head!&quot; -TRH) to see the indicators that THEY placed in the in-game world as an indication of what to look out for.</div></div><hr />

This would not disable gearscore. Bypassing this change is as simple as dumping 2 columns from any item database, loading it to the addon, and using it to map items to it's item level.</div></div><hr />

I wonder how people would feel if it was confined to the normal mini map space, and the circles pulsated or flashed instead of being solid.<br />
<br />
You could still see the range checks, just not everything around you for 40 yards, and it won't be as blatantly obvious.<br />
<br />
I feel this addon will be banned either way for it's striking similarity to &quot;AVR+E in 2D&quot; but it's just a thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your camera is just as fixed in WoW as it is in any platformer. Just leave it at a constant level of zoom and you are fine. Your brain has a neat little trick where it calculates distance by comparing the size of two objects, characters are standardized heights, making this easy. Again, basic video game skills here.<br />
<br />
Also, how is C'Thun any less strict in terms of distance? You could have someone standing in the wrong spot, or get unlucky with a tentacle spawn and have someone get punted into a bad position and lose 1/4 of the raid to the eye beam. Were you working on the boss when he was new? Do you have any idea how many people died simply running into the fight and trying to get set up?<br />
One could also argue that raiding is less strict now. Damage done by bosses in 40 man Naxx at level 60 was the exact same for nearly everything as it is in 10 man at level 80, the only difference being health pools were tiny back then. As an example, at first on Grand Widow many melee dps had to chain drink fire protection pots to lower the chances of being oneshot from the poison volley and rain of fire at the same time. 4H was a nightmare with all the 'instant death' sources of damage. Most people who play now a days really have no idea what people went through back then, and get all their information by running the 'easy' 40 man instances with the new gear and talents. <br />
That said, I'm definitely not here to debate what raiding was harder when. I really don't care, and I said before, both have their points.<br />
<br />
<br />
This would not disable gearscore. Bypassing this change is as simple as dumping 2 columns from any item database, loading it to the addon, and using it to map items to it's item level. <br />
Yes, as I said it won't get rid of the concept behind gear score, because obviously you can't. It would just make it even more unreliable than it is now. No, you could not just dump two columns from an item database. Those databases are created from the game files. If there is no more item level stored then it's not that simple. You could either give each tier of gear it's own score manually, or try to weigh each stat for each class and try and create some formula to do it. I'm sure people would do both of those. However, by doing this is makes things not as easy to standardize, and more of a hassle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't know if the author of HUDMap still has it up on his page or not, but at one time not too long ago he stated that he used AVR/AVRE code as his foundation for the addon. <br />
<br />
<br />
No it's not. <br />
<br />
The code now used in HudMap was actually part of SexyMap for quite some time now. It's a feature that's been part of SexyMap for the last year or so ... you would press a binding key and it would come up with a HUD with arrows towards gatherer/gathermate nodes. A few months ago he started pulling out that code to put in a separate addon. He uploaded his first public version of the addon 10 days before the AVR/AVRE ban thread drama.<br />
<br />
Now I know Antiarc and he's not the sort of person to use someone else's code in his addons. He's a big fan of writing his version of things and I don't believe he would steal code for his addons.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And also, why does MMO give so damn much attention to those f*cking addons like AVR and now this one? You getting paid by the authors or what?<br />
<br />
<br />
Erm.....no ?<br />
<br />
Why is it when people have a diametrically different opinion than you people accuse the other person of being paid off or bribed by the makers ???<br />
<br />
Why can't he just make a post about it because he feels it's &quot;super cool!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's sort of like your saying the other guy's opinion is so ridiculously retarded and unintelligent and wrong that someone MUST of paid him to say it</div></div><hr />
