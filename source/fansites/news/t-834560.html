How can you possibly think so? Look at the DPS piece: they took 20 str, 20 mastery and added and yellow socket with a +10 str bonus. If you use a str/mastery rare cut you get all your &quot;removed&quot; stats back, plus an extra 10 str. If haste is better for you than mastery (unholy DKs) you can choose to get haste instead and still get the extra 10 str. If str is *much* better for you than any yellow stat you can just take a +40 str gem and sacrifice the mastery (and the bonus). It's a win all around. For the tanking and healing pieces just substitute the appropriate stat. Every single one of the changes provides a gem that will precisely replace the missing stats and give you an extra +10 of something in bonus stats. It's a (small) upgrade in every single case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is datamined. It is not entirely accurate. Wait for official patch notes before you get all emo and cut your wrists over a nerf that doesn't even happen because it's datamined.<br />
<br />
Again, wait for actual patch notes.<br />
Also, to the person QQing about gear losing stats in order to gain a socket... if you checked all gear with sockets, each socket eats up a total of 40 stats each, but thats ok because you can customize which gem you can put in there, plus socket bonus. You'll come out ahead. Did you really think you were going to get a free 40 strength plus socket bonus? Never going to happen.</div></div><hr />

Ah well 104 left and we are at 0.<br />
<br />
I think us priests should wait for the official notes to come in a few days. The priest datamined changes just seem a little wonky and I'm not ready to believe them 100% quite yet.<br />
<br />
However, given the notes are true, I actually like the change to chakra. First, they seem to still be extending its length to 60 seconds. Instead of the chakra stance being extended with the correct spells being cast, the cooldown is now lowered, allowing us to basically switch stances MUCH quicker than before, which will be awesome. We had to wait 30 seconds every time beforehand, now that cd has the capability of being reduced by 100% or more. An awesome change for holy priests.<br />
<br />
I'm praying that the CoH radius change is a mistake though. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do I have to keep up with this chakra crap only to be penalized in the end. I mean if I go into AoE chakra, let my heals feel powerful - more powerful as any other healers - that why it's there. I mean healing without any chakra state right now is bad. Or give every other healer a mechanic like chakra to fight it.</div></div><hr />

The meta was always +1% SBV - the tooltip incorrectly stated 5%.<br />

The stats were reduced on crafted epics by a small margin and replaced with a socket and small appropriate socket bonus. Ultimately, this means a slight buff to all of them.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what game you are playing but fire mages are currently the highest mage dps spec by a long way and it looks like it is getting boosted by the patch notes. Arcane is pretty much dead right now, it is 25-30% behind fire on every boss in the game. I am blue in the face telling our guilds mages to stop speccing arcane for raids, some of them have been enjoying their 2 button spec for so long I don't think they remember how to play anything else.</div></div><hr />

Oh, well. Looks like some interesting games on the horizon. I've heard really good things about Rift.

Why do I have to keep up with this chakra crap only to be penalized in the end. I mean if I go into AoE chakra, let my heals feel powerful - more powerful as any other healers - that why it's there.

* Mind Blast damage has been increased by 60%. Now deals [ 1617 to 1709 ] damage, up from [ 1028 to 1086 ].<br />
* Mind Sear damage has been reduced by 30%. Now deals [ 104 to 113 ], down from [ 146 to 158 ].<br />
* Shadow Orb Power now Increases the damage done by your Shadow Orbs by 11.6%, down from 21.6%.<br />
<br />
1. Only light on the horizon from an SP's point of view...MB will be increased...sweet...more single-target power...just what we needed...not!!!!<br />
2. Could've sworn, from a previous set of patch notes, that Mind Sear was being increased by 15%...now it's being lowered...again? Blue previously said that they thought that the AoE for SP's was too low...now they don't? Get a grip on reality Blue! You turned us from a valid CC toon in Wrath, to a CC nerf queen. Sure, our single tgt power is up, but who has crowd control now days? Surely not the warlocks and not us, the previous CC go-to-toons.<br />
3. Explain this one: Orb power increases damage by 11.6%, down from 21.6%? What was it before? 0% and now 11.6%, which is certainly down from 21.6%; or was it 9.9%, and now it's 21.5% which is still down from 21.6%...by a whopping .1%? I mean, how can 11.6% INCREASE power down from 21.6%? Is this the new math they're teaching? Without digging through past posts, and logging into the game, which I can't since I'm at work right now, this is rather confusing.</div></div><hr />

what on earth is wrong with these people why would they nerf Mind sear and shadow orb power?!<br />
<br />
10 minutes after they buffed it. How the hell do you buff Orbs by 11+% per Orb and then butcher it to 1.6% increase. That shows me someone doesn't really know what they are doing. Was considering reforging into Mastery, but it just slipped back into uselessness (is that even a word?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are reducing the stats by 20, the value you could get back by placing a hybrid, but now they also have socket bonuses so if your going after the primary stats, ( which most of the bonuses were except the tank gear) you would get more now then you would have before.<br />
They did good on the leatherworking using red sockets on the caster gear so you could just throw in a pure int and half of them have 10 int bonus.<br />
I'll admit the BS gear doesn't look as good. the healer belt your either going to have to lose the 20 spirit or the 20 int, you can't make up both losses, though I guess the best thing you would throw in is orange int hybrid and get the other 10 int. <br />
The tank stuff also looks a little weird, looks like they want tanks to use stam hybrids, they can make up the parry and mastery losses with those and get the bonus, but then lose out on the strength, but as far as I know tanks only used strength for threat except DK who got a small amount of parry from it. <br />
The plate dps are fine they can just throw in a orange to get the same stats back they lost, so they are effectively gaining the socket bonus to their gear.<br />

This information is actually incorrect. In addition to Circle of Healing receiving a 30% healing buff, its radius (around the target) is also being increased from 15 yards to 30 yards in patch 4.0.6.

<br />
Why do you want your priest to be just like the other healers? I really like how priests stand out from the crowd with the new chakra mechanic and from how it was designed, you honestly should never be out of either healing chakra stance during a raid, so healing outside of chakra state is a moot point. If your uptime for both stances combined isn't over 90% on a single fight, then you're doing something wrong IMO.<br />
<br />
The proposed changes to reducing the chakra cd instead of enlongating the current stance will help you switch stances so much quicker to adjust to what the fight is giving you. Given your throughput is high enough, you can theoretically even switch from raid healer to tank healer in the middle of a fight if needed.</div></div><hr />

I know with absolute certainty that if you ever became a game developer, you wouldn't think to call them incompetent. Your own ignorance deludes you.<br />
<br />
That you would even try to defend what they did with professions deserves a /boggle.<br />
Jesus where to start.<br />
-enchanting- level 475 recipe requiring a level 515 item that isn't learned until level 525, yea that's an indication of real competence isn't it.<br />
-no gem slots in epic crafted gear, that is changed 5 weeks after ex pac release, yea that's an indication of real competence isn't it.<br />
-alchemy-only 1, yes that's right 1 epic trinket that's itemized for tanks, yea that's an indication of real competence isn't it.<br />
- all crafted blues being pvp recipes, yea that's an indication of real competence isn't it.<br />
<br />
There's much more but there really is no point in trying to convince people who are delighted to spend their money on Blizzard games regardless of the quality of said games.<br />
At one point in time Blizzard would have delayed the release to fix these kinds of things. That is no longer true and anyone who is reasonable can see this.<br />
<br />
edit: oh and the one I really love agility, expertise trinkets that procc off RANGED attacks, lol. But yea keep on defending them. If it isn't incompetence it's laziness combined with contempt which might be better......I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyday I'm more and more happy that I keep my subscription up and running. This expansion has been nothing but the greatest in WoW for a qute a few years. Great quests, great new zones and they are bringing everything closer to perfect with balancing the game and classes and fixing broken stuff. It's nice that Blizzard is so close to it's WoW players and that they love the game they develop.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blazara</div><div class="date">2011-01-20, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, so I think there's a big problem here with how people are reading these changes. Numeric changes are based off the LAST PATCH NOTES FROM THE PTR. Not from Live. So if say, first PTR patch notes buffed Mind Sear to +100% damage, then a little while later there was another PTR patch that buffed Mind Sear another +100%. The total buff to Mind Sear at that point is actually 200%. Then today there's a patch note saying &quot;Mind Sear nerfed by 33%&quot;; that nerf is based off of the 200% existing improvement. In this hypothetical situation the Mind Sear Spell would still be doing 100% more damage than it does on Live. So lots of the buffs and nerfs you see right now are second or third adjustments. Unless you've been paying attention to the whole chain of Buffs/Nerfs you probably don't know how the current changes relate to numbers on Live. A spell getting nerfed right now might still be a lot better than it is on live, likewise a spell being buffed right now might be less powerful than it is on live even after the buff. <br />
<br />
TL;DR: Save your rage for the final Live patch notes. Those will show actual buffs and nerfs relative to current Live content.<br />
<br />
You've actually got your maths wrong, if we take what you said - &quot;the notes are based off the previous PTR notes. &quot; to be true. <br />
If we imagine Mind Sear does 100 damage on live.<br />
PTR 1: Buff by 100% -&gt; 200 damage<br />
PTR 2: Buff by 100%: Under what you say, this would lead to the damage increasing to 400.<br />
<br />
And then in your case, a 33% nerf -&gt; 266.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It´s not that they don´t care. The skills of their devs are just terrible, and their QA department populated by blind idiots.. I mean the lead systems designer is a......... wait for it..... Marine biologist!!!!!! I´m pretty sure Blizz hire the cheapest possible morons they can. <br />

Oh, well. Looks like some interesting games on the horizon. I've heard really good things about Rift.

It can't be nerfed atm, it's the second worst AoE in-game and we shadowpriests are suffering for it since some fights requires heavy AoE, which leaves a shadowpriest out. Take Cho'gall as an example.<br />

yes i think.. history of Mind sear on PTR is...<br />
we know dmg is to low.. <br />
next patch = Mind sear +60% dmg<br />
next patch = Mind sear +can be placed on friendly target (maybe +15% dmg ?? but only maybe)<br />
next patch = Mind sear -30% dmg<br />
<br />
so Mind sear is buffet on PTR by 30-45%dmg more then on live server.. if i read history of patch notes corectly...:confused:</div></div><hr />

..Which still makes it a pretty bad AoE-ability. I do more damage singletarget than AoE at the moment. Oh well, we'll see what happens when it goes live. I like that they buffed Mind Blast at least, was really needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they burst from the beginning not even letting the tank (warrior, pally or else) get aggro on the mobs, then it might not be a tank problem, it might be the DPS that doesnt know how to play and don't understand other classes and all the mechanics of that game (charge mechanic, aggro etc...). If they catch up to you after letting you get aggro then it's not the DPS though :)<br />
<br />
That said A LOT of people only pushes button FOR MAX DPS.......until they die ...and then blame it on the tank/healer. You don't want to play with them :)</div></div><hr />
