Cataclysm Mounts - Drakes of the Wind, Stone Drakes, and Camels<br />
Mounts didn't get a lot of love on the front page since the beginning of the beta. A lot of stuff was implemented in-game during the latest beta update and we now have a decent idea of what to expect in-game. I tried to restrict it to the mounts that we will most likely see in-game, more recolors are available but they aren't always linked to an item, etc ... Let's keep it simple for the moment.<br />
<br />
This is not a complete list of all the mounts added to the game with Cataclysm, I'll do that a little later when most of them are added to the game. <br />
<br />
Drakes of the Wind<br />
The only known drop location is the Reins of the Drake of the East Wind (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/62901/reins-of-the-drake-of-the-east-wind/) rewarded from Glory of the Cataclysm Raider (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4853/glory-of-the-cataclysm-raider-wip/) achievement. <br />

<br />
Stone Drakes<br />
Only 2 stone drakes seems to be implemented for the moment, the only known drop location is the Reins of the Volcanic Stone Drake (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/62900/reins-of-the-volcanic-stone-drake/) from the Glory of the Cataclysm Hero (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4845/glory-of-the-cataclysm-hero/) achievement.<br />

<br />
Camels<br />
Last but not least, camels! Absolutely no idea where they are from, but they will most likely be linked to Uldum. <br />

Crowd Control spells cast time increased to 2 sec<br />
Pretty much. The crowd control spells were never designed around the existence of haste. Asking anyone to interrupt a 1.1 second Polymorph isn't reasonable. Health pools are going to be a lot larger, so control is going to play a larger role than burst compared to the live environment. On the other hand, dispels are more expensive in Cataclysm and you can waste a dispel now if there is nothing there to dispel.<br />
<br />
So I'm right in my sentiment that, instead of correcting haste affecting utility spells, we now all get to suffer even further exacerbated haste dominance?<br />
I never follow this line of thinking. Yes, making it harder to have a [very fast] cast time requires more haste. But you have to make a big trade off for that haste, such as having a lower crit chance for your damage spells. That seems like a reasonable enough trade off that you'll at least have to consider it.<br />
<br />
You can argue that haste is over-valued in PvP because of the risk of interruption, which is much less of a big deal in PvE. Therefore making the cost per stat of haste higher in PvP seems perfectly reasonable. I wouldn't call that &quot;exacerbated dominance.&quot; I'd say it's adjusting it to its actual value in PvP compared to other stats. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560497094/polymorph/))<br />
<br />
Buffs improvements in talents<br />
There is no difference between &quot;talents that increase potency of buffs&quot; and &quot;talents that increase range of buffs&quot;. In both cases you must spend talent points to bring a buff up to par with something other classes offer. In both cases, the baseline buff has something about it that's inferior. So if there's some sort of difference that I'm missing here, please share with the class. No one else can see the difference either.<br />
That's not our definition. If you bring an 8% attack power buff and someone else brings a 10% attack power buff, then the other guy will generally be more desirable. If you have an 8% attack power buff but a talent that brings it up to 2% (and only that), then you have a talent you probably don't want to spend and feel dumb spending whenever the 10% guy isn't around. This is the case with many talents in Lich King, such as Improved Blessing of Might. These are the class of talents that we said we would remove (and then proceeded to do so).<br />
<br />
Once you get beyond the buff itself, there are a variety of ways it is produced by a character. Sometimes it's a base spell. Sometimes it's a talent. Sometimes it's a passive aura. Sometimes it's a proc. Sometimes it goes away when the dude dies. Sometimes it lasts for a duration. We're not interested in making all of these parameters identical, and we think the game would suffer from a pervasive sameness were we to do so. We also think most raiders are sensible enough not to disqualify someone because his buff isn't produced in the absolute most convenient way possible. &quot;Our dps would go up 2% if we had 10% attack power instead of 8% attack power&quot; seems like a reasonable sentiment. &quot;Our dps would go up if the range on this buff were longer&quot; seems like you're really down in the weeds of things to actually worry about.

Goblins &amp; Worgens DK on Beta<br />
Both goblin and worgen will be unable to finish the DK starting zone until we get back to it and add the goblin/worgen &quot;Special Surprise&quot; quests. Until then you'll be stuck. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560507777/death-knight-lvl-57-no-quests-no-npcs/))<br />

Rhumba removed from the game<br />
We were sad to see this talent go, because we thought it was cool too. However, BM just had too many damage-oriented talents, which was preventing those hunters from being able to pick up the utility or fun talents, which in turn violated a major goal of the talent tree revamps.

<br />
Swapping pets<br />
If our pet dies, can we use Feign Death, drop combat, and instantly bring out one of our 5 different pets in that short window of being out of combat in an Arena Match?<br />
No, because you have to dismiss a pet before you can summon a new one. You also need to rez a dead pet before you can dismiss it. It's possible that allowing all of that in combat is fine since it would take so long to actually pull off and in the meantime you could just have rezzed your pet (or healed an injured one rather than dismissing it).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, dismissal no longer affects happiness in any way since the new model is you can swap them more regularly. Your pets just have to learn not to get all emo about it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560767317/ghostcrawler-clarifies-beta-build-12803/))<br />

Lightwell<br />
How to make lightwell work: Change clicking range to 15y, Make clicking it not change target <br />
As I have said previously, this is the plan. We just haven't been able to test it yet, and the talent has enough baggage that it's hard to get players to even try it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560537380/lightwell-changes-build-12803/))<br />

Elemental shamans<br />
Elemental Reach affects all shocks. (Elemental only).<br />
<br />
Totemic Reach increases the range of Searing Totem. (Tier 2 Enhance, so available to all shaman.)<br />
<br />
If you're fighting a shaman with a bunch of Lightning orbs and you're worried about damage, just go hit the shaman. That still removes the orbs.<br />
<br />
Rolling Thunder is 2% mana return, not 1%. <br />
<br />
[...] Yes, we have made further changes to the tree since the build that you have available now. They are predominantly talent changes and not gameplay changes. Earth Shock was the big one. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560867215/shaman-12803-changes-discussion/))<br />

I normally don't do surveys, but this one doesn't ask or require personal/identifiable information from you. So I thought, &quot;Eh, I like pushing buttons anyway.&quot; It was really quick too, had only six simple questions (although I think one was a duplicate).<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: I take that back. Questions 4 and 5 are very similar, but one asks about the past month and the other about the past week.</div></div><hr />

They host the servers that this site is using? Thought that would be good enough reason, unless of course you don't enjoy coming here.<br />

I came. These mounts look spectacular.<br />
<br />
I think they look great too, but you know after first patch in Cataclysm everyone will bag on how bad they look and such just because everyone has one. Either way I think they look great and can't wait to get one. Just curious on how to get the other versions now too so I can just do a random color macro =P</div></div><hr />

With mind numbing poison it will be childplay to do it on fear, cyclone or poly while they are in melee range.<br />
Right now it seems like resto druids don't even have a pushback prot on cyclone, they will only have on heals. Cyclone will be more than 3 sec (nearly 4 sec with 0 haste) if a rogue is on them. Something needs to be changed.<br />

Personally, I have no problem with the longer cast time of polymorph (and other CC spells). Everything will work out ok in the long run, even with a lot more push for CC in instances.</div></div><hr />

However, BM just had too many damage-oriented talents, which was preventing those hunters from being able to pick up the utility or fun talents, which in turn violated a major goal of the talent tree revamps. <br />
<br />
...THE FUCK? I remember you stating VERY clearly, Blizzard, that the goal of these new trees would be to force players to make choices between valuable talents. That, and I think we all agree that firing fucking snakes at your target IS a fun talent in itself.<br />
<br />
...Oh wait. Someone complained that they couldn't get Invigoration and Rhumba in the same build? FIX THAT SHIT HARD /sarcasm<br />

On a lighter note, I came buckets @the drakes. Don't get peoples' whining over the drake designs - the Drakes of the Wind look nothing like wrath or TBC drakes, and the Stone Drakes are absolutely amazing. Kinda ridiculous how, when people saw that drake in Stonecore, they went &quot;OMG I WANT THAT AS A MOUNT&quot; and now stone drakes look &quot;retarded&quot;. Heh.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaudion</div><div class="date">2010-08-23, 05:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once you get beyond the buff itself, there are a variety of ways it is produced by a character. Sometimes it's a base spell. Sometimes it's a talent. Sometimes it's a passive aura. Sometimes it's a proc. Sometimes it goes away when the dude dies. Sometimes it lasts for a duration. We're not interested in making all of these parameters identical, and we think the game would suffer from a pervasive sameness were we to do so. We also think most raiders are sensible enough not to disqualify someone because his buff isn't produced in the absolute most convenient way possible. &quot;Our dps would go up 2% if we had 10% attack power instead of 8% attack power&quot; seems like a reasonable sentiment. &quot;Our dps would go up if the range on this buff were longer&quot; seems like you're really down in the weeds of things to actually worry about.<br />
<br />
I am beyond tired of Blizzard's persistant double-standard when addressing the Shaman class. The fact that they continually marginalize Shaman compared to other classes and justify it with, &quot;Well, that's just not in our design...&quot; is infuriating. It's like a child plugging their ears and going, &quot;La la la la la...&quot;<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if Shaman abilities are baseline when other classes have to talent into them if the talented-into versions are superior in every way. They should know by now that not only do raiders not mind getting &quot;down in the weeds&quot;, they will keep going until they hit bedrock.<br />
<br />
Having to re-cast totems every five minutes vs. a 30 minute buff or passive aura is a matter of convenience. Having a finite effective range vs. a raid-wide effective range is not at matter of convenience. That is a matter of raw effectiveness. When raid mechanics require movement and there is the possibility, no matter how remote, that you can be out of a totem's range and without a buff for an indefinite amount of time when that possibility does not exist for the competing class, then you are purposefully building a disadvantage into the Shaman class. That's not balance.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why this is so hard when it only need concern buff totems. No one expects Magma Totem to have an infinite range. But there's no reason that, say, Stoneskin shouldn't. That, or they need to take the infinite range away from auras and make them identicle to the radius of totems.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much. Asking anyone to interrupt a 1.1 second Polymorph isn't reasonable. Health pools are going to be a lot larger, so control is going to play a larger role than burst compared to the live environment. <br />
Imagine this, you have a melee on you, let's say a rogue, you are crippled, you start casting your 2 seconds fear to get him away from you but because of spell pushback your fear takes 3 seconds to cast. Do you think it's going to work because not everyone is a frost mage.</div></div><hr />

Kinda funny though that the Heroic drake looks much more badass - imo - than the Raid drake.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you kidding me? The ''of the wind'' drakes look awesome. The stone drakes look like they were all beaten with the ugly stick. Honestly not even a mother could love those drakes. Definitely won't be going for them. Though personal preference I guess!</div></div><hr />

You know whats interesting ? You give me a troll answer like l2p and I get banned. It is hard to cast anything while stunned or silenced. I wasn't talking about arena. I don't think the game should be balanced around the arena minority. I don't think melee should get auto win against warlocks outside of arena. On the other hand I don't think there will be spell pushback in cata.</div></div><hr />

And just how many NEW flying mounts could you come up with? Griffins, Hypogriffs, bats, Drakes, Dragons, Proto-Drakes, flying carpets, helocopters, rockets, broomsticks, weird flying mantas... what's left? Kites?<br />

Of course it's reskinned this or retooled that. Until we travel to another planet, I wouldn't expect anything &quot;new&quot; or &quot;unique&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...THE FUCK? I remember you stating VERY clearly, Blizzard, that the goal of these new trees would be to force players to make choices between valuable talents. That, and I think we all agree that firing fucking snakes at your target IS a fun talent in itself.<br />
<br />
...Oh wait. Someone complained that they couldn't get Invigoration and Rhumba in the same build? FIX THAT SHIT HARD /sarcasm<br />
<br />
On a lighter note, I came buckets @the drakes. Don't get peoples' whining over the drake designs - the Drakes of the Wind look nothing like wrath or TBC drakes, and the Stone Drakes are absolutely amazing. Kinda ridiculous how, when people saw that drake in Stonecore, they went &quot;OMG I WANT THAT AS A MOUNT&quot; and now stone drakes look &quot;retarded&quot;. Heh.<br />
<br />
It was stated before that when filling out your DPS tree that you have enough points to pick every dps talent and you should have enough left over to make a choice between a few utility talents, but you could not get all the utility talents. Too many dps talents = very little choice on utility = braindead cookie cutter talent specs which is what blizzard wants to avoid.</div></div><hr />

Its a fantasy game for a reason,it requires a certain ammount of originality and creativity. Something blizzard seems to lack lately.

What are these &quot;special surprise&quot; quests for the Goblin and Worgen DK's?<br />
<br />
One of the last quests for all Death Knights has you run into someone from your hometown (err... same race as you) who recognizes you and says something like, &quot;Hey ZzXzArthasZzXx is that you? Yes it is you! I haven't seen you since forever... What?? What have they done to you? Quiet I hear someone, look, I'm finished, done for, but you, you can still make a difference, quick, if they find us, we're both dead, you have to do it, kill me, QQ...&quot;, if there aren't any worgen or goblin NPCs you wouldn't be able to finish the quest.</div></div><hr />

So I get to be the first one? Awesome! The 4 drakes of the wind are named/colored after the 4 Symbols of the Chinese Constellations. Those being Genbu - Black Tortoise of the North (the color appears green, but look closely and you'll notice they're just highlights on the black skin), Byakko - White Tiger of the West, Suzaku - Vermilion Bird of the South, and Seiryu - Azure Dragon of the East (And yes, I know I'm calling them by their Japanese names, not Chinese names. Sue me. I like them better). They all correspond with an element as well as a season and are oftentimes referenced with &quot;wind&quot; (i.e., Black Tortoise of the North Wind). And because of this fact, it seems someone got Seiryu and Suzaku mixed up. <br />
<br />
Still, what's interesting is, there's typically a 5th deity. &quot;Huang Long, Yellow Dragon of the Center&quot;. I'm wondering if maybe there's a 5th/secret mount/drake looming around somewhere. Or maybe they're just going with the Japanese side of things (which has no deity, since the 5th element is &quot;void&quot; and thus can't be represented by a figure).<br />
<br />
Anywho, just some food for thought. Hope you enjoyed this little tidbit of information on what would otherwise be viewed as &quot;the same mount reskinned&quot;. In this case, the skins actually serve a purpose. I know it certainly smiled when I noticed the corresponding names/colors.</div></div><hr />
