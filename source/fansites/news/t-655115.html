The Faction-Change announcement has been updated with a Q&amp;A<br />
We wanted to give everyone a very early heads-up that, in response to player requests, we’re developing a new service for World of Warcraft that will allow players to change their faction from Alliance to Horde or Horde to Alliance. There’s still much work to do and many details to iron out, but the basic idea is that players will be able to use the service to transform an existing character into a roughly equivalent character of the opposing faction on the same realm. Players who ended up creating and leveling up characters on the opposite factions from their friends have been asking for this type of functionality for some time, and we’re pleased to be getting closer to being able to deliver it.<br />
<br />
As with all of the features and services we offer, we intend to incorporate the faction-change service in a way that won’t disrupt the gameplay experience on the realms, and there will be some rules involved with when and how the service can be used. The number of variables involved increases the complexity of implementing this service, but we plan to take the time needed to ensure that it lives up to expectations before officially rolling it out. We’ll go into much more detail on all of this here at http://www.WorldofWarcraft.com (http://www.WorldofWarcraft.com) as development progresses. In the meantime, we wanted to let you know that because this type of functionality requires extensive internal testing well in advance of release, you may be seeing bits and pieces of the service in the test builds we use for the public test realms moving forward.<br />
<br />
Updated 7/1<br />
Due to the many questions that have come up with the announcement of this new service, we wanted to take the time to answer the ones we can at this point in time.<br />
<br />
Q. Will we be able to switch between the races on our own faction?<br />
A. No. Players will only be able to switch to a race of the opposite faction.<br />
<br />
Q. Will I be able to choose the race on the opposite faction that I want to change to?<br />
A. Yes, but you will only be able to switch to a race that has your class type available to it. So if you play a human paladin, you’d only be able to change to a blood elf paladin.<br />
<br />
Q. How much will it cost?<br />
A. We do not have further information on this at this point in time.<br />
<br />
Q. Will I be able to switch back to my original faction but a different race?<br />
A. No. You will only be able to switch back to your originally chosen race.<br />
<br />
Q. How will the switch between reputation, gear, mounts, etc be handled?<br />
A. We’ll have more details for you at a later point in time, though we plan to keep these as close to a reflection of the other faction as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Q. How often can you change your faction?<br />
A. We do not have any information to share on this at this point in time, however we will have restrictions on the frequency by which players can change their faction.<br />
<br />
Q. How will this affect the balance of Horde and Alliance on the realms?<br />
A. We are taking great care in how we implement this new service in order to maintain balance between the factions on the realms but do not have any further details to share.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not implementing a same faction race change, and having to return to the same race if you change back to your original faction is probably one of the worst ways this could be handled.</div></div><hr />

/spit at this change for the good the sake of wow.<br />
<br />
From a guild perspective it's pretty awesome, but i'm really sadly seeing another thing taken off the horde / alliance fight-differences.</div></div><hr />

We said the name when gender changes came,we said the same from PVE to pvp transfers.<br />

It isnt that-a-big deal</div></div><hr />

/Agreed<br />
<br />
I mean with faction changes you are implementing race changes...so why not have that as well? Also, another thing taken off the horde/alliance fight differences? This was taken away when they made paladins playable by Horde and Shamans playable by Alliance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezman</div><div class="date">2009-07-01, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would rather see a quest line you can do that would cause you to become a traitor to your current faction and gain rep with the other faction. This would mean you change factions keeping your current race and all items. You would start off neutral rep with the new faction's cities/races and need to gain rep if you wish.<br />
<br />
After a several month cool down you can redo the quest line changing back to your original faction however your rep will be reset back to neutral for all the cities.<br />
<br />
<br />
As to having several characters on the same (pvp) realm for both factions. I'm not sure how this would be worked out and don't know how Blizzard will be doing this with the current faction change.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skulli</div><div class="date">2009-07-01, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Race changes would cause problems like &quot;every shaman is an orc or hunter an orc etc&quot;.<br />
They said that before and thats why i am abit confused that you can pick a race on opposite side.</div></div><hr />

That's good to know. I'd hate to lose pretty much everything A-H faction-related.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zuule</div><div class="date">2009-07-01, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So i guess if you are on a PvP server you have to change ALL of your characters to the other faction?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Algos</div><div class="date">2009-07-01, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When they first announced this service, they talked about it in terms of &quot;friends who leveled up on the opposite faction can now join their opposing faction buddies,&quot; so you would think that a server change would be included in the mix. Hell, charge $25 bucks to change faction and another $5 or $10 to include a server change in the mix. One of my close friends has been wishing and hoping that this service was implemented so he could bring his NE druid over to my server Horde side, but if it's gonna cost him $50 bucks to do it I doubt that will happen.</div></div><hr />

I thought the change interface would be simply like the character creation one, without the option to change your class obviously, so you'd be able to change your race AND faction.<br />
<br />
Now for the rep/gear/mounts, I see it a pretty straightforward operation. Every of them have a 1:1 equivalent on the opposite faction anyway, specially after they added extra mounts for tauren since they hadn't enough to achieve the 50 mounts.<br />
<br />
The hard part will be about equalizing faction-specific quests done, gear and achievements. That's gonna take a while to &quot;iron out&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You missed the part where blizzard said if you decide to go back to your original faction. You also return to your original race. I.E. Orc&gt;Draenei&gt;Orc</div></div><hr />

I have characters on both horde side and alliance side at max lvl and i give them both the same amount of playing time each .. but the horde character is covered in PVP gear the alliance character struggles to get the honor to buy pvp gear because alliance suck at BG<br />

just like it is now<br />

<br />
Solution: Harrowing quest chain/reputation grind leading to a defection from your respective faction. Rather than causing a bunch of upset regarding the inability to in-faction race swap, give the people that really want to quit the option to betray their &quot;brethren&quot;. It should have been something worked into the game a long time ago anyways. This way, the Horde/Alliance conflict still makes sense. Honestly, in a role-playing game, it makes sense that not every character is going to want to stay loyal to a cause they were simply forced to support from level 1.<br />

How does the fight change in anyway? You defect to the alliance if you're horde and vice versa. Would probably be one of the reasons if you're playing on a RP realm.<br />

<br />
<br />
the intention is to give people the opportunity to change to the faction of their friends. the freedom of choosing your race by transferring to the other faction is just something that can't be avoided.<br />
i would be happy to change my draenai to a human of course, cause i pvp a lot, but thats just not the intention of this change.</div></div><hr />

You always have the choice to change it. Even on PvP realms if you have 2 accounts. Hell you can always delete your toons on a PvP realm and create another on the opposite faction.. OH MY GOD!!!! The world will explode!!!!<br />

You don't have to change factions, so who cares? <br />
<br />
Anyone can re-roll Horde/Alliance freely. Its not like once you chose Alliance/Horde you had to play that faction exclusively.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chiper</div><div class="date">2009-07-01, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only reason blizzard is doing this is so they can address the faction imbalance that is happening on a lot of realms. I know that on mine (Khaz Modan US) there are 8 alliance characters for every horde. Wintergrasp is will see 3 raids full of alliance and not even one full raid of Horde. The Horde only capture the keep when they've not had it for so long that the tenacity completely overwhelms the population shift. This leads to WG battles that are so skewed that they aren't even fun.<br />
<br />
Two nights ago we had one where the tenacity was so high the horde won the fight in less then four minutes. The entire horde team hit rank two after a couple kills and pummeled the keep with 16 siege engines. It was a brutal loss.<br />
<br />
PvP isn't the only issue, however. Having 90% of the population in alliance only zones causes for issues with server load. Kalimdor is practically dead, even Barrens will only have 4-5 people in it at a time, unless an alliance city raid is planned.<br />
<br />
The only way to handle this kind of issue is to allow faction transfers. They can open up free transfers on my realm from alliance to horde and entire guilds will switch over, especially the hardcore raiders. The opportunity to be top Horde guild on this realm would is like an epeen handjob to these people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
first, and almost intuitive, each faction would have its equivalent on the other side. (Ex: orgrimmar rep -&gt; stormwind rep) but i didnt like this idea as much. it feels too easy, and switching factions deserves some punishment.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
another idea, that i personally liked, accumulated all your points from major cities, divided it all by like 1.4? or 2?, and distribute the points among the new faction major cities evenly. this idea counts neutral as zero, exalted as 42000 (3000 + 6,000 + 12000 + 21000). this idea ignores the last 999 points of exalted, as they're not influential in the game.<br />
<br />
so lets say your rep looked like this: 12025/21000 (revered) Orgrimmar, 11,000/12000 (honored) undercity, 2015/12000 (honored) thunderbluff, 3075/21000 (revered) with trolls. Accumulated all together, thats 88,115 rep points (1/3000 in neutral being 0).<br />
<br />
88,115 / 1.4 = 62939<br />
distributed across 4 factions, 15735 for each faction, meaning you'd be 6375/12000 (honored) with every faction. <br />
<br />
those exalted with every major city before changing over would get punished the most, but why not? they still would be 9k/21k (revered) with every major city, not being a huge punishment, but noticable.<br />

alright now this makes sense. i know it might seem weird about having a nightelf on horde or a undead on alliance but it makes sense somehow.<br />
tauren are neutral when it comes to druids, and their peaceful ways could make easy lore for them to switch over, same with bloodelves and trolls, since their are many different clans of trolls and elves.<br />
humans are corrupt by nature and illidan is a good example of corruption so theirs some more easy lore. <br />
<br />
the only hard ones i see are dreanei - horde and undead - alliance. besides that, it makes this whole faction change a lot more reasonable then all the sudden RACE CHANGE/FACTION CHANGE. <br />
i understand sex change. but for lore it doesnt make sense to just become another race, when youre already progressed.<br />

&quot;Yes, but you will only be able to switch to a race that has your class type available to it. So if you play a human paladin, you’d only be able to change to a blood elf paladin.&quot;<br />

<br />
This seems like a TERRIBLE idea IMO, but since Blizz is now catering to the masses no matter what the request is, I guess it's a good move for them.<br />
<br />
I don't really understand why they wouldn't allow race change if they're allowing this though. Someone said that it'll make all characters of one class one race, but if that's the case, then why doesn't Blizz just balance the racial abilities? Obviously, currently for a Hunter, Orc is the best race to maximize DPS, while a Tauren Hunter seems like nothing good comes from the racials.<br />
<br />
This seems like it's just going to be a HUGE technical accomplishment which should be directed towards something better. Basically they're going to have to match EVERY faction specific element (mounts, pets, achievements, tabards, reputations, items, flight points) of the game to the other faction's element. This may even have further implications for Loremaster and Seeker achievements since you can do all the quests you can easily find with one faction, then switch factions, do all those easy found quests, and BAM, much easier.<br />
<br />
What they should do is have SOME sort of consequence (besides the money they'll almost definitely make you pay to do this) to switching, like clearing all faction specific things like rep, pets, mounts, etc. It would also ease Blizz's headache for the technical details I mentioned before.<br />
<br />
Still though, TERRIBLE idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
not implementing a same faction race change, and having to return to the same race if you change back to your original faction is probably one of the worst ways this could be handled. <br />
<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be wonderful if Blizz took an idea sometime and didn't jack it up, primarily as a means to get yet more money out of us...?<br />
<br />
When I first heard about the possibility, my hopes would be that Blizz would use some intuitive thought, perhaps use a quest chain based structure, on the order of Frenzyheart/Oracle for faction changes.<br />
<br />
No race change necessary. But if you want it, you'd have to actually work at it. <br />
<br />
Alas, no. Once again, rather than opening up possibilities to broaden gameplay (perhaps even coordinated Horde_Alliance questlines/missions against Scourge), they've demonstrated once again that they understand that they are in a business, and the goal of the business is to make money, not to make the gameplay better...</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, despite all the QQ, race changes within the same faction should not be allowed. This is still a MMORPG. Even though you might say &quot;but zomg n00b I dun play on RP serva&quot;, the integrity of the world from an RP perspective has already taken enough of a hammering. Choice of race remains one of the only important decisions left in this game. It is something that gives each faction an individual flavour - take away that decision-making and you take away so much of the character of the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">subanark</div><div class="date">2009-07-01, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The purpose of this is to allow players to play with their friends if they are on a different faction. For this reason, realm transfer (and name change) will probably be included when you use this service, as it is very unlikely that you just happened to roll on the same server as your friends, but choose a different faction. I would not be surprised if you were disallowed from change factions on a pvp realm without changing realms, even if you only had 1 toon. The fact that you can get a better racial (by your perspective) is an unfortunate but necessary side effect. Making it so you go back to your original race is only fair to avoid too much abuse of this system.<br />
<br />
Different factions on the same realm might as well be different realms, as they are different communities, you might compete with the other side a bit, but not much beyond that. There wouldn't be too much QQ if Blizzard decided to swap all the alliance (or horde) from one server to/from another.<br />
<br />
As far as swapping stuff goes quests would be the hardest. The best system I see is to not find any equivalent quests (except for those that are pre-reqs for dailies like the argent tourney), but to not count faction specif quests towards loremaster achievement. Any abuses by allowing a player to do more quests is partly mitigated by the fact that dailies require about the same effort with the same (or better) rewards.</div></div><hr />

It's the quiet majority versus the noisy minority. It always has been, and unfortunately will probably always be that way. The number of people who come onto the forums are an extremely small percentage of the playerbase. I remember when Mike Schramm(from wow.com) was on the &quot;How I WoW&quot; Podcast, he said that only 1% of their readers post comments. Most people log in once a day, check out what's new, and then leave. <br />
Same theory with WoW, and its public forums. Very few people go onto the forums compared to how many are in the game, and most people who log into the forums do so specifically to complain. Most people are okay with the change, its that the few who aren't are extremely noisy about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've liked the server transfer service - then the PvE -&gt; PvP server transfer too.<br />
<br />
Once the Character customization service was announce all I was waiting for was to change the race of some of my chars.<br />
<br />
The fact you can change from faction to other faction before race ... that make no sense.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vorador</div><div class="date">2009-07-01, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously, this is a great thing that they're implementing. I have 10 toons on alliance and I'm completely sick of half of them, now I can get them on a horde server and have some horde fun, without having to farm insane amounts of gold from zero.<br />
The reputations are quite easily transferred, since the main cities and main factions are usually mirrored on the other side (orgrimmar = stormwind, silvermoon = exodar, etc. - take these as the orb of deception does), and many of the others can have similar ones on the other faction. The same goes for achievements and many other things, and since you're transferring to the same class you won't have discrepancies (for example a rogue would have an easyer time getting the &quot;fall 65 yards&quot; or whatever that was achievement than other classes).<br />
<br />
The biggest problem by far comes with the quests that you have done. They can for example use a percentage - you completed 462/700 quests in Eastern Kingdoms as alliance - 66%, they'll use the same percentage for the horde side, meaning 363/550 as Horde. This however does not solve the quests solved in some particular areas, faction-specific instance quests, etc. On the other hand it would be quite unfair to wipe the slate clean and give you 0 quests completed on transfer, not to mention the fact that you can then get some reputations to higher levels than normally possible...<br />
<br />
I guess we'll wait and see. This is a hard one for blizz and I sincerely hope they do it properly, since I want to transfer a lot of chars :D.</div></div><hr />

This is the most messed up idea I've ever seen them develop. I seriously almost fell off my chair there. Then again, I can see their reasoning behind it (though I do not share it):<br />
1 - they are not doing this for the min maxers but really for friends that wanna play together;<br />
2 - if they allowed you to switch races again on your way back, they would be called money grabbers for the millionth time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pomr</div><div class="date">2009-07-01, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a very very cool thing meant to allow friends of different factions play together once more. In my case I was on an Alliance server but the guild pretty much broke up with some seriously bad feelings. Some re-rolled Horde (After a long idle time), some (like myself) switched to other servers where they had friends. I personally despise leveling alts, some people love it, my wife has 5 (or is it 6?) level 80s currently, all with epic flight.<br />
<br />
Myself, I focused on gearing and rep grinding my main toon. I've been a hard core raider (not a great one), and now am a more casual player.<br />
<br />
The long and short of the story is that when this is implemented I have the option to transfer my toon back to the server I came from originally, and play with some of the best friends I've ever made in my life.<br />
<br />
The reason they aren't going to (at least right away) implement race transfers in the same faction is likely what many have been saying - min/maxers would abuse it. Of course I have great faith in people's ability to abuse just about anything, so I'm sure abuses will be forthcoming and will generate tons of QQ all on their own. =)<br />
<br />
Blizzard is being accused of trying to make money - what do you think pays for the new content, the server upgrades and so on? Can it be excessive? Sure! People can abuse anything, but this is a service I will gladly pay for.</div></div><hr />

I've always regretted my choice for human over undead. at this point I'm unlikely to switch but would be an option if I had friends who played horde somewhere. I'm sure those who do will cheer loudly at this feature.<br />
<br />
however, my main concern is that it will kill low population factions. alliance on magtheridon eu, horde on silvermoon eu are good examples.<br />
but then again, if those people wanted to transfer, they'd do it already with the current server transfer system so maybe it's not an issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean looking at it RP wise you are betraying your brethren and somehow disfiguring / conceling your true form to hide among your new allies. If you were exalted with the Frostwolves why should the Stormpike Guards suddenly love you?<br />
<br />
Sure it sucks to have to rep up with a pile of factions again or possibly loosing a couple of PvP / Reputation achieves but guess what you opted into a drastic character change and those are the strings that should come with. Don't want to re grind Kurenai rep this time with the Mag'har then dont betray them by befriending there arch enemies.<br />
<br />
Neutral factions will still be cool with the new you and the faction you choose to transfer to can be exalted if your previous racial faction was but why should the Forsaken welcome the night elf who enjoys dressing up as an Orc simply because he was previously exalted with Ironforge?<br />
<br />
But no one will care what RP players say. The game has progressively gotten to be more of a social networking site. Oh well, enjoy World of Facebook.</div></div><hr />

Aszune has a 2:1 alliance horde relation.<br />
If horde are allowed to switch, we'll be looking at 3:1 soon.<br />

It should definitely only allow transfers if the balance is &quot;at most&quot; 1.2 - 1.0, if the balance were to get to 1.3 - 1.0 it should be locked for the smaller faction.</div></div><hr />

As for the imbalanced servers with ratios of 2:1 or 3:1 - there already is the solution of MOVING TO ANOTHER SERVER where your faction is well represented. Changing factions will most probably not be detrimental for several reasons:<br />
1) on pve servers nobody cares :D<br />
2) on pvp servers people usually have more than one char, so they will definitely not be allowed to faction change one character to the same server, they'd either have to change all of them or faction to another server. I don't see this affecting the ratio problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After a several month cool down you can redo the quest line changing back to your original faction however your rep will be reset back to neutral for all the cities.<br />
<br />

As to having several characters on the same (pvp) realm for both factions. *I'm not sure how this would be worked out and don't know how Blizzard will be doing this with the current faction change.<br />

<br />
I So totally agree with this,go to the other faction as what race you are now and earn you way up with whatever faction your choose to be with.* The Factions that don't require you to be an ally or horde should stay the same. I also agree we should be able to change our race within our own faction. We can change sex ( like thats not odd) but we can't go from, Dwarf to human or undead to B elf</div></div><hr />

If you think that it's a good way to buy stuff of the opposite faction, i think you are wrong. First it will cost money (same price than server changes seems logical) moreover for sure there will be a time limitation to change again (same than server changes) and finally you can still reroll in the opposite faction to do this job (or ask a friends etc). So where is the problem with that ?<br />
<br />
It's just a little feature that will not change the game a lot. Personnaly, i'm really happy with this service. My guild disband a few month ago and most of my friends sopped WoW. So i rerolled on a new server to play with another friends who played in opposite faction. It means that i will play my old character with my new friends, so it looks interesting in fact.<br />

Though this could potentially be used like a race change. Example, roll a BE paladin with the intention of playing horde, then trasnfer it to alliance and make it say human. If in future patched dwarf becomes a better choice back to horde and the to allaince again for a dwarf.<br />
<br />
Well would cost a bit and some time since it will probaly have a CD, but there defenatly some people that would do it. Thats unless if you go back and forth you only get one race to choose from on alliance ie. the one you chose the first time you went horde -&gt; alliance, well lets se how this works out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
from personal experience:<br />
<br />
i started playing wow 2006~ and have been playing alliance for 6months before finding out that 2 of my friends played horde on another server.... i had to re-roll on the horde server and level up a fresh character, which while being a little easier than usual, was still a hassle to do.<br />
<br />
if this was available then.. i could have taken my level 60, transfered him to the other server flipped factions and played with my friends right away, rather than wait to get power-leveled and regeared.<br />

<br />
On the other side on my other chars on ever pop servers this really doesn't change anything-- think ill dodge all the 10 year old alli players on even pop servers.. sry kids.</div></div><hr />

Rather than causing a bunch of upset regarding the inability to in-faction race swap, give the people that really want to quit the option to betray their &quot;brethren&quot;. It should have been something worked into the game a long time ago anyways. This way, the Horde/Alliance conflict still makes sense. Honestly, in a role-playing game, it makes sense that not every character is going to want to stay loyal to a cause they were simply forced to support from level 1.<br />
<br />
I dunno. Always wanted this option, personally. What do you think?<br />
<br />
<br />
It would kill the game if they do this. Think about it, races will be a huge blur in factions...then factions differences wouldnt be much more than just a Red team or Blue team. At the same time, i rerolled Horde from alliance because horde races seem to attract more mature players, which was already affected by Blood Elves being in horde side. I don´t mind this fact that much...but by following your suggestion you´d have 12 year olders and their Night elves in the horde. I don´t think im the only one that would hate this fact. And not because i have anything against younger ppl playing the game, but the race and therefore faction selection is dictacted in great part by the demographic profile of the player.</div></div><hr />

What about swaping over to buy other faction pets so you don't have to pay an arm and a leg in the AH and then switching back?<br />
<br />
What about alliance only cooking recipes? <br />
<br />
What about just transporting goods between one faction and the other on toons that are swaping back and forth for those that like to play the AH markets.<br />
<br />
Are you removed from your guild? what if you are the only person in your guild? will it transfer<br />
<br />
<br />
1) I was wondering about that as well, but its quite manageable to get all the quest achievements without doing so.<br />
<br />
2) Like someone already pointed out (for other reasons), the vendor recipes, pets, etc would be the last reason to transfer. I got most of mine just by setting up a trade (horde for alliance or visa versa) on my realm forum. If trial accounts can use the neutral AH, that might work (never tried).<br />
<br />
3) This was the first thing i thought about, it would be nice if this and variants of were possible.<br />
<br />
4) There will be a cooldown and I'd guess its 1-6 months. Not to mention its already possible to use the neutral AH to send stuff over.<br />
<br />
5) It will work the same as realm transfers.<br />

I'm sure they'll eventually allow for paid same-faction race changes. You really think Blizzard cares if every Alliance priest is a human? Hell no. First off, you'll still have variety because some people care more about cosmetics than min/maxing. Secondly, we're talking about paid services. Alliance non-human priests re-racing to human for a $10 service charge, times, say, 5,000 first week. Woot, $50,000 just off Alliance priest reracing. For all race/class combos that would be tempted to min/max, I'm sure they'd net over a million in the first week it was launched even if they only charged $10. You think Blizzard would mind that? Hell no. It's entertainment for us, it's a business for them. <br />

Wouldn't the options for most classes be pretty limited anyway? It's not like you're going to be able to make a tauren rogue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because some of us did make our char way too long ago , and many things can't be redone if rerolling. Our goal is to change our appearance mostly , Animation , and size.<br />
<br />
And about people saying they do that to prevent us to get FotM racial. Well , any people of the opposit faction can choose any race from their opposit faction. So , all in all , they'll be able to take what you call FotM.</div></div><hr />

Every new thing that they come out with is just another marketing ploy in hopes of raking in even more money than they already get from our $15 / month. It's a never-ending spiral of ways to make money. <br />
-Realm Transfers<br />
-Character Transfers<br />
-Character name/sex changes<br />
-Now this faction change?<br />
<br />
I just hope everyone remembers why they rolled the faction they did. And STOP GIVING BLIZZARD MONEY!!! THEY HAVE ENOUGH!! <br />
<br />
Ask yourself every time you get the message &quot;additional instances cannot be launched at this time...&quot; why don't they buy more servers?</div></div><hr />

What will happen with this change faction thing is that all alliance players would like to make their character a horde, and all the Horde players will see that their Faction is becomings full of noobs will just migrate or change their faction to Alliance... Hope this faction change won't be coming soon</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nethrin</div><div class="date">2009-07-03, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what i want to know is this-<br />
<br />
Everyone keeps saying they won't allow race changes in the same faction for min/maxers. <br />
<br />
Ok..............<br />
<br />
So all those alliance that are going to come horde side are allowed to min/max their character? Is that fair to me?<br />
<br />
The thing with people wanting to change their own race within the same faction is that Blizzard has changed the racials so much since vanilla wow WHY WOULDN&quot;T people want to change races? <br />
<br />
Or... you have people like me.... I made a blood elf DK with the intent to PvP grind with him for the extra silence, magic resists or free runic power if needed.. Now I have become more into raiding, and RARELY pvp at all anymore. I would like to be a Troll DK for Beserk or Orc DK for inceased pet dmg, exp with weapons, free AP trinket. <br />
<br />
It's not fair for the people that rolled Ally DKs to be able to min/max their DK for whatever purpose they choose, while stiffing Horde DKs to be stuck with something they thought they would be doing. Hell, they are about to change the Troll's beserk racial right now. So all these UD/BE/T Dk's that might have started idea to pvp, but want to raid now might actually want to be a Troll now for the baseline 20% haste. I personally want to change from BE DK to Orc DK for more optimized raiding with my character.<br />
<br />
<br />
And i'm not even going to begin listing all the advantages of Horde players switching to Ally to min/max themselves for pvp/pve.<br />
<br />
269027856026892 Humans running around in arenas or whatever. <br />
<br />
All I'm saying is the min/max excuse is bullSH8T, cause anyway you look at it, people are going to be faction/race changing to min/max. Period. The people saying blizzard is just wrong for this cuase they are money hungry can chill too, cause if they were, they would allow Be --&gt; Human --&gt; Orc and make you pay twice. You guys aren't blizzard, you don't know their reasoning why they are doing what they are doing. All in all though, same faction race change not being allow is terrible.</div></div><hr />

There is equivalence since both side got exactly the same amount today.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadyone</div><div class="date">2009-07-03, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only issue i see in this new change, is all the people who rerolled horde -&gt; alliance or the other way around, as the same class due to skins/racials. This will probably seem like such a waste to them now.<br />
Other than that i kinda like the idea, mainly because I'm one of those bored people who cba to level a horde character.</div></div><hr />

This is just about every WoW player's Character Selection Sheet:<br />

80 Tauren Shaman<br />
80 Orc Hunter<br />
80 Blood Elf Paladin<br />
80 Blood Elf Rogue<br />
80 Blood Elf Mage<br />
80 Blood Elf Priest<br />
80 Blood Elf Hunter<br />
80 Blood Elf Death Knight<br />

It was fine how it was before =/ Most of my characters are alliance but if I wanna play horde I just get on my dk...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">theeyeofneji</div><div class="date">2009-07-08, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly dont mind the faction changing,i think its a long overdue feature.But your really allowing us to switch entire factions but not letting us switch races on our side? when i heard of this,that was the only thing i was intrested in,being able to change from a tauren whose racials obviously revolve around pvp to an orc whose racials are very pve friendly as a shaman(not to mention ive,after playing my cow for a while,grown long tired of being gigantic and foolish looking),this new patch more so because of the 5 expertise to fist weapons as well as axes.<br />
<br />
Some would say &quot;then why would you roll a tauren then?&quot; well i had no idea i was going to be a pve nut 2 years ago,so it depresses me when a similar geared orc or troll can out damage me just because they each have racial trinkets when im stuck with lolwarstomp.I dont think i should have to reroll my favorite class just because my racials gimp my burn and gearing options(ex. orcs using axe/fists wont have to stack on nearly as much expertise as say a tauren or troll).<br />
<br />
Conclusion:giving us the ability to change factions and race with the same character is borderline retarded if we cannot change to our own factions races to fully enjoy the benefits towards gaming or preference in looks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How will mounts work?<br />
Reputation switches? For examples, if you're alliance exalted with all 5 cities will you be exalted with all 5 horde cities?<br />
Will a &quot;Faction change&quot; also come with a realm switch/Character Recustomization as sort of a package deal?<br />
<br />
If not, will faction change share cool downs with realm transfers and character recustomization?<br />
<br />
For example, if I have a Tauren Druid Male, and want to go to a night elf, and I was on a PvP realm, I would HAVE to get a realm switch because of obvious reasons of not having both factions on PvP and well male night elfs just look retarded in my opinion<br />
<br />
I'm sure others have asked similar questions, please respond with if you have any knowledge about these. Thanks for taking the time to read my post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed, and I'm sure they will add that soon enough.</div></div><hr />
