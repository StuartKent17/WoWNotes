Pre-Expansion Patch Items<br />
There are some fun and useful items you can obtain prior to and during the Broken Shore scenario! <br />
<br />
Pocket Fel Spreader (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140363-pocket-fel-spreader)<br />
<br />
Check Group Finder for a group that is farming the item.<br />
Use a Demon tracking mechanism (Spectral Sight (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/188501-spectral-sight), Track Demons (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/19878-track-demons), or Elixir of Detect Demon (http://www.wowdb.com/items/9233-elixir-of-detect-demon))<br />
Talk to the Doomsayers in Orgrimmar and Stormwind until you find one with a special dialogue option. <br />
Click the dialogue option and kill the Doomsayer when it turns into a demon. <br />
The item is not a guaranteed drop, but the drop rate and spawn rates have been hotfixed (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763161350235312128) to be better. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Alliance<br />
<br />
After starting the Broken Shore quest line but before you leave to go to battle, visit Lenny &quot;Fingers&quot; McCoy (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/108533-lenny-fingers-mccoy) in the harbor to grab Lucky Shirt (http://www.wowdb.com/items/138385-lucky-shirt).<br />
After entering the Broken Shore, you can obtain the item needed to get Alaina's Bonnet (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139391-alainas-bonnet):<br />
<br />
During Stage 6 or 7 of the Broken Shore, pick up Charred Locket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139389-charred-locket) from Ashes of a Fallen Crusader (http://www.wowdb.com/objects/240215-ashes-of-a-fallen-crusader).<br />
Head to Alaina Hearthsong (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/110625-alaina-hearthsong) in Eastvale Logging Camp in Elwynn Forest and give her the locket. <br />
Get far enough away to allow her to despawn and then return.<br />
Loot Alaina's Bonnet (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139391-alainas-bonnet) from the chest upstairs. <br />
<br />

Demon Hunter Starting Level<br />
Demon Hunters will start at 98 in the same way that Death Knights start at 55. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20748344634?page=1#2))<br />

Deleting Demon Hunter<br />
We've just implemented a hotfix that will allow newly-created Demon Hunters to be deleted despite having unread mail.<br />

Glacial Spike Hotfix<br />
Glacial Spike on its own is not a problem. It requires a good deal of setup including 5 frostbolts and a 3 second cast time to get off. We want something like that to have good payoff. The problem is the synergy between Deep Shatter, Ice Form and Glacial Spike. The intent of the Deep Shatter talent was to make your Frostbolts feel powerful. It wasn't intended to make Glacial Spike deal 2 million damage.<br />
<br />
We've made a hotfix change to Deep Shatter. Icicles will no longer benefit from the extra damage from Deep Shatter. We think this change allows both Deep Shatter and Glacial Spike to feel powerful on their own.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone who brought this issue to our attention through playtesting.<br />
<br />
how is 300k a good pay off<br />
I know where you are getting the 300k number from and it's possible there are more things at play than just the nerf. Our intention is that a Glacial Spike can hit in the 700-900k range at level 110 with proper setup. But when paired with Deep Shatter, it was possible for Glacial Spike to hit in the 2 million range. Since players have somewhere in the area of 2 million health, this is unacceptable. We like setup and high payoff, but we do not want spells that deal 100% of a player's health in battlegrounds and arenas.<br />
<br />
If spells have a lot of setup and counterplay, we're comfortable with them doing damage in the 700k-900k range. If a spell has little counterplay but perhaps a long cooldown, we can see it hitting in the 400-500k range. Hopefully those numbers can serve as reference when giving feedback.<br />
<br />
But to be clear, 2 million is way out of bounds and to suggest it is okay feels a bit disingenuous. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/587913-glacial-spike/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20748195472?page=3#42))<br />

Blizzard at gamescom 2016<br />
Blizzard will be at gamescom this year! Ion Hazzikostas appears a few times on the schedule with some streamers. <br />
The world’s largest interactive entertainment trade fair is coming back to Cologne, Germany from August 17-21 this year, and Blizzard Entertainment will be there with our biggest presence to date!<br />
<br />
Mark your calendar for 18:30 CEST on Tuesday, August 16, when we release a special preview video of what we’ll be showcasing at gamescom 2016, including some new game content. You'll be able to watch it all live on the Blizzard gamescom hub.<br />
<br />
Visitors to the Blizzard gamescom booth in Hall 7 of the Koelnmesse will have the chance to play Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, Diablo, and StarCraft on more than 500 gaming stations. We’ll also have some epic entertainment on the Blizzard stage, and a few surprises in store.<br />
<br />
<br />
From August 18-21, the Legion Café will bring a recreation of The Fel Hammer to central Cologne to celebrate the upcoming launch of World of Warcraft’s latest expansion<br />
Visitors to the Blizzard booth will be able to try out the new Demon Hunter class in advance of the August 30 release of World of Warcraft: Legion<br />
Two of the top World of Warcraft guilds will race against each other in Legion's top tier difficulty dungeons (Mythic+) live on the Blizzard stage<br />
<br />
<br />
In addition to the above activities, we’ll feature our famous dance and costume contests, signing sessions, quizzes, contests, and more—including two performances from Video Games Live on our stage on Friday, August 19 and Saturday, August 20 at 18:00! Attendees at gamescom will also be able to pick up some licensed apparel and collectibles, including some brand-new items, at the Blizzard store in Hall 5.<br />
<br />
Daily Live Streams and Recaps<br />
Those who can’t make it to gamescom 2016 in person will still be able to catch all the excitement via daily live streams of our stage activities each day on the Blizzard gamescom hub (http://gamescom.blizzard.com/). Well-known streamers will also be bringing you live action from the Blizzard booth, which you’ll be able to check out directly from the website, along with a daily recap video each evening at 21:00 CEST.

Will DHs be able to loot world boss mounts? They aren't listed in the journal as possible loot for them &amp; no loot from Sha/Nal.<br />
should be able to yes (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762483028513783808))<br />
<br />
World Events<br />
Praying for an answer: Dalaran over Karazhan on the 9th too?<br />
Still in-transit during the week, pops in the week after. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762704886198743041))<br />
<br />
Does that mean there will be more questlines unlocked in the coming weeks? Or did I read that wrong?<br />
.New quests every week leading up to launch, featuring Magni, Khadgar, Ulduar, Karazhan, and a mobile Dalaran. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762707538370367488))<br />
<br />
If Broken Shore is pre-patch, does this mean that &quot;Legion Launch&quot; is simply the teleport from old dalaran to new + onward?<br />
Correct, 8/30 Launch Night begins with an in-game sequence showing Dalaran blink to the Broken Isles. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762710219788918784))<br />
<br />
If I can't play during the last week before Legion launch, will I miss the last quesline?<br />
.You can go back and experience it at any time by talking to Archivist Elysiana in Dalaran in Broken Isles. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762732885828784128))<br />
<br />
Since you can skip the Broken Shores intro now, any plans on being able to get the gear from the quests that were skipped, too?<br />
You can go back and do the skipped intro quests at any time. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/761555678632620033))<br />
<br />
Servers<br />
are you concerned that with all these servers merged, when Legion launches, the game will crash due to do many people?<br />
Servers aren't merged, nor are they technically CRZ'd anymore, it's new tech that creates &quot;shards&quot; as necessary. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762771150371860480))<br />
Goal is much more stability and on-demand area creation/population stabilization. Had a few kinks to work out, but v. cool. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/762771343993556993))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Since people won't be able to get full artifact traits before tournaments, why allow artifacts at events then? Holinka<br />
&quot;Tournament Rules&quot; War Games grant fully powered up Artifacts. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/761782241802399744))<br />

They're 5.3 toys THAT WERE REMOVED FROM THE GAME, AND WERE NO LONGER OBTAINABLE.<br />
<br />
It's not like they're just giving them access to toys that you can still acquire, these toys were all really popular toys that had their sources removed from the game.<br />
<br />
They could have added some of the Alliance-Only toys that had their sources removed, but they didn't.<br />
<br />
I think their opinion still has merit.</div></div><hr />

Don't feel too bad. I got the charred locket, went to the logging camp and gave it to Alaina. I then backed off until her character pane despawned. Went back and went upstairs and no bonnet.<br />

If I didn't just finish the line I'd buy more then for those having issues, but I didn't think about it. My closest to 98 is a 70 ally =/<br />

<br />
People without an Alliance character will not be able to get the Shirt as well as the bonnet unless they are willing to pay another player for it.<br />
<br />
People with only 1 character will also not be able to get any items if they have already completed the Broken Shore questline before knowing that it was possible to get theses items.<br />
<br />
Even if the Alliance player knows about the locket, they may still be unable to loot it as the event may progress due to the other players in the 40 man group.<br />
<br />

I would have liked to have heard this before doing the broken shore on all 9 of my 100s, but I suppose finding out late rather than never is still good.<br />

Even though it's not good.<br />

It's bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Delete your Cache folder.<br />
<br />
<br />
So people without a Horde character will not be able to get these toys and the Feet cosmetic item.<br />
<br />
People without an Alliance character will not be able to get the Shirt as well as the bonnet unless they are willing to pay another player for it.<br />
<br />
People with only 1 character will also not be able to get any items if they have already completed the Broken Shore questline before knowing that it was possible to get theses items.<br />

You act like you can't fix this by making another Lv.100 character.</div></div><hr />

I mean, I get that you want to make it so you don't have long stretches of time without news, but I'd think it'd be pretty important to tell people this before the event that you can only do once goes live.</div></div><hr />

They are still up. Perhaps someone on your server killed them with the dreadlord buff?</div></div><hr />

Regarding the pocket fel spreader toy: I hop on my hunter, turn on 'track demons,' and then fly around to the doom sayers hoping to find that second dialogue option? Is there more to it than that? Like if the dialogue option is not available do I have to accept the pamphlet and suicide my character to reset the doomsayer? Would that increase my chances at all? How does the dialogue option &quot;spawn?&quot;</div></div><hr />

You turn on tracking then talk to Doomsayers until you get the option. If you accept a pamphlet you can still get the option, so no suicide required. Problem is the timer on it is ridiculous. Supposedly a hotfix went out yesterday to fix it, but that didn't work. Then a hotfix to fix the hotfix went out this morning with rolling restarts. Haven't heard if that worked or not.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't answer my question, but thank you for trying!  I am wanting to know what &quot;spawns,&quot; the second dialogue option. Will it randomly spawn on a Domm-sayer regardless of whether I have interacted with the doomsayer? Do I increase my odds of seeing the second dialogue option by accepting pamphlet and waiting 15min or suiciding my character to &quot;refresh,&quot; the doomsayer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It did answer the question. The pamphlet has absolutely no impact on the second dialogue. You will either get the second dialogue or not. You keep running around to every Doomsayer until it is there. Track demons won't do anything special except give you the possibility of seeing the option. The second option will never be there unless you have Sense Demons, Track Demons or Elixir of Demon Detect. You can stand there and spam the same Doomsayer 24/7 it may or may not ever have that option. It will randomly go to any Doomsayer and someone has to interact with it.<br />
<br />
Let's say you talk to Doomsayer A, but Doomsayer C has it. You talk to A 24/7 and you won't ever see it until you talk to C. Once you get the second option, you click it and it spawns on the spot, but be prepared to kite it or something as it's a pain to solo.<br />
<br />
There are no ways of increasing odds. The second option is just a hidden buff by Blizzard and you have no way of knowing who has it or when it will spawn.<br />
<br />
Essentially as I wrote in the first post all you do is pop demon tracking and talk to Doomsayers until RNG blesses you.</div></div><hr />

I know they are 5.3 toys but that does not mean everyone already has them. I don't have them, my friend didn't have them (now he do, he is a horde) and many other ppl do not have them (and propably will not cuz they will not waste time to make alt for them) so you are wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe their point is that they are 5.3 toys. Everyone had a chance to get them in 5.3 and if you didn't you were SoL at the time. Now you have a second chance to get them. You don't have to level an alt now either. You can do it during Legion as the Broken Shore scenario will still be available (or you can skip). So if you really want them you have plenty of time to hit 98 and grab them.</div></div><hr />
