Cataclysm Tier 1 Raid Hall of Fame<br />
It's been a long time since the Hall of Fame, I almost forgot about it for Cataclysm but it's nice to have a list of first kills for each region at the end of a raiding tier! I added Taiwanese kills to the list because some of these guilds are very competitive and deserve the attention. <br />

It's probably a good occasion to point out that vodka (http://www.vodka-guild.net/) got the US first kill on Sinestra earlier this week. I didn't give a lot of love to US first kills during that raid tier, I suggest that US guilds spam me a lot more in the future to prevent that. (Bribes work too) <br />

10 mans are simply overtuned. I imagine now that most the world firsts are done, they'll get tuned soon. Just a hunch.</div></div><hr />

No.<br />

No to your no. That's why Ensidia started as 10man as well and changed to 25man. Nearly everything was harder in 10man as opposed to 25man. They didn't do it for salt nor sugar.</div></div><hr />

What? I don't know where you are getting your information but Paragon focused 25 mans from the beginning. The earlier heroic bosses (Halfus and Omnotron) were MUCH easier on 10 man.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mithsploit</div><div class="date">2011-01-31, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were some absolutely massive bugs that were obvious from the first pull; Shadow Orbs sweeping the whole room and killing everyone in the raid. The Dark Simulacrum (and other reflects) &amp; Wrack was probably the biggest one. You could literally hit the boss for 1 billion damage with a single GCD - it was pretty damn scary watching Sinestra almost die to it by accident.<br />
<br />
And yet they weren't even slightly scared to do many attempts using the obvious Rip bug on Heroic Nefarian to do near half million rip ticks and near full million rip tick crits.<br />
<br />
What a steaming pile of crap. Don't get me wrong... no doubt he was still no pushover and I understand the desire to get a kill by any means when the competition is so fierce, but the sheer hypocrisy in this compared to their supposed stance on Sinestra combined with a video like this glorifying an obviously bugged and unintended kill method is nothing short of shameful.<br />

I bet you think Ensidia deserved the ban they got then? They &quot;abused&quot; a bug that they didn't know why was caused. They even said that they thought it was an encounter bug and since none els was attempting the boss, they didn't have anyone to compare it with.

Method, Paragon should have gotten a ban just like Ensidia did for their LK kill. Method however waited weeks before they even attempted nef after paragon killed it. It was clear early on that they had used the rip bug, yet Method didnt try it for weeks. They waited to see what blizzards respond was, it was a hot fix and nothing els.

I'm sorry, how exactly you consider completely altering the right and passing a major fight mechanic like valkyrs with obvious bug to be same thing as... well... clicking rip, which just did ton of dmg, just like it was supposed to do, not altering the fight in anyway, nor affect any fight mechacnic at all?<br />

LOL, what a bad analogy comparing 100m with the 200m vs 10man and 25man.<br />
<br />
There might be design issues from blizz side making one or the other boss harder for the groups but 100m and 200m are designed to be different.<br />
<br />
Just becuase fanboys are screaming that one encounter or the other is harder for 10m or 25m doesnt mean there is some commonly accepted view on what is harder.<br />
<br />
Therefore its much better to go with the official blizz view on the raid tier, which is that the difficulty is the same for both groups.</div></div><hr />

That's not a correct comparison since both modes have the same number of bosses., no one runs more meters they both run the same distance.<br />
I fail to understand why the 2 modes must be separated the only real hard thing in 25 is to get 25 instead of 10.<br />
Both have pros and cons and they are almost balanced atm with 10man HC being slightly overtuned.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drunkenfinn</div><div class="date">2011-01-31, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So they just stacked the class that would benefit the most of an intended mechanic. How is that exploiting?<br />
<br />
It is not. Every DoT would have gained benefit from the MC buff, just that Rip, being the strongest DoT, gained the most out of it. Hence the class stacking. Blizzard changed this mechanic a bit to prevent such stacking, not beacause they considered it an &quot;exploit&quot;.<br />
<br />
Class stacking to beat an encounter =/= Exploiting. Or if it is, then I guess bringing 3 or more Disc Priests for Smite-spam on Halfus HC is exploiting as well.<br />
<br />
If you want to blame someone, blame Blizzard for bad mechanic design.</div></div><hr />

Dunno if u both have exp on both 10m and 25m bosses, but doesn't matter what Blizzard planned to do, it matter how boss work, 10m and 25m are NOT the same.<br />
Same goes for class, blizz say that they should be balance, are they? NO.<br />
<br />
And yeah agree prob not the best example to take, but still, my point is that they are 2 completely different istance, for a number of reason, starting from the need of only 10 good player, ending to the fact that spreading 10player is easier that 25player, with a lot more of reason between. The design of boss can be the same, but the method to kill it is not.</div></div><hr />

Did you read their statement? Even when the bug appeared they keep killing valkyrs, it was a bug from blizzard's side and Ensidia got punished for playing the freaking game, but when paragon ABUSED a game mechanic, for it to hours later get hot fixed.

Like they said rip was just better than other dots. If they had casters a vt or ua bane of doom or whatever would have done amazing damage as well. It's not like other guilds were not using this mechanic as well paragon simply abused it the most. It is nothing comparable to saronite bombs as every other guild was most likely using this mechanic in the same manner it just so happens para did it the most efficient way and happened to have a ton of people with geared enough ferals for the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The system is balanced.<br />
The pros become cons and the opposite in both modes.<br />
Foe example<br />
In 10man HC a raider's death mean an almost guaranteed wipe, in 25man HC you can kill a boss with 22 members so the &quot;less space to move&quot; thing becomes irrelevant.<br />

<br />
Of course. Any guild focused on bragging rights would obviously take the easier path.<br />
<br />
I do agree with the others who have suggested separate rankings, given how much easier those fights are on 25 than 10. Or at the very least note which guild beat the more difficult mode (be it 10 or 25), and ranking them above the guild beating the easier mode.<br />
<br />
IDK why people are angry that Paragon exploited this bug. It's Blizzard's fault, not Paragon's, and it isn't nearly as bad as using DI on Razorgore or similar bugs that completely break a fight, rather than just dramatically reducing its difficulty. It might be worth creating a separate world/regional first list for the guilds that beat the unexploitable version of the fight though, seeing as it obviously took more skill to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Separate 10 and 25 man raiding or you are unjustifying it for the 10 man only guilds. Also if a guild like US-Adept kills Al'akir 10 hc dont even bother posting stuff like that, they are a 25 man guild and got access to way more(see 3x DKs that pulls high dps, what 10-man guild got that?) then 14 players(that a 10 man guild with alot of players got to fit in 10 man/week).</div></div><hr />

Sorry but that &quot;Fanboy&quot; has every right to say what he said. 800k rip ticks is NOT a clean kill.

Method should be granted World First Heroic 25m Nef, fair and square. They did it with no sploits, and most likely worked their asses off to accomplish this. My hat is off to them for doing it clean, not using 11 druids to steamroll an obviously broken (at the time) fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I still blame Blizzard's (lack of) internal testing. It's hard to justify those sorts of bugs going live.<br />
<br />
There are still 10 man heroic fights that are tuned to the point of being nearly mathematically impossible.<br />
<br />
It indicates to me that they don't have even two dozen employees skilled enough to see every phase of these fights while getting paid to do so months before they go live. That indicates to me that they should probably hire some. I mean really, they can easily set up whatever raid comp they want in the best possible gear, and if they can't manage to at least see every phase of the encounter under those circumstances they either need better testers, or the fights are overtuned.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that a lot of this stuff just isn't tested AT ALL, which is very, very sloppy coming from a company with the kind of resources that Blizzard has. It looks like the PTR patch with its massive spell bugs (DOTs clipping even more severely than WOTLK, DOT ticks and DD spells not landing 15%+ of the time) will go live, despite those bugs being reported for WEEKS without any sort of acknowledgement. It's a bit disconcerting, frankly disrespectful to the player base, and makes games like Rift and SWTOR look more appealing.</div></div><hr />

Method, Paragon should have gotten a ban just like Ensidia did for their LK kill. Method however waited weeks before they even attempted nef after paragon killed it. It was clear early on that they had used the rip bug, yet Method didnt try it for weeks. They waited to see what blizzards respond was, it was a hot fix and nothing els. Method in my eyes got world first.<br />
<br />
Because the boss buffing your attacks and one class have a attack that is stupid more efficient (thanks to blizzard own balance) than the others is totally equal to using a item to rebuild a plataform and totally ignore one of the worst mechanics in the fight.<br />
<br />
Sure...<br />
<br />
Maybe they should ban ppl who play classes that are way more eficient at sinestra thanks to their use of haste since there is a huge haste buff in the fight...<br />
<br />
Do you really need to give that much tought about it? That using a explicit bug, attempt after attempt, to get the kill and only after it, reporting to show up as good guys (like they used to do through WoW) instead of reporting 1st have nothing in common with a class/spec using the most out of a encounter buff? Fail &quot;disguised ensidia love&quot; is fail, bro.<br />

The pros become cons and the opposite in both modes.<br />
Foe example<br />
In 10man HC a raider's death mean an almost guaranteed wipe, in 25man HC you can kill a boss with 22 members so the &quot;less space to move&quot; thing becomes irrelevant.<br />
<br />
I don't really care that much to convince you but either you want it or not the difficulty in both modes are the same more or less.<br />

You know that 25man bosses use skills that they don't on 10, right?</div></div><hr />

It was an obvious bug that they abused and instead of Blizz doing what they should have done just like they did with Ensidia, they turned the other cheek and basically gave them &quot;No harm, no foul&quot;.<br />
<br />
Method should be granted World First Heroic 25m Nef, fair and square. They did it with no sploits, and most likely worked their asses off to accomplish this. My hat is off to them for doing it clean, not using 11 druids to steamroll an obviously broken (at the time) fight.<br />
<br />
Broken is using Dark Simulacrum and almost one-shot Sinestra, wich got hotfixed right after it. Broken is using a item that ignore a important mechanic in a fight like LK.<br />
<br />
Stacking a class/spec that Blizzard just tought that it should be doing what it did, is not broken. And they just changed it because they're on their Crusade against Feral bleeds.<br />

&quot;Dominate the minds of 2/5 nearby humanoids, seizing control of their bodies for 20 sec. Immune to stuns and roots. Dominated players will walk towards Dominion portals which will spawn nearby, killing them instantly when they touch them. If you survive the dominion your next ability will deal 2000% more damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, obviously some abilities will deal more damage than others, why wouldn't you stack the class that has the best ability for this buff? Clearly Blizzard's fail on encounter design and not an exploit of any sort that Rip was doing the highest amount of damage with this buff. I wouldn't be surprised if someone here insisted that mages spellstealing on Omnotron is an exploit based on what I read here. It's an intended mechanic.</div></div><hr />

A log a feral druid on a fight with no gimmicks. Chimaeron 10N. rip was critting for an average of 18k. on average. when popped with mastery trinkets and tiger's fury, I've seen our feral druid have individual crits in the 30k range. In ten man. In mostly heroic gear.<br />
<br />
Given that Lappé, the druid that was featured with the 840k crits, has an average ilevel of 368, I'd expect him to be capable of a bit more than our druid with a 351 ilevel. Now, with the 2250% buff from siphon power, an ability will hit for 23.5 times as much. So, by dividing the enhanced hit by 23.5, we find what the original hit would have been for. <br />
<br />
840k/23.5 = 37,745 damage. Is that unreasonable to expect from a feral druid with 368 gear with all the on use trinkets and Tiger's fury all lined up? No, it is not. that's exactly what the buff says should happen, and that's what happened. rip is the highest damage per global ability in the game. Hence it does the most damage. Similar as Bane of Doom, which is why, despite Paragon NOT having 11 warlocks in the party, also got specifically removed from siphon power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And regarding to all the people that have no clue but tend to speak as if they would have one:<br />
No, 10men raids are not necessarily easier than 25men. There are several encounters where the 10men Version is by far (!) more difficult than the 25men version.<br />
Omnotron Defense System, Conclave of the Winds, Maloriak - just to name a few of them. Of course there also are some where 10men is clearly easier. Al'akir for example.<br />

And all those people who brought in Locks for Yogg0 were also exploiting, right? Because they were the most efficient DPS in the final phase? Right?<br />

As far as I see it, there should have been no encounter within the game that would have designed around bringing 11-12 of a single class. This whole &quot;Clever use of game mechanics&quot; is a load.<br />
They can go all day with the things like &quot; it was pretty damn scary watching Sinestra almost die to it by accident&quot; and try and try to make it sound like they do the right thing when it comes to intended design of the encounters but as complicated or as simple as you want to put it, they all started that Nefarian attempt knowing full well that needing 10+ of a single class was not the intentional design of it.</div></div><hr />

What I don't like is that they realising this brought all druids they had and downed him. This meant they were aware of what they where doing and that they had an active choice, which they made. And since they then couldn't down Nefarian the next week after this was hotfixed, I lost even more respect for Paragon. I'm sorry but; this isn't something to be proud of.<br />
<br />
Not trying to defend Ensidia, but if they had brought 11 Rogues to Lich King for the Saronite Bombs in Phase 2, I would have considered these situations the same. It is not realising that an encounter has a bug which is the problem, it is what you with this new information.</div></div><hr />

The thing is, you don't need the cats to kill him - regular guilds will be able to do it in time, once they've been going through the content and gearing up right. Check out the armory for the guild leader, or the mage languishing below all those blue kitties - they're not all in purples yet either - and even the purples are half 359!

The encounter design fails if stacking a class is beneficial. It has been seen in a minor extent on various other bosses, did they exploit their kills too? There is no set in stone raid comp that all guilds must use to kill a boss. Finding out the best ability for the buff was a part of beating the encounter and it was only, and only Blizzards fault for overlooking Rip and Bane of Doom being too good for the mechanic which lead to this. On the other hand, copying Sinestra's skill and using it against her to kill her would have been a clear exploitation, that is not an intended mechanic unlike Dominion.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lór</div><div class="date">2011-01-31, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember the days when we switched more warlocks in the the group for enslaving Imps in Zul'Gurub, which made the trash laughable instead of threatening. I remember the days when we switched out cloth DPS for more rogues in the Gurtogg Bloodboil fight. I remember the days when we brought green and blue equipped rogues to Vaelastrasz, cause caster did suck there.<br />
<br />
You know what? Enslaving imps got changed, so the imp did not provide such a high damage boost anymore and the enslave broke easier. Gurtogg Bloodboil got never changed, so did Vaelastrasz. There are fights with damage improving abilities, that benefit some classes more than others. Blizz designed there a damage boost by a large amount and then ntoiced, that the damage boost was too high. So they changed it, to prevent class stacking and DPS numbers, that just break through the roof. The difference between this and an exploit is, that an exploit is something, that is used intentionally to prevent a basic mechanic of the encounter or to change the encounter in such a way, that a threatening ability loses its threat. <br />
<br />
Saronite Bombs by Ensidia were an exploit, because they used them to prevent losing space to move.<br />
Getting Freyas Buff to kill Hodir heroic was no exploit, because Ensidia did the encounter in the right way, were not changing any mechanics of the fight, but did maximize their dps.<br />
Getting 11 druids into the raid at Nefarian is no exploit, but maximizing DPS and increasing the chance of the best DPS class getting mindcontrolled.<br />
It was no bug, but bad balancing, since the ability is meant to increase the damage of certain player's abilities. <br />
Doing absurd high damage to Sinestra through DK skills was an obvious bug, not a balancing flaw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The buff to damage applies to all classes that have DoTs, so Paragon brought in the class with the best DoT. What's the problem? You bring the class that will yield the maximum damage for your raid. They can afford the luxury of bringing in the most advantageous class and spec, as I'm sure many other top guilds can.<br />
<br />
But after the yogg0 kill locks werent nerfed to do less dmg.<br />

In this case something changed after the first kill. In the yogg case other guilds could acctualy redo the kill like the guild before them. In the nef case people could not. Here is all the difference.</div></div><hr />

This. When are people going to accept that the druid thing wasnt an exploit. Rip scaled the best so they stacked druids. Just because those Fins had/leveled druids ready, then its not their problems. All this fallout is because Blizzard hotfixed one of the mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard fixed the saronite thing and banned ensidia and took their loot and achievements away. Blizzard fixed the nef buff but didnt ban paragon and they kept the achievements and loot. Believe me they ARE looking at what was going on when a guild kills a boss for a wf. Even when you are considering it an exploit its still on blizzards side to decide if it was an actual exploit or clever use of game mechanics. So if they decide it wasnt one ... than it wasnt one. Period. Here is all the difference.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Uzkin</div><div class="date">2011-01-31, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There still seems to be a lot of confusion about Paragon's Nef kill, so let me repeat the facts:<br />
<br />
(1) There were no bugs or exploits involved with Paragon's kill. The kill was legit, and the feral druids' Rip was working correctly in combination with the dominate buff. The math about Rip has been done earlier on this thread, and the numbers check out. Please learn again your basic calculus if you don't agree. Or rest assured that Blizzard thoroughly checks through the combat logs of every world first kill for possible exploiting of bugs, and swiftly bans any offenders.<br />
<br />
(2) Class stacking is allowed by Blizzard. When that happens, Blizzard usually reacts by implementing balancing changes. These changes occur all the time, and do not &quot;posthumously&quot; affect who is entitled to a world first and who isn't. Otherwise all the first kills would become invalid after almost every patch.<br />
<br />
Finally, the guilds don't have any say in Blizzards decisions to change boss mechanics. All the top guilds generally agree that such changes should not be made while the competition is still going on, even if they are the one to get advantage of it. In this respect, Method has also been in a similar situation back when they killed Hodir HM first in Ulduar only to have Blizzard make the fight (nearly) impossible right after they had killed it.</div></div><hr />

It can't be even considered clever use of game mechanics. They got a buff and used an ability to attack the boss as intended, normal use of game mechanics. The ability just happened to do very good damage, which blizzard overlooked.</div></div><hr />

If this mechanic was changed then paragon should have had their titles stripped and world first removed and they can kill it how all the other guilds have to kill it. It was obviously not intended and also not changed fast enough but rip hitting for 400k-800k is just an abuse of game mechanics. Other guilds get banned for abusing stuff that gets changed or is not working as it was intended to... They should be no exception.<br />

I was just pointing out the difference between the yogg0 and the nef kill. Im not on any guilds side or anything but it would be really nice if Blizz would treat any kind of &quot;it was not ment to be killed like this&quot; as equal.<br />
<br />
I honestly really cant trust their judgement of what is a bannable exploit or clever use of game mechanics (as stupid as it sounds) coz IMO Blizz really doesnt care about any &quot;fair race&quot; but they want the content to last long (imo nef wasnt ment to be killed the first of the last bosses) so when they see a guild who can push it to the limit they have to do something.<br />
<br />

If it just was that simple in WoW, it's not like they are playing against each other at a LAN event. Maybe taking loot, achievements and reseting the boss so that they could keep attempting it would have been appropriate.</div></div><hr />

I already addressed all those issues in my previous post, I suggest you read it more carefully this time. A short summary: using Rip was not an abuse, it was working correctly with the encounter-specific buff. I can give you links to some online material on elementary mathematics if you want to learn the basics and check it for yourself. Also, Blizzard does not take world firsts away every time they adjust or balance something. If they did, Method would also be losing world firsts.</div></div><hr />

What mechanics were not working as intended?<br />
<br />
When a player's mind control breaks, they gain a 2250% damage increase (150 stacks of a 15% damage buff called Stolen Power). That's part of the fight. It works on DoTs.<br />
<br />
This is Stolen Power: http://www.wowhead.com/spell=80624 (I had to link WoWHead because MMO-DB is already on the PTR version of 5%). See the part where it says &quot;Damage and healing of your next spell or ability is increased by 15%.&quot; Note the big shiny &quot;150&quot; on the icon. You get 150 stacks as part of the fight.<br />
<br />
Paragon thought - hey, who has the best DoT in the game? Feral Druids! Let's stack Feral Druids due to their survivability and their awesome DoT.<br />
<br />
ASK Method! I'm sure they used DKs and Mages for Festering Strikes and Combustion. Instead of 800k Rip ticks, they're getting 500-600k Combustion or other DoT ticks (unless the Stolen Power PTR nerf is live). What's the difference?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Props to Method, FTH, and Paragon. This level of content has been very difficult to say the least. Not 1 boss was a complete pushover and there were several fights that really tested the &quot;hardcore&quot; players/guilds to really achieve a EU/US/World first. I have great respect for all my piers in the top tier raiding scene and am honored to be amongst you all.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this content, although hard, was quite buggy. No one knows the complete truth unless they are there for the kill and for the discussion of the strategy. Blizzard left gaping holes for guilds like Paragon who always manage to think outside the box, it isn't their fault, it's the game developers. I give Blizzard a lot of credit for this tier of raiding, but they simply need a better testing team that can find these holes before these guilds get to them and defeat the boss. It simply isn't right that the first Nef kill was accomplished by the means it was and then fixed so other guilds never held the same advantages. If vodka was in Paragon's position we would have done the same on Nefarion, no doubt in my mind. This isn't cheating or avoiding encounter mechanics, to me it's a miscalculation on Blizzard which led to an intelligent use of game mechanics. (PS. Can someone please show me a top tier first kill video of a legit Atremetes kill that I keep hearing rumors about!)<br />
<br />
In regard to 10 man kills. I'm open to a discussion about which fights are harder/easier, but it would most likely just turn into a immature argument. For now I'll just request that websites keep the two separate. If there is one thing we can all agree with is it's not the same like Blizzard claimed it would be. Running this tier of content in a 25/10 man fashion held unique problems and challenges for both sides. There should simply be separation, that's it.<br />
<br />
Special props to Method/FTH for really shining through for this tier. Although I am quite proud of my guild for this tier there is much work to be done to get the US to a more competitive world first level. The US simply needs to step it up a few notches. I urge the rest of the US to keep pushing and for one of us to show these EU guilds we are on the same level. No excuses!<br />
<br />
On a final note, the trolls, the trash talkers, the &quot;fanboys&quot;, please keep an open mind about things... &quot;It's just a game&quot; after all...<br />

<br />
On the PTR, Stolen Power works exactly the same way. It's just 5% instead of 15%, for a total of a 750% multiplier vs 2250%.<br />
<br />
From what Paragon has said on these forums, it -sounds like- it is still 2250% on Live. It just doesn't work with Rip or Bane of Doom.<br />
<br />
If the 5% nerf is Live, then my mistake.<br />
<br />
Diamondtear from Paragon in another thread:<br />
<br />
FYI, Stolen Power did exactly what the tooltip said it would. It still does. Just not for Bane of Doom and Rip.<br />
which makes me think that Stolen Power is unchanged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you're comparing this to a completely intentional 2250% damage increase that Paragon decided to use on the best DoT in the game. There's no external mechanic or gimmick at work here. Feral druids do the most damage on Nefarian. They stacked Feral Druids.<br />

now thats a lie, saronite bombs used on LK fight made the collapsed part of the place to be rebuilt back, which allowed to ignore completly the valks mechanic, its NOT how this was suppose to work, soranites bombs mechanic was to do some dmg, collapsed part of the fighting place, did not suppose to be rebuilt during valks phase. unlike paragons case, all mechanics was working AS THEY SUPPOSE TO, its just the dmg was too high, just because the scaling of those dots, was too high with dmg. nothing wrong happen, at all . btw, now when rip and bane of doom nerfed, maybe stack affli locks?! soul drain crits for 50k with all procs up? 2250% on it may mean 1million dmg ticks.</div></div><hr />

Or rest assured that Blizzard thoroughly checks through the combat logs of every world first kill for possible exploiting of bugs, and swiftly bans any offenders.<br />

If this mechanic was changed then paragon should have had their titles stripped and world first removed and they can kill it how all the other guilds have to kill it. It was obviously not intended and also not changed fast enough but rip hitting for 400k-800k is just an abuse of game mechanics. Other guilds get banned for abusing stuff that gets changed or is not working as it was intended to... They should be no exception.<br />

Paragon didn't get world first nefarian kill Method did.<br />

No matter how you put it it just doesn't make sense that using an intended game mechanic should get them banned because Ensidia got banned for an unintended mechanic, Saronite Bombs just were never supposed to rebuild the platform, whereas Rip was supposed to do damage when used with Stolen Power. For how much? Too much for sure, but that doesn't change the fact that Rip was supposed to be used as a damaging ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rip being affected by the buff nef gives was nerfed VERY fast after the initial kill.<br />
If you look at paragon's raids after the nef kill, they didn't even attempt it after the hotfix. This meant paragon was the only guild who could've abused this combo (I say abuse, but in blizz's terms &quot;creative use of game mechanics&quot;) for a while, till nef was &quot;nerfed&quot; (IE scaling the encounter down to a level it was supposed to be to begin with).<br />
<br />
All in all this is the same as Ensidia's Hodir kill: they used a certain combination of skills available to them to maximize DPS.<br />
What guilds like Ensidia on LK and Exodus on Yog 0 keepers did was using a BUG (something unintentional that blizz didn't see) to completely bypass certain abilities of the boss, trivializing the encounter.<br />
<br />
PS.<br />
Ensidia's LK kill is still up for debate until they show a vid, but so far they haven't and I don't think they ever will. But Blizz banned them, so I'm gonna go with the &quot;they abused the bombs&quot; theory.</div></div><hr />

I have the same question. In sunwell everyone stacked shamans for chain heros. It wasn't exploiting then, and it wasn't considered exploiting later when Blizzard changed the ability to prevent it from happening in wrath.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't matter what kind of exploit it is, it's still an exploit, tho you can hardly blame guilds for using the bugged mechanic, not paragon not ensidia or everyone else for that, the only one to blame here is Blizzard. So banning guilds from the get-go was a mistake on their side. <br />
<br />
Whatever you abuse that should not happen in the fight is exploiting, may it be dots that all of a sudden tick for a million or using in-game items to cause a glitch is in the same basket of exploiting. <br />
<br />
It's all called exploiting, considering Blizzard is for obvious reasons listening to the top guilds, either one of them could have opened a ticked (or other means of communication they have) about the glitches, before trying to finally kill the boss, but alas all top guilds just want to get the bosses down with the minimum of resistance so all glitches/exploits come in handy, except for those which kill the raid in one second, on those they somehow open tickets instantly and complain. <br />
<br />
in short, same shit - different package.</div></div><hr />

Same goes for class, blizz say that they should be balance, are they? NO.<br />
<br />
And yeah agree prob not the best example to take, but still, my point is that they are 2 completely different istance, for a number of reason, starting from the need of only 10 good player, ending to the fact that spreading 10player is easier that 25player, with a lot more of reason between. The design of boss can be the same, but the method to kill it is not.<br />
<br />
It's pretty clear that you have not played 10 and 25 man in Cata, but many of the bosses are more difficult to down on 10 man. There is just no room for any mistakes. 25 take more organization, but with the exception of the few bosses where spreading out is key (there aren't that many, if you haven't noticed) 25 man provide more flexibility.</div></div><hr />

Because it clearly indicates that the damage of Rip in this encounter was unintended and Blizzard felt it should not be this way ever again.<br />
<br />
It doesn't bother me that they did it this way. Who wouldn't have done it that way if they were able?<br />

<br />
I mean, Dark Similacrum works as intended, doesn't it? It copies a spell, doesn't it? Wrack is a spell, isn't it? Spell Reflection reflects spells, doesn't it? By your fanboy logic, that's not a bug exploit, that's not an unintended mechanic, that's a normal mechanic, and using it would have made for a perfectly legitimate kill. Normal skill used in a normal way, right? I mean hell, it's part of a normal person's regular spell arsenal. How is it any different than Rip? They're both normal uses of normal abilities, and both were changed after the fact because they were deemed to be doing unintentional things.<br />
<br />
If stacking Rip for Heroic Nef kill is not abuse, then neither is reflecting Wrack. They're identical.</div></div><hr />

Compared to a Fire Mage group of 11, doing massive DPS? (probably around 3-4 million instead of 4-5 million, but really, what is the difference?)<br />

Why would Blizzard give you a 2250% damage buff in an encounter and not expect you to do damage with it?!<br />

If stacking Rip for Heroic Nef kill is not abuse, then neither is reflecting Wrack. They're identical.<br />
<br />
Except Dark Simulacrum doesn't work on boss abilities 99.9% of the time. Definitely not on boss abilities that hit you for a stacking portion of HP, so you can reflect it on the boss and do a metric bijillion damage.<br />
<br />
Blizzard gives all MC'd players a 2250% damage buff. Rip was only slightly more effective than Combustion, or Blood Plague with an extension, or other abilities. The unnerfed abilities, like Combustion, are arguably more effective than Bane of Doom, which was patched.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong or unintended about the way they did the fight. There are so many poor analogies in this thread.<br />

Afterwards, Blizzard thought &quot;Wow, this promotes too much class stacking, let's change it&quot;. That doesn't invalidate previous legitimate kills.</div></div><hr />

On Sinestra encounter Paragon stated that they noticed that Dark Simulacrum(DK's new toy) could almost one-shoot the boss, and they clearry identified that it was not intended, which is intuitive.<br />
<br />
On another fight, they noticed that one class could do enormous amount off damage, 3 times more than every other class(as you can see on damage meter), and yet some fanboys states that they thought it was by design.<br />
<br />
Hypocrism? Why didnt they use DS in Sinestra, hell its all about world first, no matter how, right? They just thought that with DS they wouldn't pass unnoticed, on Nef they just took the risk and EXPLOITED it and it paid off. Period.</div></div><hr />

Uh, except every single ability in the game works with Stolen Power, not just Rip.<br />

Fire Mages can still use Combustion on heroic Nefarian right now for multi-million damage Combustions. It's only very slightly less damage than Rip.<br />

If you all still wants to go on with this &quot;exploit&quot; or &quot;not explot&quot; war, thers one significiant thing to mention.<br />
<br />
On Sinestra encounter Paragon stated that they noticed that Dark Simulacrum(DK's new toy) could almost one-shoot the boss, and they clearry identified that it was not intended, which is intuitive.<br />
<br />
On another fight, they noticed that one class could do enormous amount off damage, 3 times more than every other class(as you can see on damage meter), and yet some fanboys states that they thought it was by design.<br />
<br />
Hypocrism? Why didnt they use DS in Sinestra, hell its all about world first, no matter how, right? They just thought that with DS they wouldn't pass unnoticed, on Nef they just took the risk and EXPLOITED it and it paid off. Period.<br />
<br />
No, not 3 times more than every class. There were like maybe 4-5 non-feral-druid-DPS.<br />
<br />
They said themselves they could have just as easily stacked Fire Mages and DKs and spent a few more hours and got a kill.<br />
<br />
Here:<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the essence of the problem.<br />
<br />
If you have an encounter where the dps potential of classes are like this (numbers not accurate, but probably in the ballpark):<br />
<br />
Druid - 50k<br />
DK - 45k<br />
Mage - 43k<br />
...<br />
Rogue - 26k<br />
Warrior - 22k<br />
<br />
Are druids balanced overall in that totem pole? Of course not. Everyone can immediately see that. They're dealing almost 2.5x the damage of the bottom classes. What about DKs or Mages then?<br />
<br />
This is roughly what the damage potential looks like on Nefarian. It is very hard to justify bringing a Warrior instead of a DK or a Druid. If you take that replacement one step further - what if you had the option of bringing 10 Mages? Or 10 DKs? What about 10 feral Druids? At which point is it not okay to bench a lesser dps for a better one?<br />
<br />
Some would argue that that it's at zero. Others would say it's somewhere below 10, but not at 10. That's entirely up to you. <br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that raid setup optimizations like this play a big role in the top raiding game. You find what yields the best results and go with it. On every single encounter. That is why you see such two-colored healing comps for example. That's why we benched melee on Ascendant Council. <br />
<br />
There is no clear way of evaluating what is ok and what is not. I'm sure the developers intend for the game and encounters to be balanced, but that doesn't happen in reality. Every single world first kill (and I really do mean every single one) uses something that is not in line with design intent, from class stacking to straight out exploiting - usually it's just bringing 3-5 of the highest dps classes. You could say that half of the whole top raiding game is about finding imbalances and using them. Perhaps we get some communication errors from being too numb to that. <br />
<br />
Bottom line: we thought Rip was imbalanced, but not too imbalanced. Like so many things on so many encounters before. Which is exactly why we brought 10 feral Druids. It may be stretching the boundaries, but that's only a good thing - perhaps there will now be less encounters that have mechanics like this that inherently cause massive imbalances between classes.<br />
xaar of Paragon - the top feral druid in that video (usually plays Resto I think?)<br />

<br />
If they brought 5 Feral Druids, 5 Fire Mages, and 5 Unholy DKs and used their Stolen Powers for Rips, Combustions, and 1 DK disease (extended via Festering), would you be okay with that kill?<br />
<br />
It's not remotely an exploit to use a 2250% damage increase on a DoT because DoTs are better than nukes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druid damage on that fight was only so high because of how Rip scaled with the buff.. Paragon were the best guild at the end of Wrath so they needed to keep that spot.. which obviously meant they need to find the most effective ways to kill a boss.<br />
If Wrack was used to kill Sinestra, they could basically avoid most of the fight (I think) due to not having to deal with adds(?) because they would kill her so fast, on Nefarian.. they still got close to the enrage timer but druids were just the highest scaling dmg source for that fight.. they still had to deal with every part of the fight.</div></div><hr />

15% damage increase at 150 stacks is 2250% increased damage.<br />
<br />
You get this after every mind control. It's just Blizzard giving an 'epic feel' to a fight by making the boss have a TON more health than usual, and giving you a damage buff to compenstate (Sinestra is the same way, you get 100% haste and infinite resources for 3 minutes).</div></div><hr />

They happened to have 11 druids because Rip scaled better with the 2250% damage buff you get (damage buff is intended) than other classes DoTs - how is that an exploit?</div></div><hr />

Once again: There was no Rip bug. Rip was working correctly with the Stolen Power buff, this is a mathematical fact. It was (and apparently still is) possible to get crits exceeding 1M damage by using that buff, it is an intended part of the fight. It was not an exploit to use Rip, just as it is not an exploit to use Combustion or any other high DPCT ability now.<br />
<br />
It also seems necessary to point out again that class stacking is allowed by Blizzard. It has been allowed ever since WoW came out, and Blizzard has not made any statements that the amount of characters of a certain class should be kept below [insert an arbitrary limit] in a raid. Indeed, there have been full 25-paladin raids as well as full 25-druid raids, and Blizzard has allowed them to keep their kills and loot.</div></div><hr />

Doing absurd damage is the point of the fight, otherwise they wouldn't give you a 2250% damage buff, and the combined hp pool of the encounter wouldn't be 50-100 million more HP than any other fight.</div></div><hr />

What they were doing with Rip? They were timing all cooldowns and trinkets and stuff with it, yeah, it's very comparable.<br />

<br />
Spell reflect typically doesn't affect major boss abilities, damage buffs typically affect rip. That's the difference.<br />
<br />
The people saying that this is the same as ensidia's use of Saronite bombs or exodus' brain room glitch are absurd, you obviously have no idea of how either encounter was coded. <br />
<br />
With exodus. they put a pair of players in an position that is meant to be unobtainable through divine intervention, then aggro'd the spawning mobs, causing them to evade glitch due to not being able to reach their highest aggro target. The moment &quot;Evade!&quot; pops up, you've hit an unintended mechanic.<br />
<br />
With the Lich King, the encounter uses terrain constructs for the outer edge of the platform, similar to the floor in ToC. The contructs have a limited amount of health, and enter a different state when they are low on health. The lich King has two abilities, one which damages them enough to change state, another that heals them back to the original state. However, the health values are very low, and when they took extra damage from the grenades, they were pushed into negative health, which glitched the construct and caused it to reset to full health. This is especially damning for ensidia, because they got a glitch involving grenades and the terrain constructs in ToC discovered and fixed on the patch 3.2 ptr.<br />
<br />
Nefarian was poorly tuned. It was not broken, it was not a bug. It did exactly what everyone who saw, or coded, the mechanic thought it would do. However, once they saw what paragon did, they thought it encouraged too much class stacking, and decided to retune it to close the gap between warlocks and druids on that fight, and classes withwithout a strong refreshable dot, like warriors and ret pallies. If you think everyone who got a kill on a boss that was later retuned should have their gear and achievements stripped, then every raiding toon would be naked after every hotfix they implement. Hell, Method used grounding totems on double dragons to mitigate blackout, which was hotfixed, they also used the door glitch on atramedes, which was also hotfixed. Both of those are a lot more questionable than class stacking for extra damage. Every guild that has downed Heroic Atramedes has done so via some sort of glitch, be it the infinite gonglock or the wall of justice. So I guess no one is a legitimate 13/13.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can look at it like this:<br />
<br />
- 25 mans take more effort to coordinate. Sure BUT..<br />
- 25 mans have vastly more ranges of margins of error to boot, where you can lose more than 2.5x's the players and still complete an encounter. Plus there's more interrupts and cc's to throw around as well.<br />
<br />
In that, 10 mans, especially due to the trending overtuning by blizzard, is the harder scenario this time around. Maybe blizzard will address this next time content hits, 6 months from now (most likely unfortunately).</div></div><hr />

Wrong.<br />
It never worked with many abilities, for example Arcane Missiles, Festering Strike, but notably Deep Freeze and Starfall. <br />
Deep Freeze crits for 140k -&gt; 3M with Stolen Power.<br />
Starfall -&gt; 1.5M<br />
<br />
Blizzard deliberately made those 2 OP abilities unaffected by Stolen Power, to prevent stacking of frost mages or boomkins.<br />

<br />
<br />
It's not a broken mechanic, it's part of the fight...<br />
It is broken mechanic. Blizzard disabled Deep Freeze and Starfall, but overlooked Rip.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fire Mages can still use Combustion on heroic Nefarian right now for multi-million damage Combustions. It's only very slightly less damage than Rip.<br />
Combustion is on 2 min cooldown. It requires huge DoTs in order to be effective. It doesn't work on amplified (via stolen power) Living Bomb, and it doesn't work on amplified Pyroblast DoT. It works only on Ignite produced by amplified Pyroblast crit.<br />
Pyroblast has 50% to crit (with t11x4 and glyph of pyroblast).<br />
If are lucky to crit, Pyro+Combustion will do total of 2.5M damage.<br />
In practice, you are able to use Combustion on average 1.5 times during the fights. Rip you could use every time you were MCed.</div></div><hr />

Festering strike worked with the buff, it didn't add the buff to any dots it refreshed, but it hit a ton harder with siphon power. It did however, refresh a disease that was amplified, which is why mancheese was fairly close behind the druids, because everytime he was mind controlled he could IT, then roll that amped FF for longer with festering strike, wheras the ferals could only refresh their amped rip during the phase three MCs.</div></div><hr />

Seems so, but a lot of the remaining spells are also just as broken as stuff like Starfall and Bane of Doom, right? (over 1.5 Million)<br />
<br />
It seems like killing Nefarian in his current state using spells that do over 1.5 Million is still 'unintended' (This is obvious - Stolen Power is only 5% per stack on the PTR).<br />
<br />
I don't blame Paragon for this, or Method (I'm sure some of their spells were still over 1.5 Million), and I really don't think anyone should, to be honest.<br />
<br />
The blame is with Blizzard here - it's a flat out bad buff design, and so was their Sinestra buff (+100% haste when every class has radically different haste values = sadface).</div></div><hr />

The term troll and hater has become so overused on MMO-Champ, that hardly anyone even knows what the words even mean anymore. As for the kill, whether or not this was an exploit, or just a &quot;clever use of mechanics&quot;, I'll let that continue to be argued. This particular kill though was meant to kill the boss, not meant to be fair or flashy. Paragon only cared about killing the boss as fast as they could so they could be the best. They saw an opening (rip ticks faster and deals more damage) and took it by stacking Druids.<br />
<br />
To me? This is an unethical kill, not an exploit, not a bug, but very unethical. The fight, as many fail to realize, was meant to be done with teamwork, using multitudes of classes, as with any fight, not taking a single class and downing it. You really think Paragon took 11 Druids by chance? They knew of this open door and decided to take the easy kill to world first. That's all there is to it.<br />

This wasn't an exploit, but it was definitely an unethical kill. But hell, in the world of WoW, whatever gets your e-peen harder, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

I know that your disappointment is not directed at us, but I'm inclined to comment along the same lines I did to you elsewhere.<br />
<br />
The OP big hits you are talking of weren't dots -- that was a consistent pattern in the abilities that were originally excluded from the mechnic. I am unsure why they designed it as they did, because Deep Freeze and *definitely* Starfall aren't anything special. The vast majority of dots work(ed) on the encounter, and that included the real big hitters. Notably fire mages, unholy dks, and moonkins all match or eclipse the potential of Deep Freeze with their dots -- or in the case of dks, rolling dots.<br />
<br />
Just to be on the safe side, I went to bash a training dummy. Self-buffed, with abysmal crit, I was consistently pulling off 100-150k trinketed Sunfires. That equals up to 3.5M hits pretty much every MC. In reality (if I take a mage's word for it...), trinketed Pyro+Combustion also deals around 4M. Our top fire mage was averaging 40k dps throughout the whole fight on the rekill, which would have placed him #3 or #4 on the original epeen-meters. These dots might not be Rip, but they're not really that far off. <br />
<br />
(Would actually have images of those, but apparently I can't post any!)<br />
<br />
The fight is better off without feral stacking, but what they should have done is to take all dots out from the table. It doesn't make sense for *any* ability to hit upwards of 3.5M, when half the classes are stretching to even get to seven figures. It certainly is a broken mechanic -- and I think even more so than you're portraying, because the problem isn't limited to Rip. It was just the tip of the iceberg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, there is a small difference between 1.5M, and 4-5M :/<br />
There is a difference between 40k dps (our top dps), and 70k dps (Paragon's top dps).<br />
<br />
And TBH, I don't know of many spells that can do 1.5M now. Except Combustion, which is on 2min CD and requires a crit.<br />
Arcane mage - 600k (Arcane Blast, 400k non crit, 800k crit)<br />
Hunter - 1M (Explosive Shot).<br />
Warlock - 1M (Immolate).<br />
Boomkin - 1.2M (Moonfire)<br />
xaar posted that Sunfire can pull off 3.5 - hm, maybe.<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems like killing Nefarian in his current state using spells that do over 1.5 Million is still 'unintended'.<br />
<br />
I don't blame Paragon for this, or Method (I'm sure some of their spells were still over 1.5 Million), and I really don't think anyone should, to be honest.<br />
LOL :D Yeah, certainly... Blizzard forgot that they left &quot;Siphon Power&quot; on Nefarian... Well, Blizzard left the buff for something. After few hotfixes we'll know what were their &quot;intentions&quot; :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The blame is with Blizzard here - it's a flat out bad buff design, and so was their Sinestra buff (+100% haste when every class has radically different haste values = sadface).<br />
Well, it brings imbalance into DPS classes, because as you noticed, haste scales differently for everyone. But on Sinestra it didn't work bad at all. It works amazingly well on Sinestra.<br />

By the way, I'm spamming this topic, but please don't read me wrong:<br />
I'm telling that Blizzard failed and left broken mechanics on Nefarian, but I'm far from blaming Paragon.<br />
<br />
Paragon didn't use bugs. (Well, right now you could call it a &quot;bug&quot;, only because it was fixed... But when they were raiding it wasn't ^^) <br />
Druids were doing OP damage -&gt; use druids. That's simple. It's retarded to blame for that.<br />
<br />
Blizzard made 2 mistakes:<br />
1. Overlooked Rip (or even many other things with Stolen Power).<br />
2. Fixed Rip, after Nefarian was killed with feral druids. (So other guilds had harder task, and this is pretty much the only reason why we were upset).</div></div><hr />

Modesty isn't the best policy anymore?) I love to read the &quot;LOLUMAD&quot; and &quot;troll slayer&quot; arguments that litter these threads. The term troll and hater has become so overused on MMO-Champ, that hardly anyone even knows what the words even mean anymore. As for the kill, whether or not this was an exploit, or just a &quot;clever use of mechanics&quot;, I'll let that continue to be argued. This particular kill though was meant to kill the boss, not meant to be fair or flashy. Paragon only cared about killing the boss as fast as they could so they could be the best. They saw an opening (rip ticks faster and deals more damage) and took it by stacking Druids.<br />
<br />
To me? This is an unethical kill, not an exploit, not a bug, but very unethical. The fight, as many fail to realize, was meant to be done with teamwork, using multitudes of classes, as with any fight, not taking a single class and downing it. You really think Paragon took 11 Druids by chance? They knew of this open door and decided to take the easy kill to world first. That's all there is to it.<br />
<br />
This wasn't an exploit, but it was definitely an unethical kill. But hell, in the world of WoW, whatever gets your e-peen harder, I suppose.<br />
<br />
Do you think Method just &quot;Happened&quot; to kill Atramedes in the doorway?<br />
Do you think Premonition just &quot;Happened&quot; to devote an entire group to kiting adds in omnitron's room?<br />
Do you think Ensidia just &quot;Happened&quot; to stack tanks on Halfus?<br />
<br />
If you think 11 druids makes the fight an &quot;easy kill&quot;, then you have no idea of the difficulty of the encounter. To get world firsts, you have to push things to the edge. Class stacking to take advantage of mechanics? Fine. Having lowbie warlocks SSing your whole raid? Go for it. Kiting adds blizzard intended for you to burn down? knock yourself out. Off tanking drakes you're supposed to burn down? Nice trick. Zerging through a fight with hard DPS? More power to you.<br />
<br />
Pretty much, as long as you're not evade tricking mobs, or causing things to reset, then you're within the rules of the game. I consider people who stand on the statue for Lockmaw more worthy of a chastisement than paragon for stacking druids.</div></div><hr />

No kidding. Clearly neither this nor Sinestra should have gone live without a little more testing. I mean Dark Simulacrum, okay, that is kind of an underused spell, I can see that, but things like missing the Twilight Flames, and Stolen Power doing too much damage with some (many) spells would have been very obvious after only a few playtests. :&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
True. I think though to maybe decrease the class imbalance, they could do something like +25% Sta/Str/Agi/Int/Spi and +25% Haste/Crit/Mastery and make it multiplicative with current debuffs and buffs. Then if there is an issue where one class outperforms another, it needs to be addressed anyway because it will happen in a future tier!<br />
<br />
Still, I suppose they have to mix things up, and seeing the same buff on every end boss to 'boost your raid up to the level you can kill them' would get old fast.<br />

Where did I say you felt it was anything other than unethical or an &quot;Easy kill&quot;? It's your own concern if you feel it's unethical, I would simply say that if you single this out amongst all the other atypical raid comps that various guilds have used to get world firsts then you're being hypocritical. <br />
<br />
But it being an easy kill is pretty much factually wrong. raid stacking of one sort or another is pretty much required, and no inferior DPS specs could be entertained. But it would have been doable with a combo of warlocks, mages, and DKs if you didn't want to bring a feral druid. Bringing that many feral druids meant they couldn't push any electrocutes in phase two, meaning that the phase three commenced with nef having over 60% of his health remaining. If they had brought a combo of mages and warlocks, they could have pushed a few crackles in phase two, and entered phase 3 with him at between 30% and 40% health, and had phase three be substantially shorter. But that would have required reworking the strat they were running, and probably a few more hours of wipes. But it was just as feasible.</div></div><hr />

Well in that case I'm sorry, I am not looking at this any differently from other &quot;clever uses of mechanics&quot;, its all the same to me, a trick of the trade used to win the &quot;race&quot; quicker.<br />
<br />
While I agree with you that raid stacking is required now, especially in Cata (Gods only know why Blizzard thought these raid stack fights were smart, it only ostracizes people more), I still feel that 11 Druids is overkill, and was used to gain an edge that teetered on the fragile and often over abused precipice of ethics.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I still think this is a hard encounter, even on normal mode, but I still stand by my stance that 11 Druids was purposely used to gain an unethical, tactful edge on a hard fight, simply to claim victory in a &quot;race&quot; against other guilds. To me, if this silly &quot;race&quot; never existed, we'd probably see a lot less of these kills in general.</div></div><hr />

Are 400-600k ticks of other spells okay with you then?<br />

Because you can go to Nefarian right now and do over 2 million shields of righteousness. Read the comments above.<br />

The kill was legit, and the feral druids' Rip was working correctly in combination with the dominate buff. The math about Rip has been done earlier on this thread, and the numbers check out. Please learn again your basic calculus if you don't agree. Or rest assured that Blizzard thoroughly checks through the combat logs of every world first kill for possible exploiting of bugs, and swiftly bans any offenders.<br />
<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
If this mechanic was changed then paragon should have had their titles stripped and world first removed and they can kill it how all the other guilds have to kill it. It was obviously not intended and also not changed fast enough but rip hitting for 400k-800k is just an abuse of game mechanics. Other guilds get banned for abusing stuff that gets changed or is not working as it was intended to... They should be no exception.<br />
<br />
Paragon didn't get world first Nefarian kill Method did.<br />
<br />
This video clearly showing paragon abusing mechanics that arenot working as intended should not be up on the front page.<br />
<br />
From what i read, Paragon should have their title, loot and world first stripped from them because they did the fight legit, and followed the mechanics set in front of them... Nice logic there. Also no matter how you look at it Paragon got Nef down to 0% first in the world and Method got Nef down to 0% second in the world therefore Paragon is world first and Method is world second. Also not once did blizzard say that the fight was not working as intended to... they changed it because they didn't like the decision they made... Also by your logic using saronite bombs to completely exclude a major part of a fight is the same exact thing as following all mechanics.</div></div><hr />

Okay, then the encounter is fail. It's a planned mechanic to have very high DoT ticks. Not 800k Rip ticks (apparently), but 400-600k ticks of other stuff. Apparently Blizzard thought that Rip promoted too much class stacking, so they changed it for future guilds. If it was against the -original- intent of the fight, Paragon would be banned.<br />
<br />
Stolen Power is part of the fight. Look it up on MMO-DB for the PTR version or Wowhead for the Live version. It's a 15% damage increase stacking 150 times for a total of 2250% damage on your next attack.<br />
<br />
That's how the fight was designed because Nefarian has a LOT more hp than other heroic bosses (especially when you add in Onyxia + adds).<br />
<br />
If Method released a video, the damage numbers would be inflated too. Not as much, sure. But they'd still be higher than the average fight because it is a mechanic that is part of the fight.</div></div><hr />

Still it makes the encounter much easier - otherwise they wouldn't have stacked druids that much. And easier than intended kill aka not working as intended kill means it was not a legit kill - you can twist the story as much as you want but you can't hide the facts.<br />

<br />
Heroic Nefarian is getting buffed again in 4.0.6 when Stolen Power is going down to 5% per stack instead of 15% buff stack.<br />
<br />
Does that mean Method's kill is not &quot;working as intended&quot;? Will it no longer be legit when the patch is released, further increasing the difficulty of Nefarian (assuming they don't lower his HP in the patch to compenstate, I guess)? What if Paragon got the first kill on Post-4.0.6 Nefarian?<br />
<br />
That's just not how the game works. Fight balance changes. Unless it is an exploit and they are banned, first kill is the first kill.</div></div><hr />

Paragon didn't release a vid of their atramedes kill, but it's pretty much assumed that every guild that's downed him has exploited the encounter to one degree or another.

Everyone agrees that Atramedes was bugged to crap.<br />

And yes, usually a world first guild exploits a bug then reports it so others can't use it. <br />

RIP and BANE OF DOOM were broken - they got hotfixed, they weren't working as intended.<br />
<br />
Combustion/ Shield of right. and any other skill you come up weren't - they didn't got a hotfix, that's why they didn't stacked any other class.<br />
<br />
The main problem here is: if paragon was under supervision (as all other top guilds on kills), WHY blizzard let them get the kill and then hotfixed it? And if they hotfixed, why they didn't strip Paragon first kill - like they did with Ensidia LK saronite bomb case?<br />
<br />
Some ppl are biased and believe that having superdps isn't a bypass but take the example Ensidia Saronite bomb - if each bomb could rip off 50% of a valkyrie health instead of rebuilding the platform, wouldn't that be broken? Or would it be cleaver use of in-game mechanic or intended?<br />
<br />
Not to mention that superdps makes the fights last far shorter and shorter fights makes a lot of factors easier - nefarian case, slightly less harder.<br />
<br />
On this case, it was more Blizzard fault then Paragon, but it doesn't change that the kill had the use of acknowledge bugs - RIP/Bane of Doom.</div></div><hr />

The the valkyrs had some sort of debuff that made them take siege damage as actual damage, and the debuff was visible in the encounter, not through experimentation, but as a debuff. Then I promise you ensidia wouldn't have been banned. The debuff would probably be removed after guilds started killing it, because giving such a massive bonus to a profession is terrible game design, but no one would have been banned for using it, because it would have been working as intended. What ensidia did was force a terrain construct to reset by pushing it into negative health. It's a coding flaw, not a mechanic of the fight. Same with glitching adds to evade.</div></div><hr />
