Patch 6.2 - Orc Female Running Animation<br />
Orc Females got an update to their running animation, just like the Female Night Elf (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXKRgtsftos).<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 6.2 - Human Female Eyebrows<br />
Human females also had an adjustment in Patch 6.2. Their eyebrows were lowered.<br />

<br />
Remember, these are changes to upcoming set bonuses, not pure class balance. The goal is for all set bonuses to be roughly comparable (with some variance given their vastly different nature) in power, and there were clear outliers on both sides of the spectrum. The changes above represent our effort to correct some of those outliers. If you feel your spec is underperforming currently, the answer is not for a specific overpowered set bonus to prop it up, nor is the reverse true. <br />
<br />
If you feel that we missed the mark on changes based on your analysis of these specific bonuses, or that we may have overlooked some other bonuses that are also significantly too strong or too weak, we'd love to hear that feedback in this thread.<br />

Game Design and Choices<br />
Too much has been changed based on what people feel obligated to do to keep up with the Joneses.<br />
<br />
-People feel obligated to pick certain races due to racial abilities: Change racials.<br />
<br />
-People feel obligated to pick certain professions for the perks: Eliminate profession perks.<br />
<br />
-People feel obligated to run LFR to complete set bonuses or get other gear to help with progression: Nerf LFR into a snoozefest and remove all semblance of decent looking or interesting loot.<br />
<br />
-People feel obligated to have optimal specs and most people follow cookie cutter builds: Remove talent trees.<br />
<br />
-People feel obligated to bring certain specs to raid: Homogenize classes and specs.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I've left things off the list but I think you get the point. Stop it. Stop catering to peoples' self imposed obligations. Design some choice back into the game. I don't care it that choice is suboptimal. The vast majority of us are suboptimal players. If you're not chasing and achieving world rankings you're probably subobtimal and not picking the talent, race, profession, etc. that the world first player of your spec picked isn't going to hamper your game play. Play for fun, not to obligations.<br />
<br />
I'd be happy to agree with you, but in a game where a key component is the inter-reliance on each other to tackle difficult challenges, it in some ways requires players to at least consider what is optimal to ensure they're not letting other people down--or even just to keep from looking bad. Fear of judgment and self doubt are powerful social motivators. It's not as simple as personal choice, because in most cases its not, you're also making your choices based on how they'll impact everyone else you're playing with. <br />
<br />
That in no way addresses the point of the OP.<br />
Maybe I was speaking a bit beyond the specific issues the OP was bringing up. I wasn't intending to be so esoteric. My point was really just that suggesting people not care whether they're optimal or not--or that being suboptimal is more fun than being optimal--isn't as simple as personal choice; and that's even completely ignoring that first every player would need to have a realistic view of their own knowledge and skill.<br />
<br />
Man, the old talent trees were the worst. The sheer number of people that would complain about class balance, about high end progression tuning, about this or that, and when we'd look into it... it'd turn out they just didn't know what they were doing. They had gone for the ultra rare 16/16/19 build, or whatever, and the reason they absolutely hated the game is because, ultimately, we let them make the wrong choices. I think the cynical response is that it's their fault and they should just know to be better if they care, but it's the game that allowed it.<br />
<br />
It'd be real easy if everyone understood when they were making the suboptimal choices and were ok with it. That's just not how it works in practice.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm right there with you. I play the classes I want to because they're fun, not because they're high on someone's list. I make the fun choices I want to make. And I know that I'm only going to be able to see a certain level of difficulty because I make choices for my personal enjoyment rather than my desire to be optimal. I realize all of these things and I enjoy the game the way I want to enjoy it within the confines of the rules as they're defined by its design.<br />
<br />
But I am an individual. And millions of other individuals also play this game, and make their own choices, and have their own desires, and realizations.<br />
<br />
So the game literally cannot allow someone to fail on their choices?<br />
Actually that's a good point, and of course you can fail, but those failure/learning/growth opportunities are focused on actually playing your character, and not so much on reading a guide to know which powerups you have to choose.<br />
<br />
As much as we'd like to reward you for your Googling skillz. <br />
You say this yet with the implementation of crz and lfd, people have gone the downward slope of treating everyone like crap, and there is no recourse. Seems too me you failed at what you just said.<br />
<br />
I think you're referring to random people being mean to other random people on the internet, where I was more referring to situations like guild groups, or even PUGs, where people want to ensure the collective success of their group, if not their friends.<br />
<br />
Connecting strangers together to tackle group content is, I would think, always going to be subject to some amount of internet asshattery regardless of what that system is. The benefit of connecting people is by and large very positive, so if there any improvements you could recommend to help ease social tensions or ideas to make people nicer to each other, I think we'd be happy to hear them. But that's really a topic for a different thread.

They somewhat got away with it with SoO, it won't work again however. People are way to distraught with this expansion so far for that to work, the rushed 6.2 launch date is most likely due to some huge drop in Subs that Blizzy knows about, and we don't.<br />

Unholy needs the trinket and set to stay competitive now. Even then its lagging behind by around 1%. The trinket is a huge DPS boost without it your likely be doing significantly less than if you went DW.</div></div><hr />

It's coming out the exact same time as everyone who was predicting it, predicted it would come out and 7 months for X.2 is completely normal given every other expansion pack to date.<br />
<br />
I think people feel it is rushed due to several reasons.<br />
<br />
1. People predicted June 23 because Blizzard has a history of releasing their content to coincide with competition they deem as serious (despite their claims to not do this). Heavensward poses a threat this time around, because FF14 is adding flight on June 23, while WoW had a huge debate over the permanent removal of flight. Many people either quit to focus on work and school, or quit and started trying out other games, such as FF14.<br />
<br />
2. Look at the Watcher posts on the forums about set bonus feedback. Sure he is collecting feedback, but with like 3 days to go before the patch hits, 1 day if you don't count the weekend, since most of their staff won't be working. Most of the imbalances and bugs will likely carry over to live, and only to be hotfixed later, or delayed until 6.2.x. They had around 6 months of beta feedback for 6.0. Many issues with lengthy reports on beta forums, still went through to live. How much do you think they can do in 3 days?<br />
<br />
3. Combine 1 and 2, and you see how Blizzard had to release 6.2 on June 23, due to competition and business, not necessarily for the best game-play experience. After WoD, it is pretty safe to say that the Blizzard polish, what they were known for, is no longer there. They used to delay things just to get it right. Now it is all about meeting deadlines, quarter results, holiday sales rush, etc.</div></div><hr />

I'm kind of disappointed they didn't fix the bug where the female blood elf stops breathing if she sits down, however. The breathing animation isn't looping and stops. I don't think that would be complicated to fix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the prediction is from the Blizzard's patch life cycle of 6 months. Give or take a few weeks if there is some competition at that time. But it's around 6 months.<br />
<br />
The only doubt people had this time was if Blizzard would take 6 months from HM opening or BRF opening.<br />
<br />
The rushed thing is because the patch is not ready. The same way the expansion wasn't ready. Most people couldn't believe they would be able to release WoD at the promissed launch date. They did and we saw how bad things were. Too much stuff that needed attention, but they didn't have enough time.</div></div><hr />

Tinkering with your character to make him/her unique is a lot of fun for some people including myself. I love trading card games partly for this reason - I get to make my own decks, or even if I'm netdecking I can tinker with them to suit my taste. The new talent trees and the increasingly homogenized ability sets among all classes in the game have really reduced the ability of people to have their own unique character with the abilities that they want. <br />
<br />
It's sad to see the game go from one where there was more class diversity in the past than we have today. I always figured in a game like this would go the opposite way - more complexity and diversity as the game matured and peoples average skill level went up. Too bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's bigger change than nelf one. <br />
<br />
In nelf case they only toned the bounce down, in troll female case they changed the way she moved, from powerwalking she is now actually running. and her torso isn't so far ahead.<br />
<br />
And I believe people should still know about tweaks. Not everyone is checking PTR forums and not everyone is tracking model fixes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's true, but usually they rush for a good reason (business-wise). For example, they rushed out WoD in November, because they had to catch the holiday shopping season. This is very different from how they handled Burning Crusade, which was also supposed to release around the holiday season. Back then, Blizzard still upheld their philosophy of polish and quality, and they eventually delayed BC's launch into January. While missing the holiday period may seem bad at first, BC went on to be one of the most memorable expansions. WoD seems to be the opposite, where business and short term gains outweighs everything else.<br />
<br />
Also think of it this way: why would Blizzard rush this patch out? There is no real reason, other than to compete with FF14's expansion launch. They rushed out WoD due to holiday season. They need a reason to rush something out, because the Blizzard we know now, tend to take months just to fix boar running animations and add twitter integration.</div></div><hr />

What is the point of this comment? It's not &quot;funny&quot; or insightful or even constructively critical. Your opening premise makes so little sense that you had to explain it to all of us and barely accomplished that and i can't even decipher if you think the eyebrow change is a good change because now the human females are &quot;sexy&quot; or if you think its a bad change because...i dont even know what. Like you think the 3D modelers should skip this tweaking crap and go work on bringing daily quests back or some other nonsense that isn't their jobs. <br />
<br />
If you want the dev's to &quot;make the game fun to play again&quot; explain WHY you don't think it's fun and then offer some actual implementable suggestions on how to fix it that aren't just rollbacks to old designs. Who knows, maybe they will see it and at the very least, it will give all of US something to actually discuss here. <br />
<br />
If you you can't do that, what is the point of commenting? If you've already done that and don't feel your ideas are being heard, take your money and attention elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard works very hard and for a very long time to make awesome new exaggerated animations for the new race models, and then people who are afraid of change bitch and moan and cry and whine until Blizzard changes them back... They make the characters MORE stiff and LESS animated when running, because people QQ on the forums like it's their full time job. What the fuck is wrong with that picture?! I'm never subbing to this fucking game again if they alter the male orc animations to make them more stiff and less bouncy. At least add a god damn option in the game setting. If you worked long and hard to make GOOD animations, at least let us continue to use the fucking things. Let the people who like shitty stiff character models choose that option as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvP is my major activity in wow and has been for most of the time I have played. Ashran is awful. It is not a PvP game. Too many people in too small a place. Melee gets destroyed by ranged firing off AoE when PvP is actually happening. Most of the time people try to avoid others in order to do the events. I am not sure how this made it into the game as a PvP feature. Now they are making it all but, mandatory to do the thing in order to gear up in a timely manner. Not only that but, they are making it a worse experience by making it take even longer to get the &quot;bonus&quot; CP. They are definitely showing that they hate arenas by making them the absolute least rewarding part of PvP.<br />
<br />
My second most common activity in wow used to be professions and auction house play. They pretty much destroyed the profession game. There is little to no reason to level or work on professions of any kind. the gear is good for leveling but, that is a very small percentage of the time a character is played. They added rng into profession to get people to keep trying to get the right stats but, why even bother. Now they are adding a new ilevel. Whoopie. No imagination beyond coming up with a level name.<br />
<br />
Raiding is the only thing that they want us to do. If you don't raid they don't care about your opinion. They ask why don't you raid and whatever answer you give the response is you should try raiding. They added a legendary quest chain this expansion as we all know. What is the bulk of this quest chain? Raiding of course. Not some tough task in a raid but, mindlessly repeating the same raids over and over again to get some randomly named quest item x 1000 or whatever. How is this engaging?<br />
<br />
They took out flying. Then what's his name developer let it slip that they weren't putting it back in. Oh my gods the backlash. Now they are giving it back to us in some undetermined patch in the future. But, not by just playing the game or paying for it. Now you have to get loremaster, explorer and do all the bonus quests. That is understandable but, you also have to grind reputation for three factions that aren't even in the game yet. This is going to take three weeks of running dailies every day. That is just plain evil. I guess MoP was too long ago for them to remember how many people HATE dailies.<br />
<br />
People asked for more small group content and they give us rehashed 5 mans. I don’t care how you change the difficulty it is still the same 5 man. Call it timewalking, mythic or super duper hard, it is still just the same 5 mans that we have already done.<br />
<br />
Garrison are the largest time sink in the game to date. They are the most rewarding part of the game as well. Is it any surprise that that is where people are spending the bulk of their time? I would be willing to bet money that if we had access to the metrics we would know that garrisons have more time spent in them than every other activity in wow put together. Let's face it people, garrisons are basically a giant facebook game. So, now they realise that people are using this and instead of making it more rewarding to go out into the world they nerf the gold production of the garrisons. Classic. So, now they add a second mission table. How in the world is that going to make garrisons or anything else better?<br />
<br />
So, in closing I want to say that the questing in WoD is pretty good but, everything else is ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read this morning on the WoW forums that they've changed the way caches work, and that you will only get caches from whatever raid level you've been running. Is that correct? I scanned through the changes here and may have overlooked it.<br />

As an LFR/AH/garrison cache hero, I've relied on getting normal caches for some upgrades but mainly to acquire transmog gear, so if I'm only getting LFR gear from caches in 6.2, I'll forego the missions altogether. I can gear up via Baleful items and empowerments, and call it good.</div></div><hr />
