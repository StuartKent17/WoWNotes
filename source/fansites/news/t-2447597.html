<br />
<br />
The fifth ring has two spec specific trait options to choose between for each spec for your class.<br />
The fourth ring continues to have one spec specific trait for each spec or the option of a general trait.<br />

Raid Testing Schedule - November 8th-12th<br />
On Thursday, November 8th and Friday, November 9th we will be conducting raid tests of the Mythic Battle of Dazar'alor. After Mythic testing has ended up Friday, we will open Normal bosses 1-6 for both faction. These bosses will remain available over the weekend.<br />
<br />
BOTH FACTIONS:<br />
Testing is open for both factions. However, for some bosses, raid members will temporarily re-live events as the opposite faction using a story flashback.<br />
<br />

<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a test environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br />
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br />
<br />
Q: What character should I use to test the raid?<br />
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players' effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested. <br />
<br />
Q: How long does testing last?<br />
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we're satisfied that we've received that information for a given boss, we'll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.</div></div><hr />

The fact you can buy a boost is a testament from Blizzard themselves that leveling is a non enjoyable, unpolished experience that's worth a significant amount of money to skip, so you can get to the part of the game they want you to be in. <br />
<br />
But hey maybe that's not all to it yet, but i've got the feeling it might be so. At least people who like endgame a lot will have a better time now. I'm probably just not the type of player that's being appealed to anymore. Wish they'd prove me wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually its less RNG, the fifth ring is bigger so its a choice between 6 traits, 2 for each spec. Which means higher chance to have the one you want. Also fifth and fourth ring can't have same traits so you have 3 chances per item to get a trait you want. Blizzard also re-balanced traits and added some new ones. Also each boss in the raid now drops an azerite item instead of only some.</div></div><hr />

It seems like they're just trying to rush us from 60-80 as quick as they can since they know that leveling chunk sucks. The amount of XP it takes to get to 80 on the PTR is what it would have taken to get to 68 on live, so you're spending less than half the time in that range.<br />
<br />
My question is about what happens to our current characters. If I have a character sitting half way to 83 (thus having 456,000ish XP), will I log in and they'll be 95? Or will I log in and the amount of XP they have be reduced to match their level?</div></div><hr />

Since the new added ring is first outer ring it will require same or less heart level to unlock as current outer ring. But I guess you are not able to give any fucks about thinking about something for 5 seconds before complaining needlessly. On par for this site's forums.</div></div><hr />

But it will still create additional effort to unlock all rings.<br />

You will be the same level, because it doesn't actually track your exp as a total that way. In the past when reductions like this happened they just capped you one exp away from leveling if you were over that amount, but now they have the way the reduce your heart exp to the same % as it was weekly so they might go that route instead.</div></div><hr />

I'd imagine you will still be level 82 and that the % needed for the next level remains unchanged. It's just the numerical values of XP that get changed.</div></div><hr />

the game is about character progression not about gearing. Gearing is a part of character progression so is leveling up.</div></div><hr />

Please. I'll take them either allowing us to unlock the armor even with characters that were boosted/RAF'd, or with other max level characters of a different race. Anything that doesn't involve drudging alt number 75 through the by now hilariously outdated pre-MoP leveling experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Other times they have done this you remain the level you already were but you're like, 1 experience point away from the next level. It might be like that this time.<br />

Edit: this was only if you were over halfway through the level I believe. If you were less than halfway you were back at freshly dinged.</div></div><hr />

The fact you can buy a boost is a testament from Blizzard themselves that leveling is a non enjoyable, unpolished experience that's worth a significant amount of money to skip, so you can get to the part of the game they want you to be in. <br />
<br />
But hey maybe that's not all to it yet, but i've got the feeling it might be so. At least people who like endgame a lot will have a better time now. I'm probably just not the type of player that's being appealed to anymore. Wish they'd prove me wrong.<br />
<br />
They made efforts to improve leveling by slowing down monster killing, etc.<br />
<br />
That had the consequence of making leveling much slower.<br />
<br />
They have decided that they want the leveling experience to take a similar amount of time as before, but make fighting mobs feel more dangerous.<br />
<br />
You don't improve the leveling experience by making it take longer to get to the meat of the game. You do it by making mobs feel dangerous and rewarding to kill, and then you reduce the amt of xp required to off set that side effect.</div></div><hr />

They only came back and put a frame over the 25% or so of the hole. Levelling still takes way too fucking long and I doubt reducing time from 120 hrs to 80 is going to make a lot more people want to spend 2 work weeks levelling an alt.<br />
<br />
All this really says is that boost sales have capped out and now players who used to stay subbed doing things like levelling alts are also dropping out.<br />
<br />
They overdid it with lvl scaling, removing power and gear progression and gutting alternative paths like RAF for the people who wanted to go fast.<br />
Level scaling was what was needed for people wanting to play through the story and who didn't care how long it took. For everyone else, it was a massive negative that needs even more reversion if they are going to continue to put more and more gimmicky allied races in the game.</div></div><hr />

It's extremely whiny first of all, always forcing the negative side of anything. <br />
<br />
The whininess is further exemplified by your example. A hole in -your- house, and then a picture frame over it, shows that you're both very entitled (it's Blizzard's house if anything, let's say they change a hall in a museum/theme park) and whiny (if they revert a change, it isn't &quot;hanging a picture frame over the hole&quot;, but repairing the hole/changing the hall back to what it was). I'm happy for the change, why should I be constantly looking for things to cry about?</div></div><hr />

The only thing that's bad for the game is increasing the gate to get to the actual game which blizzard is finally starting to realize far too late. There is a reason the forums were on fire post 7.3.5 and have been slowly quieting down since. People are quitting it isn't fun to do the same grind again but longer.

<br />
I've played through the cataclysm leveling revamp for the most part, and the quests themselves are well made. I think they are better than BFA quests. However, the overall experience of doing these quests i personally find lacking, because of game design decisions that rendered them to be mindless tasks that alongside lack of challenge, also lacked socialization opportunities that would naturally occur if met with any struggle or downtime during the questing. <br />
<br />
On top of this, sharding further reduced any motivation for me to bond with other players as i quest through the world, since they pop in and out whenever and wherever, add on top of that the lack of a struggle to overcome and potentially just spamming LFD (which again, is supporting a pretty anti social, hardly challenging leveling experience, and takes you out of the world instantly), and it all becomes nothing but what feels like a slow drag to endgame, where all the fun is supposed to start. <br />
<br />
It's great if you can't be bothered with any downtime or &quot;unnecessary&quot; socialization, and want high efficiency to get to endgame as fast as possible, maybe watch netflix on the side because the content is not engaging enough. But for me (and i realize i'm not the type of player WoW caters to currently) i would want engaging content, which to me comes with challenging enemies (player or npc), rewarding exploration, an intact community i can see out in the world and bond with over challenging content (which also means combat downtime to support that further), and regular gear/ability/talent and profession progress that visibly changes my character's power as i level up. <br />
Basically, what i want is the leveling not to feel like a grind, and instead embrace more of the RPG element of the game which has been neglected to add depth to the process. I think 120 levels at this point seems overwhelming with the current leveling design, but if i have a good time getting there (and once i get there aswell), it becomes nothing but a number i'll eventually get to as i play the game.<br />
<br />
Once it starts to feel like a grind, and i see the treadmill in front of me because i'm not engaged/have fun, i'll feel every single bit of experience i still lack to get to max level. To combat this I'd have to put on heirlooms to further increase my characters powers and xp gain, and summon a choiffeur to ride me from A to B as fast as possible starting from level 1 (if i even had one) to get to the end of this time gate as quickly as i can, understandably. Or i save myself the trouble and spend money to keep the suffering as short as possible. This additionally further reduces any attachment i have to my character, because they are very swiftly interchangable if i ever run into trouble (which is also important to go through in my opinion to have a worthwhile experience in the game), alongside being very unlikely to have any lasting reputation in the community due to the vast amount of players fleetingly coming together through sharding. <br />
<br />
Just as the endgame, it becomes about optimization and a tunnel vision to the goal/s set by that player, and a community which has a big focus on these values, which is good if you are that type of player, and Blizzard should also cater to this type. Which they did again with the decrease in XP needed, to ease the pain so you can get to the actual fun part Blizzard puts all their attention on quicker. I want a fun time wherever i'm at in the game, preferably making friends along the way, and they have the capability to create that type of content as well.. if they want to.</div></div><hr />

Ok. Questing today is not different from questing back them. It's the same fetch quests, kill X number of mobs quests, kill specific mob quests, and delivery quests. What changed is that the mini-map and world map now show where you need to go for said quests. But in the past we had addons like QuestHelper. There were group quests that required you to group up with others, but, in my experience, back then, people would rather skip them than do them. I had a tough time, for example, throughout TBC to find even a single player to help kill Durn the Hungerer, or worse, the Ring of Blood quests. After the first tier of raiding back in Wrath, I had to depend on my guildmates to help me finish the group quests in Icecrown.<br />

On top of this, sharding further reduced any motivation for me to bond with other players as i quest through the world, since they pop in and out whenever and wherever, add on top of that the lack of a struggle to overcome and potentially just spamming LFD (which again, is supporting a pretty anti social, hardly challenging leveling experience, and takes you out of the world instantly), and it all becomes nothing but what feels like a slow drag to endgame, where all the fun is supposed to start.<br />
I honestly don't understand the issue with sharding, especially since what you're describing &quot;people popping in and out whenever and wherever&quot; has only usually happened to me while I'm on the back of a gryphon during a taxi flight, and even then only to other people in a taxi flight around me. It only happens on the ground to me when I join or leave a cross-realm group.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's great if you can't be bothered with any downtime or &quot;unnecessary&quot; socialization, and want high efficiency to get to endgame as fast as possible, maybe watch netflix on the side because the content is not engaging enough. But for me (and i realize i'm not the type of player WoW caters to currently) i would want engaging content, which to me comes with challenging enemies (player or npc), rewarding exploration, an intact community i can see out in the world and bond with over challenging content (which also means combat downtime to support that further), and regular gear/ability/talent and profession progress that visibly changes my character's power as i level up.<br />
About the &quot;socialization&quot; part, that's a player problem, not a game problem, unfortunately. You can't blame Blizzard for players opting to use the tools that fit their desires better, instead of your desires. Yes, Blizzard created those tools, but isn't that what they are supposed to do, make the game more fun for their audience? Blizzard is not &quot;forcing&quot; anyone. Blizzard also created a &quot;communities&quot; feature, where you can join other communities to socialize.<br />
<br />
As for your power progression thing, I think it is kind of at odds at your desire to face &quot;challenging content&quot;. What challenge is there if, in two or three levels, you're stronger than anything else around you to the point that you could AFK to go prepare a sandwich, and when you return, you're still alive with over half your health while being ganged by a few mobs?<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, what i want is the leveling not to feel like a grind, and instead embrace more of the RPG element of the game which has been neglected to add depth to the process. I think 120 levels at this point seems overwhelming with the current leveling design, but if i have a good time getting there (and once i get there aswell), it becomes nothing but a number i'll eventually get to as i play the game.<br />
Blizzard has greatly reduced the leveling experience required to level up as the years went by. If I remember things correctly, you would take longer to reach level 60 or 70 back during vanilla or TBC, respectively, than you take to reach level 120 today. Also, what RPG elements, specifically, are you talking about? Because your character does gain power as they level up, they do gain more abilities, and its appearance does change as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once it starts to feel like a grind, and i see the treadmill in front of me because i'm not engaged/have fun, i'll feel every single bit of experience i still lack to get to max level. To combat this I'd have to put on heirlooms to further increase my characters powers and xp gain, and summon a choiffeur to ride me from A to B as fast as possible starting from level 1 (if i even had one) to get to the end of this time gate as quickly as i can, understandably. Or i save myself the trouble and spend money to keep the suffering as short as possible. This additionally further reduces any attachment i have to my character, because they are very swiftly interchangable if i ever run into trouble (which is also important to go through in my opinion to have a worthwhile experience in the game), alongside being very unlikely to have any lasting reputation in the community due to the vast amount of players fleetingly coming together through sharding.<br />
Going by the assumption you're a long-time player, I imagine you've gone through the leveling process at least a handful of times. I'm also assuming you're not the type who creates a new character to level with the express intention of leveling it. You'd level a new one for heritage armor, or a new main character, or a new alt to work as an alchemist/jewelcrafter/whatever profession to make you self-sufficient. In this case, no matter how &quot;engaging&quot; leveling it, it'll grow boring for you, eventually.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just as the endgame, it becomes about optimization and a tunnel vision to the goal/s set by that player, and a community which has a big focus on these values, which is good if you are that type of player, and Blizzard should also cater to this type. Which they did again with the decrease in XP needed, to ease the pain so you can get to the actual fun part Blizzard puts all their attention on quicker. I want a fun time wherever i'm at in the game, preferably making friends along the way, and they have the capability to create that type of content as well.. if they want to.<br />
No matter what is done to the leveling experience, there will always be people who will treat you the way you're describing. Always. There'll always be people looking for the fastest methods to level, or the easiest paths to go through. And I'm sorry, but no matter what Blizzard does to the leveling system, even if they do exactly what you're asking for, eventually you'll be right back where you are right now: complaining about how boring the leveling system is.</div></div><hr />

A talent every tier every 15 levels doesn't cut it especially when you have access to virtually all of your abilities by the time you're level 80. Getting a small something every level would mean A LOT to the feeling of character progression and Legion-style passive abilities would make specs feel less bland without bloating the action bars.<br />

There's a huge HUGE gap between what we have now and &quot;bloating the action bars&quot;, I'd argue they've never been bloated and right now it's just a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the purpose of speeding up leveling other than to rush players through already mismatched, now (in 2018) very low quality content.<br />
<br />
Put the level cap back at 60, then never raise it again. Bring back Path of the Titans for all the fun Artifact Weapon / Azerite / talent type traits. As expansions release you continue getting points for the Path of the Titans, maybe new paths unlock each expansion, who knows there's creative freedom there. Point is, character progression is so borked throughout the entire game, just speeding people up to max level is not a solution.<br />
<br />
The game is in tatters now, it's disjointed and we only allow it because we love World of Warcraft. I sure do, that's why I want this leveling nonsense to get a proper solution. But if I'm honest, I am enjoying much better games these days since I stopped raiding with patch 6.0. Since then I just log in to see the new content then wait for a catch-up patch later on. <br />

<br />
the xp leveling values come directly from the server as a string. Once they apply their update and you log-in you'll have the new values, so if you have 456k and needed the cap is going to move towards 346k which means you'll level up instantly to 84 and gain 110k within level 84.<br />

<br />
I've said it countless times, but I'll go at it again. I played all of vanilla, and leveled a few characters. My first character was more of a drag as back then the patch which added more quests wasn't implemented so it meant I did level by grinding here and there when quests weren't available, especially the late levels 55-60.<br />
<br />
I had the chance to also try vanilla on a private server in 2011. It was pure magic. Nostalgia - yes, but not only that, the game sort of had a purpose. Getting to 60 again was a drag and not as easy as e.g its was in legion, but it was definitely fun. Fun because I managed to level with 1 of my friends and we took our time. Running dungeons, pvping in STV etc, great.<br />
<br />
So I think your argument is kinda of invalid. I personally hate leveling, and I understand that you feel like its going to be a drag getting from 1-60 but in reality if you take the time to play and enjoy, also start at the release of classic, you are going to forget all about it as you are going to meet people during leveling as you did back in vanilla and you are going to form friendships that you cant do in teh current game.<br />
<br />
Also once you go e.g to searing gorge or other places that you enjoyed back then, I am pretty sure that nostalgia is going to overcome the grind. It did for me, and again I hate leveling.</div></div><hr />

I appreciate the time you took to respond to my message. I do get the impression however that you didn't read my post with the intention of trying to understand where i'm coming from as i propose these changes, and are rather just out to defend your stance, or perhaps rather Blizzards current stance if i dare say, on leveling. <br />
<br />
You continuously assume no matter what they did, I'd get bored, dismissing how i just wrote a detailed reply about just how important leveling is in the game to me. (that means i like it) You assume i blame blizzard for how leveling is currently (if you wanna call constructive criticism blame, feel free to do so, but that's not the type of discussion level i'll get dragged into), and how i shouldn't expect players to act the way i want (which again, assumes i want to change specific player types, even though i wrote in my post that there should be a place for these types as well, and they are part of the game just the same). Neat assumptions if you are out to discuss with the intent of a rhetoric battle.<br />
<br />
I'm not here to convince you of anything, i'm not interested in direct discussions. I replied to your post because you said you were curious, assuming you were genuine, and i gave you my perspective to clarify what a type of player like myself would need for leveling to be high quality in the hopes someone at Blizzard also sees it and is actually curious.<br />
I see you have a different vision of what leveling should be and that's cool. It should be good for you just the same. It's ultimately in Blizzards hands how exactly they approach issues with leveling as they see them. Suggestions as to how they can do that are out there and hopefully visible to them, and they'll choose what they think is best, and that is what matters to me.<br />
That said, I think it would be very helpful for the community and for Blizzard, to start putting out constructive criticism and start realizing that we're on the same team when giving out these criticisms to make the game the best it can be for all its types of players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't though and it hasn't for a long time. It's a themepark at this point. The RPG is basically gone blizzard even put in an in game system to direct you to where to go to finish quests. At this point they don't really add low level content just max stuff.<br />

Play a warrior with the spamstring kiting that people have perfected on private servers to actually cancel mob autos and it will actually be fairly fresh and certainly more challenging than current leveling.

I do get the impression however that you didn't read my post with the intention of trying to understand where i'm coming from as i propose these changes, and are rather just out to defend your stance, or perhaps rather Blizzards current stance if i dare say, on leveling. <br />
<br />
You continuously assume no matter what they did, I'd get bored, dismissing how i just wrote a detailed reply about just how important leveling is in the game to me. (that means i like it) You assume i blame blizzard for how leveling is currently (if you wanna call constructive criticism blame, feel free to do so, but that's not the type of discussion level i'll get dragged into), and how i shouldn't expect players to act the way i want (which again, assumes i want to change specific player types, even though i wrote in my post that there should be a place for these types as well, and they are part of the game just the same). Neat assumptions if you are out to discuss with the intent of a rhetoric battle.<br />
<br />
I'm not here to convince you of anything, i'm not interested in direct discussions. I replied to your post because you said you were curious, assuming you were genuine, and i gave you my perspective to clarify what a type of player like myself would need for leveling to be high quality in the hopes someone at Blizzard also sees it and is actually curious.<br />
I see you have a different vision of what leveling should be and that's cool. It should be good for you just the same. It's ultimately in Blizzards hands how exactly they approach issues with leveling as they see them. Suggestions as to how they can do that are out there and hopefully visible to them, and they'll choose what they think is best, and that is what matters to me.<br />
That said, I think it would be very helpful for the community and for Blizzard, to start putting out constructive criticism and start realizing that we're on the same team when giving out these criticisms to make the game the best it can be for all its types of players.<br />
I'm not saying you blame Blizzard, and I apologize if what I wrote gave that impression, but this isn't something Blizzard can fix. Socialization is entirely on the player's hands. And as for your post, I did read it. You point out some things you're unhappy with, but you don't really offer any way to improve the experience save for some vague &quot;make it more engaging&quot; statements, but no any actual way in how to do so, which was my original question.<br />
<br />
Little off-topic, but still kind of related, is the fact that it is actually impossible to please everyone. No matter what changes Blizzard does to the leveling, at least someone, somewhere, is going to be unhappy.<br />

Factually wrong. It's actually even less.<br />
Pre-7.3.5, for example, the XP required to reach level 60 was 171700 xp (https://www.wowhead.com/news=277680/leveling-changes-on-the-7-3-5-ptr-experience-heirlooms-mob-health-pools-flying), but with the new change, it'll go down to 147470 xp, according to the table in MMO-Champion's front page (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8151-8-1-PTR-Leveling-Experience-Reduced-Fifth-Azerite-Armor-Ring-Added-Raid-Testing).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Class Mage, Spec Fire, Talent Critical Mass, requires 20 points in fire and is required before you can pick Combustion. Not 1%, but an amazing 2% critical increase FOR FIRE spells only...<br />
<br />
Oh I hear you say but why would you go with a fire spec, to a raid? Everything is FIRE RESISTANT! ok shall I go arcane and do things once every 3 minutes (PoM + trinkets + Arcane Power + Pyro) or should I go FROST?<br />
<br />
The point is that class balance was really shitty in vanilla, you are seeing it with rose tinted glasses. Honestly, there were classes that had the raiding spec, the leveling spec, and the &quot;do not touch this you stupid masochist&quot; spec (survival hunters comes to mind)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't give a shit about how your &quot;mood&quot; and &quot;aesthetics&quot; are affected when grinding through content that is 10+ years old. Leveling is tedious. <br />
<br />
If some people want to dick around with it and make it take forever, they can remove gear and walk without a mount. Hell, they can TURN OFF XP until they're ready to move on to another zone or move on to another level bracket. <br />
<br />
If other people want to maximize how quickly it goes by, they can and should be able to do that, your &quot;immersion&quot; be damned.<br />
<br />
<br />
People who want to punish everyone else and subject them to their own personal vision of what the game should be need to fuck off like yesterday. That goes for the flying &quot;purists&quot; too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's an idea, why not let people play the game that they pay to play the way they want to play it? I know, it's a novel idea, and one you might not be used to. When you level a character how about you do it without heirlooms and you can enjoy it the way you want to and when I level characters I will use heirlooms and enjoy it the way I want to. Win win!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I earned them because I farmed all the money and tokens needed to obtain them. &quot;poor and unengaging gameplay&quot; you say? The only reason you despise heirlooms is because you don't use them or just don't have enough money to buy them, so you are just envious. Heirlooms negate the stupid need of changing your gear over and over and you can feel you have a really good gear that power ups with you.Without heirlooms, leveling alters would be a torture. So please, just shut up and &quot;enjoy&quot; your tedious boring leveling.</div></div><hr />

CM has 3 ranks, 2% per rank = 6% inc to crit chance to fire spells....that was god tier in vanilla.<br />
<br />
Hell fire mages now have a flat 15% crit added to them (or at least for awhile). Also if you think balance was bad in vanilla (this is coming from a ret paladin that raided in MC and AQ btw), play a shaman now in BfA. There hasn't been an expansion or time in WoW's history when there was a decent balance between classes. The only major difference between now and vanilla is there was only warrior tanks in vanilla and nothing else, except locks who could tank that one boss in AQ.<br />

The ignorance is strong with you. The sad thing is you only get 7 choices between talents now, classic had over 14 talents you can choose between depending if you went 40/20 or some hybrid build you can probably get 18 or 19 different talents depending on the ranks it had.</div></div><hr />

The EP for rogues is the worst argument you can bring to help your case mate...for proper EP use u plan your energy your finishers and try to get as much uptime as possible without doing shits like 2-3 cps usage or waste them in whatever moronic way u can think off, but with your standard 1% crit or 5% crit the way you put it u dont have to do anything , its just there passive boring hardly makeing you to plan or to react in any way</div></div><hr />

Exactly! Maybe wondering why the XP is the ~same at the end when its reduced so much at the beginning?<br />
<br />
Look no further than:<br />
LEVEL 110-111<br />
<br />
OLD = 831,450 - 717,000 = 114,450<br />
NEW = 831,000 - 537,730 = 293,270<br />
<br />
293,270 / 114,450 = 256% new vs old xp<br />

Maybe there is some added catchup continuum to account for the gap, but that's where the too good to be true is located - the % column is also misleading if comparing by level.</div></div><hr />

I did notice this. They decided to siphon XP from 20-110 and just shove all of that shareholder-important gametime into that one level. At least BfA has a whole bunch of quests that I usually didn't do because I was maxed by the time I got here, so now you get to do more of those. And I think it's better to just do it in one level and be done with it instead of having them split this 300k XP over the rest of the levels - 110-111 is probably the easiest range to level in.<br />
Also there will be those daily incursions that are going to function like Legion Invasions catchup-wise. It's probably going to get a little faster on the whole.<br />
<br />
And if not, people will quickly notice how long it takes to get that first level and start complaining loudly in the forums. Maybe they'll get around to changing that next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Kids these days<br />

old talents were useless trash lol the only reason we had more spells and abilities back then was because you had access to all specs abilities but while at the beginining you're like oh wow i have so much i can use once you learn you barely use any of that and use your main spells and abilities just like now lol. like im not using tank shit in fury and same with arms.....</div></div><hr />

I really loved to hack and slash through enemy hords as a Prot Paladin or just went nuts on Mage and so on... now it is mostly 1 by 1 by 1 ...sooooooo frustrating, tedious and daunting. The whole task of leveling has become a mess after the scaling. Classes are WAY WAY WAY too weak to be fun to play... because thats what i desire the most when PLAYING a game; fun, after a long day of work all i want is some fun - plain and simple. So i beg Blizzard, please make leveling fun again. I dont care if i need more exp but i do care about the fun... as long its fun it can take forever, totally fine.</div></div><hr />

As it turns out, the xp from incursions is abysmally bad. We did the incursion this morning and got maybe 20% of a level, if that.<br />
<br />
Compared to Legion invasions BfA incursions are just utter trash.<br />
