<br />
About the mages loosing a few stats because they got a tons of armor. I also posted an explanation here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=310.msg1397#msg1397), it should help you understanding why mages are getting nearly the same stats as their season 1 gear. <br />
The item team is looking over the mage set again to verify whether it came in under its stat budget. Any changes that would be made, however, wouldn’t be ready or implemented by the time the patch is released and the items are made available. We can’t of course guarantee that changes will be made, but if the set turns out to have fewer stat points than intended we’ll get it fixed as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
A small fix for people seeing overpriced gear.<br />
For those of you that are seeing inflated prices, can you delete the wowtest folder and re-install the PTR patch to see if the prices are corrected? <br />
<br />
And a &quot;confirmation&quot; of the release date, the June 19/20th.<br />
So far things look good. If there is a delay, we'll let people know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it is the 19th.<br />
In Europe the 20th.</div></div><hr />

Very true that the new mage set doesn't seem to be much of an improvement over set 1 - nevertheless, I bet we are told it is designed according to spec.<br />
<br />
I would prefer it if the sets were not restricted by class. Then any clothie could mix and match the items according to how they want to play it - reduced crit and more damage for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think the patch introduced new belt, bracers, and boots to match PvE teir 6 pieces (Hyjal &amp; BT).<br />
<br />
Unless you mean the new Honor epic belt, bracers, and boots? They do match the new Season 2 set.</div></div><hr />
