Flying mount in Northrend<br />
A lot of people asked if we can use the Flying mount in Northrend. The answer is simple : Yes, and no. The official answer taken from Xfire (http://www.xfire.com/blog/blizzcon2007/14820/) is : we will be able to use flying mounts in Northrend, but not until &quot;level 75 or 78&quot; as they want to &quot;keep us grounded and guide us on foot&quot; as we start exploring the new continent.<br />
<br />
And while we're answering the top questions, no, you don't loose the original character if you create a Death Knight, it's a new one.<br />
<br />
Xfire chat with Tigole<br />
I posted a few lines of the chat yesterday, I only took the most interesting parts, you can read the full version on Xfire (http://www.xfire.com/blog/blizzcon2007/14857/) :<br />
<br />
[Blizzard] Jeff Kaplan: Q: Will all heroes in warcraft 3 be added, and if so, what will you do with Liches or Dreadlords? and is all the current class imbalance in the game a setup for the Death Knight?<br />
[Blizzard] Jeff Kaplan: We want to see how the Death Knight works out before talking about new Hero Classes. The cool thing about hero classes is it opens a lot of doors to pay homage to our favorite War3 heroes<br />
<br />
[Xfire] BlizzCon 2007: arrantprac: Engineers have been thirsting for information about the profession review for a while now. Are there any bits of info you can share with us regarding upcoming engineering improvements?<br />
[Blizzard] Jeff Kaplan: They'll be able to craft a new flying machine... that much i can tell you<br />
<br />
[Xfire] BlizzCon 2007: tabby Mc. Killerson: QUESTION: Will Northrend have lots of enviroments, or be a giant Winterspring?<br />
[Blizzard] Jeff Kaplan: We are absolutely NOT going to make Northrend all snow and ice! Howling Fjord (playable here at BlizzCon) is a beautiful, green forest zone with high cliffs, Borean Tundra has an &quot;autumn&quot; feel to it, Grizzly Hills looks like a beauitful Redwood forest. We definitely won't bury in snow.<br />
<br />
[Xfire] BlizzCon 2007: Valken: Question: Will there be a closed beta for Wrath of the lich king, if yes will there be more then one way to get in. Like there was<br />
[Blizzard] Jeff Kaplan: There will definitely be a closed beta for Wrath of the Lich King, and like the Burning Crusade and our other betas there will be multiple ways to get into that beta<br />
<br />
[Xfire] BlizzCon 2007: 1. How the thing with flying mounts is actually going to be in Northrend ? I mean, it will be a bit weird to see cosmic and ethreal Nether Drakes and Eather Rays in quite &quot;normal&quot; Azeroth envoirnment. Is this going to stay as it is ?<br />
[Blizzard] Jeff Kaplan: We're still unclear on exactly how flying mounts will work in Northrend. There WILL be flying mounts in Northrend and you'll be able to fly on your mount. But not for the initial levels when you enter the expansion<br />
<br />
[Xfire] BlizzCon 2007: 2. As I'm quite lore fun, for me it seems crazy for making Dalaran the capital of the Northrend :o How it was possible that ruined Kirin Tor was able to rebuilt it and (omagad) even transport the whole CITY through the sea to the new continent. Why you choose Dalaran for the capital role and are we goin to see logical explanation about how the Dalaran was formed in Northrend ?<br />
[Blizzard] Jeff Kaplan: More will come out about that soon but basically the Blue Dragonflight has taken a turn for the worse and the Kirin Tor are concerned about it. What's about to ensue is a battle over magic and once Dalaran is rebuilt, it will be the staging grounds for that battle<br />
<br />
[Xfire] BlizzCon 2007: Archeus: with the addition of death knights, and the fact that they will start at a higher level then usual, i'm rather worried that everyone will have a level 80 deathknight quickly, reducing alot of the epic feel of the class.<br />
Are there any plans to deal with this, or is it intended for everyone to have a chance at playing the deathknight on a high level?<br />
[Blizzard] Jeff Kaplan: There's not a huge concern about seeing too many Death Knights. The appeal of any class is unique to the individual, for example, a lot of players like staying at range so they prefer mages, hunters, warlocks etc. Others enjoy going toe to toe so they play warriors and rogues, and leveling is not too hard in the game - so really people can already play whatever they want. They tend to stay drawn towards certain roles.<br />
<br />
[Xfire] BlizzCon 2007: SS2 Maximilian: How does actually Siege weapons are going to work? Will they be controled and moved by players or will they work by clicking on them? A little like in Guild Wars.<br />
[Blizzard] Jeff Kaplan: Siege weapons are still being developed but we definitely want them to be player controlled. We also want the siege weapons to have mobility so they can be positioned and aimed. Our hope too is to introduce very &quot;warcrafty&quot; siege to the game -- things like Meat Wagons, Ballistas etc.</div></div><hr />

But they may have just made it a 3.6 speed weapon cause its a 3.6 speed weapon in disguise. Add the haste and you come out 3.6 rounded off.<br />
<br />
I did theory craft on merciless gladiator, twinblade of the phoenix and jin'rokh.<br />
Twinblade of the pheonix still comes out ahead cause of its gem slots. But if you dont have twinblade or something better than twinblade then jin'rokh is actually an upgrade but not that huge.<br />
<br />
not sure how if slam takes the weapon speed before haste or after.</div></div><hr />

This is the biggest crock o shit i have ever heard.<br />
There is no reason for a level raise.<br />
This is too much, too soon-even if xmas 2008 is release.<br />
All of your work in outland (even your damn mount) is worthless.<br />
Everything Bc....all wiped out<br />
Progression is one thing, this is making as much money as possible before they release their next mmo.<br />
flame away, jsut my thoughts</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The best scenario on the release date is around 10-14 months later (we expect Voice communications, ZA, a new 25 man &quot;T7&quot; instance and &quot;who knows how much&quot; Pre-expansion patches )<br />
<br />
But even if the expansion was released today,a couple of weeks not having your flying mount ain't something game breaking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry would you like some cheese with your whine?<br />
<br />
Would you rather level 5000 reputations in Northrend? Have the entire game a gear check? And the flying mounts just won't work in the starting zones.. we're sorry you won't be able to dive bomb gank players until your level 72 T.T<br />
<br />
Quit your whining, its like Arena Seasons, PvE progression has to reset sometime and relevel the playing field..</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the AE and Frostbolt are TINY upgrades, the Fireblast is exactly the same as the level 70 one.. I mean this combined with the view they have of Mage PvE performance, makes me think they genuinly don't know anything about us.<br />
<br />
Hmm that's strange, my Fireblast tooltip ingame says it does the same damage as that tooltip ftrom Blizzcon, but Thottbot says it should be less.. Hmm, I pwn?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Okey, checking on Thottbot, that R15 Frostbolt has the same damage as R14 Frostbolt, but that isn't currently ingame, it is a small upgrade on the whole. AE Is the exact same as the rank we have ingame, and Fireblast is a small upgrade (but my tooltip ingame says 730 - 865, and I'm certain Blizzard tooltip doesn't update to include talents, or dos it? (for damage I mean, I know mana cost))</div></div><hr />

On Thottbot we have this rank aswell, at level 70: http://thottbot.com/s38697 Rank 14 which is 630 to 680 but this is not ingame.<br />

But hey gief cooler hero classes than death knight gief mountain king or demon hunter :-D<br />
<br />
<br />
Demon Hunter should be some sort of Outland based Q imho...<br />
<br />
Mountain King should be based around Muradin's Grave (he was buried at Northrend, right?)<br />
<br />
&quot;above&quot; the arcane explosion (rank 10?) has same dmg as currently released rank 8</div></div><hr />

it's better as a 4,0 as it gives some enchant/buffs (SoC etc.) more chances to proc.</div></div><hr />
