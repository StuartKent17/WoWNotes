WoW stabilizes over 10M subscribers, down 100k in Q4 2011<br />
Activision Blizzard latest earning call revealed that World of Warcraft lost 100,000 subscribers last quarter, following the loss of 800k subscribers announced last quarter and 300k loss from the quarter before that. The game lost 1.8M Subscribers over the year but the number seems to stabilize over 10M and it wouldn't be surprising to see it go back up with the release of Mists of Pandaria this year. <br />
<br />
World of Warcraft now has 10.2M active subscribers. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft lost 100,000 subscribers, down to 10.2 million. This was a total lost of 1.8 million for the year.<br />
Diablo III should launch in Q2<br />
More than one million Annual Passes have been sold in the West.<br />
Blizzard is happy with how the subscription numbers held up during the most competitive quarter ever.<br />
When asked about churn since the competitor's launch, &quot;December was a good month for us.&quot;<br />
There are ~50 million active Battle.net, Call of Duty multiplayer, Call of Duty Elite, and Skylanders WebWorld users.<br />

Why do people always have to label it &quot;bad players&quot; and leave it at that? Is it possible that they just didn't enjoy the content? Is it possible that they moved on to other games? What is it that makes them &quot;bad&quot; because they decided to quit?</div></div><hr />

Granted the Xmas season helped but LFR has been a massive success despite how controversial it has been amongst the raiders. Making heroics take 15 min again with fast queues for casuals and adding a super easy raiding mode has softened the blow for Blizzard. We can argue all day what WoW should be, but these numbers and this last year show that WotLK is really where this game should have gone toward to show growth, not go back to a ancient Everquest type model. All that bruhaha talk, all that &quot;lets make epics matter again&quot;, all that elitism during Cataclysm beta has been showned to appeal to a minor audience Its 2012, the days of telling people to &quot;raid or die&quot; is over, LFR was just what this game needed whether we like it or not, numbers do not lie.</div></div><hr />

even 8million is a very impressive number of subs, not as good as it once was, but far more than any other mmo i think.</div></div><hr />

Basically, MW3 set record profits for the company while WoW slumped lower. But the company as a whole is in fantastic shape and WoW continues with it's fat 'n healthy 10mil subscription base. The status quo continues. Carry on.</div></div><hr />

People are going to get tired of WoW between now and MoP, so there is NO WAY that the subscriber numbers will be stable in the coming months. Also I don't know why people think that losing 100k subscribers is a good thing. Key word: losing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dokilar</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is not the quarter i would really be worried about. in all actuality i wouldnt be worried period, if im playing a game, having fun and enjoying it, i dont care how many other people are playing it so long as that number doesnt affect my gaming. that being said the game got old for me over a year ago and ive moved on and am enjoying playing other games. however like i said, there are always going to be doomsday people screaming that the sky is falling and this is not the quarter i would be worried about. 1st quarter and 2nd quarter of this year will be the ones to watch for. id predict 1st quarter will see some more declines (unless mop is released) due to 4.3 being out for quite some time and people unsubbing to save some cash. however the 2nd quarter (dependent on mop release of course) will be the one to watch for to see if any subs are gained. again let me emphasize however that none of this should matter to normal people. if youre enjoying playing a game then things like this shouldnt and probably wont bother you. the game will most likely stay profitable with only a sub number of 500k so barring any major catastrophes the game is going to be around for awhile</div></div><hr />

Q1 of 2012 is the quarter to watch out for though. Massive losses will occur in my opinion. Mists of Pandaria will probably regain a million or so subscribers though.</div></div><hr />

I'm subbed to both. People seem to believe that MMOs cannot coexist. It's not true. I admit, I wouldn't be subbed to WoW if it weren't for my guild, and I'm sure many other people feel the same. But it's all the same to Blizzard isn't it?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Awe</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldnt be so sure about it stabilizing. Rememeber that those data are from end of 2011. Annual pass kicks in, 4.3 with last raid from current expansion, christmas time. Also not enough time for all people who decided to switch to SWTOR and their WoW subs to run out (SWTOR started mid-december). Not that I think SWTOR can threaten WoW, it came out to be rather dissapointing, but it is still some marginal factor. <br />
<br />
From my own personal experience I can tell that many people are quitting right now and this trend will likely continue intil MoP. My guild died in January, a friendly big guild of mine also reduced their activity by quite a lot in recent weeks. People are bored with DS which is rather dissapointing raid tbh. <br />
<br />
So be prepared for big subs hit in 1st quarter of 2012.The biggest question right now is how MoP will be able to lure people back in. There is lots of hate towards Pandas but it is still a new expansion after all.<br />
<br />
PS. And yes - Diablo III inc.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I mean this only my own anecdotal experience, but my guild's raid team was cut in half with SWTOR and activity is way down. I really doubt they're going to be back before MoP.</div></div><hr />

I think this is a great improvement upon their Cata philosophy.<br />

Um what are you talking about man? Blizz has been actively losing subs this entire expansion now that they cater to the casual playerbase more than ever.

and why is nobody counting sw:tor as a &quot;hardship&quot; in staying hihg on the sub-count? only losing 100k subs while a hugely hyped game like sw:tor released in the meantime is very huge and im expecting a rise in the next quartals conference call!</div></div><hr />

Yeah, someone enjoys a game that you don't like anymore. He must be so dumb. I remember seeing that kind of attitude in kindergarten, no wonder you don't like WoW, it's rated 12+ after all. No worries, you'll understand that people have different opinions when you grow up.</div></div><hr />

yea it seems that a lot of people are either mis-informed or just unsure of how quarters work. this is not the quarter i would be mindful about and i had predicted to myself that this quarter would most likely be either a gain or loss of less than 200k.<br />

Q4 which included holiday sales and the last major content release of an expansion is enough to temporarily stop the bleeding... but it is still occurring and 100k is nothing to scoff at. If you see another quarter or 2 like this then maybe start throwing around terms like stabilized, but anyone who is an analyst worth there salt wouldn't come to that conclusion off of 1 quarter of minor losses. Q1 and Q2 of this year will probably be bad for blizzard. From personal experience most of my friends that weren't locked into year passes have been unsubbing. My guess is you'll see 500k + or more for the next 2 quarters. When Diablo comes out that is not going to help at all. That will most likely pull from the WoW player base and result in another spike in sub losses. Swtors recent numbers are not good. 1.7 million subs and they continue content releases at a quick clip. Guild Wars 2 will also debut this year and that will force a major hit in subs with the lack of a sub fee to play. Things have certainly not stabilized and this year looks to be a bad one for the WoW franchise. The best possible hope for blizzard, is a smooth quick beta with an early fall release with a major content patch at Christmas, or you are looking at another year of solid losses in wow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry, but why are people dumb for buying a year long subscription to a game they enjoy?<br />
If I had recently joined WoW, and I was enjoying my time on it. I would of thought getting a year subscription and a free game, plus mounts and beta access would be a nice addtion to a normal monthly fee was fine. There is nothing dumb about that choice. <br />
<br />
Considering I played WoW for around 7 years on and off now (quit for good a while back), I have spent more than a years sub in the game and got no free bonus' ontop. <br />
<br />
So your view of it being a &quot;trick&quot; is stupid, because it's a decent investment to people who actually like the game still. <br />
<br />
<br />

Oh, he said in another thread he is coming back to WoW for MoP to give it one last try. Thought I'd check on his other posts to see if he was a troll or just had a childish attitude...<br />

<br />
Anyways, it's good to know WoW hasn't taken that massive hit last quater. Since so many people were throwing out wild numbers. I was thinking it to be in the 500k area.</div></div><hr />

The subs arent &quot;stabilizing&quot;. And stop picking a timeframe of one month in comparison to an entire expansion. Ill repeat what i said once again because i can see youre just trying to argue for the sake of arguing. During Burning Crusade when their philosophy wasnt catered towards the casual playerbase their subscriptions started soaring and continued to do so during Cata. They have done NOTHING but bleed subs this ENTIRE expansion. Losing 100k subs isnt &quot;stabilizing&quot;. Once again, this ENTIRE expansion theyve done nothing but lose people. Did i say it enough times? Now gtf outta here and take your boat back to denial land.</div></div><hr />

I am a hater. NOT. I still think WoW is best MMO ever made. But facts are facts. SWTOR (which is rather bad in the long run IMO, I already unsubbed) has nothing to do with it. WOW is on unprecedent subs decline. It never happened before on such scale. I want WoW to be successful, as much as any other MMO as if it matters. More good games = more quality time. But I am going to eat my own foot if WoW will not get a big subs hit in Q1 and Q2 2012. I can see this happening right now. Lots of people I know quited recently. Including people who played this game since 2005. It is not that I WANT this to happen. I just observe what is going in. And if Blizzard will not do something big, WoW will loose a lot of subs until MoP. And then after MoP we will see what happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow reports people who were subscribed in the past 30 days of the end of the quarter. Swtor opened on the 20th of December (13th for early access) so you could quit on the 4th of December and it would still count you as subbed. The next quarter will be more revealing.<br />
<br />
The Annual pass, LFR and Dragon Soul should have resulted in a sub increase, but its still a decrease which is a surprise. The next quarter will be a sharper drop.</div></div><hr />

These numbers would include anyone who has an account active at any point during Q1. This is the same thing TOR does with &quot;active subscriptions&quot;. Nobody really says how the numbers are compiled, TOR counted all the free 30 day trials as active subscriptions because the credit cards are on file for renewal on Dec 31, 2011. You don't really get a good grip of the actual numbers for a quarter or so later than what you'd expect for these reasons.</div></div><hr />

There are a handful of people on these forums that are actually looking at the numbers from a logical view. If you have 4 straight quarters of losess, 3 being major the last being minor. It is more reckless for Boub to come to the conclusion that things have stabilized off of one quarter of not-as-bad-as-the-last-3 numbers than it is to assume things are going to continue to get worse in a year with NO CONTENT PLANNED, and mop not even in beta. So stop with the name calling. Myself I have the year pass. Why? Beta access will determine for me if MoP is going to be worth another giant money sink + sub fees. That and I get Diablo 3. Otherwise while I have some friends that will probably always play, server pops have fallen off hard since 4.3. I would put my money on most of the haters at this point for another bad year than I would on stabilization. Though I'm sure we will all be having this convo again next Q call.</div></div><hr />

Don't accuse Blizz of spinning something and then spin it hard in the opposite direction, that's just being a hypocrite. :P Stabilize is a good word for it; if the subscriptions fell by 100k and then just stopped falling and held steady there, and they have indication to believe that they will remain steady there, then 'stabilize' is the correct word. After all, the use of the word tells investors something important: that 'this is the number we expect to keep.'</div></div><hr />

lol how was it a trick? You make it sound like people forced themselves to play wow to just get D3 for free which for some might be the case but others I doubt it. Also with them delaying D3 they screw themselves because by the time it comes out I'll have half a year into the annual sub. They were probably hoping doing the annual sub and then releasing D3 a month or 2 after would lessen the load on servers and would save them money, which now won't be as much of a case since people will only have about 6 months of paying instead of 8-10.</div></div><hr />

What kind of wonky math did you use to come up with a 400million dive in profits? (15*12)*100000 = 18,000,000, for a year, or more accurately 6,000,000 for the quarter.

I am very sad to see the game going this way and money-milking techniques striving like the Auction House requiring money. as for SWTOR, anouncing +1.7million gains is not bad at all, considering that people are now subscribing since 'friends' suggesting it to other friends etc. Blizzard has to really drop the pandaria 'appeal to chinese market' tricks and focus on a quality game or the fall is gonna be harder and faster than the Everquest fall back 10 years ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It shouldn't, because a loss in the biggest quarter of the year when large customer subscriptions are expected is a bad thing. When you take into account that Q4 is a holiday quarter which boosts the sales of quality games, that they had the annual pass, and that 4.3 was released, only to see losses, you know something is wrong. Yes, the fan boys can come out and defend it saying, &quot;That's not a big loss at all,&quot; but they don't know what they're talking about. Likewise, the doomsayers that will quickly jump on the &quot;The game is dying&quot; bandwagon aren't necessarily right either.<br />
<br />
From a business prospective, and a stock holder myself, I can tell you that this is a bad sign. Essentially, Blizzard can no longer be trusted to make a quality game that's going to keep stock prices high or sustain them. A year long period of losses means something isn't right, and as a stock holder, you should dump the stock before the value drops.<br />
<br />
So to sum it up; A loss isn't necessarily the sign of the end, but it isn't something to be looked at positively either. It's not the &quot;end of WoW&quot; but for stock holders, it may be the end of those stocks.</div></div><hr />

This is true. I wonder how many are paying for the Annual Pass but not playing at all. I also wonder at what point they will finally put a fork in the Cataclysm (appropriate name for the effect on subscriptions) and go back to the after action review of Wrath. Perhaps instead of rolly polly pandas, player models would be in line, and maybe just maybe we liked the old system.

Anecdotal evidence is just that.<br />
<br />
even more so since anecdotal evidence can, and usually is skewed , or completely made up to favor one's position on a subject. for instance 7 people you know have quit playing SWToR does not mean that a lot of people have quit playing also. 19 out of 20 of my closest friends do not like assosiation football. however i could only come to the conclusion that a majority of the people in the world do not like assosiation football if i was a deluded idiot.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bahska</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 10:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The q4 reports aren't an actual indication of current WoW subscriptions, nor will they reflect the bulk of the people who've left WoW for SWTOR.<br />
<br />
Remember q4 reports close on Dec 31st. SWTOR came out on Dec 20th, and a lot of people who left for SWTOR had an active subscription in WoW till let's say Jan 5th for example. These people are still counted on their reports as an active subscription.<br />
<br />
By the same note, SWTOR's 1.7 million &quot;active subscriptions&quot; is also not a true indicator.<br />
<br />
The Q1 reports will be a better indicator.<br />
<br />
And Patch 4.3 didn't come out till December this earnings call is for 3 months not just December, it will be interesting to see Q1 2012.<br />
Only losing 100k subs when most of that quarter was &quot;Old Content&quot; (Firelands) isn't bad at all however.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aureth</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was about what I expected, actually. I didn't think they'd gain, but I actually have been guessing the losses the past couple of quarters rather accurately. I figured 4.3 would have helped soften some of the blow, but yeah-nice to see it's stable, but 100k is still a loss. Compared to the 10.2 million they have, it's ''small'', but it's still 100k subs that dropped.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree, though, that the next round will be the trying one. Besides the fact we'll get the 'who left for ToR' numbers(which, while aren't enormous, I imagine are some) DS at that point would have been around awhile without much new stuff. If we don't start getting some solid MoP information soon, I think that might further frustrate people. I know they have a thing ''Soon(tm)'', ''When it's ready(tm)'' and so on, but I do hope they're ''Ready'' to drop some information soon, at least to possibly reassure people who are still skeptical about how long Dragon Soul is going to last. (I'm being optimistic and saying this time they truly will try to push this out before people begin to drop off in serious numbers. Even though they have a ton of subs still, I don't think they can afford to keep MoP on ice until September or something. When I say ''can't afford'', I mean more in the lines that I DO think at that point they'd see some serious and hefty dropoffs.) <br />
<br />
<br />
Time will tell. They're stable now, but they can't rest on their laurels and take too long with this next expansion, IMO.</div></div><hr />

when i refer to a game being dead is when i log onto my server which is supposibly high pop at peak times and you hardly see anyone in the cities or in the raid instances and almost all the top guilds have stopped playing cuz they see no point in doing the raids since hell they already did it on normal and with the LFR and see no point in waisting their time standing around. i feel most ppl are just staying subbed with annual pass/reg sub till MoP</div></div><hr />

Should I instead subscribe for the next year and get nothing out it, while I wait for my MoP beta invite I never get, then pay $60 for D3?<br />

You may have seen the server wide PvE event chains that whole server can work towards ... then there are dungs, pvp tournaments, server vs server vs server pvp, bazilion achievs to farm. And honestly the pvp grind in WoW for example is grind only because the PvP is boring ... I play LoL daily, just for the fun of playing ... it's not grind if it is fun.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rexxigg</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think all the Annual Pass did was give free crap to people who were going to continue paying the monthly fee anyway. If you signed up for the annual pass just for a free Diablo 3, you're an idiot. By this time you could have been putting that 14.99 a month in a cookie jar and have enough to buy Diablo 3 when it was released AND not be locked into a game you only paid for to get another game for free. That logic doesn't make sense to me.<br />

If you know you are going to play WoW for a year you will be saving $60 I don't understand how that is not logical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bought into the annual pass and honestly I'm regretting it. Dragon Soul is...not worth clearing for a year, and while the beta and Diablo 3 are definitely decent perks, in retrospect I would have rather taken my chance with the beta and just bought Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
The annual pass was a way to pad their subscription base for the lull period that's happened with every expansion, and it seems to have worked.<br />
<br />
The only thing I will say, is that the server populations don't seem to fit the subscriber numbers. Many servers have kind of died out, LFR queues are getting kind of long, and more and more raiding guilds are on hiatus.<br />

So while yeah, the 10 million number is certainly nothing to shake a stick at, it's difficulty for me to recommend people return to the game in its current state, considering the status of so many servers</div></div><hr />

It seems to have incomplete data, though, so I'm exactly sure how accurate the numbers themselves are on there. http://users.telenet.be/mmodata/Charts/WoW.png<br />
<br />
Subs actually did go up through part of Wotlk before they started a decline according to the graph, which differentiates it from Cata where the sub decline started happening early on (though Blizzard, at least, believes a large part of that was the difficulty of Cata at the beginning being higher than the difficulty of Wotlk, which is why we'll go back to a more casual-friendly launch on MoP it seems).</div></div><hr />

You make it sound like people forced themselves to play wow to just get D3 for free which for some might be the case but others I doubt it. Also with them delaying D3 they screw themselves because by the time it comes out I'll have half a year into the annual sub. They were probably hoping doing the annual sub and then releasing D3 a month or 2 after would lessen the load on servers and would save them money, which now won't be as much of a case since people will only have about 6 months of paying instead of 8-10.<br />
<br />
Blizzard enticed players with a &quot;Tyraels Charger&quot; WoW mount, FREE Diablo 3 (Which is bullshit, you've already paid for it in full 2x with the Annual Pass) and Guaranteed MoP Beta Invite, 2 of which cost Blizzard absolutely NOTHING to give players (In-Game Mount and an Email) only as a ploy to bloat the Subs for the Q4 data. Now, in order to keep the Mount, Invite, (Free?) Diablo 3 you need to keep yourself locked into the Annual-Fees which only proves to feed the Subs #. If you were to cancel it at any time before a payment installment is made, you lose everything. <br />

By taking advantage of this special promotion, you are committing to a 12-month World of Warcraft subscription, and you cannot cancel your subscription until the 12-month term of the agreement has ended.<br />
For additional questions, please review the legal document. (http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/world-of-warcraft-annual-pass-faq#q-15)<br />

They're not fun to play for me, so I will be returning for MoP like day one. <br />

But for now, I'd just gotten into PvP and watching Warriors there is just a huge downer. For -me-, I don't care about why you think I'm wrong yadda yadda.

I was talking about the mythical people everyone keep talking about that signed up for the Annual Pass because of getting Diablo 3 for free. I was saying that if that's why you signed up, you're a moron. Keep your monthly fee in a cookie jar, buy D3 when it comes out, and don't stay locked into a game you say you hate.

I mean yeah ok, they lost about 1 tenth (1 out of 10 or 1/10) of their subscribers but hey!!! No one made mention of how the game sold in China! As far as I remember their subscribers base increased during Lich King (in Us and Eu) and that's the expansion the Chinese got during 2011! Only in a more polished version than ours I guess... Anyway. The press and the fanbase is having much faith on Guild Wars 2 which will use the free to play model (bye bye, 13 eu/month), and TERA which has an amazing set of graphics and based on previews it seems to offer at least the same experience other MMO deliver and last but not least The Secret World has come to be a much anticipated game due to its originality in the theme (it strays from the paths of medieval or space era of the average MMO).<br />

Yes, Diablo 3 is free if you fully intended to play WoW for the next year before ever even knowing the Annual Pass existed. As I've noted, if you signed up for an Annual Pass ONLY for free Diablo 3, you fail at personal economics.</div></div><hr />

Maybe, but then SWTOR will be the big loser as they go play D3 instead. Pretty sure that from that 1M subscribers, then the bigger part will for sure play WoW or D3...if I'm wrong, then remind me of taking my own life...because I bet my life it will be like that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wattsbo</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 11:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of the arguments used in this thread have been pretty hilarious tbh... &quot;Subs were going up for years, clearly the changes in Wrath/Cata have caused the drop&quot;...Have you considered that the game has been around for SEVEN YEARS, and it could just be that more people have &quot;finished&quot; with the game for whatever reason? Whether it be changes in real life situation, feeling like they've &quot;done everything&quot; and everything new is just the same old with new skins, or whatever. How many people play any other game for over 2 years? 3 years? 4 years? The list of games with that sort of longevity is pretty short. So the longer the game goes, the more &quot;old&quot; people stop. Unless you've got equal numbers of &quot;new&quot; people joining on, subs will decline. And since WoW isn't the &quot;new shiny&quot; that it once was, it's less attractive to new players - especially with all the anecdotal media-covered stories of how it destroys lives etc. &quot;BC was the best time ever, people raved about the raids etc, now they say how much they suck&quot;...How about back in BC times, raids were, in a lot of ways, relatively new. I mean, high-end raids back in Vanilla were 40-man affairs, and there were only so many guilds that could actually GET that many people together at once, let alone a capable group. BC with it's reduced raid sizes, made the raids a lot more accessible. More people were able to see them, and because they hadn't necessarily seen anything of the scale of raiding before, minds were blown. Also, Blizz learnt a lot from Vanilla raids, so of course BC were going to be better. But as time goes on, there's only so many things that can be done that are &quot;new&quot;, so again, people who've been playing for a length of time, start to see where things are re-hashes - &quot;This is just like x fight, but with green fire, and lasers&quot;...I don't think ANYTHING they release could possibly re-ignite the fire in these people, unless it was a completely new way to play the game (that's not gimmicky like the upcoming Pokemonz)... Me personally: Don't care how much the numbers drop, because I'm still playing and enjoying myself. But it's nice to see that (hopefully) WoW hasn't reached that point where a critical mass of people are leaving/have left, that results in the rest leaving. I don't think we're at that point yet. I've been playing since a month after release, but never &quot;serious business&quot;. Always mucking around levelling alts, pvp, dungeons, etc. Wrath was when I first started doing dungeons (LFD), because I couldn't commit to times for guilds, and never knew if I was &quot;good enough&quot;. Cata was when I first did a raid (LFR), for the same reason - by this time, everyone expects that you have raid experience, and if not, good luck getting into raids (not that I could commit to 4 hours/night, 3 nights a week like it was back in the Vanilla days). I'm still interested in the game, because I didn't burn out on doing all the content, every which way, in the beginning - so I'm still experiencing new ways to play the game. Heck, two nights ago was the first time I've ever seen Onyxia, when me and a mate went in there to see what kinda old content we can clear between the two of us. However, I know far more people who have quit, than who are still playing - most of them being people who started in Vanilla/BC, and have just grown tired of the game. For me, with young kids that necessitate being home at night while they're sleeping, I find WoW far more entertaining than TV, so I keep playing. But there's not many people like me left (hence the dropping sub numbers). Don't know why people have to fight over the state of the game based on sub numbers, when really, the game is still great, it's just that more people are &quot;done with it&quot; than excited to start it. Was always going to happen at some point! I just hope it holds out a while longer, until there's something else that can be a reliable, interest-holding time-sink...</div></div><hr />

Players were promised &quot;the Most Epic Raid, we've EVER done!&quot; Players bought into the hype and bought the Annual Pass. When in fact what we got was even more recycled content riddled with bugs and glitches (See Paragon, Ret Paladins, Vial of 1shot etc...) Everyone I know feels like they were lied to and feel cheated now that they got the Annual Pass. <br />
<br />
They still LOST 100,000 Subs during the release of Final-Tiered 4.3 Patch ON TOP OF the Sub-bloat of the Annual Pass when it was supposed to curb the SubLoss all together. 100,000 subs might not seem as much when you look at it in terms of 10,0000,000 still active players but if you picture it geographically...that's like 5% of the entire City of Chicago getting up and leaving on top of the already 1,7000,000 people that have left. Chicago is now nearly a Barren Wasteland with only 1/5th it's former population within a year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is why I am following these reports with interest and hope they keep dropping like flies in the upcoming year. I want wow to be good again, but for that to happen, they need to get a serious wakeup call that the course the game has taken is not the right one. I am personally hoping that the losses of Q1 will make them get their act together and realize that doing wow the activision way will only get people fired, so we can get back to having a good mmo.<br />
<br />
Also, for the swtor haters; swtor has been out 1¬Ω month, it got 1.7 mio subs, which means it has grown faster than wow ever did, and 1.7 million subs is still HUGE for an mmo. Sure, a lot of that is initial influx and it will likely stabilize and find it's growth rythm in the upcoming months, but at least TRY to understand the numbers you are dealing with and how to put them into perspective.</div></div><hr />

Paranoid sycophants like yourself are the exact reason I love reading these obvious troll bait posts. Well done, good sir.

I also love how anyone who says anything about WoW is infracted, but people can say crap about TOR all the time and nothing happens.

<br />
<br />
i dont know why people hate the idea of 2 mmos being sucessful at the same time. wow wont die any time soon, even with half od its current subs it would have an impressive amount of subs and more than any others on the market. seriously 7years and having more than 10million subs is amazing. but people should stop comparing it to SWTOR, that game is 2months old and people are already comparing the sub numbers.<br />
<br />
Its because some people are just very depraved, and are honestly either dedicated to their game of choice like a sports team, or scared to be apart of a game that has a chance of failing. Either way, it is unhealthy for both the person and the market.<br />
<br />
WoW is a good game, SWTOR is a good game, and as is Rift. The only games that were ever flops, were Conan and Warhammer. Hell, if the servers are still going, Final Fantasy XI was a fantastic game too. You don't need a business major to realize that a successful market, that is not stale off a singular MMO, is a healthy market.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Short story here.Thy did not give you a date to when thy will let you into the beta (sadface) thy will pick any date thy feel suited to let annual pass user enter it might be at the start of the beta consider your self very lucky then or it might be at the end.<br />
<br />
To fanboy of blizzard its still a 100K loss don't try to cover that loss by saying its not manny it is still a loss in a month where blizzard try's to stabilize it.Q123 of this year will be very interesting to give a close look at.The statement that it is stabilizing is inaccurate till you see Q1 andQ2 of this year.Im not a wow hater bud i have the feeling that were still looking at a sub loss overtime. The game is 7 years old pretty nice to have a 10.2 mil sub base after 7 years this game has had it pride it will not die bud it will keep loosing sub Q after Q till thy hit with something new.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really tired of seeing this.<br />
<br />
The annual pass IS NOT a legal contract, is NOT binding and you are NOT required to continue to pay for it.<br />
The annual pass IS possible to opt out of.<br />
<br />
Call blizzard, write a ticket and ask all you have to do to opt out of it is STOP PAYING. The only penalty for not paying is?<br />
<br />
Losing your mount<br />
Losing your free D3<br />
Losing your MoP beta invite.<br />
<br />
That's it. That's all there is too it.</div></div><hr />

Personally I am rooting for Blizzard to get knocked down a few pegs. They once had a great game. Maybe it was laziness setting in, or greed, but they slowed the output of new content. They have been dumbing down the game, homogenizing classes, and recycling old content. This is all just my opinion, of course, but I believe more and more people are coming to the same conclusion over time.</div></div><hr />

I really do NOT want to sound like a doomsayer or a dick here, but no matter what the WoW sheep (yes, sheep. I mean the people who are so devoted, they will tear down anyone else not in love with WoW) say, two million subs lost over a year is not good whatsoever. They need to stop puffing this up as &quot;WELL, IT IS ONLY TWO MILLION&quot; and realize that two million is huge compared to the subs WoW GAINED through Wrath of the Lich King, Burning Crusade, and such. <br />
<br />
Does no one remember how Activision-Blizzard made commercials about their millions sold? They gained subs then, they hemorrhaged them now. Again, not doomsaying here, but realistically speaking, that is not good.<br />

Those sub numbers are outrageously inflated by the asian market. Now the only people playing wow are people new to MMOs or people that begrudgingly play because they have so much time put into their characters that they feel trapped. Sorry, but the truth hurts and no matter how much you want to avoid it...eventually you'll come to your senses and realize that there are much better things to play out there.<br />
<br />
What ARE you talking about? <br />
<br />
Do you have any proof of that? I know several people that have left after playing since vanilla and BC. Time =/= commitment. If it did people would cheat on their wives of 20+ years.<br />
<br />
Are you saying that the Asian players are not people? Since you say its &quot;outrageously inflated&quot; by them but that insinuates that they somehow don't caount.<br />
<br />
There is not truth to hurt just you making up crap, come back with some actual proof and we'll talk but as of right now you look like that average wow-quitter who has to act bitter to justify his leaving.</div></div><hr />

Spyro the dragon online....okey dokey. Rest is no surprise. Blizz still hemorrhaging subs but the annual pass slowed the bleeding. Further delay on a Diablo 3 release opens up the possibility that people will not keep their agreements (there is no bad side, you'll just have to buy Diablo if you want it) and Blizzard is walking a thin line until they get something released. Activision is outperforming Blizzard and slow production and delays make investors nervous. Interesting that the Blizzard DOTA will be a f2p model instead of free. Experimentation for the future of WoW.</div></div><hr />

I want wow to be good again, but for that to happen, they need to get a serious wakeup call that the course the game has taken is not the right one. I am personally hoping that the losses of Q1 will make them get their act together and realize that doing wow the activision way will only get people fired, so we can get back to having a good mmo.<br />
<br />
Also, for the swtor haters; swtor has been out 1¬Ω month, it got 1.7 mio subs, which means it has grown faster than wow ever did, and 1.7 million subs is still HUGE for an mmo. Sure, a lot of that is initial influx and it will likely stabilize and find it's growth rythm in the upcoming months, but at least TRY to understand the numbers you are dealing with and how to put them into perspective.<br />
<br />
Its not about having to receive a wake-up call or a requirement of an impending wake-up call per se...<br />

From this a person that has some knowledge on how IR and business-life works, realizes that, these guys have problems in the development due to probably lacking capable employees to handle it, hence, the strict criteria. However, you can't be just accept every drooling developer-wannabe gamer, who has never properly finished a project that fit industry standards(software, hardware or reporting alike) as an employee just to high probably have them set you back in your goals.<br />
<br />
Now, regarding the &quot;Activision-WoW&quot; myth, it is an urban legend, and the supposed way they are handling the game in parallel with that concept, had actually made the game triumph. Why?<br />
<br />
Vanilla: Terrible content accessibility<br />
TBC: Karazhan, heroics and Arenas brought in more subs<br />
WotLK: 10m mode inclusion and easier content brought in subs, until Ulduar the might Guild Breaker hit, and apparently, people being ashamed at how hard they had failed it after the breeze the Naxx 2.0 was, had chanelled the pain of their broken pride to fling crap at anything released afterwards.<br />
WotLK, 3.2 and further: Subs increased further<br />
Cata: Entry content pre-4.1 had the exact effect of 3.1, and lead to further sub-losses. FL with its initial form negated the gain of 4.1,<br />
Cata, 4.3 and further: With annual pass and LFR, things are getting back to normal<br /> 
<br />
I may not be happy with the current form of gameplay and have my suggestions, with properly presented technicality for improvement in game-play, however, I'm not blind to interpret that the data of losses account for the delusioned idea of simplified game-play leading to it.<br />
<br />
Hence, lose your illusion, the game may not be in a good situation and present indications of going in a bad way, however, it isn't for the reasons you seem to kid yourselves with.</div></div><hr />

Not sure you can say that. I'm playing SWTOR. I still have 2 active WoW accounts. I disabled my third one. I am likely to discontinue a second. I'll keep at least one live due to the annual commitment deal and get my free Diablo III. I suspect a fair number playing SWTOR are keeping their WoW account active for now. But that could turn if they decide to play long term and cut down to one active game. Watch the numbers in 6 months and again about a year from now. Those will tell the long term story.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, most people rationale will realise the game is in a downward spiral. It's a slow one though. If you look at the charts for subs and how they point to the earth, most investors would run. I think there is major mitigation at work there with the figures. Kick up the ass Blizzard? Show us what you have. If you are not having a gun pointed at your heads that is. And who knows..</div></div><hr />

Investors wouldn't escape while the game has 10,2M subs, however, they high probably would if it were around 7~8M next year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.gamespot.com/news/diablo-iii-delayed-again-6350086<br />
<br />
&quot;Activision pushes action RPG to April-June quarter; company not expecting to ship both Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm and WOW: Mists of Pandaria this year.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Additionally, Activision today said it is expecting only one other title from Blizzard this year. The company has a number of announced projects, including Starcraft II: Heart of the Swarm and World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria.&quot;<br />
<br />
Deathwing is gonna be real stale by the time 2013 rolls around...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">javen</div><div class="date">2012-02-10, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remind me again why we even care how many subscribers there are? O_o That was the least of our concerns a year ago.<br />
<br />
I know, right? Based on responses like &quot;Suck it TOR&quot; it seems like people use it as a definitive way to say &quot;My game is better than your game.&quot; Which is childish, but understandable to an extent, since it's been happening since Atari and Colecovision. It's the console wars, essentially, with everyone getting super heated and those of us who do both just sitting in the middle and wondering what the hell is going on.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm currently subbed to both, so I don't really matter statistically, but I will say that while either company mostly just cares about my 15 bucks a month, I tend to spend way more time in TOR than I do in WoW, currently. I still like WoW, but the only time I log in nowaddays is for our weekly 2 hour Dragon Soul clear.<br />
<br />
I will say, though, that Bioware seems way more eager to please. Their upkeep and maintenance methods I find much preferable to WoW, mainly on account of the whole &quot;smaller, more frequent content patches&quot; that Blizzard mentioned a year ago, seems to actually be possible with Bioware. To me, it seems like TOR is the game with the more advantageous position going forward, but that's also pretty much implied, considering Warcraft's age.<br />
<br />
And as far as losing subs goes, it's a foregone conclusion that once you reach a certain market share, it's far easier to lose customers than it is to both retain the ones you have AND gain new ones. All this doomsaying just comes across as irrelevant at best.</div></div><hr />

And stop picking a timeframe of one month in comparison to an entire expansion. Ill repeat what i said once again because i can see youre just trying to argue for the sake of arguing. During Burning Crusade when their philosophy wasnt catered towards the casual playerbase their subscriptions started soaring and continued to do so during Cata. They have done NOTHING but bleed subs this ENTIRE expansion. Losing 100k subs isnt &quot;stabilizing&quot;. Once again, this ENTIRE expansion theyve done nothing but lose people. Did i say it enough times? Now gtf outta here and take your boat back to denial land.<br />
<br />
<br />
All I can say is apparently BLIZZARD is happy with how things are going. Regardless of the ranting about how great BC was. Its gone, over, done with, put out to pasture. Not sure how many different ways we can say it. WELCOME TO THE NEW NORMAL. Quite frankly, if you cannot and refuse to accept that this game has moved to catering to the casual playerbase, its time to leave. This is how it is, this is how it will remain for the foreseeable future. Apparently Blizzard came up with that decision and they are content with it. I guess 10.2 million other people agree with it.</div></div><hr />
