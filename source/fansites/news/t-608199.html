Kil'jaeden Soul Flay Hotfix<br />
Soul Flay now targets the player with the highest threat against Kil'jaeden, regardless of the distance between the player and Kil'jaeden.<br />
We've just deployed a hotfix to all regions that changes the targeting behavior of Kil'jaeden's Soul Flay ability. The ability now has a much simpler rule to determine who will be targeted.<br />
<br />
Soul Flay now targets the player with the highest threat against Kil'jaeden, regardless of the distance between the player and Kil'jaeden. The normal threat buffer that prevents a creature from changing targets to someone outside of melee range does not exist with Soul Flay. Soul Flay will still not target a player who is immune, however.<br />
<br />
This change will likely change some of the strategies currently used by players against Kil'jaeden, but our intention is not to make the encounter any more or less difficult. This change should result in a more consistent, more understandable, and more enjoyable Kil'jaeden fight.<br />

Carrot on a stick stacking / getting it back<br />
I think it's been well established that the riding crop does not stack with the carrot on a stick/spurs/enchant, as well as the proper way to request an item restoration by petitioning our in-game support.<br />
<br />
That aside, we wouldn't make an item obtained in the 30's level range work with any future speed increases, either now or in the foreseeable future. We would effectively be requiring people to either go back and complete the quest if they hadn't, or doom our in-game support to hundreds of thousands of petitions for item restorations which could probably not be met. Save yourself the hassle, all you need is the riding crop. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=6762241485&amp;pageNo=3&amp;sid=1#54))<br />

Naxxramas-80 in WotLK<br />
It will be an entry raid dungeon, yes, but if you are in the same group that was able to complete it at level 60, I doubt you will be in there too long, so it will work out for the more experienced raiders as well.

Long quest chains and rewards<br />
It depends on what you consider &quot;end-game content&quot;, there is already a lot of quests that can be complete solo that are the end-game of solo play - some of them are a fairly long series as well and they will reward players with gear appropriate for the level of difficulty (like the blue item rewards). Some of these series in The Burning Crusade required players to go through the 5 person dungeons, so these things already exist to a degree.<br />
<br />
We have always put a lot of quests into our new zones and Northrend will be no exception. As players hit the new level cap, the challenges will grow and that is what leads players to focus on the 5 person dungeons, then the heroic dungeons, then on into raiding. If players were able to complete a long quest chain while solo-ing and it provided end-game gear, then it would be like removing raiding (as I previously brought up) because this would allow players who play a lot to race through it all and get things very quickly. So the rewards for any series of quests or dungeons will always need to be on par for the challenge and not automatically end-game gear.

The carrot on a stick/naxxramas/long quest chains posts all seem fairly sensible to me. Particularly the quest chain one. It seems sensible to me that solo quests should give a green quality reward; maybe the odd blue for the harder quest chains. 5-mans should give blue rewards, with perhaps the odd epic, and raiding should give epic rewards. Simple, really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So if solo rewards are restricted to greens with the odd blue, 5-man rewards are restricted to blues with the odd epic, and it takes at least 10 to get consistent epics... all PvP should reward greens and blues then, yeah? I guess 5v5s could get the odd epic, and there's an argument for BGs to be considered a raid, but we all know it's more like 10/15/40 solo chickens with their heads cut off.<br />
<br />
Seriously, splitting it up based on the number of players required to complete the quest is just asinine. First off, you can make epic quests that require raid participation to complete but that still have a large amount of solo content. An example that comes to mind is the Priest quest for Anathema. It's not long per se, but has an epic feel... I know I for one had to do that event multiple times before I got it down, and I had a hell of a lot of fun doing so. It still required raiding to get the eye, but it had a fun and engaging solo portion that also had a bit of story to it. There's absolutely no reason other than pure laziness that Blizzard can't make epic quests with epic rewards. If they're concerned about epics requiring certain numbers of people to acquire, start the chain in a raid instance, whatever. But seriously, throw us storyline fans a bone every once in awhile... after the utter void of plot in TBC I'm about ready to go back to EQ, regardless of how bad of a game it is.</div></div><hr />

You do know that:<br />
1. Solo quests that end in raid encounters tend to be marked as &quot;Raid&quot;<br />
2. Quests that are raid encounters can have their own rewards, separate from the rest of the chain<br />
3. Quest rewards do not use an algorithm to determine the quality of the reward. There's a human who did the quest from start to finish, and the rewards are then subjectively added on rules of thumb basis.<br />
<br />
In either case, I think the whole point is to use items to reward progress, and it's a fact that 25 man raids are harder than solo quests, because a) there's 24 other people who can screw up and b) solo quests need to be slated so that a Protection Paladin can finish it in a reasonable amount of time compared to a 'lock.<br />
<br />
That only leaves PvP as the odd one out, since PvP takes time more than skill. The rating system also locks a percentage out, meaning to breach the limit you need skill to compensate the worse gear. Etc etc.<br />
PvP in WoW is simply screwed up from start to finish, and the only way I see fixing it is having non-combat rewards such as titles, mounts, badges, etc etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As was said already, a quest chain which requires raid content is....a raid quest chain. It doesn't matter that it has a fair amount of solo stuff in there, if you do not do any raids you cannot complete it. Also, BC has such quests as well, i.e. the Black Temple Attunement questchain.

Yeah, I wasn't talking about what the tag said. I thought that was clear, but apparently even the clearest statements can be misinterpreted. The BT Attunement quest chain was the closest TBC came to doing it right; it was actually decent, but they can still do a hell of a lot better.<br />

Which is harder, performing brain surgery or getting 24 friends together and all going to a nightclub?

Bad comparsion.<br />
<br />
You are comparing two different things which leads to twisted results. I.e.: Who earns more money in total? 24 people working in sweatshops or a top manager of a international company? The top manager obviously.<br />
So the number of people have no impact on the amount of money they can earn? Right.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to use the same (or very similar) things to compare something. Like a single surgeon vs a team of surgeons (yes, there are operations which require a whole bunch of them, like &quot;fixing&quot; siamese twins). Or a single basketball player trying to hit the basket again and again vs a complete team of basketball players working with each other.<br />
<br />
Group actions always have the possibility of being more complex and difficult than an action a single person can do. Because on top of performing perfectly you have in a group also pay close attention and react on what the other members of your team do.<br />
<br />
That mustn't necessarily be the case (especially in MMORPGs), but the higher difficulty *potential* of group actions is a fact.<br />
Unless both solo and group actions would be drastically different, but exactly that isn't the case.<br />
<br />
Also, even if both group and solo actions had the same difficulty group actions would still need to be more rewarding.<br />
Because organising a group is quite a bit of work. Which has to be rewarded. If not, why do it at all?</div></div><hr />

You must be joking...a quest or whatever the case maybe, that requires more people doesn't make that task harder? If you don't outgear the encounter or way above the level of its recommended for the &quot;suggested players&quot; isn't on the quest log to take up space sir. It means that if you come with less than that its going to be...harder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'll respond to you; the other two people that responded to me aren't worth the headache they'd cause me if I were to try to talk at their level. What I'm talking about (as opposed to what the tag says in the quest log) is the number of people required to complete the main portion of the quest. Going back to my example of the Priest quest for Anathema: it was a Raid quest because it required getting the eye from MC. However, once you got that item to drop, the main portion of the quest was completed solo. The tag says raid, but realistically it's a solo quest.<br />
<br />
As for it being a bad example: it's called exaggeration, and I'm sorry if it was a bit too extreme. You're completely right, if you're doing the same action (like surgery in your example) with one person or multiple people, it's going to be more difficult with multiple people. I disagree, however, with you saying that it isn't the case that the actions would be drastically different (in-game, not in surgery). A raid encounter is 25 people killing a boss... a solo quest line is one person doing something completely different from killing a boss. Again, priest quest example (sorry I'm overusing it, it just fits too well): doing that solo event is completely different from killing a boss in a 25-man raid.<br />
<br />
As far as your last question (why organize groups at all), these two facets of the game fulfill different purposes. Raiding (with groups) fills the need to kill big monsters and get several varied pieces of epic gear. Epic solo quests fills the desire for direct interaction with the storyline, and usually one piece of gear that's really cool (Anathema). They can coexist; Blizzard has even made them coexist before, they just screwed it over, hard, in TBC. The coolest quest line in TBC was, as mentioned, the BT attunement chain, and it was decent at best compared to what's doable and what has been done in the past.</div></div><hr />
