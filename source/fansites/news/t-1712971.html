<br />
First up we’re going to be providing a new screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO) method from NVIDIA known as HBAO+, targeted at higher end video cards. It provides a high quality ambient occlusion solution that should be available to most users running recommended spec machines. Here we’re showing comparisons of using no SSAO, our current SSAO High setting, and the new NVIDIA HBAO+. The HBAO+ setting uses our geometry buffer to access the screen space normals of all objects being drawn. It more accurately darkens surfaces that are near the same depth but with opposing normals, and does so with fewer artifacts than the SSAO depth-only solution. HBAO+ will work on any DirectX 11-capable video card.<br />
<br />

<br />
We know many of you have been looking forward to the return of MSAA, and we’ve also heard your requests for support of SSAA. We’re pleased to say that both of these options will be available for DirectX 11 users in Patch 6.1. They can be accessed from the anti-aliasing settings in the graphics option screen, and are intended for users with high performance video cards. For people running near the recommended spec, Intel’s CMAA is still the preferable option, and will help you balance graphic fidelity with performance. Below are some comparisons between CMAA, MSAA 8x, and SSAA 2x + CMAA. With Patch 6.1 we’ll be providing the widest variety of anti-aliasing options we’ve ever had available, ranging from performance-optimal to performance-crushing.<br />
<br />

<br />
Also in Patch 6.1 we’re implementing a lighting makeover with the introduction of per-pixel deferred point lights. This allows for accurate point lights that can affect all of the objects in the game world. This creates realistic lighting from sources like camp fires and torches, and illuminates the world in a more realistic way than ever before. The number of point lights supported varies by hardware, with high end video cards allowing for the best quality lighting. Below are several examples of a scene lit in the current game (6.0.3), and what you can expect that same scene to look like in Patch 6.1.<br />

All of this technology is available to check out on the 6.1 PTR right now, so go try them out and see how these options work on your rig, and let us know your results.</div></div><hr />

Exactly what I was thinking. I literally can't &quot;spot the difference&quot; except on the last screenshot where you can clearly see the improvement in lighting. But come on... is this what they will introduce in a major patch? I'm maybe getting disappointed too early, but considering what they've delivered this expansion I have no hope at all anymore. This better not be their top feature in 6.1.</div></div><hr />

Some people are just blind.<br />
Anti-aliasing is much easier to notice in real game.. But even in screens you can notice difference between no aa, cmaa and msaa.<br />
Donwload those pictures and cycle them on &quot;full screen&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;no ambient occlusion&quot; vs &quot;hbao+&quot; = huge difference.. New lighting technology is huge as well. <br />
You must be ignorant if you can't notice it. <br />
<br />
Can't wait.. much better than another timeless isle.</div></div><hr />

Lol, always one in every group.<br />

Yes, it is noticeable as long as your aren't playing on a typewriter. Try and just give props to Blizz for doing a solid job on something instead of turning a good thing into a personal complaint about something else. Yes, there will always be things to work on for the devs. In the meantime, this is a positive change for many of us.</div></div><hr />

But when I was on PTR, my fps dipped really low from 60 to 30 in the open world. I don't care about raids or BGs... I have different settings for that. For the open world like in Draenor zones like Shadowmoon Valley where I lag a lot when I look into a distance where there is a lot of stuff going on and moving at the same time, my FPS dips to 30 from 60. I have a i5 3570K, 7870 gigabyte card and 8 gigs ram. I want to upgrade my video card to the gigabyte g1 gaming GTX 970 and been eyeing it since December 2014 but I want the prices to drop so I can purchase it or I'll just save up some money until I can get it.

Sure it will. If it's lowering performance too much for your system, turn it down or off.<br />
Modern graphics cards are more than enough for WoW's ultra preset. The performance hit in many situations is likely related to CPU utilisation. DirectX12 might improve this considerably for some people but it depends if Blizzard will adopt it. If it's a considerable step up, then I'm sure they will.</div></div><hr />

Now, I can't wait to play it when it goes live. I find the current live version to be less than stellar to play on now.<br />
But when I was on PTR, my fps dipped really low from 60 to 30 in the open world. I don't care about raids or BGs... I have different settings for that. For the open world like in Draenor zones like Shadowmoon Valley where I lag a lot when I look into a distance where there is a lot of stuff going on and moving at the same time, my FPS dips to 30 from 60. I have a i5 3570K, 7870 gigabyte card and 8 gigs ram. I want to upgrade my video card to the gigabyte g1 gaming GTX 970 and been eyeing it since December 2014 but I want the prices to drop so I can purchase it or I'll just save up some money until I can get it. I just wish that is the only thing I need to upgrade for the next 2-3 years hopefully. Also, I don't want to overclock my i5 3570k since I am too scared to do it any mess up really bad. I bought my whole PC with the parts initially back in December 2012 on Black Friday and wanted to look into overclocking but once I started reading up on it, it confused me and scared me.

Rarely there is some raidboss, which causes fps spikes.<br />

At work i have hd4000.. on minimal i still get 25+ fps on 1920x1080.<br />

Part of the reason it looks like a big jump is because they nerfed the graphics when they released WoD, I.E the return of MSAA is better than CMAA, but we had MSAA until the end of MoP anyway...</div></div><hr />

Yeah that seems like something is wrong there, I have an i7-4550k processor with a GTX 760, it runs at 60 frames per second at 4k resolution on medium settings in most areas and about 30-40 in raids. In 1080p it sky rockets to like 150 frames and 100 in raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game runs perfectly smooth, and not only that but my GTX 780 TI GHZ EDITION never goes above 50 C. <br />
<br />
Given that I am running the game at a higher resolution than you and with every possible quality setting to max and I am not seeing any performance issues, it seems to me that you do not know how to accurately calibrate your rig/squeeze max performance out of it.<br />
<br />
This is typical with inexperienced users. In short, the hardware is fine, the game is fine. You fail at computers.<br />
<br />
I am very happy with this change.<br />

P.S.: GPU is at stock and CPU is at stock too, just increased the turbo freq to 4GHz and enable multi-core enhancement.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
<br />
How about the Depth Effects settings introduced on PTR?<br />
<br />
I tested PTR a few weeks ago and couldn't see a difference enabled/disabled, presuming they were bugged or unactivated I hoped they would be later explained. Perhaps the 'Depth Effects' is only applied to the Selfie Camera; if so then that's pretty sad. I would love to see Depth of Field introduced into the outside zones of WoW. DoF in Raids could be problematic, but outdoors would be amazing.<br />
<br />
Can anyone comment?</div></div><hr />

I had 25 fps sometimes, enabling only the needed addons (baggins/scrap for bags, skada, bigwigs, icehud and maybe one more I forgot) it runs smooth at 60 fps.<br />
<br />
Most addons are bad programmed and hit every system - espacially auction house ones, anything mit libdata/databroker, althololic etc.<br />
<br />
Anyway - the PTR Build with max Seetings (no graphic card tweaks) and max. AA runs WAY better then the current build. Better graphic and faster...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nonetheless, very impressive stuff. Big thumbs up from me.<br />
<br />
My experience says differently. Not everyone runs old equipment.<br />
<br />
i5-3570k @ 4.73GHz, Gigabyte Z77X-UD5H, 2 x GTX 980 SC SLI, 16GB DDR3-1600, 2 x 128GB SanDisk SSD RAID0, 2 x 256GB Crucial m4 SSD RAID0, 2 x 2TB Seagate HDD in RAID1, ASUS ROG SWIFT PG278Q 27&quot; WQHD 2560x1440 144Hz GSync monitor, Asus Xonar DX PCI-e sound card , Antec TruePower New 750W PSU, CyberPower CP1350PFCLCD 1350VA/810W UPS<br />
<br />
In before &quot;why did you spend all that to play a 10 year old game lulz&quot;. I didn't. I built it to play current games at settings most people won't see for years. Just so happens it runs WoW like a boss too.</div></div><hr />
