Thank you very much for the speedy reply. :) Now I get to find out how my integrated INTEL HD card will fare...runs d3 and gw2 decently well. And I don't have to buy mop just to find out it's undesirable lag if that is the case.</div></div><hr />

You're going to be disappointed, there really isn't any pre-world event this time around, basically they're giving us a scenario early that will be in the game even after Mists comes out. I was a little disappointed that they went that route, but can't really do much in that regards.</div></div><hr />

It will chug along slowly until about 8%, then it rockets to almost complete. In total shouldn't take more than 45 mins. My comp isn't that high tech.</div></div><hr />

Well ive been sitting at 0% for 30 minutes, it looks as if it hasnt even begun to download yet, &quot;Reconfiguring game files. Please wait&quot; is what it is saying. 30 minutes seems a bit too long for it to start, maybe i can change something in my settings?</div></div><hr />

There hasn't been any resolution to these issues (with maybe some exceptions), so there's definitely going to be another extension of maintenance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ginn</div><div class="date">2012-08-28, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For everyone worried about the optimization being stuck, try giving it some time. Mine was at 1% for 45 minutes then it jumped to complete and started downloading the remaining 2 or 300 megs for the patch. Yes, some people it will take longer, some shorter. But just open your resource monitor and verify you see atleast one &quot;Agent.exe&quot; process running, that lets you know its indeed doing something and the % displayed is probably just lagged or something.<br />

Also, wtb servers</div></div><hr />

Its hard to imagine that a team of peeps have been working on servers for 12 hours straight. That is crazy lol.<br />
<br />
EDIT: They're not anticipating the servers being up this time around, lol. Safe to say it'll probably still be worked on till 5pm PDT.</div></div><hr />

You're right, but if we can state with confidence that the patching will go on until late in the day, why can't Blizz figure out the same thing? Do they really believe it'll be different this time? It's boggling that they can't figure out something as simple as &quot;oh wow, big patch today, don't plan on playing before 5pm EST&quot;.

Because on the rare chance it does go up when they are expecting it to, which has happened only a handful of times, it's good. They don't want to that the servers will be down for 12+ hours as people freak out that way as well. There's no win/win for them on this one. They post they'll go up at 3pm when they went down at 3am, outrage that the servers are going to be down so long. Put that it's up at 11am and keep extending it, outrage that it was extended. You can't win this one. <br />

Very few have a problem with waiting. What we *do* have a problem with is throwing out numbers and times that have no bearing on reality. If you're in any kind of business, especially for 15 years, you should know that it's always better to underpromise and overdeliver than overpromise and underdeliver.

Do you honestly have nothing better to do?<br />
<br />
Most likely when we get on, they will still be performing realm resets for an hour or so to keep it stable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you planned your whole day around playing WoW on a patch day you haven't been around WoW for very long. This is normal for Blizzard, they tend to pick a time that they would be done without any major hiccups, but stuff happens. Everyone should know better than to expect things to work perfectly right away. <br />
<br />
The issue is that most of Cata there wasn't this issue, so people got used to normal patches and never thought twice to say, &quot;way to go Blizzard you were on time or even early for this patch&quot; They just wait until one goes long and get pissed.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">workhabits</div><div class="date">2012-08-28, 09:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is to be expected to a point. It would be nice if they stopped dangling the carrot a bit and gave us more accurate times. If they had to push to 3 clearly they should have known the 2 hours they told us they needed at 11 was a bit off or very optimistic. Either way it will get here soon enough. Hopefully whatever they are doing now saves us form armies of bugs and disconnects.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard likes watching us NERD RAGE and want to see how long it takes to get to that point.... I didnt start my NERD RAGE til the last extended period....RAGE ON!! MY FRIENDS</div></div><hr />

Very few have a problem with waiting. What we *do* have a problem with is throwing out numbers and times that have no bearing on reality. If you're in any kind of business, especially for 15 years, you should know that it's always better to underpromise and overdeliver than overpromise and underdeliver. That's just common sense, and has nothing to do with the technology involved.<br />
<br />
So when was the last time you updated an entire enterprise with a new Exchange Server and pushed out new MS Office software to every computer in the company? You are aware there are multiple server farms in the US for WOW that have to be updated must likely remotely, which can change your time estimate by bandwidth restraints.</div></div><hr />

Then why even bother QQ?<br />
<br />
If you KNEW it would happen, cause it always happens, why didn't you guys just expect it to happen and prepare for a pushed back patching time..... You know, but not getting all worked up for the time they first set, but instead aim for the long time they always use?<br />
And even if you didn't know it would happen, what do you think it helps to whine about it here? Venting some rage, maybe but.... come on, it's not really something to rage about.<br />
<br />
EU player myself so patch won't be applied before later tonight anyway. So my plan is to stay up untill servers goes down, then sleep untill i wake up by myself. That way i'm almost 100% sure the servers are up. Cause i don't wake up early if i don't have to :p</div></div><hr />

To give Blizzard credit, it was actually 41 seconds before they posted the 2pm-3pm change. So they got us by seconds.</div></div><hr />

I was goingto say the same thing, not the same reference, but I don't know why the don't just say like 8pm and then when they get it done at 3:30 then people will be like &quot;WOW Blizz you are so efficient,&quot; rather than &quot;ARGG I hate all of you.&quot;</div></div><hr />

When was the last time you accurately judged your job's time requirements? As I said, if you tell me something will take 6 hours, then it should take 6 hours. IF you tell me 24 hours, that's fine, I'll plan accordingly. If you tell me something will take 6 hours and then make have a gazillion &quot;extensions,&quot; then you're not doing your job correctly. I don't care what business you are in. If you have no freaking idea how long it will take, then don't give an estimate. Very simple principles. But they do require ethics and character.</div></div><hr />

They are the ones getting paid to do it. They are the ones setting the times. I have no problems waiting for maintenance, its the constant changing that bothers me. I know its not intentional but this carrot on a stick thing pisses people off.<br />
