I know that last year a lot of the normally free swag required some slip of paper or token from the goodie bag. Sadly, I was unable to make it out there this year due to a serious case of unemployment, which has now thankfully cleared up. (I still have the rash, though. Hopefully that'll go away on its own.:))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paid just as much? Blizzcon ticket 150$ virtual ticket 40$. Unless I'm really bad at maths I hardly think you can call that paying 'just as much' for it.<br />
<br />
And the virtual ticket gives you the pet and the Starcraft icon.<br />

Nice a bunch of junk and not worth the price paid for a Blizzcon ticket. JMO.<br />
<br />
And yet Blizzcon is still losing Blizzard a shitload of dollars each year. They could just not organise it and be better off financially. Or not give a goodie bag and people would still pay and attend it. People should be happy they even get anything at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yet they, as a company, still do hold it. You're right - they must be doing it out of the goodness of their hearts and so that their bosses at Activision can sleep better at night with a warm fuzzy feeling. The fact that they get a massive promotional event that thousands of people attend that focusses on only their three products with no conflicting advertising from any other game company (and complete control over the message) - which in turn generates huge amounts of industry and press attention on those products and millions of dollors worth of free advertising is besides the point. Also besides the point is that even the actual costs of holding it get offset (at least in part, I have no idea if what you say about ticket prices not offsetting the cost of holding the event is true) by the fact that the core target market of that advertising will *actually pay* to be advertised to....like I said, all those things are beside the point. After all, they're doing it for the fuzzy feelings. And the kids. And puppies. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I think Blizcon is a fantastic idea, it's great for fans to have an event like this - but let's not kid ourselves that it isn't great for Blizzard, too.</div></div><hr />

The fact that they get a massive promotional event that thousands of people attend that focusses on only their three products with no conflicting advertising from any other game company (and complete control over the message) - which in turn generates huge amounts of industry and press attention on those products and millions of dollors worth of free advertising is besides the point. Also besides the point is that even the actual costs of holding it get offset (at least in part, I have no idea if what you say about ticket prices not offsetting the cost of holding the event is true) by the fact that the core target market of that advertising will *actually pay* to be advertised to....like I said, all those things are beside the point. After all, they're doing it for the fuzzy feelings. And the kids. And puppies. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I think Blizcon is a fantastic idea, it's great for fans to have an event like this - but let's not kid ourselves that it isn't great for Blizzard, too.<br />
<br />
This^^<br />
While Blizzard might lose alot of cash on Blizzcon and not earn it back with the tickets themself, the PR generated from such an event holds alot more value to the company than anything else, now with the live stream they're also able to sell even more tickets and get more cash to minimize their losses and gain even more PR/dollar spent. :)</div></div><hr />

Eh, they'll just release two non-combat pets and another mount in their online store and make back every penny that the event ended up costing them. These guys print their own money. Plus, if you've ever been to a Blizzcon you know that the store there is *packed* from the second Blizzcon opens to the last minute of the convention. They sell TONS of merchandise during this event... so while ticket sales may not cover the cost of the event the rest of the stuff (including the money I'm sure they get from their partners at the event like Nvidia, Intel, Figure Prints, Jinx T-shirts, DirecTV, etc. etc.) surely does. It's a good time for sure. I've just gone the DirecTV route this time, but I've been to two of them and it's well worth the price of admission.</div></div><hr />

It gives you a chance to unlock a couple of loot chests at the Steelseries booth. If one of them unlocks, you get to keep what's in it.<br />

<br />
You can't be serious, BlizzCon is profitable, or else Activision would shut it down. They are a public corporation and if the board of directors do not see a positive cashflow from an activity they will force the CEO to get rid of the cost center.<br />
<br />
At 30,000 * $140 that's over $4 million dollars and they do not have to pay additional for any staff because they use Blizzard employees. All the equipment is rented and their major costs are renting the building, hiring Jay Mohr &amp; Tenacious D, and paying contest prizes.

No, it's not directly profitable. Companies do things that are not directly profitable all the time. It's called marketing. I used to work for SGI. We did 20-30 large computer shows a year. We *paid* for a spot on the floor, *paid* for all of our booth gear, *paid* for employees to go, and *paid* for the swag we gave out. Our direct income was $0 per show. Net losses were in the low millions (per year, not per show). We still still did it every year and were thankful for the chance. It's a great way to get out and connect with the people who buy your stuff. Blizzard probably losses a few million buck on BlizzCon every year. They still do it and it makes them more than they lose in the long run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were just talking about how smooth the pre-Wrath patch was in guild the other night. We were raiding and clearing content the night it was released. The night of 4.0 we were the only guild on the server with the balls to raid, but ran into boss bugs on 4 bosses, not to mention the plethora of other bugs and issues we were having. I don't feel 4.0 was any smoother than 3.0, but I'm perfectly fine with that considering the COMPLETE overhaul to basically every system, world, quest, and UI feature in the game.</div></div><hr />

BlizzCon makes a profit. If it didn't make a profit or result in an measurable increase in sales - it simply would not happen. Only an irresponsible corporation would waste the shareholder's money in a profitless venture with no chance at return on investment. I'm sorry, I know it sounds cutthroat, but that's how public corporations work. You don't get to do stuff for fun, it's only about maximizing profit and minimizing cost.</div></div><hr />

You are aware that there's one main stage stream that IS closed captioned, and one that is NOT closed captioned?<br />
<br />
VOD will function for all four zones of the thing. Don't sweat the small stuff.</div></div><hr />

Just WoW fans, they are never happy with anything, but will shell out money for it no matter what. They resent Blizzard for their products and the fact that they waste their time and money playing something they apparently don't enjoy, Blizzcon is no different.</div></div><hr />

That statement is akin to saying that there are no girls on the internet, or that only people who are 'good' at video games are virgins. You're an idiot :)</div></div><hr />

Same here, but kind of sucks... Demo was perfect in HD &amp; their uber-RayV-Player &amp; now livestream is handing on buffering on everything but &quot;low&quot; quality... Not nice at all; if they can't handle the traffic, they shouldn't advertise &quot;virtual ticket in HD&quot; and such... :( <br />
<br />
But yeah, can affirm this - &quot;normal&quot; / Flash player working perfectly, but quali nowhere near to youtube HD or 720p...</div></div><hr />

Reading the more vocal parts of the game - the forums particularly - he has a point. Not a huge one, but a point.<br />

Good stuff so far, but I'm not interested in Diablo.</div></div><hr />
