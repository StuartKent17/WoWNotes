Upcoming Honor Items and Honor Reset<br />
As many of you know we will be featuring a new Battleground, a dedicated world PvP zone and all new PvP items in Wrath of the Lich King. In order to make the transition from The Burning Crusade to Wrath of the Lich King flow as smoothly as possible, all accrued honor points will be reset at the launch of the expansion. We do this to ensure select players do not have an unfair advantage at level 80 from stockpiling honor to instantly purchase the newest Wrath of the Lich King PvP rewards. For those with unspent honor points prior to the release of the expansion, we will be offering a few upgrades and special rewards in next content patch solely for purchase via the honor system. <br />
<br />
I read special items and now that's all I care about. Screw the upgrades what are those &quot;special&quot; things going to be?<br />
The items should be on the PTRs now, or very soon. <br />
<br />
Same as others have posted, curious about what will happen with pvp tokens/badges accumulated? possible to get a blue to clarify this please?<br />
Marks of Honor will be wiped as well. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Health of players and pets boosted in WotLK<br />
Yes, we improved base health of players at higher levels. We're also going to improve pet's health to match it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/10043221906-did-our-premades-health-get-buffed.html))<br />

Heroic Dungeons bug fixes<br />
Azjol-Nerub - We ran into the issue with Anub'arak not wanting to stay burrowed internally, and have a fix that the next beta patch should pick up. There was also an issue with Hadronox not using his web pull ability that will be fixed next go around. It's in the LFG system now too, thanks for that bug. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10043246811-918-feedback--azjolnerub-heroic-80.html))<br />
Halls of Lightning - We've been tuning this dungeon from both internal and your feedback over the last week. Loken should be a bit more manageable with some specific strategy adjustments based on some changes we've made. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10043246845-918-feedback--halls-of-lightning-heroic80.html))<br />
Gundrak - Thanks for the Gundrak feedback. We've been tuning various elements of the fights, and the difficulty should be a bit more even. Slad'rah also drops loot from his Heroic table now, nice catch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10043246829-918-feedback--gundrak-heroic-80.html))<br />
The Oculus - The Heroic Bosses in Lich King should not drop the same loot as their non-Heroic counterparts. If it does, it's a bug. Eregos not dropping Heroics has been fixed in the next beta build, and he won't evade. We've also been tuning various elements of the different fights to make them more understandable. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10043246809-918-feedback--the-oculus-heroic-80.html))<br />
Utgarde Keep - Thanks for the feedback, and we found the issue with the Helm dropping in two places. The trash creatures on Heroic have a different table to pull from that their normal counterparts. A quick check looks like they seem to be order. If you have further information about what specifically dropped the item that would be helpful. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10043246864-918-feedback--utgarde-keep-heroic-7072.html))<br />
Utgarde Pinnacle - The encounter team has been playing through Heroics and that gauntlet was... rather vicious. Fun, but vicious. We've toned down the gauntlet in Heroic. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10043246786-918-feedback--utgarde-pinnacle-heroic-80.html))<br />
Halls of Stone - We've fixed the trash mob dropping 1 of 3 blue items every time. We've also tuned down the Brann event based on our own internal feedback and yours. Thanks! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10043246831-918-feedback--halls-of-stone-heroic-80.html))<br />
Drak'tharon Keep- We're tracking down several of the instance geometry issues currently, thanks for those reports. We've also fixed some bugs with the first boss not being attacked by trolls. Thanks, all. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10043246840-918-feedback--draktharon-keep-heroic-80.html))<br />
The Nexus - Thanks for the feedback, Keristrasza and the other bosses definitely got some tuning over the last few days based on internal and beta feedback. We also threw in a little something extra to the Ormorok encounter for Heroic. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10043246788-918-feedback--the-nexus-heroic-80.html))<br />
CoT - Stratholme - Greed now has Stamina instead of Spirit. We noted a lot of the same difficulty feedback in our internal playtests as you all did, and the bosses all got a little bit of attention and tuning. There's also a new timed event for Heroic that I'm interesting in you all trying for the next beta patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10043246765-918-feedback--cot-stratholme-heroic-80.html))<br />
<br />
Raids dungeons bug fixes<br />
Naxxramas (10 Players) - Four Horsemen chest is fixed internally, next beta patch should have it back. The issue with the infinite respawning spiders in Faerlina's hall is something we're looking into right now. Next beta patch should have the issue with the Faerlina hall fixed. Kel'Thuzad's Mana Detonation was inadvertantly made WAY more extreme than intended, this is also fixed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10043246757-918-feedback--naxxramas-10-player.html))<br />
Obsidian Sanctum (10 Players) - Thanks for all this feedback, we're continuing to tune various elements of the encounter and fix the bugs that pop up. Glad to see you are all having fun with the instance. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/10043246801-918-feedback--obsidian-sanctum-10-player.html))<br />

Brewfest and mount availability<br />
After more discussion on the matter, we have hotfixed Coren Direbrew to drop the Brewfest Kodo and the Brewfest Ram for both Alliance and Horde. You now have an equal chance to get both mounts regardless of your faction! The droprate they have makes them uncommon but not very rare. The mounts that Coren drops are permanent. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10043238782-brewfest-and-mount-availability.html))<br />
<br />
Brewfest 2008 changes<br />
Brewfest Mounts - These festive mounts are no longer purchased with tickets. Instead, they are random drops off of Coren Direbrew.<br />
New Locations - New locations have been added for Brewfest this year; now even more brew is accessible!<br />
Brew of the Month Club - Do you wish that Brewfest could last all year long? Join the Club... literally!<br />
Dark Iron Invasion - Dark Iron Dwarves are back! Having been silenced mid-event last year, they are angrier than ever. So instead of partaking in the fun, they'd rather crash the party<br />
<br />
Quest changes<br />
&quot;Pink Elekks on Parade&quot; - Removed.<br />
&quot;Catch the Wild Wolpertinger&quot; - Removed.<br />
Wolpertinger Pet has been added to the Brewfest token vendors and is available for 50 silver.<br />
The quest &quot;Did Someone Say &quot;Souvenir?&quot; has been replaced with &quot;Say, There Wouldn't Happen to be a Souvenir This Year, Would There?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Last minute notes<br />
Failing the ram race will make the players unable to try the quest again for 12 hours.<br />
The tickets have changed to tokens from other years, if you want you can exchange them for the new ones.<br />
The Dark Iron fight is not awarding tokens anymore due to a bug. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/5963126537-2009-brewfest-2008-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Reasons behind the removal of the Wolpertinger and Pink Elekks quests<br />
In order to fix the quests and add them back into Brewfest this year, we would have to not only make the requisite changes (which is not difficult in and of itself) but get all the new text localized into the nine official languages the game supports, have QA test the content to ensure the changes are working properly, and create a patch for all regions to bring the content due to the nature of the changes being unhotfixable. All of this combined is a bit more work than you seem to believe, and wouldn't happen for this year's Brewfest in any case. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10043229535-elekks-and-wolpertingers.html))<br />
<br />
Achievement - Ahune Tabards<br />
Ok we fixed it. If you have the Tabard of Summer Flames or Skies you'll also get the achievement. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/10043089489-will-ahune-tabards-give-cred-it-for-ahune.html))<br />
<br />
Achievement - Check for Thunderfury for the Molten Core completion achievement<br />
Done. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/10043320155-suggestion-molten-core.html))<br />
<br />
Tabards taking a lot of inventory space<br />
We don't have any immediate plans for a Tabard UI but something to consider is that the Tabard vendor in Dalaran sells most of the tabards for very cheap. There really is no reason to hang on to them unless you're wearing them. Also, the Tabard vendor there will replace certain quest Tabards (such as the Tabard of the Illidari) if you destroy it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10043230585-many-tabards.html))<br />
<br />
Motorcycle Mount<br />
Guys, there is a reason the motorcycle is on vendors for 5 gold. We're trying to hammer out all of the bugs before declaring it ready for prime time. The motorcycle is intended to be a FUN mount that lets you and a buddy cruise around the world in style. It will be an engineering crafted item that will not require engineering to own/drive. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/15/10043218992-motorcycle-mount-is-op.html))<br />
<br />
Armored Brown Bear Mount<br />
The brown bear will probably stay priced how it is in Beta. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10043241692-armored-brown-bear.html))<br />
<br />
Grand Caravan Mammoth mount<br />
The mammoth will be operational in the next build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10043219732-grand-caravan-mammoth-mount-bugged.html))<br />

Ahn'Qiraj legendary mount<br />
It's a bug. Scarab Lords will not get a flying mount. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10043279599-scarb-lords-being-rewarded-again.html))<br />
<br />
Mallet of Zul'farak / Goblin Transponder in key ring<br />
We have plans for these items (and getting them out of your bags). Unfortunately, we won't be able to get to it in time for Wrath of the Lich King, but we do want to eventually address how these work. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10043219927-suggestion-mallet-of-zulfaraktransponder.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/deathknight.jpg Death Knight (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / Talent Calc. (8970) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
PvP changes<br />
Death knights have a lot of options at the moment, which is cool, but makes it really hard for another player to catch a break and burn a death knight down. So we're going to try some changes. I won't sugar-coat it -- these are nerfs.<br />
The ghoul is doing too much damage. He is receiving 100% of death knight strength, which is much higher than most pets.<br />
Chains of Ice is going back to be being dispellable. It is probably the best snare in the game at the moment, for a class that already has Death Grip.<br />
The same is true of both Strangulate and Mind Freeze. Strangulate's cooldown is going to go up. Mind Freeze remains the quick interrupt.<br />
We're increasing the cooldown on Anti-Magic Shell. We don't think this will hurt DKs in PvE much, and it still leaves you with Icebound Fortitude to use often.<br />
As always, if we overdid it, if DKs are now too weak in PvP, we'll adjust. But we were at the point where we weren't getting a lot of good numbers because some fights were just over too quickly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043242718-pvp-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Winged Steed of the Ebon Blade<br />
Updated model coming in the next build. Let's stop the hate. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/8765643365-winged-steed-of-the-ebon-blade.html))<br />
<br />
Death and Decay / Blood Boil's new graphics<br />
The previous version (the dark smoky one) made it hard to see what was going on. We started to hear &quot;DK, don't use that spell!&quot; on boss fights. Not good. The NPC spell swap was a temporary fix to see if it resolved the problem. There is a new Death and Decay and Desecrate art that should be in next build... or possibly the one after that depending on when they take data. Both do a better job of showing you the outer limit of the effect, which is generally the most important thing to know (for DK and victim). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043322395-dnd-and-blood-boils-new-graphic.html))<br />
<br />
Death Coil changes<br />
Death Coil's coefficient was increased. We more recently changed the base points, say from 390 to 440 at rank 5. You probably don't have this last change yet. If you used a Death Coil every rotation, that's a lot of extra damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043241651-death-coil-damage.html))<br />
<br />
Desecrate bug<br />
Desecrate's damage not working is actually a code bug so it's a little hard to fix. We've obviously known for some time that it's a problem but it's not a trivial one to fix. We'll get it eventually. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043280802-make-desecration-give-us-the-5-dmg-buff.html))<br />
<br />
Is Frigid Death Plate working currently ?<br />
With a 100% chance to fire, the buff is always up. It would just be a permanent icon every time you entered combat. Think of it as a passive buff if that helps. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043171070-is-frigid-death-plate-working-currently.html))<br />
<br />
Rune Strike / Frost Strike / Death Coil balancing<br />
I personally don't find the comparisons to the old Kill Command very apt. Kill Command was an almost trivial cost so it always made sense to use it whenever it was up. Rune Strike on the other hand uses 15% of your total runic power, or more than 30% of a Death Coil.<br />
<br />
We found that the real problem, IMO, was Death Coil and Frost Strike weren't hitting hard enough relative to other DK abilities, so they didn't feel like they were worth the button push, and subsequently, building up runic power didn't feel like a big deal. Both Death Coil and Frost Strike received serious buffs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043320446-rune-strike-remove-it.html))<br />
<br />
Ghoul DPS is too high<br />
The ghoul does too much damage. He gets, IIRC, 100% of the master's Strength, which is very generous when most pets scale at 30% or so of the master. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/10043230285-ghoul-vs-felguard.html))<br />
<br />
We're not removing the Ghoul. We did structure Unholy's talents in such a way that you can completely skip over the Ghoul if you don't like pets. This is a different tact than we took with Demonology or Beast Mastery. You can get fine dps out of Unhloly through AE spells or focus on Scourge Strike. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043240801-unholy-ghouls-doing-too-much-dps--etc.html))<br />
<br />
Interaction of Frostbite + Fingers of Frost<br />
It is intended that with both Frostbite and Fingers of Frost fully talented, Fingers never triggers independently. It is not intended that the Fingers procs get consumed too early when that happens. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/4/10043216370-interaction-of-frostbite--fingers-of-frost.html))<br />
<br />
Scourge Strike nerf<br />
We lowered the percent weapon damage on Scourge Strike because it was the only ability that ended up scaling too well. Several other abilities didn't scale well enough and we made adjustments accordingly. But even after those changes, at some gear level Scourge Strike would have outpaced other DK abilities, forcing everyone to go Unholy. Bypassing armor is just a huge benefit. We dropped the weapon damage down to 60% but then buffed the flat points. I suspect the bugs you're reporting are more due to the crit / hit problems. However, even though Scourge Strike does Shadow damage, it should still be able to be blocked, dodged or parried. Those are properties of melee attacks. Scourge Strike is not a &quot;spell&quot; even though it does magical damage. It crits for 200% for example. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043219156-8970-bug-list.html))<br />
<br />
Upcoming bug fixes on beta<br />
&quot;Wandering Plague is still getting resisted all the time.&quot; Think we finally fixed this. Whew. <br />
&quot;Desecration still does not grant +5% damage. &quot; This is reported fixed but I can't verify yet. <br />
&quot;Death and Decay is being affected by Crypt Fever. &quot; Fixed. <br />
&quot;Shadow of Death still buggy, not always triggering on death &quot; Need to figure this out. It could be that the data gets messed up when existing DKs get the new data without talents being wiped.<br />
&quot;Necrosis&quot; I know it's annoying, but not all abilities will work right on target dummies. Try and specify when you notice a bug if it was on these, a mob or another player. <br />
&quot;Death Pact bugged&quot; Still looking into this. <br />
&quot;Death Runes not working right when you have &gt; 1&quot; Still looking into this. <br />
&quot;Rime not working.&quot; We are trying to make this talent work better, but it's going to take some code. Known issue for now. <br />
<br />
Edit - Scourge Strike doing correct damage again. Strikes consume Cinderglacier. Rime works now as intended. They tell me Desecrate works now. We'll see. Hopefully you will see these changes next build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10043219156-8970-bug-list.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/druid.jpg Druid (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=700) / Talent Calc. (8970) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid))<br />
New druid form arts<br />
It's not going to be in for Lich King. Sorry. Doing an entire animal texture takes a lot more art than a hair change. But we all agree it's high time for new druid form art. It's a high priority after Lich King. You absolutely deserve new skins and we want to do it right, and we want to do it soon. I don't want to promise any more specifics than that until we see what problems arise when LK ships and what we need to fix. In our opinions, Raven Lord and epic flight form set the bar. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10043217819-ghostcrawler--koraa.html))<br />
<br />
Mangle (Cat)<br />
Are you going to use cat Mangle a little less now? Probably. But it's hardly the only talent with situational use. I'm not sure that warrants a redesign of the talent. I'm not even sure you can assume someone with Trauma will be around all the time. I do think changing Mutilate has opened a door that is difficult to close on positional requirements. But I'm not sure we have enough evidence yet that cat PvP damage is low at all, or is low because of Shred's requirements. Mutilate was a slightly different situation since it was competing against other rogue builds. Mangle and Shred are abilities every cat is going to have. Now if it makes you much worse than rogues in PvE or PvP, that is something we'll look at. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10043251807-gc-the-plight-of-mangle-cat.html))<br />
<br />
Balance Tree<br />
While I'm sure every class would say this, it's probably no surprise to you that Balance damage was low. Way too low.<br />
<br />
We are addressing most of it through base spell damage changes to Wrath, Insect Swarm and especially Starfire. Hopefully that will give you some more talent choices because some of the damage talents will feel more optional (or as optional as more damage ever feels), instead of the bare minimum you need to be close to other casters.<br />
<br />
We also fixed a few bugs with Star Fall and Typhoon. Not sure those changes will boost dps much, but playing your class should be less annoying. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10043238273-more-moonkin-math.html))<br />
<br />
Swipe target limit<br />
We are still working on Thunder Clap and Swipe. We think paladins can AE tank fine and DKs are probably close. Warriors and druids are still limited by the target limit of their abilities. Removing the target limit may be the answer, but we want to explore the issue first. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10043316557-thank-you-for-buffing-swipe-but.html))<br />
<br />
Restoration Tree<br />
We don't want to hurt Regrowth, because it is nice to finally see it being used a lot. My fear is that the glyph is making it a lot better than Nourish.<br />
<br />
Ideally, and I don't know if we can get them all to this stage, glyphs should be an option that changes the way you play your character, not just free talent points. In some cases, they are going to feel like buffs. It would be cool, for example, if the Regrowth glyphs let some Resto druids focus more on Regrowth while others used different spells. The Regrowth glyph is just so good, on top of the Regrowth talent, that it may be a non-decision to use which also ends up making Nourish useless.<br />
<br />
Ideally you should want to use Regrowth and Nourish on some occasions. Flourish, Rejuv, Swiftmen and Lifebloom already have pretty decent niches. If glyphing for Regrowth makes you lean towards that spell, awesome. I just think the case at the moment is every druid will have that glyph and use Regrowth as a generic heal-all spell.<br />
<br />
We're not going to touch the Regrowth talent or other synergistic talents, at least not to solve this problem. <br />
<br />
Will a Resto Druid be able to handle all aspects of healing like a Holy Priest such as Prot Warrior is going to be able to handle all aspects of tanking like a Prot Pallie? <br />
No, that isn't the goal. The reason is largely because encounters are designed such that you already want to take more healers on a raid than you have available specs. What I mean is that almost every 25 player will have Holy paladins, Holy priests, Resto shamans and Resto druids. And maybe a Disc priest too. Even a 10 man will have 2-3 healers, and most likely they will be different classes. That's a different situation than the tank is in. There are very many raid encounters that require one tank while almost none that require one healer. By and large, I think we've done a decent job in giving healers niches, but that strategy hasn't worked for tanks (and won't really work for dps either).<br />
<br />
Now, where we have needed to give healers more tools is in the 5-player case, and possibly PvP. The same tools are useful in unusual encounters, say a Loatheb where you can't heal often, or a Void Reaver, where the paladin has to run around. A Holy paladin who is great at flashing heals on a MT can't do that in heroic Nexus and expect to keep everyone alive. A druid can't just keep rolling Lifeblooms up and keep everyone alive. Wild Growth is great in those situations. It's probably not going to compete with Chain Heal, but it doesn't really have to. It just gives you another tool in your box.

Pets to become stronger<br />
Yeah, the pet stat layout has totally not kept up with the times. It needs an overhaul and we hope to work on it as soon as LK ships. Aside from players just knowing what their pet's stats are, it will help people improve their pets, as well as help us realize where the problem areas are.

Philosophy behind the changes to AoTV<br />
AotV is like any mana back mechanic, you sacrifice damage or power while regenerating mana. A mage has to stand a channel Evocation, a Warlock has to use global cooldowns and health to use Lifetap, a Paladin has reduced healing while using Divine Plea, etc. That's not to say you also have talents such as Efficiency, Rapid Recuperation, Invigoration etc. to also give you passive mana regeneration without having to use Aspect of the Viper.<br />
<br />
We always intended Aspect of the Viper to be used as an Aspect you go to when you needed mana. Previously Hunters were just using Aspect of the Viper nearly all the time, because the passive regeneration was better than the added damage of hawk.<br />
<br />
We want Hunters to care about their regeneration, we want them to like mp5 on their gear. You should want to be efficient in your DPS so you don't *have* to go to Aspect of the Viper. Just like how a Mage tries to be efficient so he doesn't *have* to use Evocation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10043172833-feedback--hunter-mana--viper-concerns.html))<br />
<br />
AoTV changes<br />
Frankly, Hunter's DPS right now is balanced with Aspect of the Viper in mind. If we, say, reduced the amount of time you were in it drastically or the damage penalty we'd have to do something equivalent of reducing Hunter's total DPS by at least 10-30%. While you guys might not notice it with the pre-mades, the Hunter class is currently king of DPS.<br />
<br />
What I do buy is that when you're soloing, between pulls or not able to attack, you aren't gaining the regeneration. What we could do is make the regeneration passive and not require you to attack, but basically just regenerate mana. (It would still have the damage penalty though) <br />
<br />
The mana is not based upon your damage. It is a general rule now to not make your mana scale with damage or healing etc., because mana doesn't scale as fast as those stats. What it does is regenerate a % of your base mana relative to your weapon speed (nullifying the need to have a fast or slow weapon to game the aspect).<br />
<br />
What we're going to do is balance the passive regen to be around the same as if you were attacking the target. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10043172833-feedback--hunter-mana--viper-concerns.html))<br />

Arcane Blast nerf<br />
That (buffing one spec and declaring it the PvE raiding spec) is certainly the easier way to balance classes, but we are gluttons for punishment and are trying to make the various different ways to play a mage viable in a raid setting.<br />
<br />
Arcane Blast ended up being so good that we were concerned you could remove all your other buttons, and that every mage would go spec deep Arcane. Rather than just nerfing it, we are trying mechanics that let pushing the button be awesome, but pushing it twice in a row be less awesome. For what it's worth, I would be very surprised if the 300% penalty was our final implementation of this spell.

Divine Plea<br />
I believe the only change we are making right now (aside from some general bug fixing) is a change to Divine Plea. Divine Plea will have a longer duration but the same total percent mana returned per cooldown. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/10043222777-incoming-ret-nef-for-pvp.html))<br />
<br />
Shield of Righteousness<br />
Shield of Righteousness was going to scale way too well as a multiplier on block value. We already saw cases where it was 40% or more of paladin dps with very few hits. I'm not sure if you got the entire change in with the hotfix, but it's now 100% of block with a flat component and two ranks. See how it feels in the next beta build.

Hammer of the Righteous<br />
We're going to buff Hammer of the Righteous. That should even out with the Shield of Righteousness nerf, plus give you a little more reason to hand that +spell power blade back to the warlock.

<br />
Holy Paladins<br />
Yes, we would like to fix Judgments of the Pure. I still maintain that except for the mechanics introduced in the later BC content, paladins would have still been &quot;the best healers&quot; (whatever that means). I can say that because I know that's partially why those mechanics were introduced. <br />
Number of heals -- aside from the old stand-bys, we tried to work Holy Shock, Sacred Shield and BAcon of Light into your arsenal.<br />
Mobility -- Holy Shock helps a lot in this department too.<br />
Beacon of Light -- If you poke around a little bit, you might find that a lot of paladins do like this spell. It requires some babysitting -- no doubt about that. But we also figured with your relatively small number of healing spells, you could afford (perhaps even welcome) the distraction.<br />
Mana Regen -- Divine Plea is what you use when you run out of mana. It's not there to make mana go away -- it's supposed to have situational use. If there was never a decision to use Divine Plea, then we would have just doubled your mana pool. Losing healing effectiveness is supposed to be that decision. Now if you just don't have enough mana to do your job, that's a different problem.<br />
If you're worried about another healing class just outperfoming you to the extent you get parked, then that is a totally valid concern because I agree that it did happen in Sunwell. But as you well know, it's hard to heal a training dummy or whatever and figure out if you're an effective healer. The only decent test for it, aside from some theorycraft, is going out in groups. As we get numbers back if we see that Holy is falling down, we'll fix it. <br />
<br />
[...] We'll take a look at Judgments of the Pure and Enlightened Judgments, since those come up a lot in the feedback threads. We already had plans to make Sacred Shield scale its damage absorption. We've gotten some bugs fixed with Bacon, so check that out next build (or so). <br />
<br />
Then go out and heal and see what happens. We'll keep a close watch on the numbers and make sure you aren't getting pwned by other healers and see if there are still encounters that render you curb-worthy. I don't think there are, but I might be wrong.<br />

Holy Priest changes<br />
Improved Holy Concentration -- We'd like to keep this based off spell crit. Its possible we're too conservative with the numbers. As for other crit talents, Surge of Light now also procs an instant flash heal. (We're looking into fixing the Surge of Light/Improved Holy Concentration bug with them eating each others charges btw)<br />
Desperate Prayer -- We had to give it a mana cost to balance the spell with its new cooldown (It went from 10 minutes -&gt; 2 minutes).<br />
Divine Providence -- 10% healing for any healing spell that heals more than one target is pretty good. Granted its not very complicated or flashy, but I don't think that makes the talent bad. I mean we could tack on something like &quot;Your healing spells are increased by 10% when your mana is above 50%&quot; but that would really just be tacked on in an effort to make it feel different and interesting.<br />
Test of Faith -- Compare it to Holy Specialization(5% crit), its 6% crit and 6% healing for 3 points vs 5% crit for 5. 50% happens more often than you'd think, and extra healing and crit chance is most important when a target is at 50% or under.<br />
Guardian Spirit -- I agree with this, we boosted the heal from 10% to 50%. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/10043172588-five-ways-to-fix-holy-quickly.html))<br />

Imp. Power Word Shield switched with Imp. Inner Fire<br />

Shadowpriests in WotLK<br />
We test single target DPS with blue, epic and green gear. In all trials the Shadow Priest was doing more than expected DPS, I believe it was around ~2500 in epics. This was solo in a 5-minute trial (without raid buffs). In a raid setting, your DPS would probably be significantly higher. In a nutshell, we feel we've made a lot of progress in our goal of bumping the Shadow Priest DPS numbers/scaling to where we want it to be. Unfortunately players won't really be able to see these numbers on their characters because you are using low tier PvP gear. (Referring to the pre-mades we have on Murmur) <br />
<br />
Shadow Priests raid buffs are Misery and Replenishment. We removed a lot of +% spell damage modifiers throughout all classes. Those that do exist are exclusive with similar debuffs. This is all part of our goal to simplify the requirements of a raid group building/composition. In return, we significantly scaled Shadow Priests damage up. <br />
<br />
If you have a Moonkin or Shadow Priest present in your raid group regularly, your raid can nix 3% hit off their itemization budget. As for the talent not being always useful for the Priest (say, everyone is already hit capped) it now provides a selfish boost to the Priest (15% coefficient scaling on three spells). <br />
<br />
Shadow Word: Death was initially created as a finisher spell. While the glyph may not be amazing in a raid setting, it's quite useful soloing to finish off mobs or in PvP where you want to finish off foes.There's something for everyone in the new glyphs, it's very difficult to please every flavor of Priest (PvE Holy, PvP Holy, PvE Shadow, etc.). The nice thing about glyphs is that we can add new ones whenever we want, so expect new ones throughout the patch cycles. <br />
Without Dispersion, Shadow Priests would not be PvP viable. Our goals were to 1] Lower the Shadow Priests raid utility but increase their personal DPS, 2] Give the Shadow Priest more PvP mobility and survivability, and 3] Give them a new niche/gameplay (AOE damage with Mind Sear). I think we accomplished all of those goals. Its quite possible we may of not went far enough (or even too far), but we'll find that out soon enough and do changes where necessary.<br />
<br />
While Dispersion might not drastically increase your raid damage, not all talents are designed as such. We experimented with giving it some added DPS to it, but we had to take it off because the Shadow Priest was exceeding our bench mark for DPS. It was also strange gameplay (what if you got hit while it was channeling? You'd feel really bad. Also its supposed to be your defense mechanism in PvP, but yet now you want to use it for DPS?)

Riptide changes<br />
We improved the base heal by 33% (Not sure if you have that build or not). It also now procs Tidal Waves, and we've changed Tidal Waves to two charges now (up from 1). Also, Improved Water Shield will affect Riptide. <br />
<br />
Riptide unlinked from Imp. Chain Heal<br />

Thunder Clap threat generation<br />
The threat on beta was reduced because the damage was increased.<br />
<br />
Give me some time to a full analysis of the numbers though and I'll post them here. It could be you aren't factoring in something, or it could be we have a math problem somewhere.<br />
<br />
As I said in another post, we are still figuring out how the damage, targets, threat and cooldown of Thunder Clap. One of the problems with the numbers before the most recent nerf is that at high gear levels (beyond Naxx I mean), Thunder Clap would do more damage and threat than many other core warrior abilities. It would go from being situational to being in your main rotation (aside from the debuff which you obviously want to renew). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/10043241017-thunderclap--the-math.html))<br />
<br />
Thunder Clap target limit<br />
We are still working on Thunder Clap and Swipe. We think paladins can AE tank fine and DKs are probably close. Warriors and druids are still limited by the target limit of their abilities. Removing the target limit may be the answer, but we want to explore the issue first. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10043316557-thank-you-for-buffing-swipe-but.html))<br />
<br />
Compensation to devastate nerf<br />
It will probably be in Revenge or Shield Slam, but we're still working on the exact implementation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/10043279193-devastate-nerfed-where-is-the-compensation.html))<br />
<br />
That suggestion helps fix the issue of dps warriors trying to use Devastate, but I think Devastate has now become too much of Prot's damage as well. Devastate worked well in BC because it was generally inferior to Shield Slam and Revenge, but you still got to use it plenty of times. But the Sword and Board change together with Devastate's higher damage means that Revenge seems to fallen by the wayside for a lot of Prot tanks. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/10043279859-suggestion--regarding-devastate-ghostie-.html))<br />
<br />
Revenge<br />
It would be nice to buff Revenge since it seems to have lost some of its BC luster, but if indeed the problem is dps, especially when not tanking, then Revenge won't do as much. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/10043279668-so-just-tried-prot-after-nerfs.html))<br />
<br />
Damage Shield being parried<br />
This is a bug. It should always do damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/10043240217-can-damage-shield-be-parried.html))<br />
<br />
Titan's Grip balancing<br />
Titan's Grip needs a counter-balance because two-handed weapons are more powerful than one-handed weapons. Period. Nobody would argue this I imagine or else you wouldn't be interested in the talent in the first place.<br />
<br />
So the only thing that is really in contention is whether the increased dps is higher than we typically offer in one talent point. We think it is. We tried it as a 5 point talent, but that felt awkward because it was one of those where the first talent point expenditure is worth so much more than the additional talent points.<br />
<br />
Once the dps numbers are balanced, if we see a lot of Fury warriors skip over Titan's Grip, then we'll know our estimates were off and we'll lower the penalty. I don't predict that will happen, but I make bad predictions sometimes like everyone else.

<br />
hear is a thought maybe blizzard needs to make an arms and fury dps tier set . they need different stats . the points you put in ignor armor can stay there for arms warriors and be a step in the right direction for thoughs of us ( not me included have 270+ hit w/31+ crit and 2100+ ap set up for change granted sacraficing alot of ap ) who will need hit to make it work . added strenght to prot set to make it work ? just a thought that would bring balance between arms and furry in addition both sets will have same itiem level gear but give arms warrior more ignore to help balance end game dps</div></div><hr />

- Locks won`t get killed during rogue stunlock on live at least.<br />
- Lock pets are not one shottable. Fel hunter is weak against melee but not one shottable and voidwalker definately is not one shottable.<br />
- Locks are very capable of CC:ing if their partner druid (yes that`s what they all play with) is not totally handless.<br />
- warriors can be feared.<br />
<br />
And retardins are stupidly op on ptr even they are in great denial themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
LoL, why not then give melee some stuff to do while they get merciless hammered by ranged attacks (not to mention spells that go fully trough armor) if they can't get in melee range fast enough? LOL<br />
<br />
Locks (and other spellcasters) should really now that their weakness is melee combat... lol, wan't full damage attacks and full melee mitigation? LOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL every class needs to be weak in something (well, except for locks? hahaha), this isn't a generic fps deathmatch, each class is diferent :P</div></div><hr />

That steady shot kill command macro was great for dps in TBC. Not anymore tho. Kill command is a 1 minute cooldown now and just spamming that macro wont grant you top dps. Survival on the other hand requires a lot more that spamming one button. Since traps and stings now give extra shots you got to use those on top of using explosive and steady shot. Plus all the other cooldowns. So thats why i laugh at those of you who think that spamming a macro grants top dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm...maybe I'm stating the obvious but considering that EVERYONE has the chance to stockpile honor and marks right now on live, I fail to see how an &quot;imbalance&quot; is created. Whats the difference between stockpiling now vs. later? Considering that theres not much left to do in BC the least Blizz could do is give players some way to be productive now. Some way for &quot;dedicated&quot; players to actually, ya know, be rewarded for being dedicated. Seems to me that Blizz is doing this to appease those who are just hitting 70 or will be shortly before LK hits. But if i've been playing for much much longer and have been at 70 for much much longer, why shouldn't i get rewarded with being able to purchase LOW TIER PVP GEAR a few weeks before everyone else.<br />

Oh well, just another reason to cancel my acct till LK comes out. Have fun not recieving my money Blizzard :)</div></div><hr />

I have to more or less agree with this. Many guilds will stop raiding, leaving pvp as the only source entertainment while being somewhat productive. With this announcement though, there's no reason to pvp before expansion goes live...and no reason to raid, so what reason do we have to play at all?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imagine it if you could just save your honor/arena points. <br />
Then all quest rewards, all first levels of 80 rewards would be pointless. Everything..<br />
<br />
So..<br />
It does make sense that Blizzard has made that decision. <br />
<br />
I can say.. YAY that they have done that!! So we can have fun and slow lvling and exploring Wotlk and receive new rewards from quests,dungeons,worlddrop etc etc, and some of pvp maybe!!<br />

<br />
Man, I'm guessing TG's going to stay as a 15% miss rate. That's laughable, they don't want TG to be a talent they want you to HAVE to take yet who the hell's seen someone spec Arms without MS, Fury without bloodthirst, demonology without soul link, Disc without pain supression?<br />
<br />
Why do they have to destroy such a cool talent point for those who won't gimp themselves with pure hit rating in end game raiding? It's annoying how the most fun talents are the ones that get taken away or just completley gimped while we're stuck with boring talents that just boost your Dps silently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right now, shadow priests got a HUGE boost in dps (roughly +900 base damage). With spirit tap and a handful of other talents that buff spirit to mana conversion, mana is NO problem at all for spriests. My best friend plays a spriest and shaman, and I play a pally and mage. We're both in beta and have ran a lot of instances together. Dispersion, even though it silences him for 6 sec, coupled with a shadowfiend (same 3min CD), gives him back at least 60% mana on avg and 70% on a good day; add the shadowfiend glyph to the mix and ur talking another 5% backup if the fiend dies early. I see the changes to spriest in wotlk being very much like how the spec was in pre-BC.<br />
Sure, raid utility has been nerfed and spread across the board, but I think that Blizzard wanted to make this an option and not so much a mandatory job, while everyone else gets to pew pew. Bottomline: dont QQ when you can pew pew, L2P.<br />
<br />
<br />
Concerning the honor/arena/marks dump:<br />
<br />
I find it borderline humorous that everyone who took the time to sit and constantly Q up for arena and BG's expecting to go in wotlk with maxxed out numbers and tokens looking to be the first to grab all the intro lvl 80 pvp gear. Why would Blizzard let that 10% of the community who took this route, go in at lvl 80 and monopolize the arenas (mostly) with their full set of pvp gear, while everyone else sits there hopeless. It simply is not fair. I can hear the arguments now: &quot;Well, wtf? why can't the hardcore people who maxxed their honor out keep it? We worked hard for that crap. It's not our fault 90% of WoW didn't take advantage of the plan.&quot; You pretty much said it right there. There's one thing to prepare yourself for something, and another to take advantage of a situation to ride easy kills at lvl 80 when ur rolling a poop-load of resil and pvp stats and beat johnny and his friends with their pve gear trying to get points.<br />
<br />
Concerning warlocks QQ:<br />
<br />
I mean seriously? Seriously? You want to be melee mitigated too? I love how &quot;balance&quot; of the game quickly turns into &quot;I want pretty much what they have...but better...and more my style&quot; Bottom line is this, when you as a class can own the living CRAP out of everyone once you make the first move, it's nothing to whine about. Sure, rogues can stunlock you, but isn't that the mechanic of their class as a defense against casters. A lot of other class can own the shit out of them. Everyone has their weakness opponent class. Live with it and L2P.<br />
<br />
Concerning &quot;Meh&quot; 51 pt talents:<br />
<br />
A lot of classes have EXCELLENT 51 pt talents (Ex: Shamans spirit link, Pally's Beacon of Light, Hunter's Beat Mastery for exotic pets, etc, etc). Not only do these 51 pt talents change the way we play, but they fit in a rotation that makes us more powerful than we were in TBC. From ALLLLLL the posts I've seen, what people really want is a NUKE spell or ability. Something that is totally chaos in a jar exploding into the raid, but only for a couple of seconds. Blizzard poops that stupid idea. Why would they give you a total gimick DPS/HEAL/UTILITY spell when it could cause so much problems (threat, wiping, mana draining, health draining, rage draining, etc)<br />
Trust me.....everyone in City of Heroes and Villians got those COOL 51pt talents (Nuclear explosions, Blizzards, and firestorms) and how many times do you see people use those in instances/missions? NONE. <br />
<br />
<br />
We have about 6 weeks or so till WOTLK. Don't panic and start vomitting QQ all over the forums. New implementations (meaning new spells, talents) are about over. I'd say we have abot two weeks till patch 3.0.2, which means if ANY new spells are put in, it's going to be very soon. But after 3.0.2 they're setting their sights on balance and balance only. Anything else left to fix, won't be fixed till weeks after the release, if that (maybe months).<br />
<br />
IMO....if you have a beta key, PLAY, LVL, run instances, THEN come back and QQ when you have a valid argument, with ideas that can fix the problem. If you don't have a beta key and have just been fanboying the forums, please...take a step back....and stfu, you know absolutely nothing if you haven't even played the new class yet in beta.<br />

And how am I out of the loop?<br />
All those arguments I posted are valid and true via testing in beta.<br />
I don't usually read forums b/c its all about QQ over complete craptastic ideas, but I felt compelled to post a little from testing classes on beta.</div></div><hr />

a void walker who can sacrifice himself for a &quot;super pw:shield&quot; (while they are stunned and if the warlock can play!)<br />

Then how the HELL am I going to survive as a priest, with less stamina and health, less armour and unable to do anything while stunned?

Statements like this make me think that some people are living in the pre-BC days when fear was worth crying about. <br />
<br />
With DRs, the cast time, the 398493849838498 ways to break it, including DoT ticks, DD spell, or pet damage- if you are seriously being feared until dead, then you are a horrible player, have crap gear, cannot play your class and deserved to lose.<br />
<br />
Only bad players allow themselves to be feared.<br />
<br />
I'd be more than happy to remove fear from the game if I had an actual defensive spell to use against melee.</div></div><hr />

They've given them everything that made the other classes unique plus they have more oh-shit buttons than anyone. Damage shield, possibly removing the cap on thunder clap, better mitigation than druid/DK.<br />

<br />
Fear is still a force to be reckoned with even post BC even with ways to escape it and DR. I do agree locks need a better defense against melee but not one thats effective against every other class across the board.</div></div><hr />

OK, I had to quote this one small part of that big post that I mostly agreed with... because this part is unbelievably funny.

It's like saying warlock's demonology 51 point talent needs a counter-balance because it actually buffs the warlock. No kidding? A 51 point talent SHALL buff the class, NOT put it on equal field to wielding 2x onehanded weapons. +- zero, what's the point with putting it as an end talent then if it doesn't make a difference? <br />
<br />
<br />
The design goal, as explicitly stated by Blizzard, is one talent point = 1% DPS increase. Titan's Grip with no drawback would be a much larger than 1% DPS increase. Therefore, it cannot be a one point talent with no drawback.<br />
<br />
Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

Just because someone hit 70 later than you automatically deems them an idiot? How about people who are great players but re-rolled an alt that just hit 70 and now they want it to become their main?

<br />
Right now, shadow priests got a HUGE boost in dps (roughly +900 base damage). With spirit tap and a handful of other talents that buff spirit to mana conversion, mana is NO problem at all for spriests. My best friend plays a spriest and shaman, and I play a pally and mage. We're both in beta and have ran a lot of instances together. Dispersion, even though it silences him for 6 sec, coupled with a shadowfiend (same 3min CD), gives him back at least 60% mana on avg and 70% on a good day; add the shadowfiend glyph to the mix and ur talking another 5% backup if the fiend dies early. I see the changes to spriest in wotlk being very much like how the spec was in pre-BC.<br />
Sure, raid utility has been nerfed and spread across the board, but I think that Blizzard wanted to make this an option and not so much a mandatory job, while everyone else gets to pew pew. Bottomline: dont QQ when you can pew pew, L2P.<br />
<br />
<br />
Concerning the honor/arena/marks dump:<br />
<br />
I find it borderline humorous that everyone who took the time to sit and constantly Q up for arena and BG's expecting to go in wotlk with maxxed out numbers and tokens looking to be the first to grab all the intro lvl 80 pvp gear. Why would Blizzard let that 10% of the community who took this route, go in at lvl 80 and monopolize the arenas (mostly) with their full set of pvp gear, while everyone else sits there hopeless. It simply is not fair. I can hear the arguments now: &quot;Well, wtf? why can't the hardcore people who maxxed their honor out keep it? We worked hard for that crap. It's not our fault 90% of WoW didn't take advantage of the plan.&quot; You pretty much said it right there. There's one thing to prepare yourself for something, and another to take advantage of a situation to ride easy kills at lvl 80 when ur rolling a poop-load of resil and pvp stats and beat johnny and his friends with their pve gear trying to get points.<br />
<br />
Concerning warlocks QQ:<br />
<br />
I mean seriously? Seriously? You want to be melee mitigated too? I love how &quot;balance&quot; of the game quickly turns into &quot;I want pretty much what they have...but better...and more my style&quot; Bottom line is this, when you as a class can own the living CRAP out of everyone once you make the first move, it's nothing to whine about. Sure, rogues can stunlock you, but isn't that the mechanic of their class as a defense against casters. A lot of other class can own the shit out of them. Everyone has their weakness opponent class. Live with it and L2P.<br />
<br />
Concerning &quot;Meh&quot; 51 pt talents:<br />
<br />
A lot of classes have EXCELLENT 51 pt talents (Ex: Shamans spirit link, Pally's Beacon of Light, Hunter's Beat Mastery for exotic pets, etc, etc). Not only do these 51 pt talents change the way we play, but they fit in a rotation that makes us more powerful than we were in TBC. From ALLLLLL the posts I've seen, what people really want is a NUKE spell or ability. Something that is totally chaos in a jar exploding into the raid, but only for a couple of seconds. Blizzard poops that stupid idea. Why would they give you a total gimick DPS/HEAL/UTILITY spell when it could cause so much problems (threat, wiping, mana draining, health draining, rage draining, etc)<br />
Trust me.....everyone in City of Heroes and Villians got those COOL 51pt talents (Nuclear explosions, Blizzards, and firestorms) and how many times do you see people use those in instances/missions? NONE. <br />
<br />
<br />
We have about 6 weeks or so till WOTLK. Don't panic and start vomitting QQ all over the forums. New implementations (meaning new spells, talents) are about over. I'd say we have abot two weeks till patch 3.0.2, which means if ANY new spells are put in, it's going to be very soon. But after 3.0.2 they're setting their sights on balance and balance only. Anything else left to fix, won't be fixed till weeks after the release, if that (maybe months).<br />
<br />
IMO....if you have a beta key, PLAY, LVL, run instances, THEN come back and QQ when you have a valid argument, with ideas that can fix the problem. If you don't have a beta key and have just been fanboying the forums, please...take a step back....and stfu, you know absolutely nothing if you haven't even played the new class yet in beta.<br />

<br />
Btw, don't be &quot;stupid&quot; pretending that (what I think it's your problem) it's not right saying that they only care about Arena now (wich, in fact, is true). They did the honor/marks reset because of ppl QQing about the arena points reset. Reset that makes sense since it's about a season with &quot;begin/end&quot; and a reward at the end of it. Not to mention that you can grab honor/marks while leveling, but can't get arena points before you reach 80 and start a new team for rated matches, so ppl with Arena points stocked can buy some arena gear (that is better than the honor gear) right away as soon as they have the pre-requisites for it and get a nice headstart chance for the season's end rewards while the others will also have wait for the necessary arena points to buy gear.<br />
<br />
And the problem isn't even that, it's that it's stupid that you can loose your Arena points ONLY when you level to 71, but loose honor + marks even at level 70 as soon as they launch WotLK.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh, you can buy the lvl 80 gear at 70 and then level! That's why they'll wipe the Honor/Marks&quot;. The answer? &quot;level 80 required&quot; to buy.<br />

With the power of some one-handed weapons avaiable... lol at that. As ppl say in beta, they're now with a DPS decrease penalty for choosing TG. What other 51-talent has this nice &quot;bonus&quot;????<br />

Does it need a drawback? Yes<br />
That much to a point where DW one-handers is better or just a little bit worse? No.<br />

<br />
No, your argument is stupid, because you are just finding anything you can to complain to Blizzard about and accuse them of loving arenas. I'm not saying they don't, I'm saying your argument is just retarded. You want a reason for me saying that? Not that I need to, but just for you...<br />
<br />
There is NO POINT in having honor at 70 when WotLK comes out if you can't keep it all the way to 80, so why complain about being able to keep arena points until 71? I don't even get why you would be whining about something so retarded.<br />
<br />
You can't buy the first level arena gear without honor points anyway, and unless you feel like grinding out honor before you hit 71 when LK comes out(which would be pretty hard to do considering everyone would be leveling so there'd be no one to do BG's with) your arena points will be wiped before you can even use them. So stfu, and &quot;kkbyethx&quot; to you. <br />
<br />

I stand corrected. Characters that have not been created yet cannot stockpile honor, you're right. The paladin that I have yet to create on my account cannot stockpile honor either.

If I understand correctly Blizzard is arguing that the ability to buy LOW TIER PvP rewards as soon as you hit the level cap would create an imbalance among lvl 80 players because those that took the time to stockpile honor will immediately dominate in all aspects of PvP against those that didnt stockpile honor, thus making it difficult for those who didnt stockpile to build up points/marks/honor whatever in order to get their gear. They call this an &quot;unfair advantage.&quot; I disagree. It's a completely fair advantage, and one thats existed through all of BC.<br />
<br />
Soooo...when you level an alt to 70 and want to PvP, what do you do. Because everyone else got their arena gear a few months ago, you probably go grind BGs and honor in order to get a few welfare pieces before starting arena, right? Will you get absolutely pummeled in the lvl 70 bracket for until you get some decent pvp gear? Of course you will. But eventually you will get a few pieces and break into the arena scene. Here you will play low rated times, slowly making your way up the ranks, gathering gear along the way. Voila, your alt is has good pvp gear (if youre skilled).<br />
<br />
Not to mention, doesnt the arena rating system itself solve this &quot;imbalance&quot; problem? Players who stockpiled and bought all their gear will quickly move up in ranks, while the majority of players who didnt will hover around 1500 until they start to get gear. So after a few games, youll be playing relatively balanced matches. Imbalance problem solved.<br />
<br />
There will be an imbalance in BGs you say? Ahhh but theres always been an imbalance in BGs. You learn to deal with it.<br />
<br />
Players who stockpiled and bought gear at 80 will be able to kill you while your questing you say? You poor poor thing. Transfer off a PvP server or learn to get ganked once and a while. It happens all the time.<br />
<br />
I guess my point is, alts have always found a way to break into the PvP scene. Its not that difficult. I've done it, so have many of you probably. By Blizzards logic in this decision, we may as well reset honor and marks server-wide as soon as ANYBODY hits 70. Cause that would be unfair for them to have to work their way up :(<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, I almost forgot. Alts who just now leveled to 70 and are in lvl 70 quest reward gear and gear from lvl 70 5-mans are going up against players in season 4. Yet they seem to manage. So I doubt there will be *that* much of an imbalance between players in quest rewards/instance loot and those in what currently exists as the lowest tier of pvp gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
**********************<br />
<br />
A Russian peasant eeking out a poor existence plowing his near frozen fields, (Note: I have nothing against Russians or peasants, thats just how the version I read was told), was working in his field one day when his plow hit something metallic. He bent over and dug out of the ground an ancient brass lamp. While cleaning it, he rubbed the lamp and out popped a genie. <br />
Thanking the peasant, the genie promised to grant him one wish, anything he wanted, with one string attached. Whatever he wished for, his neighbor would get double.<br />
The Peasant thought for a moment, and said. &quot; I wish to be blind in one eye.&quot;<br />
<br />

The problem isn't that people playing this game are being treated unfairly, the problem is that they are acting like a bunch of fkn peasants.<br />

and what argument u wanna use for keeping honor, but not arena points/badges prior to LK release? since every single arena piece will need arena rating, it woudlnt hurt, too? or badges used to items of t7 quality? yea, if all of these will be kept, then whatever, ill stockpile my favorite and im set, but why should honor be any different than those 2?</div></div><hr />

<br />
WTF, there is a lot of people that waste a lot of time ( 1 o 2 month = 26€) to get honor and mark for this reason... Why not reset the gold so? i don't have gold but I have a lot of Honor and marks in my characters, the gold at lvl 80 can unbalanced the game so, you can buy al pattertn set and items (like the epic rings of lvl 80) but if you don't have gold, you can't<br />
<br />
If blizzard reset honor and marks, the must reset the gold so</div></div><hr />

Also i hope they take single marks of honor to turn in instead of all 4 bg's. that only makes sense to me since theres no point in farming bg's anymore.</div></div><hr />

if you reroll . its your fault . not mine because i farmed the honor/marks (i did for fun the av ones but the rest was like...took me months to reach 100 marks of that)<br />
if you reroll . its not my fault . ofc i'm gonna have a unfair adventage(sp?) over you . but thats not my fault . you decide to reroll . ofc you gonna have a unfair advetage(sp?) betwen you and somebody who was 70 some months ago and don't reroll . at least . for the time being<br />
or did you pretend to reroll . reach 70 . and have a balance betwen you and somebody who have been 70 and been playing on same char for half year ? <br />
btw like the other dude said...everytime ANY char reachs 70 we need to reset marks honor and arena points...its a unfair adventage betwen him and the ppl that have been playing for a few weeks/monts/years at 70 . lol . seriusly that made me laugh<br />
