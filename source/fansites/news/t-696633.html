<br />
General<br />
Copied Test Realm characters are not copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
The amount of Honor awarded for an Honorable Kill has been increased by 100% for characters of all levels. Given that all avenues in the game which award players with Honor do so with a calculated conversion from a specific amount of Honorable Kills, this change means that all Honor players can obtain through various means will be increased by 100%. To offset against this in two key areas, experience gains in Battlegrounds have been reduced by 50% and Honor awarded for completing each Wintergrasp weekly quest has been reduced by 50%. When pairing the Honor rewarded from Honorable Kills being increased by 100% with the 50% Honor reduction from Wintergrasp weekly quests, and 50% experience-gain reduction from completing objectives in Battlegrounds, players will notice no change in the net amount of Honor or experience awarded in either case.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
&lt;ul&gt;&#13; The Random Battleground system has been added! Similar to the Random Dungeon system in the Dungeon Finder, players can now queue for a random Battleground.&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; The Random Battleground option can be found in the Battleground tab of the PvP frame and is only available for level 80 characters at this time.&#13; If this option is selected, players may not queue for specific Battlegrounds and a random Battleground simultaneously.&#13; Similar to the Random Dungeon system, players will not know for which Battleground they are chosen when selected from the queue until they zone into the Battleground.&#13; The Random Battleground option will only allow a group size of 5 players to queue together.&#13; Bonus rewards will be offered for choosing the Random Battleground option.[ul]&#13; Winning a Battleground using the Random Battleground option for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency and 25 Arena points.&#13; Winning additional Battlegrounds using the Random Battleground option after the first random win will award players with 15 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13; Losing a Battleground using the Random Battleground option will award players with 5 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13;[/list]&#13;&#13; Daily Battleground quests have been removed in place of the Random Battleground option.&#13; Battlegrounds will no longer award Marks of Honor.&#13;&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; Players with existing Marks of Honor can still turn them in to their respective faction's quest givers, including individual marks for those who may have more marks for one Battleground than another.&#13; Items which previously required Marks of Honor will have their costs adjusted to remove these requirements.&#13;[/list]&#13;&#13; Whenever a Battleground has the holiday bonus active, it will now be referred to as &quot;Call to Arms&quot; in the Battleground tab and Calendar. In addition, Call to Arms Battleground Honor rewards have been changed.&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; Choosing a specific Battleground with the Call to Arms bonus active will yield the exact same rewards as when choosing the Random Battleground option.&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; Winning a Call to Arms Battleground for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency and 25 Arena points.&#13; Additional Call to Arms Battleground victories after the first win for a player that day will award them with 15 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13; Losing a Call to Arms Battleground will award players with 5 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13; When using the Random Battleground option, players will not receive additional rewards if the Battleground chosen is under the Call to Arms bonuses. In addition, the rewards for the first victory of the day cannot be earned more than once, regardless of whether or not it is obtained from the Random Battleground system or the Call to Arms Battleground.&#13;[/list][/list][/list]<br />
<br />
Wintergrasp<br />
The internal balance system now only changes when a faction achieves 2 consecutive defenses after an initial capture of Wintergrasp, up from 1. You can find additional details here: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=23329393344<br />
<br />

Classes: General<br />
Several raid buffs have had their ranges increased to 100 yards, up from 45 yards, to prevent select buffs from repeatedly getting applied and removed during highly mobile encounters. Some buffs, such as paladin auras, totems, shouts and Blood Pact are intentionally meant to have shorter ranges and remain unchanged.<br />
<br />

<br />
Auction House<br />
<br />
&lt;ul&gt;&#13; If the Auction House on a realm is unavailable for any reason, an alert will pop up informing players who attempt to access it.&#13; Players can now Right-Click to place an item in the Auction frame.&#13; Entire stacks of a specific item type can be placed in the Auction frame and several options have been added for choosing how to list auctions.&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; Stack Size: If a stack of items has been added to the Auction frame, players can select the size of the stack they wish to sell. If an invalid stack size is entered (i.e. a stack of 21 Saronite Ore), the Create Auction button will be grayed out.&#13; Number of Stacks: In addition to selecting the size of a stack, players can select how many stacks of an item they wish to sell (i.e. if a player has a total of 43 Saronite Ore in the Auction frame, they can choose to list 2 stacks of 20, 4 stacks of 10, 8 stacks of 5, 43 stacks of 1, etc. If the number and amount of stacks listed results in a remainder, the left-over items will be placed back in the player's bags automatically).&#13; Stack Size and Number of Stacks are linked mathematically so that altering the variables of one may automatically calculate the amount of the other (i.e. if a player puts 20 in the Stack Size field and 43 Saronite Ore are in the Auction frame, the Number of Stacks field will change to 2 by default. If a player only wishes to sell one stack of 20 Saronite Ore, the Number of Stacks field can be manually changed to 1).&#13; Price: Players can now choose to input the price of an item Per Stack or Per Item by selecting either option from a pull-down. If Per Item is selected and a player is selling a stack of that item, the Auction House will multiply the selected Per Item price by the amount of that item in the stack. If Per Stack is selected, the player can enter the total price he or she wishes to charge for each stack of that item being listed.&#13; Auction Post Completion Bar: If multiple items or stacks of items are being listed at once by a player, a Posting completion bar will appear showing the total progress of each individual auction being listed once the Create Auction button is selected. The greater the number of individual listings being made in a single press of the Create Auction button, the longer this process will take. Players can still browse the Auction House while the Posting completion bar is in progress, but moving around will interrupt the progress, similar to moving while attempting to create multiple bandages with First Aid. Just as with creating bandages, auctions that were completed prior to the character moving or otherwise canceling the actions will successfully be listed.&#13;[/list][/list]<br />
<br />
Dungeon Finder<br />
The Deserter debuff given to players who leave a dungeon prematurely when queuing via the Random Dungeon option has been increased to 30 minutes, up from 15 minutes. The cooldown for using the Random Dungeon option remains 15 minutes.<br />
The Random Dungeon cooldown is no longer displayed as a debuff. Instead, players will see the cooldown time remaining displayed in the Dungeon Finder window when Random Dungeon or Random Heroic Dungeon is selected from the pull-down.<br />
If a player in your party has the Deserter debuff, or is on cooldown from the Random Dungeon option, his or her character name will be displayed in the Dungeon Finder window listed as &quot;On Cooldown,&quot; preventing the group from queuing.<br />
Anyone in a dungeon party can now re-queue their group for a dungeon, as players will still be prompted whether or not to accept their chosen role.<br />
Players who use the Vote Kick option will now be prompted to provide a reason for kicking a party member. This reason will be presented to everyone in the party except for the person voted to be kicked.<br />
When joining as a group, more generous level requirements will be used instead of Random Dungeon level requirements so that players of different levels joining together will be eligible for a greater number of dungeons.<br />
World Event bosses (such as Ahune for the Fire Festival) will now be accessible through the Dungeon Finder. Players must use the Dungeon Finder to access these bosses.<br />
Parties randomly created via the Dungeon Finder will always be arranged in the party interface from top to bottom in the following order: tank, healer, damage, damage, damage.<br />
If a random party is created via the Dungeon Finder and a player cannot roll Need on an item, a reason will now be provided.<br />
<br />
Quest Tracking Feature<br />
<br />
&lt;ul&gt;&#13; The Quest Tracking Objectives Frame can now be widened via the Interface Options menu.&#13; The short description for a tracked quest is now displayed on the Map in the quest pane.&#13; Quest items in a player's inventory which begin quests now each have an exclamation point overlaid on their icons to make them more easily identifiable.&#13; If a players selects Track Low Level Quests, the quest objectives will no longer appear dim on the Map, nor will the exclamation points appear dim over NPC heads or on the Mini-Map.&#13; Objectives Frame&#13;&lt;ul&gt; The Objectives Frame will now list the number of quests displayed at the top. In addition, players can now click on the word &quot;Objectives&quot; at the top of the Objectives Frame for a list of sorting and filtering options which will determine how quests are ordered. Any quests or achievements filtered or sorted out of the Objectives Frame are still being tracked and are simply hidden in this frame.&#13; Sorting&#13;&lt;ul&gt; Sort by most difficult quests.&#13; Sort by least difficult quests.&#13; Sort by quests closest in proximity to the player (this will automatically update as players travel around).&#13; Manual sorting: This allows players to Right-Click on each quest name in the Objectives Frame and determine in what order they should be placed.&#13;[/list]&#13; Filtering&#13;&lt;ul&gt; Toggle achievement tracking.&#13; Toggle completed quest tracking.&#13; Toggle tracking quest objectives in other zones.&#13;[/list][/list]&#13; Players can now Shift + Click on a quest objective or check the Track Quest box on the Map to track a quest in the Objectives Frame.&#13;[/list]<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
When speaking to an NPC for which a player has 2 or more quests and not all of them are complete, the incomplete quests will now correctly show as a gray question marks in the dialog box. In addition, repeatable quests will be properly colored as blue exclamation points or question marks in the dialog box for NPCs with multiple quests available, or for which the player has multiple quests in progress or completed.</div></div><hr />

I think it's an interesting change as well, and it seems very likely that it's targeted at fights that DC people as soon as they start when lots of raidwide buffs start being applied and overwritten. Great news for those of us with less than stellar connections. It'll probably allow them to make more mobile fights as well, since the no longer need to plan around a DC risk.</div></div><hr />

Attempts to buff some of the worst-off specs (Frost DK dps, Frost mage dps, Sub rogues, Ele shamans, Destro locks.) Wondering if the revenge buff will also help Arms. Rupture may make it back to rogue dps cycles (though maybe not; even with chance to crit, the ease of not having to use rupture and the use of all those combo points for DD attacks may still outweigh using rupture). The IA nerf is very reasonable, it gave a significant yet completely encounter dependant advantage to mages while being mediocre or outright useless in others. Poor BM hunters get the short end of the stick (no help in sight for them) and honestly I doubt the buffs will be enough for some of these specs but at least they are trying.<br />
Now we got to hop in the PTR to see what Frozo is selling (is he a clown?). The AH will be rocked by these changes, titansteel and cloth prices will drop fast.</div></div><hr />

No more extra dps with PWS for you during festergut.<br />
<br />
The AH changes seem more like a band aide, since they don't want to mess with the back end right now. Ideally, you would be able to post 1 stack of an item with no limit to how many is in that stack. The buyers then could bid or buyout a portion of the stack. I don't think too many AH sellers would be unhappy if players could buy part of their stack.</div></div><hr />

Also they need to fix the Vote Kick for instances like VH or CoS. IF someone ninja AFKs there is nothing we can do to kick because you get the message &quot; Can't kick player so shortly after combat&quot;. Its not like you can wait a long time between pulls in VH or CoS...</div></div><hr />

You are still 1) Wearing T8? and 2) using rupture? <br />

I wonder if this means that rupture will make it back into the cycles. As a mutilate rogue, the only time i use rupture is when i have to provide my own bleeds, and then it's the cheapest one i can and still get the bleed up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're a tailor who makes the specialty cloths, you know what it means.<br />
<br />
No more flying around dragonblight to make cloth. No more waiting on cooldowns. <br />
<br />
It'll make it easier to level tailoring quickly, and it will make the specialty cloth a lot cheaper. (which is good and bad).<br />
<br />
In theory the money maker will be the glacial bags now, but few people really want them, so it will be an over all loss of profits for tailors.<br />
<br />
P.S.-- if any one finds out what frozen orbs can be traded for, let us know.</div></div><hr />

This is to balance out the fact that the CD on the mats for the bag were removed. In a way its a buff, since normally its 8 days for 2 tailors of the right specialty to make that bag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Locks get buffed some more cause we all know that it was too tough on them to keep up.<br />
Rogues get buffed because clearly the muti buff wasn't enough. I mean hell didnt you just nerf them b/c they rolled everyone on the meters w/o ne skill? Oh no I know...b/c the end game rogues that are only doin 11k dps were not beating everyone by 10% dps like in BC so you decided you better fix that.<br />
<br />
Nice out look for druids. Feral and boomkin are both crapped on more. I guess they are gonna ride the kitty/bear forms out into cata as the last &quot;buff&quot; for ferals. That was major since it allowed me to pick from a green/pink kitty, a white/pink kitty, a purple kitty, and a black/purple kitty...instead of a purple kitty.<br />
<br />
So just remember druids:<br />
<br />
Boomkins= Only spec w/o critting Dots that get boosted by haste<br />
Ferals= Only spec that HAS to be behind the target. I want to punch people in the face when they say &quot;Well don't u want to be behind them neways&quot;...well you do except when your dpsing in high movement fights and you cant use your MAIN atk until u get back behind the boss or when the boss turns to cast crap and you cant use ur MAIN atk or on fights like Thaddius where you can never attain full dps b/c you cant use ur MAIN atk all the time. yea skrew u blizz.</div></div><hr />

It is a welcome change though, and with the big damage increase to Hemorrhage (assuming one is equipped with a dagger, like their supposed to) and the +5% passive dmg buff to SftS, while not raid-capable still, it's one step closer to being raid-capable. :) GJ BLIZZ [no /sarcasm]!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Take an average listed weapon damage of 3,000 and compare the two versions.<br />
<br />
Current version fully talented is 60% weapon damage + 576 with 25% per disease as shadow.<br />
<br />
3000 x .6 = 1800 + 576 = 2376 physical<br />
2376 x .75 = 1782 x 1.23 (10% from black ice + 13% from ebon plaguebringer) = 2192 shadow<br />
2376 + 2192 = 4568 total damage<br />
<br />
New version fully talented is 84% weapon damage + 576 with 12% per disease as shadow.<br />
<br />
3000 x .84 = 2520 + 576 = 3096 physical<br />
3096 x 36 = 1115 x 1.23 = 1371 shadow<br />
3096 + 1371 = 4467 total damage<br />
<br />
So a EW nerf and a SS nerf...nice, just what we needed!</div></div><hr />

It's a tiny buff, since the raid will keep the renewed hope effect even if the priest dies for longer than they would before and also a buff since the renewed hope effect will stop proccing and replacing itself so damn often reducing lag; indeed many of the changes in this patch will help in reducing a lot of useless information and help system performance and this can help a lot with 25man raids particularly against stupid DC wipes against limited attempt bosses. Heck if these changes reduce raid lag significantly, they might as well be the greatest buff in the history of WoW.</div></div><hr />

If you are going to complain about druids as dps then complain about the overly complicated rotations. If you NEED an add on to maximize your rotation then Blizzard should fix that.<br />
<br />
As far as shred, the only place you can't use shred is directly in front of the target. It has ALWAYS worked on the sides of the target. It says behind, but you don't have to be directly behind, you just can't be in front. Oh, and all dps is going to want to be behind the target no matter what anyways if they are melee because expertise soft cap only includes dodge (not block and parry) because they can not dodge attacks from behind. So, this is really a non-issue as all melee suffers greatly when you have highly mobile fights.</div></div><hr />

NO comparison. Even if you hypothetically put out the exact same numbers (which shamans have always been capable of more), shamans don't suffer from the same painful side effects in highly mobile fights and have (quite possibly) the easiest rotation in the entire game as compared to balance druids that have the second hardest (eclipsed only by feral druids).</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they finally figured out that cool downs on crafted materials is a stupid idea in general and scrapped that system to allow for this more player friendly game they have been talking about creating.

Its really not that hard to figure out what &quot;other crafting materials&quot; means. It means Runed Orbs, Crusader Orbs and possibly (although the least likely) Primordial Saronite. If they do make it so that you can exchange Frozen Orbs for Primordial Saronite look to see 50 or more = 1.</div></div><hr />

Frost was UNPLAYABLE for most of this expansion. Then the changes in 3.3 made it borderline playable. With the arcane nerfs and the frost buffs, there is a good chance that frost will actually be raid viable now.

<br />
The Arcane nerf is minimal. Frost was way behind; the gap may no longer be completely embarassing but the spec does not look like it will be viable any day soon. They cannot blanket buff frost damage substantially without affecting pvp badly where the spec is already among the strongest; so unless you see a frost buff that is obviously only usable in pve (long ramp up time for instance) don't expect the spec to become viable.</div></div><hr />

Completely agree, i don't think that the changes will 'cut' it but hopefully there will be more.. same feelings for Subtlety for rogues, it was always my favourite spec and seeing it getting buffed does make me smile but i believe that it needs something more.<br />

If you were smart, you would have realized long ago that the way to make money with mining is by getting a JC to prospect your ore into gems and then cut the gems and then sell the gems. Normally, even if you are paying someone they will normally do this for around 5g. An average quality superior gem still sells for 50-100g and an average quality superior gem sells for 250-300g. Titansteel hasn't been a way to make money for quite some time.</div></div><hr />

The only real change to that is, that now its easier to lvl bsing since this is the only real profession that needs them en mass.<br />

As a Miner/JC/Enchanter/Tailor/Skinner/Leatherworker<br />
<br />
I can say without bias that there is a distinct difference between a gathering profession like mining, and a crafting profession like Jewelcrafting. You see, your major cash flow is supposed to be from the fact that you can mine nodes of ore, including titanium, which sells on my server for near 300g a stack. <br />
<br />
Either way, I've liked every change on this minor patch so far, looking forward to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Locks get buffed some more cause we all know that it was too tough on them to keep up.<br />
Rogues get buffed because clearly the muti buff wasn't enough. I mean hell didnt you just nerf them b/c they rolled everyone on the meters w/o ne skill? Oh no I know...b/c the end game rogues that are only doin 11k dps were not beating everyone by 10% dps like in BC so you decided you better fix that.<br />
<br />
<br />
You do realize that rogues weren't actually BUFFED right?<br />
<br />
They buffed the one spec NO ONE USES FOR PVE. We'll have to wait and see if it's even remotely viable still. <br />
And they seem to want to bring rupture back to our rotation which currently doesn't use rupture. That, again, doesn't mean a DPS upgrade at all. My guess is that most rogues still won't bring rupture back into their rotation anyway. Guess we'll have to wait and see.<br />

But, I (personally) find value in the time I put into my characters and feel rewarded for doing so and the gratification from seeing the benefits from the work and time.<br />
<br />
It seems like Blizzard is so attuned to all the Nub QQ floating around the forums about this or that and they cave in to every little whine...<br />
<br />
Buffs and nerfs are always appropriate as classes and builds are so versatile that this will probably contibue to happen for the long haul (accept for some classes, I will admit seem to have been OP or non viable since vanilla, I won't name any because I don't feel like fireballs to the face from the class fanboys).<br />

<br />
**having to wait 24 days to farm mats will make you appreciate it the crafted item MUCH more**<br />
<br />
Spellweave was one of my main sources of income. Now I don't really see it selling fore more than 20g, esp. since the mats can be obtained from frozen orbs now... really?... /sigh<br />
<br />
Blizzard seems like they're just starting to hand out everything to anyone who wants it on a silver platter without anyone having to actually do anything about it or work for it... because of all the nubs who spend their days QQing the forums instead of actually playing the game and working for what they want.<br />
<br />
Whatever, I guess at this point I'm QQing about those who QQ huh?<br />

l2p blizzard why would we wanna spec frost with incanter's absorption. FAILURE.<br />

quiet a few mages dont spec for this anyway I do cos it sometimes can increase my dps but not alot so i dont see this being too much of nerf although i'll still be speccing for it due to the limit of 5% being removed.

My thoughts exactly, kind of sad it took to page 12 before anyone really took note of this, this is HUGE...finally after all my wonder at why it doesn't crit has been solved.<br />
<br />
This should make for interesting stuffs<br />
<br />
on a side note to the person that asked if rupture will make it's way back into the combat cycle, I hope not, cause that means I have to respec again from a ruptureless evis cycle back to a rupture-used cycle which is annoying....but we shall see<br />

IA got nerfed bigtime, you can't absorb all damage with fire/frost ward and if you use mana shield in PVE you have 150k mana.<br />
Arcane Empowerement was 100% uptime unless you had to move eitherway.<br />
Burning Soul is not an epic buff, we have invisibility for a reason.<br />
Brain Freeze is only a buff with Shatter.<br />
Frostbolt is only for PVP.<br />
<br />
I'd say the frostbolt buff is the only good buff we've had.<br />

<br />
<br />
Why not? It may sound insane now, but the talents missing in the elemental tree probably account for about 20% of his DPS? Means he'll go down from 10k to 8k. Meanwhile, the enhancement shaman is only a high DPS class on fights where little to no target switching or downtime is involved - that means saurfang and festergut atm. On fights like putricide you'll see the glorious 10k the enhance -can- do go down to about 5k. This goes for a lot of fights, having an extra raid spot for a fotm/fight favour class is more than worth the DPS loss on that one elemental shaman.<br />
<br />
I'd have to do some actual number crunching or testing to see if this is actually the case, but it's definitely the first thing that comes to mind with the Unleashed Rage talent change.</div></div><hr />

If I am in a group and the group falls apart then because other people couldn't stay I get penalized for 30 minutes? Sure I can stay in a dungeon, but I've been in a HoR run where we had to wait for 3 different tanks until we had one that actually thought he/she could do it! I think after one person leaves they should get the debuff and you should be given the option of continuing and looking for someone else, or leaving without penalty.<br />
<br />
Also they need to fix the Vote Kick for instances like VH or CoS. IF someone ninja AFKs there is nothing we can do to kick because you get the message &quot; Can't kick player so shortly after combat&quot;. Its not like you can wait a long time between pulls in VH or CoS...<br />

What he said.<br />

I've had this exact issue several times. Occulus, CoS, and old kingdom are the usual culprits. Personally I think the system works fine just like it is except the 15 min wait to kick someone (which has been removed in the next patch so yay for that).

<br />
<br />
Where in there does it say mages got nerfed? Ok we can only proc incanter's absorb off our own absorbs oh no, but the cap on amount of sp gained is gone sounds like a buff to me, but seems like mages will get spikey on dmg they might have to change it back. <br />
<br />
Also the glyph of firebolt went from giving you 5% crit to a bigger % increase in haste. How is that bad? That is a huge upgrade to the glyph not a nerf to it. 2.5 second cast .15= 6% increase to haste. Huge upgrade since most mages have tons of crit already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
You Failed to actually read they said that the exp is being lowered but with the extra honor you gain players won't notice</div></div><hr />

I don't fucking care about that. It's just that frost mages are in a very good place right now PvP wise and I don't think they need any buffs there. Since GC is too dumb to split game mechanics as should happen, any change for PVE's sake has to come at a cost in PVP.<br />
<br />
And quite frankly, fuck PVP if it means PVE gets balanced.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoebe</div><div class="date">2010-03-23, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where exactly?<br />
Frostbolt buffed. Check.<br />
Brain Freeze buffed. Check.<br />
Burning Soul buffed. Check.<br />
Incanter's Absorption buffed. Check.<br />
Arcane Empowerment made an aura. Check.<br />
<br />
Glyph that I've yet to see a single mage using nerfed. Check.<br />
<br />
Yep, mages just got buttraped.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Incanter's Absorption change is like a nerf/buff sandwich, the 5% limit was lifted (buff) but mages can only gain IA when using their own absorbs; Fire Ward, Frost Ward, Ice Barrier, Mana Shield ((instead of PW:S and the like).<br />
<br />
At any rate, I know a lot of mages who don't even put one point into IA, let alone fill it out; really the only fight I noticed a huge increase in sp/dps due to IA off the top of my head is Twins in ToC 10/25.<br />
<br />
As someone else stated, the fireball glyph change is kind of a nerf. 5% crit &gt; .015 casting speed increase. But I think whether or not that is a nerf is entirely subjective.<br />
<br />
The Frostbolt buff is nice, but most only use frost/frostbolt for PvP and frost mages were sitting pretty in regards to PvP before this patch.</div></div><hr />
