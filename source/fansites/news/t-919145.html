New Daily Quests Available<br />
<br />
A large assortment of all-new daily quests and rewards are now available in Hyjal, where players can help the Guardians of Hyjal push back the allies of Ragnaros and establish a forward operating base in the Firelands. In order to partake in the Regrowth and Molten Front daily quests, players must have at least completed up to and including the quest Aessina's Miracle. Once this quest has been completed, players should speak with Matoclaw in the Sanctuary of Malorne to take part in the Regrowth efforts.<br />
<br />
All existing Valor Points in the Currency tab have been converted to Justice Points. Any points above the Justice Point cap will be converted into gold at a rate of 47 silver per point and mailed to characters.<br />

Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Zul'Gurub<br />
<br />
All cauldron buffs are now usable while mounted.<br />

Gladiator Weapons<br />
<br />
Season 10 Conquest Point weapons will only be purchasable once a required minimum sum of Conquest Points has been reached during the current season. For example, Ruthless Gladiator's Pike costs 3400 Conquest Points to purchase. However, players must first earn a total of 11650 Conquest Points during Season 10 before they are able to purchase it.<br />
Season 9 Honor Point weapons will only be purchasable once a required minimum sum of Honor Points has been reached during the current season. For example, Vicious Gladiator's Pike costs 3400 Honor Points to purchase. However, players must first earn a total of 18500 Honor Points during Season 10 before they are able to purchase it.<br />
Once the minimum sum of points required to purchase weapons is reached, all available weapons can be purchased for their listed costs. The point requirement is not reset once a purchase is made.<br />
Weapon tooltips from the vendor will let players know how many more Conquest or Honor Points must be earned in the current season before the item can be purchased.<br />

Coffee With the Devs: Content for the Casual 85<br />
As this is my first Coffe with the Devs, I thought some introductions would be in order. I’m the lead quest designer for World of Warcraft, but many of you may already be familiar with my writing and webcomics under the pen-name Fargo from years past. To all my new and old friends: Hello! I hope to have the opportunity for more chats like this in between cramming our game full of epic experiences capable of melting your frontal lobes with pure liquefied awesome. (It says that on my business card.)<br />
<br />
I’m 85. Now What?<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft has a pretty big footprint: we try to create a world that appeals to casual and hardcore players alike. There’s a whole body of players - be they casual or solo gamers or serious gamers with time constraints - who gravitate toward questing. It’s the most accessible part of the game. Quests move you through cool locations, allow you to play through epic stories, and continually reward you without requiring a lot of practice or commitment. Not everyone has the time to raid, and not everyone wants to; for many players, quests are the whole game. A major thrust of the Cataclysm expansion, obviously, was to recreate much of the world to give players a more consistent, satisfying, epic questing experience as they level up.<br />
<br />
But there’s a problem with level-up questing, and it keeps me up at night. It has an end. When you hit max level, the rewards slow to a trickle. You don’t get a comforting Ding! every couple of hours. You stop learning new abilities. From a solo progression standpoint, your character is in many ways “done,” and you turn your attention to the other parts of the game (like crafting.)<br />
<br />
For many players, the end is just the beginning. We’ve done a lot to provide serious players with ongoing progression in the form of dungeons, raids, and accumulating high-end gear for fighting bosses or PvP. But what about the player who just wants to keep questing?<br />
<br />
Keeping the Rewards Coming<br />
<br />
In the absence of gaining levels, there are still ways to reward players who want to continue questing or playing through quest-like experiences. Here are some things (there may be more) that might encourage players like this to stick around:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Participation in an epic story<br />
A sense of progress<br />
Discovery of something new or unexpected each day<br />
Earning character customization (including cool mounts!)<br />
Earning fun toys<br />
Making your character more powerful<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn’t list gold as a reward, because even though it’s fun to hoard gold, the usual reason you want to do so is for one of the reasons listed above. I also hesitated to add “making your character more powerful” to the list. Even though it’s fun and rewarding, I think it has a limit. It’s mostly relevant only if you’ve got powerful stuff to fight. And if you’re not interested in raids, getting powerful just for the sake of power isn’t always compelling.<br />
<br />
We’ve grappled with this problem before, and we’ll continue to tinker with solutions. The Isle of Quel’Danas provided people with a great sense of progression, at least on a realm-wide level, and it sure felt epic. The Argent Tournament definitely gave players a sense of personal progress, as well as lots of fun toys.<br />
<br />
But for patch 4.2, we really wanted to give players something. Something big!<br />
<br />
Fight for the Firelands!<br />
<br />
The Guardians of Hyjal are getting smart in patch 4.2. They’re not just assaulting the Firelands with hardcore raiding guilds… they’re attacking that place with everything they’ve got. That includes you, solo players! We’ve created a whole zone dedicated to daily questing. There are some 60 new quests in total -- that’s about half a zone’s worth of quest content. While the raiders are concentrating on taking down the likes of Ragnaros, you’ll be securing the rest of his fiery domain.<br />
<br />
There’s also a story here, a chronicle of a vicious, knock-down, drag-out fight that begins in Hyjal and progresses - over the course of weeks - across the mountaintop and then into the Firelands themselves. Along the way, major characters are going to get rocked, you’ll meet (and destroy) a few new villains, and you’ll earn yourself a small heap of nice rewards. The druids are establishing a beachhead in a hostile world, starting with little more than a pile of rocks and ultimately erecting an enormous otherworldly base.<br />
<br />
The progression is personal: you won’t see it happen until you make it happen.<br />
<br />
We want to keep that sense of progression going, not just over the course of weeks but on a daily basis. As you begin to unlock and upgrade your hub in the Firelands, more quests will become available, and you’ll be able to slowly push your way forward every day. Extensive randomization means your quest flow will be a little different one day to the next. You’ll also have choices to make as to how the battle progresses.<br />
<br />
The Firelands daily area hits a lot of the high points on my list above. And, for good measure, players can also earn a lot of gold and player-power enhancing items as well.<br />
<br />
Beyond the Firelands…<br />
<br />
Problem solved? Far from it -- to be clear, we don’t think the Firelands questing arc is &amp;lquot;the answer.&amp;rquot; But I’ll come out and say I think it’s pretty sweet. I’d love to hear your feedback -- it’s been up and running on the Public Test Realm for a couple of weeks now. Personally, I’ve fought my way into the Firelands and I’m nearly ready to select my first major upgrade to the quest hub… do I go with the Druids of the Talon or do I recruit the Shadow Wardens? Decisions, decisions! My choice will impact the next couple weeks of questing.<br />
<br />
Still, we’re building towards something, and we’re constantly watching players to see what works and what doesn’t. I can’t wait to see the Guardians of Hyjal stage their assault on the live servers.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, even as we speak, our Top Men and Women (and I want you to imagine that we’re wearing lab coats) are scheming up ways to push these ideas even farther in future World of Warcraft updates. Players shouldn’t feel like max level is the end of their experience. We want everyone to participate in something epic, no matter what their playstyle.<br />

Price Changes<br />
Anything that costs Valor will cost Justice. Anything that costs Conquest will cost Honor. Nothing else changes. If the piece required an item token before, it will require one after. You'll have to down those bosses and win the tokens to purchase those pieces.

<br />
Justice/Valor Points Conversion/Reset<br />
No, Justice isn't removed. You'd want to spend Valor before 4.2 hits if you're going to convert over the 4k cap. We have a blog post planned that goes into it a bit more we'll be posting this week. <br />
<br />
So... you're going to get JP over the 4k cap?<br />

Itemization and &quot;niche&quot; items<br />
This kind of itemization isn't that unusual, nor is it peculiar to this situation. As others have pointed out, there are slow off-hands available which aren't broadly useful.<br />
<br />
There's enough room in itemization for some flexibility, and that allows us to create niche items like slow off-hands or 1-handed swords with agility on occasion. Of course, if a particular item has a comparatively narrow niche, then it's more likely that fewer of those items will be introduced. Or, perhaps we'll place an item like Stormwake, the Tempest's Reach (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/68128/stormwake-the-tempests-reach/) which potentially appeals to several different classes. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/178984/agi-weapons) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2592852346?page=5#82))<br />
<br />
Itemization in raids and in the Firelands<br />
Upon re-reading, I should have been more clear, no question. What I was getting at is that that there's enough room to itemize for everyone, even if we’re designing items that aren’t 100% efficient. I'll clarify further, though.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, we don't set out to provide perfect itemization for every spec in the game for every tier of content (though we don't want to leave anyone totally out in the cold, either). Sometimes the item a particular class or spec wants is going to be a bit tougher to get. While that’s not an ideal situation and some specs are more prone to the effect than others, it is the kind of thing that is going to happen sometimes - otherwise every desirable weapon would be sitting on the first boss of every dungeon. We like to put weapons on end bosses because they feel exciting. I know some of you are frustrated about where it ended up, but we particularly wanted to put the axe on Nef because he also dropped one in Blackwing Lair.<br />
<br />
We work very hard to keep itemization, including loot tables, from feeling too formulaic. We don’t want shaman to use swords for the same reason we don’t want druids using swords. Itemization would certainly be easier on us if every player could use every weapon in the game, but we also think it would be a lot less interesting. We've done some stat streamlining to make things easier, but we don't want to do so much that every weapon in a tier seems to be the same item with a different model.<br />
<br />
With an eye to the future, we're looking forward to two weapons suitable for Enhancement in Firelands that do not require killing Ragnaros. One of these weapons can drop from multiple bosses, so you can hold out hope that even if the first boss doesn’t drop what you're looking for, the next one might. There are also no agility swords this time around to take up those one-hander slots.<br />
<br />
Finally, some of you may be relieved to hear that the Shatterskull Bonecrusher was fixed to be 2.60 speed some time ago. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/178984/agi-weapons) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2592852346?page=15#284))<br />
<br />
Is there anything to be excited about in Patch 4.2?<br />
I'd say the new daily quest areas are pretty darn exciting. Ditto for the upcoming Firelands raid. They both have that sexy fire theme and introduce quite a bit of new content for players to experience.<br />
<br />
I mean, on the one end, you've the daily quests. There's over 60 of them spread between the Regrowth and the Molten Front, and the hubs are designed to offer as much questing variety as possible (a lot of the quests are randomized, which means you won't get the same ones every day). You also get to unlock new vendors with cool items to buy, watch the world change right before your eyes, and kick some hot Druid of the Flame boo-tay. A lot of the quests are loads of fun to play through, too, so I wouldn't write anything off as &quot;a grind&quot; just yet.<br />
<br />
On the other, you've got the Firelands featuring seven brand new bosses with some epic mechanics and a whole new tier of gear. Currently available raids are also having their overall difficulty reduced, which we hope will open up the content to players who've not yet had the chance to experience it (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2580598159). And if you're a collector, there's a variety of new pets, mounts, and vanity items being introduced with the patch to hunt down and hoard.<br />
<br />
So, while I wouldn't say &quot;there's something for everyone,&quot; because that's a bit of a broad sweep, there's definitely a lot of different things to do -- and, for a large portion of players, that in and of itself is exciting. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/179712/42-really-any-different) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2592648801?page=1#6))<br />
<br />
Patch 4.2 Daily Quests<br />
Over 60 new quests were created for the Regrowth and Molten Front daily questing areas, but they won't all be available at once. Instead, a lot of quests will be randomized into smaller groups. So, while there might be 10 possible quests available from one cluster of NPCs, only 2 to 3 of those quests would be available on any given day. <br />
<br />
[...] You can unlock both sets of dailies -- the Druid of the Talon dailies and the Shadow Warden dailies -- with a little time and effort. After you have both sets unlocked, though, you can only complete one per day.<br />
<br />
While both sets are positively epic (OMGFIRESPIDERS, FLAMEWAKERSPEWPEW), we like the idea of players getting to choose which group of allies they're going to assist each day. It feels strategic, and -- perhaps more on point with your concern -- will help keep your daily quest load to a much more manageable level.<br />
<br />
(Just FYI, once everything is unlocked, you'll be able to pick up 17-18 quests in total from the new daily hubs.) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/179712/42-really-any-different) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2592648801?page=7#124))<br />
<br />
Patch 4.2 Raid Content<br />
Well, quite a lot of people do raid so I don't think that's a fair assessment. You do not appear to have thus far, but with the balance changes in 4.2 I think you should absolutely be able to pug the Cataclysm raids. That's a lot of content you haven't seen yet.

This game is actually more balanced then any other game out there, and there will never be true balance, ever. It is completely, 100%, impossible. The only thing Blizzard can hope for is getting close, and they damn well are. Closer then any other game has ever been at least.</div></div><hr />

You stupid fool, no offence but you've clearly not played Rift. Questing is not only kill x gather y. I mean in wow you got that, and the only ways to level in wow is by quests, bgs are useless unless it's a cta.. and cta is only eye, wsg, ab , av, remember you got many other CTA which even wont work for the low levels. But in rift we got quests, invasion/rift/major rift farming with 20 people++ dungeon, bg. You can't call wow dungeon 2-3 bars each dungeon exp... rift got repatable quests every time you enter the dungeon and much more extra loot.. anyway wrong topic anyway</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please take the time to consider your posts, arcane blast makes up far more than 5% of mage dps, not to mention that arcane is not the only viable spec. To imply that this patch somehow intentionally rockets mages to the top shows a rather shallow view of how changes are made in wow.<br />

If you didn't get one of the conquest (atm, soon to be honor) weapons before 4.2, you must play 2 minutes a day. the honor it takes to get takes 2-3 weeks.</div></div><hr />

That's funny, apart from the first 15 levels I always level my toons up by dungeon farming and I level up a lot faster than most people I know by doing that, I can quite happily speed on ahead of guildies and what not by just doing dungeons and I don't always need heirlooms to do it either, think you might be doing something wrong if you don't think dungeon runs are viable as a leveling method.<br />

<br />
In the absence of gaining levels, there are still ways to reward players who want to continue questing or playing through quest-like experiences. Here are some things (there may be more) that might encourage players like this to stick around:<br />
<br />
Participation in an epic story<br />
A sense of progress<br />
Discovery of something new or unexpected each day<br />
Earning character customization (including cool mounts!)<br />
Earning fun toys<br />
Making your character more powerful<br />
<br />
Lol, epic story? WoW lost all of it in this expansion (all bosses are recicled/retconed besides Al`kir). Plus after Arthas one would hope they would bring some interesting villain, maybe azhara but we end up getting Deathwing...<br />
<br />
Discovery something new... We all know there arent many new things to discover, things as the hidden places that once existed were lost and we all know what would happen if you were caught &quot;exploring&quot; too much.<br />
<br />
The customization part isnt even worth commenting. I mean &quot;cool mounts&quot; is what they consider customization? Where is the costume tab we ask everyday?<br />
<br />
Its amazing that instead of trying harder to fix stuff to stop losing players they rather say &quot;hey, look here, you are doing wrong, let me tell you what to do, dont quit please, stick around!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Taken from http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2880562<br />
<br />
&quot;At the end of the season, Conquest Points will be converted to Honor Points, possibly exceeding the 4,000 point Honor cap&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The next Arena and Rated Battleground season will begin for level-85 players approximately one week after the end of Season 9 and will coincide with the awarding of Season 9 titles and mounts. At that time, any Honor accrued above the 4,000-point cap will be converted into gold at a rate of 35 silver per point&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Forgive me if I don't fall out of my chair with enthusiasm. Half of everything blizzard says is empty promises that gets scrapped before public test realms.<br />
<br />
What might be a good idea is complete fail and screwed up in the current context and perspective of recent implementations.<br />
<br />
I have to agree with you</div></div><hr />

<br />
just wanted to point out :<br />
<br />
<br />
I would say tuesday 21/6 . <br />
<br />
last 2 major patches/expansion we're on a world event and since next world event is mid-summer festival (flamwarden) I suspect that when they'll launch 4.2<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2011-06-08, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You stupid fool, no offence but you've clearly not played Rift. Questing is not only kill x gather y. <br />
<br />
Yes, you're right. It's also gather 10 of magic rocks on the ground, plant down a banner 5 times looking for x item, which you pick up, and kill 10 more of x and y at the same time. Then you have the occasional 'Assassinate x elite and come back for a pat on the head' quest.<br />
<br />
Oh boy! SO different! Absolutely nothing like teetering through the Dragonblight! e_e<br />
<br />
And yes, I have a subscription to Rift. I have two level 50 characters. I've gotten the achievements for finishing the quests in each zone available to Defiants. The questing experience in Rift is, if anything, on-par with WotLK questing but with zero phasing. It it worse off than Cataclysm questing. It is full with enough variety to prevent it from being completely monotonous, but to straight-up level by questing is just outright annoying and would be just as obnoxious to go through if you attempt leveling the number of alts that are typical to WoW.<br />
<br />
I say this because from what I see from a lot of people who scream vehemently that Rift questing is better than questing, they tend to mention that they resent or frown upon the WoW experience of having to level up 5 or 6 alts to keep themselves from boredom. That right there indicates what the problem is -- you've all done the WoW quests so many times, and did nothing BUT straight-up questing, that you're burned out on the same crap you see every day. The moment you're given an identical quest but to kill completely new things with a completely different environment it's like eating an Oreo for the first time in 5 years. The cookie you just ate is no different from what they were like 5 years ago, but you're just thrilled to eat it anyways because you forgot how tasty the cookie was from before you got burnt out from shoving chocolate sugar mush in your mouth over and over.<br />
<br />
The only thing that stands out in Rift in comparison to the WoW experience is the dynamic event system -- the Rifts and Minor/Major invasion events. Even then, the supposed &quot;your actions or lack thereof will impact your surroundings!&quot; that Rift has touted loudly isn't quite at the mark of truely affecting your surroundings or making you feel like you did something of worthwhile. It has certainly played towards the audience of WoW players who enjoyed the Undead Plague event from pre-WotLK, however.... just without the griefing.</div></div><hr />

So unique and always changing. all IMO of course. :)<br />

Right but the blizzard devs are being assholes and not listening to the community that is bad as hell right now, the rift dev is listening to the community.<br />
And yeah if you like me have been playing since tbc you whould know there is nothing interresting about the world any more and all the nostalgia died with cata when they revamped most low lvl zones, but ill give it a little time and you will soon see too how bad it really is, gl with omg dailys! and 7 bosses for the next 3-5 months while us rift players can enjoy content patches every month</div></div><hr />

&quot;The next Arena and Rated Battleground season will begin for level-85 players approximately one week after the end of Season 9 and will coincide with the awarding of Season 9 titles and mounts.

Cataclysm was launched 7 months ago, almost to the day. In that time we have only have one tier of raid content .... in SEVEN MONTHS. Not only that but the only content they have given us in those seven months are the two Zandalari heroics, but all of that is just reused content. Even some of the bosses were re-used.<br />
<br />
I fail to see where our money is being spent to be honest. World of Warcraft alone, just counting subscriptions makes them over billion pounds a year ... a BILLION. And what have we seen in seven months? Two re-used raids .... fantastic work guys.</div></div><hr />

18500 honor points is almost a full set of gear, not being able to get it straight up I can understand, but going from first item you want to last is ridiculous. <br />
All that to push people with shit gear to go and get themselves slain in battlegrounds for hours and hours and hours? until you can get a decent weapon.... and here i thought PVP could not get lower.</div></div><hr />

I'm one of the biggest critics of blizzard but i find it amazing that cata has been out 7 months already. I would agree that wotlk was a poor excuse for an expansion but I think cata has been pretty good. <br />
<br />
The new zones were actually fun to play and never felt like grinding - wrath was horrific for that grinding feeling<br />
The old zones being re-made was really good to, I went back and played them all from the beginning mainly to do loremaster but i was surprised at how fun the zones had become - punch deathwing in the face quest was aparticular favourite - 1000 needles was quite fun too.<br />
Their whole approach to quests has changed - for the better<br />
TB was pretty good - remember WG when wotlk came out? It was hardly playable because of lag etc - TB actually worked<br />
2 new races which are quite popular - no one complained like TBC about ugly or &quot;gay&quot; races<br />
<br />
I could go on but i guess people wouldnt continue reading - I thought cata was definately worth the money, more so than previous expansions</div></div><hr />

Actually the &quot;boss questmobs&quot; in TB are all shared, you don't need to be in the same group anymore to get the objective/loot from them.<br />
They'll do the same in Firelands.</div></div><hr />

Ok, gah to this! People are complaining that the incoming nerfs are caused because Blizzard ARE listening to the playerbase, but obviously the wrong section of it whenever it's a change that that individual doesn't like.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't bad, YOU have just had enough of it. Maybe you should've had a one year break during Wrath instead. At the end of the day, you are spouting assumptions as facts.<br />
<br />
Rift is actually in danger of saturating it's own development. Some of what they have done is incrediably smart. Most of the content they are releasing on a regular basis could've been released months ago, or at launch, but they held it back until they needed it. So tell me, what happens when they run out and start having 5+ month patch cycles? What happens when the make patch 1.8 pointless in 2 months because patch 1.9 renders the effects of it obsolete? It's wasted development resources and content that players end up skipping.<br />
<br />
WoW's content cycle is taking too long, rifts is too quick. Both can very easily self distruct using either of these methods. Let's see what Rift is doing in 5 years time.</div></div><hr />

You stupid fool, no offence but you've clearly not played Rift. Questing is not only kill x gather y. I mean in wow you got that, and the only ways to level in wow is by quests, bgs are useless unless it's a cta.. and cta is only eye, wsg, ab , av, remember you got many other CTA which even wont work for the low levels. But in rift we got quests, invasion/rift/major rift farming with 20 people++ dungeon, bg. You can't call wow dungeon 2-3 bars each dungeon exp... rift got repatable quests every time you enter the dungeon and much more extra loot.. anyway wrong topic anyway<br />
<br />
Yes, it's not only that, it's kill x, gather y and bring it back... lol<br />
<br />
Sorry, but after cata, just gathering professions alread give a ridiculous amount of XP, dungeons also give that too. If you think that only quests do that... and that a higher number of daily quests is better, good for you.</div></div><hr />

(basically everyone will get OP in rift) <br />
Still too early to know for sure though.<br />
dunno how they will do with dungeon scaling. I doubt they will IMO.<br />
<br />
That's why it's a &quot;success&quot; for those ppl... they just want to be OP and Rift gives it to them... maybe for a while to grab subs, maybe no...<br />
<br />
But in the end, being OP with everyone destroying everything just snaping fingers gets boring really fast... and for most of said players, the fun is to be the only one OP, not your oponent... (FotM players).</div></div><hr />

But we really don't need any hate going around about it, I personally don't like the game because it has lackluster PvP; horrible animations and lack of customization in addition to a linear class system.<br />
<br />
People will play the games they want to play, even if there is a &quot;better&quot; game. So stop going around spreading hate about WoW.<br />
<br />
Imagine that each month after cata launch, you got one of the raids + a number of dungeons you did get all at once instead? Welcome to Rift content.<br />
<br />
Patch 4.0, level cap 85, tol barad pvp, arena, etc... few dungeons + their heroics + BoT<br />

they can't be serious can they?<br />
18500 honor points is almost a full set of gear, not being able to get it straight up I can understand, but going from first item you want to last is ridiculous. <br />
All that to push people with shit gear to go and get themselves slain in battlegrounds for hours and hours and hours? until you can get a decent weapon.... and here i thought PVP could not get lower.<br />
<br />
yeah I can't understand this either. Before I quit this game (my poor elemental shaman was nothing more than a free kill in pvp) But I still did arena, got my weapon first and played to get the remaining items. It gave me a fighting chance. I did this on 5 of my lvl85 characters - always weapon first. <br />
<br />
this change seems very strange. I was contemplating returning for firelands and getting back into pvp, but this new system sounds too painful. 18500 honor points! that's a lot!<br />
<br />
I'll wait for patch 4.3 and see how that goes. But the more people stay away from the game the more they will quit the game forever. I'm missing it less and less everyday.</div></div><hr />

That's a trend for ppl that only go for PvP in a game, worse in WoW since it's still a PvE focused game at heart. They come and go really fast.<br />
<br />
But I agree that the system applying to honor weapons is kinda stupid. Altough I can see that they want ppl to go a few more times into T11 raids for 359 weapons, ppl crafting/buying the new 365 BS weapons (or something near that from recipes the new daily area vendors offer) and actually at least farming trash in Firelands since they drop T12 weapons.</div></div><hr />

For example, Vicious Gladiator's Pike costs 3400 Honor Points to purchase. However, players must first earn a total of 18500 Honor Points during Season 10 before they are able to purchase it.<br />
<br />
I'm not too sure what to think of this change. On one hand, I guess it'll mean that people won't be running around with epic PvP weapons the moment they ding 85 by saving honour, and it also means that the new blacksmithing weapons become far more viable to sell as &quot;gear your alt quickly!&quot;-items when people don't have instantaneous epic weapons from PvP as an an alternative. However, it also seems needlessly punishing for players who already have established decked out and just waiting to upgrade. Generally, a 18500 grind just seems quite the overkill. I wonder if they can make the system check retroactively? &quot;If you have PvP gear when the patch goes live, its cost in honour will subtract from the total amount you need to grind to be able to buy S9 weapons&quot;, or something like that.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, just decrease the grind somewhat. 18500 is a tad much. Make it so that you can buy a weapon once you have a 5/5 PvP set instead, or something.</div></div><hr />

Those numbers mean what to you ? The highest numbers come form people from vodka/blood legion/for the horde, those are top 10 in the world.<br />

Well one could deduct that these numbers all come from the very best players in the world, so all of them are top 10 guildies, and that these people who play their chars to perfection very adequately describe the dps disparity currently seen in the game.

This was the point that Rawer touched on, and that was my intention. These guys know their class like no other, and probably in full HC gear. I mean who the hell can do 28K dps as a sub rogue? Boggles my mind TBH.<br />
<br />
But that's not what I'm getting at, its the huge range of DPS (from the best in the world.) You can also argue that these may be the MAX DPS of a particular class. The range of DPS is over 13,000 dps. Infact the same fight the fury warrior hit 37,000 DPS, he was beaten by 3 arcane mages. And yet on a daily basis we see news of more frost DK nerfs.</div></div><hr />

I would agree that wotlk was a poor excuse for an expansion but I think cata has been pretty good. <br />
<br />
The new zones were actually fun to play and never felt like grinding - wrath was horrific for that grinding feeling<br />
The old zones being re-made was really good to, I went back and played them all from the beginning mainly to do loremaster but i was surprised at how fun the zones had become - punch deathwing in the face quest was aparticular favourite - 1000 needles was quite fun too.<br />
Their whole approach to quests has changed - for the better<br />
TB was pretty good - remember WG when wotlk came out? It was hardly playable because of lag etc - TB actually worked<br />
2 new races which are quite popular - no one complained like TBC about ugly or &quot;gay&quot; races<br />
<br />
I could go on but i guess people wouldnt continue reading - I thought cata was definately worth the money, more so than previous expansions<br />
<br />
Are you sure TB is better than WG? TB doesnt work when cata came out too, if you might recall, the defender has an absolute advantage because the offence need 3/3 base to win.<br />
TB is horribly lackluster, tower and siege engines are good for nothing other than stalling the zerg fest. <br />
In WG at least you have a castle to storm with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
there is a difference between a buildup and getting something last.<br />
5x set piece is 3x2200+2x1650=9900 points<br />
<br />
so in order to take the weapon you need to spend 18500-3400= 15100 points , and then grind for it again.<br />
<br />
that's the 5 set pieces, + neck+back+wrist+ring (4x1250=5000)<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but that's almost the whole set.<br />
<br />
People that have gear already, people that have points already, all those don't count towards the 18500.<br />
<br />
You will spend less time getting new weapons than trying to get the old one.<br />
<br />
Not getting weapons as soon as you ding is 1 thing, having to get the whole gear before it is another.</div></div><hr />

I'm rubbish at PvP and cant be bothered to dedicate enough time to get good at it, but in saying that I enjoyed WG alot and actually played it often. Whereas TB I played on the first few days because I was op in pve gear, since then it's just been a big borefest. So yeh I agree WG kept me entertained alot longer than TB did!</div></div><hr />

<br />
7 months to make this patch, 4.1 was supposed to be this patch and being almost recycle content i won't ever consider it been released first<br />
<br />
so 4.2 after 7 months of released game and we get....<br />
<br />
-&gt; 2 recycled dungeons with one boss different (yay....hard work... lol)<br />
<br />
-&gt; improvements on dungeon finder (call to arms and queue favoring your realm first &lt; i never seen this work, always get players from other realms. even testing with guild, asking them to queue and after 1m i queue also and also went to the dungeon with other realms, so....blizz are full of crap)<br />
--&gt; also, the call to arms thing its for a medium programmer with severe testing a 1 day job doing the code for it, so...not impressed<br />
<br />
-&gt; many many many new daily quests, Blizz are so excited, yayyyyyy...oh wait...some of the &quot;new awesome dailys&quot; are simply quests from hyjal transformed in dailys, you will do about 7-9 a day, you will have to complete quests to unlock extra ones being the first 20 emblems of world tree, then you will have 150x2 (aka 2 npcs with 150 each) and finally 125x3 &lt; happy griding, this is the way of blizzard keeping us busy ... lol same quests over and over and over and over for about 2 months and a half<br />
<br />
-&gt; 7 raid boss (the scenery of the raid its simply like Ruby Sanctum, just a little bigger and in the north the entrance to Rag, so its just a random of rocks filled with a random of fire spawning all around, nothing creative, nothing impressive, nothing hard to do and really nothing that make the raid so many months to be release)<br />
<br />
hmm anything else? :s<br />
<br />
the reality its this, even for a casual guild this patch/raid will be to small, 7 raid boss. after 2 months, 3 at very very max they will have clean it and going to hardmodes, prepare for seeing tears all over the place about the content being to little and to easy that even casuals are doing hard modes lololol and they will be right, 7 months to this small patch its not worth the excited videos or blues answers that they make, it appears that they are only doing this game for 8 old kids<br />
<br />
i for one hope that guild wars 2 with his innovated things really make people leave wow for blizz to wake up and start doing the work they supposed to do</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spoilers for any dev who might be reading: It's because PvP is no fun without them, to the point where you're a liability without them or an equivalent weapon.<br />
<br />
Dude 2 weeks after htiting 85 on my rogue had a blue pvp set and heroic weapons. With in the next 3 weeks i had both my epic pvp daggers, and throwing weapon. I'm sorry but what are you saving for? I mean if you want the pvp weapon go grind out some areana wins....If you can't grind out the arena wins to buy the weapon you shouldn't get it just because you afked your way through bgs between launch and now.<br />

I'm not sure what your complaint is here, is it that every class in the game has a spec represented in the top 10 of your list, other than the rogues and ret pally(and there dps is less than 2k off from most of the people who don't benfit from a static fight)......<br />
<br />
I'm sure your just raging on arcane mages because you feel like you work twice as had as an arcane mage and still get beat on meter. Its a patchwerk fight, If arcane,mm hunter, and destro weren't at the top i would say that blizzard was doing something wrong.</div></div><hr />

Ive played many easy games that I find fun. If u look passed all the nerfs u will find that azeroth can be alot of fun. And as i said before. If u don't like something don't do it. It just makes u more angry about the game. Remember, to each his own. maybe u should stop yelling at actual blizz fans about nerfs and choices and either move on or keep playing nd see what happens.(no offense to anyone)<br />

<br />
It's sad when you for health reasons can't reliably raid, even nerfed content, and thus most likely won't be able to get those tokens unless I'm completely misunderstanding something. I have like two friends left in-game that haven't quit due to Cataclysm. They understand my situation. I figured I could run some heroics with them on the days I feel capable and then slowly build up that tier 11 set which I at least like the look of. But I guess not. It's just strange, because when I read all the other stuff that Blizzard is talking about, it seems like they understand the problem with people having and wanting various playstyles, so why keep this token requirement which forces you to raid old content for old gear?<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm sure your just raging on arcane mages because you feel like you work twice as had as an arcane mage and still get beat on meter. Its a patchwerk fight, If arcane,mm hunter, and destro weren't at the top i would say that blizzard was doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
If you toss Arcane out of the meter and use Fury Warriors as the baseline for DPS comparison, everyone below Ret is &gt;10% lower than the highest. Pretty lame how that many specs are that low. Even if you toss out the historically terrible Sub Rogue, Frost Mage, and BM Hunter, you still have several specs performing very poorly. Simulationcraft isn't all that different from the practical results shown there: Certain specs (i.e. feral) are drastically below the mean, let alone the high. Arcane, MM, and Fury are far too high compared to the rest.<br />
<br />
Also, &quot;every class has a spec represented in the top 10&quot; is nonsense. Enhance =/= Elemental, nor do they share the same gear. Feral =/= Balance, nor do they share the same gear. No Rogue spec is in the top 10. ALL THREE lock specs are in the top 10 of those results. These type of results completely undermine everything in GCs post about how &quot;balanced&quot; the game has become. Feral is 23% lower than Fury in the FIRST tier. I doubt it'll be another BC where an entire spec becomes laughable in the second tier, but I can't imagine those Feral druids are too excited with a third straight expansion where the spec is in poor shape right out of the gate. Enhance shamans aren't in much better shape and undoubtedly are just as frustrated this XPac as last time.</div></div><hr />

Deth'tilac<br />
Deth'tilac, a hostile purple spider, is located behind the Forlorn Spire in Firelands. Deth'tilac has the buff Molten Will, making it immune to being tamed unless it's at low health. Easier said than done; Deth'tilac has 38,745,000 health on the PTR and uses Deth Metal which increases movement speed when not attacked and Aura of Deth'spair which reduces healing by 99%. It also uses Deth Strike which kills a player but also reduces maximum health by 10%.</div></div><hr />

I figured I could run some heroics with them on the days I feel capable and then slowly build up that tier 11 set which I at least like the look of. But I guess not. It's just strange, because when I read all the other stuff that Blizzard is talking about, it seems like they understand the problem with people having and wanting various playstyles, so why keep this token requirement which forces you to raid old content for old gear?<br />

Again, leaving an entire game full of other things that you like or could like (since you said you enjoyed 4.2 stuff) because of a old tier token? Everyone have their own limitations/problems. Doesn't mean you should just give up.<br />
<br />
Even if it's for the looks of it, it won't go away and will get easier and easier to get it to the point where you would be pissed to waste points on it instead.<br />

<br />
<br />
Doesn't really boggle mine.<br />
<br />
Sub scales ridiculously with gear. A sub rogue with full 372 gear on a completely stationary target on a fight that probably only lasts them a minute or two with all the geared players (The sooner the boss dies the higher the dps). Add every single person that can provide a temporary dps buff to the sub rogue (tricks, hysteria, etc) and yes, 28k dps is VERY achievable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A patchwerk fight, melees would be hitting the boss from behind always... Unless it's only on my server that ppl play the strat where there is always a group not hitting the boss from behind, it's expected that ranged dps is ahead of melee on him.<br />
<br />
With that said, some classes/specs get screwed more than others for not doing it from behind, adding parries/blocks to their table. Looks like the only melee class/spec who can stand such positioning while still doing highest dps are Fury Warriors (and as ppl alread said, they know when to use their Bursts/CDs instead of using them when getting parried). Feral DPS as expected is the lowest for the high dependency on having to hit the mob from behind. As is the Rogues who loose dmg that way too. They would not be there on other bosses. The same way Frost DKs are a little better than Ret Paladins thanks to using some spells instead of melee hits. Actually I would expect Ret paladins be worse than that since everytime you get a CS parried, you don't get a Holy Power charge and CS goes on CD, but looks like their burst and correct use of CDs bring it closer to others.<br />
<br />
There are many things to take into account on that kind of boss, so, no, it's not that useful as a tool to measure class/spec dps balance.</div></div><hr />

nah, it's because it's an undead boss= 100% crit on exorcism. taking that in mind, a normal boss would screw rets even more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My memory is starting to fail me regarding specific statements, but I somewhat recall that Blizzard never wanted the PvP weapons to be considered &quot;required&quot; for PvE advancement. Since Arena was first put into the game, the weapons have almost always been quicker (unless you just have ungodly luck with the RNG) to obtain for many people, and given how much is now scaled on weapon damage and primary stat for melee classes (lesser benefit but it's still there for casters), the arena weapons are pretty choice.<br />
<br />
They've tried several things in the past to try to limit it, but it still is happening... so hey, we get another attempt. If you play PvE mainly, do that for your weapons or be prepared to invest more than the current amount of trivial time getting the PvP ones. For those that PvP anyway mostly, this change really isn't going to affect things because everyone is starting over re: conquest weapons. Honor weapons w/e, now a tier or more below.<br />
<br />
The only people it's really going to impact negatively is the people who do both, because they will probably fall behind the dedicated PvP'ers faster than in current content... that said, that isn't a bad design goal regardless, and is just like PvE advancement.<br />
<br />
Overall I think it's a good change from a game perspective, of course in the spirit of full disclosure, I PvP once in a blue moon (and promptly get my ass handed to me as a result), so this change impacts me not at all. YMMV.</div></div><hr />

Patch 4.2 sounds nice that you open up things by questing. But I don't think that is as rewarding as building up my own empire. So for example there is initially an empty wilderness. Then you go there and do things and that way you gain areas of a map colored with your color. This map could be done in huge amount of different kinds of ways. But simplistically the point is to grow your own empire, not just go kill a Lich King because he is bad, go kill a Dragon because he is bad, go kill a Demon because he is bad. I don't care about Lich King, Dragon, nor Demon. If they get into the way of my empire, then yes, they will step down or die. But the model where you go killing baddies for your king feels soooo yesterday.<br />
<br />
I want to decide what kind of my empire will be. If I want to build into mountains, then I will build into mountains. If I want forests, then I build into forests.<br />
<br />
There can be a myriad of ways of building the empire what comes to game mechanisms. Again simplistically it can be a page where it says that you have 1 piece of forest land and a house there. Or you could use a portal to random forest and kill mobs defending your house. Or there could be a map that gets colored when you acquire more land. Or there could be instances of random dungeons where you go to clear mobs with your friends (can't get castle without doing group missions). And so on.<br />
<br />
There could still be dungeons and raids like always has been, but I want to see somewhere that my empire is growing because I did this and that. But now it is more like yes you get the achievs, but then there is just a gear reset and off you go getting couple of more levels, and start everything over again.</div></div><hr />

These guys know their class like no other, and probably in full HC gear. I mean who the hell can do 28K dps as a sub rogue? Boggles my mind TBH.<br />
<br />
But that's not what I'm getting at, its the huge range of DPS (from the best in the world.) You can also argue that these may be the MAX DPS of a particular class. The range of DPS is over 13,000 dps. Infact the same fight the fury warrior hit 37,000 DPS, he was beaten by 3 arcane mages. And yet on a daily basis we see news of more frost DK nerfs.<br />
<br />
Few things. First I don't think those numbers include the 5% arcane blast buff which will end up being nearly a 5% nerf off the top as 90 to 95% of damage comes directly from AB. That will put arcane right in line with the next 2-3. Given that Arcane has poor movement, they have to have better standing damage to make up for the loss on most raid fights. Cata so far has very few non-movement fights. <br />
<br />
2nd, they aren't nerfing DK because of PVE, so stop making that correlation. It's all about PvP. Here, let me break it down for you...<br />
<br />
* Might of the Frozen Wastes now increases two-handed weapon damage by 3/7/10%, down from 4/8/12%.<br />
<br />
Notice how that even though DW frost is sligthly better, it's the 2h talent that got nerfed? That's because 2h is what most people pvp with. More...<br />
<br />
* Glyph of Dark Succor has been redesigned. Rather than placing a 15% maximum health floor on Death Strike healing while in Frost or Unholy Presence, it causes the next Death Strike within 15 seconds after killing a foe that yields experience or Honor Points to heal for at least 20% of the death knight's maximum health (still requires Frost or Unholy Presence).<br />
<br />
Another PvP nerf.<br />
<br />
* Killing Machine now procs from autoattacks instead of melee attacks. (Tooltip clarification, already like that on live) <br />
<br />
Depending on the proc rate (something they didn't disclose) this could be a PvE nerf or buff. But it's definitely a PvP nerf since you are more likely to hit with Yellow attacks than White.<br />
<br />
* Hungering Cold now has 1.5 sec cast time, up from instant.<br />
<br />
PvP clearly.<br />
<br />
* Howling Blast has been reduced by approxomately 8-9%.<br />
* Obliterate has been reduced from 160% to 150% base weapon damage.<br />
* Annihilation now increases damage dealt by Obliterate by 15/30/45%, up from 12/24/36%.<br />
<br />
These three I put together. <br />
<br />
Obliterate gets a 9% buff plus a nerf that is harder to figure. It's 160%WD + 1500 * 1.60 (diseases) versus 150%WD + 1500 * 1.60. But I'm guessing it's somewhere under 5%. Since HB is generally lower on the total damage done than Obliterate, I'm going to say it's pretty much a wash for overall damage in PvE except on AoE fights. BUT, it nerfs PvP again because HB is ranged versus Obliterate which is melee only. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm sure I missed something, feel free to correct me.</div></div><hr />
