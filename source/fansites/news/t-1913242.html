Holy, Restoration, and Protection have been shared forever, and describe the specs. Combat was changed to Outlaw because it didn't. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/671811239949955073))<br />

Artifact Weapons<br />

why would people serious about pvp reset their level for prestige and then re-level? They would lose pvp effectiveness, right?<br />
Prestige is an optional form of progression with its own rewards. There is a related cost, and some players may choose not to do it. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/671810049447096320))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Why did the RTS genre die?<br />
I have a lot of thoughts here, but I want to caveat that this is mostly anecdotal and not backed up by data.<br />
<br />
First, and probably most importantly, I think Warcraft 3 started a trend that continued with the MOBAs to focus on micromanagement of a single hero rather than micromanagement of an entire economy. A lot of players clearly found the single-character-focus satisfying. RTS games became MOBAs the same way dinosaurs became birds.<br />
<br />
Second, back in the RTS heydey, I felt like there were a lot of large games being played on LANs in offices and colleges. Perhaps due to esports, but certainly due to Starcraft 2, the focus drifted more to one-on-one games. Age of Empires was at its best in 3v3 or 4v4, which lent itself well to a lot of casual multiplayer<br />
<br />
Third, it used to be more possible to compete in an RTS as a strategic player who made smart decisions and not just a twitch player with good reflexes. To be pro, you need to be good at both, but it's hard to even have much fun these days if you're bad at micro.<br />
<br />
Fourth, back in the RTS heydey, you might meet someone, find out they play the same RTS as you, and agree to play together sometime. In later years, you'd quickly realize you were radically different ELOs and just say &quot;Oh.&quot; To be fair, this happens in MOBAs as well, but the 5v5 nature helps a little there.<br />
<br />
Fifth, I think over time the games just lived out their lifespan. There was such a leap in complexity of everything -- strategies, unit design, counter units, systems -- that it was difficult for anyone but pretty hardcore players to keep up. Yet, if they hadn't keep adding those systems, the engaged players might have gotten bored. I keep hoping that it feels like it's time for RTS as a genre to come back. Not yet.<br />
<br />
Finally, I think it is easier to consume the content in an RTS. The developers can try to throw interesting maps or cool hooks at you in single-player, but you're going to see all of the units and buildings pretty quickly in multiplayer. MMOs can continually offer you new things to explore and enemies to fight. MOBAs add new champions. An RTS had to wait for a massive expansion, that in turn added to the bloat I mentioned in #5. <br />
<br />
I miss the storytelling of RTS campaigns. RPGs dont do the big stories as well imo<br />
On WoW, I occasionally wished for Warcraft 4, just because it would give us such fertile ground for new stories. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/668966265382309890))<br />
<br />
So you agree that RTS died? so sc2 confirmed daed gaem?<br />
It's more that 10 years ago there were like 20 RTS franchises. Now there are a couple. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/668966398115184641))<br />
Maybe &quot;dead&quot; is too strong (and that came from the questioner). But the RTS field is much smaller than when I first got into it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/668966929365778436))<br />
<br />
interesting thoughts - what do you think would have happened if MOBAS were introduced prior to RTS?<br />
I do think RTS delivers a particular experience (you're the commander) in a way few other genres can do well. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/668967364843573248))<br />
4X games make you feel like a leader, but the battlefield is much more shallow IMO. (The rest of the experience is deeper though) (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/668967497119346688))<br />
So maybe RTS would have doubled down on that aspect -- less about the hero on the field and more about the soldiers. Shrug. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/668967622248009728))<br />
<br />
Isn't the ideal MMO where all content is always relevant in some way and new content is icing on the cake?<br />
IDK. Some sense of progression is nice too. I don't need to be running Keep on the Borderlands when I am 20th level. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/669638956066017280))<br />

As far as non mythic raiding this is spot on. Tank DPS and mitigation are not a huge deal. I would say this is a bad thing, but that is my personal opinion and depending on who you ask your mileage may vary. For hard core mythic raiders I would assume everything matters.<br />
<br />
Personally I would like to see the dps loss from not doing the &quot;optimal&quot; rotation to be marginal, and instead give the dps more things to do such as debuff or cc adds, activate switches or other mechanics, and avoid more things. Someone who gets paid to think of these things could likely come up with more interesting things than I just mentioned. Currently a dps has 2 real jobs: Maintain best uptime on the boss/adds and maintain best dps order on boss/adds. Are there any debuffs a class brings that benefit another class anymore?<br />
<br />
I dunno. I just do not feel the dps job is dynamic enough for me to want to do it.</div></div><hr />

Not sure why we can't have a few bosses where their really isn't an enrage timer so dps doesn't matter but we require the dps to do something other than dps or it won't work. Dispell or debuff or something or than stay out of the fire. I kinda miss the dynamics of a dpser having to tank something like gruuls lair. Maybe not every boss but one here and there. In this day and age why can't we have a boss out on a platform that melee tank can't tank and have a mage or lock or hunter or etc &quot;tank&quot; it. And everyone else switches to dps mode except healers and do something else... heh</div></div><hr />

Well, thats a bit disappointing... It would be better, in my opinion, to have a limited &quot;points&quot; to choose from. Kinda like the old talent system. That way, if the talents were well balanced, we could have more diversity between players.</div></div><hr />

Imho, DPS job should be doing damage, Healers job should be doing healing, and Tanks job should be doing selfabsorb - it's kind of countable reduction. Maybe change for tanks so 50% of damage done is converted into selfabsorb. That would solve ridiculous tanks' dps too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No more lame or lazy than &quot;original&quot; myths featuring the Norse characters borrowing\adapting\renaming characters from the myths of earlier civilizations. Storytellers have been doing the same thing for millenia. Romans, Greeks, Babylonians, Sumerians... all are rampant plagiarizers. It helps the audience understand whatever variation the storyteller makes because the audience can fill in the context with minimal help. Is Marvel lame for featuring Thor and Loki prominently in their comics?</div></div><hr />

Hey they mostly change/add at least two letters! Thorim, Loken, Freya, Mimiron.. AND a few times it's the Egyptian gods Isiset, Ammunae, Rajh. But no, in general it's no less or more lame than the countless other references Blizz makes in their games. Certainly not 'incredibly.'</div></div><hr />

Same process with Egyptian mythology in Uldum.<br />
If we go deeper, there are many notions from Christianism that are simply imported into the game, even tho i'm pretty sure no Warcraft character has ever heard about that Jesus guy.<br />
<br />
I think those references to our real world are cool. Makes a link between IG and IRL environments.</div></div><hr />

So the warrior class hall which everyone is raving about, shares art assets with a beginner dungeon that no one will remember. so much for being special.<br />
<br />
At least it's better than the sewers. There thar be rats. And vermin. :cool:</div></div><hr />

Outside of quest reward items, you'll want to wait until the transmog system is available in-game before you delete any gear. <br />
<br />
Fuck! I have been deleting gear thinking that... ugh....</div></div><hr />

It'll be back! I'll bet they just wanted to give the server team a break for the holidays while the dev team brings new features online. They've got enough on their plates now with the the WoW Alpha &amp; eventual Beta coming online this month.<br />
<br />
Granted... a little OW would be a nice escape from family over the holidays but... :-)</div></div><hr />

Exactly how I felt. The whole place looks cool, but very unoriginal in terms of occupants.<br />

Thorim and Freya didn't seem to bother anyone in Ulduar... :p<br />

So do I, now THAT was a great RTS series :(<br />
<br />
While I think GC's overstayed its welcome, he's pretty much right about the RTS genre. Maybe its not ''dead'', but there sure as hell is a lot less of them than 10 years ago. And I don't see that genre rising anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

3.. Mimiron is also a reference to norse Mythology no wait 4 because Hodir.<br />
<br />
I am really big into mythology so the more references to greek,norse and egyptian mythology the better.</div></div><hr />

You probably are the only one, unless you think Marvel, age of empires and everything else who adapted norse mythology to be lame as well.<br />
<br />

Well, we had a WHOLE zone in uldum and no one complained too.</div></div><hr />

Oh, come on. Marvel and Age of Mythology take place on Earth and so make direct references to Earth history and mythology. Warcraft is supposed to take place in an alien universe.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with general unoriginality of the Pantheon characters -- most mythologies share recurring themes and archetypes. But Blizzard can't even be bothered to think up original names for them.</div></div><hr />

It's unnecessary and actually unhelpful. We're meant to recognize them immediately because it conveys a lot of other information that doesnt have to be spelled out if we don't.</div></div><hr />
