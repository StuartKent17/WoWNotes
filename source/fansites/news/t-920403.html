Patch 4.2 - PTR Build 14265 Tagged as Release<br />
If you spend time on test realms you might have noticed that the latest PTR build is tagged as &quot;Release&quot;. It means it's time to stockpile the gummy bears and get ready for the Firelands, the patch will definitely hit the live servers soon. (Most likely June 21st (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2331-PvP-Season-9-Ending-Soon))<br />

Arena Season 10 Weapons - Models Preview<br />
With the recent announcement of how Season 10 weapons will work in Season 10, it's time for a preview of the weapon models! For the stats, feel free to check the two links below.<br />
<br />

<br />
Player vs. Player<br />
Gladiator Weapons<br />
<br />
Season 10 Conquest Point weapons will only be purchasable once a required minimum sum of Conquest Points has been reached during the current season. For example, Ruthless Gladiator's Pike costs 3400 Conquest Points to purchase. However, players must first earn a total of 11650 Conquest Points during Season 10 before they are able to purchase it.<br />
Season 9 Honor Point weapons will only be purchasable once a required minimum sum of Honor Points has been reached during the current season. For example, Vicious Gladiator's Pike costs 3400 Honor Points to purchase. However, players must first earn a total of 18500 Honor Points during Season 10 before they are able to purchase it.<br />
Once the minimum sum of points required to purchase weapons is reached, all available weapons can be purchased for their listed costs. The point requirement is not reset once a purchase is made.<br />
Weapon tooltips from the vendor will let players know how many more Conquest or Honor Points must be earned in the current season before the item can be purchased.<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Adding more PvP content<br />
We've actually touched on this topic in the past. In general, while we could add more Battlegrounds and Arenas we risk thinning out the queue for all Battlegrounds and Arenas. We're not against the idea of adding more, but it's a matter of deciding the how and the when of doing so.<br />
<br />
We could compare the content between PvP and PvE, but it's not exactly an equal comparison given that the styles of play are different as are the end goals.<br />
<br />
Just as an FYI, we are putting the Ring of Valor back in again in 4.2, which (while not new) will at least add back in a bit more variety to Arena queue.<br />
<br />
Also of note, we are implementing a new War Games interface (which you can see on the PTR) which should make it easier for people to play skirmish type matches against people either in the Battlegrounds or Arenas. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/180135/why-no-new-battle-grounds-or-even-arena) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2649966140?page=1#6))<br />
<br />
War Games<br />
We've actually had the War Games in since last December. The only issue was that it required that you knew it existed and used the right game commands to get it rolling. We've now shined it up and added a great new easy to use interface into the patch so that you can start challenging other groups. Just keep in mind, there's no rewards available (including HKs) for taking part in these, but they can be very fun. It's also a great way to hold your own in-game event if you wanted. (Remember when people would meet up at Gurubashi?) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/180135/why-no-new-battle-grounds-or-even-arena) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2649966140?page=2#29))<br />
<br />
Feedback and changes to the community<br />
No, I don't. I just think that people have concerns (of which we're aware of) and we're doing what we can to address what we can as we go.<br />
<br />
As for having someone else speak, we've been talking and will continue to talk. Just recently Dave Kosak gave some insight on the new quest hubs. (On the blog.) Greg Street continues to share his own insights there as well. No matter your personal thoughts or feelings about what they have to say, they care deeply for the game and community.<br />
<br />
While some may have concerns over whether their questions in the Q&amp;As are being answered or not, we are talking there as well. We're here in the forums responding to what we can.<br />
<br />
It's true we don't have infinite resources and that's been true since day one of World of Warcraft. That hasn't changed. I see it come up time and time again that the &quot;good&quot; devs have moved to the new project, but that too isn't true in the way people think it is and is insulting and dismissive to the guys (and gals) who have been on the team for years. The people working on World of Warcraft are people who have been here for years or are still being guided by those who have been here for years. The people who &quot;left&quot; WoW haven't really left either. They are here at the studio lending their ears and thoughts to those still working on World of Warcraft. They haven't washed their hands of the game and the company hasn't washed their hands either.<br />
<br />
We know we aren't always going to agree on a direction. We know we can make mistakes or not anticipate every possible outcome, but there is no way I'm going to tell you that we don't care, or that the developers don't care or that we are insular from the concerns being voiced.<br />
<br />
We are and continue to be passionate about the game and about the community. We're never going to give everyone their perfect answer, but that isn't going to stop us from trying to meet and exceed expectations where we can. We aren't beat or beaten but can understand how easy it is to buy into that idea with so many people repeating the thought. Sometimes it's hard to be positive when you only see the negative, but the positive is still there and we refuse to lay down and go with the negative flow of thought. As any game &quot;ages&quot; it is so easy to forget the good and the &quot;polish&quot; and start picking at what you see as flaws. It's also easy to take for granted all the things that are added in because they make so much sense. Eventually you forget that it was ever new to begin with because it feels like it was always there.<br />
<br />
Again, we're totally open to constructive feedback. We're not deaf to it. We just may not react immediately or have the answer you want. It's just not always possible to. That doesn't mean we didn't hear it or think about it on one level or another and it doesn't mean that we are going to suddenly stop listening because we don't like what someone has to say. We're just asking that the dialogue stay open, honest, and most importantly constructive. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/180177/is-blizzard-done-with-wow) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2649966340?page=4#63))<br />
<br />
&quot;Grindy&quot; leveling and improving old content<br />
While I wouldn't say that leveling from 1-79 is totally &quot;grindy&quot; (I actually had and continue to have a lot of fun running through those zones), I can definitely see your argument. I mean, a lot of current dungeon mechanics are fun, right? They make you analyze the world around you and adapt changing scenarios, sort of like a puzzle. At first glance, having that kind of gameplay accompany you all the way from lower level quest zones to end-game dungeon content seems like it'd be amazing. But that's just at first glance. There's a lot to be said for keeping the leveling process as seamless and straightforward as possible.<br />
<br />
For a lot of players, the goal of World of Warcraft is to meet some benchmark, things like leveling up, getting gear, increasing their character's potency, and/or defeating end-game raid content. While questing may be enjoyable activity in its own right for some (like you!), there's definitely a portion of the population where it's really more of a means to end -- a way of achieving those other goals more quickly or with greater efficiency -- and that's an important fact for us to keep in mind.<br />
<br />
It's not that quests aren't important; on the contrary, they're a critical part of the game, and we'll continue to work towards making them even more epic and fun. It's just that if we make quests too challenging or too complicated, especially during the leveling process, we run the risk of creating situations where players might become frustrated and feel like they're being forced into a style of gameplay that isn't exactly their cup of PvE.<br />
<br />
Now, that doesn't mean there isn't some sort of balance that can be struck, where we're able to create quests that evoke the fun of dungeon encounters, but never really reach that point where they become tedious or difficult (we totally hear your feedback on that). It's a matter of appealing to as many players as possible and making sure that they're engaged, but not overwhelmed with over-the-top challenge as they level up -- which can be tricky, especially when you have such a wide variety of playstyles and opinions to consider.<br />
<br />
Even so, incorporating more dynamic mechanics into questing and using quests as a teaching method is something we'd like to do for future content. Whether or not we should invest the time and resources into revamping existing content, though...well, that's something that we'd have to weigh very carefully, as it would require us to focus our attention away from creating new things. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/180201/leveling-needs-more-thought) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2649816039?page=1#20))<br />

Poison Management<br />
If I've forgotten to buy enough poisons to see me through a raid or dungeon, or failed to pay attention to poison durations and seize the occasional moment to re-apply my poisons, then those are issues I can easily resolve by being slightly more mindful.<br />
<br />
At worst, glyphed poisons apply very quickly, and it's possible to re-apply them in a non-clutch fight if you have them in your bags. It's not even close to ideal, but it's possible. <br />
<br />
Why does it make sense for Hunters to no longer have physical ammunition for their bows and guns it's just MYSTERIOUSLY provided to them but Rogues' poisons must be bought from a specific vendor and then applied to weapons once an hour?<br />
Well, maybe I can shed some light on the mystery then, or at least, our thought process.<br />
<br />
Poisons are important to the rogue class and there's no doubt of that. There's still little or no comparison to be made between the use of poison (which amounts to an important buff) vs. ammunition, without which the hunter class was almost totally ineffective. Running out of poisons means a performance hit, but it doesn't mean that performance stops. Running out of ammo meant that a hunter could no longer use most class abilities or perform at anything resembling a meaningful level. It's relatively easy to remain well stocked with a selection of poisons. It required slot after slot of inventory filled to the brim with ammo to keep a hunter running consistently.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, ammunition wasn't a mechanic that we felt was particularly interesting. Whereas a rogue sometimes has interesting choices to make regarding which poisons to use, the only real choice a hunter had was to use slightly more or less expensive ammo, which wasn't much of a choice at all.

You know, that other system of deciding between physical damage, magic damage, and a slow between each of your weapons? The one that doesn't need an otherwise-useless vendor? The one that's baked right in to the class and is learned at the trainer, making it useable right when you buy it and forever after without running around Orgrimmar?<br />
<br />
Buying things to necessary for your class from another player (flasks, food) is an economy. Buying things necessary for your class from an NPC (reagents, poisons) is an inconsistent, class-specific moneysink. You got rid of the ammunition. We can glyph out the reagents. You're so close to getting this right, Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

do we really want to see them? bearing in mind there hasn't been decent looking gear since S3 :D<br />

I see it come up time and time again that the &quot;good&quot; devs have moved to the new project, but that too isn't true in the way people think it is and is insulting and dismissive to the guys (and gals) who have been on the team for years. The people working on World of Warcraft are people who have been here for years or are still being guided by those who have been here for years. The people who &quot;left&quot; WoW haven't really left either. They are here at the studio lending their ears and thoughts to those still working on World of Warcraft. They haven't washed their hands of the game and the company hasn't washed their hands either. <br />

We've actually touched on this topic in the past. In general, while we could add more Battlegrounds and Arenas we risk thinning out the queue for all Battlegrounds and Arenas. We're not against the idea of adding more, but it's a matter of deciding the how and the when of doing so.<br />
<br />
...How in the hell does adding more arena maps thin out the Arena queues when they are chosen absolutely randomly?<br />
<br />
And how long would it honestly take to generate one new arena map for this expansion when entire raids, zones and the like have been made?<br />
<br />
You could just carbon copy Nagrand but put in a different configuration of pillars and it would at least give us variety.</div></div><hr />

Math is hard, for example you have 4 BG's and 100k people that's 25k people per BG, add 4 more BG's now all the sudden you have 12.5k people per BG. Point is it does exactly what he states thins out the potential number of People in the Queues which will in turn affect queue times.<br />
Doesn't matter if it's chosen at random there's still a certain total amount of people queuing for each BG, the more BG's you add the lower that total amount of players per BG is. (Same point for arenas)</div></div><hr />

It's a PvE game first and foremost, which should be obvious with every patch, which are almost exclusively PvE oriented (content wise) and PvP balance changes. Once every bazillion years you maybe get a new arena/battleground added through a patch, but that's it - and of course new PvP tier with every PvE tier increase but that is a must not a choice :D.</div></div><hr />

The end of Wrath - the one boss crap dungeon we got that i can't even remember the name of was 13 months, cataclysm - 4.1 was maybe 4 months and 4.1 - 4.2 is 2-3 months seems like shorter patch time to me.<br />
The amount of content is a whole separate story, Whats to little for you might be just enough for someone else.<br />

What they want to do is give you the same amount but in a shorter time period just like Rift, Yes rift does this faster but some of it is utter garbage.<br />

You seem to misunderstand how the arena queue system works. <br />
<br />
...for example you have 4 BG's and 100k people that's 25k people per BG, add 4 more BG's now all the sudden you have 12.5k people per BG. [...] (Same point for arenas)<br />
When you join the arena queue, you are placed into a pool of potential candidates for the matchmaking system. <br />
<br />
As soon as the matchmaking system finds rating-appropriate opponents, it matches them and puts them into the Arena.<br />
<br />
&quot;the Arena&quot; has no map identity until the participants are decided.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how anyone could think that about leveling.. They have added soo many new quest to leveling and many of them are fun and involve vehicals and other means of doing thats that keep it from feeling &quot;grindy&quot;. The only time I would think leveling gets a &quot;Grindy&quot; feel is from about 58-68 in outlands. But the good thing about outlands is you can pick up like 8+ quests at a time and go out and just do them all unlike in cata i feel you get like 1-2 quests at a time.</div></div><hr />

Dude it's been almost 7 months without new raid content, I don't call that fast - sorry, I'm bored as fuck. To begin with Cataclysm had virtually no end-game aside for the 2 raid instances (one with 4 bosses + 1 heroic only and one with 6 bosses) and 1 joke raid instance and the content now is stale as stale piss could get.</div></div><hr />

To think that arenas are just like that... it's not supposed to have arenas everywhere, everyplace, it's more like an underground stuff (it's from neutral goblins afterall).<br />
<br />
Same for BGs, they're supposed to be places where alliance and horde are in conflict fighting for some kind of big resource/advantage. But there could be more of them since it's kinda hard to think that only the few we have are the only places worth fighting for...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiro</div><div class="date">2011-06-10, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's true we don't have infinite resources and that's been true since day one of World of Warcraft. That hasn't changed. I see it come up time and time again that the &quot;good&quot; devs have moved to the new project, but that too isn't true in the way people think it is and is insulting and dismissive to the guys (and gals) who have been on the team for years. The people working on World of Warcraft are people who have been here for years or are still being guided by those who have been here for years. The people who &quot;left&quot; WoW haven't really left either. They are here at the studio lending their ears and thoughts to those still working on World of Warcraft. They haven't washed their hands of the game and the company hasn't washed their hands either.<br />
<br />
We know we aren't always going to agree on a direction. We know we can make mistakes or not anticipate every possible outcome, but there is no way I'm going to tell you that we don't care, or that the developers don't care or that we are insular from the concerns being voiced.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, now they're begging for sympathy here, and trying to point fingers in other directions away from themselves. Blizzard really plummeted in my respect levels over the past 2-3 years. Point the fingers at yourself. There's a reason people have been jumping ship, or upset voicing their &quot;opinion&quot; or &quot;take on the game&quot;. There's no disputing that content has been lack luster, slow to launch, that it's been small in quantity, that's the recycling has been getting out of control, that money is their main focus, and that they're ignoring their community. They ruined this expansion early on. They were money hungry trying to get new players to the game by repackaging it, making vanilla as EZ-mode as the later territories. Instead they should have put their resources into vastly more end-game content, or to speed up development of the patches. They didn't do it for vets to go through it on numerous alts, they did it because they thought the vets wouldn't leave, and that they'd have a shot at getting more people.<br />
<br />
Businesses like money, sure. But when they fall until Kotick's iron fist, quality drops, and the milking becomes frantic. Their folly with Cata, putting focus on the old world 1-60, slow-weak-recycled content patches, recycled and weak art, and $$$$ pets and mounts goes to show which way these guys are going. And then blizzard wonders why people are leaving or are mad. They're not the blizzard of old. I don't care if the new devs are upset that people are calling them scrubs, because when blizzard says their vets have moved on full-time to new projects, and the quality of life in the game has plummeted in nearly all areas, what do they think people are going to think? That it's the vets leaving and the new devs.<br />
<br />
I know you read these outside media outlets, so I hope you take this all in. Quit playing the sympathy card, man up and take the blame as it's YOUR FAULT, live up to your promises that you still didn't deliver on, step up your game, and listen to your community like you used to while stop dodging real burning questions that call out your follies. Deleting threads, and ignoring hard questions is not going to win your old fans back, nor get new ones at that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously? I'd say billions of dollars a year is ample appreciation.<br />
<br />
4.1 and 4.2 combined = 2 recycled dungeons, a 7-boss raid tier, and a 2-month grindfest daily hub completely lacking unique/new quests. If that isn't a legit reason to complain, what is?<br />
<br />
Seriously, what would it take for the fanboys to admit that the content is lacking? 10 months between raids? A 4-boss tier? How about when they (you know it's coming) recycle AQ as well? What if they cancel WotA like they did Abyssal Maw, and go straight to Deathwing for the third/final raid? Will they finally admit that the complaints are legit then? I'm betting not. I'm betting we'll continue to see arguments exactly like this.</div></div><hr />

I'm still enjoying this raid tier. We are 12/13 and working on Heroic AC at the moment. The hard mode fights are some of the most unique and challenging things that Blizzard has put in the game. I feel sorry for you if you have not experienced ALL of them.</div></div><hr />

Its called reading through the bullshit.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's true we don't have infinite resources and that's been true since day one of World of Warcraft. That hasn't changed.<br />
Yes, this is true. ANY person/business can say this. Its a universal statement about an impossibility of having an infinite of anything. The reality is that WoW alone pulls in $1 billion a year and if the funds were allotted, they would *effectively* have unlimited resources.<br />
<br />
I see it come up time and time again that the &quot;good&quot; devs have moved to the new project, but that too isn't true in the way people think it is and is insulting and dismissive to the guys (and gals) who have been on the team for years.<br />
Using defensive language to imply that the statement isn't true, while not denying it. Yes, there are people that have been working on the game for &quot;years&quot;. 2-3 years. There are at best a handful of people from the original or even the TBC team left.<br />
<br />
The people working on World of Warcraft are people who have been here for years or are still being guided by those who have been here for years. <br />
This is them admitting that the entire old team isn't there (which we know, and is understandable), but ALSO that the remaining team is made up of that handful of experienced 2-3yr group who are in charge of doling out the work to people who are new to the design/build of the game. What they are saying in a giant string of words is that the majority of the real work on this game is done by people with little to no experience/dedication to WoW, directed by people who have only been with the game's support for a few years.<br />
<br />
The people who &quot;left&quot; WoW haven't really left either. They are here at the studio lending their ears and thoughts to those still working on World of Warcraft. They haven't washed their hands of the game and the company hasn't washed their hands either.<br />
Lending ears and thoughts does not equal actually working on the game. This amounts to one of the noobies still working on WoW being able to get and walk over to the desk of one of the vets and asking &quot;hey can you remind me what the lore of so and so was back in vanilla ?&quot; or &quot;Hey what texture did you use for the Krol Blade?&quot;. The vets aren't investing large amounts of time in WoW, they're merely there to fix loose ends that the newer guys simply don't have knowledge of.<br />
<br />
<br />
But hey, you can believe the marketing speak all you want. Double Plus Good !<br />

I'm guessing the people complaining never played a rogue back in vanilla. Back when poisons had CHARGES and could run out completely at random times. THAT was when it was a huge pain in the ass.</div></div><hr />
