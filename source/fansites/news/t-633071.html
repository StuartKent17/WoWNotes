Raid Bug - Circle of Healing / Wild Growth prevented by Vortex<br />
We identified a bug preventing Circle of Healing and Wild Growth from being able to find targets in Vortex. It was not our intent that these heals be prevented during Vortex (beyond the nerf we already made to prevent them from being spammed).<br />
<br />
We should be able to fix this in the next couple of days. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14697634915-vortex-damage.html))<br />
<br />
Raid and UI Design - Disappearance of groups in raids<br />
Our long-term goal is to get rid of the notion of groups within a raid. We want players to be able to organize their UI however they want -- by class, by role, alphabetically or whatever. With the overhaul to the buff / debuff system we made a lot of progress towards this goal, but that left us with a few awkward reasons to still put certain players together.<br />
<br />
From a high-level, the design is to be in a group. That group can have 5, 10 or 25 max players depending on the content. There shouldn't be a (weird) notion of being in both a 5 player and 25 player group at the same time. Imagine for a 25-player raid that the UI just shows 25 players. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14697495446-gc-any-thoughts-on-raid-wide-holy-nova.html))<br />
<br />
Bigger isn't always better!<br />
Sure. My point was that the dude who takes the most damage is not the best tank. The best tank is the person who takes the least damage while still locking the mobs onto them quickly and thoroughly. Standing in the fire is not the sign of a good tank. Ignoring your Shield Block or Barkskin is not the sign of a good tank.<br />
<br />
A healer who heals mostly themselves, overheals a lot, runs out of mana, needs to borrow candles, forgets to cleanse and lets the tank die is not a good healer, even if they have the highest number.<br />
<br />
The damage-dealer who tops the chart, but pulls aggro, stands in the fire, breaks CC (lolwut?), and argues with all of your strategies is probably not the guy you want in your raid.<br />
<br />
But all other things being equal, higher numbers in damage and healing are still better and do have a strong correlation to player gear and skill. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14697301234-sorry-blizz-doesnt-balance-based-on-qq.html))<br />
<br />
Mana Pool<br />
The problem is that there should not be infinite mana classes currently in the game. You should not run OOM every single fight (if you play well). But you should not be able to ignore it either.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, Resto shamans are often listed as the healer that can run out of mana. Paladins, priests and druids should ideally play a lot more like that. They do seem to run OOM in PvP, but not really in PvE. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14697625720-design-philosophy-question.html))<br />

Starfall purpose<br />
The purpose of Starfall is to do extra damage. What I mean by that is that the spell is not channeled so you can use it along with a Hurricane or whatever other spell you want to cast. It was never intended to be a de-stealther and we've become unenamored with random stun chances added to other spells.<br />
<br />
One criticism which we think is totally valid is the paltry coefficient on Starfall. We will be hotfixing in a more reasonable number soon (tm). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14697635409-starfall-discussion.html))<br />

Talent Trees and playstyle<br />
The key is playstyle. It is easiest to explain with the death knight. The blood tree emphasizes melee combat and healing. The frost tree emphasizes frost damage and control. The unholy tree emphasizes diseases and minions.<br />
<br />
To do the same thing with hunters, you'd say that BM emphasizes the pet, MM emphasizes the shots, and SV emphasizes the traps. That's a gross generalization, but you get the idea. If you like to manage your pet, you might like BM. If you want to spend less effort running the pet in and out of combat and want traps to be a smaller part of your game, then you might look at MM, understanding that it probably means more emphasis on your ranged attacks.<br />
<br />
But you could PvP (or in the case of the death knight, tank) with any tree as long as you maximized your focus on that role with the specific talents you chose. The trees themselves become more like flavor: do you like Frost, Fire or Arcane spells?<br />
<br />
Again, this all assumes that the relative dps, pvp utility, tanking or healing are all equitable, which is something we are trying to improve. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14697605725-hunter-talent-direction.html))<br />

Warlock survavibility in PvP against paladins<br />

Guardian Spirit not procing properly the 50% heal<br />
Update: the problem does seem to be related to a second hit killing the target before the GS heal can actually kick in. We should be hotfixing in a solution soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14697593701-so-hotfix-for-gs.html))<br />

Oh and i totally agree with the partwhere there talking about people who focus too much on the numbers. Its a trend im noticing seems everyone has damage meters now a days. It like a ball player who scores 50+ points in basketball but his team still loses. So you top the damage meter but we still didnt beat the boss.</div></div><hr />

imagine =/= gonna happen. he's saying a 25 man raid should feel like a 25 man group, not 5x5man groups like the ui shows, and making buffs go from group wide to raid wide helps accomplish this</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's why meters are for finding the people scoring 6 points and telling them to shape up or ship out. a smart raid group knows what is and what isn't important, which fights favor which classes, etc. any retard can have a damage meter, but none of those retards know how to interpret the data beyond which colored bar is higher than the next.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, in raids I rarely tend to run out of mana (resto druid here). However, in heroics its a different story. With replenish there isnt any problem, but if there is no, then I actually have to use innervate at times. Not to mention raids without replenish, they are a pain in the *** :P Both healers and dps running low on mana makes the fights alot harder and longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true. MM seems more like a gimped version of Surv atm. Surv is all about shots, stings and traps, while MM is only about shots and stings. Especially now that theyve nerfed the draining (wich is good). I just rly hope they change surv hunters a bit so we actually survive a bit more. This new deterence thing rly sucks since paladin seals and dots still kill you when u cant do shit against it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good game Blizzard. So, it's ok for warlocks to have their numerous fears, including instant ones, but it's not ok for a paladin to have his against a demon or undead? Ummm hmmm, way to go. They first nerfed it by adding a cooldown of 8 seconds, and now they're thinking of &quot;fixing&quot; it because it's clearly overpowered.<br />
<br />
F*CK BLIZZARD to be honest.<br />
<br />
QQ moar, or do us a favour and delete your character.<br />
<br />
It along with banish complete ruin the ability to use our 1 very few cooldowns in PvP. <br />
<br />
And fear is a joke, too many counters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think locks have more important things to complain about than one very situational spell that only one class can do against them. <br />
<br />
Aside from that.. I think i've literally only seen one 80 warlock so far in WotLK..</div></div><hr />

The only f***** useful Glyph for arenas for a pally to survive dk's or warlocks and u wanna nerf it? (After Holy Light Glyph)<br />

Secondly, what has banish got to do with turn evil? Blablabla.<br />
Not everything is about Paladins in this world. Banish is another spell that can totally waste your Demon Form because, maybe you don't know that cause you only ever played a loladin, you become a DEMON! woot! you can be banished and do shit -&gt; 51st talent of no use whatsoever.<br />
<br />
<br />
And why is it fair that a warlock get's 3 different fears (One AoE, one instant, and the normal Fear)<br />
Dude, you're on the top of your game here. 3 fears? Where? Which ones? There's Fear, single target, 1.5 sec cast fear. There's Howl of Terror, 1.5 sec cast, 45 sec cooldown could be lowered to instant by talents. That's the AoE fear. When it's instant, it STILL is the same spell, not another one, and it still has the cooldown. I don't know, maybe you're slow or something and think that Death Coil is another fear. DC is not fear effect and has shit to do with fears. 3 secs +/- lag, GCD, etc? GTFO.<br />
<br />
And as to counters to fear.. it doesn't even need a counter nowadays. Its diminishing returns timer is shared with 10 other spells, with other classes. Not to mention trinkets, Every Man for Himself, WOTF, berserks, dispelling, totems, fear wards, bubbles and what not.<br />

But.. we got over it. Hah. We adjusted performances and lucky for us we already know how to <br />
safety dance&quot; without cheats ;P . <br />
Far as Resto Shaman, my main's resto sham -been playing her resto for three years. I do feel a little underprivelaged [lol] far as natural regen capabilities go, but almost never run OOM and still have mana-tide and potions to use at the end of every fight. the only issue ever with mana is if we're chain pulling so fast or multiple packs of mobs at a time that after so many minutes of healing harder than on a boss rofl, my mana gets low on trash.<br />
I did used to roll with JC trinkets that had mana regen and have the trinket now off Maly that has 43mp5 on equip is it? all - in - all running with 400 mp5 while casting unbuffed. raid buffed at 500mp5 while casting if i use mp5 flask. while NOT casting in raid, regen is at just under 1000 mp5. -that's all without totems. I think my mana pool helps a bit in this too, though, bc in raids with buffs [not with int elixir] have around 22k-23k mana pool, and that's a lot of mana to go through. And with imp Water shield talents, water shield glyph, and just under 39% crit on my heals in raid, that's a lot of chances to burn through water orbs that give back mana, too.<br />
I still think the other heal classes have lower mana less than myself, and have to drink less than myself overall, but still, in any given raid I rarely have to worry about my mana pool getting too low to do my job... maybe drink 6-7 times in a full 10 or 25 naxx clearing in 3.5 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude, you're on the top of your game here. 3 fears? Where? Which ones? There's Fear, single target, 1.5 sec cast fear. There's Howl of Terror, 1.5 sec cast, 45 sec cooldown could be lowered to instant by talents. That's the AoE fear. When it's instant, it STILL is the same spell, not another one, and it still has the cooldown. I don't know, maybe you're slow or something and think that Death Coil is another fear. DC is not fear effect and has shit to do with fears. 3 secs +/- lag, GCD, etc? GTFO.<br />
<br />
And as to counters to fear.. it doesn't even need a counter nowadays. Its diminishing returns timer is shared with 10 other spells, with other classes. Not to mention trinkets, Every Man for Himself, WOTF, berserks, dispelling, totems, fear wards, bubbles and what not.<br />
<br />
So happy not to be playing a lock.<br />
<br />
<br />
The demon form banish/turn issue sounds a lot like a situational counter to me - i.e. mass dispel re: bubble; dispel, devour, purge, spellsteal re: Avenging Wrath - or beacon of light for that matter. We have to fake cast enough, having to fake cast to get that felpuppy off us fucking sucks.<br />
<br />
Added to that, for that one extremely situational ability to be instant cast, it takes one of our major glyph slots. Not that we have much else worth taking for pvp, but that is a different issue. <br />
<br />
I agree that warlocks have it pretty rough at the moment, but looking at something as miniscule as the turn evil glyph as a scapegoat is bloody rediculous. The real problem is the pew pew melee train fucking you up the arse, not the turn evil glyph.<br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't really addressing the real issue yet, that of fixing pvp - and to be honest I can't blame them, the game has reached such a high level of complexity that balancing pvp against pve would be a nightmare. But until they do, imo pvp is bullshit. I'm not finding arena fun, certainly not to the degree that I found it in burning crusade.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-02-03, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its a trend im noticing seems everyone has damage meters now a days.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was in an OS25 pug where after every single fight (including trash) the recount was spammed and the people on the top made fun of the people on the bottom. The same people that were on top died during every single drake fight (just about). The meter was led by mostly dks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Columhcille</div><div class="date">2009-02-03, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damage and heal meters -agreed, just looking at numbers isn't enough. Some people get stuck on &quot;omg i did this much dmg!&quot; <br />
But, seriously.omg look.. you died 8 times more than the next person bc you were being stupid or pulling threat or not paying attention.<br />
However, I don't think the purpose of many damage meters is to simply show output of said dmg or said heals. I know in our guild, every night after raid we go into recount or on WWS, and utilize the graphs and charts that are put in place to see.. &quot;ok, this rogue is using this ability over this ability, but shouldn't he be using this instead&quot; or.. &quot;this shammy is using greater heal FTL, ? WTF? and there's no regen seen on meters from water shield, so is he/she even keeping his water shield up to keep mana regen maximized&quot;??? <br />
It's all in utilizing the tool for what it is meant to be, not for a race of output. It's a GUAGE OF EFFICIENCY so that we can learn to be more effective in our jobs in groups and to test theories on output and certain abilities, and to make sure everyone is pulling their own weight. If you're watching output simply because you want to be &quot;first&quot; on the list, you're using your meter addons incorrectly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-02-03, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, in raids I rarely tend to run out of mana (resto druid here). However, in heroics its a different story. With replenish there isnt any problem, but if there is no, then I actually have to use innervate at times. Not to mention raids without replenish, they are a pain in the *** :P Both healers and dps running low on mana makes the fights alot harder and longer.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have not had any real mana issues on my druid in heroics after I hit 1000 spirit. Then again, when I heal I run with smart dps and tanks that actually don't take a lot of damage. Normally I can group heal most heroics with a lifebloom x1 and rejuvenation on the entire party including the tank. On some boss fights I actually have to cast a few heals but still nothing major. Having 1000 spirit and 1800+ spell power really helps. The only time I have ran out of mana was when I was single healing the off tank and both ranged tanks in Naxx10.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-02-03, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good game Blizzard. So, it's ok for warlocks to have their numerous fears, including instant ones, but it's not ok for a paladin to have his against a demon or undead? Ummm hmmm, way to go. They first nerfed it by adding a cooldown of 8 seconds, and now they're thinking of &quot;fixing&quot; it because it's clearly overpowered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, locks have plate armor, heals, bubble, cleanse, and insane burst damage, and paladins have to have an instant cc spell for their pets to control them before the pet does enough damage to kill the paladin. Are you freaking kidding me?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-02-03, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for fear being a joke, tell me what these counters are please. For a paladin, there's, ooh, hmm, Bubble. Yeah, 5 min CD for something that'll be off of DR in 15 seconds time. Trinket.... not everyone uses one for PvP, and those that do, they're still stuck with getting feared after trinketing. Deathknights, yeah, they got Lichborne and Shadow of death. This isn't about death knights though, it's about Paladins and Warlocks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ret paladin that is decently geared can pop that bubble right after fear and have the warlock dead before the bubble wears off.<br />
<br />
As far as paladins not having any utility because they lose turn evil on instant cast, paladins were never designed to be a cc class (they can be but they weren't designed to be).<br />
<br />
The difference is that when you strip away warlock fear you get a dead warlock. When you remove paladin fear you have a dead warlock. Stop thinking of only your class for once. The game isn't balanced for you to always win, and if you had your way it would be.</div></div><hr />

It says you turn into a demon which means yes it should classify you as a demon. Tree druids turn into an elemental. Cat/bear druids turn into beast. Moonkin druids use to be considered as beasts, but are no longer. Death knights can turn into undead. All of these abilities start to classify the caster as another type of mob, so anything that turns you into a demon should turn you into a demon form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You just described permanent transformations, minus the DK one. The thing is, Metamorphosis is a 51 point talent with a 3 minute cooldown. Warlocks who get this talent really dont need 2 additional ways to get CCed during it. I think we can make an exception in this case. Of course I'm always open to blizzard doing an overhaul of warlocks to make it so they can actually compete in pvp again. Then maybe we can leave them as demons :)</div></div><hr />

If that's the case I really don't understand why they would even think to nerf turn evil on the basis that vs locks it's too much for them to handle. meh, but i don't pvp much other than WG so it's never really affected me.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Thank god for rerolling.<br />
<br />
Also lol @ thinking one class having an ability means your class's version is immune to nerfs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyvou</div><div class="date">2009-02-04, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find myself in the position of playing a Paladin and a Warlock... both at endgame. I'd have to say that in my pvp experience (Even though my paladin is prot right now) that the turn-evil glyph... &quot;whoo hoo&quot; Most warlocks are going to be destro and nuke with the burst damage, or stand in the back and kite with affliction, or demonology, but specced out of the metamorph talent. It's nice, and somewhat silly to say that a warlock can do incredible damage if they are being ignored or have the lawlret paladin fucking everyone up the ass that comes near the warlock... but every class can do that. The only thing is that our fear, which only when affliction specced, is an instant cast 6 seconds with diminishing returns. What you don't understand is that warlock is affliction. -IF- the warlock has enough time to throw on his DoT rotation to be effective (or is SoC spamming) there are ... I think 7-8 dots. Hmm... Think how long, even with those dots being instant cast, takes to cast. On -one- target. Vs. the ret paladin that just goes *STUN* LAWLLAWLLAWLLAWLLAWL and your face is melted. On my lock, i've played as every spec so far and would have to say that warlocks can be played fine if they are played smart. Stay near your other classes and take advantage of the extra time you can get. If warlocks could get a few more &quot;Oh shit!&quot; spells and tricks to get the opponent off their face, or actually mitigate the melee damage like Blizz intends, then I see great potential for warlocks.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvE Wise, I have seen warlocks on top of dps charts... the damage is dependent on SKILL 1st, gear second, class third. But that's just common sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It along with banish complete ruin the ability to use our 1 very few cooldowns in PvP. <br />
<br />
And fear is a joke, too many counters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mass Dispel completely ruins lolbubble. School lockdowns lockdown lolbubble. Hard counter. QQ moar, as you say?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, locks have plate armor, heals, bubble, cleanse, and insane burst damage, and paladins have to have an instant cc spell for their pets to control them before the pet does enough damage to kill the paladin. Are you freaking kidding me?<br />
<br />
<br />
The pet dog is dangerous for it's casting lockdown (you're not using a different pet are you?). Holy paladins in particular are very sensitive to lockdown (note that bubble is &quot;holy&quot; and gets locked too). Hence it's a nice defense to have.<br />
<br />
Heals and cleanse use up GCDs, just as it takes GCDs to put up dots. Plate is useless against shadow and other magic damage. Retnoobs can be dangerous, but learn to kite - I think a lot of locks are still used to their TBC godmode of draintanking everyone, but now you need to actually pay attention... :P</div></div><hr />

As far as melee dps goes, we think rogues, cats and Arms warriors are all a little low. We haven't announced specific changes yet but they are coming.<br />
<br />
Anyone else find this funny?<br />
&quot;Cats&quot;, a spec<br />
&quot;Arms&quot;, a spec<br />
&quot;Rogues&quot;, the whole class...lol<br />
Lets leave a whole class broken for months before we even suggest a change. Now all we have to do is wait a couple more weeks for some suggested changes, then about 2 weeks after that we may see them in game. <br />
<br />
Awesome....</div></div><hr />
