Top PvE Gear used in PvP<br />
One of the problems we had last season (and the first season when you think about it) was that you need a minimum threshold of resilience to really be viable. A change like this would only make that curve steeper. Having 1000 resilience would be even more powerful than having 500 resilience.<br />
<br />
We do want PvE gear to be a decent substitute until you can collect enough PvP gear. The PvE gear was too dominant in some cases in the previous season, we think because:<br />
<br />
-- When everyone's resilience is low, doing damage quickly becomes even more important, so gear that doesn't &quot;waste&quot; stats on resilience become more optimal.<br />
<br />
-- PvE gear from Naxx, particularly the KT weapons, were easier to collect than the PvP equivalents. That isn't going to be as true in this season because Ulduar is more challenging and the higher item level weapons from PvE are going to be even less accessible. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904200671-great-idea-making-pvp-gear-a-lot-better.html))<br />
<br />
Amount of class changes in future patches<br />
That said, I don't think you will continue to see as much class change for the rest of Lich King. Many of the changes in 3.1 were to address problems introduced when we made big changes in 3.0. You can look at the classes that have had the most iteration, and in most cases those are the classes who were restructured a little bit in Lich King: warlocks, hunters, priests, paladins and the new class.<br />
<br />
We will continue to tweak numbers up and down as needed, but I would not anticipate as many talent or mechanic changes for the next several patches (though there will be some). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903630918-can-we-get-a-break-from-patches---plzzzzzzz.html))<br />
<br />
Class balance and overpowered specs<br />
I don't think it's that formulaic. I'm not going to list the classes or specs that have historically been powerful in the various Arena seasons, because that will just turn this thread into various players jumping in to argue about how they really weren't that powerful. But many of them did not have every item on your list. Sometimes a single powerful ability can make up for a lot of &quot;lacks&quot; and the truth is we like for classes to ultimately have strengths and weaknesses, not just a whole bunch of strengths.<br />
<br />
If you look at the classes that are powerful now and those that have historically been dominant, I think it comes down to two things:<br />
<br />
-- A mix of offensive and defensive capabilities, especially active (i.e. non-passive) ones.<br />
-- Being a good complement to the abilities, strengths and weaknesses of other classes in order to make a strong comp. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903630963-only-a-handful-of-classes--comps-are-viable.html))<br />

Upcoming Warlock PTR changes<br />
Fire and Brimstone -- After a lot of feedback and testing, we think we are going to change this again. Now increases the damage done by your Incinerate and Chaos Bolt by 15% on targets afflicted by Immolate, and increases the critical strike chance of your Conflagrate by 25%. The first portion of the talent is now a pure percent boost instead of modifying the “bonus” that Incinerate gets. It was too confusing to players and had some weird side-effects, such as Chaos Bolt not scaling well with Incinerate if Incinerate did more damage.<br />
<br />
Incinerate and Immolate -- There does seem to be a bug where spellpower is not getting applied correctly. We don't know at this point if this is an old or new bug. Certainly there used to be a lot of spells that didn't scale with spellpower, though we now make an attempt to make sure almost all of them do. It may matter less with the F&amp;B change, but we'll still get it resolved.<br />
<br />
Conflagrate -- We still intend to leave this as it currently works on live (not consuming the Immolate).<br />
<br />
We understand sometimes players can get whiplash from our rapid iteration. That's just the way we designed, though we perhaps have not always communicated the design churn as openly as we do today. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474166357-conflag-change-clarification.html))<br />

WoW Spin-off to be launched in China?<br />
A few weeks ago, Blizzard published a press release (http://www.blizzard.com/us/press/090416.html) to announce the end of their partnership with The9 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The9) in China. The9 has been the operator of World of Warcraft in china for the past years and even if their partnership with Blizzard will end in a few months, it definitely looks like they don't plan to give up on WoW yet. <br />
<br />
Earlier this month, The9 opened a site for a new game called World of Fight (http://www.wofchina.com/) ... The font used in the flash banner of the site is the same font used in World of Warcraft and we can assume that they will try to rename the game and keep the players on their own version of the game. <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure they would break a ton of copyright laws by doing that but it depends a lot on their contracts with Blizzard and if they actually manage to launch the game and start developing new content, we might see another version of WoW on the asian market. As of today, I would say that it's still very unlikely, Blizzard won't give up easily and The9 doesn't really have any experience in game development.<br />
<br />
However, Electronic Arts owns 15% of The9 and one of the few possibility is to try to gather as many players as possible on the new site and ultimately change it into Warhammer Online. Of course this is just speculation from my side, but it seems that the background picture looks surprisingly similar to a starting zone from Warhammer (http://media.photobucket.com/image/chaos%20starting%20zone%20warhammer/Svartmetall/Misc/Burzum_001.jpg). <br />
<br />
The new operator of World of Warcraft in China will be Netease.com, you can find more information about that on their site (http://wow.163.com/) and in the press release (http://www.blizzard.com/us/press/090416.html). <br />

<br />
Oh yeah, only S1 and S5 had this problem... I mean, who EVER saw a rogue during S3/S4 with dual wargleves and/or 4-T6/4-Glad Parts who was complettely overpowered ::)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
-- PvE gear from Naxx, particularly the KT weapons, were easier to collect than the PvP equivalents. That isn't going to be as true in this season because Ulduar is more challenging and the higher item level weapons from PvE are going to be even less accessible.<br />
<br />
Again, this wasnt introduced with Naxx and KT...<br />
Archimonde / cot raid was extremely easy and the 2h sword was so much better than its S3 counterpart.<br />
Illidan wasnt that hard either, Wargleves were ridiciously good (even better than S4 which werent in game at that time) and shard of azzinoth also was better than S3 daggers.</div></div><hr />

It IS the Chaos starting zone from WAR. Go to the World of Fail website (where you can see it full size) and then look at the screenshot of the Chaos starting zone. They're not just similar. They're the same.<br />

<br />
Ret: Kiteable for over half the time, with no distance closer. You may complain if you're a warrior, but hey, that's the bad part about having a hard counter. Also vulnerable to mana drains, silences, and dispels. Distinct lack of a healing reduction debuff.<br />
<br />
Prot: Magic damage done to the paladin, silences, snares, dispels (even moreso than ret), and disarms/dismantles.<br />
<br />
Holy: Very susceptible to silence and interrupt effects, no HoTs, 1 instant heal, once again very vulnerable to magic damage dealt (see a freaking theme here? we have plate). Mana drain effects, while Holys do have a large mana pool, are still effective, as is dispelling all of the Paladin's mana regen talents and skills.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, a Paladin is meant to wreck face when they finally get in melee range. If you let a Paladin get in melee range, it's your fault, and you usually end up paying pretty heavily.<br />

I dont really understand the logic of bliz... How exactly pvp weapons are easier to get than pve weapon?<br />
Lets forget about hard mode weapons, they buff it to impossible mode, your opponent will be less likely to get one anyway.<br />
They remove the S5 weapons instead of giving a chance people to get lower rank pvp weapons and they nerf easy mode so even retards i mean &quot;casual pve but hardcore pvpers&quot; can get their good stuff there... <br />
Not to mention, you can buy epic pve amour from pve emblems... And if you have skill, all you need to do is farm na25 enough from the last season to get 4 pieces of hateful and afk at winter grasp every 2.5h for the honor/wintergrasp pvp gear. Then, can go from 0 rank to 1000 with PVE weapons.<br />
Oh, and they even nerf KT, so he dont wipe the no brainer dps after he mind control.<br />
<br />
There is no way to get rid of pve weapons dominance, if they dont make lower rank pvp weapons easier to obtain... Why bother waste points to buy a pvp weapon while your opponent is most likely holding a pve weapon anyway?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ret: Kiteable for over half the time, with no distance closer. You may complain if you're a warrior, but hey, that's the bad part about having a hard counter. Also vulnerable to mana drains, silences, and dispels. Distinct lack of a healing reduction debuff.<br />
<br />
Prot: Magic damage done to the paladin, silences, snares, dispels (even moreso than ret), and disarms/dismantles.<br />
<br />
Holy: Very susceptible to silence and interrupt effects, no HoTs, 1 instant heal, once again very vulnerable to magic damage dealt (see a freaking theme here? we have plate). Mana drain effects, while Holys do have a large mana pool, are still effective, as is dispelling all of the Paladin's mana regen talents and skills.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, a Paladin is meant to wreck face when they finally get in melee range. If you let a Paladin get in melee range, it's your fault, and you usually end up paying pretty heavily.<br />
<br />
TLDR: L2P, Paladins are fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You baddie , rerolled the class just as WoTLK started because you blew at others and now that of course you &quot;found the right class that suits you&quot; you tell others to L2P.<br />

More like twenty yards. Which is of course so terribly easy to avoid against a class that passively moves faster than you, can prevent you from moving any faster, and has several abilities to pop that give it COMPLETE IMMUNITY to slowing effects.<br />
Oh, and of course it's their design to beat anything at melee range because, you know, it's very easy to kite them as a rogue or warrior.<br />
<br />
If, as a paladin, you are not able to reliably get into melee range against any class then YOU ARE BAD. <br />

<br />
-- It doesn't matter if it breaks copyright rules, World of Warcraft is NOT copyrighted in China. China is it's own country and they could straight up rip off ANY thing they want and get away with it. Copyright only stretches as far as our border (generally speaking)<br />
<br />
<br />
This does not seem correct. China is a member of the Berne Convention. Article 5(1) of the Berne Convention states that &quot;[a]uthors shall enjoy, in respect of works for which they are protected under this Convention, in countries of the Union other than the country of origin, the rights which their respective laws do now or may hereafter grant to their nationals, as well as the rights specially granted by this Convention.&quot; The US and China are both countries, and Blizzard's copyrighted IP is therefore protected in China.<br />
<br />
Article 9(1) says that the &quot;[a]uthors of literary and artistic works protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorizing the reproduction of these works, in any manner or form.&quot; This sort of speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
China is also a member of TRIPs. Article 10(1) of TRIPs provides that &quot;Computer programs, whether in source or object code, shall be protected as literary works under the Berne Convention (1971).&quot; The Berne Convention gives exclusive rights to copyright holders of literary works in all member countries, so it seems that Blizzard does in fact have WoW copyrighted in China, as it is was copyrighted in the US the moment it was fixed in some tangible medium of expression with sufficient originality and all that stuff.<br />
<br />
Whether China enforces the laws is another matter, but they do have copyright laws, and Blizzard's work is protected.</div></div><hr />

I'd probably assume as another said, that The9 may lose WoW and try to do something else, or fail copy the game, but some other company will probably just pick up where they left off. I'm sure there are a lot of companies that would love have that market.</div></div><hr />

I read somewhere, I forget, that wow china players jump to taiwan servers. There's the korean servers too and singapore. But I think taiwan speak the same language so it's easier kinda like aussies playing on US servers instead of the much closer asian servers.<br />
<br />
BTW, aussies don't get their own servers, they get US servers labeled as oceanic. :P</div></div><hr />

The problem is the pve geared retri , both in arena and in bgs / outdoor. <br />
The dmg output in pve gear with cds up - wings or bubble - is just high, too high. <br />
If im right, Blizzard said, they will think about it, to prevent retri pallys using every single cd on the first 10sec, since all their abilitys got higher cds than other dps classes, but the other dps classes aren'T destroying you in the first 10sec.<br />
Im sure, blizz will figure out something for it, its not that bad as many ppl saying, just not that much enjoyable in bgs :)</div></div><hr />

You can make this kind of one sided count of strengths for any class, you know. Not saying you don't have a grain of truth there, but biased list of the strengths of a class, leaving out the weaknesses is not exactly how you can win arguments.<br />
<br />
Also, didn't Blizzard nerf retribution burst damage? Judgements have been toned down for sure, and while the overall damage done is the same, it is less bursty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wasn't intended to be a list of strengths, biased or otherwise, of the paladin. (It is far from exhaustive)<br />
<br />
I'm just tired of terrible pallies constantly harping on about their burst being balanced by non-existent range issues. That said, burst damage is only part of why pallies are fairly powerful at the moment and, imo, it's not the largest factor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you honestly believe Blizzard is doing their best at balancing the game you are obviouly a PvE-only player or just blind. As long as people subscribe and THINK the devs are trying to balance something for the next patch it's all fine. They just keep saying &quot;hey next patch will be the patch&quot;, but it won't be.<br />
<br />
The worst is that you see the same problems with balance now in WOTLK as you did 4+ years ago. Oh and all these things changed with WOTLK was suggested in Vanilla WoW. That shows how incompetent they are. If it were to the higher end community to balance the game it would be a whole lot different. I also love how Blizzard removed some RNG only to implement new ones. Pathetic.</div></div><hr />

Just want to stop your guessing game for &quot;WoF&quot;.......Its a Chinese self-development game call &#12298;&#21517;&#23558;&#19977;&#22269;&#12299;&#65292;but when it translated its call Warriors of fate online. So whatever your copyright probably doesn't exist unless using Warhammer background as Advertisement counts.<br />

Shard bag = non opening bag / box with a little counter on it which goes up to 99.<br />
<br />
For 3 freaking years i played warlock, and finally the shard situation got too much for me and rerolled char.<br />
<br />
Retarded they havtn changed it and dont have a clue that Warlock has to farm unecessarily more than any other class.<br />

Makes raiding and arena and duels proper retarded for locks.</div></div><hr />
