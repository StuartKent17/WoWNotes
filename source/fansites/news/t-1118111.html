WoWDB Update - Advanced Tooltips<br />
We're progressing on WoWDB and even if it's still far from finished, we just climbed the first step toward improving how we work on MMO-Champion: advanced tooltips! <br />
<br />
They're basically the same thing as regular tooltips but with more information when possible. Obviously we're not gathering data from users yet and we will start doing so in a few weeks when the beta looks a little more stable, but as soon as we do we will be expanding the information readily available to users. <br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/april/advtooltips.png<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://static-azeroth.cursecdn.com/current/js/syndication/tt.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
We're very considerate (yes, we are!) and also took into account that some people might not like the new tooltips, that's why we're giving you the choice! If you want to control the tooltip type for each spell, you can add &quot;?simple&quot; or &quot;?advanced&quot; to the WoWDB link. For example: <br />
<br />
<br />
Flamestrike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/2120?simple) (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/2120?simple)<br />
Blood Presence (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48263?advanced) (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48263?advanced)<br />
<br />
If as a site owner you want to disable them, you can also do it by embedding the following code with your tt.js. Users who want to use the advanced versions of tooltips will still be able to use the ?advanced links on your site, but any regular link will default to the simple version. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://static-azeroth.cursecdn.com/current/js/syndication/tt.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;var WowDbSettings = { AdvancedTooltips: false };&lt;/script&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Where are we going with this? The ultimate goal is pretty simple, if we're doing things right, you shouldn't have to visit the site to get your information. It's also going to be incredibly useful since it will let us track a lot more things on patch days, making our classes changes much more accurate and interesting. This is obviously very much a work in progress and we will be improving this over the next days/weeks but we're terribly interested in feedback and wanted to launch the feature as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
In the end, the database has a long way to go. The interface is pretty terrible and finding anything is hard. We're on our way to fixing it (we'll do a first pass on navigation/filters this week now that things are implemented, new design a little later) and we're busy experimenting with cool stuff. It should be fairly shiny soon!<br />
<br />
Feedback on the new tooltips would be greatly appreciated! <br />

Changes to Inactive Guild Leader Replacement<br />
Inactive Guild Leader Replacement was added to World of Warcraft in patch 4.3, and allows an active member to take over the guild leadership position from an inactive guild leader, encouraging guild activity by giving players a way to promote a new leader if theirs has been absent for an extended period of time.<br />
<br />
Based on your feedback, we recently modified the Inactive Guild Leader Replacement process. From our most recent hotfixes for World of Warcraft (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/4023884):<br />
<br />
Inactive guild leader replacement now requires 90 days of absence, up from 30 days.<br />
Ascent to the rank of guild leader is now only available to guild members at Rank 2, 3, or 4, where the guild leader is considered Rank 1.<br />
<br />
The option to dethrone the guild leader is only visible to the highest-ranked player logged in at any given time.<br />
<br />
Since we made this change in a hotfix, it is still possible for the in-game process to present itself to guild members who are at Rank 4 or lower. However, if a guild member at Rank 4 or lower attempts to replace the absent guild leader, they will see an error in-game. This will only be the case until we apply a change to a future patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Patch 4.3.4 Notes<br />
Ticket Submission UI Improvements<br />
<br />
A new Submit Bug button has been added. Clicking this option will open a report dialog box, along with basic instructions on what to include in your bug report.<br />
A new Submit Suggestion button has been added. Clicking this option will open a text dialog box, along with a description of what to include in your suggestion.<br />
The Report Lag button has been removed.<br />
The Report Abuse button is now called Report Player.<br />
<br />
The Report Player function offers four categories: Spamming, Language, Name, and Cheating.<br />
Reporting a player for Cheating now opens a text window in which a description of the occurrence can be written.<br />
Reporting a Name opens a window with three categories: Player Name, Guild Name, and Arena Team Name. There is also a text field for optional information.<br />
Report Player now includes text and visual instructions for how to submit a report.<br />
Right-clicking a characterâ€™s portrait now offers additional reporting options.<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Annual Pass Invite Order<br />
We've stated in the past there are several ways by which candidates are invited to test Mists of Pandaria beta. All we've said with regard to Annual Pass holders is that they'll be invited before people who submitted through our opt-in process, and that they'll be invited in order of Annual Pass purchase date and total cumulative play time on the account.<br />
<br />
So here are a few things I didn't feel like typing on Twitter to one person all but accusing us of a conspiracy:<br />
<br />
1) You don't have access to enough information to determine with certainty the way in which each and every person flagged for beta access was invited.<br />
<br />
2) Even if you were able to prove that one Annual Pass holder was invited a) in an Annual Pass invite wave, and b) before someone who purchased their Annual Pass earlier, has more cumulative play time on their account, and was also invited in an Annual Pass wave, that still doesn't prove there's a systemic flaw in the way in which all accounts are being flagged.<br />
<br />
3) We're aware that the terminology we used when initially announcing the Annual Pass feature was misleading. We've already stated we regret the way that went down. That said, we had no reason to falsely claim we'd be distributing invites in a way we had no intention of actually following. There's just no good reason to lie about that and hope people wouldn't catch on. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220974-zarhym-twitter/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4488638893?page=3#50))<br />
<br />
Red Panda Male Tail<br />
We consider the pandaren models pretty much done: i.e. the distinctive longer tails for female red-coloured pandaren, that we like, are there to stay. Let's say it like this: we don't want to repeat the female worgen on this one. We don't want to second-guess the design. <br />
<br />
This may just be my interpretation and not our company's, but the way I see it is that with many things there's always going to be people that like it exactly how it is â€” as we do â€” and those that don't. If we change it, the people who didn't like it before the change might be satisfied by it changing, but there's also the chance they might not be. What's guaranteed, though, is that those who did like it just as it was (usually the silent majority) definitely won't like it being changed. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220363-feedback-red-panda-male-tail/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3553420256?page=6#108))<br />
<br />
Jewelled Panthers<br />
So I am not sure offhand if any of this information is new or not, but here it is anyhow just in case any of it is news to you. <br />
<br />
These will be Jewelcrafter recipes and we're not actually completely decided on whether there will be a recipe for each colour, or whether the creation of one will produce one of the four colours at random. <br />
<br />
As I think you already know, the black one will be a little different. It's a flying mount and it'll be created by combining the other four mount colours together. <br />
<br />
We're estimating that the cost of creating these mounts will be very expensive. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220906-jewelled-panthers/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3660208478?page=1#8))<br />

Monk Mistweaver Feedback<br />
We don't want to need Agility.<br />
We don't want that either. Mistweavers should use Intellect leather. We just have to make sure that any of their damage-dealing abilities don't make Agi attractive. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220293-monk-mistweaver-feedback/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4363776520?page=15#290))<br />

Holy Paladin Solo DPS<br />
We don't want Holy to be a DPS spec, but we do want Holy paladins to be able to do reasonable damage when solo, to keep up pressure in PvP, or when grouped in moments when healing isn't critical. Holy Shock and Denounce are supposed to provide that damage, but their numbers are abysmally weak at the moment. We will fix.<br />
<br />
The above is relevant to all healer specs mind you. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220927-paladin-holy-solo-dps/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4427669350?page=1#13))<br />

Affliction Warlock Feedback<br />
We are discussing removing the limit one on Agony. We think Malefic Grasp already solves the same problem of wanting to make sure that focusing on a single target can be as effective as multi-dotting the room.<br />
<br />
(As an aside, it's fine to multi-dot the room, but we want to avoid a situation where a dot class is either terrible with one target or doubles everyone else's damage when there are multiple targets.)<br />
<br />
If we make the Agony change, then Soul Swap could move Agony and UA and feel worth doing (assuming Seeds already covers Corruption in an AE environment). It's also possible we could just bring down the Soul Swap cooldown as well.

Just like that, we go from working with every other Panda to being their sworn enemies, even family members, just because I wanted to be with the Alliance instead?<br />

It feels so...contrived. I understand the reasoning behind it, they want there to be war - but holy shit is it hamfisted.<br />

There needs to be more confrontation between Ji &amp; Aysa on the Wandering Isle, or some splitting event.<br />

It's cool, but it didn't have soul like the alliance one. It just feels more personal fighting with Varian and watching him laugh it off as opposed to Garrosh throwing you into an arena and then saying welcome to the horde. That simple fight actually made me like Varian a whole lot more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really hope they implement some form of VO for Varian and Garrosh when they walk around and say what they have to say. <br />
<br />
You don't need VO to the extent of SWTOR, but C'mon I think Blizzard has the funds and resources to at least add VO in big moments like this in the game. Adds Depth to characters like Varian/Garrosh and allows you to be drawn into the game so much more then having to read Text Bubble after Bubble.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's just early beta and they have every intention to add them, but based off past moments like this, I doubt it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just remembered the Horde version of the Twilight Highlands intro ... Looked it up on YT and that has VO ... So hopefully if they did VO for that (Which added SO much more to that scene and moment) then they will also add VO for the moments like this.</div></div><hr />

You don't need VO to the extent of SWTOR, but C'mon I think Blizzard has the funds and resources to at least add VO in big moments like this in the game. Adds Depth to characters like Varian/Garrosh and allows you to be drawn into the game so much more then having to read Text Bubble after Bubble.<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's just early beta and they have every intention to add them, but based off past moments like this, I doubt it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just remembered the Horde version of the Twilight Highlands intro ... Looked it up on YT and that has VO ... So hopefully if they did VO for that (Which added SO much more to that scene and moment) then they will also add VO for the moments like this.<br />
<br />
Beta is beta.<br />
<br />
I admit it's a little difficult to tell which scenes will get voice acting and which ones won't. In Cataclysm for example Vashj'ir had huge amounts of voiceovers (even the idle chatter before bordering the ship was voiced) yet Uldum had basically none even during the climax. In this case I have reasonably high hopes. The quest dialogue was only finalized relatively recently, and Blizzard is sure to want to use voiceovers as a means of &quot;selling&quot; the Pandaren starting area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Idk I think you might be playing one of those classes that cant kill healers because I still think healers are easy to kill even in 2's as long as your healer knows how to support you with damage and utility. I only play DK, Mage and Lock in arena but with competent teammates I have rarely had issues killing healers this season until the 2k+ mmr range bracket range but even then... its more about their teammates utility and overall peels than the actual healer power.<br />
<br />
Also remember you have to ignore what the response says and understand that Blizzard uses political spin to combat how childish some of their fans are. I'll translate into Blizzonian for you: &quot;We'll give you enough DPS to do quests at about a quarter of the rate you would as a DPS spec so you cheap crybabies and those that refuse to use dual speccing for one of its intended purposes will STFU... Seriously you guys are douches. If you want to do damage use a DPS spec... But since you won't here's some lip service and a whopping 2% damage buff. Did I mention you're all crybaby douchbags that are wasting precious development time? ... because you are. So suck it up pretend like your a rational human being and go play DPS spec&quot;</div></div><hr />

You are correct - spoiler alerts are considerate and not mandatory. The problem is that - just to take this news post as an example - there are many topics gathered within one place. How am I to discuss those with other users without tripping up on the other conversations taking place at the same time? Also, I stayed away from most Cataclysm data-mining and my druid lost Tree form and I didn't even recognize my paladin; so now I keep up with data-mining so I can try to advocate for/against something while something still has a chance of being changed/adjusted. Informed conjecture is just that - conjecture. Finally, I feel there is a difference between data-mining &amp; conjecture, and spoilers - one is spells and abilities and guesstimation, the other is centered around lore and environments. I choose not to watch the videos or click on screenshots.<br />

<br />
A) If the spell heals for 10k + 16% of SP over 18 secs, then shouldn't the line read <br />
