We're pleased to announce that the two recently revealed in-game pets, Lil' Ragnaros and the Moonkin Hatchling, are now available in the Pet Store section of the online Blizzard Store at a price of $10 each.<br />
<br />
Lil' Ragnaros, the Tiniest Firelord<br />
<br />
Ragnaros, the dread master of all fire elementals, will return in Cataclysm to avenge his defeat in Molten Core. And what better way to head into battle than with a miniature version of the firelord himself following at your beck and call? Lil' Ragnaros, just like his full-scale namesake, burns with constant fury (not to mention flames that serve as a handy cooking fire) and comes equipped with the legendary hammer Sulfuras. And as a being of pure elemental fire, he has no need to walk from place to place -- he just submerges into the magma below the world's surface when you start walking and reemerges when you stop.<br />
<br />
Moonkin Hatchling Charity Pet -- For the Children!<br />
<br />
The googly-eyed Moonkin Hatchling, which comes in unique Horde and Alliance versions, will occasionally plant flowers at your feet, and happily /dances with any willing partners. Like last year's Pandaren Monk, the Moonkin Hatchling has a soft spot for helping children. For every Moonkin Hatchling adopted from November 29 through December 31, 2010, Blizzard Entertainment will donate 50% of the $10 purchase price to the Make-A-Wish Foundation®.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks to the support of all the World of Warcraft players out there who purchased the Pandaren Monk last year, we were able to donate more than $1.1 million to Make-A-Wish this past February. We’re looking forward to making another big contribution to this great cause on behalf of the World of Warcraft community following the close of this year’s promotion.<br />
<br />
To learn more about the Pet Store, please visit the Pet Store FAQ, and for more information about the Make-A-Wish Foundation® in the U.S. visit www.wish.org and outside the U.S. visit www.worldwish.org.<br />

They're a business. They don't even have to donate to charity. The fact that they are donating 50% of that to charity is a big deal to said charity.<br />
<br />
I have an idea, instead of you whining and bitching in a forum why don't you donate your 15 dollars a month instead of playing WoW?</div></div><hr />

Yes, how amoral of them to give 50% of their profit (which is going to be HUGE just like last time) to a charity organisation instead of having 100% of the profit for themselves. They're like satan and lucifer combined!<br />

Compare and contrast the Blizzard offer to Yoko Ono's donation of ALL the proceeds from iTune sales of John Lennon's Give Peace a chance to the United Nations until the end of the year if you want to &quot;measure&quot; the scale of Blizzard's generosity.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard were truly motivated by Charity they would voluntarily donate to a variety of charities and/or Champion a particular cause and create a program to promote giving to charities using their vast customer base similar to Ronald McDonald houses which are sponsored by the company as well as individual donations at franchises or any other countless examples.<br />

There is a huge difference between selling items that have no impact on the game for real money and selling loot for real money. I doubt Blizzard will ever cross that line and I think they are smart enough not to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm surprised they didn't just go ahead and put a link to the Pet Store in the Achievement box.<br />

What (s)he said<br />
I normally don't complain about they tricks to make money such as the horse mount, the plushies, ... but this move is just terribly low even though it goes to charity.. <br />
didn't they mention at blizzcon it would be 100% btw? might be wrong, but thought I heared so.</div></div><hr />

A lot of companies went out of business with a pure profit strategy and disregarding their customers. If they'd ever sell items they would lose money and they know it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having played a few free to play MMORPGS which is financed by selling In-game items I can't see it going further than this. The closest thing Blizzard may do with selling non-vanity items will be if they release a new free-to-play game. <br />
<br />
Anyway, why not complain at your local supermarket for trying to sell you stuff you don't need? I mean, once they offer you something completely new to buy, you should really complain. Blizzard is just like your local super market a company which sells stuff. Occasional they decide to try something new or different, and there is nothiing wrong with this. Blizzard is not any special exception from this. If they are by any chance I would want to hear why. <br />

Some of you guys seem to think Blizzard is doing some public service thing..they are not lol..</div></div><hr />

Couldnt you atleast keep out the word &quot;retard&quot; from every 3rd sentense? -.-<br />
<br />
People want a cute in-game pet, 50% goes to charity and 50% goes to sponsor their (maybe) favourite games company. Where is the wrong in that?<br />
You don't want to pay for in-game pets, others do. Get over it.</div></div><hr />

I've always been on the fence on this one. I've always thought it was ok for people to buy pets if they wanted because they're only peripheral, and Blizz wouldnt screw us people that were just paying our monthly subscription to them and will still keep incorporating loads of cool new pets for things achievements...<br />
<br />
...such as logging in on the 6th aniversary of WoW :| <br />
<br />
hmmph. Can't believe they've not even bothered with a pet or tabbard or anything. just an achievement and a letter in the post. yay. <br />
The timing of the pet anouncements really doesnt help.<br />
<br />
It's a bit like going &quot;Thankyou for coming to my Birthday party, being there for me for the whole year and all the money you've been giving me.... sorry, you're not getting a thankyou present back but I'l sell you some SUPER cool ones instead if you have evem more money. GIEF MONEY!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is a company.<br />
Companies need money.<br />
Most of profits Blizzard makes goes towards keeping up their servers.<br />
Rest of most of profit Blizzard makes goes towards keeping customers happy, (a.k.a Warcraft movie coming out)<br />
A pet like this actually takes a team of 3-4 people a few months to do, very hard stuff.<br />
Blizzard might not care, they might get more money, but who gives a shit? The foundation getting 50% sure doesn't, cause they are actually GETTING money, they dont care if Blizzard gets even more.<br />
I'm buying the pet because 1. It's awesome, 2. It gives money to foundation.<br />
Blizzard will NEVER sell non-vanity pets for World of Warcraft. If they do and WoW is still over 10 million sub's I will give away all my profits the next year to charity. A.k.a never.<br />
<br />
There was a blue post for reason why no pet this year. 4 year anniversary was launch of Wrath PLUS achievement system. 5 year anniversary was a milestone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So your trying to tell me the new pet falling on the same day as the 6 year anniversary isn't somehow connected, and blizzard arn't trying to sponge more money off people instead of doing the nicer thing and give us an ingame pet? Cheap, and nasty, sorry.</div></div><hr />

Why not put the pet in game and make a cool achievement that you have to do to get the pets. No that would probably be to hard like putting out a game on patch day with no bugs so that the ppl that pay 14.99 a month to you guys can actually say that it was worth it.

You don't understand because your comparison is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Gold buying has a real effect on the economy. Whether minimal or large. And there are plenty of other reasons, but I'd tell you just to just go take an elementary economics lesson.<br />
<br />
Buying vanity mini pets affects the game in absolutely no way aside from offending people like you.</div></div><hr />

For every person that says &quot;Oh, I wasn't really interested in the pet, but since it's for a good cause...&quot; that's another $5 in their pocket and another $5 they can write off their taxes.<br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't 'giving' any money away. The increase in sales by using the charity as a lure along with the tax-write off will likely net them more money than if they had just sold the pet flat out.<br />
<br />
Last time I checked, using charity organizations to make a buck at the very least fell under 'morally ambiguous'.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard isn't 'giving' any money away. The increase in sales by using the charity as a lure along with the tax-write off will likely net them more money than if they had just sold the pet flat out.<br />
<br />
Last time I checked, using charity organizations to make a buck at the very least fell under 'morally ambiguous'.<br />
<br />
This is kinda what i am thinking as well. i mean it's just 5 more bucks, why not not give all the proceeds from the hatchling to charity and keep the ones from the lil' Rag? You can't possibly tell me that they will make a loss giving it away for free. Its not a physical commodity that costs resources for every additional one they produce, so why not just give all the proceeds from this one pet to charity. Is getting twice as much goodwill a bad thing?<br />
<br />
I am not stupid enough to tell people not to buy these pets. At the end of the day it's their hard earned money and they should do whatever they want with it. It's just that, Blizzard go above and beyond when it comes to the quality and polish of their games, and so it's a little hard for me to see that they can't do the same when it comes to charity.</div></div><hr />

Jesus Christ! Wth are you guys paying for pets specially when you are already paying monthly for the game itself? Everything should be included in the $15/Month but because of retarded people(ones paying for pets) like you they are getting encouraged to make stores like pet store to make/rip more money from people. But yeah those who buy pets from the store are probably going to say, &quot;You don't make any sense&quot; because obviously they are retarded. Hopefully because of you guys they will start selling weapons/armors soon.<br />
<br />
FLAME ON!<br />
You might be flamed, yes. Not because of your opinion, you're entitled to think whatever you want, but because of the way you present it. Why do you feel the need to call people retards just because they make different decisions than you do? You don't want any discussion as everyone that doesn't agree with you is already a retard. Doesn't your attitude hinder you greatly in real life?<br />
<br />
I don't believe everything Blizzard can and will make should be included in the monthly fee. These vanity items are optional, extra products, why not sell them separately? I like collecting pets and I make enough money to buy whatever I want, so yes, I buy them. I don't believe buying vanity pets (or mounts) will every lead to Blizzard selling gear and stuff, but if it does, I will not buy those items that cross the line. I might even quit when they cross the line, but I see no reason to not buy something (or quit) before they are even close to the line.<br />
<br />
Also, they don't rip money from people. You are completely free in your decision, no one is forcing you to buy any of the items. They have no ingame advantage (or do you need a walking camp-fire for min/maxing nowadays?).</div></div><hr />

wrong.<br />

first, theres already gold sellers out there so if you want you can buy the gold and blizzard wont even ban you for doing so, even if they do find out.<br />

second, if blizzard did sell the gold, then the account hackings will stop since blizzard doesnt need to hack accounts to make gold.<br />

so yea i beleive that if no one really buys them theyll either start implementing them for free or they will just use those &quot;designers&quot; to do something else that will probably not cost you a penny. (designers between brackets because changing the size of an already existing model cant really be that hard)<br />

also, as it did happen with lil xt, you guys will probably use them the first few days and then never again. how often do you see lil xt now? only excuse imo is if youre a collectionist or whatever<br />

I hope that one day you have a child with a serious illness and won't live until they're an adult and want to make their last few years on this planet special, you'll then find out how much the make-a-wish foundation does to make that child's last years memorable, a holiday of a life time or visiting somewhere that they always want to go and the parents not able to afford it... There is so much work that make-a-wish does, calling companies, begging then, etc... You use the word &quot;retard&quot; to make you look all big and tough, well you're just a little boy that has no grasp on the concept of what it actually means to some people. I will gladly buy all the pets that blizz give 50% towards a charity that does so much regardless of what you or anyone thinks about it. If more companies did this sort of charity work then there would be so many more children that are suffering and won't live long that would have a life time of memories in their short life.</div></div><hr />

I refer you to the article linked below. As an added bonus for Blizzard, who spent next to nothing creating these virtual pixels, because the donation will be made in their name and not yours they will get a significant tax write off over and above the millions of dollars they make themselves.<br />
<br />
Compare and contrast the Blizzard offer to Yoko Ono's donation of ALL the proceeds from iTune sales of John Lennon's Give Peace a chance to the United Nations until the end of the year if you want to &quot;measure&quot; the scale of Blizzard's generosity.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard were truly motivated by Charity they would voluntarily donate to a variety of charities and/or Champion a particular cause and create a program to promote giving to charities using their vast customer base similar to Ronald McDonald houses which are sponsored by the company as well as individual donations at franchises or any other countless examples.<br />
<br />
While this &quot;offer&quot; is without a doubt a good deal for the Children's Wish Foundation if you think Blizzard's main motivation is charitable giving I have some swamp land in Florida to sell you.<br />
<br />
http://abcnews.go.com/Business/story?id=4022433&amp;page=1<br />
<br />
This article is primarily about the &quot;Buy a pink iPod and .00001% of your purchase goes to Breast Cancer Awareness!&quot; sort of deals. Blizzard are donating 50% of the proceeds (not &quot;profit&quot;, proceeds), that's substantial. I think they donated over 3 million dollars last year. A little bit of math tells me that $3 million at $5 a unit is 600,000 units. I really doubt that they sold an extra 600,000 unit just based on the &quot;charity&quot; angle. Yes, when companies donate 1 or 2 percent of an item's purchase price to charity they're often doing it just to increase sales. Rarely will a company offer to donate 50% of the purchase price for that purpose. It means that they would have to sell twice as many of the item to make up the difference. When you're talking about a 50% donation, you're looking at either a) a legitimate desire to do some good, or b) a company with a bad rep trying to get good press. Given that Blizzard has done a lot of work with Make-a-Wish in the past (Ashes of Al'ar was originally designed as a &quot;wish&quot; for a kid, among other things) and isn't particularity reviled, I'd guess (a).<br />
<br />
Edit to add: And Right, Blizzard has totally given up on free in game companion pets. I mean everybody paid for those scary as Hell Sunflowers that I see *everywhere* right now, right? Or the cute little grub pet I just got on my new Shaman Alt? Blizzard hates us now and never releases anything. You're right.</div></div><hr />

Except they're not taking things out of the game to be sold on Blizz Store, they're adding new things. To use your anology, they would still offer Crab Ragoons and Egg Rolls in the game, but a special chicken chow mein would be offered on a side table, for an extra fee, but 50% of that extra fee goes to charity.</div></div><hr />

This argument has been made before and continues to be bullshit. It's quite typical for buffet restaurants to offer all you can eat from the buffet, but also allow you to order ala carte items that are separately charged. Typically these ala carte items are alcoholic beverages or up-sell desserts. Which is exactly what this is. An extra fancy desert that you can get on the side. You can totally still get desert from the buffet (Sunflowers and Grubs All New This Week!), but a few fancy ones can be gotten ala carte. Blizzard aren't taking away your crab rangoons, they're still on the buffet, but now you can get a brownie bottom pie for a few extra bucks if you want it.</div></div><hr />

If the buffet stops offering these type of food then that is fine. Blizzard have NOT stopped offering anything, they just sell additional products. <br />
<br />
For most buffets you still have to pay separately for drinks and possible other things. In most restaurants they may also limit you what you can include in the buffet as well. So your example is invalid and does not show a point at all.<br />
<br />
If this Chinese buffet decided to no longer offer these things I would just eat other things instead. They have all the right in the world to charge money for their food. I am not forced to buy these egg roles or crab ragoons. Its a free country. It is NOT communism. There is not any laws preventing companies from selling new products. A lot of other companies does it. Microsoft, Apple e.t.c. <br />
<br />
And no they are not greedy for doing so. Just like any other company they try to earn as much money as possible while trying to offer the best possible service. Blizzard is NOT public service. If you think that then there is something wrong with you.</div></div><hr />

It is not shady. It's just business. So what if other MMORPGS does the same? Even if they started to sell gears or even gold they have all the right in the world to do so. It is Blizzard's game, not yours. If you don't like it (when/if it happens) then you can stop playing. Until then there is no need to complain. <br />
<br />

It's quite typical for buffet restaurants to offer all you can eat from the buffet, but also allow you to order ala carte items that are separately charged. Typically these ala carte items are alcoholic beverages or up-sell desserts. Which is exactly what this is. An extra fancy desert that you can get on the side. You can totally still get desert from the buffet (Sunflowers and Grubs All New This Week!), but a few fancy ones can be gotten ala carte. Blizzard aren't taking away your crab rangoons, they're still on the buffet, but now you can get a brownie bottom pie for a few extra bucks if you want it.<br />
Then where's this year's anniversary pet because I'm sure as heck not seeing that on the buffet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If the buffet stops offering these type of food then that is fine. Blizzard have NOT stopped offering anything, they just sell additional products.<br />
Yes... they have. <br />
<br />
<br />
And no they are not greedy for doing so. Just like any other company they try to earn as much money as possible while trying to offer the best possible service.<br />
Oh, I see now. They're not greedy, they're just trying to make as much money as they can sucker you into giving them...</div></div><hr />

There are plenty of pets added with the latest world changing patch and there is plenty more with the new expansion. They have not stopped offering pets.. as I can still see new free pets all over the place. So you are wrong. Anniversary doesn't equal new companion pet either, Blizzard have NEVER promised to give one companion pet to every player each year. So please provide proof before you tell lies.<br />
<br />
They are indeed trying to make a lot of money. So is your telephone company, your electric company, your local super market, your local Chinese restaurant, Blizzard.. etc. Please tell me why Blizzard is an exception here. I still haven't heard any reasons at all why Blizzard isn't allowed to function as any other normal company. Yet morons like you keep saying they are greedy :D</div></div><hr />

No you're not...because like most everything else even after the hotfix...it's still broken. Sigh...I'm tired of being shinny. In other news, I'm a sucker and I bought both the Moonkin and the Lil' Ragnaros. I dont care what Blizz does with the money, if they donate it, kuddos, if they pocket it whatever. I bought them because I wanted them, and I liked them. If I had any sort of issues paying for something like this, I would simply not do it.

So what if other MMORPGS does the same? Even if they started to sell gears or even gold they have all the right in the world to do so. It is Blizzard's game, not yours. If you don't like it (when/if it happens) then you can stop playing. Until then there is no need to complain. <br />

ya read the post - it cracks open the door as players will think about switching as it hits the pocket book a bit more. just stating my personal opinion as i would definitely would consider leaving if they continue down this path. paying $15 a month and for the game plus expansions is my threshold on gaming. its different for other people as many are more rabid - good for them. my spending on electronics, women, and booze is probably more than others too but to each his/her own. doesnt make me or you right or wrong.<br />
<br />
but back to the subject - yes, i dont need to buy it to play the game at this time but that line could be crossed very shortly - the celestial mount being a good example. vanity pets are just for achievements and bragging rights. i used the word shady as it seems like blizz is testing the waters as far as how far they can go with these purchased items.<br />
<br />
its called feedback buddy dont get your panties in a wad (referring to all your related posts on this subject). most companies welcome it so they have all the information to make the best decision. and unless you work for blizz, you have no idea what direction they are moving in so your thoughts on the matter carry as much weight as anyone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fine if that is your threshold for your gaming. Some people are able to spend more money than you. Just because YOU can't afford these pets does NOT mean Blizzard is doing something wrong. However you said it was shady of Blizzard doing this, so you should be prepared for someone to argue against you. <br />
<br />
Selling mounts and companion pets does not alter gameplay for anyone but for yourself. These things does not offer you any advantaged over other players. This is NOT shady. <br />
<br />
You said I have no idea what direction they are going, but you seem to think YOU know that. You are just like any other moron here then. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard decide to shut down their game completely, sell gold to their customers or just sell pets they have ALL the right in the world to do so. They are NOT breaking any laws. They are not doing something wrong. They are NOT breaking any policies. If they decide something which will cost half their player base it is their fault. It's been many years since they started selling additional things (realm transfer, faction change, pets etc) and this is NOWHERE close to selling gold/gears. Blizzard is actually going the opposite way with Cataclysm, making epics harder to get. Blizzard is stating a clear policy on buying gold and why they think it is wrong. So what are YOUR indications that they are going the way you think they are going? Please explain.</div></div><hr />

If your phone company, electric company, local supermarket, or local Chinese restaurant suddenly decided to offer less services for the same price and only offered those previously bundled services at an extra cost, you'd have the same reaction. You tell me why Blizzard is apparently the exception here.<br />
<br />
This is a clear cut example of Blizz holding back content so they can sell separately as an extra. It's a dick move. If you're okay with paying the same for less and being taken advantage of, fine, but don't pretend that this is admirable behavior.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And don't think this doesn't open the door to further game-breaking changes. Pandora's box has already been opened in that regard. There's nowhere to go from here but down. Blizzard will continue to withhold more and more game content until they find out where the breaking point is in their player base.<br />

Blizzard is not offering less services for the monthly subscription. You are paying for access to the game. Nothing else. Nada. Nothing. Please tell me where you pay your 15 dollars to get extra pets? You don't. So your comparison is invalid.<br />

They released 4.0.1 and 4.03 without any charge. That is their BIGGEST patch so far. How on earth is that holding back content? They changed the whole bloody world lol. How are we getting less because they sell two pets in their store? We are getting MORE now than we EVER have. Can you tell me any patch bigger in content than the world-changing patch? Please direct me to that patch. <br />

Yeah cause their last two patches only gave thousands of quests, models and item rewards.. and now you are moaning about two companion pets? Please don't lie. Blizzard is not holding back on anything. If they were holding back on stuff they wouldn't change all the low level zones. If that is holding back then I don't know what you really want from patches.<br />

4th Question on WoW's general FAQ...<br />
<br />
&quot;Why isn't World of Warcraft free?<br />
The fee is used to support the costs associated with the high-quality levels of service, support, and ongoing content creation that go into World of Warcraft.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
They released 4.0.1 and 4.03 without any charge.<br />
I got charged for it. I get charged for it every month. I'm also going to get charged for it when I buy the expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is their BIGGEST patch so far. How on earth is that holding back content?<br />
Because they decided to put the 6th Anniversary Pet in the store instead of in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Yeah cause their last two patches only gave thousands of quests, models and item rewards.. and now you are moaning about two companion pets? Please don't lie. Blizzard is not holding back on anything.<br />

<br />
<br />
If they were holding back on stuff they wouldn't change all the low level zones. If that is holding back then I don't know what you really want from patches. Everything I expect and more. That's what I want.<br />
If I don't offer that to my customers, I consider that a failure on my part. Blizzard should feel the same.<br />

Good. On my server, which (to my knowledge) is not a high population server, there were many, many people spamming that crap all over Orgrimmar. In the AH, in the Bank, in front of Garrosh's throne room.<br />
<br />
And why? To be obnoxious, because, for those of us that play with sound on, it was quite obnoxious.<br />
<br />
Luckily, folks like me, reported it for griefing and Blizz fixed it so you could no longer do so.<br />

Let me tell you something, lets use Calene's example agian, if you are unsatisfied with your supermarket, restaurant, instead of bitching you find another. Very simple, if you are so damm angry about not getting your pet (even tho if I may say you are NOT entitled to it), leave this game, go play the super Aion or whatever. <br />
<br />
You see mate, it might been an expectation to get a pet, heck even I hoped for it. But you know what I didn't get it, instead I enjoyed this lovely world shattering we've got for free. Which you wont pay for (In Catac you pay for 80-85 content and proffesions to make it clear to you). <br />
<br />
Yes you get charged for this game, know why? its a monthly subscripion game, if you did get your pet know what? You would still pay, invalid argument.<br />
<br />
Let me ask this, who ever sayd the 6 years Anniversary, is supposted to be the one in the pet shop? It did get released on the same day as we got our achievement, but hey this date the 30th is not the date wow was released, maybe they are not meant to be the 6 years Anniversary. Just saying.<br />
<br />
Content? You got the whole damm shattering, and bitching about the pet (still?). Yes you did not get the pet this year, agian who ever told you that you would? Oh I see no one. Also the content you got last year was the Onyxia redone for content filler, something they did for your cause extra. It is not a tradition to give you a pet, please stop filling everybody up with bullshit. However if you want a pet, go buy one, I wont. And mate if you wont, well no pet really, otherwise go complete PvG (To be honest the most flavourable thing they've given us, for what? FUN, yeah thats right).<br />
<br />
If you didn't get everything you expected, maybe its time to move on. Warhammer Online, Aion awaits! I'm happy as hell for the shattering, and I will enjoy Cataclysm once I buy it (will be later some time after release tho). Blizzard wants money, they give out content which all seem to bitch about, I ask to myself why the hell is there so many active subscribers? Oh thats right, WoW is the best MMORPG, they must do something right. Agian just saying mate.<br />
<br />
Is it okay morally and legaly to not give you the damm pet? Yes, want me to list up all the flavour things we have gotten just this patch? I can do that for you if you like.<br />
<br />
Shortened: You are unhappy about a pet, you bitch about it. So what? If that pet breaks your game and if the shattering is so useless and rubbish for you. Well I'm sorry, I'd guess you have to leave this game, really. <br />
<br />
I'm no Blizzard fan, they do many things wrong, agian I can list up some of the critic mistakes, but I wont listen to useless shit, you deem no right for that pet whatsoever.<br />

Blizzard is incredibly stupid to not have done that. They could have avoided this entire scenario.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Blizzard created an expectation for content.<br />
Blizzard failed to deliver said content.<br />
Blizzard did so in the worst way possible with the timing of their bull!@#$ petstore pets.<br />

<br />
So Blizzard doesn't charge you every month?<br />
<br />
No... wanting to get what I pay for is a pretty tried and true stance.<br />
<br />
Nobody, it's just incredibly poor timing on Blizz's part to add two new pets to the store at the exact same time they decided to NOT add a new pet to the game.<br />
<br />
That pretty much sums it up, yes.<br />
<br />
Blizzard freely admits they set up that expectation.<br />
<br />
Two consecutive years makes it a tradition.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much the sum of it.<br />
<br />
You know, I never thought of it that way.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is incredibly stupid to not have done that. They could have avoided this entire scenario.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's the long and short of it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard created an expectation for content.<br />
Blizzard failed to deliver said content.<br />
Blizzard did so in the worst way possible with the timing of their bull!@#$ petstore pets.<br />
<br />

<br />
You did leave some of my arguments out of your response, none the less.<br />
<br />
Yes you get charged to pay, you dont get charged for the free things you get for flavour.<br />
<br />
Two years makes it a tradition? Really so, thats your thought.<br />
<br />
Yes they admit its an expectation and they did not give it to us this year, agian you are not entitled to get free pets just because its another anniversary.<br />
<br />
Go play PvG and get the pet there, for me its something unique they have no reason to make. They did that only for fun to us, and even included a pet.<br />
<br />
I do agree its stupid to go on the same day and be like: hey buy theese pets, for monehz! But really, its just an offer and have nothing to do with this anniversary. Take it or leave it.<br />
The anniversary is not tied to pet shop in any way I just wanna remark. Also your only arguments is just that its a tradition to give us pets. To the hell it aint, want pets go complete PvG, or go to EPL or Darkshire, or even buy them.</div></div><hr />

Most awesome pet ever, and I'm sad to say it, but he's replacing the pandaren pet as my trusty companion in raids.<br />
To those that keep crying about an anniversary pet; it doesn't help. Honestly. At some point you'll have to get over the fact that you didn't get something free.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps, but I'd assume Blizzard is smart enough to that if they started selling items that impact the game that they'd lose subs. While I won't pretend to know how many that would be, I don't see it being a gamble Blizzard would be willing to make.</div></div><hr />

If they were a buck or two, then I would totally get both of them.</div></div><hr />
