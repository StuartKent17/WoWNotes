Legion - Shaman Tier 19 Armor Sets<br />
The latest Legion build added most of the Shaman Tier 19 sets. There is a normal Fel color variant that is currently missing some models and it is not included here.<br />

Tank &amp; Healer Ability Tuning<br />
Are encounters going to be tuned to have longer time-to-kill for tanks as well?<br />
<br />
I ask because in a world where tanks need to be actively healed, dying so quickly that they must be spammed all of the time (read: less than 3 or 4 seconds for 100-0) just leads to a WotLK situation where one person gets to spam the tank forever and everyone else ignores it and nothing is really any different.<br />
Absolutely, yes. It's very important that this is the case.<br />
<br />
I'd like to note that &quot;use Active Mitigation to avoid X ability&quot; isn't usually engaging gameplay. How about I use AM because it helps me survive a powerful attack, not because I get a debuff if I don't.<br />
Binary AM checks like you mention will continue to be extremely rare. They're still an interesting mechanic to see everyone once in a while, but will not be common. Sorry if what I said gave the impression otherwise.

New Logging Feature: COMBATANT_INFO<br />
Cool, yeah most bonus IDs should be relatively easy to determine from the item level. The only bonuses that would be tricky are things like stat variations on e.g. crafted or baleful items, and bonus minor stats on items. Using the stats you could determine that they have e.g. ~3 items with movement speed... but you wouldn't really know how much and on which items.<br />
<br />
You shouldn't need any guessing. Random tertiaries and sockets are a great point about being missing; I'll follow up on that. You really should have everything you need to reconstruct their gear.

Classic Realms<br />
Tom Chilton (Game Director for World of Warcraft) answered a question about classic servers during the BlizzCon 2015 World of Warcraft Q&amp;A.<br />
<br />
While we realise there is a desire for servers running previous versions of the game, we do not have any plans to setup classic servers. The old code is designed to run on the old hardware. The old code brings with it the old data, which includes the old bugs. The natural expectation from players would be that we would fix these bugs to ensure a smooth gameplay experience (along with the need for Customer Support and other dedicated support teams for such realms).<br />
<br />
We feel it is not feasible to support multiple versions of World of Warcraft concurrently, and instead believe that our resources would be better placed continuing to build upon the current live game.

the lovely folk at @BlizzardCS tell me that you are the ones to talk to for getting a tabard locker for my 50+ tabards?<br />
Tabards are included in the #Legion Transmog improvements, so you have a lot of free closet space in your future! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/686748515494580224))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What's your opinion on limited-access forums readable to public? Example: Master+ and Devs only, readable by public.<br />
It greatly helps to problem of player to dev ratio being so skewed. Just have to avoid whiff of elitism. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687038131846000640))<br />

Legion - Kobolds<br />
You will encounter the Kobolds again in Legion and learn a little bit about their history!<br />
Kobolds live here long time. Make home in nooks.<br />
Catch rats. Sometimes eat them.<br />
Dig for treasure. Trade with harpies.<br />
They like shinies, we like wax. Fresh from ears is best.<br />
One day drogbar come in. Say cave is theirs.<br />
They smash and scare. We take candles and hide.<br />
Drogbar big and stupid. They have cave, but no have candle.<br />
Darkness finds them. Darkness follows them.<br />
Darkness swallows them whole!<br />
We come back. We have candles.<br />
Cave ours again. Candles keep us safe.<br />

Now, whether or not you get things like the achievement for doing Ulduar in X item level at level 80... it'd be nice to see that implemented, I guess, but I know a lot of people would complain about all the time they had to put in to get their gear, etc.</div></div><hr />

And then whatever crap the LFR/honor set will look like. That's a rather strange decision and I'm shocked other classes aren't complaining they don't get a third version. Why the shaman favoritism with the tier? (I do main a shaman and even I find this unfair to other classes. Personally, I also dislike the look. If I wanted to have a molten look, I'd wear T5. And I HATE SKIRTS! Shoulders also remind me of the paladin T8 from Ulduar in a way.)<br />
<br />
The kobold thing is cute. Read the dialogue expecting it to be a bit more poetic, though. Failed in that regard, but still interesting. Begs the question what's in the darkness that swallowed up the drogbar because they didn't have a candle. Makes me think of other RPGs where you step into the darkness and have a chance to get eaten by some random dark critter. Saw pictures of the quests that make you a quest giver for the kobolds which is a good laugh. Sad Blizzard hasn't done that since Cata with Into the Machine.<br />
<br />
The statement regarding vanilla servers, while much more recent than other statements, still won't let that topic die. Only way for it to die is for Blizzard to finally release that server, leave it as it was (bugs, instability, etc intact for that vanilla experience), and see how fast people run back to current servers. Only way for people to finally shut up on the topic is to prove it would fail (or succeed) by doing it. Perhaps to cover the initial setup and maintenance fees to get it back up, they ask players if they want to play on a vanilla server and charge them $5-10 extra a month to play on it. They should also keep a live update on the population currently active on the server so people can either marvel that it's actually working or laugh maniacally when it drops to like 20 people. Blizzard can treat the server like tournament realms so you can only get on one if you're flagged to do so (and are thus paying for it). Not like the server has to have new content on it or need class balancing. People want the vanilla experience. So that saves on costs there. Then of course because people want the vanilla experience, no sense fixing the bugs or even stability issues that took the servers down from time to time so that saves on more costs. All Blizzard would really be paying for would be an old server to handle the old code and someone to reboot it when it goes down. Charging players $5-10 extra a month just to play on it would result in Blizzard making a ton of cash for little work. (Personally, I find vanilla servers stupid, but if the topic won't die, may as well prove it will either fail or succeed by doing it.)</div></div><hr />

Sounds good on paper, put read their statement again - it would take too much manpower and resources to do it - even to prove a point. It's not just a money question, it's taking devs and engineers off the current projects to do it. You can't just wave a magic wand, and have 100 new workers appear in their cubicles. To do what you propose is literally making a new title - which means the people to make it, and the people to support it. $5 extra? I think it would take a little more than that, just to cover the cost of rewriting the old game code to work on modern servers - that's a LOT of work, it's not a couple lines of code, run an installer, and you're good to go. Then you need to support it. It's literally a new game, and it will need it's own internal division inside the company to run it. <br />
<br />
The reality is, the people still demanding vanilla servers need to accept &quot;No&quot; as an answer. They've been told that consistently. Blizzard doesn't need to prove anything, they can say &quot;No&quot; for any reason at all.</div></div><hr />

The people demanding vanilla servers don't need to accept any answer other than yes, it doesn't hurt to keep badgering them about it.<br />

Makes me think of a child asking their parent for a Dog, the parent knows it's a lot of effort for a stupid mutt so outlines exactly why the child shouldn't get a dog. But the child wants a dog so keeps asking for one, and occasionally plays with a stray dog (private server) until the parent makes them stop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All in all, though a well designed set. My only complaint would be the leathery look to the helm, that feels out of place with the rest of it.<br />
<br />
I always felt like each tier should have a specific class spec theme, and this tier hits it all for shaman. I only wish every class would have this. Granted paladins have a cohesive theme through all 3 specs, but mages, death knights, druids, warlocks and even monks have a varied look and 'fantasy' for each spec, and it is rare that even one spec is addressed in a tier, much less all three.</div></div><hr />

I think they are trying to figure out how to do this with the Broken Isles, where you can quest in any zone, and the mobs will match your lvl. I don't know how much of a pain it would be to recode all of the old zones to work this way, but there could be a day where you could lvl to 110 off of killing boars in the woods of Elwynn Forest to avoid the Lifeless.</div></div><hr />

Makes me think of a child asking their parent for a Dog, the parent knows it's a lot of effort for a stupid mutt so outlines exactly why the child shouldn't get a dog. But the child wants a dog so keeps asking for one, and occasionally plays with a stray dog (private server) until the parent makes them stop.<br />
<br />
Or better yet learn to accept that you are not going to get everything you want.. All I see when you have people going on and on about wanting classic servers is like that two year old throwing a tantrum on the supermarket floor because they are not getting their favourite candy..<br />

I'm not sure how much more clearly Blizzard has to say &quot;WE are not interested in supporting vanilla servers, and don't care if other people do&quot; without *actually* saying it which would be trademark suicide.<br />
<br />
Geez, people, does he have to spell it out?<br />
<br />
This has been their answer EVERY time they're asked, unequivocally. And they clearly are not legally pursuing vanilla servers that don't make a big deal about it or attempt to compete with Bilzzard commercially.<br />
<br />
Apparently subtlety escapes the internet.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this seems to be how it is no matter how plainly Blizzard put it, some people are still too stupid, arrogant and idiotic to realize that it is not going to happen..</div></div><hr />

Also, I really wish I could like the head piece for the set, but... antlers? Antlers? ಠ_ಠ<br />
<br />
<br />
To see how blizzard do some really nice gear now but only Mythic raiders and hardcore raiders get s it <br />
I dont raid cause I cant I pvp but since WoD they give shitty skin armor to Lfr and you nees to be high Rated to get skin change for arena ...but actualy you cant get them if you dont have hardcore pvp team ....in vanilla everything was balance .</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">voskopoula</div><div class="date">2016-01-17, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So shamans get 3 versions of their tier (still with 6 recolors since 1 is missing right now) while everyone else gets 2? And then whatever crap the LFR/honor set will look like. That's a rather strange decision and I'm shocked other classes aren't complaining they don't get a third version. Why the shaman favoritism with the tier? (I do main a shaman and even I find this unfair to other classes. Personally, I also dislike the look. If I wanted to have a molten look, I'd wear T5. And I HATE SKIRTS! Shoulders also remind me of the paladin T8 from Ulduar in a way.)<br />
<br />
The kobold thing is cute. Read the dialogue expecting it to be a bit more poetic, though. Failed in that regard, but still interesting. Begs the question what's in the darkness that swallowed up the drogbar because they didn't have a candle. Makes me think of other RPGs where you step into the darkness and have a chance to get eaten by some random dark critter. Saw pictures of the quests that make you a quest giver for the kobolds which is a good laugh. Sad Blizzard hasn't done that since Cata with Into the Machine.<br />
<br />
The statement regarding vanilla servers, while much more recent than other statements, still won't let that topic die. Only way for it to die is for Blizzard to finally release that server, leave it as it was (bugs, instability, etc intact for that vanilla experience), and see how fast people run back to current servers. Only way for people to finally shut up on the topic is to prove it would fail (or succeed) by doing it. Perhaps to cover the initial setup and maintenance fees to get it back up, they ask players if they want to play on a vanilla server and charge them $5-10 extra a month to play on it. They should also keep a live update on the population currently active on the server so people can either marvel that it's actually working or laugh maniacally when it drops to like 20 people. Blizzard can treat the server like tournament realms so you can only get on one if you're flagged to do so (and are thus paying for it). Not like the server has to have new content on it or need class balancing. People want the vanilla experience. So that saves on costs there. Then of course because people want the vanilla experience, no sense fixing the bugs or even stability issues that took the servers down from time to time so that saves on more costs. All Blizzard would really be paying for would be an old server to handle the old code and someone to reboot it when it goes down. Charging players $5-10 extra a month just to play on it would result in Blizzard making a ton of cash for little work. (Personally, I find vanilla servers stupid, but if the topic won't die, may as well prove it will either fail or succeed by doing it.)<br />

Well perhaps it was easier to recolor change some effects of the shaman set and most possibly the rest of the set recolors are not ready for the other classes. I expect hybrids to have that many tier set recolors and designs compared to rogues for example, to show the change in the raid role the least to say.<br />
<br />
However the most important thing is, did you guys check the enhancement in legion alpha?<br />
<br />
At the moment flametongue seems bugged, 25days cd lol.<br />
The energy resource isnt hthat terrible to casualy play enha, but i guess you need perfection later on in raids. I cant comment on the damage as it is not tweaked etc by blizzard yet, but if you want to level up in there, for me the best and most maelstrom resource and often burst spec is the following.<br />
<br />
http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Cple<br />
<br />
High maelstrom regeneration every minute (with Spiritual Resonance and Spiritual Affinity), accompany it with the doomhammer skill and its a pew pew situation.<br />
Gust of wind because the feral lunge doesnt seem to work, not sure.<br />
10% haste and attack speed is super awesome at low lvl gear <br />
Fury of Air, the best aoe talent at this moment, super crazy damage , just gather 3-4 mobs, throw a capacitor totem (lightning surge totem) and use that and stormstrike and crash lightinig. bb<br />
Ascendance , by far the best at 100lvl talent row, crazy damage and if you accompany it with spiritual resonance and affinity, well, you do at least 15seconds of non stop crazy damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would bet the ice ones are the normal ones for their respective tiers (Normal/heroic for PVE and non elite for PvP) and the fire ones the mythic/elite ones. As for the one on the right? Probably lfr.</div></div><hr />

When no one was looking, Lex Luthor took forty candles. He took 40 candles. That's as many as four tens. And that's terrible.</div></div><hr />
