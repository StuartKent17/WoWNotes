Grevious Gladiator is 5.4s arena season. Prideful will presumably be 5.5 or 5.6.</div></div><hr />

My only issue right now is that our current 2p will be amazing with the new talent and currentlyand when the t16 4p looks to be very lacking a lot of people might stick with the current 2p. However the gear jump next tier is huge but I am note sure its enough to drop the current 2p and we all know blizzard is not a fan of leaving amazing past tier bonuses untoched</div></div><hr />

When have blizzard ever said 5.4 will be last? I don't recall having seen it.<br />
<br />
Would honestly make sense to let it keep going on, since there's things that need to be fixed, even when garrosh dies, unless you want to have a full new expansion starting with fixing ogrimmar, new warchief etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New seasons come with new tiers, 5.4 is the last major tier as stated by them before launch and clarified a couple of times during. Pretty sure just because you haven't seen it doesn't mean they didn't say it. I'm sure google could help you out.</div></div><hr />

They said Garrosh would be the final boss way back near Blizzcon/launch which makes this the last Tier, at least. However, they can always pull a Halion (albeit, that was not Tier).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since a lot of the other items seem to be timeless isle items Im guessing it will have to do with that. Maybe a random drop. <br />
<br />
That wrathion audio log makes it sound as if the whole turmoil that he was talking about when you first get to lvl 90 and complete some of his questline in the near future is him trying to get the the horde or alliance to have world domination and not so much trying to stop something big from destroying everything. Also he was cryptic and now he has a low attention span like this major devastating thing isnt really all that major.</div></div><hr />

Disclaimer and all. That said, all I can say about this tier set is &quot;what is this, I don't even...&quot; Seriously, anyone have a clue what the idea/theme/whatever is supposed to be here? 'Cause I'm not seeing it and it seems that I'll be farming the PvP version once 5.4 is out.<br />

Item - Shaman T16 Restoration 2P Bonus (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/145378/#17153-17169) When Earth Shield heals a target, the target will gain 100% 300% of the amount healed as an absorb.<br />
Much less lol-worthy, thank goodness. Still doesn't change the problem that absorbs have become this expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, they can always pull a Halion (albeit, that was not Tier).<br />

Also, I love everything about that Wrathion audio. Everything. So perfect. If anyone thought that Wrathion wasn't playing both sides, they're fools. I just didn't expect that his plan was for the Alliance to completely conquer the Horde. (nevah!) But it's such a black dragon move, I don't know why I didn't see it. (&quot;like Auntie Onyxia&quot;! &lt;3) I love how he loses his cool and throws a tantrum. Then when he gets great wisdom from the previously silent Tong, &quot;You are just a waiter!&quot; I literally barked out a laugh so loud it woke my roommate from two rooms away. And then to top it off with Tong, &quot;He left no tip. He is not nice.&quot; Oh my god, I think I died.</div></div><hr />

Actually, that should be done in co-existence with player housing. Buy your own Hearthstone game board and put it in your house and you and whoever else is in your house can play against each other. (whenever Player Housing hits WoW, ofc.)</div></div><hr />

Archimonde's Vengeance was reworked: Each time you or your pet take damage, you gain 1% of the unmitigated damage taken as spell power for 20 sec.<br />
<br />
1% of damage taken converted into spell power and it probably stacks ?<br />
The more you hit a warlock the more damage he does?<br />

WTF that's OP both in PvP and in PvE.<br />

Not only the christmas and Ascend-a-Friend ones (which were the first one), Rift got corgis (about four different ones) in its store and corgi NPCs because it's like an community/staff joke. Almost every new event brings a special corgi as pet reward and the playerbase likes them so much they requested a corgi mount - the staff laughed and said it could be done soon.</div></div><hr />

The 5 second cast part is the cast time to apply the tinker to the belt. The tinker itself is probably instant.</div></div><hr />
