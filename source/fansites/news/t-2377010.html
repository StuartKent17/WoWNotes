Hunter Pets in Battle for Azeroth<br />
As we’ve kicked off the Battle for Azeroth Alpha, we’ve seen a lot of discussion about the new way Hunter pets work. While we’re by no means finished, we have reached a place where we want to share some insight into our plans and explain some of what you might see in development as Alpha continues.<br />
<br />
Our primary thoughts on pets going forward:<br />
<br />
<br />
Move past the idea of a DPS/Tank pet specialization - In Battle for Azeroth, all pets will have equal damage, health, and armor. All can tank or DPS equally. Choosing to put a particular pet into “Tank spec” feels outdated, so we’re going to shift all pets to a setup that will work as though they’re specced into both Ferocity and Tenacity (in Legion terms). All offensive and defensive passive abilities such as Blood of the Rhino and Combat Training will be rolled into every pet by default. Charge will be removed, and all pets will have Growl and Dash/Swoop. Some spec-specific actives will be redistributed where appropriate. We are keeping the names Ferocity, Tenacity, and Cunning as the broad groups that all families fall into. They are no longer changeable, and each has a new passive and active ability that are useful in almost any situation. <br />
<br />
Maintain and/or reinstate pet family uniqueness - Pet family flavor is part of what makes selecting a companion unique and special, and want to emphasize that even more. A special ability has been added to all pet families that were missing one. Exotic Pets still have their unique ability (like Surface Trot) in addition to a new ability. Pure flavor abilities that many pets have are also staying like Trick (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/94022-trick) and Rest (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/94019-rest).<br />
<br />
Expanding access to Bloodlust, and the removal of Battle Res from pets - In Legion, all Hunters have access to Bloodlust and Battle Res, but they only exist among a handful of families, which leads to very narrow options. To that end, Bloodlust will be available on roughly a third of the tamable pet families rather than just two. In a world where we are proliferating abilities to many families, our first inclination was to add Battle Res to a separate third of those families. After seeing that landscape, it felt odd to fully embrace Resurrection as part of the Hunter kit. Further, moving into Battle for Azeroth, we are solidifying Bloodlust and Battle Res as the strong shared cooldowns that a group can bring - one offense, one defense. In that world, Hunters having access to both of the super powerful group benefits didn’t feel appropriate. <br />
<br />
A variety of pet ability packages - It’s important to acknowledge that some hunters want to maximize their impact with their pet, while others are collectors who want a pet for every occasion. There should be opportunities to cleverly swap from one pet to another in a given situation and reap the benefit. At the same time, the Hunter who has grown attached to their spider named Fluffy should feel effective across the game. We’re going to try to ensure that every pet package is attractive, with a unique combination of benefits that work in many situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are some specifics of the Battle for Azeroth design for Hunter pets:<br />
<br />
There are currently 51 pet families, and each family will be categorized as Ferocity, Tenacity, or Cunning. Each will have an active and a passive, and the active will be a Hunter class button that changes contextually with your active pet. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ferocity<br />
Primal Rage (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/264667-primal-rage) (Active - Bloodlust) Predator’s Thirst (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/264663-predators-thirst) (Passive - 3% Leech for you and your pet)<br />
Tenacity<br />
Survival of the Fittest (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/264735-survival-of-the-fittest) (Active - 20% damage reduction for the Hunter and Pet for 6 seconds with a 3 minute cooldown) Endurance Training (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/264662-endurance-training) (Passive - 10% max health for you and your pet)<br />
Cunning<br />
Master’s Call (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/53271-masters-call) (Active – a friendly target and your pet are immune to root and moment impairing effects for 4 seconds with a 45 second cooldown) Pathfinding (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/264656-pathfinding) (Passive - 8% movement speed for you and your pet)<br />
<br />
Each pet family will get one of six different abilities, and each ability will have a unique name themed to the family. Precedented abilities such as Ankle Crack (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/50433-ankle-crack) - 50% Snare, Monstrous Bite (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/54680-monstrous-bite) - Healing Reduction Debuff, Shell Shield (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/26064-shell-shield) – 50% Reduced Damage Taken, Agile Reflexes (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/160011-agile-reflexes) - 30% Dodge, and Thick Hide (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/160057-thick-hide) – Reduced Damage Taken at Low Health already exist in the game, and we’re exploring adding something similar to Tranquilizing Shot (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/19801-tranquilizing-shot) to the list.<br />
<br />
While this does create a landscape where there may only be a handful of families that exactly fit the combination of tools you prefer, each family was chosen with variety as a premium. There are winged creatures, predators, grazers, and more represented across as many abilities as possible, while keeping them thematically appropriate. <br />
<br />
For two specific examples: a Spirit Beast in Battle for Azeroth still has Spirit Mend (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/90361-spirit-mend) and Spirit Walk (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/90328-spirit-walk), and will gain Endurance Training (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/264662-endurance-training) and Survival of the Fittest (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/264735-survival-of-the-fittest). They also have a new ability, Spirit Shock (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/264265-spirit-shock), that dispels magic and soothes enraged enemies. Cats, on the other hand, gain Catlike Reflexes (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/263892-catlike-reflexes) – a 30% dodge cooldown – in addition to Primal Rage (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/264667-primal-rage) and Predator’s Thirst (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/264663-predators-thirst). Both pets have equal damage, health, and armor – both can tank or DPS equally.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, only about half of the pet families out there have a useful ability, and we want to improve on that. In Battle for Azeroth, Bloodlust will be much more prominent, so Hunters should no longer feel bound to Core Hounds and Nether Rays as their best options. Most importantly, these changes should result in a pet landscape where all pets can serve as dps or tank as well as they could in Legion.<br />
<br />
Please remember that all of the above, especially the numbers, are subject to change as we test in the Battle for Azeroth Alpha. Feel free to discuss anything related to Hunter pets here. We really appreciate your feedback!<br />

Mobile/Web Auction House Disabled in 7.3.5<br />
Just letting you all know that we are working on a hotfix at the moment to re-enable the Web and Mobile AH. <br />
<br />
Due to changes made in 7.3.5, players will be need to have logged in to the game since the patch launch in order to be able to access the Mobile AH once this hotfix is live. Just for some additional clarity, these database changes were why we disabled the tools on the launch of 7.3.5 and why it took us a little bit to update them.<br />
<br />
Soon as I'm aware that this is live I'll update the thread.</div></div><hr />

I guess you either did not read the or did not understand the post. A third (1/3) of the pet families will have bloodlust, only spirit beat will have dispel and no pet will have battle res.</div></div><hr />

So the choice in legion is: Quillen/Crane/Moth (and in very rare occasions a Nether ray/Core hound)<br />

What are you talking about? ALL ferocity pets will have access to Bloodlust, so if you want it, you can pick like a cat or raptor.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaver</div><div class="date">2018-02-14, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BM hunters are currently way too complex. We need to have the pet doing 99 % of the damage and auto attack should be the only ability! Also the pet should automatically evaluate when to use Bloodlust cause otherwise I would have to actually activate my brain and ain’t nobody got time for that!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that it would not be that much cosmetic, since specific pet families will get specific skills. You will have a broader choice for each skill, but if you want to have that, you will have to use some pet from that family.</div></div><hr />

Once you los the caster, the dots/hots expire, you can even drop combat. You can't do the same with pets when the hunter is in range and doesn't cancel pet attack. Your argument is invalid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be mandatory to bring a shaman to every single group. It hurts small groups the most, aka M+. A shaman spot should be reserved every single time you start any kind of group.<br />
<br />
Back in the days, when BL was only a shaman thing, the game was not so sophisticated, only one kind of competitive pve group content existed (raids).<br />
<br />
Now we have timers to beat, every single % of dps to squeeze out of the group and a BL ability is must.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bl should be back to sham only<br />
<br />
Again, bloodlust is already baseline, if you want call it that, for hunter. And it is not the same. Lust is basically mandatory ability for any pve group content. There is no way around it. They could give it to just shaman's and it would fit somehow into &quot;bring the class, not the player&quot; philosophy..but it would be too much, wouldn't be? &quot;Bring some tank, healer, shaman and some dps&quot; .<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think they should remove lust altogether or scale it back to affect just Shaman only - or spread bloodlust to more classes. 3 for now is sufficient probably.<br />

<br />
You are clueless and just try to defend a broken mechanism that makes hunters superior in los situations. Read again: dots expire over time once you are not in los of the caster and he/she can't reapply them, also you can drop combat. You can't do the same with a hunter pet, because it follows you all the time, regardless you are in los of the hunter or not.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what do you want with running away when you are within the range of the ranged specs, ofc they can reach you - except in a los situation, where hunters still can keep up combat and attack with the pet.<br />
<br />
You can't beat this argument and you know it. So a pet should stop attacking after a few seconds, once a hunter is not in los of the target.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Calling me clueless and still not writing a single reason, why you feel it is broken system. So let's make some assumptions here too. You are so bad, that hunter sending pat at you and do nothing else will kill you. Am I right? I guess so.<br />
<br />
Look..if you want change some mechanics, you have to say why you feel it hurts the game. Hunters are not super strong in PvP and if someone will die just by pet alone, it tells more about the &quot;victim&quot; not the hunter class. Also, if hunter is just sending pet and do nothing else, it is hurting it's own team so this gameplay is pretty much worth nothing. The best use of pet you may not like is to split your dps, doing some ranged damage and let pet chase down healer or something like that. That works and you may not like it but still how it is bad for the game?<br />
<br />
Pet running back because of los would be so disconnecting for hunter player. This would actually hurt the game - it would be broken for many - because logic wouldn't just apply. &quot;Why my pet is coming back when opponent just run into that small hut&quot;? So how it works in the game makes perfect sense. Only question is, if this mechanics broken or unfair? If yes, tell me how please..<br />
<br />
Also comparing dots and pets... dots has duration, pets have health bar, you can dispel dots, which is pretty rare, you can run from pets, slow them, stun them, fear them..basically anything.. which is very common. <br />
<br />

<br />
When I made my first hunter on my main server, I managed (over the years) to tame almost all of the rare BM pets (Skoll, Arcturis, the various rare spiders in the firelands area, both spectral cats, the spectral owl, ghost crab, etc, etc).... Since those days, I've created some hunters on other servers to play with friends, but haven't even attempted to tame these guys on those other servers, mainly due to the greatly increased difficulty of finding them after the implementation of cross-realm zones, and the large number of other players who are trying to tame them. Having hunter pets become account-wide would solve that issue for a number of us players that have hunters on numerous servers, and would probably be easily done if the methods for mounts and battle pets could be duplicated for them.<br />

No, they haven't. There are TONS of PvE instances where the movement speed boost(and occasionally, the root/slow immunity) of Cunning pets is useful...in fact, outside of Bloodlust(if nobody else in your group can provide it), I can't see any reason to ever use a &quot;DPS pet&quot; over a &quot;PvP pet&quot; since their damage is going to be the same. Now, the pet family abilities could make a difference, but being a DPS pet doesn't mean they get a DPS ability anyway, since according to the Blizzard post, the cat family(a &quot;DPS family&quot; pet) gets a dodge CD as their family ability.</div></div><hr />

You compare apples and oranges and you don't want to understand the whole situation.

Sure it's nice to bring the same pet that you like the look of for every fight and never switch, but that's where it stops. I want to return to a time when a simple thing like being aware of what pets to bring was a valued contribution.

By making them EVEN MORE GENERIC?<br />
<br />
I wish hunter pets had been pushed in the opposite direction like they used to be. I want bears and turtles to be tanky by default. I want bats and snakes and birds to be PVP harrassers by default and I don't want them to be tanky too. I want there to be pure glass cannon DPS pets and some more durable reliable DPS pets. I don't suppose we need oldschool pet talent trees but I sure would like to select SOME skills for pets instead of every bear being the same and every bird being the same. Right now, pets are stat sticks and that's what they're being tuned to be even more and that's super boring. They're obligatory pets, not flavorful pets. Kinda defeats the point of being a Hunter unless your entire WoW existence is playing pretty pretty princess dressup and you have to have a kitty cat and don't want to get yelled at in a raid for having your precious kitty cat as your pet.</div></div><hr />

It toggles off automatically when entering dungeons since the beginning of Legion, these people have to be turning it back on after they get in... lol</div></div><hr />

Read again, I won't write it down again how it's an advantage to keep a player in combat and damaging it, having 100% uptime, even when there is no actual interaction between the player characters due to los situation.<br />
<br />
Show us on the doll exactly where the big, bad hunter hurt you lol.<br />
<br />
Seriously, you sound like youre just salty over some hunter handing you a PvP spanking. There are ways to mitigate that hunter specific game mechanic, use them.<br />
<br />
Next you'll argue that rogue stealth is unfair because you can't see them.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm no, the exact opposite.<br />
<br />
Actually you are required to play core hound, neither ray (BL) or crane (BR).<br />
<br />
That's the only 3 usefull pets you can have. Everything else is a subpar choice.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes hunter pets still do really weird stuff.. or walking very weird routes and end up pulling everything in their way.<br />
<br />
You're not supposed to highlight that issue as everyone knows that blizzs AI pathing is dumb as nails, and it always will be thanks to the dated game and spaghetti code. The few pet classes in-game will never warrant a proper fix considering half the time you don't notice any issues ... as they put it. :confused: Their timeconstraint doesn't allow them to spend time on an issue they don't consider productive or enough of an issue to warrant the time fixing it.</div></div><hr />

Install the Bad Pet addon. They'll get the hint when chat gets spammed. My main is a hunter, and I have no qualms incriminating myself if I screw up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By making them EVEN MORE GENERIC?<br />
<br />
I wish hunter pets had been pushed in the opposite direction like they used to be. I want bears and turtles to be tanky by default. I want bats and snakes and birds to be PVP harrassers by default and I don't want them to be tanky too. I want there to be pure glass cannon DPS pets and some more durable reliable DPS pets. I don't suppose we need oldschool pet talent trees but I sure would like to select SOME skills for pets instead of every bear being the same and every bird being the same. Right now, pets are stat sticks and that's what they're being tuned to be even more and that's super boring. They're obligatory pets, not flavorful pets. Kinda defeats the point of being a Hunter unless your entire WoW existence is playing pretty pretty princess dressup and you have to have a kitty cat and don't want to get yelled at in a raid for having your precious kitty cat as your pet.<br />
<br />
I like the direction they are going. I don't have to HAVE to use a certain pet for specific abilities or types. I like them having pet families so that you still have to switch but it's not as specific.<br />
<br />
Currently, in live, any pet can do anything. That is boring.</div></div><hr />

Call your pet, bloodlust, dismiss pet. Easy enough.<br />

You can't call a pet if you have Lone Wolf.</div></div><hr />

But with This change why would I bring my wolf if the raid already has classes with a lust. So this change will force me to pick a tenacity pet because they have better abilities. So I won't be able to choose a pet I want like we do now. A lot of posts on these threads show how ignorant people are about Hunter pets.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dembai</div><div class="date">2018-02-15, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Tenacity CD is too powerful, while the BL access is SHITE (as most raids will have access to it anyway and you can only use one a fight), and removing Brezzes, which are 100% more important than BL access, just takes away one of the more important things a hunter brought to a raid that is pushing into harder content.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that because the Tenacity CD is so powerful, that no hunter would (in their right mind) ever bring a Ferocity pet again, even though they are (on a visual level) the most appealing pets.<br />
<br />
Take Lust - Give Brez. And Give Brez regardless of spec. Or put it on the Cunning Pets, and Give Ferocity pets something else. As it stands, the most popular pets will not be seen on high level hunters come BFA. And that's a real shame. (Unless you're going to restrict Shammies and Mages from casting Lust as often as they do (ie: put it back on a long CD)</div></div><hr />

they are simplifying pet mechanic to much there is no value in hunting rare pets beside how they look and they are reduced into a simple dot, i would like them go back old mechanics (different stats, feeding, learning abilities, etc) polish them a bit and make hunting rare pets or difficult to tame one (those with special mechanics or tameable raid bosses) worth taming and fostering.</div></div><hr />

The problem with making rare pets or spirit pets better than others is that not everyone can get one during the course of an expansion. Bad design IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's bad design if it's only about camping a spot with other x player to get one or if the requirement is to clear x dungeon/raid in mythic, but a system that require fostering a pet like it was back in vanilla is not.<br />
Anyway we can debate how to make the system better on thing is clear for me the current way of making pet different only visually is just retarded and extremely immersion breaking (a lion do same damage and have same ability as a turtle?).</div></div><hr />

Then get out of range, argument is valid again. You really just sound like an angry little girl, lol.</div></div><hr />

I remember before WoD Blizz said that they see survs taking malicious ammo(?), so they think that people dont like lone wolf at surv. But people took that mostly because it was better balance-wise, not gameplay-wise.</div></div><hr />
