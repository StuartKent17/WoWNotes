<br />
More changes to the 2.2 version, add this to the fact that the voice chat went live, maybe we can finally expect a release.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Jewelcrafting<br />
A new recipe for Steady Talasite is now available from the Halaa vendors, at the cost of research tokens. This superior green gem grants resilience and stamina.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing<br />
Added a new recipe for Ragesteel Shoulders that drops from an unknown creature in Shadowmoon Valley.<br />
Reduced the number of pieces required to get the benefits of the Ragesteel set bonus. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
Reduced the cooldown on the engineer-made Parachute Cloak.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
Banish the Demons now rewards either a Darkrune or a Fragmented Darkrune. Five fragmented Darkrunes can be combined to create a Darkrune.<br />
In the Bomb Them Again quest, the cooldown of the Skyguard bombs was decreased to 5 seconds (was 10).<br />
In the Relic's Emanation quest, the money reward was decreased while the Ogri'la faction reward was increased.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
Tempest Keep and Coilfang raid bosses will now all drop at least 3 items each.<br />
<br />
Auchindoun - Heroic Sethekk Halls<br />
Polymorph should no longer affect the main tank.<br />
Auchindoun-Shadow Labyrinth<br />
The recast time for the Shadow Word: Pain cast by Cabal Shadow Priests has been increased.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Black Temple<br />
Saber Lash tanks will no longer be knocked back by Sinister Beam or hit by Fatal Attraction, even if they dodge or parry the attack.<br />
Mother Shahraz will now pick a new beam to cast after every 3rd beam instead of after every 5th. This means she is much less likely to cast the same beam many times in a row.<br />
Fatal Attraction now deals 750 damage on the first tick, 1500 on the second, 2250 on the third, and 3000 on all subsequent ticks.<br />
Prismatic Shield is now more fun. Specifically, Mother Shahraz now takes bonus damage from one school when she is resistant to its opposite. Her resistances now change randomly every 15 seconds and are capped at 25%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Caverns of Time- Battle of Mount Hyjal<br />
The health of Jaina and Thrall have been increased again from their temporarily lowered values. They should be able to absorb quite a bit more incidental damage during the event.<br />
Archimonde has received several adjustments and fixes to prevent some of the harder to counter combinations of his abilities. Archimonde's Soul Charge silence has been lowered in duration to 4 seconds, and the death of the Priest with Spirit of Redemption will no longer create two Soul Charges. The casting time of Archimonde's fear has been increased to 1.5 seconds, and he should now use his Fear ability on a much more consistent interval. Archimonde will also no longer cast Grip of the Legion on very far away targets.<br />
Archimonde will no longer cast Grip of the Legion on targets that have just been hit with Air Burst.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Caverns of Time- Black Morass<br />
Increased recast time on Shadow Bolt Volley on Rift Keeper, also reduced damage on Heroic.<br />
Reduced hit points of Infinite Executioners on Heroic.<br />
Decreases the maximum possible stacks of Temporus' Mortal Wound from 10 to 7.<br />
Increased recast time for Temporus' Hasten spell on Heroic.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Caverns of Time- Escape from Durnholde Keep<br />
The composition of the pulls around the barracks in Durnholde Keep is now more consistent. Players should no longer face more than two Riflemen, or more than one Warden.<br />
The group of guards underneath the bridge has been removed in Heroic difficulty.<br />
The Thrall escort event now allows 20 tries at completing the event instead of 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Coilfang Reservoir: Serpentshrine Cavern<br />
Coilfang Priestesses no longer perform Spirit of Redemption.<br />
Underbog Colossus' Acid Spray is now somewhat less dangerous.<br />
Underbog Colossus' Spore Quake now has a shorter duration.<br />
Greyheart Tidecallers' Virulent poison is now less deadly.<br />
Serpentshrine Sporebats now charge less frequently.<br />
Greyheart Nether-Mages now blink less frequently.<br />
Serpentshrine Lurkers have had their damage output reduced.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hellfire Citadel: Shattered Halls<br />
The melee damage dealt by Shattered Hand Reavers, Shattered Hand Legionnaires, Shattered Hand Heathens, and Rabid Warhounds has been reduced.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valeea</div><div class="date">2007-08-11, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no. you all dont understand. they just move the border of &quot;hard content&quot; more nd more to the endgame, which is very appreciated by &quot;casual&quot; guilds. dont bother. if you are so good, you did this already and did not have to wait for these nerves. everyone hailed you for your imbaness. or perhaps not...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-08-11, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm happy, it opens up the game to more people, this game was not made for just hardcore raid guilds.<br />
<br />
I still hope I'll get to see BT and Hyjal by WotLK (looking likely now actually)<br />
<br />
The content is still difficult, they are just nerfing the annoying aspects of it mainly (like the random luck factors, like when Archimonde uses both spells on the same target at once resulting in an instant kill, thats just bad luck)<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll give us better notification of infernals on Prince now, because thats probably the worst encounter luck-wise..</div></div><hr />

i can agree with this one.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JayJay</div><div class="date">2007-08-11, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They shouldn't nerf the trash in SSC imo, right now it's like you have to focus on trash to even get to bosses, after the patch it's 15 playing rest afk =/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viper007Bond</div><div class="date">2007-08-11, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Darkrunes: thank god. That event takes some serious practice and getting enough runes to practice is a paaain.<br />
<br />
Bombs: woot again. Sitting around waiting for the cooldown on my epic mount was a pain too.<br />
<br />
Eminations: another woot. Rep with Orgi'la is slow to get.<br />
<br />
BM: Totally doable now, but it'll be nice that it'll be a little easier in terms of damage done as you only get one try for the most part. And those executions were a pain too -- made me come off boss and help the mage kill it (a TON of hit points).<br />
<br />
Durnholde: another happy time for me. Thrall loves to suicide and having 20 tries at it rather than a stupid 3 should result in 100% finishes (although 5 probably woulda been sufficient).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-08-11, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you can't complete Durneholde in 5, you fail anyway.. unless your group composition is like.. 5 warriors?<br />
<br />
So why 20? Did they just roll a 20 sided die and get lucky?<br />
<br />
How many of you would honestly stay for a COT run if you already wiped over 5 times? lol</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wildhorn</div><div class="date">2007-08-11, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To answer Gigas, the SH nerf is to make SH less CC dependant.<br />
<br />
and YES, 5sec cooldown on bombs now... was such a pain to wait 10sec.</div></div><hr />

OHZ NOEZ NOTZ THEZ FIVEZ MANZ NERFZ ZOMG IZ QUITZ!<br />
<br />
Seriously? That bothers you? How does nerfing five mans, make it gear &gt; skill? Like you needed skill or gear in the first place to even beat these zones. As for ssc/tk trash, you obviously haven't seen bt/hyjal trash which is MUCH easier. They are scaling it down to tier 6 difficulty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, it bothers me that they're nerfing 5 mans and heroics. C'mon, 20 tries to finish Durnholde? What a joke, this place is easily doable with three tries. If they wanted to add more tries, they should've just added two more to make it five. Can anyone here see themselves failing at saving Thrall nineteen times?! And ok, you might be right about this not making things about gear, but who exactly is Blizzard catering to here? People with MS? This is sad.<br />
As for the SSC/BT/Hyjal nerfs, I didnt really say anything about them. My beef is with the 5 man and heroic nerfs being completely uncalled for.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juju</div><div class="date">2007-08-14, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol, this keeps getting better and better by the day, doesn't it? This game was already easy, but now heroic mode is gonna be easy mode... maybe they ought to have a noobish heroic mode and a real deal heroic mode in the future... that way the game is &quot;opened&quot; to more players (aka: it was already opened, people just didn't have enough skills for it, or time).<br />
Sad to see something (already not very) challenging tuned into something so... lame?</div></div><hr />
