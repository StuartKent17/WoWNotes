Rogue Legendary and Patch 4.3<br />
Another interview (http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/112981-WoW-Producer-Discusses-Killing-Deathwing-Raid-Finder-and-Everything-Patch-4-3) showed up today in The Escapist. The most important part is the Rogue Legendary dagger and new raid level difficulty, but the important points are all below.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogues will get a legendary dagger and exciting quest line to go with it. The lore for the dagger has not been decided upon yet.<br />
Looking for Raid tool raids will be easier than normal raids using a new level of difficulty (Looking For Raid).<br />
The Looking for Raid tool will only work for 25 man raids, not 10 man.<br />
Players will get different achievements and loot from doing Random Raid mode, no normal mode achievements or perks will be gained.<br />
This will introduce players to the content and mechanics of the fights so that they are more prepared for an actual raid.<br />
The new five mans will have tighter story integration with the Deathwing Raid than Icecrown Heroics did.<br />
The Dragonflights will work together to help take down Deathwing.<br />
Deathwing's random zone burning will continue at least until the end of Patch 4.3.<br />
They might be talking about Pandas at Blizzcon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2011-09-13, 11:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So... what I'm getting here is that Looking-For Raids will possibly be tuned to be easier than normal-mode raids, and will drop lower-quality stuff?<br />
<br />
I'm disappointed, but I'm not surprised. Although, I think what they're trying to accomplish in the long run would be established by just simply re-introducing raid attunements.<br />
<br />
As far as the legendary goes, I'm holding off judgement until a blue posts about it. I suppose that the same could be said about the LFR inferrence. However, I'm just gonna say that I'm (1) not surprised at a Rogue-specific legendary and (2) not angry about it. I mean, hunters got their legendary ages ago.... and the one real Rogue legendary was so RNG-reliant that no one on either servers I seriously raided on got the set until long into WotLK.<br />
<br />
I mean honestly, for some classes to be able to have 'their' legendary, that'll come at the expense of other classes not getting theirs. That's how it's always been.</div></div><hr />

Really? Looking for Raid tool raids will be easier than normal raids using a new level of difficulty (Looking For Raid). ...and the community goes even more to shit.

Unnecessary This will introduce players to the content and mechanics of the fights so that they are more prepared for an actual raid. Unnecessary. People who need help at the current difficulty level of raids have no business raiding at all. The new five mans will have tighter story integration with the Deathwing Raid than Icecrown Heroics did. Poaching from swtor. Trying to anyways. The Dragonflights will work together to help take down Deathwing. More quests! YAY! Deathwing's random zone burning will continue at least until the end of Patch 4.3. No one cared after the first week.

i agree, it should've been a feral legendary, rogues already had warglaives. I'm a hunter, so i could possibly use either one if stats are right, but it needed to be a feral item.</div></div><hr />

To be more accurate, we have been literally begging for some class fixes since beta which Blizzard totally ignored and kept breaking our class while patching with further unbalancing, we are subpar in raids and PvP, and broken in many of our aspects, yet even though how mages, rogues and such classes faceroll both these aspects, we still get to be the most hated, with not getting a legendary(I've been a DW DK since 3.2 and been forced to go to 2H, yet I'm still DW and only legendary we've got are some RNG drop glaives from content when we didn't even exist) if tier 13 is as irrelevant as our t12(let alone its bug look rather than the supposed &quot;elementium dragon&quot;), my 13€/month being cut will be the first of many.</div></div><hr />

Tito: How does it fit into the lore?<br />
<br />
Brack: We haven't decided on the name and how it's going to work, we just know that we really want a legendary weapon to come out of this tier and we really want it to be a rogue dagger. That's really all we know at this point. As time goes on we get a lot more lore, a lot more story, an &quot;in&quot; to the creation of all the legendary weapons. We really did a lot with the legendary axe that you got out of Lich King and then we've had other legendaries with the Cataclysm tiers that have had these storylines, we're hoping this one's going to be the most exciting, the most epic legendary quest line.&quot;<br />
Quote from that article. Really doesn't fit Blizzard's style, not knowing anything about the reasoning behind a legendary at this stage? And comparing to &quot;other legendaries with Cataclysm?&quot; Someones having a good troll</div></div><hr />

Good luck on downing the bosses with only healers and tanks...<br />

...and in addition, we are either getting trolled or Blizzard has really lost it, giving a legendary exclusive to the one class that is sneakiest, slimiest, non-engaging(flee the warzone if things get tight type)...a class that is actually is least relevant to warcraft as them being the least relevant to warfare getting-exclusively is just non-sense, I'm hoping we are getting trolled...</div></div><hr />

yeah cause warglaives weren't clearly aimed at rogues. you can argue warriors used em too but honestly what guilds gave it to a warrior over a rogue back in TBC? during a time when hybrids did crap tons less dps then pures. That was essencially a rogue only legendary unless you were in a guild where for some strange reason had no rogues, or had drops out the ass.<br />
<br />
first legendary was for tanks? what the one that only one person in world got to keep cause it was accidentally left in the game?<br />
<br />
Also shadowmourn doesn't count as a legendary cause blood DKs got to use it. that's just their gimmik that they use dps 2 handers.<br />
<br />
Way i see it<br />
<br />
tanks, enhance shaman, and feral druids are do. if anything thse are 3 that have gotten no love.</div></div><hr />

If anyone feels that, they're literally not paying attention. Casters have one this tier. And it's not even very limited. Any DPS caster can use it.</div></div><hr />

To be more accurate, we have been literally begging for some class fixes since beta which Blizzard totally ignored and kept breaking our class while patching with further unbalancing, we are subpar in raids and PvP, and broken in many of our aspects, yet even though how mages, rogues and such classes faceroll both these aspects, we still get to be the most hated, with not getting a legendary(I've been a DW DK since 3.2 and been forced to go to 2H, yet I'm still DW and only legendary we've got are some RNG drop glaives from content when we didn't even exist) if tier 13 is as irrelevant as our t12(let alone its bug look rather than the supposed &quot;elementium dragon&quot;), my 13€/month being cut will be the first of many.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why were you forced to go 2H? DW frost is better than/equal to 2h unholy. I also have no idea what you're talking about with being subpar. I do just fine on my dk in PvE, and in PvP I do great in frost. Blood tanking is a little messed up, but pvp is so much fun because you can just live forever. <br />
<br />
Also DKs had Shadowmourne last expansion, and it was pretty much made for death knights. Not everyone gets to have a legendary every patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give me one good reason why a role which is significantly more difficult to play then a DPS (Though Tanking might be pretty easy as well now since the aggro boost, though I have no experience of this myself) should not deserve these additional boosts. We all know that DPS is the easiest task in the game in practically every aspect. Why should they be the ones to get the Legendary items? It's not like they actually need them.<br />
<br />
In fact, all Blizzard is accomplishing like this is supporting the &quot;WE NEED HIGHER NUMBERS&quot; mentality which 90% of all DPS players seem to possess.<br />
<br />
But alas, it's my opinion, and I don't plan to change it. I see no reason as to why I'm wrong about my claims.</div></div><hr />

Technically, they got Sulfuras since this was before they got dual wield. On the other hand, rogues (and warriors) got the Warglaive of Azzinoth back in BC.<br />
<br />
Some times we just miss out; I probably would have been first in line for the legendary staff if I didn't have to be a good officer and be main spec healer to help fill out roles.<br />
<br />
The sad part is our guild has no rogues (or hunters) at all (for the last 4 months). So if it's just rogue it might just go to waste. If Enh could use it, then I'd probably just take it for a trophy set myself. If Feral could use it, well then our GM would take it as a trophy set (as he refuses to do any role other than tank).</div></div><hr />

Um yes thunderfury counts. It may have been a lengendary way back when, but it still was there. Don't go crying about tanks not having a lengendary when they &quot;have&quot; and some classes like enhancement shamans or feral druids haven't.</div></div><hr />

The Lead Producer of World of Warcraft gives the skinny on the ultimate patch of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Like Illidan and Arthas before him, WoW players were pretty sure there was going to be a throwdown against the ancient Dragon Aspect, Neltharion - now known as Deathwing - in the final patch of Cataclysm. J. Allen Brack, lead producer of the MMO from Blizzard, said that with patch 4.3 not only will experienced raiders get a shot at downing the huge black dragon in the most epic raid fight ever, but players who aren't in a raiding guild will be able to find groups easier with a new Raid Finder tool. Brack also gave more information on the Void Storage and Transmogrification features and hinted at the news of an expansion that may drop at BlizzCon in October. Oh, and rogues will get some love in the form of a legendary dagger.<br />
<br />
Here is the full Q&amp;A with the man behind the curtain of World of Warcraft on everything he has to say about the last patch of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Greg Tito: What can we expect from Patch 4.3?<br />
<br />
J. Allen Brack, Lead Producer of World of Warcraft: We've got a handful of features to talk about and we've got a handful of dungeons. Then something we've previously had in 4.3 is going to be the actual raid where players are able to fight Deathwing and ultimately defeat him. The raid and the dungeons are really tied together with one long story. We're not really spoiling a whole lot as to how that is going to work but the lore of how players are actually able to gain enough power in order to defeat one of the most powerful dragon aspects is kind of told throughout the story of three dungeons and then the actual Deathwing raid.<br />
<br />
Tito: Cool. What are the three dungeons?<br />
<br />
Brack: The three dungeons will basically have different kind of pieces that allow players to [pause] we're not going to say too much about that. There will be three dungeons that players will be able to participate in that will be all new, something the players haven't done before. Then the story of those dungeons will lead right into the actual raid where players will actually confront and fight Deathwing.<br />
<br />
Tito: Is it going to be similar to how Icecrown Citadel worked where a bunch of five mans led up to the raid of Arthas?<br />
<br />
Brack: That's definitely the model although we wanted to tie the story of the raid and the story of the dungeons considerably tighter than we did for Icecrown. So with Icecrown we had what's it like to attack Arthas and how the players react to that in a five person dungeon but there wasn't necessarily a story that carried over from the dungeons to the raid in the same manner we're doing with Deathwing. But the model that we're following is very similar.<br />
<br />
Tito: Do you have anything else to say about that raid other than it's probably going to be pretty tough?<br />
<br />
Brack: We're trying to make it the most exciting most epic raid we've ever done. Players will actually fight Deathwing in multiple phases so there's a lot of different ways for players to be fighting Deathwing throughout that encounter.<br />
<br />
Tito: Is it going to be in the air or on the ground?<br />
<br />
Brack: We're actually doing multiple phases so there will be some ground phases and some air phases.<br />
<br />
Tito: Will you be flying other dragons?<br />
<br />
Brack: We're not going to say. To be determined. You'll have to see it when it goes live.<br />
<br />
Tito: Do the other dragon flights get involved?<br />
<br />
Brack: They're definitely a huge part of the lore and the story. The dragon flights kind of have to come together to help bring Deathwing down.<br />
Tito: What else about the raid finder is going on?<br />
<br />
Brack: We really want it to be a way for players to get into and experience the highest level of raid content. Right now we have some PUGs (Pick Up Groups) that are able to work where it's a very manual process for players to do it. They're probably not able to do the highest level of content but there's something that they want to do. What if we, instead of having players kind of struggle to get this group together so that they can experience a content level behind, what if we just create a system that allows players to auto match make and automatically facilitates them getting into the most recent content at a different difficulty level.<br />
<br />
Tito: I've never been able to raid myself as I've never had the time to wrangle players. This might be a way to make that much easier<br />
<br />
Brack: Very similar to the way the dungeon finder works where you can log in and say &quot;I've got an hour and I want to run a dungeon.&quot; Click on dungeon finder and let the right thing happen. We're trying to make this at some same level of frictionless entry where you can go on and experience Deathwing content and immediately get on and enjoy that content.<br />
<br />
Tito: Is that everything on 4.3?<br />
<br />
Brack: There's one more piece which is an announcement that we're releasing a rogue legendary weapon. Specific for rogues, so it will be a dagger. There will be some sort of quest, traditionally we've done these quests that players need to participate in order to create the legendary weapon in this case we'll be focusing on rogues that will try to make that happen.<br />
<br />
Tito: Do you know what it's called yet?<br />
<br />
Brack: We do not?<br />
<br />
Tito: How does it fit into the lore?<br />
<br />
Brack: We haven't decided on the name and how it's going to work, we just know that we really want a legendary weapon to come out of this tier and we really want it to be a rogue dagger. That's really all we know at this point. As time goes on we get a lot more lore, a lot more story, an &quot;in&quot; to the creation of all the legendary weapons. We really did a lot with the legendary axe that you got out of Lich King and then we've had other legendaries with the Cataclysm tiers that have had these storylines, we're hoping this one's going to be the most exciting, the most epic legendary quest line.<br />
<br />
Tito: I'm sure that'll make all of the rogue's happy. I'm going to be attending BlizzCon in October, is 4.3 going to be released before then?<br />
<br />
Brack: We do not announce dates.<br />
<br />
Tito: That's true ... So soon or late?<br />
<br />
Brack: Sorry?<br />
<br />
Tito: Are you thinking in the next couple weeks? Months?<br />
<br />
Brack: 4.3 is not currently out of PTR (Public Test Realm). There will be some PTR time that we want before the patch actually goes live and we haven't currently released to the PTR. So not next week is the answer.<br />
<br />
Tito: Not soon. I have tons of questions about the next expansion but that's not something you can really talk about.<br />
<br />
Brack: That sounds like something we may potentially be talking about at BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
Tito: Does it have to do with pandas?<br />
<br />
Brack: That sounds like something we may be talking about at BlizzCon.</div></div><hr />

I'll also agree with the masses that LFR sounds pretty pointless, normal modes are just fine the way they are. if you want to see the content with no effort then just watch them on youtube. Still, I'll wait for confirmation from Blizz for some of this, MMO is usually good with this stuff mind you but I've never heard of that site before.</div></div><hr />

Theoretically they could put a choice for a polearm in a sense to obtain it with strength or agility, depending whether it's for a dk or feral, evening it out to be 2 + 2. In 5.1 I expect either an agility polearm for cats or a tanking 1-hander. I don't see all 4 tanks getting a legendary at any time in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly the problem is, Blizzard is showering us with epics to the extent that only legendaries feel special anymore. Back in vanilla very few people had full epics; heck few people even had more than one or two crafted ones. Even in TBC epics took a while to get. Imo this game needs a new rarity of gear between epic and legendary to drop out of heroic raids.</div></div><hr />

Before the abominations of Nefarian and Deathwing were thrust into our world, such meetings of the Aspect were represented by the term 'Prismatic.' I could only assume that the Prismatic Blade of Quel'Serrar was a most glorious creation.could be either a tanking sword/sword with ago/sword with str when u complete the quest u get to choose.</div></div><hr />

DW frost is better than/equal to 2h unholy. I also have no idea what you're talking about with being subpar. I do just fine on my dk in PvE, and in PvP I do great in frost. Blood tanking is a little messed up, but pvp is so much fun because you can just live forever. <br />
<br />
Also DKs had Shadowmourne last expansion, and it was pretty much made for death knights. Not everyone gets to have a legendary every patch.<br />
<br />
Shadowmourne being released is akin to being forced to go 2H by blizzard along with Unholy having the weapon beating the pulp out of us along with every slow 1H weapon that was viable for the tier had no str on them and the BiS(284 axes) lacked ArPen alond with Str, whereas Unholy was facerolling PvP and PvE compared to us with their shiny 2H weapon, while we were still targeted for the DK hate.<br />
<br />
...and being able to live forever as a Blood DK(only against melee) along with decimating every melee-class(except blood DKs then its just a moebius band of an engagement) is an indication of being broken while getting beaten to pulp by casters, I don't want single sided OPness, but balance in my class. I get my fun in the game when I get to experience a storyline that is relevant with my character(Nothing was with us DKs in Cataclysm), if not it get boring.<br />
<br />
In terms of being subpar, last I've checked Assasination and Combat Rogues along with Fury Warriors were above us in terms of WoL results...<br />
<br />
In the end, it is unfair to alot of classes/specs if Rogues get to have an exclusive legendary again(Warglaives were for rogues as fury warrior dps back then was a joke to the point of getting you kicked out of even a dungeon group if you were one). In addition, this would be blizzard going back on their word(again) in terms of making legendary appeal to more than 1-class and daggers being not really fit for being legendaries...</div></div><hr />

But yea all in all if you dont make a feral one atleast make a tank one. it just is annoying that it is another one to a class that already got a few hell they have warglaves maybe the best looking swords in the game. bet you next one after this will be for warr. as there have been a full expansion without them getting one OMG crazy! hmm alot of QQing in one post but i just finde this realy annoying. and up front sry about me not haveing the best english. but it is 2 in the morning i am annoyed about this and well english is not my first Languages:P</div></div><hr />

Don't go crying about tanks not having a lengendary when they &quot;have&quot; and some classes like enhancement shamans or feral druids haven't.<br />
<br />
To be fair, if you're going back that far to say that tanks did, at one point in time, have a legendary weapon, then, likewise, so have Enhancement Shaman and Feral Druids -- it's called Sulfuras.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Starscream101</div><div class="date">2011-09-13, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why so many melee legendary's compared to casters.Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros 2handed mace,<br />
Shadowmourne 2handed axe,<br />
Thunderfury 1handed sword,<br />
Warglaives 2 1handed swords,<br />
vs <br />
Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings 1handed mace healer,<br />
Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury BowDragonwrath, <br />
Tarecgosa's Rest 2haned caster staff,<br />
<br />
It should of been 2 1handed axes so that Rogues Hunters and Shamie's could use it so that it was not limited to just 2 classes. But i bet they make a staff or pole arm that has better stats for hunter so hunters wont get it or need it anyways. But if it was axes shamie's and rouges could use it not just the 1 class.<br />
so that's 5 legendary's rogues will walk around in 2 Warglaives, Thunderfury, Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury, and in 4.3 Daggers. <br />
And why hell did they make it where hunter's could not use Warglaives but Warriors and Rogue's could use Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury does that seem fair no it is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have no source, but a while back when we were trying find out what the caster legendary would be, I was sure one of the replies from Blizzard was: &quot;A dagger would be too difficult to make it look epic and give it that legendary 'feel' as opposed to a staff&quot;. It was something along those lines. Yet here we now see a dagger?<br />
<br />
A shield would of been perfect. Either that or a polearm.</div></div><hr />

As for the the other classes whining, you probably had your chance, and you're still complaining.......<br />

Rogues fight for Warlocks as the most least played class, maybe this will change things, GET OVER IT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
dont get your hopes up, the whole article looked like fake to begin with<br />
2nd thing, after whole homogenization and making everything more accessible for every1, making all gear pieces apply to as many classes as possible its HIGHLY doubtfull (to say the least) that they will make legendary for 2 speccs of 1 class. Not after all this homogenization.<br />
<br />
Not mentioning glaives served you well for a VERY long time and you ahd TF before that. Hunter had thoridal for few months form a boss that barely any1 killed so they were in the very same situation as casters in vanilla. Tanks had only thunderfury so i would be suprised if any class would get legendary before hunters/tanks and even more if legendary would be just for 1 class (not even full since its just 2 speccs)<br />
<br />
So as i said dont get your hopes up as this article really looked like fake (blizz doesnt tend to release such info so soon and especially when they arent being asked about such thing as legendary)<br />
<br />
Edit: o and not mentioning that considering deathwing armor, tank legendary would be most suitable</div></div><hr />

I guess it's a good thing I quit playing my hunter when Cata came out. I thought for sure it'd be a Feral Druid/Hunter shared legendary this time or just a hunter legendary bow as Blizzard will never make a legendary for a single class's spec. But yeah I find this hilarious. Thunderfury, Glaives, and Thoridal for rogues now they get another. And you rogues crying about it being a main hand dagger saying it will hurt combat rogues are cracking me up. What about thunderfury and Glaives. Were these usable by dagger rogues? No, they all spec'd out of daggers to use them.</div></div><hr />

Just make sure you keep Hardmodes, Hard.&quot;The new five mans will have tighter story integration with the Deathwing Raid than Icecrown Heroics did.&quot; - The ICC 5mans where the best ever.

So your going to have 5 man, heroics, 10 man raids and their heroics, then 25 easy mode raid, regular raid, and heroic raid. It won't matter a lot in 4.3 but if they do this in the next expac, then thats 7 different iLVL's. I understand that future patches would only affect new raids iLVL and maybe new heroic iLVL but still. The only thing I can think they might do to reduce the iLVL numbers is having the 25 random raid drop loot that is on par with heroic 5 mans. If you offer loot that is as good as a 10 man raid in a 25 random raid easy mode run, then no one would run it on 10 man. I personally dont think this is the way to go, but more info is needed.</div></div><hr />

I can't speak to the scaling as my rogue is still only 80, but regarding your money... I wouldn't place it on an axe or mace. As much as I would like to agree, and hope for a weapon that's usable by more than one class, it's not going to happen. In the Escapist interview that spawned this very discussion, J Allen Brack said they wanted it to be a Rogue-specific legendary (because they wanted to do a Rogue questline/story), and that it will be a dagger.<br />
<br />
There's no room for interpretation or hopes of any sort with that kind of a statement... =/<br />

Vegas money has it on AGI item, side bet on it being Hunter/Shaman/Druid only, no Rogues. Hunter Bow was the most short lived, ammo changed implemented shortly after it was available made it obsolete very quickly. Tarecgosa's only being useful for 1/4 of Druid and 1/3 of Shaman specs makes them likely candidates to benefit also. As these 3 specs seem like the best possibilities it will very well most likely be an AGI item. <br />

1 Legendary quest with rewards depending on class, a Swiss Army knife type of reward; Polearm for Ferals; Claws for Enhancement; Bow for Hunters.</div></div><hr />

Sulferas was not a feral legendary. They did not benefit from the proc or the weapon dps back then. Thus it was not designed for feral Druids. If you count that as a legendary for ferals then ulduar mace was a rogue legendary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A legendary that is only good for a single class and only 2 specs of that class? Really?! I can honestly say that if there is not some point in which you can decide if you want the dagger to be Int or Agi I will be highly disappointed by this revelation. Its all good, Rogues haven't had access to a legendary since... oh wait they had access to a legendary bow and 2 legendary swords in TBC and then there is Thunderfury. How about doing something for the other classes. A legendary Shield would have at least covered two classes and not just one. A legendary polearm could have hit up Druids, Hunters and possibly Warriors/Paladins if they did it correctly. Yet they choose a dagger that is only worth anything to 2 specs... just doesnt make sense. I will say that the Staff was a less than stellar in implementation but no one can argue the fact that it had a decent class spread. Looking back on the other legendaries at least 2 classes could legitimately use them. This is just plain old disappointment on all fronts from this interview.</div></div><hr />

If 4.3 does indeed come out before the end of the year it's going to be out on the PTR &quot;soon&quot; which means that, bugs and balance withstanding, it's done.

Druids have had Atiesh, Val'anyr and Dragonwrath, thats 3 legendaries your class has had.<br />
<br />
Feral Druid is not a CLASS, it's a SPEC. Druids have had 2 legendaries in the last 2 expansions.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it mentions nothing about the loot being different. Only the difficulty and the achievements...<br />

My theory is it will either have a) the same quality loot as normal 25 man or b) 10man ilevels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, we could use Thunderfury, but I'm willing to bet the amount of guilds that gave it to a rogue first, were slim to none. Warglaives were almost the same in unless you were a prominent figure in your guild, most warriors got it before rogues. If it even dropped. As for the bow? Wee a stat stick...<br />
<br />
All people do is talk shit about rogues. All the time. We're the scum of the game to the entire community.<br />

Rag Hammer = Anyone who can 2h Warrior, DK, Pally, Druid (back then, shams could as well)<br />
Thunderfury = Rogue, Warrior (No class req. now though)<br />
Atiesh = Mage, Druid, Priest, Warlock<br />
Thor'idal = Hunter (though not class restricted technically)<br />
Warglaives = DK, Rogue, Warrior<br />
Val'anyr = Priest, Pally, Sham, Druid (basically anyone who could heal)<br />
Shadowmourne = Pally, DK, Warrior<br />
Dragonwrath = Mage, Druid, Priest, Warlock (though not class restricted technically)<br />
So unless I'm missing something, EVERY SINGLE CLASS has had at LEAST one legendary. So quit your whining. They can't make legendaries for every class and every spec in every expansion, so deal with what you get.</div></div><hr />

This is ridiculous.... It's like a Dungeon Finder and their loots... if it's different from Raid Looting, then we will have ANOTHER thing to do before raiding (I see many ppl asking for at least FULL LFR items lol) that's not right at all...<br />
<br />
To be honest... Blizzard shouldn't even bother for this...<br />
<br />
I thought this was coming for players with no time for COREs with demanding time, but that would be able (with much more sacrifice and patience) to get their so desired items to look like that HARDCORE players that raids and get all the items first, to feel a little less SUBJUGATED... but what they'll do is just make people without time look pathetic for having items from LFR instead of making the items the same of the normal Raids, but just with less drop chance, lol I don't know... really, it's not the way me and my friends were asking for....</div></div><hr />

1) 10/25/25 special people raid......unlikely to happen since they can't balance raids at the moment.<br />
2) They merged 10 and 25 man loot tables to make their life easier, doubt they will add more loot<br />
3) Seriously does blizzard have that much faith in their players who use PuGs to be able to do a 25 man fight, short of the fights having no/negligable mechanics. Since fights will need to have mechanics for real raiders its unlikely<br />
4) Rogue legendary is way to small a target, how many 10 mans have rogues? OH legendary all 3 specs can use but then its a LOL issue at OH being legendary not MH. MH will be a 1 spec weapon not just a 1 class. (2 if sub is viable)</div></div><hr />
