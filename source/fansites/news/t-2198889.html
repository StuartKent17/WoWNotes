<br />
Patch 7.2.5 - Guardian Changes<br />
In my earlier post on this thread, I mentioned we were already considering what the right changes to Guardian would be going into Tomb, but that it was likely going to be for 7.2.5 and not 7.2. In the first 7.2.5 PTR, you can expect to see the following changes to Guardian:<br />
<br />
--Mark of Ursol removed<br />
--Maul costs 30 Rage (from 20), is now on the GCD, can now proc Gore, and damage increased by 400%.<br />
<br />
I imagine the first change is most pertinent to those focused on the broader issue of tank balance. It may seem rather extreme, and that's part of why doing it mid-tier wasn't the plan we went with. But two factors that were important were 1) Mark of Ursol's design (trade your physical AM for a magical AM) was somewhat incompatible with any use of magic damage other than an occasional threatening spike, and 2) Druids had little in the way of identifiable weaknesses or things that potentially scare them. Even without Mark of Ursol, they have a mastery that's fully effective against magic, multiple medium to long cooldowns, Frenzied Regeneration, and some passives like Adaptive Fur. While we'll be continuing to watch this in 7.2.5 development, our expectation is that they will not struggle to complete content that involves magic damage--which the clearest test of why a button that allows them to mitigate it so much further is not needed at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Destruction Warlock Resource Changes in 7.2.5<br />
As we've mentioned before, we’re making a number of changes to the resource model for Destruction Warlocks in the next patch. The goal is to create smoother, more granular, less random Soul Shard generation and make Chaos Bolt casts feel more impactful.<br />
<br />
First, for Destruction Warlocks, Soul Shards are being split into parts of 10, which we’re currently calling Soul Shard Fragments. Mechanically, this will be similar to the Mists of Pandaria resource system of Burning Embers, except we want to go with a consistent Soul Shard visual, updated Soul Shard UI (work in progress), and name for the resource across all 3 Warlock specs. Some relevant spell changes:<br />
<br />
<br />
Incinerate generates 1 Soul Shard Fragment. Doubled on critical strikes. Fire and Brimstone (talent) will cause Incinerate to generate 1 Soul Shard Fragment per target hit, also doubled on critical strikes. Immolate periodic damage has a 50% chance to generate 1 Soul Shard Fragment. 100% chance on critical strikes. Conflagrate generates 6 Soul Shard Fragments. Dimensional Rift (artifact active) generates 3 Soul Shard Fragments.<br />
<br />
The net result of these changes is that every baseline rotational damage spell will contribute to Soul Shard generation, pushing your resource forward at a steady pace.<br />
<br />
Second, Soul Shard generation/refund rate is being reduced overall, mainly for the single-target rotation. However, this is coupled with major damage increases to both Soul Shard spenders - Chaos Bolt and Rain of Fire. Combined, this means that Chaos Bolts will be cast less frequently, but they will hit much harder:<br />
<br />
<br />
Soul Shard refund chance of Soul Conduit (talent) reduced to 12%. Soulsnatcher (artifact bronze trait) reduced to 3% per point. Chaos Bolt damage increased by 40%. Rain of Fire damage increased by 25%.<br />
<br />
For the AOE rotation, Fire and Brimstone (talent) will cause Incinerate to generate Soul Shard Fragments per target hit, which would largely push Immolate out of the AOE rotation with enough targets. Alternately, if you want to go down the route of maintaining Immolate on all targets in a clumped AOE situation, Cataclysm (talent) will have reduced cooldown (30 sec) and slightly reduced cast time, making it easier for you to do so.<br />
<br />
As usual, everything discussed here will continue to be iterated on during 7.2.5 PTR and may change based on further playtesting and feedback.<br />

Legion Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part 2 - Account Wide Criteria<br />
My account has Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part 1 on my Rogue, but my raid had me swap mains, so now I'm on a Shaman. If I do Pathfinder, Part 2 on my Shaman, will my account still register both achievements as complete for flying?<br />
Yes, as long as Pathfinder Part 1 is complete on your Rogue, when you complete Pathfinder Part 2 on your Shaman it should count for the full meta to allow flying.

You don't fix guardian by making them terrible at mitigating magic, that just bad design. Instead of trying to bring all the tanks closer to each other you'll still have guardians way ahead of everyone else on 80% of the fights, and then they'll be terrible on 20%. All tanks should be close to each other, with all tanks being a bit stronger and weaker on some of the fights.</div></div><hr />

Oh they'll be more than fine against magic damage, given their enormous health pool, frenzied regeneration, adaptive fur and whatever else they have. They'll just not be quite as brokenly overpowered as they are now. Quite frankly, they need more nerfs than this, but it's a great start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not exactly sure what they are talking about with mastery providing ways to deal with magic damage, the only thing mastery does is increase health pool and make heals cast on the bear do more healing, so when is a larger hp pool suddenly considered mitigation?</div></div><hr />

It's pretty much embers,but purple<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm also pretty happy with the guardian bear changes,mostly because it's one more thing to help me convince my raid leader to let me go back to my DK instead of my bear,now they need to go further with the bear nerfs and bring the 3 bottom tanks up to a competitive level</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, I think it'd be better if they made MoU a magic absorb that didn't do too much (maybe 750k on a 15 second cd?).<br />
<br />
Mastery does help because as you said, it means you get increased healing done to you. But they missed the point, and the main problem with guardians in legion - they just scale too well because every single form of mitigation they have is % based, so as they get more gear the percentage just goes up and up. The alternative is to have fixed amounts of mitigation via absorbs or healing that scale directly with gear, which is easier to manage.<br />
<br />
In Nighthold druids are probably averaging between 75-80% physical damage reduction, and it's going to go up in Tomb of Sargeras as we get more gear. Then we get more mastery which increases healing, versatility which reduces all damage, etc. The scaling is out of control so boss damage has to go up a LOT every tier if they want to ever make a dent in a guardian.<br />
<br />
So now we're weak to magical, but still gods against physical. It's not a great nerf because it's really inconsistent. I'd rather be decent against everything than awesome against one thing and bad against another. And they need to think more about scaling, it's clear they don't have any concept of how to do it effectively.</div></div><hr />

Embers were around even when we had fire mages. So that's irrelevant. <br />

Also, since everyone has trouble understanding for some reason, i'm not ignoring what blizzard has said, I just thought embers would be nicer as people would be more used to building them up as destro warlocks. Just a cosmetic thing that people would be able to properly get used to faster over soulshards that are with every spec at the moment.<br />
<br />
Clear?<br />
<br />
So you, in your infinite wisdom and knowledge of all things World of Warcraft, have made the determination that Embers are better because you said so and therefore are above and beyond any of Blizzard's clearly defined reasoning for keeping shards. Oh, and if anybody dares disagree with your opinion on the matter, they're incapable of reading. <br />
<br />

Or you could, you know, just admit that you suck at reading instead of trying to create some weird alternate universe where your opinion on the matter is somehow more important than Blizzard's own reasoning. Where's that silly emoji you used... oh. Here you go: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</div></div><hr />

And quite frankly seeing you attempt to take the moral high ground when your attitude is condescending is just ridiculous. Case and point: <br />
<br />
1) Constantly using the ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ characters. You trying to anger people on purpose by acting like a condescending parent who can't make a point to a child?<br />
2) Sending of replies that are far more sarcastic than those you originally received. <br />
3) Arrogant dismissal of behaviour as a stereotypical whole - &quot;People these days&quot;<br />
4) Acting like you're talking to a stupid person. VERY rude. - &quot;Because Fire Mage. Embers. Theme. Fantasy. Clear?&quot; Have some respect, will you?<br />
5) Hypocrisy. - &quot;Well well you certainly are desperate for an argument aren't you?&quot; ... um, so are you?<br />
6) Yet more smarmy arrogance - &quot;Here you go! Here's your attention: (Wow, you're incredible! Read me like a book! Fantastic! Brilliance incarnate!)&quot;<br />
7) Being dismissive of other people's intellect - &quot;I look forward to hearing what other nonsense reasoning&quot;<br />
8) Signing a clearly inflammatory sentence with a KISS (x) symbol. You take pride in winding people up or something?<br />
9) Assuming you're innocent in all this - &quot;people wanted to jump down my throat for no reason&quot;<br />
10) Insulting people more directly - &quot;clearly you are the one who &quot;sucks at reading&quot;<br />
11) The fact you're still trying to act like others are in the wrong when you're just as bad for STILL BEING HERE REPLYING TO THEM.</div></div><hr />

Yeah you wouldn't understand how you're being condescending. It's a natural failing of humans. We tend to see ourselves as being better than we truly are. I have provided many clear examples of you being a douche. In any case whilst I agree that people are often horrible online, it doesn't mean it HAS to be that way.

<br />
Health alone is not mitigation, as it also eats up more mana to heal back up and therefor has a negative impact on the healers.<br />
However, with the Guardian mastery, you can take more damage without requiring more healing, which is the essence of mitigation. It may not feel like it because you still eat the full damage, but from an external perspective its fine.<br />
<br />
If you take 1000 damage and require 1000 healing, or you have 20% morer life and take 1200 damage and still require 1000 healing to be filled back up, you basically &quot;mitigated&quot; 200 of that damage through the mastery.<br />
<br />
So TL;DR, Guardian mastery does not only increase the health, but also healing taken, which is &quot;indirect mitigation&quot;. It allows you to take more damage without increasing the healing requirements.</div></div><hr />

Holy cow - the mass and deepness of changes in the class/game mechanics is not good for the game.

Unfortunately it was more like 80% 80% for Guardian in Nighthold, so it will probably skew your perception a bit.<br />

You're not currently in the middle, you're on the very very top. There's a reason pretty much every single raiding guild is using at least one, if not two guardian druids, because they are broken as fuck right now.</div></div><hr />

Must say I'm surprised. Whilst I don't PvP myself I expected this expansion to be the best of them all, given PvP talents, merged crowd control schools as well as gear barely mattering. I wonder if it's simply the case of that Blizzard has stopped caring about PvP because it doesn't have enough participation to warrant their attention?<br />

I like how people that are telling Saaf that burning embers shouldn't be a thing because fire mages, completely ignoring the fact that Destruction Warlock uses fire spells. How does burning embers not make sense for Destros?<br />
<br />
Because Warlocks have always been about using Soul Shards ever since vanilla. Destruction is using fire sure, but the source of their magic is fel magic, which they take from the lives of others. That's also why Warlocks fire is supposed to be green (and the option for it to be so was introduced in MoP).</div></div><hr />

that question has been answered a couple of times now, the spells that cost soul shards as destro are chaos damage which is fel magic that uses souls to function according to that lore book they made about magic. Theres a reason why he is being made fun of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So that its not an over the top buff I would imagine. The ability to proc gore and its damage increased by 400% is quite a large damage buff, having it off the GCD at that point serves no purpose, it would be too spammable for its power level. That seems okay to me&quot;??????&quot;</div></div><hr />

Please read all of my previous comments then before you assume that. All specs using soul shards is silly in my opinion, I think they work in different ways, as Fire Mages don't need souls to power their spells, Destro warlocks shouldn't really either, most of their spells, anyway. but that's all it was, an opinion, but people like you decide to join the bandwagon and add in clearly unthought of &quot;arguments&quot; to continue it.

It's always good to be playing the top tier tank. Being top tier usually means you have abilities that can counter the boss mechanics well, and it's a lot more fun to be in that situation then to be like, &quot;Well fuck... that hurt. Can someone heal me?&quot;<br />
<br />
That said, it's also stupid to whine when you're the top tier tank and you're nerfed. Guardians should expect a nerf right now. I'd just prefer it was more balanced - knock another 10%-20% off ironfur and mark of ursol in half or something.</div></div><hr />

Something would still need to be done about Frenzied Regeneration. Put a cap on it, reduce its healing or whatever is needed, 50 % of damage taken with no cap scales way too well.</div></div><hr />

It's more like 85% of damage taken now, the 4 artifact traits bump it up to 70% and with 20% mastery that's another 14%. It is too strong.</div></div><hr />
