We've received feedback from some of you regarding Heirloom item scaling from levels 91 to 100, particularly in comparison to items available from dungeons. After some discussion, we agree that Heirlooms need to be made more competitive with dungeon items. So, weâ€™ve just applied a hotfix that will increase the item levels of Heirlooms from levels 91 to 100 (live once scheduled maintenance completes). You may still find the occasional item that has slightly higher stats, but the frequency of that happening should be much lower.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the feedback!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah the Garrosh heirlooms were decently scaled the entire time and weren't at a bad spot.<br />
<br />
The normal BoA's I noticed were sitting at like 525 while my Garrosh weapon was at 575 and at 100 it was 600 and Garrosh at 620. So I'd estimate the gear got a 20 iLvL jump would be my guess.</div></div><hr />

Its hard to get excited for something you'll replace in an hour or two. I prefer the 50% XP boost.</div></div><hr />

It's all a matter of opinion. To me, there's really no point since you'll be upgrading that item from a dungeon shortly anyway. Most people tend to stay away from dungeons while leveling as out in the world is faster.<br />
<br />
Myself, and many others, would rather get to 100 fast so we can start the gear upgrades that'll actually matter. The +45% may not seem like much to some, but with that and the +20% pot it was taking me about 30-60 minutes per level depending on what I did and if I didn't afk. Then once I hit max I could go straight into LFR as I did Ashran to get to 615 rather than dungeons. They were boring after the first week when I ran them on my main and haven't touched them since aside from an odd resource daily because I could.</div></div><hr />

I'm up to 10 100s now, 6 of them leveled post 6.1 with full heirlooms, and these items were really low itemlvl compared to even quest drops, much less dungeon drops. In fact, they were often low itemlvls compared to MoP gear on those characters. Of course it was still worth using them for the experience multipliers, but my characters were definitely less powerful.<br />
<br />
Garrosh heirlooms were the exception; those were always pretty good. Oldworld heirlooms scaled much worse, and maxed out at 600. Garrosh heirlooms max out at 620.</div></div><hr />

to a point. dungeons are MUCH faster all the way to about 68. After that queues will slow down if you arent tank or heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, you don't get the xp bonus from non-heirlooms. If you're leveling and in a dungeon and consistently getting drops that are better than the heirlooms you are wearing, you are torn between being behind everyone else stat-wise and keeping them on, or getting rid of them and losing the xp bonus (which defeats the purpose).</div></div><hr />

well then you need to ask yourself. do you want to level up fast or do you want the dungeon drop? i go with the xp boost every time. leveling is tedious,boring, and I hate doing it even since i started playing in bc to now. the faster its over the faster i get to the meat and potatoes of the game. but thats just me</div></div><hr />

Heirlooms should be stronger but only cover specific slots IMO. The issue is heirloom coverage is getting too wide. I think there are less than a handful of slots that are NOT covered by heirlooms now.</div></div><hr />

Effectively sums it all up right here. Leveling hasn't been end-game since classic WoW; it simply serves as a gate to the actual end-game content now. That being said...<br />
<br />
<br />

I don't think every slot should have an heirloom, either. Having an heirloom for every slot would make all the non-heirloom leveling gear fully obsolete, at which point Blizzard would probably not bother with dungeon loot drops at all outside of max level. I know, I know -- you can just elect not to equip any heirlooms, but I personally like having a mix of heirloom with non-heirloom gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, keep in mind that &quot;thousands of gold&quot; doesn't go away. It works across every toon that can use it.<br />
<br />
So if you picked up the Headmaster's Charge and it's no longer the best item at level 94, that doesn't mean you wasted all that gold. Your next caster/healer might not get so lucky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been leveling my toons that I left in the 70's lately and all the queues there are 3-5 minutes. Not necessarily fast but with the speed that the dungeons gets cleared vs the time spent moving between zones when you level rapidly still makes dungeons faster until at least 80. Cata and MoP are short enough level wise (only 5 levels) that moving between zones to not get green or grey quests isn't a problem. From 15-80 though there is little reason to complete quests outside of dungeons if you are going for speed.<br />
<br />
On classes that can heal or tank just do that 15-90 and you can get to WoD content in about 12-15 hours played depending on group quality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think, if they are bothering to go to this point. They might as well make a piece of loom for every slot. They have stated prior that they don't want to do this because they believe at least a few upgrades should still feel worth going after. Most people that are going to use looms in the first place are doing so just to get to the end as fast as possible. They could careless about getting upgrades along the way to cap. This is the reason I won't bother to put all my looms above the 90 cap. Its not like it really takes that much of an effort to get to 100 once you been through the content once or twice and learned the fastest path through to the end. The only reason all my looms are 90, is because they were grandfathered in, otherwise they would never saw 90 either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I was just referencing WoD for the most part since they were referring to the heirloom upgrades at 91-100.<br />
<br />
<br />
Makes sense to spend thousands of gold for a weapon that is outclassed by some blue from a faceroll dungeon right?<br />
<br />
Heirlooms should be stronger but only cover specific slots IMO. The issue is heirloom coverage is getting too wide. I think there are less than a handful of slots that are NOT covered by heirlooms now.<br />
<br />
See...I'd rather have heirlooms all over. There's essentially no point in replacing gear as you level when you start it cap for the main stuff. Leveling should be about leveling, gaining abilities, etc. Maybe some sidegrades on gear that make you choose between bonus, the gear and replacing it with the BoA next level.<br />
<br />
If this was back in Vanilla where you were going to be roughly the same level for quite awhile I'd understand, but now even without BoA's, leveling is pretty fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think every slot should have an heirloom, either. Having an heirloom for every slot would make all the non-heirloom leveling gear fully obsolete, at which point Blizzard would probably not bother with dungeon loot drops at all outside of max level. I know, I know -- you can just elect not to equip any heirlooms, but I personally like having a mix of heirloom with non-heirloom gear.<br />
<br />
Not really. All they have to do is make the normal version then slap heroic + increased ilvl on it and repeat the same gear. So it's not like much effort goes into it. There are plenty of people who still don't use BoA's and use gear leveling.<br />
<br />
To add further to this. Here's a rough idea what they did based on my 97 mage:<br />
<br />
Old level 573 - New level 590<br />
<br />
At 100 this means: Old level 600 - New Level 605.<br />
<br />
So not really much of an improvement once you get to cap. Wish it would've used the scaling the Garrosh weapons did as my staff is sitting at 605 at 97. Not like they couldn't, because you can get 640's in whatever slot you wanted, even if it's capped it wouldn't hurt to let them scale more.</div></div><hr />

Not really. After 95 the curve got hit harder and many of the quest rewards were several ilvls ahead of the heirlooms.</div></div><hr />

However, they are already in enough slots. The dungeon bosses should be adjusted to give more of the off slot items more often. Then, the dungeon quest rewards should be set to give more of the heirloom slot items more often. It should be a higher chance to get items for your off slots and guaranteed for those without looms to get items comparable to them for the slots they occupy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one, but who knows. There was a tweet stating they were going to look at adjusting stats on them so maybe they'll fix ilvls again then too? I really wish that at expansion levels were set to scale to the new versions of that gear.<br />
<br />
Such as:<br />
<br />
60 - To TBC instead of Vanilla<br />
70 - To Wrath instead of TBC<br />
80 - To Cata instead of Wrath<br />
85 - To MoP instead of Cata<br />
90 - To WoD instead of MoP.<br />
<br />
That's just me though.<br />
<br />
Here's the tweet for reference: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16412041719?page=5#85<br />

@WarcraftDevs Could the Polished Helm of Valor possibly get a change? Both it and the Might have Haste, which the Valor set is Crit-based.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the feedback. This and other Heirloom stat changes are being addressed in an upcoming patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be careful, using that logic might offend someone and then they will go on a crusade about how its too efficient to use them to do other wise until blizzard removes the BoA's just like they did flight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, it's not like anyone gives a shit about running dungeons once they hit max lvl, let's just make them completely irrelevant altogether!<br />

Because a vast majority of the player base does not care about dungeon running and only did it because of the rewards. I'd like to see some kind of chart with heroic activity since WoD started compared to other expansions, but realistically no way for us to know without Blizzard &quot;giving/showing&quot; us that.<br />
<br />
I know everyone that I've talked to pretty much stopped running them after the first week and don't even run them on their alts.</div></div><hr />

Hahahahaha :) You're funny, <br />
I only use heirlooms because i wanna have the best gear possible while leveling up in the low levels <br />
And i already have all classes at or close to max, so why would i want bonus XP on the toons i play just for fun? Would gladly replace that useless stuff with more stats :D</div></div><hr />

Heirlooms are only obtainable if you already have a max level character with a high cost. No sane person cares about repeated questing anywys.<br />
<br />
If anything, heirlooms should be the strongest items you can obtain before heroic dungeons, or even LFR.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I kinda want to have the option to turn off the XP boost from the heirloom items. I'm leveling in PVP and really will stop playing at 100, i'd like having the boost of stats (oh boo hoo scaling in pvp, it's still a boost).</div></div><hr />

I questioned if you were joking or not until I read the last line and it was confirmed.</div></div><hr />

I know everyone that I've talked to pretty much stopped running them after the first week and don't even run them on their alts.<br />
Dungeon leveling essentially doesn't exist in WoD because a) the XP payout is too small compared to crunching several quests in the same amount of time; b) still not enough dungeons as compared to 3.0 WotLK (and with less variety IMO); and c) follower missions.<br />
<br />
Especially that last one. I don't have all my alts to 100 yet, but they've been sitting in their garrisons doing follower missions for so long that when they do eventually reach max level, they'll have loads of even 645 gear tokens. So instead of needing to do gearing up the traditional way for pre-raiding, I can just use the tokens and they'll be able to jump straight into LFR.<br />
<br />
So unless Blizzard makes some design changes in the future... /shrug.</div></div><hr />
