It has been my primary alt, my guilty pleasure since vanilla through cata and I thought for sure it was gonna be that way when I picked the game up again. But boy was it.. Meh. In pve at least. In pvp, still fun.<br />
But beyond the meh design, the damage has been.. Wanting. I have no idea how I fail to play the spec so miserably, but clearly I do. I am pulling around 500k dps with this character, and it is wayyy lowest of all my characters. It just isn't fun to play it in pve.<br />
I have 14 characters geared between 920 and 954, and apart from my druid-as-balance, I don't perform as poorly with anyone as I do with my lock, no matter which spec. I even have the affliction leggo helmet. Granted, I have no set pieces, but the stark difference is sickening to me.<br />
Even my warrior, whom I consider myself enjoying but performing sub-optimally with, I breach 960k dps with, single target and no good legendaries (talent ring and trinket for fury, trinket and execute ring got arms). <br />
How am I so unfathomably bad? I line up my ua with artifact ability, and I try to keep one rolling constantly otherwise (contagion).<br />
At once, I am incredulous to the constant nerfs the spec gets (and those wishing for it), and my complete ineptitude to play it at all.<br />
I find it easier to get better results on every single other class and/or spec. Even my one ilevel outlier of Rogue at 904 performs twice as high as assassination (boots and bracers, no sets) than my 936 affliction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's entirely a you-problem, though(and would be fixed by reading some guides, because based on your description of how you play, you're playing around Contagion the wrong way). Affliction is undeniably the strongest DPS spec in the game, and has been fundamentally broken since they tinkered with it around NH. These nerfs, once again, don't really touch the things that make it that broken, though, so that's disappointing. They can keep nerfing the DoTs if they want, but it'll always be a bandaid until they take a look at the artifact.</div></div><hr />

read a guide or something,you clearly are doing something wrong,i was doing 1m+ dps when i was 900 ilvl,affli is stupid strong,figths like coven a 970 lock can keep 3-4 mil dps just constant,a lock did 8 mil dps on eonar,we have amazing single target,decent burst aoe,best sustained aoe,beyond op 2-3 constant targets,more healing than a healer,execute dmg,and on top of it all the rotation is extremly simple</div></div><hr />

You get an achievement for getting to Exalted, which is whats really required for the Unlock, so as long as one character is Exalted, even on the opposing faction, you can start the unlock quest.</div></div><hr />

It's been almost a year and they still haven't addressed the actual issues with Affliction, so chances of WW getting nerfed before BfA seem slim.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because destruction and demo are incredibly weak damage-wise at the moment...<br />

Demo might have some gameplay issues, but you have no reason what so ever to complain about the damage output of either spec overall when the class has at least two very competitive specs and one reasonably strong one.</div></div><hr />

Demo might have some gameplay issues, but you have no reason what so ever to complain about the damage output of either spec overall when the class has at least two very competitive specs and one reasonably strong one.<br />
<br />
If you look at overall damage and range specs, warlocks are p1, 2 and 4... on boss damage even 1, 2 and 3. <br />
<br />
All warlock specs are too strong. But while demo and destro are strong, affliction is miles ahead.</div></div><hr />

You still have to have a 110 on that faction to do the allied race quest line, but once unlocked you're free to roll one of that allied race on any server you want.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verazh</div><div class="date">2018-02-06, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's fun that Horde allied races require &quot;old&quot; reputations (meaning, ones that have been available since release), when Alliance require &quot;new&quot; ones. It stopped playing quite early in the expansion, but I'm exalted with Nightfallen and Highmountain, and I didn't even meet the Alliance ones.<br />
<br />
Good thing I play Horde, then.<br />
<br />
Aff is simple, yet there is finesse required to plan it out. <br />
<br />
But keep Agony up, keep corr up and cast 2-3 UAs depending on how many you have. Dont ever cap shards, always try and keep UAs under the reap buff. So after 2-3 UAs you reap and drain. Im not sure what you mean with &quot;always have 1 UA on target&quot;. That shounds weird</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to be pedantic, the faction rep is not account-wide, the exalted achievement is not account-wide, but there is a hidden achievement that triggers at the same time as the exalted achievement which is account-wide.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tetrisGOAT</div><div class="date">2018-02-06, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's entirely a you-problem, though(and would be fixed by reading some guides, because based on your description of how you play, you're playing around Contagion the wrong way). Affliction is undeniably the strongest DPS spec in the game, and has been fundamentally broken since they tinkered with it around NH. These nerfs, once again, don't really touch the things that make it that broken, though, so that's disappointing. They can keep nerfing the DoTs if they want, but it'll always be a bandaid until they take a look at the artifact.<br />
<br />
<br />
read a guide or something,you clearly are doing something wrong,i was doing 1m+ dps when i was 900 ilvl,affli is stupid strong,figths like coven a 970 lock can keep 3-4 mil dps just constant,a lock did 8 mil dps on eonar,we have amazing single target,decent burst aoe,best sustained aoe,beyond op 2-3 constant targets,more healing than a healer,execute dmg,and on top of it all the rotation is extremly simple<br />
<br />
I am sorry, was my post in any sort of way confusing? My whole point was that it was a me-problem and that I &quot;clearly was doing something wrong&quot;.<br />
And I *have* read multiple guides to try and alleviate this - of course - and as I follow them, I perform even worse. <br />
<br />
What gives you the impression that I blame the spec for being awful? I blame me, completely and fully. I am bad at playing affliction. I also think the spec is amazingly poorly designed as a DPS class, as I am actively juggling every single spec in the game (apart from arcane mage) and can play all of them (apart from affliction, arcane, demo and destruction apparently) really well.<br />
<br />
My point was just meant to be an amusing post about how I completely fail to play the easiest(?) dps spec in the game - or at least the one that people claim it is - that is clearly performing quite admirably, and getting very poor results with.<br />
I am stacking the right stats, playing the way the guides tell me to and do virtually no damage whatsoever.<br />
Yes, I expressed myself poorly in how I played Contagion (I actually play it like Icy Veins tells me to (https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/affliction-warlock-pve-dps-rotation-cooldowns-abilities)).<br />
<br />
I just think it's funny how I think this spec is so difficult to perform with, whilst I had no issue with, say, feral pre-talent rework. Or any of the 'difficult' classes. My fire mage can do 1.5m dps, frost the same. My two ret paladins are at 980k and 1.4m easily. My two Havoc are around the same. Elemental is... fluctuating so I can't say for sure. Enhancement is boring but insane. Windwalker is extremely fun and very rewarding. Hunter specs are.. decent but not great, still double of my warlock. Feral and balance are hectic and confusing at times (I'm forced into the balance cloak legendary which makes it impossible to cast Starfire ever) but still performs great.<br />
Et c. (= I just looked at the alliance characters for now)<br />
<br />
But warlock, yeah, warlock is where I struggle. Enough so that I won't even level my horde one.<br />
<br />
The one thing my post was not, was complaints about how warlock as a whole is producing, or trying to call for buffs. :P</div></div><hr />

2.5% is a kind of joke, the BM is around 14-20% behind other the classes.<br />
