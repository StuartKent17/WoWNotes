No, you get hundred of thousands of gold playing this game normally.<br />

Stop dying and spending it on every single shit on the AH. Repair is the only thing you are required to pay for, otherwise you have no gear.</div></div><hr />

Whatever drugs you're on, I want some. You do NOT make that much gold from playing the game normally. You can make 10k MAYBE by doing all the leveling quests in BfA along with selling all your junk. You absolutely do not get hundreds of thousands of gold by playing the game normally. I play the game normally and I have around 150k gold. I don't buy anything. It's just that the economy has been destroyed on most servers.</div></div><hr />

They are adding more and more gold sinks into the game to make their wow token more viable. If you're a casual player or you only play every so often, you can't farm the necessary gold. Blizzard's recent Q&amp;A's have been really lackluster and they skim content that was meant to be placed in the beginning of an expansion, halfway through or towards the end! Legion was a semi-success, they were improving their connection with their player base up until the end of Legion. Mage towers and new Mythic+ systems + class identity and legendaries made the game more exciting and had far greater content. But now the total lackluster content they have added is terrible. You can ding 120, complete dungeons, with/without friends and be ilvl appropriate within a hardcore evening or 2 days of playing. The challenge is no longer there and they believe that the player base is &quot;too busy&quot; in life to give time to the game. Just another marketing ploy to give people less content and feel more rewarded. <br />
I have stopped playing and I absolutely love this game. It's just not even worth the money anymore.</div></div><hr />

You doing something extremely wrong...even if you are not raiding or flipping in AH, just a little tidbits here and there (getting an alt to collect ore and/or herbs and selling it in AH..not to mention flaskmaking with another alt, or just a herba/alchemy) you can get gold for a token within 1-2 weeks...and I`m talking about little ingame time...if you have a lot of time...huhh...</div></div><hr />

You didn’t need to do it on 10 or more characters. Using just my main I made almost 1 million gold from the table, doing WQs, and running old raids. That’s 1 character and I did it in a substandard way. I didn’t even maximize profits from the mission table. <br />
People that complain about how it isn’t possible just never even tried. They ignored it completely and then complain about it later, just like so many other things in WoW.<br />

Lots of companies don’t have many CS representatives anymore. Why pay people to work when you can have an automated system handle everything that only requires the cost of upkeep?<br />

Uhm... ok I guess?<br />
<br />
I mean I doubt they will remove everyone's gold if the game goes F2P. Or how F2P is relevant to making gold in the game anyway.<br />
<br />
And considering a lot of F2P games I've played have a solid economy I doubt WoW's would be affected in any major way if it ever chose to go F2P.</div></div><hr />

They don't have to remove it, they are letting people spend it on mounts that have inflated prices and tokens.<br />
<br />
A lot of solid f2p didn't have players that had millions of gold at the start either.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is focused on larger audiences, Blizzards biggest problem with WoW right now is the stagnating playerbase; however if they remove the entrance fee's, more people will join and spend money in the shop. Two birds, one stone.<br />
<br />
I don't doubt that it will go free to play, all the changes recently and over the years have made the switch from premium service, to run of the mill.</div></div><hr />

And if people wanna buy tokens to do it then they are free to.<br />

However 333k isn't that hard to make with professions. My Silvermoon alts are sat on 500 from Alchemy and Enchanting.<br />

I mean I personally don't see it going F2P or B2P yet. The need just isn't there yet. It's still one of the biggest money makers for Activision Blizzard if we go by the financial reports and statements.</div></div><hr />

Making gold isn't the problem, wanting to is.<br />

People have noticed that playing the game offer's less and less coin, you have to seek out ways to increase income and a lot of people don't enjoy that type of game play, on top of doing what they enjoy.<br />

After I kill Azshara, that marks the end of the game for me, I'll have done what I want within the old lore by that point. Killed Arthas, Redeemed Illidan, Killed Kil'jaden, defeated Sargaras (wasn't expecting that so soon) and shes the last domino.</div></div><hr />

It sold specs for classes and made most those classes deliberately stronger.<br />

I mean to be fair the layoffs are CS.<br />
<br />
CS just isn't as needed in games like these as it was 10 years ago.<br />

We've had plenty of generic mounts with new skeleton and animations that cost a fraction of the price, unless it had more seats, or vendors on it.<br />

That is what they said years ago when they canned like 600 people, tickets went from &lt;45 minutes to hours, less players and tickets now take days. Calling them wasn't no treat either.<br />

It's not a problem, until you have a problem.<br />

You do not get 333k gold by playing this game normaly. And spare me the &quot;Legion mission tables&quot; rhetoric, because the amount of players that actually did this shit on 10 or more chars is ridiculously small, even though they still somehow managed to ruin server economies.<br />
<br />
Well it's a weird number right? I might need a token. Or two. But that won't be enough. Gotta buy threeeeee tokens heil Activision!</div></div><hr />

Nether rays &quot;price&quot; was that you had to grind rep, if you want to compare the frog, you should compare it to bike, sanddrake, yak, legion spider, warframe or others which price was just gold.</div></div><hr />

Hate to tell you this but not even 5% of the games total mounts (excluding no longer obtainable ones) are behind paywalls. Store mounts make up about 3-4% of the games total currently obtainable mounts (including TCG ones since they can be considered behind a paywall).<br />
<br />
There are plenty of mounts you can earn ingame. If you really want this one then start farming gold or learning to play the AH. There are plenty of professions that are good money makers such as Alchemy and Enchanting.</div></div><hr />

exactly this.<br />
<br />
this is blizzards xmas present to them .... ehhhhrm to you. by getting 5 bugs for doing nothing for every token ever passes the AH, blizz is very happy when ppl buy gold via tokens to buy mounts. make em rich without fixing BfA or delivering quality. <br />
<br />
what shall i say... i play since 2005 without interuption but i stopped collecting stuff in this game. its no more worth it, when you look how heavily they inflate the game with them. its pure cash cow mass recycling shit.<br />
<br />
there was a time in this game when relatively „normal“ ppl (if they provided a good dedication to that game) could collect all the stuff and have fun with that. <br />
<br />
nowadays they shit and piss that much mounts and stuff and copy paste from templates (5 same mounts in 5 diff colors) that NO SANE person could ever collect all that stuff while still play the game normally (raiding etc) without sleeping 1h a day and playing 23h every day.<br />
<br />
my present to blizz for xmas: FUCK YOU. and fuck all your mass shit new style shitty rng bomb the ppl with shit fuck game design. i no longer support it.</div></div><hr />

You can't sell customer service for microtransactions (or atleast they haven't figured out that yet), so CS is just worthless expense that generates them no direct money. Time to cut it down then!</div></div><hr />

<br />
when i read that eurogamer article and hear that they will cut down costs and a „lean 2019“ i cant even imagine how you even more wanna cut down costs in wow than putting in templated WQs, rehashed content (both war fronts), striped down classes, and all that copy paste ballpark mass stuff. ???<br />
<br />
they already are that high in cost effective development, since 90% of their so called QoL changes are only there for cheaper development and since they have autogenerated gear, scenarios build systems and rehash parts (when you look i.e. given mines you realize they are all the same parts, i.e. arathi warfront mine and your WoD garrisson mine), and and and...<br />
<br />
HOW much cheaper and more cost effective they wanna wow ? HOW shall this even work ?<br />

99% agree to that. Wotlk PER SE maybe not. but it started the restructuring of the whole design. as someone that plays without interuption since 2005 i remember myself very good to all the articles in that time and the statements of greg street. the introduction of striped down dungeons with LFD started the show. while wotlk it became very very clear that blizz do not want to target a dedicated audience (mmorpg players) but more the mass audience. shortly after that activision jumped in. <br />
<br />
so ... yes. wotlk was the zenit. upgoing curve till then, downgoing curve after. the hell of today started there.</div></div><hr />

Is it still working? Most of the growth is through services.<br />
<br />
Why do you think Blizzard is investing heavily into the mobile market, for MAU's? MAU's don't mean shit unless people are spending money on MTX. WoW has a shrinking and stagnant player base that hates just about everything Blizzard does.<br />
<br />
They have a ton of low pop servers, they still cost money to run, and no amount of money is enough.</div></div><hr />

If you want to ride around on a mount to be unique then you use a horse or griffon. Almost no one uses those anymore.</div></div><hr />

But every expansion the soul of the game died off further. For me personally, and I will sound cliche, vanilla was the cake with TBC being the cherry on top. WotLK was an extra desert for whoever had room left in their stomach. Everything after that was a great game without soul, without community feeling. Don't get me wrong I've loved the game more than any game from day 1 and this year I tried it again, but like every expansion after TBC i canceled my sub after 2-3 months. This was the last time, I'm done now. The game is dead to me.</div></div><hr />

There's this fancy thing called an auction house, you can actually use it<br />

Bullsh*t. I've played the auction house on alts for years. There's no way to make enough gold by wheeling a dealing on the AH to buy 3 or 4 mounts (varying colors of same design) that cost 333,333/each. <br />
<br />
They're laying off 100 customer service people in order to save money for the top-tier execs. That isn't being done for paying customers. Same goes for ludicrously priced in-game mounts. It's priced to sell the WoW Token. End of story.</div></div><hr />

Okay. Then surely those 3 million gold i made solely from selling herbs in the start of the expansion is merely an illusion, or those 5 millions just from Mission tables back in WoD. You could even get a daily income of 7k back in Legion if you bothered with just a few alts on Mission tables. <br />

On most servers it's literally impossible to make that much money off herbs/ore. Also, you're referencing making money from and expansion that happened 4 years ago. Making gold now is difficult as fuck now.</div></div><hr />
