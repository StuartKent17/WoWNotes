Patch 4.2 Mounts Preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2321-Patch-4.2-Mounts-Preview-Comics)<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to best accommodate players under the unique play style of Rated Battlegrounds, we’ll be offering all-new PvP ground mounts -- the Vicious War Wolf (Horde) or Vicious War Steed (Alliance) -- in a unique way. If you want to sit your knickers on these sweet new rides come patch 4.2, Rage of the Firelands, you must earn achievements for winning either 75, 150, or 300 Rated Battlegrounds. <br />
<br />
One account-bound mount will be awarded for each of these achievements earned, so if you win 300 Rated Battlegrounds with a character, you’ll be afforded the opportunity to give that character and two of your alts each a wolf or steed. Since these mounts are tied to each achievement and not to your placement on the competitive ladder, they will be awarded instantly rather than at the end of each season as with Arena mounts. Your Rated Battleground wins tracked for these achievements are cumulative and are not reset with each season, so you can work toward the reward at your own pace.<br />
<br />

For those of you storming the front lines, protecting vital tactical positions, and keeping your teammates alive in Rated Battlegrounds, we wish you the best of luck in obtaining awards that befit your show of valor!<br />

The wolves look so much better, they look nice and brand new, meanwhile the horses look like the same thing again. Don't get me wrong though, they still look good, I just think the Horde came out ahead again this time with the monts. The horses need to be bulked up a lot and made fuller, their size is otherwise quite wimpy, especially on larger classes, so anything above Humans.<br />

I might be wrong but I'm pretty sure this is subject to Faction conversion. Considering the Horde and Alliance symbols and all.</div></div><hr />

And if so, does that mean they simply removed the seasonal mount rewards for the top 0,5% or will the implent a new one (unless these simply look a lot like the previous seen ones)?<br />

Looks like the pve armors are better to show us it's comming with 4.2 than the new pvp sets (since they look more like the previous season and could not bring the &quot;AMWGOD! IT'S 4.2!&quot; they wanted to the pictures).</div></div><hr />

i beg to differ, i've never been an arena player, nor was i too fond of doing random battleground, but i sure do love the feeling of teaming up with 9 other guild mates and fight another team. And i am yet to find a team of idiots for adversaries (maybe ive been lucky thus far.. Oo)<br />

Why would you be expecting a rare mount reward for anything less than Arena-glad equivalent? <br />

It's pretty disappointing how blizzard keeps removing any form of reward for skill, and particularly for this I think it's a bit of a slap in the face to the people who were grinding all of the 7month season thinking they were going to get a sick rare mount, then it turns out that the damn thing will be common as heck - even I am only a few wins away from getting one and I'm stone guard or something in rateds, and it's obviously going to be possible to get them while even lower.<br />

Why not compare that (and even these wolves too if you want) to all the different mounts available from pve - three different variations on their new firehawk model and that new awesome flaming Anzu. There's really no competition. How about the sets? I know I sure don't like all of the pve sets next tier, but there are some truly standout ones and they're all new and unique to this tier - pvp gear is the same set for an entire expansion, just getting built up with recolours and extra spikes being put on it. I don't even particularly mind that style of gearing for pvp mind you, but it's pretty difficult to say that pvp keeps &quot;getting the best&quot; in wow when so much more development time is obviously poured into pve content.<br />

I think that the Alliance pony carrying Orc, Troll, and undead heads makes up for it. And better than the horde one imo.<br />

It's to bad though, my server doesn't even acknowledge RBG's even exist and nor will I even bother because RBG's are a balanced nightmare. It's all about who can CC more and not actual PvP.</div></div><hr />

Why would you be expecting a rare mount reward for anything less than Arena-glad equivalent? <br />
<br />
Sounds like you're just crying for the sake of crying.<br />
What the fuck are you talking about? Do you even read what you write before you actually post? These mounts were originally suppose to be the gladiator equivalent for rated bgs but it was reversed at the last moment. (Hint, that's why there's 3 of them -- for 3 seasons, just like the drakes.) <br />
<br />
I dislike this change because 1) It lowers the competitive field toward RBGs and discourages players from queueing once they've finished their mount-- &quot;Why bother queueing when I've already got my mount, lol?&quot; 2) It diminishes the value of rated bgs in the competitive community-- &quot;Lol, rated bg's, that's a joke! There no reward besides the stupid title, it's already a faceroll!&quot; <br />
<br />
While you might be happy that you get your cool little mount to jump around Orgrimmar or Stormwind with, I'm trying to point out the bigger picture. It hurts rated bg's as a whole. They're already seen as a joke among many competitive players due to lack of competition (IE. Players see no reward or recognition from it at the end) This change sucks hard and it's certainly not coming from someone that's crying for the sake of crying. In the short, it will be good for rated bgs as more people will queue for rated bgs in the following month or two, but in the long run it will be absolutely devastating to the longevity of rated bgs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realise those mounts were originally suposed to be RBG gladiator mounts equivalent right? 0.5% Reward that many people worked for during all season, only to be given to everyone and their dog at the very end of it.<br />
<br />
Adding new mounts to the game is great, giving away gladiator mounts isn't, what would people say if they gave glad drakes for the 100/200/300 arena games played?</div></div><hr />

Blizzard at its best always, they seem to forget when they were nobody, it wasn't casuals that were buying their games and got them where they are now. I can understand easy-mode pve and stupid achievements to keep them hooked and please shareholders, but must EVERYTHING be aimed towards them?<br />
Err Warcraft 3 and Diablo II were pretty damn big amongst the casual crowd. Starcraft got so big it was the national sport in South Korea years before WoW. WoW was also bought by many non-gamers even back in vanilla. That it has grown so large is mostly due to the appeal to casuals they have.<br />
<br />
And no not everything is aimed towards casuals. The heroic mode raids in PvE are obviously aimed for the hardcore raiders and there is still payoff for being high in Arenas for PvPers. Bliz just wants to promote RBG's and what better way to do it then achievements with mounts you can grind by playing lots of RBG's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is the reason for the mount availability. Some folks will happily chase shiney horse/wolf shaped carrots. <br />
RBG's are rather underperforming at the moment, I DO think a bit more reward would see them rise in popularity which has to be a good thing.</div></div><hr />

I say that from a historical perspective on how Blizzard has treated issues like this one, specifically relating to the High Warlord / Grand Marshal weapons.<br />
<br />
Way back when the original honor system was in place, it was changed so that anyone could grind and purchase the HWL/GM weapons - weapons that had only been available to 1-2 players per faction at a time in any given week. Those initially competing for the weapons invested months of time before the system was relaxed, after which anyone could purchase the weapons after only hours of play. This hit competitive PvPers hard because the product of the accomplishment became a handout. And while the change was likely meant to infuse excitement into the coming arena system and appreciated by the huge majority, it alienated those who had invested a great deal to rank at the best possible level. Eventually (much later), they were given their highest-earned title as a permanent and replacement reward, but the harm was already done.<br />
<br />
Granted, this is a seemingly different Blizzard overseeing the product that is WoW. Perhaps they will handle the current issue differently? Maybe. Personally, though, I wouldn't turn &quot;blue&quot; over it.</div></div><hr />

What the hell are u talking about , getting people for RBGs and making them work together is pain in the ass <br />
<br />
In arena 90% of the time u apply CC and train some poor sod till he dies while in bgs u need a damn tactic and coordination<br />
<br />
Also not to mention that alot of arena wannabes are runing RBGs with 4 healers and FOTM dps classes which kinda ruins the whole RBG feeling...</div></div><hr />

It get's harder at higher rating to win them. Bit silly to say it's something easy. Even tho these mounts are now based on amount of matches won, i do believe those who are at the top of rated battlegrounds should get something similar, or even better. Considering there has to be atleast _some_ effort done, i do not think that the high rated people should complain too much. That said, i do believe Blizz could've handled this different. As in: Instead of giving these mounts as the awards, offer something else. These mounts seem a bit too prestigious look wise to be given as a x amount of matches won reward. Like; a lesser armored mount, or with no flag. You get the idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you for real? Of course people want to feel accomplished for doing things, else why bother at all? You're so full of yourself, getting stuff *handed* to you isn't fun, and it has nothing to do with subscription fee. Or are you so bad that doing the easiest things feels hard to you and make YOU feel accomplished because you pay 15 dollars too? That's egoistic and stupid. There's nothing as unrewarding as just 'getting', almost by accident, like these mounts will.<br />
<br />
Also has nothing to do with hardcore vs casual... Just everything with effort vs no effort.<br />
<br />
(not that I care about these mounts, seeing as I don't even do RBGs, I just care about the attitude of some people, like yours).<br />
<br />
Edit: There's nothing wrong with being bad as such, just to clarify. Just this whole.. &quot;I want everything because I pay 15 dollars too!&quot; thing that's pissing me off. No, sorry, that's not how effort works.</div></div><hr />
