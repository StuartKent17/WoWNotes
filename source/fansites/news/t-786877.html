<br />
<br />
&lt;table class=&quot;sortable newz-table&quot;&gt;<br />

Enchanting your ring causes it to become soulbound and requires 475 Enchanting skill to remain active.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Companion Pets<br />
Enchanters get their own craftable pet! The Enchanted Lantern (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/93841/enchanted-lantern/) will be available for Horde Players and the Magic Lamp (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/93843/magic-lamp/) for Alliance. <br />

i think it has something to do with leaves blowing in the wind, which is probably what it will look like while swinging, so my bet is wind == supah agile</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually 50 dodge rating is way more ivalue than 40 Stamina (which is the equivalent of 26.67 dodge rating). Also in Cata, tanks will not itemize for Stamina only. If you are a mana sponge, your healers will go oom and you will die. When you are not in danger of dying in a short window of time, the effective health theory goes out of the window and when preventing excessive healing becomes the new priority, avoidance and mitigation are your new gearing concerns. In Cata I expect that you will want to keep a certain health pool appropriate to the raiding tier you are in, and then everything else goes to avoidance (unless you can get mitigation through armor or if it proves to be superior, block capping).</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the mending enchant used nearly the exact same leaf look, and their is a wind enchant<br />
<br />
<br />
Weapon	Windwalk	Permanently enchant a weapon to sometimes increase dodge rating by 600 and movement speed by 15% for 10 sec when striking in melee.<br />
<br />
I am not trying to QQ, I mostly ponder what they were thinking, you may be right, they may be thinking windy/nature = agile</div></div><hr />

They already mentioned they're going to be reworking scopes as a replacement for enchants and make them so that they're basically hunter-only. I'll see if I can't find the quote...</div></div><hr />

Yes, casters can now enchant their off-hands.

So it's kind of nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
stacking stam is not gonna be all that smart in cata<br />
<br />
I'm so glad for this. I hated the stam stacking idiots in Wrath. &quot;HURRR DURRR I HAS 50K HP I R 4 TANK WHEEEEEE!&quot; Then he gets hit, and I've gotta frantically spam my heal to top him off before the next big hit comes because he's got no fucking mitigation. So many fail tanks in ToC/ICC stacking HP to their eyeballs. They take even a small hit from something even like Icehowl and a chunk of their HP falls off and the healers all squawk and start spamming.<br />
<br />
I can always spot a good, easy to heal tank from a bad one who think that just because he's a sack of hit points he's an effective tank. Sure, you can wave all that bullshit in my face about stam stacking being &quot;a viable tanking stat&quot;, but a tank who actually thinks about his mitigation and block will be a MASSIVELY easier tank to heal than one who just stuffs epic stamina gems into all his gear, and you can take that to the fuckin' bank.<br />
<br />
Please, tanks, for the love of anyone who'll heal you. Stop fucking stacking stamina and learn that there are other stats besides goddamn HP. With the mana/healing changes, your shitton of HP isn't going to mean jack or shit when you've run the healers OOM because all you're doing is taking hits to the face.</div></div><hr />

I pretty much agree. I honestly wouldn't mind so much if the leaves and snowflakes weren't so obviously fake looking. Or the glows were so UTTERLY over the top that it'd block weapon design.<br />

Personally, I think there should be a hide weap enchant option - much like hiding helm and cloak.</div></div><hr />

Exactly what I thought when I saw this video, even with the current enchants you can lose the weapon's design, and their awesome natural glow, this was the worst with the Algalon dagger that looked amazing, but once enchanted looked absolutely horrible.<br />
By all means, use those insane graphics on some unique weapons instead (or even a legendary), but if everyone is running around with weapons that are glowing in the same 'over the top' way, then it can take away from the individuality that is already at risk nowadays.</div></div><hr />

All the Runeforge enchants are percentage based rather than a straight &quot;Get an extra $x of $stat&quot;. That means they scale with gear. On the bright side it means our enchants get better as our gear gets better. On the downside there's no real need for new ones, so we'll probably just use the same old thing.</div></div><hr />

That and people afraid of the weapon enchants overwhelming the weapon art: keep in mind that Boubouille's using a model viewer to preview these. Model viewers are notorious for getting animation opacity/intensity incorrect from the real, intended animation. People who've used modelviewers in the past will be able to understand this.<br />

Well their &quot;over the top&quot; effect kinda makes sense since most of them are procs and it acts as an indicator letting you know your proc has gone off in the middle of the fight if you're not used to staring at the top right corner of your screen. <br />

The enchants are extraordinary, people complain about everything. Too much effects, people complain. Not enough, people complain. I love them, hopefully they're something in the middle, like a low effect all the time then when they proc they look like they do in the video. If it's not, it's ok with me. I hope the rest of the game has spell effects like that first one.<br />

stacking stam is not gonna be all that smart in cata<br />
<br />
Same was told before LK, but we had stam &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; all.<br />
Since tanks won't have extended lifepool from other classes in Cata, stam is probably going to be most valuable stat. While tanks are low health by pattern they will want as much additional stamina as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The situation is totally different. <br />
<br />
In WotLK healers had nearly infinite mana pools and most tanks were hitting harsh DR on the ratings. Stacking stamina also bought your healers response time, as it took 3-4 hits instead of 2 before you died, so that healers got an extra 1-3 seconds to respond to that burst. <br />
<br />
In cataclysm healers run out of mana in a fight. It will be way better to avoid a hit so that you won't have to get healed, than constantly take those hits. On top of that bosses hit relatively(!) for less so healers have more time to respond in general. So yea avoidance and mitigation will definitely be higher up on the wanted list than they are currently, and stamina will be lower.</div></div><hr />

I just hope Hurricane wont end up as the Cata Black Magic™ which was generally frowned upon =( I never set foot in beta but I'm crossing my fingers for one day stacking haste to ridicilous amounts again as it is without a shred of doubt the most awesome secondary stat (assuming it's viable in terms of deeps obviously).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can always spot a good, easy to heal tank from a bad one who think that just because he's a sack of hit points he's an effective tank. Sure, you can wave all that bullshit in my face about stam stacking being &quot;a viable tanking stat&quot;, but a tank who actually thinks about his mitigation and block will be a MASSIVELY easier tank to heal than one who just stuffs epic stamina gems into all his gear, and you can take that to the fuckin' bank.<br />

I totally agree it would be better not to have bosses hitting tanks for 50%+ of tanks HP. Coz if two attacks like that will pass all avoidance (there's always a chance), tank will die before healed.<br />

Sure, you can wave all that bullshit in my face about stam stacking being &quot;a viable tanking stat&quot;, but a tank who actually thinks about his mitigation and block will be a MASSIVELY easier tank to heal than one who just stuffs epic stamina gems into all his gear, and you can take that to the fuckin' bank.<br />
You are an idiot, just plain and simple. The math has already been done, and done again, and done again, and done some more for good measure. I seriously doubt you have any clue with eh is, or how it's calculated, or why it is even important. <br />

Please, tanks, for the love of anyone who'll heal you. Stop fucking stacking stamina and learn that there are other stats besides goddamn HP. With the mana/healing changes, your shitton of HP isn't going to mean jack or shit when you've run the healers OOM because all you're doing is taking hits to the face.<br />
<br />
Again with the &quot;I don't want to do my job, you should make me not have to&quot;. How about you roll tank. When I heal I love high hp tanks, you know why? Because you can stack all of the avoidance you want, if you go down in one hit NOTHING I do can save you. If it takes 3 hits to kill you, I can save you. If you are going OOM healing like that, then I suggest the tank isn't your problem. Perhaps your dps needs to wake the hell up and do their job? Or maybe you should be a better healer? Or maybe your dps should take some mitigation talents. To me this is a pure and simple matter of healers being lazy. That's all there is to it. Which is fine, gtfo. On my server there are more healers than there are tanks by far. If you aren't capable, there are others that are. <br />
<br />
As for the silly debate over &quot;is a small amount of dodge worth more than a small amount of stamina&quot;. High, diminishing returns want's to talk to you. You don't know what that is? No surprise there. See with avoidance the more of a stat you have, the more you need. <br />

<br />
So once you reach a certain point, and mostly this is reached with gear, there is almost no point to stacking it because you would have to sacrifice so many other stats to reach it. <br />
<br />
O.k. you want to say &quot;well I would like the tank to have more avoidance&quot; Well what if your tank had to give up 1000 health for .1% dodge. Would you call that good? 40 stam is very nice because it does not decrease in value. It adds more hp no matter how much of it you stack.</div></div><hr />
