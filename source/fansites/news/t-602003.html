He blew through the entire story. He has to wait for others to level to do anything now. And now that he has his epic flying mount... I guess now he just has to rep grind and grind kara. Woo, that sounds like fun.</div></div><hr />

Besides, I wouldn't be surprised if he rolls a blood elf paladin or something like that, like the mage from Millenium did.<br />
<br />
One thing I'm curious about though, what happened to the anti-addiction debuff that the Chinese servers are required to have? I thought that would put an end to anything like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No screenshot, it was accidently put into the EU/US PTR clients at around 1.10/1.11. Blue confirmed that it was a mistake and that it was only intended for the chinese client.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
he's probably one of them farmers that powerlvls characters to 70 for a living...having done every tbc quests 100's of times, knowing every quest mob &amp; location blindfolded<br />
<br />
.. or else he got a raid to help him kill stuff he pulled, and then went non-stop pulling, pretyt much giving loads of XP every odd second.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah,and I assume a great part of his guildmates also grinded 70 on a PTR / non-chinese server, making then know the zones very well, what the Millenium guy couldn't get.<br />
<br />
Even if I disaprove that kind of grinding, great job to our friend &amp; Green base guild !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because obviously, the Millenium guys didn't know anything about the game when it was released, and none of them participated to the BC Beta tests.<br />
<br />
Edit: Not denying its sure more of an accomplishment on Day 1 rather than now, but &quot;knowing the content&quot; matters few at this point.</div></div><hr />

ture, but dont forget they have 8 more months NAXX farming than us, lots of them full on t3.<br />

<br />
l2farm?<br />
and btw. i'm not supprised that a chinese guy pulls this off, it's just another proof that chinese people can do just about anything.<br />
As long as he doesn't go goldfarming and start a crappy site where you can buy wowgold online and then spam ingame trade chat.. it's ok with me ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legionn</div><div class="date">2007-09-08, 07:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO pulling off a power leveling like Millinium did was more of an accoplishment since it was done at the release. The 8months that Green Base has had to do tons of research and practice on the ptr means just that.</div></div><hr />

nothing wrong if he knows how to play a hunter, good dps, good cc with his traps<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Millenium's accomplishment much greater, as previously stated, due to the fact that GreenBase had 8 months to practice.<br />
didn't millenium had months in the beta aswell? or didn't they had a spot in there?<br />
<br />
<br />

you need to install east asian languages from your windows cd via some options in the configuration pallet, someone else should be able to explain this better ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
My friend leveled his lock to 70 in ~34 hours solo, we thought for sure he was the first one, but then the guy from milenium did it a few hours ahead of time. Oh well, in our opinion, he cheated, but he won. And I think he would of won if he didnt take a 7 hour nap. -.-</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jikuu</div><div class="date">2007-09-08, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">- That's 4802.7 XP / minute for the whole time without any pauses.<br />
- Take 1 hour off for expless traveling and it raises to 5016.5 XP / minute. Five THOUSAND, EVERY minute. That's something to think about. ;)</div></div><hr />

Simply because this is not the hunter who took the screenshots (but a Mage and a Druid) !<br />
<br />
Gratz anyway.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juju</div><div class="date">2007-09-10, 08:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's quite something, good for him!<br />
I wish i could have lvl'd that fast... I read someone saying it was pointless, but the game is only ever really enjoyable at 70 anyways, the rest is just something they make you do to understand your skills and stuff (yes, I know, I don't think icelance or CoS for rogues takes that long to master, but w/e some people I meet still don't seem able to use it properly...)<br />
I bet he's been sleeping since he hit 70 lol</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apollojoe</div><div class="date">2007-09-10, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Come on im sure gold farmers wouldn't bother to do that kind of carzy thing.<br />
he is just a wow addict(no offense to him here believe me) and what he did is just lvling to 70 4hours faster than the previous euro guy.<br />
<br />
a bit more, there are definitly NOT as many Gold farmers in chinese servers as there are in US/EU servers, the simple reason being is that technically, what they're doing is at your servers..farming the gold...and sell it to those people living in richer countries(and thats who you guys are lol), earning dollars/euros and spending them in China which is relativly poorer, thats what make senses. theres no point farming gold in their native servers. Just hope you could see this fact. Yes im a native chinese and from what i saw, there perhaps are not so many farmers in here as some of you predict. and in conclution, this silver-dragon lvls to 70 just for fun(or fame probably but thats ok), not for gold farming or anything. <br />
p.s I know my english sux sorry<br />
also, one last thing, i donot know him personally but i do know this guy is a internet hacker or something, like, real pro...so,guess i was wrong when i call him a no-life mmo addict- -</div></div><hr />
