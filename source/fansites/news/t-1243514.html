Blue Tweets<br />
Character<br />
Did devs take into consideration how cost prohibitive upgrading is? its next to impossible to fully upgrade your BiS slots.<br />
One can argue maybe the game was better when everyone didn't have the expectation of BiS in every slot... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279061311256666112))<br />
<br />
is it safe to say brawlers guild may promote gold buying as people who may not have time to farm gold would wanna try it out?<br />
Gold farming sucks, but we can't be terrified about having a gold economy in the game. Gold having no value sucks too. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274966108975538176))<br />
<br />
Do you think that the visual design of abilities and gear influences which classes are more popular and most played?<br />
Absolutely. Maybe not for everyone but I believe it contributes a lot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/277535605859180544))<br />
<br />
Getting a bit of gear is too complicated; enchant, gem, reforge (all of your gear) and now upgrade. Gem &amp; Ench only was good.<br />
We actually agree with this. Once upon a time you got to put on the gear that dropped when it dropped. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276504529900539904))<br />
Amen. Please remove reforging. Also eliminates need to go to external sites to tell you how exactly to reforge.<br />
We think reforging feels fine for everything except hit and expertise. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276777723953823745))<br />
If you agree, why did you just bring in the upgrade system the other week?<br />
You don't need to upgrade a piece to wear it. You do need to enchant, gem and reforge. Reforge may be the biggest problem. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276752871893127168))<br />
<br />
last question, did you even consider letting people focus on whatever aspect they enjoy most to progress?<br />
Within reason. E.g. you can't do achievement to progress. Also what you enjoy may be supported but may not be most efficient. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/276776274217816064))<br />
<br />
How is the new race models going along? It's the only thing that is gonna get me back. Anything more than Dwarf and Orc done?<br />
We're excited about them but it's hard to say much more without every word getting over-analyzed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279648672424280064))<br />
OMG, GC said new models will be amazing and perfect and are almost done!!! /sarcasm<br />
Exactly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279659059832053760))<br />
<br />
.What makes it worse is talents actually at 0% use because either one talent was to well designed or others suck.<br />
Warrior talent diversity isn't actually bad, with a couple of exceptions like Second Wind. Mage talent diversity is too low. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279405268570365952))<br />
the only pve fight that any competitive fury warrior will use storm bolt for is garalon. Balanced?<br />
No, we think it's a little weak in both PvE and PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279652795735498752))<br />
<br />
Just curious as to why we have the mechanic that sets mana to zero when switching specs? <br />
If the switching cost is too low then it feels like you are supposed to do so every pull, especially for healers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279404059876806656))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Opinion on double healer comps in 3v3? Should they be viable? Saw 2600 double healer frost mage before today's Frost Bomb nerf<br />
We are generally fine with non-standard comps as long as they are somewhat uncommon. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279018793026613248))<br />
<br />
Greg, It looks like you are giving burst classes more advantages than dot classes with the mass PvP Power and 1 min trinket<br />
More frequent small bursts is generally a nerf to burst strategies. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279648353472626688))<br />
you explain the nerf part, Please ?<br />
It is generally easier to counter being hit twice for 200K with a short break in between than one hit for 400K. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279657418059837440))<br />
<br />
Wondering if you're aware of the current talk in arena: feral is OP, frost mage is dead, and healers are too weak; comment?<br />
Feral does seem to be at the top of everyone's hit list now that mage, warrior and hunter are toned down. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279655564290686976))<br />
<br />
I love how Druids can vanish and ShStep BETTER than rogues and about 6x more often... kudos man. you are a master of balance.<br />
One ability compared to another ability doesn't scale to one class' comparison to another. It's about the whole package. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279405596879495168))<br />
<br />
do u think melee damage is out of control atm? specifically feral/dk/warrior... esp w/ healing debuff its just unhealable...<br />
Feral, maybe. DK no. Warriors have been nerfed a ton lately. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279063460069928960))<br />
<br />
prot warrior stands and lets me get him to 35%, kills me (rogue). Having a fantastic time. What class do you want me to play?<br />
Tanks aren't designed to be killed. That's why we don't push them into Arenas. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279064488735543296))<br />
<br />
me and a lot of healers need to be talked off a ledge. I'm sure there's a reason behind the changes we just aren't seeing.<br />
Strategically, burst and perma CC are the only options when healers can keep everyone up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279062090122153984))<br />
Disc priest anyone? Oh nevermind, they dont exist in arena anymore thanks to lazy blanket nerfs.<br />
When healing is too powerful overall, the solution is not to let some specs still have healing that is too powerful. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/279644822099337216))<br />
<br />
UI / Addons<br />
hey - is there some sort of UI notice to tell you *if* you bought the extra rep for a faction?<br />
There is not, but we agree that we need to add one. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/274968626212249602))<br />
<br />
the issue isn't mods changing talents, its the ui becoming broken because of unrelated taint (caused by blizzard ui bugs)<br />
I'll say again, taint = accessing something we want protected. We can decide to make it !protected, but that does take some work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278687874059223041))<br />
- The problem is it can be reproduced without any mod's. Which should be addressed. Global variable is tainting.<br />
There isn't much technical distinction between mods and macros. You're still trying to access something we want to protect. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278618814776758272))<br />
<br />
Please stop being so restrictive about the Glyph/Talent UI. It's driving people nuts, I loathe the moment I have to change!<br />
Philosophically, we don't want automating talent or glyph swaps. Once it's easy to reglyph every pull, players feel like they must. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278572849529245697))<br />
<br />
He's Lead Systems Designer. A lot of people take for granted exactly what &quot;systems&quot; entails in game design.<br />
Balance is a pretty small portion of what I do. It's just one many forum posters / twitter users care a lot about. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275738454111973376))<br />
What's the big portion of what you do?<br />
Future planning, UI, and then just pure people management take the biggest portion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275765732439126016))<br />
For UI, do you work on the backend of making things work, user end experience, or something else?<br />
I design UI from the PoV of features and goals. We have actual graphic designers also and then engineers to hook it all up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275771943557419008))<br />
Do you sometimes feel that WoW's UI is getting over-complicated? I often can't find stuff after 7 years...<br />
Yes, I do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275981711358193667))<br />

I don't think I can imagine anything else in my mind that has been so built up with anticipation over the years, i love the models in this game and can only dream of what my classic favorite races will look like with the artistic flare and style and expression Blizzard is now capable of. I'll probably level each new model for each race to at least level 20 or so before the shiny new models wear out their wow factor. I can just imagine walking around Dun Morogh with snow flakes slowly falling as my new dwarf beard sways about with cartoon life. Or running along Teldrassil and watching my new Night Elf's ears bounce around. i can't wait to let my eyes drink in the new gradients and colors on their skin. I really hope the animations are given more bounce and oomph and animated character too.<br />

<br />
I REALLY hope they're kidding... If they remove reforging hit/exp to a cap, min/max-ers are going to be forced to gem for it (so when you get a new piece of gear that doesn't have the same stats as the previous one, you're going to be forced to buy 4-6 gems instead of the usual 1-3). Reforging is fine, if you don't want to use any addons for it, don't expect to have perfect stats, it really isn't necessary - being 50 points below/over hit cap won't change anything...</div></div><hr />

What is that? 56Kbits? Sounds horrible. (The compression, not the music)<br />
<br />
<br />
I REALLY hope they're kidding... If they remove reforging hit/exp to a cap, min/max-ers are going to be forced to gem for it (so when you get a new piece of gear that doesn't have the same stats as the previous one, you're going to be forced to buy 4-6 gems instead of the usual 1-3). Reforging is fine, if you don't want to use any addons for it, don't expect to have perfect stats, it really isn't necessary - being 50 points below/over hit cap won't change anything...<br />
<br />
Aye. I hate these idiots that are constantly whining. Reforging is a great thing and I do not want to see it gone.</div></div><hr />

Another is class balance. Like Diablo II, Diablo III was designed to be a PvE-first kind of game, where we never compromised on player abilities in the name of future PvP balance. We want to be able to carry over as many of the crazy runes, items, and skills as possible, with their crazy effects, and alter them as little as possible. In a casual PvP mode, something equivalent to a WoW Battleground, this would be fine, but Team Deathmatch felt very hardcore, and it put a laser focus on class balance in a way that we didn’t think would be good for the game as a whole.<br />
<br />
So Blizzard still does have some balls and sticks to their ideals. Good one.</div></div><hr />

Actually - no they didn't cause if they had any brains to go with those balls they had realised that PVP would never have worked. They were told months ago by the players. Coming out 7 month after game was released is a total disgrace and shows the unprofessional work that goes on at BLizzard. <br />
<br />
Many players are pointing out how the new systems in MOP are pushing the game in a horrible direction. All we hear from BLizzard is arrogance and naivity. I doubt they even have balls.<br />
<br />
<br />
In this case about fanboys trying to avoid the pvp scrap - I was ofc talking about one line in this news topic that didn't even mention it had been scrapped. And the fanboy in that case was MMO-Champion.</div></div><hr />

I'll say again, taint = accessing something we want protected. We can decide to make it !protected, but that does take some work.<br />

Does !protected mean &quot;not protected&quot;? Please, do it then. <br />

The customer knows what they want. Its called content. Something that BLIzzard is not providing in any quality or quantity. They managed to build a small pile of content by leaving the live servers unattended for 8 months. Dragging out thigns with endless lines of dailies and gear double gated with rep and valor does not hide the real issues.<br />
<br />
MOntly subscription based game should offer content every month. Its that easy and with 10 million subs Blizzard has no excuse to not do that. OFC other than spending most of the WOW money and dev time on Titan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah so you're one of these deluded people that think that if they throw enough money at a problem it'll go away?<br />
<br />
There is TONS of content in MoP. <br />
I don't think the bulk of the player base would be anywhere near ready for a new raid right now. <br />
Only 37% of the raiding population killed GARALON (10man and 25man combined).<br />
In case you're not up to snuff with boss names: Garalon is the 3rd boss in Heart of Fear, meaning that 63% of the rading population is at 8/16 NORMAL right now.<br />
<br />
Hell, even my own Guild hasn't killed 25-Sha normal yet.<br />
<br />
Ofc if you don't raid or only do &quot;Looking For Retard&quot; then I could understand that you are bored. <br />
Simple question though: How did you manage the other 6-8 years of WoW w/o access to raiding?</div></div><hr />

WOW is on its last meters on so many levels now. The main reason is because the developers have not been doing their job over the last few years to improve many of the core features of the game. That includes outdated content update system that will not stand a chance against F2P games where you dont have to pay monthly subs. <br />
<br />
BLizzard managed to keep Cata in 9 millions by giving the expansion for free towards the end. And they got mop to 10 million but thats the lowest number of any WOW expansion. At the same time players are finding out exactly what the new &quot;content&quot; is in MOP. Its called dailies and you dont have to look for long to see what most ppl think about it. Even big name players that played WOW for years are claiming MOP raids are some of the worst seen in any expansion. It will not hold ppl interested over the next 4-5 months until next tier is out. PPL will be leaving and playing better value games rather than doing dailies. Some might return for 5.2 but I guess most will simply remember the horror of dailies and see that 5.2 has new batch of them to gate their &quot;content&quot;</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, what? Content EVERY MONTH? Who asks for that? Who can consume that? Such a request is borderline insulting at best, and insane at worst. The vast majority of the player base doesn't finish all the content of a patch now, how on earth would it be feasible to do it all in a month? Hell...you can't even develop and code content in that time and make it worth while. Basically what I'm saying is that you're wrong on every count, and you should probably step back a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not talking about 13 boss raid tier every month. Neither am I talking about adding new stuff to every aspect of the game every month. 1 fresh dungeon for 5 man content - new world boss and so on. Thats something that really would keep ppl coming back every month. The current format does not work. I think DS for 8 months just goes to show that. It was the first content with lfr - and now we are getting the second tier with that. It gives ppl the feeling they have done all the raid content and they will unsub cause waiting in LFR Qs and doing dailies with alts does not sound very interesting to most.<br />
<br />
The idea behind more content more frequent sounds good. BLizzard needs to get that feeling back that monthly sub is actually offering fresh content for that month. RIght now all expect 8 months of nothingness in between content patches. Great way to pay 2 months per year for the game as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's funny how Duster505 did not manage to answer my last post with statistics about why it would be a bad idea to release 5.2 right now, even if it would be already finished.<br />
As there is only a finite amount of content that can be created per month, there is also a finite amount of content the NORMAL player can consume. (Hardcores pretty much gobble everything right up, but guess what: they are NOT the bulk of the player base)<br />
<br />
Syncing up the development and consumption rates is where the optimum lies, and blizzard closely monitors this. Ofc, like in any REAL WORLD working environment, stupid stuff happens that delays releases. I don't think Blizzard really wanted a 12 months ICC or a 8 months DS. But stuff happened that forced them to delay. Hell Sunwell plateau was implemented because Wrath got delayed.<br />
<br />
Contrary to popular belief Blizzard is not out there to see how long they can torture people.</div></div><hr />

Possibly Mr. Street's finest tweet in the history of ever since it looks like a watershed moment that he's finally acknowledged they created this monster when they stripped gating from raids, handed out gear through massive nerfs, handing out legendaries like candy and started playing the game &quot;everyone's a winner&quot;. Good luck trying to put the #$!&amp; back in the horse since WoW is now widely regarded as the least challenging of any MMO out there. <br />
<br />
People will make the demands of BIS because that's the carrot you put in this game after years of people looking at top end raider's gear and whining they never get to see the different raid tiers, subs will drop again, they'll cave, and everyone will get what they want because we just can't have a million whiners leave. Sucks because I like this title and I don't want to have to invest my time in another title atm.</div></div><hr />

I did not answer your last post cause it was not worth answering. Even if PTR comes up for 5.2 today everyone knows that the raid content will not be coming anytime soon - simply because its not close to ready. PTR coming up is just PR from Blizz and probably mainly focused on getting better PVP balance tested. <br />
<br />
It does not matter why ppl were stuck with ICC for 12 months and DS for 8. They failed to deliver content with regular intervals like ppl expected. Like subscribers expect. <br />
<br />
And just so you know - I work full time job and have a family to feed. Thats why I expect a computer game that I pay monthly subscription for to actually allow me to play the game when I come online for the little spare time I have. I have finished the normal raiding tier pretty easily with 3 raiding days per week. I have seen more of the &quot;content&quot; than most of the unemployed nubs have. But I will not waste 1 min more of my spare time while the developers leave the game in its current state of horrible managment including hour long LFRs Qs because they failed to support a strong trinity based gameplay. Instead they went full out DPS support in scenarios and daily quests and Brawlers guild. Alts might be getting past the first hurdle of rep grinds - but 1 hour of LFR Qs will force most ppl out next few weeks and months.</div></div><hr />

Doubtful.<br />
People may bitch and moan, like you do, but most won't quit for good. <br />
This may come as a newsflash to you, but many people don't play / subscribe continuously. They do what they want after a patch release, and when they're done they unsub till the next patch.<br />
Blizzard stated themselves that subscription numbers aren't as static as most people believe.<br />
<br />
Just out of curiosity: If you're a raider, why do you care about stuff like Brawlers guild, Scenarios and LFR-Queues? It's not exactly your type of content anyway. <br />
If you finished normal raiding easily, the next logical step would be heroic raiding. <br />
I just want to know why you bitch so much about WoW being &quot;mean&quot; to tanks and healers, when it's actually the most accommodating MMO out there. oO<br />
<br />
Scenario as a healer: No probs, let your guild mates go crazy.<br />
Daily questing as healer: No probs, let your group-mate play &quot;all you can add&quot;. Most quest drops are shared now, so it doesn't even take longer to &quot;farm 6 bracelets&quot;. (Don't try to bullshit me here, I'm doing these quests with a tank friend every day and it is way faster than doing them alone as a cloth dps)<br />
<br />
Brawlers guild is the only thing you really can't do as a non-DPS, but imho the fact of queuing for a battle and having people watch what you do is not very appealing anyway. <br />
Besides: If I understand it right, it doesn't award anything but achievements.</div></div><hr />

WOW is trying to counter GW2 with supporting DPS to the top this expansion. Other roles in the game are suffering and it leads to less balance overall in the game. . Alot of guilds are struggling big time to fill needed roles. As for me - My guild lost 4 players in the last 2 weeks to RIFT. 3 healers and main tank. More ppl are leaving and we no longer even bother to do raids. And my guild is not the only one. Its happening all over the game.<br />
<br />
As for why I feel MOP is unfriendly to Tanks, healers and multi-role characters? It is. Dailies are created to be most efficient for DPS - scenarios were added to shorten the LFD Qs. And MOP launched with least amount of 5 man trinity dungeons ever. But now... few months into the game - LFR Qs have grown endless cause of all of the DPS focus. And even worse... because of the role loot system where the few tanks and healers that are left are actually Qing up as DPS to get gear for Dailies and Brawlers Guild. <br />
<br />
If you do the math - you can easily find out how bad the valor upgrade system will be for players that are playing 2 roles equally. Those players will always be on avarage about 20 item lvls lower in both roles. Thats why many are now going RIFT because of strong support for multiroles. <br />
<br />
As for Brawlers guild... it not a question about what it offers... its a question about locking ppl out of PVE content in the game based on role you play. It was the last straw for alot of players cause it showed how Blizzard had put zero thought into balancing the core of the game. And the core of WOW is and has always been based on roles. They lost it now - and it can be very hard to get ppl back. Specially tanks and healers that are good enough to bother with top end content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When was this? Vanilla? I've gone after BiS every expansion after that and have even gotten it in the last 2. I really want to find it now, but in the past I have definitely seen blue posts about class balance that say they use end raiding gear to make those balancing decisions. This especially hurts classes that gear helps more than others that find themselves at the bottom of damage or healing until they finally get that full tier set and can be on equal footing. A lot of blue posts in the last year or so have been similar to this. They seem like they are just little bandaids to cover up the big problems, and even then they feel like they get REALLY defensive about it. This and a lot of other blue tweets and posts have just angered me and I'll stop now before I get too riled up again!</div></div><hr />

Other roles in the game are suffering and it leads to less balance overall in the game. . Alot of guilds are struggling big time to fill needed roles. As for me - My guild lost 4 players in the last 2 weeks to RIFT. 3 healers and main tank. More ppl are leaving and we no longer even bother to do raids. And my guild is not the only one. Its happening all over the game.<br />
<br />
As for why I feel MOP is unfriendly to Tanks, healers and multi-role characters? It is. Dailies are created to be most efficient for DPS - scenarios were added to shorten the LFD Qs. And MOP launched with least amount of 5 man trinity dungeons ever. But now... few months into the game - LFR Qs have grown endless cause of all of the DPS focus. And even worse... because of the role loot system where the few tanks and healers that are left are actually Qing up as DPS to get gear for Dailies and Brawlers Guild. <br />
<br />
If you do the math - you can easily find out how bad the valor upgrade system will be for players that are playing 2 roles equally. Those players will always be on avarage about 20 item lvls lower in both roles. Thats why many are now going RIFT because of strong support for multiroles. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry about your guild dieing, but that has nothing to do with the topic at hand. People leave wow all the time and many raiders dislike dailies per se.<br />
<br />
MOP is no more unfriendly to Heal/Tank as all the other xpacs. Yes tank questing damage was lowered quite a bit, but w dualspec that isn't a problem, even if you insist of soloing in a MMO. 5.1 did something to LFR queues, I don't know what but I doubt that it's the issue you're bringing up. Your issue would affect LFR Q gradually but I went from 4 minutes as DPS to an hour within a day. Maybe they broke something behind the scenes and didn't tell us, I don't know.<br />
<br />
I do not need to do the math at all. Even if you want to fully upgrade ONE SPEC you'd need what 6 months? That's OBVIOUSLY never going to happen for a normal raider, because that normal raider can consider himself lucky if he even gets BiS normal gear before the next Tier releases. The point of item upgrades is that you can upgrade the few BiS pieces you have, and even then... it's just not much you get.<br />
Some math? <br />
For me as a shadow priest: <br />
upgrading an armor-item nets me around 80-130pp. <br />
That's less int than a friggin GEM (160). <br />
Only thing really worthwhile is upgrading you weapon. (550pp Heroic version, normal probably less than that)<br />
So: no, It's most definitely NOT necessary to upgrade you offspec gear. You'll do just fine with the normal items.<br />
<br />
BTW: I think the upgrade system is intended as a valor dump for raiders that would otherwise just waste this currency. Ofc &quot;joe average&quot; instantly believes that it's 100% mandatory and that he can't raid without it. lol.</div></div><hr />

I'll have to see how the shoulders and helm go on my char but i have﻿ some great morgs if i end up not liking them. But the chest, pants and gloves are amazing and ornate<br />
<br />
pvp- I do very much like this set, though i could go for another chest as i prefer heavy armored looks for my pally. but i like the rest of my set on my female pally.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wayne25uk</div><div class="date">2012-12-29, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOW is on its last meters on so many levels now. The main reason is because the developers have not been doing their job over the last few years to improve many of the core features of the game. That includes outdated content update system that will not stand a chance against F2P games where you dont have to pay monthly subs. <br />
<br />
BLizzard managed to keep Cata in 9 millions by giving the expansion for free towards the end. And they got mop to 10 million but thats the lowest number of any WOW expansion. At the same time players are finding out exactly what the new &quot;content&quot; is in MOP. Its called dailies and you dont have to look for long to see what most ppl think about it. Even big name players that played WOW for years are claiming MOP raids are some of the worst seen in any expansion. It will not hold ppl interested over the next 4-5 months until next tier is out. PPL will be leaving and playing better value games rather than doing dailies. Some might return for 5.2 but I guess most will simply remember the horror of dailies and see that 5.2 has new batch of them to gate their &quot;content&quot;<br />
<br />
And here again we have yet another hater and bullshitter that thinks a few down moments in a games cycle will be its end,if i had the powers that be i would grab a post from every WoW expansion that said &quot;WoW is going downhill coz of this expansion it wont last another year&quot;. My advice is go learn about the games industry first and spend a few years in it then try write your comments again without feeling a complete dick,my family has been in the games industry since i was 6 and i know all the signs all the warnings and all the tricks of the trade,and i for one can promise you all that WoW will still be around for the next 10+ years. So please sir stop with the &quot;I know it all&quot; comments and go learn something about the industry first.</div></div><hr />
