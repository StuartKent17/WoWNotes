Dragon Soul Difficulty Changes<br />
During the scheduled server maintenance on the week of January 31, the Dragon Soul raid will become enveloped by the “Power of the Aspects” spell, reducing the health and damage dealt of all enemies in the raid by 5%. This spell will grow progressively stronger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/109257/power-of-the-aspects/) over time to reduce the difficulty and make the encounters more accessible. The spell will affect both normal and Heroic difficulties, but it will not affect the Looking for Raid difficulty.<br />
<br />
The spell can also be disabled by talking to Lord Afrasastrasz at the beginning of Dragon Soul, if a raid wishes to attempt the encounters without the aid of the Dragon Aspects.<br />
<br />
For those of you who raided in Firelands and/or Icecrown you’re no doubt aware that as time goes on we want to keep people progressing by adjusting the difficulty. For any number of reasons a group may be having difficulty on a specific encounter each week, and our intent in adjusting the content is to ensure the ability to keep progressing, enjoying the content, and gearing up. With Icecrown we progressively buffed the players, and while this slow progression (and ability to opt-out of the buff) were both beneficial, it led to an expectation of your characters power, and once you left the raid you could certainly feel less effective. For Firelands we attempted to fix that by nerfing the content instead of buffing players, but we nerfed the content difficulty all at one time, which was counterproductive for players who really didn’t need as severe a change as we made. With Dragon Soul we’re attempting to do the best of both by having a progressive nerf to the content, keeping player power constant while providing small increases in assistance over a long period of time, as well as allowing players to opt-out of the assistance by speaking to Lord Afrasastrasz.<br />
<br />
We hope you continue to enjoy Dragon Soul, and that these changes encourage you to attempt a higher difficulty, or just keep pushing to down that next boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dragon Soul Difficulty Changes Follow-up<br />
Believe it or not there are actually guilds and raiding groups that are attempting to progress through Normal and Heroic raids, but are hitting a wall, and have been hitting a wall. We have actually statistical date we base our changes on, we know exactly how many people are clearing these raids each week, we know exactly how many people are able to down just a few bosses, and how many were only able to down a few bosses every week for weeks on end and then stopped raiding altogether.<br />
<br />
The issue we're constantly trying to combat is the one where people feel like they're just out of options. One way this is an issue is the content is too easy, they blasted through it, have everything they could possibly want, and have nothing else to do. Ideally that's a small subset of very hardcore players. For everyone else it's a feeling of just being stuck with no possible way to progress. Very few players are willing to suit up, buff up, do all the necessary requirements to raid, jump in, and then do no better than they did last week for hours and hours, only to return next week and do the same.<br />
<br />
If a guild doesn't want the help, they're free to opt out of the buff. For those that do it's an approximate 5% change, which is pretty minor, and we expect it to be about a month before we raise it another 5%. This first change will absolutely help the guilds that are just barely scraping by, or just need a tiny bump to cross the next hurdle, but it's just not logical to exclaim that someone will roll into Raid Finder, grab a couple items, then be looting Heroic Deathwing's corpse the next night.<br />
<br />
We feel the content has been out for quite a while now, that most people who have progressed and downed Deathwing on Heroic have done so, they've had sufficient time to celebrate in their accomplishments, and these very small progressive alterations will only help guilds that are already doing well in the raid get over some hurdles they may be facing.<br />
<br />
If they don't have to be like us, why do they have to have nerfs to get to our position in HM Raiding?<br />
Because they want to and they pay the same amount for the game? I don't know, man. How is it good for the game to have 1% of players parading around for months and months and a 99% sitting around with nothing to do because they're sick and tired of wiping?<br />
<br />
Your solution is &quot;Well then they should get better or quit.&quot; and that's just not reasonable for a video game comprised of millions of people looking to just have some fun. It's still a computer game. <br />
<br />
If there's a easy, normal, and hard difficulty, why tweak normal until it becomes as easy as the easy mode?<br />
Well the nerfs are going to be progressive enough, as I said, I don't see a 5% change being a big enough change for Raid Finder players to suddenly start clearing Normal. We also don't know where we'll end up. We plan to increase the spell by 5% about every month, but we're not sure if we'll need to. If we see a lot of people able to keep progressing and downing bosses, maybe 5% is all we need. It's going to be watching completion numbers and seeing where that gets us. We're not assuming we'll need to go as far as we did with ICC. It's not going to be automatic, our hand is on the dial. <br />
<br />
The increase is not automatic or set in its frequency. We will be manually controlling when it increases, if at all. It will be completely based on how many people we see able to complete the raid, and our decision to increase it or not. <br />

ICC, the buff was mainly cause bosses were slightly overtuned, ESP on Heroic (Sup LK)<br />
Firelands, Nerf came JUST before 4.3 not less than 2 months after<br />
<br />
This is a bullshit nerf, not needed at all &quot;For now&quot;<br />

WAY too soon.</div></div><hr />

This. <br />
<br />
People loved complaining about the ICC buff trivializing ICC heroic content but how many of these complainers were actually in guilds that elected to turn it off? How many of the people decrying the planned progressive debuff for DS will actually have the testicular fortitude to shut it off?</div></div><hr />

No not really and people have already done everything at 0% So It's pointless to turn it off and make it even more a pain.</div></div><hr />

The typical idiot response. It's like saying, &quot;Don't want the free dessert at the restaurant? Say you don't want it&quot;, when in reality who's going to turn down a free dessert? The same thing too, with Dungeon Finder; 'of course' you can make your own groups, but when there's a 15% buff to health/healing/dps, you'd be dumb not to take it. Typical 'you have the option, except if you have a brain, you don't' ethos from Blizzard, let us hope for better from MoP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You wouldn't turn it off is the thing here, There's NO POINT when a lot of guilds have already done it without the buff to show that they can. If they are going to nerf the dam thing do it Firelands / T11 ( Even in normal ) Mechanic nerfs. Not straight up ICC style going back in time.</div></div><hr />

And don't whine no one will. Guilds that genuinely want to do it hardmode will. Or those who want to prove they have balls.<br />

<br />
I don't care because my guild is 7/8 H - I knew this was coming. Did it come early than previous raid tiers? I'm pretty sure T11 wasn't nerfed (aside from Nef) majorly until Firelands.<br />
<br />
T11 and T12+ HM were just Mechanic nerfs and Health nerfs such as Rag and Balaroc.</div></div><hr />

You can spout that it's optional all you want, at the end of the day nobody is going to take the harder route for no gain. Anybody who would actually care about the &quot;prestige&quot; and turn it off already cleared heroic or are close by now.

No. You guys bitched at every instance of where raids were nerfed in some way. In ICC, in Firelands, every damn time they touched a raid there was complaints. Saying it was making everything easier when Blizzard stated yeah that is the point. They saw the backlash on Firelands so they let this be optional. And yet, complaints.

The difference here is that that DS will have a debuff decreasing the damage dealt to you rather than a buff inflating your damage to the bosses. That means you won't have crappy DPS running around thinking they're hot shit flaunting skewed numbers as evidence of their skill. It will allow the more difficult of the heroics to be a bit more forgiving as it will not be so taxing on healing but, if your DPS still hit like wet noodles, you still won't beat enrage timers and you'll still fail regardless.</div></div><hr />

Typical ridiculous, casual response.

<br />
Yeah took Paragon roughly 2 months to kill LK on heroic after the wing was unlocked after going back and looking at the gating dates and their kill date. Took about a month from 4.3 to the first heroic madness kill. So however you look at it, it's way easier. Nerf wasn't needed. I don't care either way, I used to be hardcore but I barely even care anymore, only completed 1/2 of LFR, did BH and was about all I could take for the week, 350vp and out till the reset rofl. So I won't be getting heroic deathwing, nor do I care. Nothing about that place felt epic, at least LK was tough and had an epic feel too it. BC xpac was still tops imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As opposed to the Idiot/Casual/Hardcore split I speculated, it's actually a Guildless/Guilded split.<br />
<br />
LFR is designed for those who are guildless. Normal is designed for the non-elite guilds to start, Heroic for the elite guilds to start. When the elite have cleared heroic, it is nerfed for the non-elite to clear. However, this is bad for the elite guilds, who chew through content so fast they play for a month and run out of stuff to do. But then again, their own fault.</div></div><hr />

Not caring about what others think is idiotic. <br />
<br />
In addition I am also annoyed that I will know we didn't get the boss down before nerf. I dont see 24 other people wanting to turn a nerf off when all it does is disadvantage our progression compared to others.</div></div><hr />

I don't think this is hypocritical either.<br />
<br />
It's like saying if content is too easy for you then you should take some of your gear off to make it harder. Or perhaps if content is too easy then you should play with just 1 hand.... That's just silly. Ofc everyone will take advantage of what they can to be more sucessful wether that's reading guides, buying epic gems or whatever else. It's hard to motivate yourself to work on hard content and wipe on it a lot more than you need to by artificially making things harder for yourself and I doubt many will but i'd still prefer to actually work through the content and earn the rewards rather than have them handed to me....<br />
<br />
All the reasons given for nerfs in past raids are no longer relevant since the addition of LFR. The only reason for this nerf is to give people stuff they haven't earned. This raid tier is already pretty forgiving in comparison to older raids. My casual 3 raids a week guild that only started raiding half way through firelands is 5/8 heroic and we took 3 weeks off even attempting heroics over xmas (even the 1 we'd already killed). It's too early and uneccesary for this nerf wether it's optional or not.<br />
<br />
It's speculated that the 3 raid difficulties are a reason why we get so few raid bosses nowadays but what is the point in wasting dev time on trying to balance these different difficulties if they are just going to nerf everything down into the ground because people aren't good enough to do the higher 1s.... Why not just make raids with the difficulty of LFR and call them &quot;Heroics&quot; so everyone (including those who don't deserve it) can feel like they are earning their progression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
I actually find this change a bit repulsive. The whole point of having multiple difficulties is to give you multiple levels of challenge (and presumably, reward). Sure, you can turn off the buff, but why would you? There aren't any real bragging rights to go after (unless you're just some sort of completionist).<br />
<br />
I really think WoW ought to have some sort of brutally challenging mode with some sort of recognition for the achievement. I'll never go after that sort of thing, but I've enjoyed hard challenges in other games and I think that dedicated players deserve some sort of goal like that. None of this &quot;Well, I killed 3D sarth on January 3 2008 so THERE&quot; nonsense. Maybe MoP with challenge modes will do this sort of thing but.... Blizzard can't just keep nerfing all of their challenges into the ground.</div></div><hr />

so much rage. bottomline, people who wants to flask can choose to flask, and people who choose not to do the fight with flasks can choose not to, same thing with people doing it with brez, and those who wants a challenge and do it without brez, so on and so forth.<br />

and glad you bring up the flask example, that's what it is. additional stuff that people who needs it can use it, and those who don't can choose not to use it.</div></div><hr />

So don't use the buff. You can't choose to use the buff and then complain about using it lol. I mean...come on! <br />
<br />
And are you really so arrogant that you're going to challenge the devs on their data vs your limited viewpoint. Bottom line: what they're doing for raiding is helping the majority of the player base. What you're blabbing about pertains to the small percentage of players who CAN CHOOSE NOT TO USE THE BUFF!</div></div><hr />

Simply because that's what a raider does, he uses EVERY tool the game provides him with in order to make the kill easier, then goes on, executes the fight and tries to get the kill. Telling people to turn off the nerf is like telling them to go do a fight without flasks for example. Why would they make it more difficult when there are no extra rewards / achievements / loot / recognition? It's not about &quot;balls&quot;, it's about common sense. <br />
<br />
But even if you can't understand this simple point, you must have missed the numerous blue posts, explaining what lfr was all about. Lfr was implemented to give casuals a chance to see the content, they said. To help people with no time to raid finish the storyline. Which brings us to the million-dollar question. Since lfr is there, where does the need to nerf normal and heroic mode come from? And their answer is...brickwalls. Really? The normal modes that were cleared on week 1 by everyone were brickwalls? Or heroic bosses 6 of whom were also killed on week 1? We are at 2/8 25hc atm, soon 3/8 and we don't see any brickwall bosses ahead of us. All we see is bosses we need to invest time and progress on in order to kill. Arguably they only possible &quot;brickwall&quot; boss is spine, and it's not, it's only a gear check. <br />
<br />
So it turned out blizzard was full of shit once again. Lfr has been just another loot vendor, a carrot on a stick for people who normally wouldnt raid. And apparently normal and heroic modes are another carrot in a longer stick, they just decided to make it shorter.<br />

Yes, paragon(I think so) did it back in late 3.3. But you have to realize no one had killed H LK when the buff hit. So there was a reason that may have een somewhat justified at the time. And when they did it without the buff, they were already in full heroic gear. Many guilds have killed H Madness without any nerf, on top of the fact that the LFR was supposed to allow &quot;casuals&quot; to see the content, taking away the need for nerfs.</div></div><hr />

Want a tip? If no one in your raid wants to turn off the buff, that's not anyone else's god damn fault. It's yours. And your guild's for sucking. I'm just being honest here.</div></div><hr />

Nobody in their recruitment will say &quot;we're 1/8HC, the 6/8HC you see on armory doesn't count as that's post-nerf!&quot; So when a weaker and less solid guild A goes 6/8HC due to using the buff, and you're 3/8HC due to refusing to use it, who will attract more attention when recruiting? That's right, guild A. And in a world where people are quitting in crowds, be it for SWTOR, be it because 4.3 (and mostly Dragon Soul as a raid instance) is amont the worst things that hit WoW, this means a lot. So for any decent guild with some dignity left, it's a hit in the back. &quot;Content's been out for a while now&quot;. Really? Half of that time was taken by holiday (Christmas) breaks.

Every tier gets nerfed, especially the end tier, so it shouldn't be any surprise that they're doing the same thing with this tier.<br />
<br />
DPS requirement for ICC was a lot higher back then.<br />
Many guilds with HToC gear can only barely hit the enrage timer on normal mode 25-men bosses (Festergut/Professor/Blood queen).<br />
<br />
DS? Guilds faceroll normal mode with dragonwrath and H-FL gear within 2-3 weeks. The progression is way faster than fireland normal and 4.0 normals.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, if they want players to be able to progress more quickly on raid content, they should make the reset twice a week to help people gear up on the stuff they CAN kill, so that killing the latter stuff is easier.<br />
<br />
Glad someone brought that point up. Because I really agree on it. If they want people to &quot;progress faster&quot; they should seriously consider making raid resets more often. But then that would make people to feel pressured. I think an easier way to do it would be to make it so they can down each boss and get loot twice per week. If they want people to progress faster, to down the content easier, the best thing to help with that is to LET THEM get gear and stop gating the hell out of the content. Then norma and heroic mode raiders would have no reason what so ever to complain since their would be absolutely no need for nerfs. So i completely agree with that. But blizzard will never do it, Why? Because they'll never stop gating the content. They've proven that by the fact they wont remove the 25 daily limit when theirs currently over what is it.. 400+ dailies? (read that number some where once it could be way off) they'd use the same excuse they used for it. &quot;we feel our players have no idea what the word moderation means their for we wont give you the option to do it as many times as you want, or just twice, because we dont want you to feel you need to sit there for days on end and kill youself.... cause you dont know how to stop.&quot; -_- lkasjdflkasjdfjka Glad I quit.

<br />
By the time the buff releases, basic reading skills tell us it comes out January 31st, Dragon Soul will have been out for two months. If you or your server cannot do Heroic Madness of Deathwing by then maybe it's time you demote yourself to a casual raider and accept that blizzard wants to hold your hand through the content.</div></div><hr />

It's a change that feels like it's coming out of left field since I could swear Blizzard stated the entire point of LFR was for the bracket of players with less skill/time.<br />
<br />
However, I also think that people need to calm down a little bit. First of all, it's only 5% right now. A guy who can barely clear LFR isn't going to suddenly breeze through H Deathwing because of a 5% difference in health and damage. In fact for most people 5% isn't going to make a real noticeable difference. If you had no trouble with the bosses this wont really change anything. If you were barely scraping by this takes some of the heat off. If you were wiping at the very end this will help you finally down the bosses you had trouble with. If you were wiping consistently early on into the fights this wont help you in the slightest.<br />
<br />
In the very same blue post Blizzard has stated it might not even go beyond 5% and there's currently no upward number they want to shoot for. If 5% winds up being enough they'll leave it at that. If after having it at 5% doesn't make a difference in the numbers they'll increase it some more. Even if the buff does increase more it still doesn't help an LFR baddie all that much. Tanks still need to be skilled, healers still have minimum requirements to maintain, and DPS still need to beat enrage timers. A mechanic that will kill you now will still probably kill you just as handily when the buff is cranked up. Just like with ICC the buff doesn't carry you, it just gives you a nudge in the right direction. Someone who sucks at the game now is still going to suck just as bad after the nerf regardless of how high it gets.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why you're raging so hard. How many more months would you like to wipe in Dragon Soul before someone holds your hand? Would you like to be there for four months or six? Would you like to be wiping on the same bosses until Mists of Pandaria? Would your guild even last that long?<br />

Suck it up princess. If you haven't downed Heroic Madness of Deathwing by now you won't be clearing it with a 5% nerf.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree with this, most of the people who want to raids cry about challenge, about wanting that sense of hard earned reward, so when a buff is offered for those who haven't yet completed this &quot;challenge&quot; Comes along those handful of &quot;special&quot; hardcore raiders come along crying about a nerf. Guess what, you cannot have your cake and eat it too, either do the raid as intended without the buff and get your challenge, or keep your yap shut and accept the fact you cannot do it without this 'tool' to make it easier.</div></div><hr />

It's only easy as that, black and white when you just want to troll.<br />
<br />
No one in their right mind would say a BS like that. A patch stay as long as 6 months (or more) because every group has their pace. After you have had a previous tier on the same level cap, the faster killers will always be the ones who had enough time to deck out their entire raid in heroic gear (and legendaries) from previous tier. In this case, the 1st kills went to groups who had time to finish more than 1 Tarecgosa's, their group is almost fully 391 geared (removing the pieces without 391 upgrade) and even a few heroic rag drops.<br />
<br />
After that, each group will have the need for more or less drops inside the instace to reach the same level and kill the boss. Blizzard is simply denying that.<br />
<br />
Not only that but also clearing the place in PTR helps a lot in clearing it right out of the bat on live. To deny that is just really needing anything to throw BS trolling on others because of self failure.<br />
<br />
4.3 even had christmas and new year's to hold the progression and even that way, a lot of players cleared at least 8/8 normal.<br />
<br />
Bad players will always be that. Bad. Leveling everyone else by that standard is sad and it's what is killing it. Do you really think Blizzard is doing that not because they're loosing subs AGAIN after LFR showing that the same thing they saw at the end of WotLK? The easier it gets, the less ppl will feel like playing too.</div></div><hr />

They also said that LFR would fix the need for hand holding anyways...<br />
<br />
Called BS on all that months ago. &quot;LFR will fix this, so we won't need to keep changing normal/heroic&quot;. Told that they would start changing it as soon as they could after the heroic Madness 1st kill race is over. Took longer for them to make the move because of christmas and new year's (december can't be taken as a full month with ppl on vaction and etc.).<br />
<br />
&quot;LFR will teach players how to raid the current raid without punishing with tons of wipes&quot;, again, BS called on that, never happened and would never work the way LFR is set to work. Players able to ignore the alread few mechanics on the fights would never lead them to step up and learn to deal with these few mechanics that can't be ignored on normal/heroic + the extra mechanics from said modes.<br />
<br />
That leads to one of the best &quot;BS&quot; ever, &quot;we want to see the content blizzard!&quot; famous QQ. Always said, they're not interested in the content, lore, whatever, they just want the damn ilvl that other players are wearing. Doesn't matter if LFR drops exactly the same crap, but a lower ilvl. Those who complained worry about what others can do that they can't, they feel inferior and get pissed at that. The content they talked so much is the damn ilvl. When Blizzard call this BS about doing nerfs to normal/heroic so ppl can see the &quot;content&quot; after implementing LFR I can only laugh since it confirms what I said. Show me what is left to see in normal or heroic DS that we can't see in LFR (other than ilvl and ppl dying to extra mechanics, that is not new content).<br />
<br />
Now to reach the point where a Blue come and say that they've payed, so they are granted to do whatever others are doing without the hassle those had is really sad. I would like to know why every single season I can't get my gladiator title and gladiator mount since I pay the same as those &quot;special snowflakes that reach the magic 0.5whatever% while I'm 0,6%+&quot; that is set by Blizzard. Let's even pretend there is not FotM, MMR exploits, etc. There is no reason I can't get the mount and title a few weeks later too. I pay the same 15$, if higher ilvl of the same crap is new content, no reason for a title, achievement and a special mount not be new content. Why they're removing my right to see that? to have that? See the BS on all that?</div></div><hr />

Because my guess, if everyone can do and get everything its meaningless. If you dont encounter challenges you have to over come.. its not rewarding. Anytime their is any such thing to create any feeling of epicness they nerf it. I think thats the issue. Its epic and you feel accomplished when you down something that is extremely hard to down. If everyone can down it... it no longer feels epic. LFR was brought in so people who couldn't do normals/heroic raids/didn't have a guild to raid with could see the content. Its been out two weeks. Maybe if they actually left something challenging for once, content would last longer. Same concept as using cheats in a single player game. Give the player the ability to have anything they want, the best armor, the best weapons, everything... and they lose interest. Give them a challenge to get it, and they'll work for it. Its not like that for everyone, Im not a hardcore raider, or an elitest or anything of that nature im just speaking from experience. I think LFR was great so everyone could see and do the content. Meaning... if a guild cant do normal or heroic, then they need to get better. Whats the point in having harder difficulties if not to push the player to their limits and beyond. To see just what they're made of. No point having harder difficulties if its not challanging. None what so ever. Them nerfing every content because its challenging... makes people lose interest.</div></div><hr />

This is akin to telling a basketball team that the other team is only going to be allowed to have 4 players on the court (to your 5), but they can opt to let the other side play with an equal number of players - however, if they lose, they will not get paid.<br />
<br />
The only players who would take up that offer would be those who had already made a decent chunk of cash and had a strong sense of competition. Just like with ICC - the only players who really tried it were those who had already geared up and could afford to do it just for the challenge.<br />
<br />
I don't even play WoW anymore and was never an elitist, but if they added LFR, what's the point of nerfing other difficulty levels for content players have already done at their actual ability level?<br />
<br />
Ultimately, this is entirely about hiding their terrible lack of content by encouraging players to see different raid tiers as additional content rather than what they have actually turned into from 4.3 onwards: difficulty settings for otherwise identical content. They figure they can keep putting out rehashed 5-7 boss raids and convince players that they've really released 3 new raids of 15-21 total encounters. It won't work, Blizz. Make the game great again instead of trying silly tactics to milk remaining customers.</div></div><hr />

If you dont encounter challenges you have to over come.. its not rewarding. Anytime their is any such thing to create any feeling of epicness they nerf it. I think thats the issue. Its epic and you feel accomplished when you down something that is extremely hard to down. If everyone can down it... it no longer feels epic. LFR was brought in so people who couldn't do normals/heroic raids/didn't have a guild to raid with could see the content. Its been out two weeks. Maybe if they actually left something challenging for once, content would last longer. Same concept as using cheats in a single player game. Give the player the ability to have anything they want, the best armor, the best weapons, everything... and they lose interest. Them nerfing every content because its challenging... makes people lose interest.<br />
<br />
Except a 5% nerf isn't going to suddenly open the flood gate of clears. This nerf has very little to do with the LFR camp and is chiefly aimed at real raiding guilds that were still struggling and needed a slight push. Like I said in my previous post, people who suck at the game now aren't going to suddenly get better when the changes go live. The guy who can barely cut it in LFR isn't going to even see Heroic Madness, much less down it. People just over-exaggerate a bit with their examples and arguments.<br />

If you REALLY want a challenge for the sake of challenge, turn the debuff off. Problem solved.<br />

<br />
i didn't say it had anything to do with the LFR camp. LFR is for the people who want to raid but cant/dont have time/dont have the skill to do normal/heroics. The people doing normal/heroic are doing it to work for it, not to be handed it. They're not doing it for blizzard to say &quot;oh they're struggling so instead of letting them beat it since other people already have.... we'll help them out with a nerf!&quot; If anyone, ANYONE, in the world, no matter who they are or where they are, can do it without exploiting some classes mechanics or stacking. It can be done by anyone. Not everyone has the skill to do it, I know that. But if they cant do it they cant do it, Raiding isn't hard at all from my experience at it. Its more difficult to find 9 other people who know the fight then it is to actually do it. a nerf is still a nerf no matter how slight. Like my dad always said, &quot;5 dollars 10 times is still 50 dollars&quot;. It will add up in the grand scheme of thing. <br />
<br />
It is purely subjective. LFR is... as i already described to me. Normal I would consider the &quot;doing it for fun&quot; one. Maybe to have a little progression and something to work for. But for heroics.. honestly.. if you're doing those you're doing it for a sense of reward/accomplishment/epicness and bragging rights. You're doing it because you want the challenge and are a hardcore gamer. So you're kinda gonna be doing it for those reasons... Else you wouldn't be attempting it in the first place. Who in their right mind is gonna go do heroic just to wipe 38947598739857987389745 times for no reason? lol. Its not gonna happen. If you dont have a reason for doing something, the mass majority of human beings just wont do it. Sooo they kinda go together.</div></div><hr />

Thank you! This is exactly what Blizzard needs to grasp. The epic feeling and cool factor that this game had, dies when content is watered down for &quot;everyone to see&quot;. No one wants to see it all! <br />
<br />
Perfect example... You meet a new girl. You are completely engrossed with her... all you can think about is this girl. What Blizzard is doing is essentially equivalent to this girl just walking up to you naked and saying, &quot;You never would have seen this without me just giving it to you... Because lets face it, you kind of suck. So here it is! Was that fun? We should keep hanging out for 5 years, I will do as little as possible to keep you interested in me and you will give me $15 a month, OK?&quot; The mystery is gone, the interest is gone, the excitement is gone. You have seen it all!<br />
<br />
I don't get how a billion dollar corporation doesn't have one person working for them who could point out this basic human psychology. Instead... we continue to have lazy, rehashed fights and a quickly dying player base that has &quot;seen everything there is&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Maybe because it completely trivializes the work people put into defeating the normal/HM bosses? Also, before you use the &quot;special snowflake&quot; argument on me, take a moment and think about who's really the special snowflakes: those who don't want their efforts trivialized or those who want everything changed and given to them &quot;just cause&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Not really. As others have already mentioned, if you're really a true elite raider then you have already downed heroic deathwing and this OPTIONAL nerf does not affect you or concern you. If you haven't done so, then maybe it's time you accepted you're not as elite as you thought you were. You're in the 99% the blue post talks about not the 1%.</div></div><hr />

Hardcore Guilds cleared DS HC weeks ago. Regular guilds cleared DS Normal weeks ago.. they had their challenge. It won't change anything for them if<br />
others have 5% or more buff in DS. THEY already cleared it.<br />
<br />
Why should someone that pays the same amount of money for something not be getting the same as others?<br />
<br />
Would you like to buy a Ferrari and not getting a steering wheel, no brakes, no radio and no seats in it, but you payed same as one that has it all? NO you would not like that.<br />
<br />
It doesn't diminish or trivialises what other guilds have done. They did it while the nerf wasn't active. They can still turn turn the buff off and do it old school. <br />
We live in 2012 and everybody wants diversity and freedom on the planet, yet you ask for elitism and kind of a &quot;monopolysm&quot; in a videogame.. <br />
<br />
People will remember who killed DS HC first; they will remembe when and under which circumstances. 5% buff doesn't matter when it comes to world first 10 DS HC kills.<br />
<br />
All you crap QQ'ers should stop complain, play the game and if it's not fun; quit for gods sake. How can you be bored of something and still keep on doing it.. that's just hypocriticy at it's best. BLIZZARD doesn't owe you anything. They will do what they want with their game, accept it or leave.</div></div><hr />

The pro cyclists still rides their bikes even though the car is invented. Runners still run even though the cycle is invented.why are they doing it?<br />
Because they can still compete on on the same level.<br />
<br />
IRL what is the bigger accomplishment walking 50 km. or driving 50 km.?<br />
<br />
Just as raiders can still compete on the same level. <br />
If you turn the buff off, you choose to walk knowing that you could have driven in a car.Won't you feel a bigger accomplishment?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wasn't the whole idea behind it, to allow more casual players to experience the content?<br />
Wasn't half the reason they implemented it, so that heroic and normal difficulty would be left alone?<br />
<br />
The only reason i can see for nerfing DS, both normal and heroic, is to drag out the content as long as possible.<br />
<br />
Burning Crusade: 50 bosses over 2 years.<br />
Wrath: 50 bosses over 2 years. (not including pvp raids)<br />
Cata: 28 bosses over 13 months. (not including pvp raids)<br />
<br />
Their excuse for the low amount of content was 'faster, more frequent expansions'. By this logic, FL and DS should have been rolled into a single tier, and we should be hitting 5.0 by now, with MoP just around the corner (1-2 months tops).<br />
<br />
With the slow nerfing of DS, on both difficulties, I cant see MoP coming out before Q3, probably Q4. <br />
<br />
I doubt there will even be a Ruby Sanctum or Sunwell type filler raid.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can turn it off. No, the competition will not turn it off.</div></div><hr />

If this is how MoP will turn out, I think I am just gonna be done with the game, I had new hopes in DS that they would finally leave content untouched and unerfed so we all got to experience it in the same way, I guess they never really planned on it.

A 5% nerf is not going to make people magically master the mechanics of a fight. Our guild is currently working on Hagara HC, and well a 5% nerf is not going to make people move perfectly in a frost phase.<br />
5% nerf will most likely still force us to do 2 rounds to the crystals. <br />
A 5% nerf is not going to make us position perfectly to take for the lightning phase to allow us to survive, the nerf will give you 2 seconds at most extra to stay alive. 2 seconds is most likely an exaggeration. <br />
What a 5% will do is, if we have mastered the fight, and need to squeeze out that extra little dps to avoid the enrage, is make us have to squeeze out a little less extra. Which does not change the fact that we can handle all the intended mechanics. So at most the wipe would save us what? 5-10 wipes. <br />
<br />
We got Yorsahj last week, we killed him as we reached the enrage, the last 60 seconds of that fight is a tank and spank. 5% won't change anything. You still need to take care of the oozes properly <br />
<br />
In a months time if you haven't downed the bosses yet, then maybe you do need the 10% nerf. If you really feel like the 10% or hell even the 5% takes the challenge you desire out of it. Switch it off, and have a blast and enjoy your challenge. <br />
<br />
Since when has personal achievement become less important than some random number on a website? Nobody is going to give a shit about whether you downed a boss at this stage. However beating the content without the nerf, lets you know that you beat the raid at its hardest and the self satisfaction from that should be more important than anything else. If that's not the case however, you should seriously look at your priorities again</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly learn when the ENTER key is located on your keyboard.<br />
Second since you are on 8/8 normal you are bad enough to consider the buff as a bless for you, even the monkeys that you stating on your last line have killed Morchok heroic since ages.<br />
Stop whining.<br />
<br />
If you care about server first then you use it as everyone else who care about the same thing, so technically there is no advantage for anyone those who were closer to kill X boss they will kill it faster than the other either way.</div></div><hr />

Now tell me, guilds at 8/8 hc are still playing the game? I don't think so, they are probably playing another game or doing other stuff and logging wow only 1 day per week to clear those 8 bosses in 2-3 hours or so. This game has changed in these few years, in Vanilla we used to have elitist players with legendary items and in full t2/3, they were rare in every realm and the efford was a &quot;real&quot; reward, now especially after the release of wotlk the game came to favour of casual players, this has been a good move from blizzard to increase their relashionship with the majority of wow community, everyone pay the same amount for this game, so i don't find anything wrong with these game mechanic changes at all.</div></div><hr />

I do always find the accessibility arguement puzzling when the difficulty of content was rarely tweaked through vanilla, TBC and even most of WOTLK.

LFR was introduced as a means for MORE people to see content. This change is about MORE people progressing through the difficultly levels.If you can't handle that, that someone else might do something you have already done, then either you need some professional help or should take a step back from online gaming.It wouldn't matter if this wasn't optional, it simply gradually knocks a few bricks out of the wall that MOST guilds have hit and means they can have fun, instead of wiping week after week on the same boss (Bash actually said that, right there, in blue text).There are other people in this game than you.

You probably hit the nail on the head. Apparently &quot;turn it off, it's optional&quot; is a valid response, but nobody in their right mind would turn it off. Nerfing the content (which, remember, will escalate as time goes on) trivializes the time and effort put in by those who did it originally. Any argument I've seen used can be turned right back around on them:<br />
<br />
- &quot;I pay $15 just like you.&quot; - I didn't realize my $15 a month automatically got me in a good, dedicated group. You can find one too.<br />
- &quot;It's optional.&quot; - So is doing the raid in the first place.<br />
- &quot;Special snowflake.&quot; - So I guess you guys aren't &quot;special snowflakes&quot; when you demand equal reward for unequal effort? If we shouldn't get worked up because &quot;it's just purple text and pixels&quot;, why do you guys do everything you can to get them?<br />
<br />
Why can't anything in this game be special anymore? Why are we the selfish assholes when so many of you completely disregard what we want?</div></div><hr />

I'm at 8/8 Heroic and I care. This happened in ICC, this happened in FL, this will happen in DS too. Guess what? I'm playing a healer. Do I need to explain you what happens, when nerfs like these occur? Here's the answer: healers warm the bench or are forced to play offspec, if they want a chance to raid. That's what happens.<br />
<br />
Out of my 24 Alysrazor kills I healed maybe 7 or 8 and most of that was back in July/August. Out of my 21 Shannox kills, I healed on ~6. 19 Rag kills. I healed 7 of them tops. <br />

<br />
Yeah it completely trivialises the effort you went through because you already have the ranking that you aimed for. No matter how much they nerf the content, you have 2 things already <br />
1) Time stamp to your achievement. Yeah you can say everybody will have that achievement. However people who know their shit, and the people competing at your level (which are the people you'd want to epeen to anyway) will know the worth of the early achievement<br />
2) Your ranking on wow progress. You got to 8/8 HC before before the dirty plebs, the nerf isn't magically going to push them to higher than even if they get 8/8 HC.<br />

Typical 'you have the option, except if you have a brain, you don't' ethos from Blizzard, let us hope for better from MoP.<br />
<br />
you can easily turn this around : <br />
&quot;waaah they serve dessert at this restaurant. Now I have to eat something there I don't like, or not go to that restaurant at all!!!&quot;<br />
While you don't have to eat the dessert if you don't want to because yes.... wait for it........... IT IS OPTIONAL!!!<br />

A: “Waaaaaaaaaaaah, FL is too easy”<br />
B: “oh you downed Ragnaros on heroic already then in the first few weeks?”<br />
A: “erm, no…”<br />
<br />
People overlook all the possibilities they have that they can use to spice up the encounters. <br />
All of those possibilities are optional if you seek for the challenge.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: People complain simply because they want to complain.</div></div><hr />

Sure its optional, but it comes down to 10/25 people decideing if they want to keep it up. Also for anyone whos not already cleared HC and still like to keep it semi-competative are forced to have it on, simply cos the rest are likely to have it on:)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilian</div><div class="date">2012-01-19, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since when does everyone who is stuck at a boss wants nerfs? Everytime I killed something because it got nerfed I didn't enjoy it at all. You have been working on a boss for two weeks or so and then they nerf it... So all wasted time or what?<br />
And hardmode is there to challenge players. So why nerf it? If you get stuck or don't want to do hardmodes because it's too hard then you can do normal.<br />
<br />
People here underestimate the power of a 5% less damage taken nerf. It probably means you can go with one less healer and now all of a sudden you can kill everything. Or if you had problems with healing then they are now over. It probably also stacks with certain class mechanics/talents.<br />
<br />
The people at Blizzard only look at statistics of how many people cleared this or that. They probably never progressed themselves through TBC raids or hardmodes. It really sucks balls when you put time and effort into killing a hard boss (for you) and then it gets nerfed and it becomes easy for your guild. It's all fine for people who are not progressing on that content or people who already killed everything or people who are only out for gear. It's not about seeing the content because everyone has already seen the content. Hardmodes are only there for challenge and nothing else. Now they are nerfing it for loot hungry players. When you get stuck somewhere the goal is to get better as a group, that's the challenge...</div></div><hr />

<br />
No because you are the only one who decides if it's turned on or off. Not the other 29 people in your guild. If the majority wants it on it's on and you got nothing to say. Optional my ass.</div></div><hr />

You have the option of quitting the guild and finding another one.</div></div><hr />
