<br />
Hodir<br />
HP - 25M (Heroic Mode)<br />
Normal melee attacks for 25k damage on a well-geared warrior<br />
His aura called Biting Cold is using the same mechanics as Intense Cold during the fight against Keristrasza, it stacks up and damage increase over time. Moving will reset the stack. (This is also affected by the Toasty Fire, see below)<br />
Hodir casts &quot;Flash Freeze&quot; (9 seconds cast time), a spell that freezes the entire raid in blocks of ice. <br />
He will randomly spawn Icicles, they will create patch of ices on the ground as they drop. Standing on the ice when Hodir casts Flash Freeze prevents from being encased in a block of ice.<br />
You can also prevent Biting Cold and Freeze by staying next to a Toasty Fire in the room, however it will be removed by Flash Freeze. Warms nearby friendly creatures, preventing the effects of Freeze and Biting Cold, and increasing Spirit by 4. Toasty fire can be extinguished by falling ice or powerful frost magic.<br />
After Flash Freeze, Hodir will gain &quot;Frozen Blows&quot; and deal 70% reduced physical damage but each attack deals 40,000 additional frost damage. <br />
<br />
At the beginning of the fight, 8 (4 in 10-Man) adds are trapped in blocks of ice next to Hodir. You can break the blocks of ice during the fight to free them and get their help, there are 3 kind of adds:<br />
Moonkins - Cast Starlight (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62807), players standing in the column of light get their haste increased by 50%<br />
Shamans - Cast Storm Power (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63711), Increases critical strike chance of up to 3 friendly targets in a chain by 100% for 15 sec.<br />
Mages - Cast Toasty Fire (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62821) - Warms nearby friendly creatures, preventing the effects of Freeze and Biting Cold, and increasing Spirit by 4. Toasty fire can be extinguished by falling ice or powerful frost magic. <br />
Priests - Dispell the Frost Nova. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thorim PTR Testing (Europe)<br />
Thorim is being tested on EU PTRs once again tonight! <br />
<br />
Health Points - 16.7M (25-Man) / ? (10-Man)<br />
<br />
The fight takes place in The Clash of Thunder, an arena overwatched by Thorim himself. As you enter the arena you will see a Jormungar Behemoth (~1.2M HP) fighting a captured alliance/horde (opposing faction) team composed of 1 tank, 1 healer, and 3 damage dealers. Killing them is fairly easy, just make sure you take care of the AoE healing from the healer while fighting the NPC and try to avoid the large poison breath while fighting the Jormungar. <br />
<br />
Once the NPCs and the Jormungar are dead, a lot of constructs (melee, casters, and healers) will jump into the arena from the stands and you will have to handle them with only one part of your raid while Thorim throws Stormhammers at them. He will also randomly activates the lightning orbs surrouding the arena, they will deal strong AoE damage to anyone near as soon as they are activated: run away from them! <br />
<br />
The 2nd part of the raid will have to go through the hallway to the left of the Arena and fight its way to Thorim. This hallways is also full of constructs and will also have you deal with two mini bosses (about 5M HP each), you only have 5 minutes to reach Thorim before he goes berserk and kills your raid.<br />
<br />
When Thorim is pulled by the hallway team, he will jump into the arena and the last part of the fight will begin. He's got 11M Health Points and hits a well geared tank for 8k damage but will also use two abilities: the first one is an Unbalancing Strike (http://thottbot.com/test/s62130) reducing the defense of the tank by 200 for 15 sec (100 for 6 seconds in normal). He will also casts Lightning Charge (http://thottbot.com/test/s62279) every 15 seconds, just like with Grull this effect will stack and Thorim will deal more and more damage during the fight. (Thanks to Wraith (http://wraith-guild.net/) for the help on the description of the fight)<br />

It's possible that it's just the AOE damage from the orbs, instant death for standing too close to them</div></div><hr />

No, it was shown in combat log as Chain Lightning (in the stream)</div></div><hr />

And yeah he is like Gruul, he will hit harder as time passes..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Or they're changing the model of him for the Storm Peaks quests. You know, so he and Loken actually look like they're related?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I wasn't in there, but from watching the stream it appears to do more damage if it chains to other players. Possibly fatal damage if it bounces as much as a single time. The ranged DPS and healers looked spread out and the chain lightning attack would not be fatal if it hit a single person.<br />
<br />
The melee was called to run back when the chain lightning was cast because it would gib the tanks if it bounced to them (and the hit box was too small to just spread out).<br />
<br />
This is just my speculation, however. I wasn't in the raid it just seemed like that was what was going on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
His model is being changed, because Loken says &quot;I will restore him to his proper former glory&quot; or something to that effect. This is how he looked in ye olden times, before he got old and squalid, then turned blue from sitting on top of a mountain waiting for us to get cold weather flying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He seems to frozen blow before flash freeze too, so its less predictable and seems to force a tank in FR for the full fight instead of an offtank.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Got 2 attempts in before it was down, pretty easy boss it seems.... with only 4 healers and 22 people we got him down to like 50 or 60%.</div></div><hr />

Maybe now is viable the 3min (or was 4?) achievement. I don't think it was really viable before.</div></div><hr />

20? ppl on the pull hit the 9min enrage timer at 15%<br />
7 healers, can probally have one of our tank healers dual spec to dps for this one<br />
solo tank, druid in FR gear<br />
<br />
looks like the &quot;hardmode&quot; is a 3 min kill, thats when one of the 2 loot chests despawned</div></div><hr />

He was only up long enough for like 1-2 attempts, I'm not sure if it was posted or not but Hodir drops 8.5 chests</div></div><hr />
