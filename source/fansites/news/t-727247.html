<br />
During a bloody civil war among the three dwarven factions of Ironforge, the Bronzebeards ousted the Wildhammer and the Dark Iron clans from the ancient corridors of the mountain city. In the wake of the defeat, the Wildhammers ventured north and forged a new home, Grim Batol, in the mountains of what is now the Twilight Highlands. However, although they worked tirelessly to create a better future for themselves, the Dark Irons, who established the city of Thaurissan in the Redridge Mountains, could not move beyond the memory of their defeat. Consumed by the desire for revenge and desperate to control the entire dwarven region of Khaz Modan, the Dark Irons led a two-pronged assault on the Bronzebeards in Ironforge and the Wildhammers in Grim Batol. Despite their past differences, these two embattled rivals joined forces and drove the Dark Irons out of Khaz Modan, decimating the armies of the treacherous clan's sorcerer-thane, Thaurissan. Yet victory carried grave consequences. Although Thaurissan's wife and queen, Modgud, was slain during the attack on Grim Batol, her death tainted the mountain fortress. While the Bronzebeards rebuilt their glorious city of Ironforge, the Wildhammers felt forever changed by the horrors they witnessed at Grim Batol. They fled their cursed home and never returned.<br />
<br />
The abandoned city's defiled corridors later became home to a number of nefarious plots. When the Demon Soul was discovered by the Dragonmaw clan and used to force Alexstrasza's drakes to serve the Horde, Grim Batol acted as the red Dragon Aspect's torturous prison. The Dragonmaw held Grim Batol through the Second War, before they were driven out by Deathwing, who planned to steal Alexstrasza's eggs. Yet as Deathwing carried out his plan, the Demon Soul was destroyed, and the powers locked within were returned to Alexstrasza, Ysera, Nozdormu, and Malygos. Deathwing narrowly escaped an assault by the four re-empowered Dragon Aspects, although he did not leave empty-handed; in his grasp were the eggs of Alexstrasza. For their vile transgressions, the fleeing Dragonmaw were shown no mercy, and the struggle came to a quick end. Members of the red dragonflight were left behind to keep watch over Grim Batol, and for years they successfully guarded its desolate halls from further intrusion... until the arrival of the Twilight's Hammer, a sinister cult who worshipped Azeroth's malefic Old Gods.<br />
<br />
The cult, seduced by Deathwing's thirst for absolute domination over Azeroth, has claimed the Twilight Highlands as its base of operations. The black dragonflight has driven off the agents of the red dragonflight who guarded Grim Batol so that it may be used as a fortress for training Deathwing's minions. The halls of Grim Batol run so deep into the highlands that it is unknown to what twisted end the Twilight's Hammer is using this doomed dwarven marvel.<br />
<br />
Called to action by the red dragonflight in the Twilight Highlands, players will be charged with putting a decisive end to the foul machinations developing within the level-85, 5-player dungeon of Grim Batol. The ferocity of the enemies within should not be underestimated, and with the assistance of brave Red Drakes and a handful of explosives, players can thin the ranks of Grim Batol's occupiers through bombing flights into the ruined city's corridors. Regardless of how successful these attacks might be, General Umbris will not allow his army to fall so quickly. In the end, adventurers will be left to their own devices, venturing into the darkest recesses of the dwarven fortress, where a nightmarish enemy is taking shape. Will you be able to uncover Grim Batol's secrets and emerge unscathed, or will your destiny be sealed within this tortured city, like so many brave heroes before you?<br />

You know no details other then &quot;you get to bomb from a dragon's back&quot;. That could be another occ, or just a spam button-1. From reading a bit futher, it clearly tells you that you are left on your own when things get serious, so i seriously do not expect any bossfight on drakes.<br />
<br />
Please, give them the benefit of the doubt, be awed by the beauty of the place, and shut the negative feedback untill you actually played the dungeon, would you?<br />

Placeholder models. They'll be updated or changed when Blizzard get around to it.<br />

And I think it sounds awesome, great place to start the war against Deathwing. Basically its similar to Naxx in that you're attacking a 'training ground' for his minions and taking out some of his Lieutenants.</div></div><hr />

I see humans everyday and everywhere. What's with the recycled humans content in RL?<br />
<br />
Seriously, we are fight OLD enemies, not new enemies. Unless they have good plastic surgeons, we should be expecting to fight against the same old models.<br />

Guess they even bring placeholder models to ptrs.<br />

I don't know whether those models are placeholders or not, but given the information we got (oh secret sexy boss beneath cho'gall (ol god eek eek)) a vezax model isnt that far away.<br />

we're dealing with the twilights hammer cult who have been in the game since vanilla. They're definitely been given an update but i don't see wth you expect, this completely ignoring the fact that its still in alpha. Newsflash: these aren't new enemies we're fighting...<br />

I know deathwing and the gronn have a history but im still not sure why the black dragonflight would bring dragon killers with them. I don't think they'll be able to train them to just fight red drakes if that was the cause...should be interesting.</div></div><hr />

They've been recycling for a while. Imo, I think redoing Azeroth was a mistake. The more I see, the less excited I am. I really enjoyed TBC because it was something new. <br />

Of course, that's partially do to the addition of only 5 levels too. I don't know, but it appears that there are a lot of corners being cut for CAT. Having said that, WoW really has no competition in the MMO genre, so what do they care?</div></div><hr />

I know one of the interviews out there mentioned that after you defeated Cho'gal on heroic mode, the floor dropped out and you learned a 'terrible truth'. They mentioned lava, black dragon eggs aaaaannnnddd...<br />
<br />
Well, looks like the Old Gods themselves are corrupting the dragon eggs. Could this be a new dragon-flight in the works, or perhaps we are seeing the beginnings of the Infinite Dragons?</div></div><hr />

The forces of the Twilight's Hammer within Grim Batol are massive, so you'll start the dungeon with a bombing run through the halls to thin their ranks. It'll be a set flight path and will not involve aerial combat. This is only to get things started. This dungeon is not vehicle-driven at all.<br />
<br />
That's alright then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On topic: it loooks awwweeeesome.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I don't mind the cultists (any race), dragons etc. nor the dungeon itself (and I personally agree with you that it looks pretty good, even though the &quot;Blackrock style&quot; of dungeons doesn't really appeal to me). Those are both expected and justified. It just annoys me that they don't expand the story of and explain the connections between Deathwing, Twilight's Hammer and the Old Gods and specifically their doings in Grim Batol, mainly the how of it. At the moment it's frustratingly vague and the &quot;obvious connection&quot; between many things is pretty far stretched. Why are the Gronn there, for example? Did some Twilight Hammer cultist bring a few back to Grim Batol on R&amp;R from Outland? Why Gronn? Why is a faceless general (or whatever you want to call the type of faceless that Vezax and this new guy are) in Grim Batol, even assuming they're sent out to lord TCs around? Presuming they are, why are the reds (especially if some of them are the reds that were driven out or otherwise hung around that part of the world to keep involve in those affairs) allowing horde to use them if the horde is now allied with Dragonmaw? Sure, some of these (such as the Dragonmaw story and what the current relationship between Deathwing and the Old Gods is (pawn? allied? nutcase prodded in a certain direction?), certainly) will probably be explained in due time but still, much could have been explained without having to spoil.<br />
<br />
Also, you do not reskin things to use as placeholders. Also, wut at people going &quot;don't say anything negative until you've played it!&quot;, it's called voicing concern because we want it to be as good as you presumably do. Also, what's wrong with the comment that much of TBC looked new? It did. So did WotLK apart from the giant playing for time that recycling Naxxramas was. Expansions are supposed to look and feel new, while they've seem to have done a great job on remaking Azeroth so far they need to follow it up all the way, sycophantic mewling won't iron out the creases in the details. Also, no one has said the re-used models are bad (hell, Gronn are one of my favourite creature models as well), it's simply the principle of using them when you neither sufficient explain their presence and/or don't balance the weight with new (as in new new, not new content that looks like old content) content on the other side of the scales. Also, overall alpha is actually pretty late in the development cycle.<br />
<br />
I don't see any corners being cut, just high speed rubber marks tarnishing the details. It's not the world but it's not hard to fix either so it should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And i agree with the recycling of mobs but so long as theres &quot;New&quot; encounters that are fun and exciting i don't really care what it is i'm killing<br />
<br />
As for people saying &quot;it's only 5 levels&quot; That's just pretty noob, The amount of xp required say for level's 70 to 72 will be the same time as 80 to 81 I don't mean in terms of experience, obviously it will be raised, but i dare say that it will take you just as long to level from 80 to 85 as what it did from level 60 to 70 and 70 to 80 (back in the day b4 outland nerfs etc etc of course)<br />
<br />
Also on another note, i hope they do the whole drake thing better, I think it would be cooler if it was like a bombing run (which is the general thought i got after reading) and not some fly around and get raped by drakes ala occulus style, i love bombing runs but i hate occulus its just too crap in pugs and no 3gold blue gems will change that...</div></div><hr />

At the moment it's frustratingly vague and the &quot;obvious connection&quot; between many things is pretty far stretched...<br />
Deathwing, as per the novels, seperate from the twilight, he is a nutcase being prodded from behind by the old gods. The Twilight cultists are a group who actually worship the old gods actively. And Grim Batol has changed hands a lot, most recently the red dragonflight had been gaurding it keep outsiders from trying to enter it for unknown reasons. Later it was found out deathwing was being contained far far within it. The connections so far are only independent stories whith few common denominators (Either deathwing or old gos, with those two connecting) It is not a huge stretch at all to reasonably predict the cata story line to bring these together and expand the story as a whole. So imho, it is not &quot;frustratingly vague&quot; at all. or at least no more so than any movie or story in which a preview is given but the actualy story is not out yet. Mind you I have read all the preceading material involving each of the separate stories.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are the Gronn there, for example? Did some Twilight Hammer cultist bring a few back to Grim Batol on R&amp;R from Outland? Why Gronn? Why is a faceless general (or whatever you want to call the type of faceless that Vezax and this new guy are) in Grim Batol, even assuming they're sent out to lord TCs around?As far as we know so far, it is only one lesser gronn. The Gronn are native to outland yes, but beings from both worlds have been going to and from for a while now. We know the Gronn have taken a liking to dragon hunting ever since the black dragon flight went to outland. It is also suggested that they are decendent from a demi god, or something clsoe to one. Either this gronn came here on its own looking to hunt dragons, or the twilight cult went out and captured him for a sacrfice to either the old gods or deathwing himself. As the blacks HATE the gron.<br />
<br />
<br />
why are the reds (especially if some of them are the reds that were driven out or otherwise hung around that part of the world to keep involve in those affairs) allowing horde to use them if the horde is now allied with Dragonmaw? Sure, some of these (such as the Dragonmaw story and what the current relationship between Deathwing and the Old Gods is (pawn? allied? nutcase prodded in a certain direction?), certainly) will probably be explained in due time but still, much could have been explained without having to spoil.<br />
The orcs as a whole species has a checkered past. The dragonmaw are not exclusive to this. Now we have no idea the relationship surrounding the new alliance with them, however the reds, like all dragons, view themselves above the rest of us anyways. And especially on matters of higher concern can and will utilize anything and anyone to meet their own ends. Luckily in the case of the red, this higher end usually coincides with our own interests and a preventing the destruction of life as we know it scale. They are the guardians of life as it were. So we are not using them as much as they are using us.<br />
<br />
<br />
what's wrong with the comment that much of TBC looked new? It did. So did WotLK apart from the giant playing for time that recycling Naxxramas was. Expansions are supposed to look and feel new, while they've seem to have done a great job on remaking Azeroth so far they need to follow it up all the way, sycophantic mewling won't iron out the creases in the details. Also, no one has said the re-used models are bad<br />
The idea is that in TBC, we went to a new world, so of course way more will be new-new, not old-new. This goes for Wrath as well in the sense that its a completely different climate. For grim batol, the enemies have been seen before, so of course it will be old-new. Now mind you this is just one dungeon. Others, like Uldum as just one example, expect to see more new-new, as its a sealed micro-habitat we have never entered before.<br />
<br />
The biggest issue I see people complain about when looking at the new content is they want to see it all packaged in one chunk and clearly labled &quot;New&quot;. There are enough new zones to call it a continent, they just happen to be spread out and interlaced with old zones. There will be plenty of new-new creatures and such, but they are also going to be mixed much more with old-new creatures. Also we are only seeing bits at a time of things, placeholder or not, the whole picture is not there yet. You have the right to be concerned of course but I hope you take this concern and use it to look more closely and see everything, not just what you want to see. Without context, meaning becomes blurred.</div></div><hr />

Good question :/ so far i can see only recycled models for the instance im waiting the most since the time i heard there is going to be Grim Batol instance :/<br />
But atm i can see great place design (big and dwarf like...duh) but already there are 2 things i dont like... recycling old models. Humans and dragons are fine since its hard to modify them alot, so is gronn, but instead throwing new vezax they could at least create new creature with some awesome looks.

But atm i can see great place design (big and dwarf like...duh) but already there are 2 things i dont like... recycling old models. Humans and dragons are fine since its hard to modify them alot, so is gronn, but instead throwing new vezax they could at least create new creature with some awesome looks.

As many have stated beffor me, the hard drive space would be crazy huge if they kept adding new models. Also, lots of these could very well be place holders untill the digital artists get done with the new modles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the US-Forums:<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, it's not vehicle combat at the beginning of the dungeon. The forces of the Twilight's Hammer within Grim Batol are massive, so you'll start the dungeon with a bombing run through the halls to thin their ranks. It'll be a set flight path and will not involve aerial combat. This is only to get things started. This dungeon is not vehicle-driven at all.</div></div><hr />

There is also the issue of this band of adventurers who kind of killed the blue aspect, the bronze aspect being like, missing, and the green one having a nap.<br />

Stop whining people, i like some comebacks - of Grull model for example. Those monsters were never used to full potential even in Nagrand. Have you seen &quot;How to tame a dragon&quot; movie(film)? Totally recalls me that main hero listing in the book &quot;extreamely dangerous, kill on sight, extreamely dangerous, kill on sight, choke his victims, poisons his victims, ...&quot; and there are many new &quot;models&quot; of dragons. Yet every one is extreamely dangerous and you should kill him on sight. In other words, no mather what he (Vezax-like creature) looks like, he is extreamely dangerous. Kill on sight!</div></div><hr />

Its not dumb at all ~_~ the game is allready at what? 16G? now to thos that have a T or more of space thats not a very big number, But Blizzard likes to make sure people can run this game with sub par systems, That includes slow small hard drives.<br />

Good for you that you like vehicle fights, but afaik Blizzard stated themselves that they kinda over did it with vehicles in WotLK. So I hope they will be more careful when to implement them in Cata.<br />

<br />
The same reason none of the uber-powerful boss characters in WotLK and BC didn't go into any given dungeons and kill those bosses. You honestly think Arthas could kill Alexstrasza? She could kill Tirion with one breath yet she didn't because if she did either THERE GOES THE CONTENT. If every raid culminated in a good boss coming in and saying &quot;stand aside, I'll kill this ass hat&quot; no one would play WoW. That's why the dragon aspects won't kill deathwing. On top of that he is backed by the Old Gods. What makes you think it's just Deathwing we are fighting? If the Faceless Ones are getting involved then there is a very good chance that the Old Gods are augementing Deathwing's power to levels far beyond that of another individual Dragon Aspect. Nozdormu has his hands a little tied, Malygos...well, you know, Ysara seems to be a little lost at the moment as well. So honestly it's just Alexstrazsa v. Deathwing and with the agents he has on his side I truly doubt just she and Korialstrasz could kill him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well first they were RE-empowered with their powers.. not empowered with more powers on top of the powers they had before. second Malygos is dead, Ysera is still sleeping as far as we know, and Nozdormu is busy traveling through time making his infinite dragonflight. so that leaves just Alexstrasza to confront Deathwing. even though she might be the queen of all dragons it took her and the three other aspects to chase Neltharion off at the battle of grim batol.<br />

It doesn't need 100% new art/models/skins, but damn, I don't see one single creature in those screenshots that isn't ALREADY in the game, and many have been since vanilla.<br />
<br />
so your saying we need to see humans that don't look like humans, and dragon's that don't look like dragons because those creatures are already in the game.. so what we need is a black dragon, and human stronghold that does not contain any black dragon's or humans?<br />

Anyways, this instance looks cool, probably some reason why the gronn n ulduar boss model is there, hopefully they aren't bosses, want to see something original, but a mutation is fine too.<br />
<br />
<br />
they turned one of the most interesting and lore filled areas of the game, one that has been the focus of 2 different books, one that was the birthplace of the Twilight dragonflight, into a 5 player dungeon....<br />
way to take the epic out of the game there blizz<br />
<br />
That's nothing compared to turning elemental lords like Al'Aqir n Neptulon to 5 man bosses... but yet Ragnaros was a raid boss n will be so again.</div></div><hr />

Guess what, these are ex-Ironforge dw0rfes, if u had bothered to read the lore that Boub posted, u would have known that!<br />
<br />
Ofc it should have similarities, I like the dark twisted ironforge/brd style.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realise its exactly the same ''Cult'' that we found in the depths of Ulduar that invaded Grim'Batol, so how it doesn't makes sense they look similar ?<br />
<br />
People will always cry about anything anyway, please do us and yourselve a favor, just don't buy cataclysm. Go whine about something else.</div></div><hr />

He was powerful with the dragon soul but since it was destroyed and the power returned to the other aspects what will stop, Alextrasz,Kalegos etc from kicking his ass.<br />
<br />
Well we did KILL one of them already. It took all four just to send him fleeing, I doubt three could kill him outright. Oh and Kalecgos is not Malygos, period.</div></div><hr />

The fact is they have. I'm pretty sure I gave an example before:<br />
<br />
Death Knight introduction and trailer, where the DK was wearing a recolored version of Demon Stalker - the Hunter set from Karazhan.<br />
<br />
That was the OFFICIAL trailer. Guess what. It was placeholder; it never appeared in-game.<br />
<br />
P.S.<br />
They're using a fire Marrowgar, accompanying a returned Ragnaros at Hyjal (which we &quot;already visited&quot; in Caverns of Time). Complain about that.</div></div><hr />

Grim Batol Raid<br />
The Grim Batol raid instance will be called the Bastion of Twilight, and you get to fight Cho'gall as the end boss! If you manage to defeat him in Heroic Mode, an &quot;horrific secret will be revealed when he dies&quot;.<br />
<br />
Information gathered from other sites:<br />
<br />
* This is an entry-level raid, just like Naxxramas in WotLK. (Details on Wowhead)<br />
* It will feature 5 bosses, and an Algalon-style optional and ultra-hard boss. (The &quot;horrific&quot; secret?) (Details on Wowhead<br />
<br />
please acctually read all the blue posts before you whine about there being a 5 man dungeon in grim batol also...</div></div><hr />

Fuck sake, do they know the meaning of subtlety? Why not just say &quot;Hur hur old god ganna eat joo&quot;.<br />
<br />
Not that that's a bad thing, having an Old God there. My money's on a resurrected C'thun, considering the TERRIBLE SECRET is right below Cho'gall, who recently tried to rezz him.</div></div><hr />

War between dwarf factions, Ironforge/Wildhammer won, but since the Queen died in Grim Batol which used to be Wildhammer's home, they left? Then the Twilight Cult moved in, and then Deathwing moved in? Yeah, I'm THAT basic about it, help out</div></div><hr />
