Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 is coming to PC exclusively on Battle.Net, with a release date of October 12! All of the existing Blizzard social features will work in the game. There will be dedicated servers, 4K support, an uncapped framerate, HDR, and more!<br />

<br />
They should allow a free token market similar to EVEs, and let the players set the price.<br />
While there are similarities the EVE Plex and the WoW Token function differently in a very important aspect. With EVE Plex you can invest in it, and the market supports investing from the ground up. With Plex you can buy with ISK and resell a few months later in ISK again. Their economy is built entirely different to support that kind of playstyle. It's very interesting but it just wouldn't work in WoW.<br />
<br />
As someone that plays both EVE and WoW, they have similar player feedback towards PLEX that you see about the WoW Token. Almost the exact same, so just adopting their market wouldn't magically fix what problems you think it has. Us regulating its growth and decay allows us to keep it from fluctuating too wildly and impacting server economies. You'd be pretty upset if you bought a WoW token and in the time it took you to list it on the market its value dropped 40% because someone decided to unload and crash the value. That can happen in EVE. That's not really a negative about the game, its just designed to allow that kind of market behavior.<br />
<br />
While it's validating to have a blue post in response to this, your response doesn't really address the main issue -- a game outside of World of Warcraft (and Blizzard) is going to be influencing its economy.<br />
Adding games to the launcher doesn't influence WoW's economy. It influences the cost of the token, sure. However it doesn't affect the overall economy. <br />
<br />
Tokens do not inject gold into the economy. The same gold always exists. If the price jumps up 50k someone is still paying that 50k that already existed and someone will receive that same 50k.<br />
<br />
It reduces the value of gold in regard specifically to the Token because the Token itself is worth more but it doesn't change the value of say flasks or food or change the amount of gold circulating between players. There is gold inflation naturally through expansions but its not because of the Token or adding things to the launcher or Battle.net store.<br />
<br />
So if tokens are sold out that means all the available gold is now locked away in tokens.<br />
No. That means that not enough players have bought tokens. It's happening right now. People aren't buying enough tokens with real money to satisfy the demand so the tokens are selling out.<br />
<br />
Untill these tokens are converted back into gold, the total ammount of gold available will have to come from in game rewards, thus increasing the total ammount of in game gold.<br />
You can't convert a token &quot;back into gold&quot;. Doing those activities would still increase gold in the economy regardless of tokens being present or not.<br />
<br />
Then, if a mass sell off happens, the token price should drop significantly untill the gold is again locked up in an even larger number of tokens.<br />
The price can only increase or decrease so much an hour. If a mass sell off were to happen the same amount of gold would still exist in the economy. Tokens at their time of purchase have a fixed value of what they were worth at that time. You cannot gain or lose value of it once it is bought. <br />
<br />
Repeat until things even out or crash.<br />
It can't unless you have another way to counteract the inflation. The price could crash very slowly but again the same gold still exists unless there is something else removing it (vendors, repairs, AH cuts, etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd guess so. I wouldn't buy the game, but if i can just dump some of my gold into bnet balance, i'll probably buy it now.<br />
<br />
And yea, expect a huge spike in wow token prices. If Destiny 2 being the crap game it was had a huge impact, i can't begin to imagine how much this will affect it.</div></div><hr />

It's like the worst qualities and business practices possible out of every FPS ever made combined into one awful franchise. It doesn't even have an interesting theme to make up for it; it's miserably boring and one of the most toxic communities I've ever experienced in the brief time I've played any of their games.<br />
<br />
I really wish I could hide Destiny 2 on my B.net browser already and disable all popup advertisements for them, as I will never invest a penny into the game (nor would I play it if it was completely free), but Call of Duty is taking this to a whole new level. Reiterating on what I already said, I really, really hope I don't have to start seeing popups for this shitty franchise in my B.net browser for Blizzard's games.</div></div><hr />

Did they actually say this? I don't recall it, but it wouldn't surprise me. I remember Blizzard saying in WotLK that the merge wouldn't impact how they design the game. The best part was that some people actually believed it. :confused:</div></div><hr />

Well by that logic N Sane Trilogy should be a Battle.net exclusive. And it's not.<br />

If Activision is bold enough to put Call of Duty in the B.net launcher, I would not be surprised if they move their other franchises with any kind of online play onto it as well. Just give it time.<br />

By adding Call of Duty, they could literally add anything at this point. The bar can't be lowered further than it is.</div></div><hr />

It's already on Steam for preorder. They are not going to go to the effort of moving it off. Nor will they do it for older CoD games.<br />
<br />
Literally Destiny and CoD are the only really big franchises they have. Skylanders is barely even known these days and that is very unlikely to go on Battle.net.<br />
<br />
This is more than likely for future titles to test the water.</div></div><hr />

WW2 made over a billion in sales by the end of 2017. It generated half of that in 3 days of release.<br />

What does Steam have to do with anything? Or am I missing something here?<br />
<br />
I mean, obviously it will still be sold on Steam, its online play will be connected to Battle.net. It will make this the first Steam game integrated into battle.net though, and that's certainly curious. And this won't prevent CoD from appearing on consoles, either... I don't think anyone is assuming that, but I still feel I should point that out. It just means they are using battle.net for connecting players online through the various Blizzard games.</div></div><hr />

I was referring to N Sane Trilogy. I don't think it actually has online play other than time trials being uploaded. I guess that's probably the reason it's not on there.<br />

I don't see Activision putting any older games on the app personally. Just newer ones. Although if it's Destiny and CoD I'll just ignore them after Destiny 2.</div></div><hr />

I mean sure I fucking hate CoD but it's still a very successful franchise.<br />
<br />
They worded it poorly; the earlier Call of Duty games (the ones before Modern Warfare or whatever) were liked by a lot more players than now, and they have very different business practices IIRC. I didn't play them then, but I also had nothing against them back then. Times have changed.<br />

I disagree personally.<br />
<br />
As I said I'm not fond of CoD personally but if it's making half a billion dollars still within 3 days of launch that's hardly a dead franchise.</div></div><hr />

Oh I can ignore them, but not if they announce every DLC and 'expansion' that these awful franchises have in all of my battle.net games' pages.

<br />
Which is what most people say at the reveal of each new CoD that comes around. And to some degree, yes. Does it affect me and my enjoyment of the game? Nope. But I suppose that's true for most games, like WoW. Each expansion could be said to be nothing but a re-skinned version of the previous, and that's fine for me as well. However, with what was stated during the reveal stream, most of the stuff in this particular CoD seem to point the otherway. They've reworked how all weapons, recoils and models work.<br />
<br />
As well as added a whole new depth to the graphical and CPU usage of the game with support for HDR, 4K support, uncapped framerate, a much better FoV. The list goes on. And I'm hyped af at this point. I have always loved the movement system and 'feel' of CoD games, the combat system etc. So to play Black Out and enjoy Battle Royal games with those movements, and that combat system, is just perfect for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not calling it a dead franchise, I'm saying that it's dead to a lot of the people that liked the franchise in its younger days. I'm not sure how that's hard to confuse. Unfortunately, it remains successful because there are a lot of players with relatively bad taste in FPS, but that's neither here nor there. Its monetary success has little to do with whether or not it retains the same core playerbase it started with. <br />
<br />
This isn't any different for Blizzard, either... how many people who started playing Diablo and Diablo 2 still play in Diablo 3? Not all of them, certainly. Same for early players of World of Warcraft and current ones, or even Starcraft vs Starcraft 2. The difference in these cases though, are that those games aren't really bad, they just are different and don't appeal to the same audience. Activision on the other hand regularly manipulates its audiences to profit as much as possible, and it's truly disturbing to see their hands on Blizzard franchises doing the same thing. <br />
<br />
There's a reason why people are upset about seeing CoD on the launcher, it's more about the fact that Activision continues to impact Blizzard negatively and will only get worse, than &quot;omg CoD is on the launcher now&quot;. I'm just sayin'. It's a sign of Activision's continued negative influence on Blizzard and a sign of worse days yet to come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard makes an effort to create quality content, Activision literally recycles the same concept on a yearly basis. Absolutely nothing in Call of Duty can be applied to WoW except that both are games designed to make money (like almost every game in existence), and unfortunately, both now share the same launcher.<br />
<br />
But don't let me get in the way of your condescending attitude telling people to 'turn off their PC and go outside' while trolling on an online message board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are only available when people are selling them. If you keep trying, you'll get one. If you give up, you won't get one until the market stabilizes a bit (or people start to log off and stop checking later in the evening, whichever happens first). It's up to you how badly you want these tokens.<br />
<br />
Most players are smart enough -- if they actually sell WoW tokens -- to hold off for a while since the prices are going up, but many more don't realize that it's on the rise, or even have enough patience to care. Just keep trying. Or don't worry about it.</div></div><hr />

You think it takes a day? It literally went up more than the entire daily variation in a single price update just moments after the game became available.

Wow, I forgot about this. The fact that they blatantly lied about this is incredibly disturbing. They are becoming even more shameless than they were previously. And the more they can get away with, the more they'll try.<br />
<br />
There's no way they could not have had plans on adding more when it was such a short time frame apart; at best Destiny was a test, at worst they were doing it slowly in hopes people would tolerate Call of Duty better. One event I do remember was Activision alluding or implying that they would like to see Call of Duty having a subscription when they were comparing Call of Duty to World of Warcraft. They've probably been building up to this for a while.<br />

There is literally a limit to how quickly the price can rise. It will take a day for it to max out (or at least a few hours, it won't happen immediately because it can't happen immediately), but in the meantime it will obviously be difficult to buy a token at the current price.</div></div><hr />

People hate on Call of Duty because it's a mediocre franchise with deplorable business tactics and they release new games constantly, keeping it in the public eye. Nothing &quot;edgy&quot; about that, kiddo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually there's an extremely high chance we'll soon see Warcraft III on the launcher given the very significant work they put into it recently, and Starcraft has been there for a while. If they are in fact planning to remaster Warcraft III, it will probably appear there once they launch that remastery.<br />
<br />
I doubt Warcraft II will show up any time soon, but who knows.. it might be next on their list. It was definitely an interesting game. It's still playable on modern machines though, and was not the most popular game in the series by any stretch of the imagination. Diablo II is a more likely candidate, or even Warcraft: Orcs vs Humans (since it literally will not run on modern machines normally). <br />
<br />
That said, Warcraft II certainly doesn't run well... nor did Starcraft before they updated it.</div></div><hr />

Dranlord, what therealbrowser says is true. It takes planning and time to integrate to another social/multiplayer platform. This was already in the works when they announced it a year ago.<br />
<br />
Their phrasing of a year ago says they are evaluating but they have no plan for third-party and its solely around Destiny 2.... This is not the case as we can see. You want to protect &amp; love Blizzard? Sure. But stop drinking KoolAids.</div></div><hr />

Uh, what? No, these things are planned in advance. Activision has done this before, saying one thing then doing another when the time was right. They are trying to manage people's reaction to them doing shitty things. <br />
<br />
It's like how one day they might claim that they aren't going to change how Blizzard handles their games, the next moment we find Diablo 3 having a real money auction house. Not long after, WoW tokens literally make it so that Blizzard Activision can directly profit off of gold buying/selling.<br />
<br />
Either way, big companies regularly plan out several years in advance. Where you are assuming that they wouldn't is beyond me, but that has literally never been the case for as long as I've been alive, and I've been around for at least a little while now.</div></div><hr />

Who are they aiming for with this? The battle royale players will not pick this over the current popular games. <br />
The players that actually like CoD and Black Ops as it always was might not like this new direction either.<br />

It's already happening. Even if Call of Duty can't be bought with Blizzard balance (it will be, it's on the Bnet launcher), the price of WoW tokens is still going to skyrocket in the short term, and unlike how the price spikes up, it never spikes down.</div></div><hr />

The REAL bowser wouldn't be such a chump. The post from blizzard regarding this very clearly says this is a possibility: <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Our focus in terms of supporting non-Blizzard games is solely around Destiny 2. Aside from potentially evaluating needs or opportunities for future Activision games, we don’t have any short- or long-term plans to support third-party games with Battle.net. It’s important to us to maintain our quality standards for any experience or service we’re putting in front of our players, which represents a big investment of time and effort on our part, so this is not something we’re jumping into lightly.&quot; <br />
<br />
Like what more do you want? When they put that statement out they had an agreement for Destiny 2. They were not ready to announce anything about Black Ops and possibly didn't even know if it would end up being a thing at that time or not. Doesn't matter because they said they would be evaluating games in the future. It is most definitely not a lie and hardly even an omission since there is no way for us to know when the decision was made to add black ops 4. A year is a long time.</div></div><hr />

So yeah maybe this was plan years on advance, still i dont see how this affect any other game form blizzard outside the advertises for a DLC, that arent that common.<br />
<br />
I'm just going to assume you're trolling at this point, because no one would make posts like this without checking. If you are not trolling, I truly feel sorry for you, because you are making an extreme fool of yourself at this point. Taking two seconds on Google will confirm all of these things; all you are doing at this point is showing how little knowledge you have on Blizzard's history, let alone how corporations operate in general.<br />
<br />
That said, your last comment that the advertisements for DLC aren't common, yeah... that's true, but they still show up, and I can't choose to prevent them from doing so. There is nothing Activision or Blizzard can do that will make me buy Destiny 2 or Call for Duty, all they are doing by popping up those ugly advertisements is pushing me away from their other games. <br />
<br />
I'm not really even a fan of unrelated Blizzard games showing up on them; there are plenty of people that don't like FPS and don't care about Overwatch, for instance, and plenty more that hate MMORPGs but love RTS or whatever else.<br />
<br />
Either way, it's a symptom of worse things to come, and that's why it's disturbing. It's not that big of a deal in and of itself, I'll continue to ignore it but Destiny 2 is a lot less offensive than Call of Duty. I hate even hearing about that miserable franchise, and now I'll see it every time I launch a Blizzard game.</div></div><hr />

I find more Toxic players in Overwatch and WoW than I ever had experienced in CoD Games. And that's not a joke or exaggeration. Especially in the newer years. Yes there are those who scream and argue, but man, I've seen so much Toxicity and &quot;cancerous&quot; players in Overwatch.</div></div><hr />

Did anyone expect they wouldn't? you have two choices, a platform that is free or a platform that takes around 30% from each sale. Lets look at BO3 and see how much they paid Valve.<br />
<br />
estimated sales - 26 million<br />
sales price - lets average it out, including sales, to $45<br />
total sales dollars - 1,170,000,000<br />
Valve cut of 30% - $351 million<br />
<br />
My math might be off a bit but that is a lot of profit that is kept.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate to admit it, but you're not entirely wrong. CoD's community, however, is far worse than any non-PvP WoW realm though, and even Starcraft and Overwatch have a relatively friendly community. But there's still that element of overwhelming toxicity now and then, and CoD players would blend right in... even if they are on average slightly worse than Blizzard's communities are at their very worst.<br />
<br />
To be fair, CoD isn't really unique in their community, though... virtually every competitive FPS has extremely toxic communities. Overwatch is highly unusual in that it has a friendly side at all.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has gone dramatically downhill in terms of quality. But we're comparing Blizzard's products with Call of Duty. It's like comparing the honor of a politician with the honor of a crime lord or something. Blizzard isn't perfect, but they at least (pretend to) try. Activision is under no allusions about it; they churn out garbage shamelessly because people shamelessly accept it. (And by garbage, I'm not even referring to the games themselves, but rather their business practices behind it.)<br />
<br />
I'm sure that there are even worse companies than Activision out there (hi, EA!), but I can't think of any individual franchises worse than Call of Duty in regards to taking advantage of it's playerbase and being successful despite it.</div></div><hr />

Well technically they added Starcraft Remastered to the b.net app recently, but it says more of Activision than it does of Blizzard that the only two truly successful franchises in their entire awful company are FPS. Unless we are counting Skylander's variable success... and that's a whole other can of worms.<br />
<br />
The odds that Blizzard is working on a new RTS is... pretty decent, actually. I suspect they are at least thinking about working on Starcraft 3 at this point, given that we're essentially at the end of Starcraft 2's life. There's not a lot else that they can (or are willing to try to) stretch out of it.<br />
<br />
Then again, though, aside from WoW (which regularly has content updates and expansions, obviously), they are largely milking their franchises right now; getting maximum profits for minimum effort. So it's entirely possible that Blizzard isn't working on much of anything except 'extra content' for their games, like new Starcraft 2 commanders, Diablo 3 seasons, or Hearthstone cards. Who knows for sure, though, besides Blizzard?</div></div><hr />

True, but that was just remastered, regurgutated stuff, its not something really new. There is coming really awesome new stuff in the rpg , or I hope so at least, DA new, Witcher would been awesome to have, RTS is well, limping with the release of ME Andromeda but I am sure there is companies out there that could make awesome stuff.<br />
<br />
I hope they do not let Starcraft franchise die with the end of the SCII, the patches with co-op and the nova missions are just that patches, it needs to evolve into something.<br />

It hasn't been about what Blizzard wanted for about a decade now. The moment they merged with Activision, the bottom line became exclusively about money, instead of quality. And as time goes on, that spectrum shifts further and further towards maximum profit as opposed to quality products.<br />
<br />
That said, what &quot;Blizzard&quot; even is at this point is questionable. They've changed so much as a result of the merge that they really aren't comparable with their old company anyways; they've cycled out almost everyone that worked on the original World of Warcraft by now, for instance.</div></div><hr />

Partially true, but I mean, Vivendi is putting them in this position in the first place but Activision is the one making it happen. If Vivendi merged them with a different company, it would likely be a different story. At least their parent company isn't EA.</div></div><hr />

Activision is the company that churns out awful FPS content as fast as they can. Blizzard still develops its own franchises; it's just done under Activision's supervision. Activision probably plays a bigger role in choosing what they end up working on and more importantly, how they can monetize it to exaggerated levels as opposed to actually playing a part in developing any of it (thankfully).<br />
<br />
Activision's awful franchises shouldn't be on the b.net launcher to begin with, so I wouldn't compare anything they've created with anything blizzard has created; you might as well pretend Activision doesn't exist and is a different company, because nothing Activision creates with its awful games are going to have anything to do with what Blizzard does, except when it comes to monetizing content.</div></div><hr />

Thats not that much more than what I paid for one last month, I paid about 340k so really the price hasn't been inflated that much and the people rolling in gold will still be able to use gold to keep their subscription going.

I think most of the people who are annoyed are so because this game being available through the Bnet launcher means it will be purchasable with battle.net balance. Which will directly impact the wow-token price. So a game that is in no way related to WoW aside from Blizzards relationship with Activision, will (again) impact a market that is specific to WoW (or to a smaller extent other blizzard games via bnet balance). Many players pay for their subs exclusively through the token as well, and while they expect the price to go up when a new WoW expansion is released; a game like CoD or Destiny 2 impacting their World of Warcraft sub is rather silly.</div></div><hr />

It's like the worst qualities and business practices possible out of every FPS ever made combined into one awful franchise. It doesn't even have an interesting theme to make up for it; it's miserably boring and one of the most toxic communities I've ever experienced in the brief time I've played any of their games.<br />
<br />
I really wish I could hide Destiny 2 on my B.net browser already and disable all popup advertisements for them, as I will never invest a penny into the game (nor would I play it if it was completely free), but Call of Duty is taking this to a whole new level. Reiterating on what I already said, I really, really hope I don't have to start seeing popups for this shitty franchise in my B.net browser for Blizzard's games.<br />
<br />
The very first CoD games were really, REALLY good. Like, I'd say Call of Duty+United Offensive and Call of Duty 2 are among the best FPS games of all time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone will complain about everything and anything. It's just the way things are. Some think Activision &quot;invading&quot; B.Net with 2 titles is somehow violating B.Net's safe space.<br />
<br />
Companies can do no absolute good. Criticism and being anonymous is a hell of a thing. Everyone thinks they're someone online and think their opinion matters more :( Can't just let things be anymore.</div></div><hr />

Planing to add the biggest game Activation have that is CoD multiplayer community to a already establish PC-game launcher. That is a successful business decision.<br />

&quot;Taking our subsidiary's proprietary launcher and turning it into Activision Origin&quot; is a good decision... for Activision.<br />

This is enough to make me want to stop using the launcher entirely, or even stop playing games from Blizzard entirely if it was absolutely unavoidable to use that launcher.<br />

<br />
I don't mean 'quit playing them forever', I meant that I'm less likely to play them, and have less interest because every time I use the launcher -- which I learned today I also am forced to use, I can't launch games from their .exe's -- I have to utilize a launcher that goes out of its way to express them. But hell, you know, this might just push me over the edge coincidentally.<br />
<br />
It's just a little bit more every time from Activision, but something at some point is going to be the breaking point. In a sense, this could be it. Forcing one of my most hated franchises of all time onto the launcher alongside many of which used to be my favorite games, is a bit of a bigger deal for me than you're making it out to be. I don't want to see advertisements for that game, and now I'm probably going to be forced to view them since they'll be very blatantly placed on the launcher and I have no way to hide the game itself from appearing.<br />
<br />
I'm already feeling this; I've been playing through starcraft II's campaign the past couple days for fun, but after this whole ordeal, I'm really not feeling like going back into it right now. I might not. You're treating this like I'm threatening Blizzard or something, while I'm treating it as the irony it is, because this would be the straw that broke the camel's back -- if you're even familiar with that analogy. <br />
<br />
How much garbage should one take from Activision before moving on? It's only going to get worse from here at any rate, and this is kind of a breaking point for me that Blizzard has dropped the bar so low that they now share the Launcher for Call of Duty and what is sure to be every single shitty yearly release. A couple years from now, I might see 3-4 Call of Duty games or more, so it's not 'just a line on the screen', they churn out this garbage yearly.  And it will constantly be in my face. <br />

They can add as many games to the Bnet launcher as they want, imho. The ones I want to play, I'll buy, the ones I don't care about, I'll ignore. Oooh snap, what's that?

Well... the whole token thing was a desaster from the moment when it stopped being WoW exclusive. A disaster for WoW, that is. Probably not so much for other games. I wonder how the sales for these titles would have looked like without tokens. You know, it's easier to shell out some &quot;game money&quot; for things compared to hard cash.

For you, it might not be personal preference, but going by what so many in this thread is whinging about, it sounds very much like it is personal preference. Down to a unhealthy level. Scroll through some pages and see, granted yes, a few people talk about the WoW economy.

<br />
Give it a couple years and there will be more Call of Duty games on the launcher than Blizzard's games in total, given that Call of Duty literally has yearly releases. And I'm sure you'd still try to act like it's no big deal. &quot;It doesn't matter to me, therefore it can't matter to anyone.&quot; Yeah, that logic doesn't really work, but it's not like I was expecting you to be anything other than narrow-minded. I really need to stop giving people the benefit of the doubt, especially on communities such as this one that practically encourage this kind of blatant toxicity.<br />
<br />
I do want to correct you, however. For my own sake. I'm not distressed by the fact Call of Duty is on the launcher, I'm 'distressed' because Blizzard has chosen to stoop this low; it's another bar lowered by Blizzard that lets Activision get away with more. Not even a year ago, Blizzard said that 'no other Activision games were planned for the launcher' after releasing Destiny 2, because people saw this shit coming and were worried about it. Fast forward a year, lo and behold; another lie. Activision doesn't even try to be subtle anymore. Give me a day and I'll get over it, but over time there are going to be more and more Call of Duty games and Activision is going to continue blatantly lying and pushing more and more garbage. And I'm sure you'll keep gobbling it up. :p<br />
<br />
I may not like Call of Duty, and hell, I might struggle to completely ignore it given how much I dislike the franchise, but at least I don't treat people like shit simply because I disagree with them and lack the maturity (yes, that's irony) to respond in any other way. If anyone could use some growing up, I would think it's you. It takes a special type of personality to get as riled up and act as spiteful as you are over something so innocuous, and I'm not interested in humoring your miserably bad-natured attitude. I'm not going to waste my time 'discussing' this with you further, so please feel free not to respond to this; I may not be able to ignore Activision's awful games on the launcher, but I can certainly ignore your awful posts. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

From the start it's been obvious that Activision wanted to take advantage of Blizzard's success. The fact that they are listing their shit next to Blizzard's games are bad enough, but what bothers me is what this means for the future. Call of Duty has yearly releases, so given a short period of time, there will probably be more Call of Duty games than Blizzard games in total. Quite frankly, that's disturbing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you take a bucket of water, with clear water.<br />
and you dip a finger into your arse, and then place the finger into<br />
that bucket of water, if the water still pure?<br />
<br />
Some may want to drink of that water still, but some wants their water pure.<br />
<br />
So, bnet should SHOULD be for Blizzard only games, if they want to use a similar <br />
structure, why not copy of the bnet, without the blizzard games and call it Anet<br />
or similar, hence having 2 buckets, the bucket of clear water, the bucket of everything else.<br />
<br />
Ill tell you why they chose not to do this, they want their games pushed unto the wast numbers of<br />
players who play wow and diablo and starcraft etc, and they want the free publicity<br />
<br />
Clear in your head now, then dunk your head into the second bucket and ill laugh equally when your favorite <br />
game has ads of Hello Kitty in them to choke you to death of the game.<br />
<br />
And.. What if ones favorite game is WoW, but they still don't care about them adding more games to the list. And/Or maybe there are those who get excited by this.<br />
<br />
Like, why care. At all. Continue playing your favorite game in peace, your world is unaffected by this. Completely and utterly unaffected.</div></div><hr />

And I'm sure you'd still try to act like it's no big deal. &quot;It doesn't matter to me, therefore it can't matter to anyone.&quot; Yeah, that logic doesn't really work, but it's not like I was expecting you to be anything other than narrow-minded. I really need to stop giving people the benefit of the doubt, especially on communities such as this one that practically encourage this kind of blatant toxicity.<br />
<br />
I do want to correct you, however. For my own sake. I'm not distressed by the fact Call of Duty is on the launcher, I'm 'distressed' because Blizzard has chosen to stoop this low; it's another bar lowered by Blizzard that lets Activision get away with more. Not even a year ago, Blizzard said that 'no other Activision games were planned for the launcher' after releasing Destiny 2, because people saw this shit coming and were worried about it. Fast forward a year, lo and behold; another lie. Activision doesn't even try to be subtle anymore. Give me a day and I'll get over it, but over time there are going to be more and more Call of Duty games and Activision is going to continue blatantly lying and pushing more and more garbage. And I'm sure you'll keep gobbling it up. :p<br />
<br />
I may not like Call of Duty, and hell, I might struggle to completely ignore it given how much I dislike the franchise, but at least I don't treat people like shit simply because I disagree with them and lack the maturity (yes, that's irony) to respond in any other way. If anyone could use some growing up, I would think it's you. It takes a special type of personality to get as riled up and act as spiteful as you are over something so innocuous, and I'm not interested in humoring your miserably bad-natured attitude. I'm not going to waste my time 'discussing' this with you further, so please feel free not to respond to this; I may not be able to ignore Activision's awful games on the launcher, but I can certainly ignore your awful posts. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Aww, poor baby just can't handle things threatening his safe space. It's okay, the scary orange roman numerals won't hurt you.</div></div><hr />

I figure this needs to be brought up since your &quot;correction&quot; is factually wrong. In the original blueposts for Destiny 2 being launched that specifically Activision games would be possible depending on the needs or opportunities. Below is directly quoted from the blue post.<br />
<br />
Does this mean other games are going to come to the Blizzard platform too?<br />
<br />
Our focus in terms of supporting non-Blizzard games is solely around Destiny 2. Aside from potentially evaluating needs or opportunities for future Activision games, we don’t have any short- or long-term plans to support third-party games with Battle.net. It’s important to us to maintain our quality standards for any experience or service we’re putting in front of our players, which represents a big investment of time and effort on our part, so this is not something we’re jumping into lightly.</div></div><hr />

I personally don't like it, so I'll use the command prompt to open Overwatch. <br />

There are many ways around using the launcher.</div></div><hr />
