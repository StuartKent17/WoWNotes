Game designers Luis Barriga and Craig Amai sat down with us to discuss upcoming changes to Darkshore's landscape, the fate of Auberdine, and the challenges of redesigning an old-world zone from the ground up in this World of Warcraft: Cataclysm content preview.<br />
<br />
Q. What was the original concept for the zone?<br />
<br />
A. Darkshore was one of the areas hit hardest by the Cataclysm, so the main idea was to present a zone that had literally been shattered by those events. That was the approach we took for the revamp in terms of lore and aesthetics.<br />
<br />
In terms of gameplay, our goal was to take advantage of the changes to the environment and use them to help address previous issues with quest flow. It was an opportunity to streamline progression within Darkshore so that the overall experience for players would be much smoother and require less running back and forth.<br />
<br />
Q. Who will be using this zone (what levels/factions)?<br />
<br />
A. Darkshore is designed for Alliance players, primarily night elves and worgen, from level 11 through 20.<br />
<br />
Q. What is changing about the zone?<br />
<br />
A. Auberdine has been destroyed; entire species of creatures have been wiped out, and the land has been torn wide open in multiple places.<br />
<br />
The Cataclysm has also given the upper hand to a number of nearby foes, including coastal naga, Twilight's Hammer cultists, and opportunistic trolls of the Shatterspear tribe who seek to exploit weakened night elven settlements.<br />
<br />
Q. What's happened to Auberdine?<br />
<br />
A. Auberdine has been nearly razed to the ground, and what wasn't destroyed by the Cataclysm is now under assault by air elementals led by Twilight's Hammer cultists. The city is pretty much in ruins, but some survivors did make it out alive.<br />
<br />
Q. With Auberdine in ruins, where do night elves go now?<br />
<br />
A. Lor'danel. It's a small night elven town just to the north of the ruins of Auberdine.<br />
<br />
Q. Without giving up any spoilers, what's the general storyline for this zone?<br />
<br />
A. Darkshore has suffered immensely from the massive seismic ripples of the Cataclysm. The night elves are in survival mode, helping refugees and, wherever they can, fending off the advances of the Twilight's Hammer cult, the naga, and the Shatterspear trolls. Meanwhile, Malfurion Stormrage, recently returned from the Emerald Dream, has traveled to the epicenter of the destruction and called upon the ancient powers of Cenarius to contain it.<br />
<br />
Q. What do you think is the most exciting new addition to the zone?<br />
<br />
A. Without a doubt, the most exciting addition to Darkshore is the gigantic vortex in the center of the zone, where the devastating forces of the Cataclysm are being pit against the primal power of Malfurion Stormrage. Our amazing artists and level designers made us an epic energy vortex to serve as a visual centerpiece for the destruction, and it looks phenomenal.<br />
<br />
Q. What goes into redesigning a zone like this?<br />
<br />
A. Redesigning Darkshore required much more work than we originally anticipated. This was one of the first zones we tackled that centered on the effects of the Cataclysm, so we started out with the modest goal of adding a few themed quests and improving the general flow of the zone. As we piled on the visual changes, though, we soon discovered that a lot more manpower was needed to generate content that correctly reflected Darkshore's new landscape and lore.<br />
<br />
Q. What was the most challenging aspect about implementing these changes?<br />
<br />
A. At first we thought that we would be able to work with the majority of the original quests in Darkshore, but most of them just didn't make sense when viewed in the context of the zone's new storyline and direction. For example, chasing after corrupted wildlife and investigating washed-up threshers would seem out of place when everything around you is being ravaged by natural disasters, elementals, naga... and worse. Reaching the realization that we would basically have to scrap all of the old content and start from scratch -- and then actually bringing that plan to fruition -- was probably the hardest part of the process.<br />
<br />
Q. What should players do or go see first?<br />
<br />
A. Players should start in the town of Lor'danel and then play through the quest series naturally, slowly heading south. Higher-level players (levels 15 and up) may want to skip ahead and meet up with Malfurion Stormrage at the center of the zone, but Darkshore feels best if you experience the entire storyline from the beginning, as intended.<br />
<br />
Q. What's happening at the Master's Glaive? The last time we saw it, it was mostly buried underground.<br />
<br />
A. Twilight's Hammer cultists have recently begun to unearth the remains of Soggoth, one of the more powerful servants of the Old Gods, from beneath the Master's Glaive with the intent of bringing him back to life. Players will have to foil the cultists' plans before the new incarnation of Soggoth reaches full strength.<br />
<br />
Q. Is there anything new at the Grove of the Ancients?<br />
<br />
A. The Grove of the Ancients was shielded from most of the devastation caused by the Cataclysm, due in large part to the power of the ancient guardians residing therein. Protecting the grove required an enormous amount of energy, though, and as a result, most of the guardians have gone into a sort of slumber. Players will have to figure out a way to wake them and bring them into the fight to ensure the survival of Darkshore.<br />
<br />
Thank you, Luis and Craig, for taking the time to talk about your involvement in reshaping Darkshore for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm!<br />
<br />
<br />
I went back to the zone on beta servers and did a couple of screenshots, there are a couple of spoilers but it should be enough to get you excited about that zone. <br />

HoT and DoT refresh<br />
Dots and hots adjust on the fly now when they're refreshed. There is less reason to try and get everything lined up perfectly for big numbers before you cast the spell. You'll be able to game it a little bit for the initial spell duration, but it won't refresh infinitely with the big numbers.<br />
<br />
We have to rebalance the entire game anyway given the magnitude of the Cataclysm changes, so don't worry about being penalized for any old mechanics that may no longer be relevant. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435494804/what-warlocks-would-like-to-see-answered/))<br />

Healer mana balance<br />
Healer mana is completely balanced around encounter length. If we had 30 minute long encounters, this would be a problem, but we don't. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435494804/what-warlocks-would-like-to-see-answered/))<br />

Pet Scaling<br />
I verified that they do in fact scale. However, as I said the first time, you are unlikely to even be able to notice one way or the other so this seemed like an odd thing to be concerned about.<br />
<br />
Likewise, the amount of dps loss due to pet scaling from a Destro warlock who stacked mastery and a Demo warlock who stacked mastery would probably be on the order of less than 1%.<br />
<br />
Scaling is very important, but keep it in perspective. Forum posters have a tendency to over worry about the problem. If you were going to get gear that gave you 10,000 mastery, then the numbers would get out of whack, but that's not going to happen, at least before we rebalance everything again. The scaling only has to last for 3-4 raid tiers. Warlocks not scaling with crit or haste were very real problems. Situational pets not scaling with gear or pets in general not scaling from one secondary stat are going to have pretty small impacts on the numbers.

Demon Soul<br />
We understand the concern about Demon Soul. We added that based on early feedback that the Soul Shards were too utility focused and might be ignored on the typical boss fights. The design we have at the moment isn't final. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435494804/what-warlocks-would-like-to-see-answered/))<br />

The PR Fluff is actually very intriguing. A good part of the game is absorbing all the lore and feeling truly like a hero running around, and its interesting to get more insight on how Zones have been changed and how it happens. Not much PR fluff in those posts imho.</div></div><hr />

Shatterspears are the aggressors in this new quest chain, just FYI. However, they DID manage to finally pull off what the Night elves had been screwing around on for ages -- destroy the Tower of Althalaxx. Of course, the people that originally headed up the quests against Althalaxx are no longer around, seeing that the location they used to occupy is being shelled 24/7 by an advancing Horde front through Ashenvale. Maybe that's why they never managed to finish off the Dark Strand cult....<br />

It's because they are pissed off and want to completely eliminate the threat? It would seem the Shatterspear attack them just because the Night Elves are weakened. Ofcourse that makes the Nelfs angry.<br />
Obviously the tide turns when they manage to wake the Ancients from their slumber.<br />

Darkshore actually sounds cool, though it is sad that the worgen have barely any presence in there. You'd think there would be more helping the night elves out there considering they've both basically teamed up and are /brofist'ing.<br />

Well, that's just what disturbed me when reading the Q&amp;A. &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
When someone attacks you, you &quot;fend them off&quot;, i.e. you fight them to defend yourself and hopefully stop the attacks. When they continue to attack you, you go &quot;limit their resources&quot;, i.e. cut off their ability to attack you by destroying their base of operations. This is basic RTS stuff, nearly every RTS has at least a couple of missions where you're defending a base area and then once you build sufficient resources you counter attack.</div></div><hr />

I know I have no plans to level yet another toon and any race. If any of the new races seems interesting enough to use then I would just pay a few dollars when the race change becomes available.<br />
<br />
I know there are quite a few players that have no plans to level there 5th toon. There are many that have every toon already maxed. Why would you level the same toon a second time. I just can't find the interest in the zones that are below 80-85. Granted, if your a new WOW gamer or one of those people that would level a toon twice then maybe this is for you. I just can't see it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm also curious on what Horde players will have to do here. I saw at least one video where a belf player witnesses the exchange of words between Malfurion (who had a red name to the belf just to make all you Alliance heads a little happier ^_^ ) and Azshara. At the end he talks to the player and basically says &quot;meet you in Hyjal, we have work to do.&quot; So if this is an all Alliance zone, where does Horde involvement come into play to get to that point? :-/</div></div><hr />

they always had an FP at the strand at the furthest west of auberdine and with ashenvale under siege; that FP point is now a fully fledged fortress, the horde could have easily pushed forward into darkshore</div></div><hr />

This. I mean WTF? It's an 11-20 zone. That means off-limits to the opposing faction.<br />

<br />
Why are you confused? It is clear that Soggoth is a very powerful servant of the Old Gods, maybe second in command and have a lot of properties like the Old Gods. He can resurrect himself, have his own army, etc. <br />
<br />
He was suppose to be an Old God, but it was just speculation. Nothing was finale. Old God, after Old God would have become boring very quickly. This gives the Old Gods story more flavor. They just didn't have their personal powerful servants, like generals. But have second in command servants. Someone who takes care of things when Old Gods can't do it (like how they are dead and need someone very loyal to run their business).</div></div><hr />

Ah, see I was just wondering why they said servant when I thought they had previously said he was an Old God.<br />
<br />
This probably means that Isorath is also a servant of the Old Gods. (Those tentacles around the giant Sarlacc-looking thing in the Weeping Wound in the Twilight Highlands are called<br />
Tentacles of Isorath.) I'm not saying that tentacles = old god but that thing does look curiously Old God-like.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's made for new players AND people like me who only have 6 80's on one server and still have 4 they would like to make. <br />
<br />
Personally, I enjoy making characters and experiencing the quests far more than I enjoy the end-game crap. When I'm done making these 10 level 80 horde toons, I will go make 10 level 80 alliance toons. Heck, maybe I'll even do it on a pvp server instead of a pve server this time, just to say I did it. It'll be fun!</div></div><hr />

Also, to those confused, it's purely storilyne progression, first the Shaterpear are trying to exploit the Night Elves in a time of weekness, but in the end the Night Elves resist and counter attack (Resiting Ngas, Twilight Cultist, Shatterspear, while your main city on the area is gone, and you still can wipe out one of them from existance?

I actually went through and checked that. While i did not uncover enough of them to actually spawn the cat, the statuettes were still there and acted as they do on live.<br />

Totalbiscuit is currently making a video series focusing on his Worgen leveling in Darkshore, so you could go watch that (Here's the first part: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFTopf7rb4g). Also, unless they do some rebalancing, it will probably be more like 13/14 to 20. Worgen starting zone puts you a little high for the beginning quests of Darkshore but some of them are well worth the storytelling anyway.</div></div><hr />

haha lol, yeah i remeber the good ol days leveling allaince alts, darkshore was definately a place to avoid.Once you were high enough to exit the starting zones you were high enough to make the long trek to goldshire and westfall which was always my favorite of questing zones.It always did encourage a friendly atmoshpere.Even after i slowly began to go horde terrorizing sentinel hill was something i enjoyed.</div></div><hr />

Well for one, look closely, those are Murloc marines (I think) and Zergling pets. For two, MMOChampion, while specified towards WoW, is not restricted to it and therefore reserves the right to discuss anything and everything in general.

<br />
A. Darkshore is designed for Alliance players, primarily night elves and worgen, from level 11 through 20.<br />
<br />
<br />
This doesn't make sense for the Worgen. How will they safely get from their starting zone in the Eastern Kingdoms all the way to the western side of Kalimdor at level eleven?<br />
<br />
At the end of the Worgen starting zone, you get on a boat to Darnassus.</div></div><hr />
