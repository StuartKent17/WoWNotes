A few pets will be added with the upcoming patch, most of them are from the Argent Tournament and a few were added for holiday events.

Naxxramas Speed Runs<br />
The Sartharion speed-run video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwu9HKICyiE) was quite popular and I got a few mails about it, now is the time for 2 Naxxramas speed run! The first one is from Loke's List (http://www.lokes-list.dk/forum/portal.php) (EU-Mazrigos), these guys managed to clear Naxxramas-25 in ... 1 hour and 12 minutes. <br />
<br />
Even if Naxxramas isn't really hard in Wrath of the Lich King, it's always impressive to see 15 bosses and their trash killed in such a short amount of time. (That's a boss every 5 minute) <br />

<br />
<br />
The growing interest in speed-runs could be a good thing, even if we probably won't see as many of them after the release of Ulduar. I'm not really sure we could turn that into a competition though, logs and videos are easily edited and it would become a problem when people start fighting for a few seconds to get a world record ... but it definitely would be interesting to see it tracked in-game as part of the Achievements statistics. <br />

You gonna lose dps in overall spliting groups. But would be very interesting having two separated groups running the same raid, new hard mode? lol</div></div><hr />

All it was was chain pulling with no afks and no loot distribution. Loot distribution takes at least 1 hour when you combine a run. Afks normally take another hour when you combine them as a run. That is 2 hours right there so taking those things into account then an average run of 3 hours is a &quot;speed run&quot; and most guilds have been clearing Naxx25 in 3 hours for a very long time.</div></div><hr />

Really? One hour for loot and another for AFKing? ...Its OK if this doesnt interest you, but your statement is a load of b...... - Obviously you havent tried it, you should, its fun! (At least more fun than spending 3 hours doing it ;)<br />

That first speed run video. Hit play, turn up the sound and enjoy. Seriously good music. Anyone know which album they used for it. It's obviously a mix.<br />
<br />
Thank You ;) - Im glad someone besides me liked it, hehe. Mostly old tracks on purpose, amateur-homemade mixing. And yes, the other poster was right, its two tracks from the Celldweller FiXT remix compilation plus UNKLE, Leftfield, Crystal Method and The Prodigy.<br />

Take care!<br />

<br />
For an explanation I gave them &quot;I originally rolled an Undead Rogue. My bad.&quot; then I informed them of some of my other reasons:<br />
<br />
Asshole community (Elitist Jerks ain't just a cool domain name, baby! It describes 90% of the raiding community on my realms) - most people you'll encounter are friendly, but people think too highly of themselves (they see themselves as Gods because they lead a raid or two.)<br />
<br />
Engineering Profession is weaksauce. Hey, if they have a 'Will of the Forsaken nerf' as a pre-fab reason for why you quit.. might as well give them some constructive criticisms. I picked Engineering as a profession because it gave me some unique things to a rogue: a resurrection, injectors (tbc), .. umm.. goggles WERE a close-to-best-in-slot, nowadays, not so much.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'll be back, but I finally cancelled for a while. Feels good.</div></div><hr />

I guess everyones definition of fun is different. I think fun is more like shooting the shit and not being so serious while in the run. It's nice when it's not all GOGOGO DPS HARD, you know?</div></div><hr />

I feel like an idiot asking for this, But whats the 1s song @ Naxx speed run of Loke's List(EU-Mazrigos)?<br />
<br />
Nothing idiotic about asking. As mentioned by a knowledgable listener earlier in the thread, its &quot;Celldweller - Own Little World (Remixed by Remorse Code &amp; Blue Stahli)&quot; from the FiXT remix comp.<br />

Happy Easter to all of you.<br />

I wouldn't necessarily say a speed run is a serious one, I personally would love to do a speed run of Naxx would make things a bit more interesting in there for me. Being in an instance where everyone has everything they need for Main and Off specs isn't fun. Clearing said instance in minimal time while bsing in vent? Sounds like a great time to me.</div></div><hr />

I'll just be assuming though that the healers are good enough to protect everyone from a few hits before the mobs are faceplanted.</div></div><hr />

Also, what is up with adding TONS of BoE pets and only a few BoP mounts in this patch, when it's way (way, WAY) harder to get 100 mounts than 75 pets? If they're going to add all these pets, we need a 100 pets achievement, and a 75 mount achievement would be nice as a midpoint since the stretch from 50 to 100 involves getting like a dozen 1% drops (and winning the rolls).<br />

You mean Gothik?<br />
<br />
We stayed on living side and killed everything. After a certain amount of time (fixed timer) the gate will open and all the spawned undead mobs will rush towards living side. We kill that and then it's just kill living -&gt; kill undead.</div></div><hr />

To be more precise: As soon as the first horseman respawns on undead side the gate opens and they rush living.</div></div><hr />

Ah, cool, thanks. Sounds like a reasonable way of doing it, if you can handle the initial add rush doing it that way. (And since it's mostly trainees and a few death knights at that point, not a huge amount of dps needed.)<br />
<br />
And yes, I meant Gothik. Posting when extremely tired FTL. Glad to see people are still quick to freak out at the smallest mistakes though. :P Context is so hard to figure out! Yes, Heigan has a live and dead side and adds, zomg! Let's kite him to Vael's room!</div></div><hr />
