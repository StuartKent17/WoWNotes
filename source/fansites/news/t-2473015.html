100% agree. Then you've got delusional people here who say the previous ones were &quot;good&quot; or &quot;decent&quot;. I'm just like... Wow. I mean I'm all for defending a game you love, but, when it's THIS bad... How can you??

I actually expect 8.2 on the PTR this week or next.<br />
<br />
The presence of the Q and A makes me think this week is likelier, and given they will need some time to collect some questions that are relevant, I suspect it is VERY imminent.<br />

<br />
It is the save the game patch.<br />
<br />
It offers two new landmasses. Two new dungeons (Mechagon split into two). A new raid. A new world quest system. A new Azerite armour system (and the jettisoning of the horrendously flawed old one) and laying the ground for the next Allied races (Vulpera, Mecha-Gnomes and Ankora are all candidates, with the first two being practically shoe-ins).<br />
<br />
Haven't felt this excited about WoW news since the 8.1 preview but 8.2 is going to be a gargantuan patch, maybe even the biggest they have ever done.</div></div><hr />

We have been struggling for the past few years to recruit for raiding due in large part to saturation of the players on our realm (US - Connected Moonrunner). From forums on OpenRaid it doesn't appear our realm is unique with this situation.<br />
<br />
According to realmpop and wowprogress (which I know aren't official but as close as I can find) out of the 143,622 toons on our server only 3,463 are active raiding toons. Compare this to, say, Stormrage and you could connect the bottom 9 US PVE realms on Pacfic Time Zone to get a server as populated with active toons. Even connecting the bottom 3 PVE PDT realms and you get a similar total character pop as Stormrage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But if 8.2 PTR launch tomorrow, we will see huge whinefest when people will see first sketch of 8.2 artifact system. So Q&amp;A is needed (+ 8.2 PTR is close anyway and I don't see them doing extra Q&amp;A in 2-3 weeks.<br />
<br />
<br />
When are we going to see patch 8.2 on the PTR I'd like to know what i need to get prepared and do for pathfinder part two :)<br />

I guess explore Nazjatar&amp;Mechagon, do 8.2 campaign and get revered with new rep or reps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is this is when they’re going to announce that it’s going to come up on the PTR. It makes the most sense to announce it there. Plus, we know it’s coming very soon as they themselves have said it’s going to be up on PTR very shortly after 8.1.5 goes live.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bobsandwich</div><div class="date">2019-03-18, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no idea if this has been suggested or previously addressed (most likely has), but I'll ask ahead anyway.<br />
<br />
Many vendors were removed in Legion and the start of BfA (PvP and PvE) due to a multitude of reasons, one being that it was to reduce the players error of purchasing something incorrectly and being stuck with it. <br />
<br />
We now have Azerite vendors, and are trusted to purchase a 415 specific mythic item for over 7k residue (So atleast a good 2months +/- of farming) <br />
However we are still kind of lackluster in PvP vendors. I know we have the new quartermaster, with 10 coins rewarding a Sigil, however this means we still need to have a gear piece to pair with it (coming from RnG drops and Conquest rewards) and the sufficient rating for the Sigil to be worth it, max currently only being an item boosted to ilvl 405 (and with 2.4k+ Glad rating?* I may be wrong here, apologies if so.)<br />
<br />
So I guess what I'm asking is, will we ever see more changes to PvP vendors in the future, perchance something similar to the Azerite traders? Giving us a choice of Ilvl sets and random piece choices.<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
A minute sounds more reasonable to me. That way, if the Q&amp;A is only 50 minutes long, and it takes ten seconds to read each question, he can get through approximately 42 questions (6 questions and answers taking 7 minutes).</div></div><hr />

Won't be new at all. Will just be the same quests with the same fill the bar mechanic but related to the current content to make it sound like they are new.<br />
<br />
Look at the Naga &quot;incursions&quot;. It's literally 1 world quest in a different zone and people are acting like it's hot content.<br />

If the world quest system actually gets full on new stuff in 8.2 I'll buy all my friends still playing 6 months of game time. :)</div></div><hr />

If the world quest system actually gets full on new stuff in 8.2 I'll buy all my friends still playing 6 months of game time. :)<br />
<br />
Wait, that's all the incursions are? I thought they were going to basically be the invasions from Legion? :confused:</div></div><hr />

Nah they made Naga ones or well world quests with this patch.<br />
<br />
It's literally 1 world quest in one zone (alternates) and it's just the usual &quot;fill the bar up&quot; crap.<br />
<br />
They literally have the fucking gall to plural it as well with &quot;quests&quot;. It's literally 1 quest that alternates between zones when it's up.</div></div><hr />

That's dumb. That's really dumb. I was hoping it was going to at least be like the Legion one, where you ran around and did multiple things that aren't usually there, then grouped up with a few people to fight your way to a mini-boss.</div></div><hr />

Well the actual name they give it is &quot;attack world quests&quot;. And as I said it's literally 1 quest that just spawns in one of the 6 zones.<br />
<br />
It's not new. It's not exciting and it barely classifies as content.<br />
<br />
I mean even the &quot;new&quot; Tortollan ones aren't new. One is just the tracing thing from Azsuna in Legion and the other is basically Beachead flipped around.<br />

We already have those in BfA, just not with a naga theme.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I thought they called them incursions too. My bad.<br />
<br />
But still they can't called the Naga one &quot;quests&quot; when it's the same one but just spawns in one of the random 6 zones.<br />
<br />
None of the new world quests this patch are actually new.<br />
<br />
As I said the Tortollan one is just the Azsuna drawing quest and Beachead flipped around where you kill the turtles.</div></div><hr />

The last one was a story panel one. Not helmed by Ion. That's why it went well.</div></div><hr />

Speaking as a player on an RP server... if that happens and they don’t even consider the possibility of more merges to help low pop servers I will go absolutely fucking mental x_x</div></div><hr />

It is pretty shitty that they haven't just merged all the RP servers into the bigger ones. <br />

I have some characters on Moonglade EU and while there are people it's really really quiet unless you know where to go or who to talk with.</div></div><hr />

Wow, do you even understand English? The reason I replied to you was precisely because you didn't tell them HOW to do their job, but because you are just whining that your class should be fixed without coming up with a proper suggestion. <br />

Then you've got delusional people here who say the previous ones were &quot;good&quot; or &quot;decent&quot;. I'm just like... Wow. I mean I'm all for defending a game you love, but, when it's THIS bad... How can you?? (granted these people likely started during WoD or so, so they've never known or experienced the golden age of World of Warcraft)<br />
<br />
I prefer having this than nothing, and sometimes they say really nice or useful things, what I'm amazed is that people can't even see that and enter full rage mode with it, I agree 70% of the time or de questions are meh or stupid, but let's not pretend like there has never been something useful answered or asked, and let's not pretend that it's better if these Q&amp;A don't exists.<br />
<br />
If they do as some people say and stop doing them, later there will be tears and salt that they are scummy because they stopped doing them, and please don't deny this at least<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
As am I.<br />
<br />
It is the save the game patch.<br />
<br />
It offers two new landmasses. Two new dungeons (Mechagon split into two). A new raid. A new world quest system. A new Azerite armour system (and the jettisoning of the horrendously flawed old one) and laying the ground for the next Allied races (Vulpera, Mecha-Gnomes and Ankora are all candidates, with the first two being practically shoe-ins).<br />
<br />
Haven't felt this excited about WoW news since the 8.1 preview but 8.2 is going to be a gargantuan patch, maybe even the biggest they have ever done.<br />
<br />
Agreed 100% ^^<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
A minute sounds more reasonable to me. That way, if the Q&amp;A is only 50 minutes long, and it takes ten seconds to read each question, he can get through approximately 42 questions (6 questions and answers taking 7 minutes).<br />
<br />
If they were machines yeah sure, they do take too long answering some questions that don't deserve more than 20 sec tho, that's true. But there are also some questions that I'm glad he takes his time to explain, It's fun to see that people think that if you study law is like you get some superpowers to talk and now everything you say is lawish and scummy hahahahah</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Enhancement Shaman Redesign, anyone?<br />
<br />
It's just that the spec is completely forgotten after losing Legion artifacts and probably the original reason why I'm not playing the game anymore. If Enhancement were redesigned like Demonology was I wouldn't have had to reroll to some other class which doesn't feel like mine in the game..</div></div><hr />
