WoW Down to 7.7 Million Subscribers<br />
Activision Blizzard's press release (http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130725006767/en/Activision-Blizzard-Announces-Transformative-Purchase-Shares-Vivendi) states that World of Warcraft is down to 7.7 million subscribers. This is a loss of 600,000 subscribers, down from 8.3 million last quarter (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3241-WoW-Down-to-8-3-Million-Subscribers). A call about the shares purchase will take place on July 26 at 8:30 AM ET, so check back then for any more comments on subscriber numbers.<br />

Activision Blizzard Purchases Shares From Vivendi<br />
Activision Blizzard is purchasing 429 million shares from Vivendi for $5.8 billion. This purchase is financed with $1.2 billion of cash that was on hand and $4.6 billion of debt proceeds, leaving them with a $1.4 billion of net debt at the end of the deal in September 2013.<br />
<br />
An investment group that includes Bobby Kotick and Brian Kelly, who put up $100 million together, as well as Tencent and other partners is purchasing 172 million shares for $2.3 billion. This group will own 24.9% of the company and Vivendi will retain ownership of 83 million shares (12%) of the company.</div></div><hr />

To be fair people mostly said its activations fault, and now when they say that it could be true. I dont know whether Blizzard will still be independent in development, but hopefully this doesn't turn into another ea bioware.</div></div><hr />

I know I was getting a little bored until I decided to level some alts and start gearing some others.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nehezbegar</div><div class="date">2013-07-26, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it is normal that Blizz looses subs, nowdays players have a lot of choices which game they want to play. This is not 2004 where there were like 4-5 serious MMOs on the market that WoW had to compete with. The time goes by and every quarter WoW will loose some of the subs, we have couple of big MMOs coming this and next year (Wildstar, TESO, ArchAge) and World of Darkness in 2015. Also ppl are getting used to new payment models, f2p and b2p and they refuse to pay monthly fee AND paying for expansions. I expect that at the end of 2014 WoW subs will lower to like 4-5 milion(firstly it will rise due to expansion if they release it next year, but then it will fall down hard like MoP), it still will be the biggest MMO on the market.<br />
<br />
This is probably the one and only MMO that have been operating for over 8 years with subs counted in milions, event TITAN project will not get so much subs, just because the market is different now than in 2004. Blizzard did a fantastic job, maybe i hate recent expansion and i don't play WoW anymore, but the memories and nostaliga will never leave me.</div></div><hr />

ive never seen anyone on here blame anyone but activision......<br />
<br />
600,000 sub loss? thats alot of subs and im sure more will leave wow too.<br />
Im sure we will see many threads pop up from the same old idiots throwing numbers about, mentioning subs on other mmo's while pretending to be one of 'blizzards shareholding accountancy developer designer ceo's' coming up with excuses trying to justify the loss...this plagued forum seems to be full of em.<br />
<br />
'Well the sub loss is because of &lt;insert random bullshit here&gt;, things will pick up &lt;insert more random bullshit here&gt;....WELL SWTOR AND RIFT ONLY HAVE XXXK SUBS bla bla bla, WOW IS KING WOW IS KING (http://www.sheep.com/sounds/baasheep1.wav)'<br />

1.5 billion in debt for a company with a 17 billion market cap is not a big deal. 17 billion dollar market cap and year over year profits, I don't see that they have much to worry about. They'll come out of this in much better shape overall.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard publishes their own games as well. They just always let another company be over them (though I'd imagine there's reasons for that as well that likely deal with money).</div></div><hr />

Did 600,000 people leave the mmo genre? I don't mind if wow loses subs. But if those people don't join other MMO's its bad news for the genre as a whole :(<br />

Naturally some of those people will move to other mmo's. Just my 2cents.</div></div><hr />

I guess 10-man raiding, LFR, heirlooms and a ridiculously easy catch-up system isn't enough to keep people playing. Perhaps we should go back to the TBC/Wrath model, when the game was growing exponentially.<br />
<br />
Oh, the investors will not be happy about this. They will start to panic and if Blizzard has even the slightest inclination to go to a free-to-play model, subscription losses like this and the ones from last quarter will only make it seem more profitable to those greedy shareholders than sticking with the sub model. Especially when you've got companies like EA boasting about their artificially inflated number of players who flooded back to SWTOR after it went F2P.<br />
<br />
I love World of Warcraft and do not wish to see it go F2P. But, once that happens, the passion (what little left there is) will be completely gone and the death of the tried and true original MMO model will be sealed for good.</div></div><hr />

I guess 10-man raiding, LFR, heirlooms and a ridiculously easy catch-up system isn't enough to keep people playing. Perhaps we should go back to the TBC/Wrath model, when the game was growing exponentially.<br />
<br />
Oh, the investors will not be happy about this. They will start to panic and if Blizzard has even the slightest inclination to go to a free-to-play model, subscription losses like this and the ones from last quarter will only make it seem more profitable to those greedy shareholders than sticking with the sub model. Especially when you've got companies like EA boasting about their artificially inflated number of players who flooded back to SWTOR after it went F2P.<br />
<br />
I love World of Warcraft and do not wish to see it go F2P. But, once that happens, the passion (what little left there is) will be completely gone and the death of the tried and true original MMO model will be sealed for good.<br />
<br />
All the MMO's that went F2P only had about 100k or less people still playing, WoW will not be following that model for quite sometime...maybe never.</div></div><hr />

Ok, dunno where you get you data...but hardcore players are the minority and always have been. If blizz could choose to lose ALL the hardcore players but retain ALL the casual players, they would be in a much better position.</div></div><hr />

I am the same way, i dont touch any other of my characters but the monk, and i sit in SW by t he fountain across the AH waiting in 30 minutes ques for Alt Valley, only to lose get 50 honor , and do it again, i cant bring myself to run dungeons anymore or do anymore dailies , and 5.4 is bringing us the &quot;timeless isle&quot; another daily zone so we can daily while they open raid wings, i only purchase time cards now too, i cant bring myself to sub up<br />
<br />
the game is very stale now , and the carrot on the stick is shrinking while the pole on which its extended is getting longer, only to be told &quot;there's more to do&quot; , in fact there is not, they just stagger the time it takes to earn things, <br />
<br />
anyway, ill get a time card here and there, but , i am rather done playing this game , same grind, same 'meh' reward</div></div><hr />

The difference between the amount of time it took to actually get good gear is about the same amount of time as it currently takes. You just now do it in a more boring way by repeating the same shit over and over. Instead of doing a long quest chain that provides lore to the raid you are doing so you can even step inside of it, you are just doing the same quests enough times a week for tokens so you can run LFR and possibly a normal/heroic mode too if you are really trying to upgrade your gear and money for enchants and gems.</div></div><hr />

I was going to go for it, I have not been subscribed for over 6 months. (My heart lost it much longer than that... but annual pass...opps...) Turns out, I don't qualify for Scroll of Res. No benefits. No lvl 80 character on a realm with my friend. Okay... leveling... is really hard to get through, but maybe I'd give it a shot. Then comes the down payment. I'd need to buy Mists, start a new sub... maybe a 3 month chunk. That's a lot up front, for something that may not pan out into a long term renewed interest.<br />
<br />
I just want to see if there's a spark... but there's this barrier.<br />
<br />
Speaking of barriers. Until I can freely join guilds cross server, how am I going to use my main character(s) to find a suitable 25man raiding guild? That's why I quit in the first place. They have not fixed or even addressed that. I cannot freely cross servers to find a solid group of new friends. My faction / server fell apart, there's no 25man selection. Blizzard has placed a barrier between me and my goals for this game.<br />
<br />
Been so long without a fix for that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
And your proof of this is where?<br />
To begin with, your statement assumes that Hardcore players and Casual players are static.. They aren't.<br />
There are people who were hardcore five years ago and are casual now, and people who were casual a few months ago and are hardcore now.<br />
<br />
I'll tell you one thing though, casual players vastly outnumber hardcore players, and wow's current success is due to BC being more casual friendly than Vanilla, and Wrath being vastly more casual friendly than BC. If Blizzard had &quot;focused on hardcore players&quot; It's likely subs would have never even grown to 7.7 million in the first place.</div></div><hr />

That's funny because there's no dailies on Timeless Isle. If you visit MMO-Champion enough, you'd see that right on the front page.

For a lot of people it's still 5.2 content wise, I enjoyed the the former mop patches and I hope blizzard has figured out what made them good. Some will come back at 5.4 (Raid, Timeless Isle - better than barrens so it will do). Then it will go down again while the expansion is wrapping up. Expansion pre-patch, and it begins all over again, it works like that - it has a slow decline atm, can't deny that, but imo the game was awesome when they only had 5M subs so.. for me these numbers doesn't bother me at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a bit weird to see the subs so low, but over the years I've noticed that sub numbers go up or down based on whether *I* am playing. Therefore, Blizzard should work hard to earn *my* favor. Silliness aside, I do feel like something of an individual representative of the population Blizzard is trying to court, on both sides of the coin: Hardcore and Casual at the same time.<br />
<br />
The fact is that Blizzard's rise to fame came at a time when there just wasn't as much on the market. Now? Any game with a big market share better know its days are numbered, because the truth is many players just aren't invested in anything the same way. Why would we be?<br />
<br />
I'm high on my red wine so, to bore you to death (though it's part of my point), here's my current game roster: My big hours and multiplayer time are in Firefall's beta. Some nights I jump into Planetside 2 because I just love the scale of it all. I play Neverwinter (which is awful) for ~10 minutes/day because I like the professions. I occasionally play Towns (mediocre Dwarf Fortress clone on Steam) because I hate myself. When I feel ambitious I work on getting through the various Dragon Age DLC/sequels, or similar Mass Effect. I sometimes play Minecraft, Diablo 3, Monaco, Torchlight 2, Payday, Civ 5, Fallen Enchantress, and a dozen other games.<br />
<br />
My point? Why would I play WoW? How much content can Pandaria offer? I played it a bit, thought it was solid, but... why pay $15/month for it? I've been through the raiding song and dance so many times. I've geared up in heroics and PVP so many times. I've leveled so many times. I've done all this with alts so many times. I've spent hour after hour building spreadsheets to figure out some new feature, poking at EJ to see whether my numbers are right. I've done it all a thousand times (probably more like 4-6 times, considering number of xpacs): Why would I do it again?<br />
<br />
This is what every post-WoW MMO is failing at. Why do I care about doing 15/20/25/whatever-man raids? The same mechanics, the same character development, the same stories FFS.<br />
<br />
Free to play isn't the problem. Catering to casuals isn't the problem. Quality of design isn't the problem, talent changes aren't the problem, lack of change or too much change aren't the problem. It's just that Blizz can't innovate away from WoW while trying to court the population that does still enjoy it. It was always going to happen, now it's happening, BFD.<br />
<br />
Source: I am a game dev. I spend more hours reading industry post-mortems each week than most in this thread do playing WoW. I'm probably still wrong; nobody knows anything anymore and we'll never have true experts again. C'est la singularité. ;)<br />
<br />
Cheers, and long live WoW. The devs have worked hard, and it's been fun to watch usurpers try and fail, year after year. I hope I get to enjoy it a bit longer. :)</div></div><hr />

The word casual covers a very wide variety of players. Blizzard focused on a different spectrum than the one they focused on in Cata and even that of WotLK. The previous quarters main reason for sub loss was lack of engaging content for casuals which was the kind of casuals that Blizzard was focusing on in Cata. This just all the more shows that when a &quot;casual&quot; claims that their beliefs are of the majority, they are not as the group is varied and not all casuals want the same thing.<br />

My point? Why would I play WoW? How much content can Pandaria offer? I played it a bit, thought it was solid, but... why pay $15/month for it? I've been through the raiding song and dance so many times. I've geared up in heroics and PVP so many times. I've leveled so many times. I've done all this with alts so many times. I've spent hour after hour building spreadsheets to figure out some new feature, poking at EJ to see whether my numbers are right. I've done it all a thousand times (probably more like 4-6 times, considering number of xpacs): Why would I do it again?<br />
<br />
This is what every post-WoW MMO is failing at. Why do I care about doing 15/20/25/whatever-man raids? The same mechanics, the same character development, the same stories FFS.<br />
<br />
Free to play isn't the problem. Catering to casuals isn't the problem. Quality of design isn't the problem, talent changes aren't the problem, lack of change or too much change aren't the problem. It's just that Blizz can't innovate away from WoW while trying to court the population that does still enjoy it. It was always going to happen, now it's happening, BFD.<br />
<br />
Source: I am a game dev. I spend more hours reading industry post-mortems each week than most in this thread do playing WoW. I'm probably still wrong; nobody knows anything anymore and we'll never have true experts again. C'est la singularité. ;)<br />
<br />
Cheers, and long live WoW. The devs have worked hard, and it's been fun to watch usurpers try and fail, year after year. I hope I get to enjoy it a bit longer. :)<br />

Vivendi was a major stockholder in Blizzard since roughly 1998. All of WoW's development, from the very early alphas to current, have had Vivendi involved in some manner. Usually the Activision merger (~2008) is considered the point where things started to go downhill, largely in terms of more and more obvious money grabs.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you can attribute the sudden decline in WoW numbers to anything other than it finally running its natural course. There was a lot of design churn in the first few expansions, but since Cata they've basically settled on a fairly consistent way the systems work. People grow up and start families, people just flat out get bored, they want to do other things, etc.<br />
<br />
I don't think we'll see these subscriber numbers run themselves into the ground over the next 2 years, but it probably will continue to plummet down to the 4-5M range. We'll see if Flex raiding manages to prop up the ship.</div></div><hr />

TBC and Wrath had completely different models. MOP is a derivation of the Wrath model. AoE, no mana and PvP where you die from RNG burst. A big factor of the game growing in Wrath was that the Chinese WoW affiliate changed hands making it more accessible in China.</div></div><hr />

Did 600,000 people leave the mmo genre? I don't mind if wow loses subs. But if those people don't join other MMO's its bad news for the genre as a whole :(<br />
<br />
Naturally some of those people will move to other mmo's. Just my 2cents.<br />
<br />
Nope, once I left WoW 7 months ago I actually went and fired up swtor which I haven't played a year since or so and I must say, I was never happier as I actually like that mmo. Also I'm eagerly waiting the arrival of ESO atm but you may ask why am I here if I still don't play well because this expansion I just didn't find the kind of fun I used to have especially after like 5 years of playing and also since most of my friends quit I'm just waiting to see how SoO might turn out and then for the next expac then I might resub.<br />
<br />
OT; It's no longer a surprise WoW is loosing subs to me since WoW is a near 10 year old game and whoever holds 5m+ subs imo all this time truly is a great game but now, there are more MMO's and people got tired of WoW just like me or just didn't feel this expac suited them but again thats my opinion. Not sure whether the change from Acti-blizz removal from vivendi is good or not but hope it will be better on the long run for the company. I just hope atleast acti-blizz unmerge themselves and let blizz alone maybe things might fix themselves but who knows.</div></div><hr />

What frustrates me isn't that the game is losing subs, because that is to be expected in anything eventually. It's not about quality. <br />
No, what frustrates me are these endless posts claiming that wants to claim that an expansion that was current 6 years ago has a design that would work today, and increase subs. It's hilarious to be honest.</div></div><hr />

Its still the biggest MMO out there.... the game is FAR from going away. The casuals have just tapered off, They will come and go based on the ebbs and flows of the game. The Warcraft movie will bring in lots of players for a time. WoW is just returning to a more Core player base. Virtual realms / cross realms address a lot of the issues that the flexing player base has caused.</div></div><hr />

There is no incentive as there is no reward any more. That is why we played for hours, weeks, months. Now it's all epics on a silver platter as soon as you hit 60.<br />

OT: 2 bits of news released at same time and obviously damage limitation control on. This is bad news, very bad news but Wow is about to turn a corner in next few months if they have the next expansion right. As feared by many, myself included, MOP was not the right direction for the game, complete opposite actually but they have the right infrastructure and ppl on board to do a 180 and get this game back on track. But they have to eat their words and stop making the game so easy first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
honestly i wouldn't doubt thats a part of it, they are trying to be a f2p and a p2p game at the same time now, the point of a real money store with f2p games is that its the only form of revenue for them. and they don't even charge half as much for cosmetic stuff as blizzard does, take Rifts new f2p model for example, i can buy a mount on their store for 5 bucks, blizzard store what is it, 25 for a mount? and 15 bucks for a cosmetic helm? i can buy a full set of badass looking gear from head to boots on the rift store for 10 bucks. so yes, people are right to be pissed off about the cosmetic helms when blizzard makes billions a year on subscription fees. there is no reason they should charge people so much on the store other than greed.</div></div><hr />

The demise of the subscription system is inevitable with so many Free 2 Play options available. WoW will be one of many casualties.

Other factors such as demographics, financial and economical status of gamers and the country they live in, employment, social aspects etc. The world today is quite different when it was in 2004. Unemployement rates are higher and many simply cannot afford to pay for the game, others get older, get married and go on with their lives. <br />

<br />
No, just no. Seriously, there's still someone on these forums who thinks that all those &quot;subscriptions&quot;, as Activision Blizzard calls them, are people who pay 15$ a month? <br />
They aren't. A large part of that number is players in Asia that DO NOT pay the subscription you pay, and DO NOT pay expansions as you do. Which is also the reason why that number is still that high, all things considered.<br />
<br />
Subscription based MMOs are a thing of the past. Many still pay that money every single month because they feel attached to this game, and that's ok. But open your eyes: the market today offers a lot more than that. There are more high quality MMO. There are lots of MMOs who offer much more regular content updates than WoW does. Almost any recent MMO blows WoW away when it comes to graphics and animations, and some now are at least on par when it comes to art. Most deliver the storytelling in new and more varied ways. Most have a more dinamic, fast and diverse combat system. Almost every single one of them does that without asking for a subscription fee. And more high quality MMOs are coming out soon. <br />
<br />
The subscriptions cannot but go down even further. Those who say &quot;Until I enjoy it, I don't care&quot; are just delusional. The way the game is developed depends on how it fares financially. The subscriptions have a huge impact on the game you are given to play. That's quite obvious.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard had to choose some time ago if they wanted to heavily innovate WoW to stay on par with the evolution of the genre (in almost every departement: combat mechanics, 3d models, quest system, systems to deliver the story, etc.) or if they would rather keep it running as it is, just trying to adjust it on the way and milk the most out of it while developing new games in the meantime. They choose the latter, as MoP clearly showed. It was probably a very reasonable choice from their part. But lots of players made also their own choice accordingly, as the numbers show.<br />
<br />
In due time, Mists of Pandaria will be remembered as the worst expansion in WoW history, and rightly so. Sure sure, many will say that with MoP they improved on a lot of features, and that's certainly true. But a good expansion is one which doesn't just &quot;improve some things&quot; (that's the basics, really...). A good expansion is an inspiring expansion which brings a game on par with the challenges that the gaming market offers at that time in the lifecycle of a game. Pandaland wasn't inspiring and wasn't innovative enough. With a bolder inspiration and innovation, numbers would have decreased nonetheless, but not dropped in such a dramatic way. <br />
<br />
I am curious to see what Blizzard will do now. I enjoyed this game for such a long time that I still have a sincere affection for it. But the market now offers a lot at a much cheaper price. You should have a look around. The cause of this fall is not the technicalities of LFR or Heroics, I assure you. There's just much more which is offered around, and people are taking better deals.<br />
That's why people don't &quot;come back to WoW&quot; anymore, as people loved to say on this forums. Someone is offering them more for less. Adapt or decline. It's as simple as that...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palladiamors</div><div class="date">2013-07-26, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except Vivendi has always been extremely hands-off with Blizzard.

People grow up and start families, people just flat out get bored, they want to do other things, etc.<br />
<br />
I don't think we'll see these subscriber numbers run themselves into the ground over the next 2 years, but it probably will continue to plummet down to the 4-5M range. We'll see if Flex raiding manages to prop up the ship.<br />
<br />
I apologize, but if you really believe it 'ran its natural course' then you are fooling yourself. The subs didn't see a large decrease until the MASSIVE changes that rolled around in Cata. Before then the numbers went consistently up, with small dips depending on content out at the time. Then along comes Mists with even MORE changes...and what happens? An even larger drop.<br />
<br />
Natural progression would have been slow drops. Not losing a ton of subs all at once. The game was not allowed to have a natural decline, instead it had a forced one. Blizzard took a gamble, an attempt at bringing in fresh blood to avoid the eventual decline they would see. Instead what they did was shoot themselves in the foot. Then, instead of trying to FIX that, they...shot themselves again by going even further from what WoW was.<br />
<br />
This is coming from some one who started playing March after the game went live. Not everyone is going to be the same of course, but I think that considering the sheer number of losses the game is seeing that plenty of people do. Personally? I would LOVE to see Blizzard return to form. I played and loved WoW for almost seven years before Cataclysm killed my enthusiasm for the game, but I'd like nothing more for it to go back to what I used to enjoy. It probably won't, but eh, I'd still love that.</div></div><hr />

I think that the whole engine of WoW is simply outdated and no one wants to play with graphics and models from 2004. A fresh start in terms of engine would be a great idea to be able to compete with the recent MMO´s. <br />
<br />
I can still remember when I still played WoW and AION got released and I first played it. I was shocked at how much better the whole textures, models and graphics looked compared to WoW and that was in 2008 !! Now we have 2013 and there is still this shitty old engine in WoW.</div></div><hr />

I think they'll keep milking it as long as they can, even with just a million subscribers that's still a hell of a lot of income for a relatively cheap to run business with little material cost.</div></div><hr />

It's not only about Blizzard's management of the game. Other factors such as demographics, financial and economical status of gamers and the country they live in, employment, social aspects etc. The world today is quite different when it was in 2004. Unemployement rates are higher and many simply cannot afford to pay for the game, others get older, get married and go on with their lives. <br />
<br />
May be you guys should be thankful that if it wasn't for Blizzard, the game would have been dead by now and subscriber loss would have been much higher per quarter.<br />
As people &quot;move on with their lives&quot;, isn't it conspicuous that no new players are filling their places?<br />
<br />
Anybody who does start up with WoW blows through leveling, heroics, and LFR - then they have the perception that they've done everything the game has to offer, are thoroughly unimpressed, and quit - and that's just what happens with people who bother paying to get all the expansions on top of the monthly fee.<br />
<br />
WoW is losing its grip - and Blizzard is hastening its decline.<br />

People who have played since launch are out of touch with why people are complaining unless they think about it.<br />
The game is way better now than when it came out in a lot of ways - but it's gotten way worse in retaining players. <br />
By making everything super-accessible, there's absolutely no drive for anybody to improve at the game, try new things, learn more about the world, or spend time in it. <br />
<br />
The way Blizzard has it set up, any sense of community has been crushed. <br />
If new players coming into the game have the perception that they've beaten the current tier's last boss and now have to wait 3-4 months before the next one comes out, they get bored -really- fast - and drop the game; unlikely to ever return.<br />
<br />
By making a grab at the lowest common denominator, Blizzard killed the sustainability WoW kept for so long - and the subs show it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But seriously: People who talk about free to play need to gain some perpective: WOW loses more subscribers than other games (p2p or f2p) ever had and STILL has 7.7. million subscibers. More than any other. it is still by far the most successful MMO. As long as they don't drop to 1 million (a number others would kill for) there is no need to think about f2p.</div></div><hr />

I doubt I'll grind through another game the same way with the same enthusiasm as I did with World Of Warcraft. <br />
<br />
Although it's unlikely (now I have found other things to do with my hours that I would of spent playing WoW) but I can't rule out a return to see end game Panda's or the new expac. <br />
<br />
There's a lot of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; but this is not uncommon for people leaving the game after 500+days playtime since it's release.....not many games can claim that much life from a person.<br />
<br />
It's still an excellent game - The issue Blizzard has is that it's not recruiting enough new (or returning) subscribers to replace those that are leaving and it's not hard to believe that will continue at the rate it is until the new expac is released, which (as we know) will see a small boost for a quarter to two, followed by more drops.<br />
<br />
PS: 7.7million subscribers is still huge, the revenue is huge - whilst it still makes 'easy' money they will continue to patch it and expand it.</div></div><hr />

This is purely based on the fact that Activision ruined a great game like Call of Duty to make a money machine out of it, so I don't see why they would not try the same on WoW to earn as mush as possible.<br />
<br />
I wish for this game to go back to the model in TBC / WotLK something inbetween then - I don't care if not all saw every bit of content - it simply made the game feel infinite to me that I had not cleared everything. - And this feeling kept me playing. Now I feel like i have to wait a long time between each patch to get further in the game, which does not feel rewarding at all.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, there's still someone on these forums who thinks that all those &quot;subscriptions&quot;, as Activision Blizzard calls them, are people who pay 15$ a month? <br />
They aren't. A large part of that number is players in Asia that DO NOT pay the subscription you pay, and DO NOT pay expansions as you do. Which is also the reason why that number is still that high, all things considered.<br />
<br />
Subscription based MMOs are a thing of the past. Many still pay that money every single month because they feel attached to this game, and that's ok. But open your eyes: the market today offers a lot more than that. There are more high quality MMO. There are lots of MMOs who offer much more regular content updates than WoW does. Almost any recent MMO blows WoW away when it comes to graphics and animations, and some now are at least on par when it comes to art. Most deliver the storytelling in new and more varied ways. Most have a more dinamic, fast and diverse combat system. Almost every single one of them does that without asking for a subscription fee. And more high quality MMOs are coming out soon. <br />
<br />
The subscriptions cannot but go down even further. Those who say &quot;Until I enjoy it, I don't care&quot; are just delusional. The way the game is developed depends on how it fares financially. The subscriptions have a huge impact on the game you are given to play. That's quite obvious.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard had to choose some time ago if they wanted to heavily innovate WoW to stay on par with the evolution of the genre (in almost every departement: combat mechanics, 3d models, quest system, systems to deliver the story, etc.) or if they would rather keep it running as it is, just trying to adjust it on the way and milk the most out of it while developing new games in the meantime. They choose the latter, as MoP clearly showed. It was probably a very reasonable choice from their part. But lots of players made also their own choice accordingly, as the numbers show.<br />
<br />
In due time, Mists of Pandaria will be remembered as the worst expansion in WoW history, and rightly so. Sure sure, many will say that with MoP they improved on a lot of features, and that's certainly true. But a good expansion is one which doesn't just &quot;improve some things&quot; (that's the basics, really...). A good expansion is an inspiring expansion which brings a game on par with the challenges that the gaming market offers at that time in the lifecycle of a game. Pandaland wasn't inspiring and wasn't innovative enough. With a bolder inspiration and innovation, numbers would have decreased nonetheless, but not dropped in such a dramatic way. <br />
<br />
I am curious to see what Blizzard will do now. I enjoyed this game for such a long time that I still have a sincere affection for it. But the market now offers a lot at a much cheaper price. You should have a look around. The cause of this fall is not the technicalities of LFR or Heroics, I assure you. There's just much more which is offered around, and people are taking better deals.<br />
That's why people don't &quot;come back to WoW&quot; anymore, as people loved to say on this forums. Someone is offering them more for less. Adapt or decline. It's as simple as that...<br />

I just resubbed after playing other games for 7-8 months. At first I thought holy shit it is clearly to see that this is 8 years old.<br />

No, the people that come back for 5.4 will not trump the people who will quit between right NOW and the end of the quarter. There is no cycle, its a pretty steadily decreasing slope, with expansions being the only bump.<br />

At the end of the day, it's not the gameplay that is killing WoW... it's the graphics.<br />
<br />
I disagree. Dailies, lack of heroic dungeons, seeing content through LFR, lack of Normal/Heroic participation, scenarios, among half a dozen other things is why I quit WoW. Sure the game graphics aren't new, but I like how colorful WoW is. IMO gameplay trumps graphics any day, thats why some of the most popular games dont even require graphic cards. Right now I am playing Everquest 1 (private server) because I love the game despite the graphics. Same reason games like LoL are topping the charts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
7.7million subscribers is still quite a lot and who says the dropped subscriptions are all 100% genuine players like me or you? Who says that Blizzard didn't crack down on gold sellers, bots, exploited players &amp; such? Remember that Asian players do not pay the subscription fee and they were the people who bought over 60% of the subscription numbers. These players basically buy hourly time cards to play which ultimately means they clear an entire patch and then instead of paying to idle around SW/ORG they'll go and play another game instead resulting in a &quot;lost&quot; subscriber for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

You either go subscription base and your clients have acces to everything , or you are free-to-play and have microtransactions.<br />

Most of the kids I know these days would never even think of a MMO, they just like their call of duty and need for speed.. or something!

<br />
the game is very stale now , and the carrot on the stick is shrinking while the pole on which its extended is getting longer, only to be told &quot;there's more to do&quot; , in fact there is not, they just stagger the time it takes to earn things, <br />
<br />
anyway, ill get a time card here and there, but , i am rather done playing this game , same grind, same 'meh' reward<br />
<br />
This has started to be my enthusiasm for the game as well. I use to only leave the game because of moving, or financial issues. Then it started to be because the game just took too long to catch up, so I felt bored (from lack of other people doing the same things I was) and dissuaded (from the mountain of things i needed to catch up on.<br />
<br />
The end of wrath started to alleviate that (giving better ways to catch up, more varied ways to do dailies, etc.), but then it took away from another part of the game, the achievement fun ....earning something and feeling rewarded for it, and community. The end of tbc was the start of the &quot;welfare&quot; spouting crowd, but wrath definitely cemented that into place,....... while cata just kicked it while it was down.<br />
<br />
Cata brought with it the tainting of the daily quest system. The dailies were put in place to give players renewable questing at max level, questing at max level was enhanced in vanilla by converting xp to gold so that people had a method to earn money aside from mob grinding. It was never designed or intended to be used as a gating system, it was created so that the players had an enhanced way to earn money, and an avenue to enjoy the game other than farming mobs. <br />
<br />
TBC included content specific events into the daily system, but it was cosmetic (Manta ray mount, nether drakes) ...it was never progression except for a small spurt with the isle dalies which included a few rep rewards that could be useful (Gained only from doing the dalies) . Wrath touched on this as well with the crusader dailies , but aside from the sword the rewards were solely focused on cosmetic rewards and bonus rep with major cities. Cata twisted the dailies into an all new avenue for blizzard to control the player base. Much like their golden child of gating raid bosses to extend the life of the content patch, they started to require you to do dailies for months to gain a specific reward. They back-peddled on the rep gaining system in vanilla because of how tedious and unforgiving to players it was, and yet they started the system all back up again with end of wrath and cata content. Doing the Trol dailies for example, for 5 tokens or so each day, and needing close to 200 just to get the mount. All the other items required just as equally inflated numbers to get, thus making a single character grind for months to get everything.<br />
<br />
MoP evolved the grind system of old from back in vanilla, full steam ahead and bigger than ever. Simplistic and easygoing rep grinds? HA! Back to gaining it at a snails pace. Those dailies that were optional? Mandatory for progression gearing. We can still do dungeons to help out right? Wrong, get back in line and fight over those daily quest mobs for credit. When a patch comes out, itll make catching up easier right? Sure, if you do the previous content first and/or wait 2 weeks for the LFR to even open. Dont like LFR? You can still do normals on day one / hardmodes a week later, with your guild ....gated of course. Dont forget your dailies, and dont forget to cap your valor and conquests. If you miss a day or two, or forget to cap, its going to hurt you in the long run.<br />
<br />
We have so many things to do these days: daily quests, dungeons, arena, rated bgs, long quest chains, 3 forms of raiding difficulties with 2 raid size variants, crafting, achievement hunting, pet battles, rep rewards, rare spawns, outside raids, scenarios, transmog hunting, pet gathering, mount gathering, gathering gathering, tournaments, playing the AH, hanging out with the guild, hanging out with a party, hanging out with strangers, creating fan art, writing fan fiction, creating machinima videos, game blogs, podcasts, con events, conference calls with trusties, sales figures, blizzard store, ....even just sitting next to your mount on a small hill gazing into the sunset as the day turns to night.<br />
<br />
How could we not be so excited to log into the game, knowing full well all of the wondrous enjoyable things we have waiting for us to do. Just being able to pick one of those things and go with it.<br />
<br />
Oh brave new world, that has such people in it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">twilista</div><div class="date">2013-07-26, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just find it funny that all of the things that blizzard supposedly did to get me out into the world more and enjoy their content more is pretty much a joke in terms of leveling and at end game it's just become a pain in the ass. <br />
<br />
Cool I totally asked for crz to be ganked over and over and when I try to retaliate I can't get into the same crz server on my level 90. Cool I totally wanted to go out and find all the flight points in the world all over again even though I've done it 8-10 times now. The combination of the two has led me to level all my alts exclusively through lfd. Real engaging mmo play there Blizz.<br />
<br />
And at 90 I understand the concept of wanting us in the world more and all but when I find myself cursing during the day when I'm not even playing wow at the fact that have group will travel is gone or I'd rather quit playing than do another daily and try to screw ppl over of my own faction because the tagging system is old and no one wants to ever group and just wants to troll general I find myself wishing I could just sit in org all day again and that's sad. <br />
<br />
Hopefully virtual realms will help some but there's zero sense of community in this game anymore because blizzard gives us no reason to care. Want to be a trolling d bag in lfr/lfd? Go ahead you'll get a 4 hour immunity to being kicked! Want to raid current content with friends cross server? Can't do that have to pay Blizz money on top of subscription fees before you can do that. <br />
<br />
I don't even want to get started on the 4 seperate levels of raiding coming in 5.4 when the whole idea of cata was to reduce the amount of burnout because there was 4 levels of raiding. Then again one of those levels I can afk thru and get epics so guess I can't complain to much.</div></div><hr />

Now that this dramabomb is over, they can get back to making good games without some corporate tool over their shoulders.<br />
<br />
What is this? I don't even...<br />

Vivendi essentially gave them full autonomy, why wouldn't they with successes like COD, Skylanders, WoW and Diablo 3? Nothing will change, except them pocketing more money for themselves.</div></div><hr />

People did not mature, they were mature, they just got fed up with blizzard money sucking ideas and left. <br />
<br />
In every expansion there is a high peak of players to check out the content and level their toons, noone can deny that. But since panda, there has been only decline. It also tells the game has been going worse ever since and yes it had. <br />
<br />
I personally can't wait when the player base is around 1-2mil and then see how blizzard still sucks blood out of their customers. Losing players is for the good of the game. Thank you god!</div></div><hr />

Sad part now is all the threads that this little bit of news will generate. And I'm sure most people will forget that Blizzard fully expected more losses in terms of subscribers.

No. It was such a creeping gradual process, that I didn't even notice it until I created an alt for testing purposes an one of the &quot;superservers&quot;.<br />

I think the fact they cannot seem to settle on an end game format, and the incentive to actually do the end game is at such an all time low.<br />

I'd also say the predictability of the game really destroys the immersion, but that's a fault on both players and developers.</div></div><hr />

pet battles for instance: let it gain you levels, bigger teams with a arena ranking system, make it playable via app on mobile devices. <br />
transmogh: less rules, more options like colouring stuff, and more achievements that give pretty transmogh things. for instance if you have the explorer title you can get a transmogh for a offhand word map.<br />

I want them to try more on their new expansion and add more features and make more progressions paths. I really like in the 5.4 patch they go away from dailies and they give players control over their progression with the new currency (timeless coins if i remember correctly). If anyone can make a successful MMO, this is Blizzard and I want them to put their creativity to make more excited thinks and rethink many of their changes instead of throw more things to their store.</div></div><hr />

They will start to panic and if Blizzard has even the slightest inclination to go to a free-to-play model, subscription losses like this and the ones from last quarter will only make it seem more profitable to those greedy shareholders than sticking with the sub model. Especially when you've got companies like EA boasting about their artificially inflated number of players who flooded back to SWTOR after it went F2P.<br />
<br />
I love World of Warcraft and do not wish to see it go F2P. But, once that happens, the passion (what little left there is) will be completely gone and the death of the tried and true original MMO model will be sealed for good.<br />
<br />
There are F2P/B2P options that can be used that are not be. For example, F2P for normal play, $5 p/m for HC dungeons and lfr and $10 per month for the full experience. Selling XP boosts, Trasmog items, mounts, etc on a real money store. The hard core people might not like that option but even they would be silly to not understand that Blizzard needs to do something. The problem that Blizzard has is that the process will accelerate. People will leave because their friends leave because it's a social game. No one wants to run around the world if there is no one there. They already made a big mistake not consolidating servers.<br />
<br />
My daughters would probably play. They have no interest in raiding or dungeons but they would be running around in the world exploring. I will not pay $30 per month for them to play a couple of times a week. It's a waste. I can buy other games rather than do that. Getting them on board with F2P will make the world busier and can only be a good thing.</div></div><hr />

A fresh start in terms of engine would be a great idea to be able to compete with the recent MMO´s. <br />
<br />
I can still remember when I still played WoW and AION got released and I first played it. I was shocked at how much better the whole textures, models and graphics looked compared to WoW and that was in 2008 !! Now we have 2013 and there is still this shitty old engine in WoW.<br />
<br />
Graphics were proven again and again to be the least of game's problem. Just look at IOS or whatever its called and tell me with a straight face that IOS market is doomed to fail. The problem with WoW is that it tries to make everyone happy while at the same time refuses to make everyones happy by giving them excuses like &quot;not enough resources&quot;... well gee wiz blue sign.</div></div><hr />

Isn't it that Blizzards connection timeline to larger corporation is rather this:<br />
It was Vivendi to put money into Blizzard at first, to fund their ability to increase their production teams? Activision came in later.. <br />
Now if my memory is correct, this development is then rather negative, since it seems to put Blizzard even more entangled with ATVI. I wish one had more insight into the business structure behind the scenes, and the possibility of whether Blizzard had the financial ability of breaking entirely free without having to answer to any partners. <br />
<br />
Without hard data, the speculation over why the subs are lost really became a moot point. <br />
<br />
Small changes may help though to stop this somehow...<br />
The 50% valor buff... For Christs sake make this truly account wide, not just affecting toons on the same realm. It may actually help with reanimation of dead realms where still tons of currently abandoned toons exist. Finalize the system to make players able to send account wide mails cross realm. If I could send stuff to that old TBC toon I haven't played in ages anymore, I may actually play it again.. (that's an example, not a subjective demand. I have no TBC toon I haven't played in a while lol)<br />
<br />
In fact, stop the nonsense of paid character transfer. It is nowadays a nonsense. It used to be justified to pay for it, because it involved a lot more work. <br />
Nowadays it's a perfected system that ends in toons being moved in less than 15 minutes. Make realm transfers free for toons, and at the same time close high pop realms down, so they can no longer be overpopulated because everyone and their grandma wants to move there, since it's trendy to be on that realm.<br />
<br />
If there is anything on the technical part of the game I see as the most negative impact then it's this:<br />
The game is getting close to 10 years anniversary. With that said, stop the ongoing nonsense of class balancing. Stop listening to the QQ and demands of nerfing and buffing.<br />
I am a professional IRL. I do my job, and I know my craft. I have a skill set. If after almost 10 years I still do not know my skills, I am not a professional...<br />
Coming from there, after almost 10 years a constant class/spec balancing, with countless changes almost daily, is a very bad thing. That's unprofessional, that's a very bad performance. This aspect should long be a non-issue. <br />
There will never be any true balance. And there shouldn't be one. Classes and specs should be unique from one another. Not everyone needs the same tools. Not everyone needs the same abilities. So instead of tinkering with the classes and specs, tinker with the content we mastering. We have 11 classes, now if - for example - a raid has 11 bosses, and each encounter gives an edge to one of the classes, at the end of the day, all classes are treated equally, and no one can bitch about how they are treated like an unwanted step child.<br />
Why am I pointing this out? Because the majority of the players aren't geeks and nerds. They play the game for fun and leisure. They don't want to relearn their toons every few month. Playing WOW effectively requires a lot of work outside the actual game. This was always true, but it's a lot more work and study today as it was in older days.<br />
And that is a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

Also wondering a little when will the numbers start to be steddy agien as we all know they wont drop 600k subs all the time untill there is nothing left :P<br />
<br />
One more think i took note to is a small thing that i might just have missed.

There's always a decline of players at the end of each tier. Then people will comeback to run lfr normals for a few months and unsub again until the new expansion comes. Thats just standard procedure.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sliske</div><div class="date">2013-07-26, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as they don't start dropping the quality of the game (due to less numbers, this could also mean an increase in quality instead) then sub numbers don't really effect me. Sure, i feel it occasionally as 1-2 players from my guild over the past like, 2 months have quit the game. But in general i've never really felt the sub drop. People say 25 mans are dying. Statistics show that, but i've never felt it. I've always had players to run 25 mans with, my LFR queues have always been the same, etc. The only place you can 'feel' it is on already dead servers. When you have like 4 Horde to every 100 Alliance, when one of those horde quits, you feel it.<br />
<br />
All in all though, i don't see why the numbers are dropping? Burn out i guess? 5.4 looks like an amazing patch and 5.2 and 5.3 were pretty good pve wise. I can say though that the PVP in the game currently is pretty horrendous, but those PVP folks have always been pretty resilient in their ability to wait stuff out. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, if this post hadn't been made, i probably wouldn't of thought they were down to 7.7M. Probably due to the size of that 'small' number in itself. Regardless, its still almost a 50% sub drop from a few years back, even if 7.7M is 10 times the next MMO's playerbase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look we don't need to over analyse the sub drop, but let's not make silly excuses either. WoW is in sharp decline due to a number of reason stated many times before, and this has little to do with a mid tier drop off.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fkiolaris</div><div class="date">2013-07-26, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As one of the subs that left the game (again), I can offer only my personal perspective on the reasons for doing so this time. <br />
<br />
The main one by far that made me leave WoW this time is that there are many acceptable options for F2P or B2P. Not better or worse, just acceptable and much cheaper options. And these options are growing every month and become better every month.<br />
<br />
The second problem by far (for me) in the general character development systems that are simplified/streamlined too much in WoW while the competition is going the other way. I understand this is a personal taste and I accept it as such, but between the &quot;talent trees&quot; of current WoW and the soul-system of Rift or the ability-wheel of TSW (again, among others) there is a massive gap that WoW can't cover with the current settings while others can (in Rift/TSW/etc you can still pick a build that does the job and stay with it forever or keep changing as little or much as you like). I mean, it just does not feel like an RPG anymore for me while other MMOS do, for better or worse<br />
<br />
Finally, the social aspects of the game that brought me back before are becoming corroded. I am not saying that it's the game's fault, but 9 out of 10 of the people on my friends list are gone and I find some of them in those other MMOs. So when I left I was mostly playing with 1 or 2 friends and a bunch of strangers.<br />
<br />
I will probably be back for 5.4 just to raid against Garrosh, but that will be it. The amount of changes Blizzard needs to implement for my taste in order to justify paying for a sub over the numerous F2P/B2P competitors would be enough to make a new game entirely. As such, WoW is pretty much done for me with 5.4, nostalgia of all the good times be damned. I hope the game stays around for the people that still enjoy it, but I will probably be having fun elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

i think what was meant was that these figures are a month or two out of date - the sub count would only have dropped in that time. granted, not THAT much but its still troubling.</div></div><hr />

While it's clear that no game can last forever, I really think Blizzard were too passive and self-confident and the changes they've done in MoP just came too late. In the end WoW has always kept people playing because of friends, and now it's a domino effect that can't be stopped.<br />
<br />
Personally I started playing with some friends again to check out the new expansion, but really we're just waiting for the Elder Scrolls MMO.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocffca35fda3</div><div class="date">2013-07-26, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly, felt like WOTLK hit the sweet spot.<br />
<br />
Seperate raid lockouts for both 10 and 25 man meant I could raid 25 man with my guild and 10 man with friends, without having pressure to have an alt.<br />
the &quot;emblem&quot; system, gave a small advantage to the 'hardcore' raiders who could clear everything fast and in the week.<br />
<br />
I simply can not imagine a 25-man pug any more (which used to happen a lot) for any alt I had, and they were really fun to do.<br />
Wintergrasp was damn awesome. VoA was something everybody wanted, unfortunately we don't have this in MoP and I don't think the alternative in cata was widely taken to.<br />
<br />
The community has been absolutely destroyed. There was no need for LFR when 10-mans back then filled this kind of 'hole' and you had the positive of even being able to pug a 25-man and get the 'top' loot. You can only dream of that now. I'd like to say LFD was a part of this, but I also feel that due to it not being the actual end objective, it didn't really matter. Everyone PvE orientated wants to raid, not always do dungeons.<br />
<br />
Not many prestigious mounts and titles now either, people want stuff to aim for and show off.<br />
<br />
Just how I personally feel. Blizzard have taken things out their own game and failed to provide cement to then fill the holes they left. The only thing I've really been impressed with was the brawlers guild. Who honestly is really happy about quest hubs being developed? In WOTLK we had one mandatory grind and then it was over, the rest came with doing the raids.<br />
<br />
If anything it was the hardcore raiders becoming bored at the end of this and perhaps waiting until next tier or making alts. Everyone else had a lot to aim for PvE wise.</div></div><hr />

Isn't it that Blizzards connection timeline to larger corporation is rather this:<br />
It was Vivendi to put money into Blizzard at first, to fund their ability to increase their production teams? Activision came in later.. <br />
Now if my memory is correct, this development is then rather negative, since it seems to put Blizzard even more entangled with ATVI. I wish one had more insight into the business structure behind the scenes, and the possibility of whether Blizzard had the financial ability of breaking entirely free without having to answer to any partners. <br />
<br />
Without hard data, the speculation over why the subs are lost really became a moot point. <br />
<br />
Small changes may help though to stop this somehow...<br />
The 50% valor buff... For Christs sake make this truly account wide, not just affecting toons on the same realm. It may actually help with reanimation of dead realms where still tons of currently abandoned toons exist. Finalize the system to make players able to send account wide mails cross realm. If I could send stuff to that old TBC toon I haven't played in ages anymore, I may actually play it again.. (that's an example, not a subjective demand. I have no TBC toon I haven't played in a while lol)<br />
<br />
In fact, stop the nonsense of paid character transfer. It is nowadays a nonsense. It used to be justified to pay for it, because it involved a lot more work. <br />
Nowadays it's a perfected system that ends in toons being moved in less than 15 minutes. Make realm transfers free for toons, and at the same time close high pop realms down, so they can no longer be overpopulated because everyone and their grandma wants to move there, since it's trendy to be on that realm.<br />
<br /> 
If there is anything on the technical part of the game I see as the most negative impact then it's this:<br />
The game is getting close to 10 years anniversary. With that said, stop the ongoing nonsense of class balancing. Stop listening to the QQ and demands of nerfing and buffing.<br />
I am a professional IRL. I do my job, and I know my craft. I have a skill set. If after almost 10 years I still do not know my skills, I am not a professional...<br />
Coming from there, after almost 10 years a constant class/spec balancing, with countless changes almost daily, is a very bad thing. That's unprofessional, that's a very bad performance. This aspect should long be a non-issue. <br />
There will never be any true balance. And there shouldn't be one. Classes and specs should be unique from one another. Not everyone needs the same tools. Not everyone needs the same abilities. So instead of tinkering with the classes and specs, tinker with the content we mastering. We have 11 classes, now if - for example - a raid has 11 bosses, and each encounter gives an edge to one of the classes, at the end of the day, all classes are treated equally, and no one can bitch about how they are treated like an unwanted step child.<br />
Why am I pointing this out? Because the majority of the players aren't geeks and nerds. They play the game for fun and leisure. They don't want to relearn their toons every few month. Playing WOW effectively requires a lot of work outside the actual game. This was always true, but it's a lot more work and study today as it was in older days.<br />
And that is a bad thing.<br />
THIS !!<br />
But unfotunatly for as there ar still ppl in charge like Ghostcravler whu lost the conection with the game loong loong time ago .Its there lives and its them whu be unemployed soon(Devs),Diablo had Jay and we have GC but we can alwais find another thing to do :)</div></div><hr />

I always though that it was activisions bitch and that they are letting activision hold the reins. this buyout of vivendi's shares just makes it official. but form seeing the bull that the two companies are doing, running the gaming industry like a business with the only goal of making money and not also trying to make the games they make true interesting and unique sucks. I mean compared to most other games that score around 60-75 on average. activisions games only score around 45-65 on average. <br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that they only rate the success or their games based on the money it earns them not the score and a acclaim. Look at the prototype series great series that would have earned them a massive profit. but nooo. Those short sighted idiots close down radical entertainment along with the other game developing companies like Bizarre Creations and Raven Software. Developers that produces games that score around 80 mark.<br />
<br />
Sure WoW still has tons of subscribers and all, but the real question in my opinion is: When will the day that activison finally sucks blizz dry and toss it aside come? That my concern about blizz if it can't fight back at activision and establish it own independence before it's too late it's as good as dead.</div></div><hr />

The game grew too big, and too many of the people who saw it when it was small abandoned it. I genuinely think so. Now, many of the devs don't understand the underpinnings of the game that kept its players going and attracted more than it pushed away. So we're here. People leave, more people leave because their friends leave, and so on. <br />

I just wish Blizzard could buy themselves out of the merger with Activision. But seeing as World of WarCraft, their most profitable product, is steadily declining on profitability, I can't see that happenening. Then again, maybe Kotick will think that WoW's fad is over, and try to get rid of the &quot;dead weight of the company that does not make Call of Duties,&quot; and Blizzard can get themselves free once more after decades, to produce their games without &quot;guidance and suggestions from above.&quot; And that way all the silliness of trying to milk customers, with subpar products even can stop. And we can get some good old genuine Blizzard games once again. One can still hope at least :)<br />
<br />
As for WoW's decline, as I have said before: they doomed themselves the moment they decided to develop new content only for those interested in instanced content (group/raid dungeons, battlegrounds, arenas, scenarios); because it is easier, and cheaper, to develop for. Yet that way they left the vast majority of the players with no content. An open-world role-playing game with very little actual open-world role-playing content: from six main campaigns in vanilla to only two in the expansions, from almost fourty zones in vanilla to only 8(!) in the expansions, and so on. They tried to cheat their way forward, and bribe casual players with shiny rewards instead of content. It workd for some years, but even the rewards started to lose their appeal; and the players just leave. If only they kept producing as much content for each expansion as vanilla had... but &quot;ifs&quot; don't have much practical application.</div></div><hr />

the game every quarter, so, probably with a new expansion will gain some subs but, will decline more over time, the game is old, but blizzard know<br />
this cow has alot of milk, so in my thoughts game industry will have to deal with WoW for at least 3-4 more years, enough for 2 more expansions.<br />
<br />
But Blizzard will have to show their quality soon enough with good games, Titan as wow successor, will need to be a amazing game, but honestly<br />
even blizzard will get the hit on another games because wow is and eventually was so succesful.</div></div><hr />

I give it less than a year and this game will adopt something similar to Free 2 Play with a flourishing cash shop. Hell, the base for F2P shop is there now, less than a year and it will be a full cash shop.

<br />
Personally I don't mind the subscription. I actually prefer it over (kind of) free-to-play and buy-to-play, because it arms the developers with more money... in theory. What I do mind is most of that money going into the pockets of the owners of the company, not even that much into the developers' pockets; and the game left to fend on its own against all reason. The main reason WoW was so frantically successful, was its casual approach to online open-world role-playing games. When all other mmorpgs concentrated on raiding, WoW concentrated on providing a living world for players to adventure in. But with the first expansion the world got unbelievably smaller, and the focus was once more on end-game; when it was the mid-game that attracted and kept most players. Shinies instead of content worked to distract casuals for a couple of expansions, but the novelty wore off eventually, and now even more boredom has ensued. I wish they had kept putting out as much content as vanilla had with each expansion, or at least half as much. Even half would be better than what we actually got.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People say this like BioWare was ever a good developer. All their games were sub-par with an emphasis on cliche story. Any BioWare game was renown for this garbage story I found mediocre and NEVER for it's combat. You can't expect a developer to make compelling combat, which is everything an MMO is about, when they have absolutely no track record of doing so. <br />

SWTOR failed because of BioWare.</div></div><hr />

^I'd like to see a concurrent active user peak for WoW (NA &amp; EU &amp; OC) because I have a feeling it is closer to that number than 7.7 million.<br />
<br />
Could be interesting, but we are hardly seeing those numbers anytime soon...<br />
<br />
What we know is that GW2 sold something more than 3 million copies and MoP sold something more than 4 million copies (the difference to the sub number is, again, due to China, were people do not buy expansions like in EU + US). Since GW2 still didn't launch in China, the numbers are comparable.<br />
Despite what people generally think on these forums, GW2 is going quite strong, with most servers at full or high population and enough revenue coming from micro-transactions to cover for a new free content update released every 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
To be clear, I can't care less about the whole GW2 sucks / WoW sucks controversy, which is quite silly. I am just pointing to the fact that while WoW is certainly the n. 1 subcription based MMO and most likely the n. 1 overall MMO when it comes to population, when you look at the Western market, US + EU, its leadership in terms of active players at this point, in 2013, is likely to be much thinner than most people think. This basically means that in the country where you live WoW is probably still the most played MMO, but not &quot;by far&quot;.<br />
<br />
Again, this doesn't mean that one or the other games suck. They are clearly both very strong games, if you look at them without bias or fanboysm. I am just suggesting that people here make evaluations about the numbers of WoW while looking too much at WoW alone (its mechanics, its content, etc.). But now the market is much wider and stronger than it was: if you want to understand what's going on, you should adapt to look around widely, in a less WoW-centric way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think 5-7 million is the range it should settle out and Blizz can get a better grasp on developing for their player base rather than trying to develop for every player style on the planet.<br />

To be honest, I've lost most of my guild and friends from WoW and the story's just not interested me from the Alliance perspective. I'm even expecting to let my sub lapse before the next expansion for FF XIV: ARR and watching EQNext (1 week to the unveiling!).</div></div><hr />

As much as I hate to get into these debates, I have to agree. 5 years ago the number of F2P games was fairly small and nothing with serious quality behind it. Now, thats changed quite a bit, there are dozens of MMOs that can be played without ever spending a dime and the quality has come up quite a bit as well. Times are changing in the MMO world.</div></div><hr />

The graphics really show their age, and it's not worth it at all.<br />

Don't want to do that? Get rid of the old character models and put in new ones, then I'd be back and paying $15 a month.</div></div><hr />

you're already making people pay 13 euro a month<br />
but if you wanna have a ugly transmog helm you'll have to pay another 12 !<br />
or a unique mount another 20 !<br />
<br />
I've also heard or read somewhere on a website they're gonna add pay for extra xp boosts to lvl up quicker &amp; pay for more Charms of lesser good so you don't have to do dailies anymore... ( apperently this is going to be tested on the Korean servers) anyways if they do this they just anal raped their own game.</div></div><hr />

You mean the models they're working on and expected to be shown at Blizzcon as a feature for the next expansion?<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd love a $100/year subscription option</div></div><hr />
