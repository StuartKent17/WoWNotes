Lately we saw a bunch of rumors about a potential alpha test of Cataclysm starting this week and judging by the amount of mails I received, a lot of people got excited. Time to clarify a few things! <br />
<br />
First of all, the Alpha test of the expansion will not start this week and probably won't start before some time. At this point I'm not even sure if there will be a Friend and Family Alpha test, this phase of testing doesn't seem to be very important and the amount of players on the server isn't high enough to get things really tested. After a few weeks of testing you can usually connect to the server in the morning, type /who 1-80, and realize that you're the only one connected. <br />
<br />
As far as I know the latest update in the testing of Cataclysm was the introduction of a few computers with the expansion installed in the european HQ to let the employees here try the expansion, and the version they have access to is very similar to the one people played at Blizzcon. <br />
<br />
You also have to understand that each time you spread a rumor like that, thousands of accounts are hacked because scammers use that wonderful opportunity to scam people who do not understand what the F&amp;F Alpha really is. <br />
<br />
When the Alpha/Beta starts, you will know about it. Blizzard worked hard to improve their communication over the past years and I wouldn't be surprised if we heard about it through a blue post before it's leaked on a fansite. (But I'll make sure you read it on MMO-Champion first if something happens, don't worry)<br />
<br />
Stop worrying about Cataclysm and enjoy Icecrown Citadel for the moment, the next minor patch should be deployed on January 19th or January 26th. (And will include the cinematic ending the Lich King storyline)<br />
<br />
<br />
Professor Putricide Hotfixes<br />
Professor Putricide is getting two hotfixes deployed right now.<br />
<br />
One of them fixes an issue where the Mutated Transformation and Mutated Plague ability were doing significantly less damage in 25 player mode than intended. Mutated Transformation was actually doing less damage in 25 player mode than in 10 player mode!<br />
<br />
In a separate hotfix affecting both 10 and 25 player modes, Tear Gas should no longer cancel player abilities such as Devotion aura. Instead of being totally immune, players now take 99% less damage. This also means Heals over Time spells will continue to work while Tear Gased, Dispersion will grant mana, etc. <br />

Balance druids in 3.3.2<br />
Keep in mind that we tend to make much smaller adjustments during a minor patch cycle due to the limited amount of testing time we're allotted before applying such patches. For this reason you're not likely to see any major Balance druid changes coming in the next minor patch.<br />
<br />
With that being said, one small change we have in the pipeline will double the passive effectiveness of Earth and Moon so that it provides a flat 2/4/6% spell damage increase, up from 1/2/3%. As an obligatory warning, this is subject to change prior to the next minor patch going live. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418706478-why-are-balance-druids-being-ignored.html))<br />

Elemental T10 4pc Bonus<br />
We're not happy with Elemental 4PT10, even with the change Eyonix announced (not requiring Flame Shock for LvB to crit). I think we're likely to completely redo it. We'll try and post soon what we think that change will be so you can make gear choices accordingly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418856038-elemental-t10-4pc--the-good-the-bad-and.html))<br />
<br />
[...] The Shaman Tier 10 bonus has been redesigned and will no longer reduce the cooldown of Lava Burst or enable Lava Burst to be guaranteed to critical strike without Flame Shock present. Instead successful Lava Burst casts now increase the duration of Flame Shock on the target by 6 seconds.<br />
<br />
Please note this is still a work in progress and we may end up with a different or modified bonus before the patch goes live. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/22418704464-tier10-elemental-shaman-4piece-bonus.html))<br />

Using Nevermelting Ice (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50259/nevermelting-ice-crystal/) to boost Corruption's crit %<br />
I don't think either haste not crit qualify as an &quot;exploit.&quot; That word implies you are somehow abusing mechanics so bad that you risk some kind of punitive reaction on our part. Usually if we don't like how a class is working we'll just fix the mechanics and not blame players for it.<br />
<br />
In any case, haste provided a huge damage boost and was hard to fix. Crit provides a moderate damage boost and is hard to fix. So we probably won't be changing the way rolling crit works any time soon. You can use it without fear of ramifications from us.

Prot Warrior DPS<br />
We understand that warrior damage is on the low end but regarding the raid progression, it's a hard case to say that your wipe on Festergut (as an example) was caused by the difference between tank damage when the dps from focused classes like rogue, warlock, etc. can probably improve to beat the enrage timer. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/22418865857-prot-damage-is-holding-back-raid-progression.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I honestly think it's hard to argue that your choice of tank often costs you a kill because of the dps of the tank. Often those numbers are rounding errors compared to the damage capable by the dps specs in the raid. However, I don't think you even need to invoke that argument. I think it just feels crappy when your dps is lower than other tanks.<br />
<br />
I don't think the block diminishing returns exacerbates this much to be honest, but it was a problem that was already there. We'd like to buff Prot sustained dps in a way that isn't risky for PvP.<br />
<br />
(Standard: &quot;no promises&quot; implied.)<br />
<br />
I'll say again that we have nothing against threat modifiers. Some of you need to stop treating them as if they are cockroaches to be stomped out whenever they appear. Bonus threat is really the only way to keep tank damage lower than dps damage but threat higher than dps threat. It only becomes a concern when A) the threat modifiers are flat (because then when the dps do more damage with gear, you aren't doing more threat with gear) or B) you're spamming abilities that do lots of threat but no real damage, because that just feels lame (and really we're just talking Sunder Armor here, which nobody spams anymore anyways).

If I'm not mistaken this ability is used by the player who is playing the part of Abomination, so this would actually make the boss somewhat easier. I'm not saying it will be REALLY easy now, but a tiny fraction or so.</div></div><hr />

I only Flame Shock this once! , but it seems Blizzard wanted to limited the amount of Flame Shock casts from the start. You can see that based on the fact that their initial change is motivated by the thought that it's mostly the LvB crit that we're looking for. This current change however, acknowledges the fact that they miscalculated and now it brings us both the everlasting Flame Shock damage ánd the LvB crit.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if I'm missing something, but they mentioned a 6 second extension in the post and Lava Burst has an 8 second cooldown.... That doesn't sound indefinite to me.</div></div><hr />

Aye, quite correct, I got dragged away by enthousiasm :P Guess the old T10 got stuck in my head. Either way..<br />
<br />
Assuming near perfect rotation :<br />
Flame Shock	Magic<br />
18 seconds remaining<br />
<br />
Per LvB, you lose 2 seconds (lose 8, gain 6)<br />
So theoretically, you'd be able to cast 9, but more likely is 8 LvB's per Flame Shock instead of 2 (3 with the T9x2)<br />
<br />
I'd say that's a very nice gain :) Although mine was slightly exaggerated initially.</div></div><hr />

Explain to me where I went wrong please. I did wrongly calculate (by memory) the amount of LvB's per Flame Shock with or without the T9x2<br />
Flame Shock without T9x2 is 18 seconds. (2)<br />
Flame Shock with T9 x2 is 27 seconds (3)<br />

Most people would be fine with tanks do 100 dps if all tanks did 100 dps instead right now we have 1 tank doing 2k dps and other tanks do 1-2k more dps than that (3-4k) and on a fight where tank dps is huge (festergut with the tank buff) being short the 1-2k dps is harsh for the enrage timer.</div></div><hr />

Honestly I'm finding it hard to believe you have equipped all your characters with ilevel 251+ gear already, considering the shortage of frost emblems at the moment. <br />
<br />
Only thing I don't like about this patch is its almost as easy to gear up 3 characters at once to a respectable level (1 heroic a day minimum) as it is to gear up just 1 mian. As someone who only focuses on one character I'm not seeing much benefit, but alas I'm not bothered really.</div></div><hr />

I never said that. All my toons have great leveling gear - I don't see any reason to bother with icc or frost emblems besides the cloak you can buy, it's better stuff sure but it won't help me much if that patch is the last one (and even if it isn't - free frost emblems with 3.4 :P).</div></div><hr />

You won't see a major release in the summer regardless of what blizz said about accelerated releases. They just don't get the upfront sales to justify it. THey need november holiday releases to meet their 3rd or 4rth quarter results (They're a public company now) so like *EVERY* other game company they release their premier titles during that time.</div></div><hr />

If you believe that the expansion won't launch until November, that means that Beta would not start until June or July. I guarantee the Beta is not that far off. Two months away, at most, is my prediction. That puts the release at late summer, at the latest. Summer releases may not be common, but they are, by no means, non-existent. Besides, if I recall, Blizzard released an expansion in January, not typically a big release month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cataclysm is not right around the corner, but it is going to be sooner than some people think. Six months between content patches has more or less been the standard, which would put Cata in June or July.<br />
<br />
<br />
That would give us 4.0 approx in July and Cataclysm ~month+ after. I highly doubt they would ever release a expansion on summer. September-October probably.</div></div><hr />

Boub's comments in a previous news post implies he thinks that alpha/beta will start a few weeks after Patch 3.3.x launches w/ the Lich King data, which puts his predictions at early February as well. It could still come out in late summer or early fall, not necessarily holidays 2010 or even sometime in 2011 as I've seen some people predicting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I can think of at least four Blizzard games that were released in the summer: Warcraft 3, the Warcraft 3 expansion, Diablo 2, and the Diablo 2 expansion. All of those games did very well. I don't think Blizzard feels bound to release games at any particular time of the year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Every site that reported the Alpha was about to start was quoting WoW.com's report (recycled journalism), and there report was based off a Twitter feed and doctored image purposely made to trick WoW.com. Both Boub and WoWHead claim it wasn't starting this week. So really the count is 2 major sites said no, 1 major site said yes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Alpha is already happening contrary to what anyone says, it was started months ago. The public beta is what I personally am waiting for word on. I can probably put money on no Beta until at least the world first downing of Arthas.<br />
<br />
<br />
By standard definition of what an alpha phase for a product is, yes, Cataclysm has been in some form of alpha phase since at least Blizzcon. The &quot;Friends and Family Alpha&quot; that Blizzard does is technically more of a closed beta. Timing from the past two expansions has had the beta starting ~2 months after the KT/KJ died, so yeah I agree, if we're expecting Arthas in early-mid February, we should probably expect the beta in April. It still would be nice if we knew the F&amp;F Alpha was going on, for WotLK we ended up getting a lot of juicy info leaked for a couple months before the public beta started.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sapanther</div><div class="date">2010-01-13, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Time to clarify a few things! <br />
<br />
First of all, the Alpha test of the expansion will not start this week and probably won't start before some time. At this point I'm not even sure if there will be a Friend and Family Alpha test, this phase of testing doesn't seem to be very important and the amount of players on the server isn't high enough to get things really tested. After a few weeks of testing you can usually connect to the server in the morning, type /who 1-80, and realize that you're the only one connected. <br />
<br />
As far as I know the latest update in the testing of Cataclysm was the introduction of a few computers with the expansion installed in the european HQ to let the employees here try the expansion, and the version they have access to is very similar to the one people played at Blizzcon. <br />
<br />
<br />
When the Alpha/Beta starts, you will know about it. Blizzard worked hard to improve their communication over the past years and I wouldn't be surprised if we heard about it through a blue post before it's leaked on a fansite. (But I'll make sure you read it on MMO-Champion first if something happens, don't worry)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bold Italic and underlined things you MAY want to look in to. Clues Clues Clues! <br />
<br />
The first part is a hint to whats coming. <br />
<br />
The second item is some awfully detailed knowledge on the FnF scene.<br />
<br />
The third item may be a typo for there but considering #2 we may want to consider the possibility of a Freudian slip.<br />
<br />
Number four gives us the idea that maybe this isn't a fansite at all. Something to ponder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. The expansion will be this summer. The holiday season will all be about Starcraft 2.</div></div><hr />

Yes it will be patch 4.0, just like 3.0 and 2.0 were released about a month prior to their expansions. They stated at Blizzcon this would be the case.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard doubtless has a target date, but having worked in software engineering I can guarantee they don't &quot;know&quot;. Certainly not before the open beta even starts. It is unlikely but possible that the entire engine might prove unable to withstand the strain of large scale testing. That would set them back months. At this point in the development cycle they are probably pretty close to being feature complete (in other words they know what the major features will be and have the code in place for them), but they haven't done any but the most rudimentary testing. Testing on a project this size is nearly as big a job as development and much harder to plan. That's why software companies don't give release dates until the code goes &quot;gold&quot;. You never know when a huge bug might pop up and set everything back.</div></div><hr />

Prot Warrior DPS<br />
We understand that warrior damage is on the low end but regarding the raid progression, it's a hard case to say that your wipe on Festergut (as an example) was caused by the difference between tank damage when the dps from focused classes like rogue, warlock, etc. can probably improve to beat the enrage timer. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/22418865857-prot-damage-is-holding-back-raid-progression.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I honestly think it's hard to argue that your choice of tank often costs you a kill because of the dps of the tank. Often those numbers are rounding errors compared to the damage capable by the dps specs in the raid. However, I don't think you even need to invoke that argument. I think it just feels crappy when your dps is lower than other tanks.<br />
<br />
I don't think the block diminishing returns exacerbates this much to be honest, but it was a problem that was already there. We'd like to buff Prot sustained dps in a way that isn't risky for PvP.<br />
<br />
(Standard: &quot;no promises&quot; implied.)<br />
<br />
I'll say again that we have nothing against threat modifiers. Some of you need to stop treating them as if they are cockroaches to be stomped out whenever they appear. Bonus threat is really the only way to keep tank damage lower than dps damage but threat higher than dps threat. It only becomes a concern when A) the threat modifiers are flat (because then when the dps do more damage with gear, you aren't doing more threat with gear) or B) you're spamming abilities that do lots of threat but no real damage, because that just feels lame (and really we're just talking Sunder Armor here, which nobody spams anymore anyways).

Simple and very meaningful(works for talent update in cata as it makes it more &quot;interesting&quot;)<br />
<br />
Imp demo shout<br />
Same effects as current + increases the warriors damage by 10%(only works in prot so a dps warrior doesn't override), this effect is canceled if the target turns away from the warrior.<br />
or you could make it canceled if the target moves at all.<br />
<br />
does not effect pvp<br />
more interesting<br />
proper damage buff<br />
makes talent &quot;cataclysm ready&quot;<br />
scales effortlessly.</div></div><hr />

Hey Boub, get off your high horse. If it weren't for the fact that you know someone who works for Blizzard and gives you insider info you would've believed the rumor too and likely would've posted it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Oh hey random person I've never met, I have the Cata alpha, you can get it too at &quot;holyshitthisisfakeasfuck.com&quot;. &quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously, those who believe that shit without first checking Blizzard-official sites (Or even this site for christ's sake) really deserve having their accounts hacked, for being complete dumbasses.<br />
<br />
Anyway, whats this about the Lich King cinematic being released on the 19th? The plagueworks have JUST been released. We still have the Frost and Blood sections of ICC, which I doubt will be released together. If they seriously release the cinematic before the Lich King is killable...they really are stupid (Considering people will datamine that shit a half an hour after release, and plaster it all over the net).</div></div><hr />

Rumor has it that Gnomergen will be a Major City in CATALYSM!!! Any other word on this?<br />

I opened site with slow internet so only the title appeared above and had to wait another 5 minutes to see what the post was really about. I got all excited and then read the alpha won't be happening :(.<br />
I know mmo does its best to update with info, but i'm just hungering for more information, female worgen and a prediction of release date (which can be made with start of beta). <br />
Guess it's gonna be October/November after all then.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really doubt it will be in November. Just my opinion but ...<br />
<br />
1. The last major patch is 3.3 (As stated by blizzard) which hit around the end of Nov start of Dec.<br />
2. While Icecrown is gated, its release dates for each wing won't take it much further than around late Feb at most.<br />
3. By then the Beta HAS to be out or at least close too, (Im only guessing at around Late Feb early march)<br />
4. Like the last 2 expansions the major patch before game release comes out shortly around that time or slightly after. <br />
5. Game release (If nothing goes wrong) would be 3-4 months following taking you sometime to mid summer.<br />
<br />
If they waited till November 2010 (with the last MAJOR patch with any new raid or dungeon content being in Nov/Dec 09) that would be an entire year of NOTHING new at all period. I don't think members are going to stay around and play the same content with no hope of something new until Cata is released. Again this is all pure speculation on my part, but this is what I believe after thinking back on the last two expansions.</div></div><hr />

You also have to keep in mind that, while nothing is set in stone, StarCraft 2 will be releasing sometime late this year as well. Do you really think that Blizzard will want to compete with itself by releasing two HUGE games at once? I don't think that will happen...<br />

It may be beneficial in the short term for each game to release them at separate times but in the long run i don't think it will make much of a difference.</div></div><hr />
