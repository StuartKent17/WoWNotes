Yeah.. even though I personally belive that the mana return is underestimated (in pve) they really castrated this talent as of now. <br />

seriously, spec defining talent once again not worth a point, as ToW was atleast marginally better for pve, thunderstorm is just plain simple inferior to NS for pvp and if it doesnt give back like 15% mana, its not worth for pve either 51/20 without TS, anyone?</div></div><hr />

Uhh... I don't know why I would ever waste a Glyph Slot for this.

Glyph of Shield Slam: Increases your Block Value by 10% for 10 seconds after using your Shield Slam ability. (Are you kidding? This is THE mandatory tanking glyph, imo.)<br />

Glyph of Heroic Strike - You gain 10 rage when you critically strike with your Heroic Strike ability.<br />
<br />
Glyph of Revenge - After using Revenge, your next Heroic Strike costs no rage.<br />

finally, they came back to their senses, as for thunderstorm, qq, 20 yards isn't always good anyway, they just intercept and shadowstep right back to you, it's like blinking, 5 yards, on the other hand, puts them right in their deadzone, and why da fuck would you ever take ns over thunderstorm, a 3 min cd over a 45s cd, a talent that requires you to put 21 points in resto over a talent that's naturally reached, what if you wanna put more than 50 points in ele, what if you wanna put some in enhancement</div></div><hr />

Now that´s just dumb.<br />
<br />
Go back to fishbotting or whatever you were doing that suited your level of comprehension.<br />
<br />
5 yards range makes the talent loose the original function, and this was by no means anything less than NEEDED by elemental shamen to keep up. <br />
I don´t belive the decision to make this change was entirely thought through and I belive it will be altered back to a greater range and/or given other enhancing propertys later on, since this change as said before completely removes the function of the talent. <br />
They might as well remove it and build a new talent if it´s gonna stay like this.</div></div><hr />

5 yards is more than enough; if you're clever it'll put them out of melee range; if you're clever you will insta GW and be away to heal.<br />
<br />
Also saying shit like ''5 yards is nothing they can just shadowstep or intercept me as soon as i do it!'' is just stupid. If they gave you an ability that makes you avoid abilities like that; we would (and did) have a problem.<br />
<br />
Simply put 20 yards was more than double what it should be. It's an interrupt; an escape mechanism; a mana regen; and a decent AoE damage instant cast spell. Learn2p***</div></div><hr />

Glyph of Corruption - You Corruption spell has a 4% chance to cause you to enter a Shadow Trance state after damaging the opponent. The Shadow Trance state reduces the casting time of your next Shadow Bolt spell by -100%<br />

<br />
seriously though 20 was too much. 10 at maximum 8 minimum.<br />
<br />
<br />
now, what makes u think we will even be able to get to them as eleshamans? we wont have that deep enha talent, meaning we will be slowed or cced anyway on the way to casters, also, what IS the point of running into them for interrupt, when we got windshock off GCD on 6(5) s CD?<br />
<br />
tbh 20 yards was perfectly fine given its not so good pve use, as already ppl pointed out, it was like a counter to ShS, intercept, etc, ofc it can work both ways, if TS is blown before, than u are free to intercept/whatever, also, its not like eleshamans are mobile and hard to catch, right?</div></div><hr />

He was talking about Glyph of Sunder Armor. I agree with his point, not worth a spot. Even if it did really help somehow, most of my 25-man raiding job doesn't include AoE tanking, we have a paladin. Although I do like our AoE tanking changes, not to mention all changes so far.<br />

I don't deny that but please keep in mind that I'm not directly arguing about the expansion (even when there are some deep Prot talents that are completely USELESS right now) Anyway, that's the expansion and we still have time for it, so at least I still have hopes there.

<br />
I think they meant the 2nd one frostblade to be attack power. Although it should be more like 60 attack power instead of 45. Wonder if it would have made sense to find a increase your power by 30 or whatever, so you could only have one of these types of items, and whoever gets to get both spell and attack power. Maybe that would be OP, and some gear has int instead of pure strength but it would make some things easier to have just a single POWER stat.</div></div><hr />

If they are done outside combat if I already have enough mana to buff the full raid without drinking I don't care how much mana they cost.<br />
If they last 10 minutes or more especially if the buff only effects me, I don't care how long they last.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something here?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Death Knights:<br />
<br />
Dark Command now has a base 8 second cooldown (hence the CD reduction talent removal).<br />
<br />
Obliterate is now included in Death Rune Mastery (both death strike AND oblit proc DRM now that is). Runes stay in their death form until used. Theoretically you could start boss fights with 4 death and 2 blood runes D:<br />
<br />
The only skill that still receives percentage damage bonus based on the number of diseases on the target is Death Strike. All other strikes deal flat bonus damage per disease.<br />
<br />
Ghoul damage and stats were also reduced somewhat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keshiji</div><div class="date">2008-09-06, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sorry but who cares about base attack power of a prot warrior in a raid?<br />
In a raid you can expect to get some raid buffs ;).<br />
Though I think warriors are looking fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's just to set a margin, buffs are conditional and you might have them or you might not. You need to set a base to be able to compare and then add the buffs you &quot;might&quot; get.<br />
<br />
Right now the warriors base attack power is low, and even with buffs it's still low, keep in mind that's the actual situation. And those pre-expansion changes are meant for warriors when they are actually... in... the... expansion and obviously have significant AP, which once again is not the case right now. <br />
<br />
Fury is looking 'ok', so does Arms... but Prot still needs some love. Some blues said that they were going to change some things from Vigilance and I'm still waiting for that miracle to come. Shockwave is another skill that needs a revamp or some work to do, as a tank (present) I need to get hit to generate threat, because my white attacks or criticals don't generate enough rage and a stun that lasts 4 seconds... is... not... userful... and it's also very dissapointing to have such a lame 51 point skill when all others are just freaking awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, to Saberoy. I know my class very well, I've tanked every boss in the game up to Illidan (not counting SWP) and I manage to get good TPS as well. I'm quite grateful that they have repaired the bloating in the Prot tree but personally I think that's something they should've done it a lot of time ago. Also, I can't quite accept PvP talents in the deep protection tree when there are still some things that need work (Hello Vigilance, Shockwave and Safeguard!) maybe it'd be ok if I were to see them (the talents) when the expansion came out, but now I can't accept it because it'll affect my raiding experiencie directly and that's NOT COOL.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the expansion, well... we still have time and I hope to see more changes soon. But right now the &quot;hardcore&quot; raiding guilds, or rather the smart ones will just leave warrior tanks outside of their raids because they don't contribute as much as other tanks. (Sunder armor debuff can be done by any of the DPS warriors, even hunter pets are getting one... and the shouts, well... fury warriors have a stronger shouts as well, they can also use Demo shout, TC and all that stuff...) Druids tanks have a very strong constant buff to the raid, they can BR (when they stop tanking) and such, Pallies have their hands, blessings and OP auras... warrior tanks give NOTHING (unless you call the Imp. Disarm something... because... please... let's get serious, they even nerfed that thing as well... lol)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bai!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Vigilance is a cheap version of Salvation. And if you are good &quot;enough&quot; you should never need to really use it, unless the &quot;aggro&quot; lost by the target becomes your aggro, and some blues said that they wanted it to work that way... but... I'm still waiting for said change.<br />
<br />
As for shockwave... it should replace Thunderclap completely, like how Devastate replaced Sunder Armor. Less buttons and the same effect, also remvoe that nasty 20 seconds cd and the stun effect... and instead of that a daze effect or snare... but that's me.</div></div><hr />

Taking a look at the icon of those shoulders and then comparing it to the shoulder model might have given you a slight clue that the model was a placeholder, but then that requires a teeny bit of brain power to be exerted, something you are clearly incapable of.<br />

Naa kidding :p They've re-used some gear already tho, http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/september/contortion.jpg v http://thottbot.com/i23009<br />

I thought Blizzard said weeks ago they don't want locks to be cloth tanks anymore, so giving them less stamina but more defense: the teleport thing.<br />
<br />
They got the teleport but still the high stamina...<br />
<br />
<br />
because we still lifetap perhaps. remember that lifetap nerf that got pulled earlier? it will be coming in wotlk blizz has said. but that would make more stamina kinda useless again so I dont know...</div></div><hr />

Things are looking a slighty bit better on the enhancement shaman, but I still see myself as an underdog in PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

<br />
It is listed as a level 68 spell, hence you might have had trouble finding it ( took me some time before I noticed )</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I assume it's supposed to be attack power on the 45 one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On the subject on inscription, fel armor mana reduction, increase duration blessing of kings on self. I mean whats the point?<br />
<br />
They are prep spells.<br />
<br />
If they are done outside combat if I already have enough mana to buff the full raid without drinking I don't care how much mana they cost.<br />
If they last 10 minutes or more especially if the buff only effects me, I don't care how long they last.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something here?<br />
<br />
<br />
remember that there are different levels of glyphs. Those might just be cosmetic glyphs or whatever, and not available in the same slots as the good ones.</div></div><hr />

The term &quot;Base Mana&quot; refers to how much mana your character has before it is modified by Talents, Intellect, Enchants and other item effects.<br />
[/quote]<br />
<br />
that was taken directly from WoWwiki, so as i said before. Ret Pallies have a pretty tiny base mana pool, and the fact that we have no talents that affect our base mana and the new gear has no int on it, our mana pools are tiny smaller even than they are now. so you obviously don't understand base mana</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tigercat</div><div class="date">2008-09-06, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point, you morons, is that you will have more than just your base mana even if you're wearing zero gear, with no talent points spent.<br />
<br />
You gain some +mana every time you level, this is your base mana. You also often gain +intellect when you level, which is not counted into the base mana.<br />
<br />
Not a huge difference, but these people saying &quot;omg we're just gonna hav base mana&quot; are simply ignorant.</div></div><hr />

And they have been keeping the same &quot;problems&quot; in the Prot Tree for about 6-7 patches, so... what do you want me to think? Also, the blues keep saying things like &quot;Hey! we're going to fix you guys! Soon! Yeah... soon... really!&quot; and when changes come they are handy (some) but not as what a good number of tanks were expecting.<br />
<br />
I have been losing my faith in all those patches... and while they try to fix something, they break something else. :\<br />
<br />
<br />
It's the same with every class so who the. cares. According to forum posters everything will break, every single god damn small change, in TBC it was the same and now it is. There is no problem. We won't be broken.</div></div><hr />

Even so, in wrath all wars have shield slam so who needs sunder?<br />
<br />
<br />
Devestate applies the sunder effect as stated in the tooltip. My guess would be that it would still apply to that sunder armor. They just say Sunder Armor as opposed to Devestate so non prot tanks can use it too.</div></div><hr />
