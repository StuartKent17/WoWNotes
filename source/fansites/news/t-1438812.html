&lt;/div&gt; His title is the same title as Morello. I wonder if he got replaced?<br />
Nah - League's a huge game and there's a lot to do. GC's actually some MUCH-needed help on the leadership side - it's just too much for any one person to handle and make the progress I'd like to see. We'll be dividing up some of the effort on leading it, but other than making sure more things have support, the teams are pretty unchanged from who's doing want (Statikk and friends are still doing Game Health, Meddler still heads champ development, we just have more expertise to draw on now).<br />
<br />
A lot of the things we want to focus on with game health this year (and preseason is a kick-off to this effort) is primarily around fixing a lot of the old problems. After finishing up support (IE the gold item particulars + Annie problem), we want to focus on adding choice and depth by taking a HARD look at &quot;ball of stats&quot; stuff so we can actually introduce interesting stuff with trade-offs.<br />
<br />
IF he is able to make league more about playing better then the other team then just picking the more OP team then I think he can be a good asset for Riot.<br />
<br />
I am looking at this optimistically in hopes that it will make more champs viable and perhapws even breaking the ADC is a must meta to some degree.<br />
I appreciate the positive thoughts.<br />
<br />
I worked with Greg both directly and indirectly for years. He's an awesome guy who took on the impossible task of doing what Morello has done for league for so long on a game where people are incredibly invested in their character and any nerf is an extremely personal offense.<br />
<br />
It's a tough, tough job. Greg tanked it like a champion.<br />
<br />
I'm excited to see how helps bolster our ranks.<br />
&lt;/div&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;<br />
&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
A while back we asked (https://polldaddy.com/poll/7666760/?view=results) if you still wanted to see occasional Ghostcrawler Tweets and the majority did. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that he is no longer is speaking for Blizzard in these tweets.<br />
I am no longer working on WoW. You should consider any Blizzard comments I make my personal, if educated, opinions. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411970495244812288))<br />
<br />
Dev Feedback<br />
I dunno, you guys manage to sound pretty trite and curt and certain on the forums, too.<br />
We're never certain. Game design is very much a crap shoot, tempered by experience, feedback and your gut. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410100823155171328))<br />
<br />
If you left WoW because of the community I wouldn't blame you, some of the people tweeting and blaming you...<br />
No way. I was just ready to work on something else. Ultimately game developers want passionate communities! (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/417825248558333952))<br />
<br />
But most polls suggest the talent changes were liked overall, even if they weren't 100% liked. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412002930158350337))<br />
Who was polled and when? the existing community at cata launch? the lost subs between then and now? wtb better metrics<br />
Blizzard has excellent metrics overall, but are also smart enough to know when not to let metrics make the decision for them. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412008412063338496))<br />
People distrust metrics they have no ability to see. Is more transparency in some of these cases worth while?<br />
My fear was always that players would swap from giving feedback on what was fun and try to become data analysts instead. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412296197496242176))<br />
<br />
Game Design<br />
makes me also wonder who in Blizzard ever came up with the idea that grinding was fun? The reward is fun.<br />
Some players enjoy being recognized for commitment and not just raw skill. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411974432479916032))<br />
<br />
How can an evolving MMO be designed around zero grinding, zero RNG and constant meaningful rewards?<br />
Player made content maybe? (Not a WoW announcement by any stretch.) (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411971190228410368))<br />
<br />
but this is an interesting question: how to deal with frustration. Is it something devs take in account?<br />
Totally. As I said, too much frustration can make players quit. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411962033429434368))<br />
But, when rewards come too easily, that can lead to boredom, which can also make players quit. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411962163163447296))<br />
<br />
Oh, glad you pointed this out, I clicked and saw she cited me and there. Maybe some people would be surprised .<br />
I thought the 275 vs 300 food was perfect. It really let folks decide what kind of player they wanted to be. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411184057003679744))<br />
Interesting to see if player behavior changes post-itemsquish, when they're choosing between +24 and +25 food.<br />
Yes! Like that economic study that shows folks will drive across town for cheap gas but not $100 savings on a dress. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411193837285957632))<br />
<br />
So Greg, what's your thoughts on two vs. three factions in an MMO? <br />
If I was doing a new MMO (I'm not) I would have one. H vs A is good for WoW overall IMO, but is a barrier to playing with friends. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411186782458228736))<br />
<br />
I think mmo gameplay is fun because for me it taps into desire to optimize, gain much power...and be better than others.<br />
One thing I underestimated as a designer is how some players simply prefer clear power gains to interesting choices. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/422957635013320704))<br />
<br />
RNG sucked on items like trinkets, etc it will suck even more on gear. RNG != fun<br />
RNG is a challenging philosophy for designers to explain. Players typically want to minimize it, but there is risk in doing so. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411184855087464448))<br />
RNG is a challenge for players to overcome, but that sometimes gets turned into pleas to overcome it by removing it. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411185225440296960))<br />
We *think* we want to minimize it. But the other side of that hill has a lot less grass on it than we claim to see.<br />
Being able to reliably predict outcomes makes games boring. Even chess has a form of RNG in the actions of your opponent. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411194484899061760))<br />
Calling bullshit. Chess is pure strategy, no RNG at all. RNG would be if pawn takes queen had an 85% chance.<br />
Perhaps you could say games need unpredictability, which can be provided by RNG or lack of complete information. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411967600881446912))<br />
In the internet age, it's hard for games to have incomplete information (you Google everything) so RNG has grown as a tool. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411967812270186496))<br />
Back when I played Wasteland or Wizardry 6, you had to &quot;solve&quot; boss encounters and BiS lists on your own. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411968032349511680))<br />
You are conflating random behavior with strategy, which is... wrong. Very much so.<br />
Same is true of gear. &quot;Should I take this upgrade?&quot; (RNG) is more interesting than &quot;Just 3 more Immerseus kills and I'm done.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411981105693093889))<br />
What if I'm just -really- sick of Immerseus? I don't want to spend a year trying to get one item. :-\<br />
Immerseus is there regardless. Would you rather have a shot at gear or know 100% of it will be sharded? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412004788813824000))<br />
<br />
I understand the good RNG does but getting screwed by it feels REALLY bad. We don't like feeling helpless.<br />
Yeah, and we implemented some very bad luck protection systems. With millions of players, someone is going to be the 0.01% dude. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411979269158350848))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
This makes me sad. Cata heroics at launch were so much fun with friends.<br />
I agree. There was just no alternative for solo players. Maybe that problem is fixed now. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413707830202339330))<br />
<br />
I know why they wouldn't come back, but I miss the days of 2hr dngns because of the sterility.<br />
I am totally a big, long dungeon customer. But I recognize not everyone is. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411190243212013568))<br />
How did 5M end up in its current state? It went from being the most important part of the game in Classic to the least in MoP<br />
Overall, I think zerging dungeons just became more popular, which meant dungeons had a shorter lifespan overall. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411977457722343424))<br />
Not blaming players for that trend necessarily, and as I said, I like orchestrating pulls and CC personally. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411977578170171392))<br />
<br />
what happened 5 mans, used to be so many in BC/Wrath, also not very rewarding. Used to love spamming them for badges.<br />
Keeping dungeons (or any content) relevant when you start to outgear it is a big challenge for WoW. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410104220595924992))<br />
Players would exhaust them quickly. Few want to run the same dungeon 6 times a night, 2-3 nights a week. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410104084067123200))<br />
It's more scenery though than same raid instance 7 nights a week in several difficulties on several characters...<br />
Just depends on what you're into, but the WoW biz works best when players have things to do for weeks rather than come and go. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411191386147270656))<br />
<br />
the lack of new 5 man's is why I stopped playing. No &lt;60 min content for tanks. I'm not gonna drop mid raid &amp; strand a group.<br />
Adding new dungeons is challenging. Players tire of even 3 new ones in a patch pretty quickly. You need a steady drip of them. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413707551771860992))<br />
<br />
What's your stance on Challenge Modes? Did they accomplish what you guys wanted?<br />
I think they were a big success. They didn't of course scratch the itch for players who want hard but not necessarily fast. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413708103616438272))<br />
<br />
I don't know how the trend was interpreted by devs, but at times it had felt a bit like &quot;Players do X therefore X is good&quot;<br />
No, that's the Mechanar Syndrome I talk about frequently. Few were running Mech every day because it was their favorite dungeon. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412293304668012545))<br />
Personnaly, i found chain running mech more fun than dungeons zergfests we have now.<br />
Hopefully it doesn't have to be one or the other, but I agree with your statement. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412974501555499009))<br />
<br />
LFR and LFD is why WoW is doing as bad as it is right now You chew up content fast plus people no longer make friends<br />
Before LFD, many players just never ran dungeons. I think it's a myth that it forced everyone to find friends. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411973580214108160))<br />
While I agree with you Greg I wish it was more rewarding to do with friends.<br />
We were worried LFD would not catch on. We were wrong. Now we need more incentives to play with friends. Some announced at B'con. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412296476904026112))<br />
<br />
A large portion of the players on my server use it almost exclusively... getting rid of it is getting rid of them.<br />
Yeah, LFR brings a lot of benefits for sure. I'm just not sure it's enough to keep players engaged for months. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411973797449703424))<br />
<br />
Do you think LFR was better or worse for burnout? Personally I could stand 2-3 runs of a LFR vs 10-20 of a dungeon.<br />
Maybe, but that LFR might &quot;last&quot; 2-3 weeks and the dungeon 2-3 days. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410446949033054210))<br />
Because of loot cap. Real life time vs /played time. Which one should a dev be more concerned with?<br />
Ultimately whatever keeps someone playing. Folks who only run new dungeons for a week or two might not come back next time. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410503297284333568))<br />
<br />
Why isn't it? Healers and DPS have roles; why can't tanks? Let them play a tank in PvP if they want to.<br />
Other players tend to not have fun when facing a character who takes little damage and has a lot of control. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410448985111793664))<br />
Why do tanks have this much control? Control use to be DPS's job. Now all DPS do is spam buttons for big numbers.<br />
Tank control grew out of a need to keep everyone safe by controlling the mobs. I agree that it has taken away from the DPS though. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411191067396956160))<br />
<br />
Min/maxers have for too long hijacked the gearing narrative. I hope this ends the player driven madness.<br />
Sadly, it won't. You'll still see flex raids that demand heroic gear. Being labeled suboptimal is the worst of sins online. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411186535598260225))<br />
<br />
Theorycrafting for me is about understanding how the game works, not about min/maxing.<br />
I think it's useful to know a potential max target. It's unhealthy to assume that is obtainable. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411185610842316800))<br />
<br />
Items<br />
what is the design goal behind making fun items with very long cds?<br />
The idea is the &quot;fun&quot; quickly turns annoying when they are spammed. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/415644271304138752))<br />
<br />
i'm confused, does Gold have a reason to exist now or doesn't it? This is more exciting than repair bills, yet those stay?<br />
Repair has a role in the game - giving you the occasional reason to visit towns and providing a small penalty for dying. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414090185127649280))<br />
Reforging is little different from &quot;push button -&gt; get stat buff.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414090366736805888))<br />
<br />
Equipping bracers feels mandatory, why don't you remove that too?<br />
You have to actually earn the bracer by accomplishing something. Reforging is just a button. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413701182347960320))<br />
<br />
Werent you just tweeting about minmaxing only 4 a fraction of the playerbase + huge stat value difs being your prob?<br />
Yes. The idea is removing the burden of players feeling like they must do unfun things for trivial stat gains. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412975143736967168))<br />
Problem is: Your team is shit at itemizing stats for certain specs. Enhance reforges almost every part (PvP)<br />
Their goal is not to put everyone's best stats on everything.... (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413709256043425792))<br />
Because without reforging, some specs would be so bad that they would be unviable. Fix that issue, then we'll argue.<br />
We balanced around the gear that actually existed not theoretical gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413875838950449152))<br />
<br />
That comment essentially kills the desire to have alts.<br />
If you can gear your 10 alts in a reasonable time, then I gear my 2 alts instantly and get bored. How to solve? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413702613255733248))<br />
More account bound gear would help with that a lot IMO. Timeless isle was a good step.<br />
Solutions like that are nice because then you're actually playing some character instead of just having all the alts caught up. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413876815308935168))<br />
<br />
Have they considered making a tier item for all slots, but still only having 2/4 set? Might solve the breaking the set prob.<br />
Yeah I mentioned this a couple of weeks ago. You could also have different ways to complete a set, or a transferable bonus. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413701456315707392))<br />
<br />
Races<br />
Are you happy with how the Worgen turned out? I personally was disappointed with the females after the drafts seemed cool.<br />
When game art is very controversial, it's hard to call it a victory. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411969873007214593))<br />
<br />
.&quot;Slam dunk new race&quot;? (Maybe someone else can enlighten me what does that mean)<br />
The team was very excited about goblins and worgen. That level of passion doesn't (yet?) exist for say ogres and arrakoa. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411974136483688449))<br />
I always thought back in vanilla that overs would be playable before anything else, including goblins.<br />
I personally have always been a huge ogre fan. I think they're cool with a decent amount of lore. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412016381035433984))<br />
If WoW truly was my fiefdom as the forums would have you believe, the ogre, centaur and nerubian player races would be OP. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412016581061787648))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Do you think WoW could ever have room for a bard based class/spec? Blizz is the only dev I would trust to make them cool.<br />
I think it could be done. I'm not sure it's very likely. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412290045148553216))<br />
<br />
Now that youve moved on from Blizz, what truly was the design intent for Ret in pvp?<br />
I don't think it was a mystery. They have a lot of utility and some ability to heal in a pinch but at the cost of mobility. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411978025333301248))<br />
<br />
mostly you say how in pve it will be/it is. i feel like you still dont care about pvp at all<br />
Most players want spec diversity in PvE. In PvP more of a mixed bag - some players are happy with few but balanced spec options. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410105387472277504))<br />
<br />
So now that you're out, I have just one question...Arms. Why?<br />
We nerfed Arms too hard trying to solve the early Shockwave + TfB problems. We buffed them in 5.4, but it was too much. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413705132509913089))<br />
TfB was flat out bad design. Lazy. It was a slap in the face. All of the tropes, because it could 1 hit. F that.<br />
Our thought was that very rare occurrences don't have much balance impact because they are so rare. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413877410728140801))<br />
im assuming that that has changed inthe devs minds, considering the backlash from community over tfb<br />
Yeah I admitted that in a second tweet on that subject. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414091895510290432))<br />
<br />
and, why has it persisted as a pve stepchild for so long, especially when fury can do it all too?<br />
But overall the design goal for &quot;Why have multiple DPS (or healer) specs in one class?&quot; has proven difficult to answer. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413878704863838209))<br />
Maybe WoW would be better if rogues had 1 spec, warriors had 2 and so on. Shrug. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413878846627139585))<br />
I don't follow.<br />
Maybe warrior should be Fury and Prot (no Arms). Maybe hunter should be Hunter (no MM, BM or SV). (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414089546834264064))<br />
We always struggled to define reasons for players to play both warrior DPS specs or all 3 mage specs, etc. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414089691311267840))<br />
<br />
I'm a believer that content should follow lore. But new classes are fine. I'm trying to think of a new class that isnt dumb<br />
I feel there is a lot of untapped class design space. D&amp;D, Pathfinder etc. still come out with clever new ideas. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413703647264927745))<br />
<br />
i'm on the side of stopping wow being dumbed down personally<br />
Based on your previous tweet, do you feel like removing mandatory choices is dumbing down? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413699145979805696))<br />
Because that is an argument I hear. Knowing that DK = Strength may not be a choice, but it is something you have to learn. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413699437047717889))<br />
I also wonder how much of the &quot;dumbing down&quot; discussion is because players themselves are much more sophisticated now. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413699602328465408))<br />
In BC, folks wondered if an item or talent was good. Now that knowledge is readily available in seconds to most of us. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413699818490306562))<br />
<br />
How do you personally feel about the new talents? Did it resolve issues from the old one? Did it present any new issues?<br />
Overall, I vastly prefer the new model, as a designer and player. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412008603000651776))<br />
Old issues: Things like respecing at key levels to get gold medal talents you were expected to have. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412011798259179520))<br />
Old issues: &quot;Your X has a 20/40/60/80/100% to cause Y, and BTW it's crippling if Y doesn't happen so you better spend 5 points.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412012177629786112))<br />
Old issues: designers always moving powerful talents deeper in trees to stop players from getting broken &quot;hybrid&quot; builds. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412012333175541760))<br />
New issues: Not every spec gets a true choice at every tier yet. That feels possible to design though. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412012773556502528))<br />
New issues: Some players just like more choices, even if the choice is an illusion, or can't actually be designed. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412012633525452800))<br />
<br />
Past<br />
now that u have left? Do you think theyll ever update silvermoon to flyable? Or is it a NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN situation?<br />
I doubt it will ever happen. The time investment is just too great. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412976862218838017))<br />
I don't get how a zone in the xpak that introduced flying was designed unflyable...<br />
Those buildings in Silvermoon aren't there. They are all ugly facades like a Hollywood backlot. And even that SM took months. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413705899304177664))<br />
<br />
Just how complicated was it to make the capitals flying friendly ?<br />
Very. The original cities were all fake. There were several SW Cathedrals, and the castle was kind of a skybox. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413704092746145792))<br />
Buildings in WoW are hand-crafted by dungeon artists, and cities have a lot of buildings. It took months. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413704270249091072))<br />
Blizzard employs X artists. If some of those work on Silvermoon, then something else isn't going to get made. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413704406467502080))<br />
Even hiring more artists still makes the choice between working on something old or something new. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413704502915518465))<br />
<br />
I feel Blizz did the Cata revamp in a wrong way, and now will be afraid of any revamps. <br />
What would you consider the right way? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413708692828061696))<br />
Restructure 1-60 quests without altering timeline of those quests. Phase Azeroth zones for level 80+ players.<br />
Isn't that twice as much quest content though if we had to make 2 versions of say Badlands? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413875326670737408))<br />
There was some hope that BC and LK could be updated as well, and maybe that can still happen some day. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413875581235638272))<br />
We caught 1-60 up to &quot;modern&quot; time so that Deathwing and the Cataclysm could be front and center. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413875486826053632))<br />
The revamp was nice and needed, the problem was that Blizzard tried to swallow more than it could chew.<br />
Doesn't Blizzard always? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/414091444115099648))<br />
<br />
Why was Path of the Titan scrapped and will they ever introduce it?<br />
It wasn't in a good enough state yet. I still like the idea of power progression that isn't related to gear or character levels. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413710982393774080))<br />
<br />
Why was there never again an event like the Ahn'Qiraj gate opening and quest line?Were there ever plans to do smth similar?<br />
Concept was cool. Reality was grinding linen and Silithus lag. I'd love to see the team try again knowing what they know now. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411187817654390784))<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Can you clarify this? A few months ago you said the WoW team was getting bigger which would result in more freq content, yes?<br />
The team has grown with the hope of delivering content faster. It has taken time, and they aren't quite there yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411962547030335488))<br />
<br />
but I think MMO devs should aim to inspire. it's not always about the outcome, but adventure.<br />
I agree, and it's easy to get caught up in mechanic and number tuning and not the grand adventure that it is supposed to be. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412298164356411392))<br />
<br />
I think the biggest thing that explains WoW sub losses is the diversity in the mmo market now. I think tmmos are more niche.<br />
Is that true though? My prediction (sans data) is that fewer players are playing any MMO today relative to say 5 years ago. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412003656767008769))<br />
<br />
Greg, record subs in Wrath. All since then has been dumbing down, making the game easier. Subs now 1/2 max. Why?<br />
I tend to think because the game is 10 years old and not exactly easy to get back into, esp. if your friends move on. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411979473869737984))<br />
I really don't think it has much to do with game features or direction at all, but that is my opinion and not a Blizzard statement (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411979648851902464))<br />
<br />
24% of customers left under and he &quot;quit&quot; on his own <br />
WoW was never &quot;under&quot; me, so I wouldn't be the right person to can. Personally, I would get my facts straight before I trolled. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/410103153665658880))<br />
<br />
Why did MoP do nothing but bleed subscribers throughout its life cycle? Besides the game being old.<br />
I say this frequently, but players vastly overestimate the degree to which design changes cause sub loss. Vastly. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412015585040408576))<br />
The guy who quits because his work schedule changes tends to not broadcast that fact. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412016208553062400))<br />
The rage quits so often cited on forums seem more common than they are because they're on forums. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412016119369592832))<br />
It's more likely to be an issue when a player returning after 2-3 years can't recognize the game any longer and leaves again. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412015795376365568))<br />
Number of players coming and going has always been fairly high. Fewer new players are trying the game these days. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412015423979130880))<br />
<br />
Was driven by YOU saying so. Be4 that players didn't remotely consider change velocity when proposing/complaining abt changes<br />
Pretty sure I've never said that specific changes cause a lot of players to quit. Too much change overall can and does. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412298000711446528))<br />
coming back after 2 years, I'm surprised at the faction change rate for the top Alliance guildsAlli needs buffs<br />
My opinion is that Horde racials are too raid friendly, but my opinion doesn't count for much. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/413702981947625472))<br />
<br />
But those who have lapsed may have done so because the game was getting boring and wasn't changing enough.<br />
Yeah, like I said, that may cause current players to lapse. But too much change can make it hard for others to return. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/417426023190233088))<br />
<br />
I dont get that. I've been here since 04 and quit and came back more times than I can count. Ive never been lost due to it =\<br />
Would be awesome if more players were like you, but we also know many do come back and quit again quickly because they feel lost. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412295876279689216))<br />
<br />
End of WoW for me was watching my server die and Blizzard doing nothing to resolve the problem.<br />
What do you think they should have done? Free moves have limited effect and forced moves are very unpopular. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412003911013105664))<br />
Should combine servers and if people cant get the name they want, well that sucks but itd be the price to pay. Just IMO<br />
As I've said, WoW gets a lot of returning players. It's not a great experience when you can't find your friends or guild or name. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412295358509625344))<br />
<br />
MoP has done a lot of damage to WoW. Lot of those people that have left will not be back.<br />
You seem to be linking business data with an opinion on content, which is tenuous. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411191656570822656))<br />
it's also an accurate representation of how content is perceived by the community.<br />
Now both can be subjectively right, but how does that become a measurement of community views? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/411969561768898560))<br />
you once said fallout from talent changes was anticipated. Too many choices like that slowly ate away at subs over years.<br />
The conclusion from your tweet seems to be that no design should be changed ever because someone won't like it and might quit. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412003065185595392))<br />
No sir, not at all. But there should be a better reason than &quot;someone complained on forums&quot; Wrath/BC were very good models<br />
Blizzard would never radically change a design because of just a few isolated complaints. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412008172535029762))<br />
I didn't think so, but that's often the official explination. &quot;this was too complicated, so we're changing/removing X&quot;.<br />
There is complication because something is confusing for new players, which is legit, but understandable that vets don't agree. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412013453872615424))<br />
early wrath, I tanked in fury once. I enjoyed experimenting with talents even if it wasn't &quot;optimal&quot; for patchrk situations<br />
The game supports a fair amount of that, but whether fellow players tolerate it is a different story. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/412298592880050176))</div></div><hr />

Riot is the right place for someone like him. I think Ghostcrawler has good ideas on paper, but they didn't necessarily translate well to WoW. I didn't like him being one of the leads on WoW because for me, he didn't have the passion for Warcraft as a universe and didn't take it into consideration when working on new systems/balancing things out and that means the game losing flavor. LoL is a much &quot;simpler&quot; game and you really can focus on balancing and streamlining things out without much consequence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Game companies don't necessarily hire people who have made the exact same game before. The whole point of hiring new people is to get new ideas and broaden your vision of your own product. Ghostcrawler is a very clever guy with a lot of experience and communication skills.</div></div><hr />

Always had a lot of time for Greg, but Blizzard seem perennially unable to admit they made mistakes, huge game design mistakes resulting in the mess we have now. Does not bode well for the future. I expected something massive during Blizzcon, showing they were in control of the game and able to put it back on course. Let's see what happens next but they are losing my interest rapidly. I wish this was not the case.<br />
<br />
Also what happened to warcraft realms? You can no longer view activity graphs and this has been the case for months - I smell a rat.</div></div><hr />

I never said anything about an MMO. Riot could make literally any genre of game. Just have it in the LoL universe and people will buy/play it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We were worried LFD would not catch on. We were wrong. Now we need more incentives to play with friends. Some announced at B'con. <br />
<br />
<br />
It took them three years to figure that out? And the solution is to basically reverse the &quot;Luck of the Draw&quot; buff which is not some creative idea. No, that is something a random player can come up with.<br />
That buff should also have been removed with MoP when they made 5 mans easier than EVER BEFORE. There is no need at all to buff random groups for such dungeons.<br />
I believe this has also been posted as feedback on the forums multiple times. Like many other small things they should have fixed long ago. And telling your customers over and over that even the smallest patches are a lot of work and hard to properly implement is not a good excuse, especially for a huge company with so much experience (9 years of WoW...) like Blizzard. I absolutely have no mercy for Blizzard for some of these very stupid mistakes they made over the years with WoW. Greg Street probably makes five times what I make a year and this is what he has to say? God.<br />

What I can tell you is that 3 years later, Ghostcrawler &quot;Greg Street&quot; is nothing but a myth. It's been long since he's gone from LoL, that even old LoL players forgot about him. However, LoL is no more though as what it was today, it has been turned into a more chaotic version of itself than it is now. The game is in such a state of no return and Heroes of the Storm is now the leader of all MOBA's along with Dota. Meanwhile Greg Street, no longer holding the name &quot;Ghostcrawler&quot; has finally found a job suiting his degree. <br />

Its funny how he leaves for a game that is clearly catered towards 12y olds with the attention span of one and completely watered down game mechanics so they be able to understand the game.<br />
Darn, i might actually resub for the next WoW expansion just because he left, maybe Blizzard start designing content for mature players instead of kids again!</div></div><hr />

Riot Games is not a small company in comparison to Blizzard, especially with how many designers they churn through and hire on what seems to be a monthly basis. I doubt Greg Street moved from Blizzard to Riot Games for a smaller company experience. Seems like the shittiest choice for him if so.</div></div><hr />

I didn't like him being one of the leads on WoW because for me, he didn't have the passion for Warcraft as a universe and didn't take it into consideration when working on new systems/balancing things out and that means the game losing flavor. LoL is a much &quot;simpler&quot; game and you really can focus on balancing and streamlining things out without much consequence.<br />
<br />
Agreed :) I wouldn't go so far as some of the idiots *why is a marine biologist making games derp* but he didn't seem to be as involved with the WoW UNIVERSE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TBC - arena had a massive following, participation was 10x what it is now and arena was in fact an eSport. Intel extreme master, MLG, EG/Dignitas sponsors ect ect ect. Hard to compare it to newer expansions because part of the fun was everybody was so bad, the difference between 1500 players and 2.7k players was huge (unlike Cata/MoP), so you if you were good you had room to outplay someone and win. <br />
<br />
Wrath - was more of the same, participation dropped, but WoW remained a strong eSport with a huge PvP community. The game was still largely skill-based with reactionary mechanics such as charge/nova jumping, vanish immuning, complex (sorta) talent trees that were customizable to suit the person playstyle, no hybrid healing which lead to an unforgiving but competitive experience. The vast majority of top and ex-top players agree 3.3.5 was the best state the game has ever been in. It wasn't balanced by any stretch, but the core mechanics of the game, such as offensive/defensive dispelling meta game were nearly perfect for what a game like WoW needs to be competitive. Strategy. <br />
<br />
Cata - Game dropped from every competitive group, 3 illegitimate arena seasons due to incompetence from devs over MMR, arena-match history removed so players can't make community based 'decisions', skirmishes removed, awful mechanics, skill-based mechanics removed. Haste levels dropped and the rise of instant cast abilities (CC), pace of the game slowed down but not in a good way. Vial of shadows/cunning left in the game for a month and ruined S11, trinkets that one-shot people, rogue legendary worse than shadowmourne by far.<br />
<br />
MoP - Further dumbing down of class mechanics, passive abilities incorporated into multiple spells. Overhaul of talent trees (initial reaction was good), but we now realize they are even more cookie-cutter than ever and completely uncustomizable compared to old trees. Awful mechanics, AI pets become MvPs, abilities implemented blindly because they are fun, psyfiend, stampede, warriors and hunters 1 shotting people from 2 months in S12, MMR not reset and treant stun in S13, S14 titles devalued slightly better than past two seasons but the game is still in an awful state.<br />
<br />
I havn't done PvE since the first week of Cata where I just decided it was terrible. <br />
<br />
But doesn't it seem slightly odd they'd recruit him from a game that had its PvP scene completely die due to minor developmental decisions?<br />
<br />
People are talking about raids, but what does PvE balance, where you could give everyone 3 buttons that all do the same thing and it'd probably be just as fun, have to do with a game like League? Whether ToC looked nice or not is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
The truth is the core gameplay mechanics have this game have just dropped through the floor since Wrath. PvE and PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the &quot;You don't know how good you have it until it's gone&quot; applies heavily for time dedicated games; which WoW was. Not so much anymore, from my perspective. And people probably enjoyed the game through nostalgia or true grievance of missing the past titles. I don't know exactly of course, but there certainly were much better mechanics from the past that have been removed.</div></div><hr />

Ulduar has to be the best raid ever made.<br />
<br />
The flexibility in deciding which boss to fight and the mechanic in enabling hard mode were also a great bonus to an already perfect raid.</div></div><hr />

12 million players will always be my reference point for that. It has nothing to do with nostalgia at all... if that was the case I would completely stoked for the new expansion... and I'm not. Not at all.<br />
<br />
You can make the argument that number was carry over from TBC... but WotLK still grew that carry over number from 10 to 12 million.<br />

Every expansion since then has only lost more and more subscribers.</div></div><hr />

It's fine if it's not a competitive part of the game or a competitive game (like PVP, or LoL), but balancing a competitive game around new players is terrible design, especially if you throw all your money into esports for such a game (Riot). I will never take competitive LoL seriously because of this.</div></div><hr />

kinda hard to do, I played heroes and I play lol. Heroes as it is now is VERY different from LoL. While having a bit of experience is good, you pretty much have to throw what you know about that kinda game out the window for Heroes, they pretty much rebuilt the genre from the ground up for that game.</div></div><hr />

While LoL likely holds a greater retention than an average MMO, they still need new players in order to expand the game. To think that even a handful of isolated balance passes will somehow upset the entire structure of their revenue generating e-sport competition is fairly naïve. The people playing at the level to worry about this likely play many, many characters at the highest level possible. It might change comps immediately, but that is a part of playing these things. 21 This is also ignoring the fact that Morello continues on to say that they will monitor that Champs performance at high level play to make sure it doesn't cause large problems. Now, they might not back up their words with appropriate actions...I don't follow LoL intently so I can't say from personal experience. However, in theory his explanation is exactly right. The people commenting on this act like a) they are pro players b) there aren't a bajillion other heroes and c) that they aren't going to care what the effects are at high level, even though he specifically stated otherwise. 21If anyone has a problem with balances like this, they should also be completely against ever adding new heroes or changing the game ever for the same reasons. We all know how illogical that is, so I'm not sure why people think they have weight on this issue. They don't.</div></div><hr />

LoL does not have 30-60 million active players. They have 60 million total accounts, which is from a FREE game where anyone can sign up, and multiple times.<br />
<br />
LoL has an active monthly playerbase of roughly ~10 million, whereas WoW is at roughly ~7 million.<br />
<br />
Riot does not even put a dent in (Activision/)Blizzard's total revenue.<br />
<br />
This being said, I absolutely love both games/companies and play them both regularly, but if you're going to be a fanboi and support company A, at least use proper stats.<br />

Its not even close which game is played more.<br />

Of course Riot doesn't make more money than Acti/Blizzard, especially seeing how Riot has 1 game and Blizz has several. You can bet all the rupees you have though that League makes a lot more than WoW does and they will only make more.<br />

Please Mmo-champ, make DAMNED SURE you clarify who's saying what from now on. I'm not interested in GC sayings about WoW now that he's no longer speaking for the game. I liked him, but WoW comes first and I am not interested in the OPINION of someone. We get enough of that crap from the playerbase.

<br />
Its not even close which game is played more.<br />
<br />
Of course Riot doesn't make more money than Acti/Blizzard, especially seeing how Riot has 1 game and Blizz has several. You can bet all the rupees you have though that League makes a lot more than WoW does and they will only make more.<br />
<br />
You are HIGHLY misinformed... 10 million monthly users, lulz.<br />
<br />
Those charts have been out for what a year now? And even when they first came out I called bullshit, they arent like quarterly reports that Blizzard do, this is a nicely framed marketing picture that they can skew in whatever direction they want. Smurfs for example would be represented on this, and in my experience, every single LoL player I know has a minimum of one smurf. Thats probably 50+ players.<br />
<br />
You can also look at the stats for males or degrees and think &quot;where are they getting this info from?&quot;, chances are its from the small % of people willing to actually do the surveys they send out, ie the true fans.<br />
<br />
I dont mind the game but the company is absolutely despisable, both in their business practises and their employees (im looking at you pendragon). The fact they still charge rediculous RP prices for fun skins and refuse to find a stable server for EUW (for example) is testament to this. <br />
<br />
The IP is even more incredible, its not a P2W game, but it might as well be when you cant unlock all the heroes and runes without playing thousands of games, this is a game design direction I despise wholey in a dota style game. Which is where Ghostcrawler can redeem himself.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard HAS to have quarterly reports because they are publically traded lol. Riot releases stats , official stats. I believe them. I dunno why you wouldn't. Riot is known to be one of the best and most stand up developers in the industry. I dunno what all the hate is about.<br />
<br />
From reading your post, you have issues with them personally... doesn't make them a bad company though.<br />
<br />
League is no where close to a P2W game lol. Buying a champ doesnt assure you victories. Please go find me a champion that has an extremely high win rate. You cant. <br />
<br />
Your issue is not with league, but the DOTA / MOBA genre in general.</div></div><hr />

At first, I thought it was because he was tired of working on WoW, which is understandable. But Blizz couldve had him working on another game of theirs instead. Maybe GC just wanted new bosses, new people to work with. Or Maybe he sees Blizz as a dead end. They haven't developed a new IP in years. Titan is in developer hell. Blizz is more focused on their established IP's and perhaps GC just got bored. Who knows?</div></div><hr />

Much as I never really got into the Moba scene, I too have played plenty of LoL games for and never spent a penny. My summoner is only lvl 20 or 21 or something but still. The advantage of those extra 10 masteries isn't that obvious really. The game is not pay-to-win.</div></div><hr />

@ Comment number one, LoLs model is to get people to buy heroes and skins<br />
<br />
Dotas is to get people to buy skins<br />
<br />
Yes, so different indeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
@ Comment number 2<br />
<br />
Have you unlocked every heroes and if so how long did it take ? If not my point is proven.<br />
<br />
Its a competitive game where you have to unlock core parts of the game, which is retarded</div></div><hr />

Theres nothing subjective about that rundown, you dont have a choice! If you want balanced matchmaking you need to have every hero avaliable with corresponding rune pages. Other companies providing better services is not irrelevant, how can it be? This is a competitive industry and the market is being saturated with Dota style games, if Riot neglect progress for profits how is that a positive. <br />
<br />
I never said it was a travesty now your just twisting my words, I said their business practises are pathetic you can disagree with that and praise them all you want, but dont you dare tell me im entitled, ive already payed that games worth in skins or heroes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flower Milk</div><div class="date">2014-01-14, 06:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's actually not and here's why: LoL, much like any game, exists on a constant churn of players. While LoL likely holds a greater retention than an average MMO, they still need new players in order to expand the game. To think that even a handful of isolated balance passes will somehow upset the entire structure of their revenue generating e-sport competition is fairly naïve. The people playing at the level to worry about this likely play many, many characters at the highest level possible. It might change comps immediately, but that is a part of playing these things. 21 This is also ignoring the fact that Morello continues on to say that they will monitor that Champs performance at high level play to make sure it doesn't cause large problems. Now, they might not back up their words with appropriate actions...I don't follow LoL intently so I can't say from personal experience. However, in theory his explanation is exactly right. The people commenting on this act like a) they are pro players b) there aren't a bajillion other heroes and c) that they aren't going to care what the effects are at high level, even though he specifically stated otherwise. 21If anyone has a problem with balances like this, they should also be completely against ever adding new heroes or changing the game ever for the same reasons. We all know how illogical that is, so I'm not sure why people think they have weight on this issue. They don't.<br />
<br />
LoL got big due to them investing a lot of their money into esports though. If you really think they would have got to where they are today without esports, you are kidding yourself. Balancing a competitive game that does well because of esports around all levels of play is a stupid idea. You are basically rewarding people for not knowing how to play the game, there is no pay off to continue to play the game and get better. The only motivation to keep playing League is to earn more points to unlock more heroes so you can play the most OP hero at the time for competitive play.<br />
<br />
That is why I stopped playing League and switched to Dota 2.</div></div><hr />

I played in the beta, it certainly wasn't as big then as it is now. As soon as they started throwing money at their esports scene and holding tournaments is pretty much when the game exploded. People watched pro players streaming, they watched tournaments, and the game became much bigger than it was before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i will agree with you, graphs and numbers released from any company are going to be skewered to make them look better. its only natural.<br />
<br />
but to play devils advocate, how many of blizzards 7+ million subs are unique subs? how many out of that 7 million are simply duplicates from people who buy a second account? i personally knew of several people in my guild back in TBC days that bought a second account and kept both of them active at the same time. what about the people who multi-box? while the population who do is, im sure, really really low the fact remains there are numerous people out there who own multiple accounts.<br />
<br />
isnt there a guy who used to multi box like a full 40 man AV premade? again the population of people who do things like that are probably in the minority but thats proof that the 7 million sub number is a little misleading.</div></div><hr />

Riot is the right place for someone like him. I think Ghostcrawler has good ideas on paper, but they didn't necessarily translate well to WoW. I didn't like him being one of the leads on WoW because for me, he didn't have the passion for Warcraft as a universe and didn't take it into consideration when working on new systems/balancing things out and that means the game losing flavor. LoL is a much &quot;simpler&quot; game and you really can focus on balancing and streamlining things out without much consequence.<br />
<br />
Yet the Q&amp;A posted by the OP shows Greg saying that people get too wrapped up in the numbers game/tuning and forget about the actual &quot;adventure&quot; of the game. Everyone blames him for all these terrible decision that &quot;he made&quot; for class balance, etc. but like he's stated many times before, it's a collective effort, I highly doubt he just feel like doing something and make it happen in game. A lot of decisions are made out of necessity, imagine if DK's were still Wrath level...</div></div><hr />

You really shouldn't call anyone dumb when you don't even know who was and still is in charge of WoW development. It was never GC. Do yourself a favor and find out who the hell Tom Chilton is before you speak on things you know nothing about.</div></div><hr />

So you don't play LoL, but you've checked out its twitch channel? Right.<br />

I was pretty impressed with the patience GC showed answering these tweets from people who don't seem to realize he doesn't work for Blizzard anymore. I would've been verbally backhanding the douchebags left and right, now that he no longer necessarily has to play nice with ignorant children.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-all AP mage attacks buffed 100%<br />
<br />
-melee champions have been removed from the game<br />
<br />
-the meta will be as follows: 3 ranged dps, 1 tank, 1 adc. deviating from this will result in a permanent ban.<br />
<br />
-garen has been nerfed due to similarities to paladins.<br />
<br />
-all champion auras have been consolidated into one buff, bring the player not the class.<br />
<br />
-item shop has been removed, instead you can find random weapons/items on the map to collect.<br />

Hmm, lead game designer at the top of the industry to...... some b-grade developer.<br />
&quot;Interesting&quot; career move, just confirms for me that he didn't leave blizzard freely, but got fired....<br />

More like...lead systems designer at Blizzard to lead game designer at Riot. Chilton is WoW's lead game designer.<br />

Why do people instantly assume he's working on LoL? Riot have more than enough money to be working on new projects.<br />
<br />
You are coming to a fansite for an online video game and expecting mature, real-world conversations? About 10 people have already used the word ´hate´ to describe their feelings about a man they never met who they think was all-responsible for nerfing their spec... and so he deserves hate. I enjoy playing WOW, but you have to understand if you come to a fansite forum, you are mostly going to hear from 13 year old boys who probably have $15/month as the only thing they have ever paid for, so they think they are king.<br />
<br />
Don´t try to have any type of intelligent discussion about anything real-world.. becasuse most of the people here don´t have any yet.<br />

<br />
a) They work as a team<br />
b) WoW is a better game than ever. If you don't enjoy it anymore, it's your own fault. Not that you can change anything, it's just how it is. I enjoy it 25% of what I used to when my interest had peaked, still I admit that gameplay mechanics have improved. I was never that into Pandaland-lore, but the civil war was interesting, so I can't really see how the game has declined in any way but just being old and maybe soon outplayed. I'll admit being wrong when vanilla pirate servers has millions of happy players and a thriving community. <br />

It's free, very low settings, and heavily casual so everyone can play. I don't think anything will ever beat good ol LoL. It's such a fun genre and they managed to make a game that casuals can play on any computer, damn good company.<br />

LoL is the biggest online game there is right now, so it was the most logical step for him to go there. <br />
<br />
WoW has less than 10 mio players, LoL has 32 mio people playing per month. LoL has an online league with hundred thousands of ppl watching the weekly games on twitch - in Korea they're also broadcasted on TV. Riot pays their LCS teams a monthly salary and during the last world championchip they filled the Staples Center in LA and had a $2 mio price pool. <br />
Meanwhile, WoW doesn't even have a freely available arena spectator client after all those years, and tournaments are tiny in comparison.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying one game is &quot;better&quot; than the other - people should play whatever they like. (My biggest pet peeve with LoL is the community: you can barely play a game without people wanting to report each other, and saying things like &quot;get cancer and die&quot; etc.) But you should realize that even if it's f2p, LoL is huge compared to WoW - and the f2p model might very well be the future of online gaming in general. If WoW's subscription model isn't profitable any more some day, they probably also just go f2p like many other MMORPGs. And f2p doesn't mean that Riot doesn't earn money - you'd be surprised how many people sink good $$ in vanity items like different looking skins for their characters. <br />
In fact I'm a bit perplexed about this - just imagine how much work Blizzard has to do for all the art assets alone of dungeons, raids, the outside world etc. if they introduce a new expansion. Meanwhile, Riot releases like one new champion and one or two skins every 1-2 months, and people still buy that shit like crazy. &quot;Oh boy, that Spiritguard Udyr skin surely was a lot of work - let's charge people $25 for it.&quot; And a lot of people will buy this, although I find it hilariously overpriced.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit sad about all that shit Ghostcrawler gets though. He was just the face of the developers to the community - he didn't decide alone about balancing PvE &amp; PvP.<br />
Please also note that WoW is tough to balance because people invested so much time in their characters and feel like every nerf is a personal insult. In LoL, you don't really care - if one champion gets nerfed, you just play another one. And there isn't even a PvE part, so you don't really have to try to keep PvE'ers and PvP'ers alike happy.</div></div><hr />

....If you think Riot is some broke ass gaming company...your sorely mistaken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that he went from lead SYSTEM designer to (Co)Lead GAME designer. Instead of being a lead for a handful of pieces of the game he is now over seeing the entire game. How can people not understand this?</div></div><hr />

Crazy.<br />

Oh I dunno, bigger upcoming company? Much bigger game? A game that overshadows WoW and all but killed SC2?<br />

<br />
<br />
OR like anyone whos played WoW for a long time he's had enough and wants to play something different<br />
<br />
i'll be interested to see what he does at Riot<br />
<br />
His WoW job is far more relaxed compaired to the soap box he's getting on for League. Hope he's ready, but I think he will do well.<br />

OMG Riot is like a 10000 steps down of Blizzard maybe he got fired and blamed for the sub lost or something or Riot much payed a lot of money!<br />
<br />
Uh....at this current time it's actually a step up...a BIG step up....do some research before opening your mouth...<br />

Good thing I quit LoL, the game has been going downhill for the past year (and keep in mind that I'm talking balancing/design-wise here, not that it's losing players. since it's not - yet), now with GC on board it will get even worse that much faster.<br />
<br />
What rock are you under? Are you Bronze 5? The game is more balanced now than it's ever been.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moradim</div><div class="date">2014-01-15, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LoL is a much bigger deal than anything blizzard currently has on the table. Sorry to burst you fan boys bubbles. The worst diablo in the franchise, panda wow with constantly declining subs, a card game, and starcraft. Starcraft is the only thing still standing strong but its nowhere near as big as LoL. Don't cry too hard.<br />
<br />
lol is only popular cause its free. justin bieber is popular too. both are objectively shit. in any case, it's too bad he chose to work on the worst moba on the market (lol), and not say...dota2.<br />
<br />
then again, its probably a good thing: he has no grasp of PvP mechanics so this is a train wreck waiting to happen.<br />
<br />
oh well, enjoy spending your riot points kiddies, he's all yours now.</div></div><hr />

If &quot;because it's free&quot; is your only defense to insult League. Please keep trying. Dota 2 is free to play as well, it's number's don't even come close. It's viewership isn't even close. <br />
<br />
If you can't explain why it's the &quot;worst&quot; moba on the market...then don't bother flaming it. Don't even use the &quot;It's so much easier than Dota 2&quot; bullshit either. Your not a Diamond player, your not a challenger player and your not at the peak of it's skill, you don't know half of what it takes to be a professional at League.<br />
<br />
As for WOW pvp, someday some of you &quot;die hards&quot; will come to realize WoW was and never will be about PvP. It's a side thing in the game, always has, always will be. The game was not centered around PvP, and never will be. It's nigh impossible to balance every class and spec to damn near perfect for PvE and PvP basis. Let's see you try to do it? Do you have a lick of sense? Or are you one of those Sodapoppin salt licks who worship the ground he walks on cause he is &quot;god in WoW pvp&quot;....cause WoW PvP is sooooo relevant right (guess what, it's not and only a minority gives a crap). (Oh and to make you die hards more flaming hot, he was carried a lot to)<br />
<br />
Anyways, back on track, unless you can shoot well thought out, and insightful backups to your spewing, instead of &quot;lol omg it sucks cuz i said so go dota 2 roxxer league so no00b GC sux n Im better @ his j0b th@n h1m&quot;<br />
<br />
Your not.<br />
<br />

<br />
One thing I do like sense Ghost has left is the sound of the language coming out of Blizzard Devs, From the posts they have been making to the Q and A's. they sound more promising and seem like return to the way the system used to work.<br />
<br />
Who knows could just be me. But I will say this, goodbye GCrawler I'm sure not sad to see you gone.<br />

Well deep down your sad or else you wouldn't of made an alt account to cry about it.</div></div><hr />

Anyone here around thinks perhaps that the imminent delay announcement of WoD is the reason he left? Blizzard was bragging about how fast content can come out to players the last year yet, we are facing Siege of Orgrimar patch going to last for as much as a year! till new expansion hits.</div></div><hr />

I don't know, nor do I particularly care to be honest.<br />
<br />
I'm a LoL player and I feel a bit concerned though. I mean there's nothing wrong with GC and he probably did a great job at Blizzard, but he's a WoW dude for me, LoL is something as different as day and night. I don't know. I think it will be hard for people to get over this association.</div></div><hr />
