New User Interface Updates<br />
There are many new additions and changes coming in the near future for World of Warcraft. Alongside the hotly anticipated raid dungeon Ulduar (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/3p1/ulduar.xml (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/3p1/ulduar.xml)), several new user interface features will be debuting, and we’ve put together a preview of them to let you know what to expect when the patch arrives:<br />

Patch 3.1 PTR Ulduar damage analysis<br />
As another experiment, we are creating this thread for posting and analysis of PTR raid damage parses. If you don't understand what that means, you probably don't need to be posting in this thread.<br />
<br />
I am going to be keeping a low profile in this thread. Please do not use it to ask questions or make demands. Please do not include any pre-3.1 numbers unless they are solely for comparative purposes. Please do not make definitive statements unsupported by data. Please do not derail the thread. We will try to delete off-topic responses.<br />

Ulduar - Itemization<br />
Ulduar has more items than all of BC's raids put together, and that's with gear consolidation. Bring the player not the class was to allow groups more flexibility in inviting their friends and to make room for say Demonology warlocks, Balance druids, Marksman hunters and other specs that couldn't be fit into a Sunwell raid because of the inflexibility of the mandatory buff jigsaw puzzle. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15659711360-no-point-in-blaming-the-designers.html))<br />
<br />
Ulduar - Difficulty<br />
We had to fix some problems, and very rapid mana regeneration was one of them. Another big one was amazing tank cooldowns (mostly from the DK). However we stepped up the difficulty on the encounters too. There is no “just burn him down” boss like Noth. The trash will require crowd control on some pulls. Ulduar is not Sunwell. It is not a huge leap up in difficulty from Naxx, but it is a step up. If that isn’t enough of a challenge for you, then I suggest you try the hard modes and pay a visit to Algalon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15671261994-does-anyone-find-it-funny-that.html))<br />
<br />
Healers<br />
They should not be running out of mana in Ulduar if they play well. In Naxx you can do things like stand in fires, overheal like mad, bring players in green gear to get geared up, or not even explain the fights to pugs because you can brute force your way through them. One the mechanics that allows you to brute force is having so much mana regen. Now all of that is appropriate for the first raid tier. Things will start to get a little more difficult now, and a lot more difficult if you want to do the hardest fights. Naxx = play bad and win. Ulduar = play good and win. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15671261994-does-anyone-find-it-funny-that.html))<br />
<br />
Ulduar - Hard Modes<br />
Hard modes are designed to give very skilled groups something to do while still allowing more casual groups to see the content. Ulduar has 14 bosses. We haven't done an instance of that size since the original Naxxramas, and Ulduar has a lot more unique content than Naxx had. You are imagining a world in which if we had not done hard modes, you would have gotten another entire raid. That is a bad assumption. You would have gotten Ulduar, cleared it quickly, and then been bored again.<br />
<br />
Yes, we know players given the choice will always want more content. If we offered 6 levels of raid content, there are still players who would clear it quickly and be looking for something new.

Argent Tournament on PTRs<br />
Thanks for the reports about being unable to champion for a third faction; we found an issue with it and corrected it. You should see it in the next update. <br />
<br />
I believe the next time the PTR is updated I'll be making a post calling for focused testing on the Tournament. Obviously we've still got an eye on the relative difficulty of the valiants and the champions, and I do appreciate the feedback you've given thus far.

360° Swipe in 3.1<br />
The correct range for the new, 360 Swipe should be 8 yards. It appears to only be 5 in your version of the data. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15671261184-druids-response-to-the-new-swipe.html))<br />

Spirit affecting DPS in the future?<br />
I said that a proper benefit of Spirit to mages would be for it to affect dps. But I cautioned that you should not expect your dps to go up overnight because of this change. Perhaps I was being too cautious, but I know that at least some players are hoping to get free dps out of the deal. The problem we are trying to fix here is not &quot;mage dps is too low.&quot; The problem we are trying to fix is &quot;mage gear has spirit, which doesn't do much for them except for a small bit of in-combat mana regen.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you think mage dps is too low, that is a separate topic, but we would still be unlikely to fix that by suddenly giving you 10 dps for every point of spirit on your gear. <br />
<br />
[...] I said mage A (little to no Spirit on gear) and mage B (Spirit on gear) would have similar dps. Currently A has higher dps because she has no &quot;wasted stats.&quot;<br />
<br />
I probably ended up confusing some people because I was trying to be too cautious in saying do not expect mage B &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mage A. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15657788662-mage-spirit-more-useful--still-planned.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems they're helping druids out a bit.<br />
<br />
Still, 5 yards, or 8 yards actually,, isn't a great lot if you compare it to Death and decay that DKs can toss anywhere. Druids are very localized in terms of aoe threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the pvp sets... they seem quite lame.<br />
DK neck is very unprotected.<br />
Rogues get a &quot;dot&quot; on their forehead, wtf? Those white bands had better turn black in the final release.<br />
The other sets seem a mix and match of older sets, with some fixed and recolors.<br />

Seems the blizzard art team is running out of ideas :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I personally like the warrior pvp sets...<br />
<br />
And all you pvp-ers, please don't forget, that S6 will bring only 1 set of pvp gear, an upgrade from Deadly Gladiator set.. and the current sets fall down 1 spot in the hierarchy.. (if I'm right)<br />
<br />
Therefore it makes sense to &quot;improve&quot; the current sets' look, and so be able to discover some similarity.<br />

The pvp sets will evolve as the seasons progress. Meaning that S5 was the base of what is yet to be done to pvp models. They looked incredibly basic and are just starting to have some minor upgrades to them. As time goes by and seasons end and begin new pvp sets will come out that will be evolved from the old ones with brand new details on them. In a few seasons we'll see some very good looking sets full of detail. But it will never be incredibly shiny and pointy. Those are PVE sets. PVP sets will remain a bit more basic.<br />
DK head does indeed look pretty horrible.</div></div><hr />

Does that mean the PVP set should be crafted out of the nipples from 82 years old persian carpet dealer? Seriously, those face covers and cloth headpieces rly dont look like mail/leather to me :D.<br />

And all you pvp-ers, please don't forget, that S6 will bring only 1 set of pvp gear, an upgrade from Deadly Gladiator set.. and the current sets fall down 1 spot in the hierarchy.. (if I'm right)<br />

Therefore it makes sense to &quot;improve&quot; the current sets' look, and so be able to discover some similarity.<br />

WTF is that crap ? At least s1-s4 has some uniqueness in them... only a few of them where ugly. They are mixing ugly 60s item with some random green graphics ( you know those 70-80 greens ) recolored.<br />
<br />
WoW blizz...<br />

You completly screwed arena allowing FOTM OP classes to dominate most of S5 before balancing them<br />

<br />
Except for maybe the shaman set, which is a tad silly.<br />
<br />
As been stated before, these sets are like an evolved or upgraded version of the S5 sets. They got a smoother color scheme, they got more details and generally look a lot more epic.<br />
<br />
The mage one, Paladin one and Warrior one is the best of these imo. The hunter one is also pretty nice although it's kinda goofy on a human. It looks royal'ish, and I bet that it's gonna look pretty darn nice on say a night elf when you are actually in-game and hes explosive shotting your ass off.<br />
<br />
Oh and contrary to the general opinion in this thread so far, I'm also very fond of the rogue set. Finally a set that looks like real raw leather, and what a battle-thief would look like. The colorscheme is a bit off, but imagine it being black or dark grey, and it would look very badass.<br />
<br />
The current S5 ones was kinda dull I agree, but this is definately a step up. If this is the direction the arena sets are going, I personally can't wait to see the next tier - or the tier after that! That's gonna be some fierce effing looking armor if you ask me.<br />
<br />
For once im actually quite content with the art team. S7 and S8 is gonna look BOMB if they continue this trend.</div></div><hr />

To be honest its just stupid how full of whine you guys can be.

Blizzard explained the thought behind the pvp sets looking like they do ages ago. Cant be arsed to find a source but it was something along the lines of gear crafted for use in pvp battle rather than gear crafted from 400 dragon scales and Kel'thuzad's shinbone (read: pve tier gear). <br />
<br />
If you consider what it's going to be used for I personally think the sets fit really well with it. It also creates a division between PvE'ers and PvP'ers that wasn't the case in TBC. For me, it's more what the gear you wear says about your character and less what it looks like. I think my rogue looks great in his t7.5 and just as great in his hateful/savage gear (yeah flame away, I don't make a serious attempt at pvp).<br />
And lets face it, you know that the people wearing the s6 gear within a month or two of release are good pvp'ers, and e-peen is half the game, isn't it? ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
remember the days where pve gear was good in pvp?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheColtrain</div><div class="date">2009-03-17, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well in all the QQ lets take a serious look at things:<br />
<br />
1) The design team already stated that PvP gear would be less about 10,000 year old nipples and more about basic design. 'Real' gladiators looked much more like Druid in the image. 'Real' gladiators usually wore a helm, a single shoulder piece, and a few scraps here and there where they could. <br />
<br />
2) Anyone who says 'OMG S1-5 WERE AMZNG'... well yes they were, but they were just recolors of PvE content. I like the idea of looking different from the PvE people. Can any scrub get the basic set? Yes. Can any scrub get the rating to get a full top set? No. <br />
<br />
Next, take a look at the image we have of the sets:<br />
<br />
Death Knight - Simple, follows the basic 'dark' look of the DK armor sets. Helm does seam a little out of place, may look better from a different angle. Should his fingers not be covered?<br />
<br />
Druid - Of all the sets this one has the best combination of 'simple' and 'leather' look to it.<br />
<br />
Hunter - A little too flashy, in my mind should be more about the 'camo' vibe. Cowel on the head? Not sure if that really fits the hunter profile.<br />
<br />
Mage - I like this set a lot! Looks very 'magic', and for those who spec Fire I am sure the red will be very welcome.<br />
<br />
Paladin - Really like the look of this set but the helm seams a little out of place. All those 'third eye' gems on models, not really my cup of tea. The shoulders look a lot better, reminded me of S3 warrior shoulders.<br />
<br />
Priest - Just cant find the connection here ??? <br />
<br />
Shaman - Not too bad at all, again not a huge fan of the helm.<br />
<br />
Rogue - I think there are way too many colors going on here. And again with the floating third eye! I love the idea of a mask on the rogue, but I think a more basic color scheme would have gone a long way on this model.<br />
<br />
Warlock - Nice and dark, I think that the eye area should be dark though, gives them that 'evil' feel.<br />
<br />
Warrior - Ahhh warriors. Of the new modles, I believe that warriors have looked the best. More spikes are ok in my book, and the armor all fits together very well</div></div><hr />

It's limiting, and apparently results in lackluster color themes. Excessive shades of red cloth with green gems, makes the Priest look annoyingly Christmasy. <br />
<br />
This is how I believe the Priest should look in season 6.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">enkhada</div><div class="date">2009-03-17, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) The design team already stated that PvP gear would be less about 10,000 year old nipples and more about basic design. 'Real' gladiators looked much more like Druid in the image. 'Real' gladiators usually wore a helm, a single shoulder piece, and a few scraps here and there where they could. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Interesting point of view, but problem is that wow isnt 'real'. Nothing in that game have to do with anything in real life, nobody want it. No armor set in game look like real medieval knights armor. So why would we compare to it.<br />
<br />
Im only asking why they doing so well creating pve tiers and why they leave pvp sets so ugly.<br />
<br />
Naxx tier7 is recolored and redesigned tier3, yes because is still naxxramas, where all that beggin. Tier7 looks awesome. And now they present tier8, hell that awesome either. So why are they doing these crapy skins for pvp sets? Somebody said here, that pvp is about skill and not about good looking. Well true, but doest it mean that skilled player can look like garbage pail? No. And Im sure that nobody want it. Ppl was asking for different skins for pvp sets, not just recolored pve tiers. We get it, also true. Take a look at tier7 and tier8 compera to s5 s6, in both cases pvp sets looks pretty shity. Reason?<br />
<br />
S6 death knight sitting on engineering bike, hey guys a cop trying to give u a ticket, move on! Stupid</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fibre</div><div class="date">2009-03-17, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it's the armor itself that is not right, except for maybe the Death Knight helmet, and the Hunter set. IMO it's just the colors are way out of whack. The designers are throwing too many shades and mixing colors in ways that don't work. <br />

Or was it pro-bono work by the braille institute of modern design?<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the design effort seems fitting, as the design probably took about the same skill and effort as pushing a DK Pally or lularcane team past 2K rating this &quot;season.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Season 6 is a brilliant idea, a slightly upgraded season 5. Can you imagine what these armour sets will be looking liek by season 8 hehehe, very epic indeed.<br />
<br />
All the fans moaning about how season 5 doesnt look epic enough, now I see what Blizzard were up to! THis is a great idea. <br />
<br />
They normally make like 6 colours of armour these days, Im sure rogues one wont be final tbh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
7000 year old dragon nipples<br />
<br />
<br />
i just made this account to tell you how stupid you're.<br />
1st like blizz say 7000 year old dragon is a lame excuse, did they trying to make sense in to the game, if anything was make sense in the frist place, example so a 7000year old dragon ( spend all his life making those fuking gear) for ppl to raid them and killed him to get a reward? and the ally or horde make much uglyer gear cause compair to those dragon spending 7000year just to make the gears, MAKE ANY SENSE? well guess what, notting make sense is a fucking fantasy game plz dont try to put any sense in to the game cause it retarded, unless is a game base on real life.<br />
<br />
And for those retarded ppl who say that the pvp gear even look OK.<br />
you seriously dont pvp or you just retarded and have a ratting below 1500, that why you dont even care(stick to your 3button PVE skill and your not even good at pve /sigh).<br />
<br />
Out of all the gears rogue PVE and PVP set is so Fukin stupid, i feel sorry for them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aekero</div><div class="date">2009-03-19, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First few things that popped into my head.<br />
<br />
I actually like the paladin/warrior tier 10 piece sets better than the 25, does dark = better? Especially in the case of paladins,<br />
I've wondered why they haven't really given paladins a &quot;white&quot; colored set, aside from<br />
tier 4 which was close...<br />
<br />
25 vs 10 man dk armor looks so different...amazing. Kinda like tier 7's. All dark with a slight difference in the splash color, meh.<br />
<br />
So 3.1 comes out in a month or two, then a few (or more) months later, Argent event comes out.<br />
Complete that in a couple months much like AQ40 event (sounds cool actually), then most likely grind some sort of pvp or pve element for a decent amount of time and rewarded with....*drum roll*<br />
<br />
A heroic dungeon end level equivalent weapon, hooray! Seriously? By then everyone will be gearing up their 4th alts off-spec, and even they will be able to run naxx 10. Even if these weapons mean a gaurunteed weapon for time spent, doesn't it seem like they're a bit sub-par for when/how they're<br />
being implemented?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fibre</div><div class="date">2009-03-20, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that besides the Druid/Hunter sets, the armor itself isn't the big problem, but rather the color. There's a mishmash of odd-color combinations, and a lack of contrast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How the hell u know i cannot draw anything past a stickman? And even if so... what does it have to do with blizzard making sh1tlooking gear instead of goodlooking gear?<br />
This LOOKS SH1TTY or at least SH1TTIER than PVE SETS and every1 who disagrees must be blind so u'd better doubt their &quot;artistic senses&quot; or whatever<br />
