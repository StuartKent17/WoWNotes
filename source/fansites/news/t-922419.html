<br />
With just rolling restarts planned? Doubtful.<br />
<br />
So am I correct in reading that not only when 4.2 lands on the 21st, the Season 9 gear will already be available from the Vendor for Honor Points, but I'll have a week to spend all my HP, so I don't have to worry about the 4k cap? The latter part is explicit, the former I'm not so sure.</div></div><hr />

Well back in April they actually had 11.4 million subs. From the launch of Cataclysm to April they lose 600,000 subs due to lack of content. So I would say they must have dropped another 200,000 easy since April. So at a rough guess, around 11.2 million players. Still a lot, but would love to see the numbers next April when Guild Wars 2 and SWTOR are launched.</div></div><hr />

Probably the fact that as time goes by, we get closer to the patch release date, hence, we are getting closer. In 2 more days, we'll be 2 more days closr to the patch release date, and then they'll be even more excited.</div></div><hr />

Anything that costs Valor will cost Justice. Anything that costs Conquest will cost Honor. Nothing else changes. If the piece required an item token before, it will require one after. You'll have to down those bosses and win the tokens to purchase those pieces. <br />
<br />
All Season 9 items will cost Honor Points (equivalent to their previous Conquest Point cost) when the season ends, with the exception of any items with rating requirements attached. These items will no longer be available for purchase.</div></div><hr />

Here's what it looks like:<br />
VP will be converting to JP on 4.2. Any excess of 4k will be converted to cash immediately.<br />
CP will be converting to HP on 4.2. Any excess of 4k will be converted to cash when the next arena season starts (1 week later, i.e. 6/28), so you have a week to buy down below the cap.</div></div><hr />

I see, so there's no way to farm VP so i can get all available 4.2 VP items on launch?<br />

No. The reason for this is because there is only a weekly cap for VP and CP, not a total cap. If VP and CP did not transfer over, players &quot;late&quot; to the season/tier would have an advantage over others who've been grinding and gearing up throughout (or someone could actually spend an entire season doing low MMR arena accumulating points and start off the next season with a full set of Conquest gear).</div></div><hr />

Not only uPnP, even to sort you own chars/toon took Blizz devs 5/6 years to make. <br />

Wait, according to most forum posts, I thought BC, WotLK, and Cataclysm removed all the fun, since Vanilla was the best ever...?</div></div><hr />
