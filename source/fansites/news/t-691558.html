Invincible Rising<br />
The mare Brightmane gave birth to Invincible as a young Prince Arthas watched with rapt attention.<br />
<br />
In the years following Invincible's birth, the horse and Arthas formed a bond that carried them across the warring nations of Azeroth, through the icy grip of death, and into the throes of battle.<br />
<br />
The stallion's coiled muscles were made for speed, and Arthas often felt that his mount flew rather than galloped across the countryside. With the slightest touch of his heel, Arthas was able to convey his directions, and Invincible obeyed without question or hesitation.<br />
<br />
It was Invincible's unfaltering faith in his master that inevitably led to the stallion's death and unholy rebirth. On a cold winter afternoon as snow was blanketing the ground, Arthas was desperate to get away from the city even if it meant riding through harsh and unforgiving weather. Once outside, Arthas guided Invincible over a familiar jump, but the stallion slipped on slick ice, and the fall shattered his forelegs. With no way to save his companion, Arthas was forced to give Invincible a merciful death, and the prince carried that guilt with him for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Years later, after the Lich King granted Arthas necromantic powers, Arthas returned to the grave where he had buried Invincible and raised his loyal servant into undeath. It was in this dark act that Arthas felt a sense of purpose. He believed that Invincible's death was not an accident; rather, it was essential to Arthas's destiny. <br />
<br />
Invincible was not bred to be a warhorse, but after he was brought back from the dead and made immune to hunger, pain, and exhaustion, he became the perfect steed for Arthas. Now the skeletal charger stalks Icecrown Citadel, ever at the ready to serve his beloved master.<br />
<br />
Arthas and Invincible were as one until parted by the stallion's untimely death. Now, they are rejoined in death through the power of the Lich King and pose a fearsome sight for all who gaze upon them. Only the power of the heroes of Azeroth can part them once more.<br />
<br />
In order to attain such a steed, one must conquer Icecrown Citadel and face the Lich King on Heroic difficulty. Perhaps you will be the lucky individual to obtain the most coveted of mounts -- the Invincible Charger. This reward awaits those who are brave enough to tempt fate and face the full wrath of the Lich King! <br />

I actually like the way they've done PvP sets this time around. Starting with a basic gear model, and then making them progressively more decorative as seasons progress. Sure it may not be as cool as the re-colored raid sets from BC, but they do have their own personal style. As you progress through the seasons, it's like you're modifying your gear, which makes better sense than just copying whatever the raiders are wearing.</div></div><hr />

1. Warlock (most detailed set of all, designer plays lock hands down :x )<br />
2. Paladin<br />
3. DK<br />
4. Mage<br />
5. Warrior<br />
6. Rogue<br />
7. Priest <br />
8. Druid<br />
9. Shaman<br />
10. Hunter (LOL Rickrolled?)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Swap Shaman with Hunter and we are on the same idea. Shaman set looks like nightgown.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druid - great shoulders, lame head. Overall looks good on humans, so it will look great on NE/Taurens. 7/10<br />
<br />
Hunter - blizz needs to put more effort in making hunter gear sets or most of the hunters will start rerolling due to lack of attention their class gets. Srsly, I need a pic with &quot;WTF IS THIS SHIT&quot; to explain my feelings :P. Looks terrible. 2/10 (2 points for making the set :P)<br />
<br />
Mage - looks dark and looks great. Great on humans, so imagine other races. 10/10<br />
<br />
Paladin - represents &quot;light&quot; very much what a paladin needs. Looks good on humans, will look better on some other races. 8/10<br />
<br />
Priest - needs more love. 4/10<br />
<br />
Shaman - nice touch to the shoulders rest sucks. Looks ok on humans and will look the same on most other races. Can say shamans got screwed for the 1st time (?) 5/10<br />
<br />
Rogue - although the set looks a little like plate, it is very good overall. Looks good on humans and will look a lot better on most other classes. 8/10<br />
<br />
Warlock - Great helm, great shoulders, nothing more to say. 10/10<br />
<br />
Warrior - Everything looks great untill i saw the boots :P. Still a very cool set. 9/10</div></div><hr />

seriously. It all looks pretty good and a well evolved set from previous seasons, excluding the hunter set. Its just bad, coloring is bad, design is really bad. Whats with that helm?

nice how the detail is insane now (compared to before) but the style is just ridiculous looking. locks used to look like what you'd expect and now they look like something you'd see on a cereal box<br />
<br />
just horrid looking for all sets. priests look like futuristic mailmen and they sure love the warrior faceguardhelm design</div></div><hr />

Why is it so hard to replicate the look of those sets?<br />

Jeez<br />
<br />
<br />
they peaked there<br />
<br />
actually, the people who designed that stuff aren't the people who are designing it now. what was good is trying to be avoided so these guys can &quot;make their mark&quot; and it's just not working at all. all the tier and season gear has been just completely goofy in wotlk</div></div><hr />

Druid and paladin sets are good but alittle too much like the previous sets, and I'm noot too keen on the huge collar on the Paladin set. I like the new shamn helmet and the new shoulders. The robe is aweful though. The priest set had alot of details on the robes, and you don't see something else than shoulders/head being the focus on alot of sets. Too bad the head and shoulders look aweful though.<br />
<br />
Hunter set is... well it has a certain... if you tilt your head just alittle... No, there's nothing positive about it.</div></div><hr />

IMO (dont care about the lore) the wings should be there when the mount is flying and then be shaded out (shadowpriest looks with a pally touch of it) so it would have the paladin wings scaled to the mounts size but with a shadowpriest faded out look to match the rest of it...</div></div><hr />

The only two good sets there are Lock and Pally. Weapons look reasonably okay. But hopefully they'll improve the sets for when s8 hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The most important thing is to be relatively unique between all these &quot;yeah I just won T x y on VoA&quot; PvE-guys who all look about the same. Assuming this it makes me sad that the design of several PvE weapons was obviously taken for PvP gear...such as the shield oder the 2H axe. <br />
<br />
Great job with the pally gear ! loving it. Don't really care about the rest.<br />
<br />
Some point I always dislike is taking the human model for spoiling sets. No one can seriously like the male human model if he's sane. I'd rather wait 1 more day for a spoiler if it would spare me watching these warm brothers wearing amazing gear sets ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">foo</div><div class="date">2010-01-28, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually like the way they've done PvP sets this time around. Starting with a basic gear model, and then making them progressively more decorative as seasons progress. Sure it may not be as cool as the re-colored raid sets from BC, but they do have their own personal style. As you progress through the seasons, it's like you're modifying your gear, which makes better sense than just copying whatever the raiders are wearing.<br />

I guess the whole purpose of this modifying the armor using the same style for each season but adding more and more onto it was a ploy to see how ridiculous looking the armor in this game could get... the shoulders on all of those are almost as wide as the character is tall... lol at the rogue ninja gaiden thing and the warrior super shredder thing... lock isn't bad but wtf is with the mage, paladin, and hunter sets... also priest is by far the least complicated... shaman and druid aren't horrible either but still... all of these are ridiculous... let's hope the armor designers show a little restraint with the Cataclsym pvp stuff...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know, maybe it's just me but i have to point out some things that seem ridiculous at least to me about these sets.<br />
<br />
DK - Look at the chest and the legs... don't you think that they seem to be a lilbit oversized? Especially the chest on the front pics<br />
<br />
Drood - srsly WTF are these shoulders? They are not too big, at all... or are they? And these little &quot;eyeholes&quot; on opposite sides of the helm... This helm would fit meh for sure! (http://img20.imageshack.us/img20/5601/bunnye.jpg)<br />
<br />
Hunter - em... do I have to say sth? I saw a post that made me rofl rly hard, it was sth about the Force which hunters will use to aim wearing that helm. And the lower part of the boots look exactly like my socks right now.<br />
<br />
Mage - When i saw it i was like WTF IS THAT HELM OMGROFLMAO... this eye efect and some shit floating above, it ruins all x/ But taking it out of consideration whole set is not that bad<br />
<br />
Paladin - One word: shoulders. THEY LOOK FCKING HILARIOUS. R.I.P all those birds who smash their heads on that perky thingy.<br />
<br />
Priest - Well, I don't know... it looks like it's not finished yet, especially the helm, this blue texture, helm need some love definitely. I also noticed that [hunters helm] - [horns] = [priests helm] but that's on a side note<br />
<br />
Shaman - It seems that Blizzard lost somewhere this idea of cloth/leather/mail/plate. Now it's only a word attached to the window which appears when you mouseover an item. There were casters t9 and warlock t10 which all looked like mail, now comes shaman s8 which looks like cloth and it's so obvious that I can't understand the way they design new items. It seems that they completely abandoned the concept of partitioning items on cloth, leather, mail and plate. But man, it's final set of expansion! Put some effort in makeing these items look appropriately, I mean - IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE MAIL! Let clothies wear cloth...<br />
<br />
Rogue - It doesn't apply only to rogue but in this case it's obvious (hunters s8 too): what's so cool about these shiny pebbles which Blizzard is sticking everywhere they can, rly WTF?! They should stop doing so...<br />
<br />
Warlock - I like it, I don't really have anything to say about it besides it's mailish again, but it looks nice at least.<br />
<br />
Warrior - The shoulders issue in this case have definitely came too far. Imagine orc wearing that shoulders. Every shoulders on orc are huge but these will be huge on gnome and on orc ENORMOUS and I dont think it's cool. Also I find that kind of spike right between my eyes a little bit distracting and it looks dumb. It's like you put your fist against your nose and try to read a book - GL&amp;HF. Leggings? /facepalm<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't stop wondering how they could make so big fail designing final pvp item set, and it's not like I'm saying I'd do it better cuz i wouldn't but they've got some artists there, real artists, and these artists earn some big money for doing their job which many ppl dream to have a chance to do and THAT looks like designed by ppl who are sick and tired of their pursuit, who don't give a shit about what ppl will think about it cuz regardless what ppl think they keep earning money so what's the problem? And that's sad.<br />
<br />

I should probably learn to accept it by now... but... seriously, why are the thrown the same size as the 1H axes? ._.<br />

Rogues just look.. idk meh... Its like they're wearing a metal bowl on their head and two tooth picks on their shoulders lmao.<br />
<br />
After all, in s7 Warriors all stacked armor pen, and UA stacked with MS, which is why warriors facerolled hard during then. (Aside from the fact that they also have a ranged AoE Snare, Hamstering, Charge and intercept have no DR, can outlast the whole match if bubbled and healed.)<br />
<br />
^ Arms, Prot is prot got nerfed. Isn't that bad now, nor do they have an MS effect.</div></div><hr />

Also love the mage helm, somewhat reminds me of lock T4</div></div><hr />

I get the feeling that they are less &quot;wow&quot; and more of some other fantasy games, could just be me tho ^^</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onahail</div><div class="date">2010-01-28, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DK - nice touch with the frostmourne skull on shoulders and helm. Overall looks ok on humans, so it will look alot better on other races. 7/10<br />
<br />
Druid - great shoulders, lame head. Overall looks good on humans, so it will look great on NE/Taurens. 7/10<br />
<br />
Hunter - blizz needs to put more effort in making hunter gear sets or most of the hunters will start rerolling due to lack of attention their class gets. Srsly, I need a pic with &quot;WTF IS THIS SHIT&quot; to explain my feelings :P. Looks terrible. 2/10 (2 points for making the set :P)<br />
<br />
Mage - looks dark and looks great. Great on humans, so imagine other races. 10/10<br />
<br />
Paladin - represents &quot;light&quot; very much what a paladin needs. Looks good on humans, will look better on some other races. 8/10<br />
<br />
Priest - needs more love. 4/10<br />
<br />
Shaman - nice touch to the shoulders rest sucks. Looks ok on humans and will look the same on most other races. Can say shamans got screwed for the 1st time (?) 5/10<br />
<br />
Rogue - although the set looks a little like plate, it is very good overall. Looks good on humans and will look a lot better on most other classes. 8/10<br />
<br />
Warlock - Great helm, great shoulders, nothing more to say. 10/10<br />
<br />
Warrior - Everything looks great untill i saw the boots :P. Still a very cool set. 9/10<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You know what this reminds me of? That episode of family guy with &quot;Rides his bike everywhere guy&quot; and he's being interviewed by Asian Reporter Trisha Takanowa (sp?). He ends every line he says with &quot;annnd it's a great way to stay in shape.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Pally looks alright... but somethings off about it. maybe the eyes, maybe the color.<br />
<br />
negs: hunter = lol, i hope they fix this set to look nice. at LEAST make the shoulders bigger on him.<br />
shaman looks like a clothy. <br />
priest looks a lil mis-match. <br />
color choice on warlock should be darker, not seasonal/autumn themed. that bland orange just doesnt say &quot;warlock&quot; to me.</div></div><hr />
