<br />
Sid &quot;Supatease&quot; Compston studied music performance in college, and he draws parallels between his love for music and his love for World of Warcraft. “Playing in a band is a lot like playing in an Arena team, dungeon team, or raid team—coordinating a diverse set of classes to conquer great foes,” he said. Inspired by casting greats like Isaac &quot;Azael&quot; Cummings-Bentley, Dan “Artosis” Stemkoski and Sean “Day9” Plott, Supatease began casting community events in 2014 before graduating to professional live events the following year. When he’s not casting AWC, you can find him on his personal channels, where he focuses on entertainment and education for all skill levels, dispersed with random flute interludes.<br />

<br />
An avid WoW player since Classic, Rich Campbell used to pass the time drawing pictures of his Druid in Latin class. “I wanted to be a Moonkin and ride on a tiger,” he said, “but my first level-capped toon was my Warlock. It’s always been my main, although I’m an alt-aholic.” After going to college for game design, his start in casting came as a surprise opportunity while working at MLG as a cameraman. “Chris Puckett was getting married, he needed a fill-in to cast and that was how I got started,” Rich said. “When WoW came to MLG, I lost my mind.” Rich is inspired by his parents, whose work ethic he tries to emulate in his everyday life. “I try to always work as hard as them even though I have a job a lot of people want. I try to always get better, because there are so many deserving people out there who don’t get chances,” he said. “I had to fight for all my chances, too, and I remember that every day.”<br />

<br />
Elliott &quot;Venruki&quot; Venczel began his life in the WoW esports space as a professional Arena player, maining a Mage. The highlights of his career include playing at BlizzCon 2010 and winning the 2012 Battle.net World Championship in Shanghai. Today, he is a caster for the AWC, but you will often find him streaming World of Warcraft Arena for Method on his Twitch channel. His advice for people looking to get into Arena is to read your abilities, set up your key binds, watch streams, and have fun dueling outside your capital city of choice—he thinks it’s an important and fun way to learn how your class interacts with others.<br />

The Swedish Mage with the mellifluous voice, Mohamed &quot;Ziqo&quot; Beshir rounds out the casting talent for the Spring Season of the AWC. He has played World of Warcraft since his early teens and is well-known for his deep knowledge and analysis on the desk. Ziqo is an avid streamer for Method, where you’ll often find him in his downtime. Being a Mage isn’t the only thing Ziqo has in common with Venruki: they also are both dedicated vegans. Ziqo loves his vegan burgers and encouraging good-natured vegan copy-pastas in his stream chat, so be sure to give him a visit.<br />

This group will be your storytellers for the first 2019 season of the Arena World Championship. Set aside some time to kick back, relax, lay out your IRL mage tables, and join us for the next chapter of WoW PvP esports. We can’t wait to see you there!</div></div><hr />

I thought it was a good read. I hope people can just appreciate the skills of those guilds...the top 2 above all of them, but even the top 20 or top 50 will achieve what pretty much none of us could. (enter the one guy here who isin a top 10 guild)<br />

<br />
there is three &quot;ugly scar faces&quot; and you could ping me...<br />
also you are looking at a stable default face picture, not actual ingame.. .so yeah it will look lifeless. much like this does <br />
https://i.imgur.com/Nhqucu7.png<br />
ANY face in wow, in its most default position, in a picture not moving will look lifeless...<br />
<br />
also no, no fan has done an objectivly better job... you seem to be all hot over the vrykul look for the females, that for some reason removes all fat from them to just be MOOSCLES!!!<br />

<br />
The biggest problem for me though, will be the casting animations. I saw male Kul Tirans will get female pandaren casting animations. That's horrible.<br />
All the new races are given casting animations where they are flailing their arms all over the place. The original races have so much more better animations. Human, undead, gnomes... that's the casting animations that look good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It always depends on what you call fat. Bearish lumberjack look for sure...just fat and wobbly will not do it tho. Those male facials really look like a very negative drag and that's not going to be what players want to look like. A char either needs to be goodlooking or at least scary...average just does not work.</div></div><hr />

I agree completely. I dislike Method just because they can choose to have better public appearance but they don't. As they would say it them selves &quot;It's easy&quot;.<br />

For me it was the bit where they all race changed to Troll. Those guys get paid to play, right?<br />

I don't dislike any guild as such, because I really don't know anyone of them - but we need these juggernauts to headbutt...be it Paragon and Nihilum / Ensidia in the past or guilds like Death and Taxis / SKGaming.<br />
<br />
Sure, there is always that guy who goes &quot;Nobody cares about World First in a Video game&quot; - but that is just part of the name-calling as guilds do to challenge them.<br />
<br />
Guess now Limit's goal will be to win the final raid tier of BfA to redeem themselves for the past.<br />
<br />
<br />
And all this fat drama is why we will never get playable ogres.<br />
<br />
I actually think we could, because they are fairly removed from humans - and that probably triggers people here. Stupid really...bitch about the fat humans, but dwarves are stocky, so that is fine and the bulimic Blood Elves females are hot.</div></div><hr />

Here goes: Wall of text:<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: This is not for excuses. Method beat us handily by out playing us and out preparing us. This is simply to explain what was happening behind the scenes for those wondering.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that Jaina is finally dead for both of our guilds, Limit's curtain is pulled back. Streams are back on. What a lot of people are now wondering whether from curiosity or desire for schadenfreude, how did Limit get beaten by an entire reset?<br />
<br />
<br />
From the top<br />
16 HOURS OMEGALUL<br />
<br />
<br />
We started the raid well, and got off to a start that had many stating that it was our race to lose (raid was easy though, we did not think it was in the bag from day one at all of course). The first 8 bosses, as many others have observed or stated, were incredibly under tuned. This allowed us to brute force many of the bosses. Historically our strategies have been quite on point, however in this raid many of them look messy or were clearly not the best (e.g. Rastakhan and Blockade), and yet we still secured the first kill on each. For example, Big Dumb Guild’s Rastakhan strategy is perfect, it is outstanding, and should be copied by all. We had the first kill on the boss, but it can be simply attributed to “just play well”. Instead of having a deep understanding of the dread reaping spawners (aka “balls”), we sent all melee down to the death realm and our fantastic resto shaman Maevy solo heal it. This is definitely not as reproducible as sending ranged that can just plant and handily push Bwonsamdi without even needing to move using BDG’s more thoughtful strategy.<br />
<br />
Similarly on Blockade, while we did secure the first kill, we took 80 attempts. It must be said that since guilds are now killing the boss in 5-10 attempts for the first time I’m not sure it would be the same if they had to come up with their own strategy, but clearly in the end the other strategies presented for that boss were better than ours. After all, one thing is clear: Battle of Dazralor was a 1 boss raid. Everything else was woefully undertuned. The classic response to that statement would be that Blizzard doesn’t tune bosses for the top 0.1%, and that we go overboard on gearing and preparation so of course it should be that way. However, we killed Blockade with an average item level of 400.7. The very same week Method had conquered Jaina with 406 item level. The lowest publicly logged kills of Mythic Mekkatorque and Mythic Blockade are above 402. This is not meant to brag, but rather just to refute the ever present argument regarding tuning. You should not be able to kill a 2nd and 3rd last bosses as sloppy as we did with an average item level equaling heroic gear. These bosses have typically required good execution, and so called “perfect pulls”. Every boss aside from Jaina is extremely forgiving and has low health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arriving at Jaina<br />
<br />
<br />
We were very excited to have killed Blockade before Method had gotten past Mekkatorque. We were confident, riding high, and started work on Jaina. Initially Jaina barely hurt the tanks, and also moved so sporadically as to be detrimental (not moving at all when the tank was standing out of range for 6+ seconds, or randomly moving across the boat on the pull). Both of these were fixed on Thursday and Friday respectively. We found out later her tank damage was actually not working properly and was bugged, and a fix made that aspect much harder (we initially thought it was just a buff, not a bug fix).<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 1<br />
<br />
We worked mostly on getting the first intermission clean. We tried many strategies, but eventually landed on having our prot paladins skystep potion the left and right sides, interrupt as many of the Images as they could, and then purposely get Frozen Solid in front of Jaina (Ice blocks would block further glacial shards). This was a good strategy starting out, but eventually everyone got better at dodging and intentional ice blocks weren’t needed. What was most valuable from this day is finding that Moonkins could detect the positioning of the boss and images, and allowed us to call a “fast” and “slow” side. Since the boss positioning was random, we did not rely on a left and right side, but rather made it dynamic sending the fastest classes on the side that would have more images every time.<br />
<br />
Day 2<br />
<br />
This day we worked on phase 2 mostly. We had gotten the boss to 33% on our best pull before the noteworthy “4 stack” bug that was shown on Method’s stream the next day occurred right after our dinner break. This severely hampered progression for the rest of our day as it did for the first half of Method’s following day. We ended up having the entire raid use Skystep potions to at least make use of our time and practice Phase 2, but even in doing that a perfectly executed intermission would net you 1 more stack than a typical non-bugged intermission.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 3<br />
<br />
On this day we broke through the wall, and saw phase 3 a handful of times. Our best pull on the day was 24%, so suffice to say we did not see too far into the phase. We tried killing the Tide Elemental, but here we figured that it was best to ignore. Early on we entertained the idea of the burn/zerg strat for phase 3. Math was done, and the guild was split about 50/50 on whether or not you thought that the burn was possible. Nevertheless the argument was made to try to burn the boss regardless as you still were able to practice the phase 3 mechanics regardless of what strategy you were trying, and the burn strat generally netted you more time spent in phase 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 4<br />
<br />
On this day we worked on burning the boss in phase 3. Our best pull was 18%, and shortly after we abandoned the burn strategy considering it impossible for us to do this week. We started working on alternative strategies involving everything from killing the elemental to rotations of intentional ice blocks. Near the end of the raid we had some promising ideas for intentional ice blocks in phase 3, but not enough time to practice and implement them. On this day Method actually passed us in best pull % (doing their burn I believe they reached 15% this day), but at the time we had had many more phase 3 pulls and considered ourselves “still ahead” having much more practice in phase 3. We also thought that for both guilds the burn would be impossible this week, and that Method would need to find a control strategy for phase 3…<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 5<br />
<br />
On this day we tried to get creative in phase 3. The most promising strategy we felt was to intentionally ice block a group of 5 melee that we thought could break out the entire rest of the raid by themselves (it had to be melee so that they didn’t get targeted by heart of frost while stacked and ice blocked). This involved a WW, 2 DKs, and 2 Demon Hunters. We practiced the 8 second break in phase 1 and 2, and felt that it would work. The strategy involved these melee getting blocked during Jaina’s Arcane Barrage in a Blizzard (Full Power), and then kicking Jaina the instant they got Frozen Solid. This avoided them being hit by Arcane Barrage, and avoided the phase 3 mechanic Shattering Lance from spawning on them. All the while we had lust up and we burned the Tide Elemental. The timing was such that if it all worked and lined up correctly, Jaina would Ice Block instantly then exit her Ice Block to start phase 3 with 5 melee having reset their stacks, and the Tide Elemental (plus its 2 small spawns from its death) being killed. The follow up to this strategy was to get the rest of the raid intentionally ice blocked in the first Ice Fall of Phase 3. Ice Fall does hit quite hard, but we thought we could cooldown through it, have the group of 5 melee break them out, and commence the rest of the fight with mostly no stacks, and dead water elemental, and the boss at 20%. We never did phase 3 clean enough to see this strategy through as it required precise Blizzard/Storm timing, and many other things to go perfectly right. By the end of the night we even started experimenting with Ice Blocking the boss twice to skip 2 Orb of Frosts in a row (this is probably what came to bite us later!)<br />
<br />
In doing all this, we started to figure out how Jaina’s Ice Block interacted with her abilities. We noticed that we would actually skip certain abilities, and delay others. For example, she would skip Orb of Frost. To us, this meant that a well timed Ice Block would be essentially neutral in terms of stacks as the 2 stacks you get while waiting for the ice block on Jaina would be cancelled out by the stacks you get from Orb of Frost. Near the end of the night, we figured out some interactions that eventually led to the strategy that we killed the boss with.<br />
<br />
* The boss would not Ice Block more than once a minute.<br />
* The troll racial reduces the duration on the Chilling Touch stacks allowing you to drop your stacks during the second intermission around killing Nathanos’ Ice Block<br />
<br />
<br />
That night we devised an offsetting lust strategy that involved lusting all but 1 person in the raid 2 minutes before we pull Jaina, and then ice blocking Jaina to start phase 3, and then having 39 seconds of lust on the whole raid to burn Jaina. So essentially, we eventually landed back on a burn strategy, just that it was slightly different than Method’s.<br />
<br />
<br />
Day 6 (Monday)<br />
<br />
This was our last hurrah, but because of the troll racial discovery we were actually very confident that we could land a kill. Our entire raid aside from paladins and demon hunters race changed troll, and we entered the raid with a strategy that we were sure would work if executed correctly. At this time we started raid as far as I remember Method had a 10% pull with their burn, and it looked like they had plenty of room to improve on that. We still thought that it wouldn’t be enough for them however… By the end of the day I think they improved to 8%.<br />
<br />
When we got into phase 3, it was clear that Bliz had changed Jaina again and made it so she didn’t skip Orb of Frost in her Ice Block anymore (all of her abilities now delayed instead of some being skipped). This hurt our strategy, but it would still be possible. We had numerous pulls that got as low as 10% (and in these pulls we definitely had the damage and healer cooldowns to kill the boss in time, but in each pull we wiped to a mechanic in phase 3). It was apparent at this time that Method had definitely passed us in progression as their phase 3’s were much more clean than ours, although we had had more phase 3 reps. This fact is what hurt us most; we did not work on the mechanics in phase 3 to make it consistent due to continuously flip flopping strategies earlier on.<br />
<br />
We ended the night in defeat, having never been able to make it cleanly past the Siegebreaker. Every time we successfully suicided the Siegebreaker (if the target dies, the Siegebreaker will not go off), we would die to some other mistake. We went 2 hours later than our normal raid time this night, but eventually admitted defeat as our pulls started getting worse as people got tired. We had missed our chance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tuesday Re-Clear and Beyond<br />
<br />
On Tuesday Method killed Jaina while we were on a break at Opulence. Suffice to say, it sucks to lose, but tilt doesn't last. To the winner goes the spoils, Method out played us and we were sad. I’d like to think there is no bad blood between our guilds, because at least in the officer core we have nothing but respect for Method. Maybe Naowh leaving Method to join Limit, and joking with Gingi on twitter caused a rift? I don’t know. That night our pulls on Jaina were promising and we had many 8% pulls<br />
<br />
Although we had publicly stated that we were taking 2 weeks off for this tier, the next week and our re-clear was still going to be strained as some people had to start going back to classes or work. This manifested itself in only doing 9 pulls in 5 hours on Wednesday (raid was supposed to start at 10 am). This was not like Method’s long breaks which were likely useful… we already had our kill strategy and were just waiting for 20 to be available. Anyways, we killed the boss with only Lipp alive in a bubble and nerd screamed just as hard as if we got world first.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Retrospective<br />
<br />
No matter how hard we get memed for coming in 2nd* (3rd) place, we still had a ton of fun this tier. There is no way any guild has a better environment and community as us, so our spirits are all still high. Legitimately there is never any drama or flaming that goes on in our raids. Raiding progression in Limit even to get beat in the end is a huge high for everyone here, and that’s all that matters.<br />
<br />
Like I said earlier, Method outplayed and out prepared us. We will keep working to get better. On our pulls from Monday we were at 402 item level, and Method killed Jaina the first week at 406. This is not meant to be an excuse, but I mention it because allocation and attaining item level is just as important as any aspect of progression. This also meant however, that we could not possibly just copy Method’s strategy. Well played to Method, they truly are incredible and this loss just makes us want to beat them next time even more. <br />
<br />
For myself, I probably won’t be able to take time off of my job to go as hard as we did this tier again, but I am confident that Limit as a guild will still try in some capacity. Raiding here has been by far the most enjoyable thing for me in this game, and that sentiment is publicly shared by nearly every member of our guild.</div></div><hr />

I meant more like &quot;I dislike MSI&quot;. I can easily admit that I am that guy who goes &quot;nobody cares about world first in a video game&quot; since I really have no benefit out of it. I wouldn't just say nobody cares because people care, I just don't get why do they care but okay. In my opinion, I cannot care about something that I am not in direct relation to. I can care about working towards to have that direct relation if I want to but I don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. More like &quot;fat men looking like fat men looking like fat women&quot;... that's more accurate. The scars and wrinkles actually look good but the eyes, lips and cheekbones are quite over the top. They should have toned that down a bit. These faces look way too contoured. Especially the faces 2,3 and 5. Not even the female ones have such defined look.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, in order to make up for this, they will need to spend the next few expansions without adding in new races, but keep adding in more faces (as in more than one face) and other additions.</div></div><hr />

WoW still is the most successful MMORPG, nothing even comes close, thats why they've all gone free to play, ESO, FF14, SWTOR &amp; Wildstar all went free to play cause they failed at holding a playerbase using the subscription model. <br />
<br />

Still, I like the male faces, although they're very similar from each other. In any case, this is what happened with every other allied races (Zandalari for example have only 2 &quot;differently&quot; structured faces out of the 5 or 6 options, the rest is just about the scales).</div></div><hr />

They also have some slight changes in the eyebrow and nose shape. But I think they should make those differences greater to further make the faces look different.</div></div><hr />

WoW still isn't free to play cause they have millions of subscribers til this day. Even if its just 1 million subscribers thats hugely successful for an MMO in this day an age of free to play games and games as service that don't have sub fees.<br />

I haven't seen highly trained warriors wielding swords as big as themselves and running for miles at the same pace no matter what, period.<br />

<br />
Incredibly lazy. It's just like the Pandaren faces who have no variants at all and just different coloring patterns.<br />
<br />
I agree. Different face options should mean different faces, not slightly different wrinkles or scars. Every single character model in this game suffers from same-face syndrome. Make each option noticeably different, and then add different options like scars or wrinkles, or moles.<br />
<br />
And for christ's sake separate the &quot;face&quot; and &quot;eye color&quot; options, it's been 15 years.</div></div><hr />

They only just invented Blood Elves having 3 faces that are the exact same of the old ones, but with golden eyes. I think we'll need another 15 years I'm afraid, dadgar...</div></div><hr />

oh good to know, but i think it gets the point across more on the rest of the body, that weight lifters dont look like body builders...<br />
and a weight lifter, would for sure get a beer belly if they sat on their ship drinking all day when not working.<br />

All the exact same faces are pathetically lazy. It's bad enough on other races, but the KT male face is so distinct that it's really obvious it's the same for everything. <br />
<br />
Still not a fan of the female KT model AT ALL. It's the most boring and dull model in game, with no personality at all. I know she's mean to look like a badass with the face scar, but it just looks like a frumpy dinnery lady got too close to the frier.</div></div><hr />
