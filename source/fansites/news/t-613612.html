Naxxramas available for testing in an upcoming build<br />
Naxxramas should be available for testing very soon on beta servers, and it will include loot ! As a reminder the known drops from Naxxramas are : <br />
Naxxramas 25 Trash Loot 2H Mace (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/august/lootupdate/naxxramas_02.jpg) (2H Mace)<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
All these items have been datamined on beta servers recently but just like any item in the beta they obviously can change. <br />
The trash has indeed been adjusted. Highlights include:<br />
<br />
Longer trash sections between bosses ( to Patchwerk, to Razuvious, to Faerlina) have been toned down.<br />
Heigan gauntlet is no longer a gauntlet, now there's a very small one AFTER Heigan.<br />
A few new creatures have been added in a couple places.<br />
Newer models for many of the creatures.<br />
Some of the trash encounters have different numbers of creatures for 10 and 25 player modes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One other thing...<br />
<br />
Naxxramas should be available for beta testing soon in both 10 and 25 player flavors, including loot! <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Retribution<br />

Tanking in WotLK and Feral DPS<br />
[...] Believe me, if we ever hit a brick wall where we just can't make druids work without parry, then guess what will happen. [...]<br />
<br />
Agreed. As far as scaling is concerned, we've made great efforts to scale abilities so that upgrading your gear doesn't totally change their effectiveness. Here's the problem with Feral druids: because they have so few stats (in the sense that e.g. parry and spellpower aren't important to Feral), it's easy to focus on those stats. If those stats scale really well, then we run into problems where druids can either hit the caps or get such high numbers that the content starts to break. Once druids hit the armor cap in BC, they could start improving dps stats which would eventually have overshadowed other tanks in both mitigation and threat. When they stacked agility, agility and more agility, it just improved their tanking and damage really quickly.<br />
<br />
Warlocks were in a pretty similar situation with spell damage. They wanted almost nothing else and kept stacking the same thing and pretty soon they outstripped similar classes.<br />
<br />
From a design point of view, the challenge isn't making druids amazing tanks and dps. The challenge is preventing them from getting too good too easily. (Note, mean old Ghostcrawler is not saying we're trying to keep Ferals really weak. Just remember that while your goal as players is to get as good as possible, ours as designers is to keep you in proportion to other classes.)<br />
<br />
Is Mother Bear as effective at level 80 as it is at level 70? Yes. Does it scale with AP or armor? No. Does getting AP and armor still make you a better tank? Yes. Will you spec out of Mother Bear when you reach a certain gear plateau? Unlikely. Until recently, Sunder Armor did not scale. It was just crappier the better your gear became and was less effective at generating threat as everyone else's threat increased.<br />
<br />
As to cats, we don't know yet if their dps is too low or not. We should have a better idea soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9336581469-talk-more-about-druid-items-please.html))<br />

Aspect of the Viper Changes<br />
We're going to be changing it so that procs/hits restore a % of your base mana each time you hit, rather than base it off your actual DPS/damage. While the return of mana based on your actual damage numbers do make the ability a lot of fun (at least I thought so!), it has bad scaling issues. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/9336460263-aspect-of-the-viper-change-yea-or-nay.html))<br />
<br />
Silencing Shot interrupt effect<br />
Yes, it should interrupt now. If you find it not working please report so in the bug forum. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/9336583139-silencing-shot-interrupt.html))<br />
<br />
Lock and Load<br />
It should proc from Frost and Snake traps, I'll have QA look into it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/9336673151-suggestion-lock-and-load.html))<br />
<br />
Expose Weakness<br />
Expose Weakness is more of a group utility talent than &quot;backbone&quot; of the Survival Hunter's DPS. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/9336503358-blue-where-have-you-gone.html))<br />
<br />
Bugged Hunter abilities and Master's Call<br />
We did a major bug fixing pass recently, a lot of the bugged talents and abilities should be fixed in an upcoming build (including Master's Call). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/9336502883-bug-masters-call-doesnt-work-at-all.html))<br />

Guardian Spirit cooldown removed<br />
Oh, and we did remove the global cooldown from Guardian Spirit (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/9336583152-bluedeveleper-attention-on-priests.html))<br />
<br />
Divine Hymn<br />
Divine Hymn is intended to be PvP utility and an emergency tool in PvE. Accidentally pull 3+ mobs? Hit Divine Hymn, they all fall asleep, and you have some time to get your bearings and set things up. I don't think it will become that useful until you start doing more challenging dungeons/heroics, though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/9336582384-havent-seen-much-feedback-on-divine-hymn.html))<br />
<br />
Any and all mobs can be afflicted by Divine Hymn's effect unless they were specifically intended not to by the encounter/raid and dungeon designers. <br />
<br />
Broken Talents and Naxxramas raiding feedback<br />
I feel ya on the broken talents, these are all working in my local build which should be public very soon. Don't worry too much on talents being broken as why you feel the class is not &quot;polished,&quot; no talent should be broken or not working when we're finished.<br />
<br />
By the way, I did Naxx 10-man the other day as Discipline and our tank didn't notice any reduced threat with Divine Aegis (with around ~30 spell crit) or Power Word: Shield. It probably did lower his threat, but it was pretty minimal and it definitely wasn't an issue for us. Against a hard hitting boss/mob you hardly even get to see the visual on the tank. One lame side effect is that because a good portion of Disc Priests &quot;healing&quot; is through absorption mechanics, you don't really see that in a healing meter, though that's kind of a side issue. Our tank was excited by how much he was absorbing with Divine Aegis/Power Word: Shield though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/9336583152-bluedeveleper-attention-on-priests.html))<br />
<br />
Developper Q&amp;A (full version (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/9336583152-bluedeveleper-attention-on-priests.html))<br />
Well, something specifically I'm concerned about is Guardian Spirit. Can you comment if there are any planned changes for it? Compared to other 51-point talents for other healing classes, Guardian Spirit feels very lackluster.<br />
I think our fail Rogues would of died a lot more on the Heigan dance without Guardian Spirit. It has a lot of uses, and we currently like how it's has a choice/decision in when using it instead of &quot;just hit it every time it's up.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/6/9336583152-bluedeveleper-attention-on-priests.html))<br />
<br />
Inner fire still has charges. Why?<br />
Keeping the charges mechanic. There are glyphs, talents now that increase the number of charges. I've discussed this in length before. <br />
<br />
Divine Spirit: Possibly the only raid buff in the game that requires 23 points. It's not a great talent and it's not clear why we still need to invest in it. Make it base, but keep an improved divine spirit in the tree. Spirit is becoming a major stat in WotLK and it should have an accompanying buff.<br />
I see players point on this post-raid buff revamp, but for this expansion it's likely going to stay a talent. <br />
<br />
Shadow Resilience: Would it be completely overpowered to just make this a flat 2/4% damage reduction to everything?<br />
Unnecessary, talents have stat budgets and that is going over the budget. <br />
<br />
Improved Fade: Why, oh why, do we still have this talent? It's been around since release and it seems like its only purpose is to immediately point out bad players.<br />
It's good with Improved Shadowform now. Other than that synergy, I see the argument that it could be better.<br />
<br />
Shadow Affinity: Is another effect going to be attached to this talent? Every other aggro reduction talent in the game has a secondary effect. Maybe attach dispel protection to this talent?<br />
Been thinking about removing the Shadow dispel chance from Silent Resolve and putting it into Shadow affinity instead. But in the end that really wouldn't change very much. <br />
<br />
Blessed Recovery: Broken; refreshes on noncritical hits (via procs from resilience), and the healing is nominal even without this problem.<br />
Agreed this talent could be better. <br />
<br />
Holy Nova: Now practically useless with the downranking change; not enough healing, not enough damage, party-limited. Needs focus or a unique mechanic. This ability will virtually disappear from priest specs in Wrath if it isn't addressed.<br />
Agreed, could improve this spell somewhat. Not an easy one. <br />
<br />
Improved Mana Burn: 3 second Mana Burn is pretty much useless in both PvP and PvE these days. This talent is required to make Mana Burn PvP viable, so it doesn't really improve Mana Burn at all. <br />
Fine with this talent. <br />
<br />
Surge of Light: It's a nice soloing talent, but given that Discipline is now the tree that scales with crit, its placement is odd, and it does nothing to buff your healing ability. Adding Flash Heal to the instant cast proc would make this talent quite worth it, even in a Holy build which isn't focused on crit.<br />
We've talked about that specific idea before, but not sure the tree needs instant cast flash heals right now. <br />
<br />
Blessed Resilience: It's not clear that this talent provides enough PvP survivability for a deep Holy build, at this point. But I suppose that remains to be seen.<br />
It's always been better than Focused Will IMO, it's just that the tree is less popular because of the lack of Pain Suppression. Guardian Spirit can act as a Pain Suppression replacement now, and the tree can hold it's own in PvP. I think you'll be seeing a diverse mix of Holy vs. Disc Priests in PvP from now on (hopefully). <br />
<br />
Silence: Somewhat outdated, the cooldown and range are prohibitive. A very modest decrease in cooldown (~5 seconds) and/or a standard range (30 yards) would be a welcome update.<br />
Not a big issue. We'll think about it, maybe a Glyph. <br />

Developper Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/9336801184-dear-devs-want-prot-pvp-to-be-viable.html))<br />
Also - and here's my #1 concern as a tanking warrior... Our threat scales very, very, VERY badly. If we outgear an instance, we're next to useless.<br />
More dps will definitely help -- it generates a lot of rage. But we're still looking at granting more rage based on dodge and parry too. As far as your threat scaling badly in the endgame content, more dps and AP scaling on things like Sunder and Conc Blow will help with that too. <br />
<br />
Why do you feel this Tier 9 talent is any better or different than what we have been doing with intercept and intervene? Managing the rage is easy for both of those so please don't go down that route.<br />
It's up more often, provides a stun and generates more rage. Warbringer will generate rage. Trust me.<br />
<br />
Can you confirm that we'll be able to do this without having to switch gear?<br />
Yes. That is the goal. Prot pallies too. You won't be doing as much damage as an Arms warrior, but you shouldn't be standing around wishing you had enough rage to have fun. You will likely also keep your shield on when soloing, though some warrirors do this on Live. To be honest, I am a little nervous that when we next do our tests, Prot's dps is going to be higher than Arms. That's probably overkill, and you might laugh at the thought, but that's the degree of changes we're talking about. (And we would certainly readjust if that ends up being the case.) <br />
<br />
Paladins cant heal without changing gear. <br />
They can't keep a MT up like a Holy paladin can. But the design is to let them do something when they aren't tanking. The situation should be much better in Lich King (while still making sure Holy healing &gt;&gt; Prot healing). <br />
<br />
That's the point, if I'm reading Ghost correctly she's implying that all 4 tanks should have backup options when they don't have to actively tank, so that they aren't useless when their mob dies. Ferals and DKs are already able to switch to effective DPS pretty easily, and Ghost seems to be saying that prot warriors (and I assume prot paladins) should be able to as well. I'm just trying to make sure that this means mid-fight, otherwise the DKs and Ferals have a big advantage in multi-mob bossfights. <br />
I'm not saying you can bring 6 tanks to Naxx and kill Saphiron. But if you have 2 tanks and go to a single tank fight, the other tank should be able to do something other than skill up their trade skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I love the prot changes so far. The new vigilance is going to stack some REAL NICE threat on me, in combat charge sounds cool but i'm not sure how viable it is. I wish the shockwave ability was dispersed in a 180degree zone, rather than the 30-40degree cone it is now though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The change to Viper fixed basically every major problem that raiding Hunters have been facing since TBC and will, thanks to this change, face in even greater force due to the inability to chain-chug Fel Mana Potions to simply keep ourselves running.<br />

One shot which pierces armor which really isn't even used that often because it doesn't scale, it's highly costed, and is not workable in BM rotations (usually the only spec that Hunters raid as save one SV Hunter).<br />

Well the new wording might mean that the talent now only affects block that comes from the shield itself rather than all block you get from items and stats which would make it a substantial nerf.<br />

also they already prove several times that testings on their &quot;local servers with local builds&quot; are extremely long, highly innacurate, or both, for example, it took 2 hours for shaman comunity during one ptr change to figure out how bad will be reducing casttime fo LB and CL by 0,5s for elemental dps, it took them more than month to figure that on theyr own servers and after &quot;internal testing&quot; and shaman got hotfix in last second before patch went live, so eleshaman dps basically stopped scaling at early BT level of gear</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand it could just be a rephrasing that makes no difference at all.<br />
no, it's the practically the same thing, damage increase and absorption always come after all the gear and stats, it just means shield of righteousness won't get shit from it</div></div><hr />

No it's a pretty big nerf. In the beta a lot of prot pallies were stacking crazy str and block, and then doing a ton of damage with Shield of Righteousness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
blah screw afflic. :/ I hate specs that can't optimize their rotation. (I.E. have to juggle different DoT timers.)<br />
<br />
I want more warlock utility. It's pitiful compared to most casters.<br />
<br />
And Hunters will be fine imo. Shittons of buffs headed your way. And I doubt raids will be &quot;all BM + 1 Surv&quot; now, blizz has put a lot of effort into redesigning each tree to be viable.<br />
<br />
How can you complain about DPS when steady shot/other shots won't clip your autoshot, they get DPS from your ammo, and all the talent changes to make different stings viable?<br />
<br />
Not to mention the pet changes/talents. I'd think you'd be especially happy with that as a *BM.*<br />
<br />
