First, let's start with a short blue post from Hortus. Basically the 2.2 is full of new music and sounds to keep you busy in Inns while you are not playing (hopefully because you're alt tabbing on this site) (Change list is Full recap of 2.2 changes) 
 Yes, there is new sound in many Inns throughout the world.

wobbles pointed out on the forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=483.0) that the RSS feed of the site sucks, and I totally agree with him. The feed was previously limited to 255 characters and it wouldn't show many infos about the news in your favorite RSS feed reader. I pushed this limit to 4000, I hope this will be enough. (Reminder : News RSS Feed is here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?type=rss;action=.xml;board=2.0;sa=news;)).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-07-18, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">but but, the old inn music was my fondest memory, was one of my favorite retail release memories =( when I first entered the Gallow's End in Brill and listened and turned my speakers up and enjoyed the atmosphere..<br />
<br />
This patch will be the harshest blow yet if they remove that music =(</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming the latter is Booty Bay, Ratchet, and boats, though I did not verify this in-game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jytra</div><div class="date">2007-07-18, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, they probably just enabled the music that has been in the game files since the early BC beta. This included new music for all taverns (remixed with a full ensemble of actual instruments to match the area), and new music for certain locations (i.e. Temple of the Moon in Darnassus). I'll check it out when I'm back at my own computer and see if that's the case.</div></div><hr />
