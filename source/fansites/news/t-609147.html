With the original news (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=9138.0) reaching more than 1500 comments, I'll assume that a lot of people are interested in the teaser currently running on official sites, here is a little explanation for all of you who don't understand what's happening. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashscreen4_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/splashscreen4.jpg)<br />
<br />
The splash screen<br />
This is the most obvious part of the teaser, a huge picture of a block of ice slowly cracking to reveal what seems to be a face. Each day a rune was added to the ice.<br />
Day 1 - The first rune looks a lot like the one found on the Lich King swords in many official artworks. <br />
Day 2 - The 2nd rune is the Hel Rune from Diablo 2<br />
Day 3 - The 3rd rune is the Protoss Symbol found on the Starcraft 2 official site (http://www.starcraft2.com/features/)<br />
Day 4 - The 4th rune hasn't been identified yet, and what looks like the eyes of the lich king appeared in the center of the ice crack. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The &quot;hidden&quot; artwork<br />
If you check the CSS File (http://us.media.blizzard.com/232309/master.css) of the page, you'll notice a few commented lines pointing to image links. <br />
<br />
/*.tundra {background:url(_images/04.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br />
/*.cold {background:url(_images/16.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br />
/*.cavern {background:url(_images/15.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br />
/*.icy {background:url(_images/23.jpg) no-repeat 0 0} */<br />
<br />
There was a few theories about these pictures, people tried to replace the number of each pictures with letter to see if it would form &quot;Diablo&quot; in the end but it didn't work. Obviously there are many links between &quot;icy&quot;, &quot;tundra&quot;, &quot;cavern&quot;, &quot;cold&quot;, and Wrath of the Lich King / Diablo 2 and we can't confirm anything based on these names. <br />

Conclusion<br />
Blizzard is having fun and posts a few things from each one of their game just to keep people interested and you'll just have to wait for the WWI to get the final answer. (You've been waiting for Diablo 3 for years, it's not like 2 more days will kill you right ?)</div></div><hr />

Doubt it. There's pretty deliberately a huge announcement, per quotes from Rob Pardo. Blizzcon tickets have never been a big deal.<br />
<br />
We're getting a new game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that could also include a lot of Blood Elf sanctums in WoW too. Which is a good answer, but not sure if they match the rune enough.</div></div><hr />

Knowing Bibi ... he probably has some inside info and knows it long before people started with &quot;Screens Runes Speculations Rick Rolling&quot; He did say Paris's Blizz HQ Is Close to him anyway (Not that it matters) But he has info... he allways does... hai Bibi... hows ur lawyer doing? ^^</div></div><hr />

well, the color on size don't fit the lich king either...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
also im not sure it would be diablo 3 as that would most likely interfere with their plans for starcraft 2. also, diablo (fire), teaser (ice).<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard means a huge &quot;Ice Storm&quot; which could explain the frost teaser...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vakir</div><div class="date">2008-06-26, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm always confident. <br />

<br />
So then you know something...?<br />
<br />
&gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
Damn you.<br />
<br />
At any rate, much as I think it is, I think Diablo should've died when the team left. I'm sorry, but Blizzard needs to stop taking things seriously. That's why I enjoy Warcraft more. They're too inconsistent to ever deliver an engaging &quot;lol epic!&quot; dark fantasy story to me.</div></div><hr />

top down view of an arcane sanctum (mentioned here) - which would stand for warcraft 3<br />

and<br />
<br />
a symbol for pluto (planet), which has 3 moons (like in the rune) of which one is named Hydra (Project Hydra) - which would indicate a fourth franchies.<br />

another interessting fact I read in some forum was that the filenames of this fluffy purple thing are all numbers of the mysterious code from &quot;Lost&quot;. so blizzard might only having some fun with that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kolky</div><div class="date">2008-06-26, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys seen this theory?<br />
<br />
<br />
This is probably just a coincidence, but i'll throw another theory into the mix.<br />
Using the image numbers as sperate digits, and applying them to their corresponding css class names to get the letters, using 0 as the first letter in each word you can get 2 letters per day.<br />
<br />
Tundra - 04: T, R<br />
Glacier - 15: L, E<br />
Icy - 23: Y, I<br />
Cold - 16: O, L<br />
<br />
Knowing that there will be 4 more letters, you can create TYR_EL I_ LO__<br />
<br />
With the The Valenzetti Equation (http://en.lostpedia.com/wiki/The_Valenzetti_Equation) from Lost being 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 which so far fits the numbers we have, the final result can probably be guessed to be<br />
<br />
TYRAEL IS LOST<br />
<br />
So then, 08 will be Artic, giving us, A from 0, and T from 8. Leaving us with 42 something like _ _ S _ S??</div></div><hr />

Not only is Pluto itself too small to be classed as a planet, but the two outer satellites are tiny (Hydra being the larger of the two is estimated to 61km diameter, compared with the over 3000km of our own moon). Simply put, Hydra has way too low mass to have it's own satellite.<br />

And Pluto not being a planet (it's a dwarf planet) and one of the moons having another satellite (which I haven't found any information btw, if have some would like it :)) is a problem for the 4th &quot;rune&quot; representing Project Hydra?<br />

<br />
I have just read a bit in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moons_of_Pluto and found no problems for this theory.<br />
<br />
The satellite with it's own moon is in the splash screen. Look at the enhanced images and you'll see that the third orb has looks like it's got another orb with an orbit line going around it.<br />
<br />
Pluto's Hydra is too tiny to have enough gravitational pull for it's own satellite.</div></div><hr />

In my opinion, it's just probably some piece of ice around or something from the background. I see the rune as a circle with 3 satellites and their respective orbits.</div></div><hr />

And we already have the same info about Starcraft 2.....If it isn't Diablo 3 then it's got to be some new game, which wouldnt make too much sense seeing that they could capitalize heavily from a Diablo 3 release.<br />

Why is everyone ignoring this?<br />
The things posted here are no just speculations or theories about the teaser. These guys are saying it's gonna be Diablo 3, no doubt, and they are sure about it. Their sources must be very reliable for them to post something like that. <br />
<br />
It's gonna be Diablo 3. <br />

<br />
<br />
true. warcraft diablo starcraft hydra. so? this doesnt say anything. forgot the runes already!<br />
<br />
maybe the 5th rune will tell us something of interest but for now we cant get info out of them<br />
<br />
hydra theory: one of the satelites got a subsatelite. waynewaynewaynewayne ok mayb hydra is to small but why do you guess hydra gopt the satelite?<br />
<br />
btw .. all the &quot;planets&quot; or great balls of ice around the subsatelite got very low gravity aswell. in the right distance there could be a satelite for EVERYTHING if no greater force is pulling it away. and, pluto and its satelites are very low gravity sources. in my opinion it could be possible for a moon to have its own moon.</div></div><hr />

I loved D2, but it wouldn't be &quot;right&quot; to release a sequel, and a prequel? Tristram before the knowledge of existance of evil below them...<br />
<br />
+ releasing D3 would seriously put a dent in WoW's income... <br />
<br />
about the battle.net domain, afaik battle.net's sitemanagement was casted away to a third party. + ofc this could be remnants of old database entries.<br />
<br />
and then there's the thouroughness of blizzard, if the forum thing is true... they wouldn't make a mistake like this.. <br />
<br />
I think ppl focussing on stuff outside the blizzard splash screen are thinking wrongly... <br />
<br />
the evidence at hand reveals either:<br />
- WoTLK trailer coming;<br />
- SC2 trailer coming (eyes could also be those of zeratul?);<br />
- SC2 new race?<br />
- WoTLK new race?</div></div><hr />

show me where?<br />
<br />
in the end: it would be not right to do D3, so new game could then ofc be a &quot;new game&quot; ..spin off of a new series?<br />

No offense, but I think there's like 300 people here, and I'll be<br />
ripped apart by 8000 people there [at the Invitational] if I<br />

<br />
<br />
possible but very risky with some big players on the rise in the MMO business.<br />
<br />
If they lose players to &quot;the new MMO&quot; and this &quot;new MMO&quot; isn't all that...they might lose the players even further.<br />

Diablo didnt die in D2..<br />

yeh you raise a good point,<br />
<br />
I &quot;hope&quot; it's related to WotLK then .. seriously if they release D3 I'm losing all respect I had for Blizz, 'cause then it's just blantly milking the franchise.<br />
<br />
I might not even go for SC2 just out of spite (altho that's like THE game I'm looking forward to)<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
:o ::)<br />
<br />
if that penguin have more than on head... it will be a Penguin-Hydra^^; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well... Im not Jessica Fletcher but maybe every rune simply rappresent every franchise:<br />
WoW, Starcraft, Diablo, Warcraft... <br />
<br />
The last one? Rune of Paris... Rune of Blizzard... Rune of Hydra? :D<br />
<br />
For me, the Project Hydra is only the code name for Diablo III... <br />
Hydra/Hydro --&gt; Water opposite of Fire. <br />
<br />
... and an icy theme not only rappresent only Lick King but also &quot;Blizzard&quot; himself!<br />
<br />
But at the moment Im sure about 3 things: there isnt J.J. Abrams under this, I will be in Paris tomorrow and the new game will be reveal only saturday... not before^^ <br />

<br />
For anyone who's only played WoW and knows little of the other Blizz franchises the ice, lich kings eyes, runes etc probably all point to WOTLK and maybe this is what Blizz is aiming at. But, in the next few days, maybe it will turn out to be diablo's eyes and a reference to hell freezing over, etc, etc. So they kill 2 birds with 1 stone - all the Diablo fans are wound up at the idea of a new game due to the cryptic clues and all the WoW people are wound up at the thought of a trailer/release date and Blizz cashes in on both. <br />
<br />
I mean, a lot of the references are extremely cryptic and vague: For example, 'Tundra' can be both Diablo and WOTLK. Blizzard are smart, they know people are going to be reading into every little tiny thing, which is why they hid the purple thing in the .css. I'm pretty sure Blizz knows that some people will immediately conclude Wrath from this, some will immediately conclude D3. It being able to be either or would seem to suggest both games are getting attention at the WWI.<br />
<br />
Either than or it's World of Barney. /shrug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
but as far as i see, there are only three possible explainings that explain all of the four runes<br />
<br />
1.) when the small circles on the fourth rune really are the small circles from the three others, it still means, that they announce/present their three current projects (Starcraft2, Diablo3, Wotlk)<br />
<br />
2.) but, it coul as well be seen as it is drawn, they will bring a next gen mmo which connects all the three universes ( ::) )<br />
<br />
3.) the last possible explaining deals with &quot;next gen mmo&quot; as well, perhaps they want to show their existing franchises (the three runes) and now add a fourth rune which represents the new franchise<br />
(the only reason i have to doubt this is that pic that was postet here and shows how the small circles from the three runes fit on the fourth :S )</div></div><hr />

I was reading the wiki about Blizzard http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_entertainment.<br />

I was scrolling down and was reading where they had a live action movie under development and such.<br />
<br />
From what I read, it had a projected release date of/in 2009.<br />
<br />
This whole teaser thing may be a poke at a release/trailer for it possibly.<br />

Just thought i'd share that, although it's probably unlikely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1st Rune - Frostmourne (Wrath of the Lich King)<br />
2nd Rune - Hel Rune (Diablo 2)<br />
3rd Rune - Protoss Rune (Starcraft 2)<br />
4th Rune - ???<br />
<br />
Blizzard's famous franchises were created in the order<br />
<br />
Warcraft, Diablo, Starcraft...<br />
<br />
The symbols chosen seem to represent the current status of those franchises which would lead me to think that the most logical answer to what the fourth rune is a new franchise. From what people have said, it looks like it may represent the so called 'Project Hydra'.<br />
<br />
The problem comes if there is a 5th or maybe even 6th rune...<br />
<br />
Also, it's two more days, yet to reveal more would give away the character, unless we don't know who they are...</div></div><hr />

<br />
look at the order of images released:<br />
<br />
day 1: only 1 rune, the warcraft series<br />
day 2: rune 1 + rune 2 -&gt; diablo rune<br />
day 3: rune 1 + rune 2 + rune 3 -&gt; starcraft rune<br />
day 4 -&gt; unknown rune<br />

I was thinking the same, in my opinion that would justify it as a Starcraft announcement, and the eyes could very well belong to Durans &quot;hybrid&quot; race. This would also explain the protoss rune, and the ice would then fit the fact that boralis is an ice world, and that is where the hybrids were being developed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Makes sense to me... There have been no indications it is anything other than WoW besides wishful thinking IMO. Heck even the Icy Splash Screen is only on the Blizzard and WoW pages and mysteriously absent on the other game pages.</div></div><hr />

It would make sense after the realse, to give a sneakpeak on a new dungeon, but now it makes no sense at all, as the major character connected with WoTLK is Arthas atm.<br />
<br />
Also, they wouldn't bother making such a hassle only to say &quot;Hey guys, Malygos is now awake! Woot!&quot;, that would disappoint a lot of people.</div></div><hr />

Most of all I don't see Blizzard announcing a new game at this point with SC2 and WotLK on the way. So if ice = WotLK then the not-so-human-eyes could be a dragon. Besides, if they are going to pull back the curtain on WotLK then why not show all of the major villians?</div></div><hr />

It is just a splash screen, I don't think it can be all revealing so it doesn't bother me if it has a new twist. The real juicy stuff with be with the cinematic that gets released.</div></div><hr />

&quot;So you want me to announce the game before our announcement?&quot; he said. &quot;No offense, but I think there's like 300 people here, and I'll be ripped apart by 8000 people there [at the Invitational] if I pre-announce it - but it's going to be really exciting.

I'm convinced that this is the clue to the rune we are seeing now.<br />
But why this old game? whats the thing behind it. There is an other game that blizzard didn't compleetly finnished in that time. it was a RTS game, the world was destroyed and there was only a handfull of people left. When you progressed to the game you would find old technologies and you could incorporated them into your own civ. I realy need to look up those old magazines.</div></div><hr />

I'm nearly 100% sure all this has no meaning at all, the runes represent games, the fourth one might as well be there to make us wonder what it is, making the whole thing even more complicated.<br />
<br />
The numbers are clearly an easteregg too, probably Samwise or someone from the art team came up with an idea which went something like that: &quot;Hey guys, i just made a hilarious art - a violet penguin lolz! How about we put it in some spot in our database, and give those guys that try to figure out what this teaser is all about even more job to do? Oh, oh! And i recently watched Lost, man what a great show. They had those numbers here you know - creepy. Maybe we'll make something with them aswell&quot;<br />

<br />
Return of the Xel'Naga.<br />

<br />
Yes, that's it. Some wise words in this ~2k Comments :O<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for me, i'm hoping for something WotLK related. I'm not saying it is gonna be that and i don't know if it is, but i hope we at least hear something about WotLK, whether it be a release date, beta date, the cinematic, w/e.<br />
<br />
Those eyes do look very obvious. They may not be Arthas, they may not be Diablo's/whoever. They could be part of another character from any of Blizz's games, e.g. Sargeras, K'J (Why it would be K'J, i don't know). But, i guess more will be revealed tomorrow.<br />
<br />
<br />
More will be revealed tomorrow? Lowl. The last 3 Days we thought this! And today its something new what fu*ked our Brains.... and tomorrow it will be the same, because 1 day is left than, and one more information is missing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Something else: Don't know, if someone post this today, but you can see something like a 5th rune.<br />

<br />
The Korean Blizzard WWI was about Starcraft 2... They did a similar trick with a timeline leading up to the event then. Yes there will be news about extraneous stuff but the point of this teaser is the main announcement at the Paris WWI, and they usually only egg the fans on when it's a game announcement.<br />
<br />
I think it's the official announcement of what Project Hydra actually is (and yes, that could mean it's D3, but we aren't certain). There are a couple of hints this is something we don't know of and a couple of others that connect it to 'Hydra' in some way.</div></div><hr />

I loved D2, but it wouldn't be &quot;right&quot; to release a sequel, and a prequel? Tristram before the knowledge of existance of evil below them...<br />
<br />
+ releasing D3 would seriously put a dent in WoW's income... <br />
<br />
about the battle.net domain, afaik battle.net's sitemanagement was casted away to a third party. + ofc this could be remnants of old database entries.<br />
<br />
and then there's the thouroughness of blizzard, if the forum thing is true... they wouldn't make a mistake like this.. <br />
<br />
I think ppl focussing on stuff outside the blizzard splash screen are thinking wrongly... <br />
<br />
the evidence at hand reveals either:<br />
- WoTLK trailer coming;<br />
- SC2 trailer coming (eyes could also be those of zeratul?);<br />
- SC2 new race?<br />
- WoTLK new race?<br />
<br />
<br />
All 3 soulstones were not destroyed. Baal's still remains. <br />
<br />
Further, you're ignoring Pardo's own comments on there being a new game announcement. To put this kind of hype into a game we already know about would be rather pointless.</div></div><hr />

The answer is 42.<br />
<br />
For those of you unfamiliar, in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy science fiction books, the answer to life, the universe, and everything is simply 42. The problem is, the question is unknown. You can read more on it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_Life%2C_the_Universe%2C_and_Everything . While we might not know the question to ask, we do know the answer is 42.<br />

it's completely in sync with release dates... <br />
<br />
just the question is... is this on purpose? or do we misread the runes?<br />
<br />
<br />
What release dates? The D2 Rune was up after the Frostmourne rune. Frostmourne wasn't around until at least WC3, after D2.<br />
<br />
If you count the 4th rune as being relevant to Pax Imperia, would that be a reverse order of the latest titles in each series? However, the 4th rune's link to Pax is tenuous at best. The orbits are not very similar, just the fact that there ARE orbits.</div></div><hr />

http://www.muffinhost.com/files/7/Judge.gif<br />
(Yes it takes some time to load, be patient)<br />
Splash picture was gotten from first page here, the two others from google..<br />
No color adjustments(other than loss due to saving as .gif), no modification. The only thing i have done to the pictures is scaling them so that they would fit.<br />
<br />
I have to say i though it would fit best with WotLK, but after i did this I think im leaning more to the diablo side..</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry guys but if it was they wouldn't include the other references to games (like the clear indication of Starcraft 2). It just doesn't make sense from any perspective.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hehe... People still making 10000 of theories.. Guys.. in 13years i never saw blizzard making something like this is his mother site just for a silly announcement of something already existing like a release date of WoTLK (They even never made any release date of any game in past) or something about a WWI that don't need nothing like this.. <br />
<br />
Each time they did a teaser like that it was for a new game.. maybe the most of you didn't saw the last 1 they made for annunce STARCRAFT2.. but in that 1 too.. they made the story of ALL theyr games.. so.. all runes here can be a refer to all theyr games it's normal.. :)<br />
<br />
Now.. the chances of this new can be few.. <br />
<br />
- DIABLO3 is 1... but i'm not sure .. why they should hit theyr own WoW with another RPG make people leaving 1 for another?<br />
- Do you forgot about that lost STARCRAFT GHOST??? becareff.. there is high chance it can be it...<br />
- Some months ago.. Blizzard announced that they was making the MOVIE of WoW! with the Legendary Entertainment (See 300) well.. There is a small chance it can be the Announcement of theyr even FIRST MOVIE! ;)<br />
<br />
- Last Chance.. i readed about people making 20000 silly theories about every such of incredible things hide in this paint.. ok.. we know blizzard like to joke.. but forget for a moment things that can be hide.. and take apparences.. What is the last work BLIZZARD is working off that we are all in? WOFTLK... and it's about Ice Stuff.. ok? so.. this is the ICE Breaking into the Sky! for reveal something new to us! don't you think about this? <br />
<br />
the last completely new brand game Blizzard made in order was Starcraft.. after it all titles have been about a name already out.. i mean Warcraft = War1, War2, War3, TfT, WoW, BC, and now WoTLK / Diablo= D1, Diablo2, LoD / Starcraft= S1, Brood War, Starcraft2<br />
<br />
.. ok.. don't you think about about 13 years or so.. that is the time for a COMPLETELY NEW NAME in blizzard house? this won't surprise me.. but well.. i just can't wait for saturday like you!!!<br />
<br />
BET!!! ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeh... and that makes a diablo game..how? ... <br />
<br />
Diablo 3, the ...baahl...game... <br />
<br />
Diablo 2 facts (meh fuck spoiler warning):<br />
- You destroy in game the Mephisto soulstone, granting you a shitload of gems;<br />
- In the ending movie of 2 vanilla, the old man talks of killing the beast and destroying his stone;<br />
- In the ending movie of 2 LoD, Tyriel basicly destroys the corruption from the worldstone.<br />
<br />
if it's Diablo 3, it will have a majorly corny beginning<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Further, you're ignoring Pardo's own comments on there being a new game announcement. To put this kind of hype into a game we already know about would be rather pointless.<br />
<br />
<br />
not ignoring, just didn't know at the time<br />
<br />
but still what he said didn't directly imply a new game..that's just what you guys make of it... (called wishfull thinking)<br />
<br />
<br />
What release dates? The D2 Rune was up after the Frostmourne rune. Frostmourne wasn't around until at least WC3, after D2.<br />

<br />
as someone else already replied: the franchise order is exactly en par with the rune release order..<br />
<br />
first a warcraft rune -&gt; warcraft series started 1994<br />
then a diablo rune -&gt; diablo series started 1996<br />
then a starcraft rune -&gt; starcraft series 1998<br />
<br />
4th rune.. might not be pax imperia related indeed..<br />

blizzard page -&gt; eyes have no pupils<br />

The answer is 42.<br />
<br />
For those of you unfamiliar, in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy science fiction books, the answer to life, the universe, and everything is simply 42. The problem is, the question is unknown. You can read more on it at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Answer_to_Life%2C_the_Universe%2C_and_Everything . While we might not know the question to ask, we do know the answer is 42.<br />

we're speaking in franchise terms...<br />
<br />
the &quot;warcraft&quot; franchise started before the &quot;diablo&quot; franchise...and so on <br />

and that's 100% en par with the runes<br />
<br />
<br />
tbh I don't expect a new rune tomorrow...if there's no rune tomorrow...you can be 100% sure the info released is about the 4th one (and just as sure about it not being warcraft/startcraft/diablo related, well ok: maybe a spin off of one of the 3 franchises, but not directly related, like same universe other plotline, you know like &quot;ghost&quot; tried)</div></div><hr />

I think if my product was in market A and there was a large about of users in market B that was a similar market, it would be good to make an ad campaign that exists only in market B to promote market A. Not saying that's what it is, but something to consider.. :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jkleckne</div><div class="date">2008-06-26, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Being a Diablo fan for as long as I can remember, I've been trying to piece together the clues for the past few days since it beats actually doing work. While I never watched the show Lost, it helped seeing some people bring up the possibility of the &quot;Lost Code&quot;, numbers 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, and 42.<br />
<br />
So far, 4, 15, 23, and 16 have all come up, and here is a possible interpretation for their meaning, for those who don't mind some (or a lot of) speculation:<br />
<br />
04.jpg, named Tundra - letters T and R <br />
15.jpg, named Cavern - letters A and N <br />
23.jpg, named Icy - letters Y and I <br />
16.jpg, named Cold - letters O and L<br />
<br />
<br />
Now here is where the speculation really begins:<br />
<br />
Taking another &quot;cold&quot; word (and assuming that we need the letter 'e', for reasons evident when we arrange the letters), we can get:<br />
<br />
08.jpg, named Freeze - letters F and E<br />
<br />
Leaving, by my estimation:<br />
<br />
42.jpg, named ??? - letters U and D (mud.jpg would work here, as would several others - figured I'd post this as opposed to randomly guessing this to death)<br />
<br />
Now all of this is a word game, and for those who don't enjoy a few guessing games, by all means wait until Saturday, as all of this is more than likely wrong.<br />
<br />
But if we rearrange the letters I've laid out to the advantage of a Diablo fan, we get:<br />
<br />
I FOUND TYRAEL.<br />
<br />
I'll take that distorted logic as a sign that at least there's a little hope for WWI!<br />

Hell StarCraft II will cut into WoW's income, but WotLK will bring people back. Diablo III wouldn't be for a while anyways so they'd have plenty of time to continue to grow. If it's project Hydra then that would be awesome too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dfjdejulio</div><div class="date">2008-06-26, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea but we wouldn't be excited if it was WOTK related.<br />
<br />
<br />
We don't know that yet -- what if it's something about WotLK that's as shocking as &quot;eredar and draenei are the same race&quot;, or &quot;alliance is getting shaman, horde are getting paladins&quot; were?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what that would be yet, but I can't rule it out.<br />
<br />
Additional hero classes at launch? Parallel release for consoles? Some new mechanic around the Achievements infrastructure, which the public is only aware of now via people breaking NDA (and which is not general knowledge yet)?</div></div><hr />

That's 10 years ago, so why would it be so sure that it's Diablo?<br />
<br />
I believe that they'll announce upcoming games and WOTLK beta/release!</div></div><hr />

Lasted updated on the 17th of this month.<br />
<br />
I doubt a release date, they never do release dates. And they plan on getting it out by the end of the year just no exact date.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dfjdejulio</div><div class="date">2008-06-26, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's more than one game. Why the hell are people arguing that only THEY are right about it being ONLY D3/WotLK/SC2/&quot;Hydra&quot; when they will probably be announcing more than one?<br />
<br />
Hm, let's run with this... what could they announce that relates to more than one game?<br />
<br />
You know how Sony has more than one MMO, but they offer a plan where you pay one monthly fee to get full access to all of them?<br />
<br />
Well, imagine that they are going to announce D3... and it's pay-to-play for advanced online components... and a pay-to-play online tournament service for SC2... and that one monthly fee will get you full access to both of those plus WoW.<br />
<br />
Likely? No. But possible!</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you just zoom out a bit you can see the whole picture<br />
<br />
it turns out that the lich king is actually a female.... who'd of thunk it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah i'm not that good @ English.. sorry.. ;) but i think you got my point anyway.. <br />
<br />
Something new is coming in the Blizzard's sky through the ice of Wotlk.. 8)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 4th rune represents Project Hydra, and is made up of parts of the other 3 runes (as shown previously in the thread)<br />
<br />
WotLK Open Beta?<br />
SC2 Release Date?<br />
Diablo 3 Announcement?</div></div><hr />
