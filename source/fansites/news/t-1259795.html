<br />
Yep, a 2 min magic dispel (which Holy Paladins can already do every...8 secs, I think) is totally going to fix us in PvP. It's not like our issues were anything to do with the most costly/demanding self-buff in the game at the moment, or all our attacks hitting for average damage, or our burst having huge cooldowns and easily countered whilst having low sustained damage.<br />

Changing the Mage talent from blazing speed to ANOTHER damage reduction? NO FUCKING THANKS! There are already too many useless talents in too many places on all classes that are some kind of damage reduction. It's like they took talents from being utility/boosts to &quot;hey, if you pvp you'll like these widespread AoE roots/dmg reduction/etc!!&quot; Between Mage armors, temporal shield, ice block and alter time there really doesn't NEED to be yet another dmg reduction.<br />

I wish they would do away with talents...they were lame enough to begin with; and now they're even worse.<br />

Take a tranquilizer or two. This is replacing the glyph, which did the exact same thing, which every single PvP and PvE hunter took. Every. Single. One. So nothing's changing from 5.1, except hunters now have one more choice for major glyph slots.<br />
<br />
Also, Hunter's Mark works for all hunters, no matter whose is applied. It's always been like this, so it doesn't matter whose overrides whose, and never has.</div></div><hr />

It's just a rectangular, pixelated panel that shows an accomplishment, it's not going to bite. This game is about setting goals, and something to show for it is always a nice thing. <br />
As for Normal feats, well, not everyone cares about heroics. A vast majority of guilds get plenty of joy out of just killing normal bosses with friends.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fewer and more meaningful Feats over too many insignificant Feats, such as clearing (gasp) the normal modes. As someone else put it well, what's next, LFR feats of strength?<br />
<br />
Normal modes should reward an achievement, but I don't see how anything &quot;Normal&quot; is FoS-worthy.<br />
<br />
- to put it one way, I'd rather have FoS mean something and fail to earn it, than have all of them be meaningless.</div></div><hr />

More focused on the fact that the FoS have changed from HEROIC kills of the 3 end bosses, to NORMAL kills. It's a waste of space b/c clearing T14 on normal before T15 is in now way a FoS, it just shows that you raided T14 past LFR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They didn't &quot;change&quot; anything, they added equivalents of the Cutting Edge FoS for normal modes, big deal. It's not like we don't already get FoS for opening christmas presents or just logging in during the wow anniversaries.</div></div><hr />

Until 4.0 there used to be a MM talent called Improved Hunter's Mark that … well … improved the Hunter's Mark. So it was important whose mark was the active one. If I remember correctly there was even an issue that an unimproved mark would overwrite an improved one.</div></div><hr />

Wait what I missed that, there are not supposed to be any thunderforged tier tokens. Even if there are, Blizzard doesnt want players to be done gearing out before the end of the tier. The developers current plan is to bringing back gear upgrades in the second half of the tier to get players to continue to grind VP in order to get a leg up in the next tier just as they did with this past tier. The developers dont want players who beat the game to take a break. It is good for shareholders, bad for players in terms of burn out.</div></div><hr />

That's a bit nitpicky in this context. While true, and I considered adding extra conditionals to my statement, I decided it wasn't particularly relevant to the issue of automatic application being such a huge problem to the poster I quoted (as there was no automatic application when that talent existed -- in addition to this automatic application just being the conversion of a mandatory glyph to a baseline ability).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Want to know what's ironic about casuals? Most of them say they hate elitist raiders, yet anytime you try to whisper them for a raid invite to pug something, they expect a thorough background check, your ilvl, the names of your children and your pets and proof that you've cleared the instance. And when you pass all of that bullshit and finally pull the boss, the group wipes on the first try and disbands. GG. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, you get a Feat of Strength every November for simply logging on because WoW came out almost a decade ago.<br />
<br />
Second of all, if you guys have the Heroic Feat of Strength for at least Will of the Emperor, why do you even give a shit? You have &quot;Cutting Edge&quot; to separate yourself from the &quot;Ahead of the Curve&quot; folks. <br />
<br />
If anything this a good recruiting tool change. How many times have I asked someone what their raiding experience was, only for them to tell me &quot;I've done all available content&quot;, ONLY TO FIND OUT that they killed -Normal- Lich King in August of 2012.<br />
<br />
Third, what is wrong with making people feel good about their accomplishments? Not everyone is a Heroic raider, and the community on MMO-Champion is a vast minority. A lot of raiders in the world would simply be satisfied with full clearing normals. Those kind of people don't log onto MMO-Champion because they don't care about the game as much as we do. This is a nice bone thrown to those people.<br />

Its Blizzard - they are stopping item inflation on rep gear so they can add extra lvls on random drop gear ! <br />

In other words... they dont know what they are doing atm. So many issues coming up and end of March is coming in to fast for them to get the patch out before end of first Quarter so they can say the game has not lost 1 million subs.</div></div><hr />

Gear catch up for alts etc maybe? You do know that it will most likley not cost Valor right? (Justice or Gold most likley).<br />

Valor gear is behind Shado-Pan Offensive Rep (which you get from killing raid bosses).<br />

Yeah, I can´t believe they released it onto live like that.....oh wait....<br />
<br />
Seriously, people really need to take an IQ test, or some type of anxiety medication before they read PATCH NOTES!!! The mods here should just read previous comments and use javascript to prevent certain people from seeing patch notes on this site. <br />
<br />
Half the people can´t figure out if something is a nerf or buff, and the rest of the people can´t figure out that this is the first patch pass they have done with most of the itemization.<br />
<br />
Please, if your IQ is too low, step away from the patch notes.<br />

Really Blizzard? Why do you support this shit?<br />
<br />
...really? Exaggerate much? It's an achievement. This is what's wrong with gamers these days. Some random dude in an internet game gets a little blurb of text attached to his account/character and people scream bloody murder saying it's &quot;elitist&quot;... LOL<br />
<br />
And just because some random asshat online might act like a dick and brag about his achievement (like in the example you've shown) it doesn't mean it's Blizzard's fault. By your logic, if I insult someone with the in-game chat, Blizzard should remove all form of text communication from the game, because surely they're &quot;supporting&quot; that form of behavior? Give me a break.</div></div><hr />

So, is it that important that you get a FoS for doing a normal raid at the time it's current content? Didn't people whine and moan that no one can see they did MC when it mattered, or any of the other old raids? Well, now you can forever show that you did a raid when it mattered. Normal or heroic doesn't make a difference. In fact, I would applaud an LFR version as well, just to show you actually played when it was current, no matter how easy it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the thing, what's the point of so many achievements? Just one achievement (with date) for clearing the instance, and one FOS (with date), for clearing the tier on heroic mode before the new tier. Sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
Then there's other FOS for things - like logging in every year (which is fine), and also stuff that you did in PVP while it was current.<br />

The moment i saw those horns and their shape and fire i thought demon horns ( sure dragons have horns and spit fire but meh) , and with talk of a burning legion next expansion, tho' not confirmed, and the huge threat that wrathion talked about when we first met him. He might be working with the burning legion. I think he said that that crown will be like an eye, letting him see what's going on. What if he's not the only watching? DUN DUN DUN!<br />
<br />
Or.. OR.... It's part of a boss encounter in Throne of Thunder as has already been established.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I know it's PTR patch notes, and they're subject to change and all that before hitting live, but I would have figured they would have put it in right away at the 522 ilevel so as to provide upgrade options for 5.2 raiders. I mean was dominance/shieldwall gear always 496 in PTR patches, or did it start off as 476 and then get buffed to 496 for live? As if this were to go to live as it is now then everyone would be reliant on LFR/Normal/HC RNG to gear up. If the gear did stay this ilevel then add in some non-rep bound BoE gear (say 476 ilevel) that can at least provide an outlet for valour points.</div></div><hr />

This community is awful. It really is. 90% of the posts so far on this thread are whiney crybabies having a fit over the smallest thing. And I'm not even exaggerating - people complaining about FOS's? About minor tweeks to classes? About fixing abilities that are currently worthless? About giving Hunters something for free and allowing them to choose another glyph - from a Hunter?<br />
<br />
Seriously. Calm down. Behaviour like this is why I haven't bothered to renew my sub yet. You're almost as bad as the League of Legends crowd now!</div></div><hr />

The wow community has always been bad and gets worse year by year. I mocked the hunter changes because they love to fix minor things like a fetch glyph that no one gives a shit about. And yes a free glyph slot is fine but makes no overall difference to the class. When issues such as the state of mm is brought up they just gloss over it or any of the other prevalent bugs. <br />
Time spent on minor bugs such as fetch glyph should be 0 until major ones are resolved.<br />
<br />
I love that GC still pulls shit like this:<br />
<br />
Hunter<br />
there aren't many changes to hunters in the 5.2 patch notes so far, would I be wrong to assume MM won't get the buff it needs?<br />
The change buffed MM's damage. Can you explain how far you think they are behind with the change? (Raidbots can't answer this.) (Source)<br />
<br />
..then says.<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
At the highest RNG, Fire is okay. On average RNG, Fire sucks, and by sucks, I mean it's ridiculously low.<br />
Raidbots suggests the standard deviation of both specs is pretty close. (Source)<br />
<br />
I will back something if it makes sense and I'm not being treated like an idiot, which in the case of wow they do that a lot. It's been this way for years, I'm not the type of player who wants his class to be lol OP but I do like to see shit get resolved and not fobbed off with some minor crap like a glyph change.<br />
<br />
I am sorry I don't jump around the place and throw my hands in the air for every small thing they do, after this many years playing I expect a lot more from the game than what is given.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They will always do that because the top tier guilds are the ones that normally find the bugs the quickest, they are getting thousands of people to test their product for free.. that won't stop. If they hire them and do not allow public testing on content such as raids then tbh I see little change as those guild and sites like icy veins will posts videos on how to kill the bosses at some stage anywho. <br />
The top tier of guilds are not effected by these things anymore as they will rape the content so fast regardless of being able to use. I raided high level and have been hitting ptr's since wrath. never bothered tbc.<br />
My old guild during FL's ptr tested the bosses unlike a rival guild who didn't touch it till release.. they beat us by a week with same raiding days/hours. Both high level guilds but testing fights on ptr doesn't always mean your going to do better than someone who has not. It's mearly bug testing and getting an idea of mechanics.. that can change in a heart beat.<br />
Removing public ptr raid testing will change nout, the guild that get world/server first will still get them, other guild will get them the same. If your not doing ptr's and trying for server firsts this does not effect you in the slightest ... if you think it does do explain.</div></div><hr />
