Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
I think the MMOC forums have come full circle by saying is a genius https://t.co/TrXy3xDkTP<br />
It waxes and wanes with the moon. Legendaries are hard to design though. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689149714143428609))<br />
<br />
I wish people would stop bringing up on the forums...he doesn't work on WOW anymore, you idiots - he's not &quot;ruining&quot; you<br />
The clever way some posters found to still blame me is the damage I did is so severe, it is taking multiple expansions to fix! (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689186785197342720))<br />
<br />
what do you think about blizz response about classic realms? I think if enough people want it they should dedicate the resources.<br />
My guess is they are a novelty that will seem awesome for two weeks and suffer from falling interest in two months. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689149996478803969))<br />
Given that, if it was easy to turn them on, it would make sense, but it's far from easy. Those servers don't exist anymore. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/689150161151365120))<br />

You serious? A fantasy movie where the orcs aren't auto bad? And could maybe be allies? That 'new take' on orcs (if done right) could blow up the sales just as it did back in the late 90s, early 2000's. The mainstream public hasn't seen that angle yet orcs are always the villians. I really stress if done right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, yeah. I mean, it is nothing new. I am not sure to hate it or like it because it is basically &quot;I want that wolf mount but i want it with different color. How can I change color? :) GET PRESTIGE REWARDS IN LEGION&quot; wtf, seriously...I just want different color.....&quot;. <br />
<br />
On other hand, not sure what Prestigious War Mounts means anyway, since PvP is different in legion (reward wise).</div></div><hr />

Are you serious? If the movie has bad CGI(which this one does) mixed with good CGI and humans the mainstream public will treat it like many other fantasy films that weren't done to the level of LotR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love how people assume a movie is not good because it isn't rated R. As if every rated R movie is a good movie. Sorry, that's totally not true. There are crappy PG-13 movies, there are crappy R movies, and there are crappy PG movies. The key is not in the rating, but what is contained within the story.<br />
<br />
There are plenty more PG and PG-13 movies I enjoy than R rated ones.</div></div><hr />

The mainstream public haven't seen ANY angle yet. To the majority of non-gamers the words &quot;WoW&quot; and &quot;Warcraft&quot; mean either nothing at all or just seem like a jokey kids game. This movie has to be sold to a mainstream audience that will start out skeptical. So for, I'm not seeing it.<br />
<br />
Game playing young people, all of whose friends are also gamers, often don't realize what a small bubble they live in. Don't imagine that the general public gives a shit one way or the other about Orcs. They just want an exciting movie that doesn't look too stupid. I don't think this will be it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warcraft had several things against it from the start - the main one being that it's an adaptation of a computer game. I'm afraid (well not really, I'm very very amused by this) that this movie isn't going to get past that first hurdle.<br />
<br />
If it succeeds at all, it'll probably be after the fact as a little cult niche hit that amuses people familiar with the IP or who are entertained by bad movies.</div></div><hr />

According to an interview with her, she trained with swords, daggers, and sticks. So <br />
I think she'll be fighting with several weapon types.<br />

What a load of crap!<br />
<br />
The biggest private vanilla server has been going for almost a year, the PvE realm has hit 100k registered members, the PvP realm has triple that.<br />
Concurrency numbers are starting to exceed 10-11k regularly making it necessary to continuously update infrastructure.<br />
2 months my ass.<br />
<br />
And it shows no sign of slowing down, if anything the only danger to its prosperity is too much success.<br />

No. It's because people will be more in awe and remember a big flying city more than a generic town full of mages, ala Harry Potter.<br />

Not to mention, it gives it more the reason for orcs to use dragons in the 2nd movie.</div></div><hr />

The biggest private vanilla server has been going for almost a year, the PvE realm has hit 100k registered members, the PvP realm has triple that.<br />
Concurrency numbers are starting to exceed 10-11k regularly making it necessary to continuously update infrastructure.<br />
2 months my ass.<br />
<br />
And it shows no sign of slowing down, if anything the only danger to its prosperity is too much success.<br />
What a wanker.<br />
<br />
It has been said repeatedly that the cost of doing the servers, and doing them for real, with real servers, not MYSQL faking it servers, is way beyond what would be feasible. <br />
<br />
It's bad enough that you guys don't listen, it's how belligerently you don't listen. Do you actually cover your ears and shriek &quot;NAH NAH I CANT HEAR YOU!!!&quot; when you read the comments about why vanilla servers will never be a thing?</div></div><hr />

Lol, Interstellar didn't even use CGI and the amount of CGI used in Mad Max is just a fraction of that they will have to use in warcraft. You clearly have no clue. You are just like all the other haters out there that have nothing else to do but complaining about everything. I am sick of people.<br />
Fuck the MMO champ community. Please dont watch the movie, you should get banned so you never can see it. All you do is complaining. This Movie looks great so far, it could habe been thousand times worse. Who could have imagined 5 Years ago how big this Film project became. We should be excited about it to have that privileg. We should be thankful to have that chance. Im sure blizzard and Duncan did a great job and gave their best. So stop this bullshit and value the privileg we as Warcraft fans have to get such an elaborate movie adaptation, or just shut the fuck up.</div></div><hr />

I guess you didn't feel you embarrassed yourself enough in your first post, had to go a second round? you are advocating for minimalist CGI in a film with elves and orcs and other fantasy creatures, I mean, unreal. &quot;derp let's turn this movie that already might not be great into a real piece of trash so I have more of a reason to shit on it herp a derp.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
When my girlfriend's reaction (she is not a WoW player but appreciates the enormity of the movie and the game to me) to all of the Warcraft [movie] trailers is merely &quot;why does it have such bad CGI?&quot; then I am worried for the general public's reaction.<br />
<br />
We all genuinely want the movie to be a success, but I think it looks like a compromised movie. When we watch a cinematic crafted by Blizzard we are instantly convinced of the authenticity in every frame... whereas with Warcraft the movie we're (I am, at least) left searching for credibility in any frame. *sad face*<br />
<br />
I don't doubt the team behind Warcraft, their WoW credentials are great, but I think somewhere the mark has been lost... or maybe it could never have been hit when translated to a feature film.</div></div><hr />

One of my guys saw the trailer for the movie during the football game yesterday and was like &quot;wow what the heck is this, it looks awesome&quot; and then saw the title. He immediately wanted me to show him the in game character models and such and was very interested in the movie just from a few trailers he saw. The non WoW public will get interested in the movie for all of the hype and Warcraft players will of course see it because we are all hopeless nerds. I think a bigger drive from the movie will be a push for the RTS games to be updated for newer hardware and operating systems which may bring more people to WoW or at least the Warcraft RTS. Either way some of the CGI is great and some of it from the commercial was really bad. Hopefully they re-edit some of those scenes so the orcs dont look like they are on a bad green screen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The biggest private vanilla server has been going for almost a year, the PvE realm has hit 100k registered members, the PvP realm has triple that.<br />
Concurrency numbers are starting to exceed 10-11k regularly making it necessary to continuously update infrastructure.<br />
2 months my ass.<br />
<br />
And it shows no sign of slowing down, if anything the only danger to its prosperity is too much success.<br />
What a wanker.<br />
<br />
its a matter of resource allocation and relative to what they could instead be doing with those resources to drive a better game or profit. 100k registered members doesnt mean much with out a frame of referance. Is that life time? those who have logged in in the last month? unique vistors? all that matters. now, active players is more important from a resource perspective. <br />
<br />
those numbers seem huge, but compared to live wows numbers over all, they are small. even if you consider wow having around 4.5million active subs, 100k is only ~2% of that number (yes i know there may be interest from those who want to play on an official server, but its probably not much larger). <br />
<br />
blizzard has stated multiple times, they dont have the original code. This isnt that far fetched to believe either. Why keep around code from 10 years ago thats not relevant? the code has changed significantly since then and it would serve little purpose. It was also code optimized to run on different hardware and hardware infrastructure than what they run today. there are systems that didnt exist back then that are now integrated into the current code, things like the current battlenet and how the servers them selves are setup and talk to each other (databases, login systems, server shards, etc). so even if they had that old code, they have to now update it to integrate with these new systems to have a product that is up to par with what would be expected of them (the private servers do not have the expectation for obvious reasons). The old code comes with all the old bugs and imbalances. do. do they fix them? do they leave them in to preserve the old experience? what new bugs crop up making all these new systems like modern Bnet work with it? do they even use the same tools or have access to the tools they used to work on the game in the past. this is again, all assuming they actually have the original code even available, which they claim they dont, and we have no reason to not believe them. the private servers function by hacking together and re-writing all the scripts. they are at the point they are at only after years of work. <br />
<br />
doing all of that takes resources, as in money, people, and time. those resources can be used for other projects, its opportunity cost. they have to give on-going support as well. yes, they can always hire more people, but those people have to be brought up to speed and trained as well, and again, they could instead use that payroll else where such as any of thier other IPs, current wow, or a new IP. they need a compelling business reason to do all this, which means gaining a significant amount of new subs or retention of subs that wouldn't already be subbed to the current game, or charge extra to play on legacy servers. if it just cannibalizes the modern game, then it doesn't really benefit them. <br />
<br />
blizzard has made it clear they have no intention of doing this for a very long time now. While they do change their minds on somethings, this is one i really dont expect to ever change as there is very little incentive for them to do so.</div></div><hr />

Just as a reminder, nearly all trailers have awful CGI next to the real movie. Because rendering is never finished 3 years before the movie is out. I remember the very poor CGI and FX from Jupiter Ascending's last trailer (4-5 months prior to the movie ?). Ok this movie was a total failure, but its effects are just wonderful.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I won't even go further comparing a Youtube video on a 20-sthg inches screen to an IMAX movie shown on a 9m-wide screen. I'll wait to see that myself. :)<br />

Oh yeah, it is that easy. <br />
<br />
You conveniently ignore that private servers:<br />
- are run by some shady individuals<br />
- can be shot down anytime<br />
- have loads of bugs (I tried one of more prominent TBC pservers and it was awful)<br />
- have occasional rollbacks<br />
- are full of hacks<br />
- admins boost characters and sell items for money<br />
- your account can be banned for even slightest offense like mentioning name of other pserver or saying that the server is buggy<br />
<br />
Legacy servers would have much higher population if provided by Blizzard itself. When I played retail I've head once or twice that such things exist but never bothered playing one. Back then their selling point was that they were free to play current expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My mind is still reeling from trying to process this statement. Either you haven't seen the movie, or you're thinking of another movie. <br />
<br />
If you have seen Interstellar, and you believe no CGI was used, could you please explain how they shot the following scenes:<br />
<br />
Scenes on spaceships that don't exist, particularly the exterior shots in space.<br />
<br />
Scenes showing a black hole, something that's never been photographed.<br />
<br />
Scenes traveling through a wormhole in space.<br />
<br />
Let's start there.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Bad CGI&quot;, let me be the guy to explain what it means,<br />
<br />
It means it's not blending into the movie, making it an immersive adventure. If you realize and see that it's CGI (too often), it minders the experience. It does not say it's a bad movie overall, but it adds to it.<br />
<br />
Good CGI? The Martian, Mad Max, Interstellar.<br />
Bad CGI? (Hold your breath...3..2...1): The Hobbit (especially part 3) ;) - and yet it was successful-ish.<br />
<br />
CGI is not everything, but something.<br />
<br />
The key to CGI, when it comes to characters, is being able to get an audience to care. Success here is relatively new - they've been doing objects and environments at extreme levels for years, but Gollum was the first time they pulled off a full CGI character that worked. And, one of the few credits I give the Star Wars prequels is while Jar Jar was abysmal, they pulled off Yoda. If anything, the digital yoda really highlights the rubber head practical yoda, watching the original 3 now. <br />
<br />
That's the line this movie will live or die on. They're trying to breathe life into the orcs, and have their performance match the human actors, in the same scenes. Will they do that? Dunno, haven't seen enough footage yet. It might work in small doses, but extended scenes will prove if they pulled it off or not.<br />
<br />
I laugh at the &quot;look at the detail&quot; argument. Detail is important, but it's not all of it. Expressions, body language, body movement all matter, if you want to sell a CGI character. Personally, i think they went too far with orc eyes, made them too human, too small for the bodies they're attached to, they feel weird and disjointed. Maybe others will overlook it. Yoda and Gollum work, because they don't have human proportions in their faces, which makes them more believable as non-humans, but they put all the expression into the features - honestly, a lot of the orcs look like actors with a shit ton of prosthesis on their faces, and it looks weird in motion. (And, I nit pick their voices - no way tusks and lips stretched over them can produce a voice and pronunciations exactly like a human, their language would sound entirely different, and with those tusks? A lot of spit would be involved. Having voices exactly like humans, but doing a Metzen RAWR doesn't do it for me.)<br />
<br />
The environments and objects and special effects look awesome. Great job there. <br />
<br />
I don't really care if the film does well or not. I'm an ex-WoW player now, and I just can't find the energy to have an opinion, other than an objective artistic one. It's all just general movie talk for me at this point. I don't think the movie will win any awards or set any milestones, but it probably won't lose money, either, and my ego isn't attached to either outcome, like a lot of egos here are. It's just a movie.</div></div><hr />

It's one thing to be ignorant. It's another to be willfully ignorant - and arrogant about it on top of it.<br />
<br />
Your argument is based purely in fantasy, to spite someone who disagrees with you, who has presented real, valid reasons. <br />
<br />
We'll see which one comes true. I know what side my money is on, and it's not on a theoretical set of source code. <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way, I think you have a misunderstanding of the issues here. The &quot;source code&quot; isn't the problem. It's the server code. That doesnt exist anymore, but it would have to be rewritten anyway, to work with modern server hardware. It's really hard to do that. Private servers fake it with MySQL. Do you even know what that is, and why it's important? Do you understand how servers work, it's not just a hard drive you plug in and ghost a build onto - they're mini networks across several racks, using custom networking code (and from what I recall custom hardware) so your character can leave the blade Goldshire is one, and enter the blade NAXX is spawned on. And does that for several thousand people, entering dungeons, raids, and areas and battlegrounds. And keeps track of chat, your character, any changes, Battlenet, and can handle up to 20,000 players at one time. See, I'm explaining this to you, so you have to acknowledge that A. you're wrong, and B. you don't know what you're talking about, and C. all you bring to the table is schoolyard &quot;You'll see!&quot; fantasies and bad information. Oh, and &quot;I want!&quot;<br />
<br />
Tell us more about these fantastical &quot;financial analysts&quot; that are furiously combing Blizzard's financial records, trying to justify spending millions to placate a small handful of customers who aren't going to pay for what they get for free right now. Please, tell me more. It's fascinating. What else have they dug up? You'd think they would have by now. Like, recoding Diablo I to sell on their store. Or the old RTS games. Or Rock And Roll Vikings. SURELY these wise, benevolent and tireless searchers would have found all kinds of scenarios to make money by now, resurrecting old projects and code. Or, are you telling us Blizzard has deployed highly trained and paid financial analysts just to justify vanilla servers? Is there a press release you base this on? Or is it mentioned in the corporate report? You seem pretty sure they exist, so it should be easy to point out how you know of them. Surely. <br />
<br />
We'll wait. Everyone, be quiet, we're going to wait for Savras84 to tell us the &quot;Tale of The Mysterious, Wizardly Blizzard Financial Analysts&quot;. It's gonna be a GOOD one!</div></div><hr />

agree would have made a lot more sense.<br />
trouble with bad CGI WOW's been going a long time in various carnations its made Blizz Billions lets be honest.<br />
they left it late enough to even make a movie. A fair number of the community are already pissed by them and when you see some really dodgy Sci-fi film of the week special effects its going to cause a negative reaction.<br />

But you're wrong. Let me explain as I'm a photographer, and cinematographer and play with cameras all day. The film has HDR (high dynamic range) that equalize the human eye, funny thing is since we are used to the poor compensation of cameras until recent years, for some people it will seem off, but actually this is more what the &quot;human eye&quot; will see in terms of light, obviously the &quot;focus&quot; thing is more about the subject in what the brain focuses on than actual focus, at that distance with a great angle, everything will be in focus, when you see it on the big screen since your brain can pick up all the scenes like the VFX shots you think are off, you'll have a different opinion. <br />

100% agree<br />
<br />
I saw it in cinemas, and it looked way better than on YouTube. I also watched it on my TV sitting in my couch ou my bed, and it looked very good.<br />
Of course if you watch it glued to your computer screen, with the compression from YouTube, it will look crappy. But I swear if you look at it the way it's meant to be looked at, it's just amazingly beautiful !</div></div><hr />

I'm by no means a big supporter of Vanilla servers, however... I do think Blizzard needs to consider something.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft is an INAUGURAL Inductee to the Video Games Hall of Fame.<br />
<br />
... The World of Warcraft Phenomenon was the game that existed from 2004 - 2007... it carried on through BC/Wrath, but the fact is Vanilla WoW was a charming, wonderful adventure that, most importantly, was FUN. (I know, shocking how something so &quot;broken&quot; and &quot;unbalanced&quot; could be FUN, right?)<br />
<br />
People SHOULD be able to experience the game as it was. In EVERY OTHER game franchise (or at least 90% of them) you can easily go back and play the old, classic versions of those games. Experience the game for yourself.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, for the simple LEGACY of their game, and what it meant then, and what it STILL means to people now, really need to consider uploading servers with the ability play through Vanilla, BC &amp; WotLK. (Adding support for other servers as more time passes.)<br />
<br />
I mean, look at Blizzard's Catalogue:<br />
<br />
Diablo: You can still purchase and play Diablo II, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. You can still find discs to play Diablo the original.<br />
Starcraft: You can still play Starcraft, and Starcraft: Brood War through battle.net, and you can STILL play SC2 games using the WoL version, HotS version and the current meta the LotV version.<br />
Warcraft: You can still play Warcraft III and Warcraft III: TFT through battle.net. Can still go back and play Warcraft II, Warcraft II: ToD, and Warcraft: O&amp;H<br />
<br />
.... You cannot go back under Blizzard's support and every play WoW as it was. Which is a shame. A crying shame, because World of Warcraft 2004-2009 is simply one of the, if not THE, greatest video games of all time.<br />
<br />

I simply think Blizzard has too much pride in its current games to admit that re-releasing old content would be MORE fun for a LOT of people than their current work.<br />

LOL hell no, no even close. LOL if they even think about doing a move like that u will have everyone complaining that isnt new stuff.<br />
<br />
Plus ppl tent to get the nostalgic syndrome, bc Vanilla, BC and Wrath have thier own issues. And saying the game havent improve on all this time is false. Yeah of curse WoW will not go back to thier gold years, but been still active and pretty much toping Active sub ranking after 11 years, is just crazy.</div></div><hr />

People go nuts over Blizzard CGI trailers usually, they just look amazing and are made so well. This is basically a 90 minute long CGI similar to those... Why all the hate?<br />
This looks just as gorgeous... Really can't understand it...</div></div><hr />

... The World of Warcraft Phenomenon was the game that existed from 2004 - 2007... it carried on through BC/Wrath, but the fact is Vanilla WoW was a charming, wonderful adventure that, most importantly, was FUN. (I know, shocking how something so &quot;broken&quot; and &quot;unbalanced&quot; could be FUN, right?)<br />

People SHOULD be able to experience the game as it was. In EVERY OTHER game franchise (or at least 90% of them) you can easily go back and play the old, classic versions of those games. Experience the game for yourself.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, for the simple LEGACY of their game, and what it meant then, and what it STILL means to people now, really need to consider uploading servers with the ability play through Vanilla, BC &amp; WotLK. (Adding support for other servers as more time passes.)<br />
<br />
I mean, look at Blizzard's Catalogue:<br />
<br />
Diablo: You can still purchase and play Diablo II, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. You can still find discs to play Diablo the original.<br />
Starcraft: You can still play Starcraft, and Starcraft: Brood War through battle.net, and you can STILL play SC2 games using the WoL version, HotS version and the current meta the LotV version.<br />
Warcraft: You can still play Warcraft III and Warcraft III: TFT through battle.net. Can still go back and play Warcraft II, Warcraft II: ToD, and Warcraft: O&amp;H<br />
<br />
.... You cannot go back under Blizzard's support and every play WoW as it was. Which is a shame. A crying shame, because World of Warcraft 2004-2009 is simply one of the, if not THE, greatest video games of all time.<br />

You can replay all the other games just fine by yourself or a small group in your own session. But you cannot just generalise this setup unto an MMO! You have to setup and maintain a server, you will need mods, you will need a critical amount of people who play this setup on a regular basis. It has no use for a Legacy server, if people rush into the server because nostalgia, but drop out as soon as they have satisified their desires and possibly never ever return. <br />
<br />
The most important thing is: You cannot recreate the experience. You will not get your friends from that time back into the game if they have moved on. Your experience is different from back in those days. And you will constantly have to compare the legacy server to your memories, and I bet that the memories would win and leave you disappointed.</div></div><hr />

Your argument is based purely in fantasy, to spite someone who disagrees with you, who has presented real, valid reasons. <br />
<br />
We'll see which one comes true. I know what side my money is on, and it's not on a theoretical set of source code. <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way, I think you have a misunderstanding of the issues here. The &quot;source code&quot; isn't the problem. It's the server code. That doesnt exist anymore, but it would have to be rewritten anyway, to work with modern server hardware. It's really hard to do that. Private servers fake it with MySQL. Do you even know what that is, and why it's important? Do you understand how servers work, it's not just a hard drive you plug in and ghost a build onto - they're mini networks across several racks, using custom networking code (and from what I recall custom hardware) so your character can leave the blade Goldshire is one, and enter the blade NAXX is spawned on. And does that for several thousand people, entering dungeons, raids, and areas and battlegrounds. And keeps track of chat, your character, any changes, Battlenet, and can handle up to 20,000 players at one time. See, I'm explaining this to you, so you have to acknowledge that A. you're wrong, and B. you don't know what you're talking about, and C. all you bring to the table is schoolyard &quot;You'll see!&quot; fantasies and bad information. Oh, and &quot;I want!&quot;<br />

Like you can't do full movement shots of a lot of things. Or you are extremely limited in terms of fantastic looks. Like the Orcs and Uruks in LotR don't remotely look like warcraft orcs. There are just a lot of things in warcraft that can't be done without cgi. The story of LotR (the first one) really serves this purpose of having little cgi. Alle the main characters are very humanish and the settings are not too crazy or in narrow dark spaces where you can make bad cgi look better. The warcraft story is just happening outside on a very big scale with you know war happening. If you want a warcraft movie without cgi or with &quot;mad max&quot; style cgi there had to be a story that is inside one place or something like that. It's just a design decision to go full cgi so that the story of warcraft can be told at all.</div></div><hr />

I love how everyone conveniently decides to ignore my posts. Look back in this thread, this movie looks much better than Avatar and GoT visually in terms of CGI. The story is up to Duncan and he never fails to impress.<br />

Having leveled quite a few toons lately, I think they would have a better product than pure vanilla with current class designs and most current game rules (retain Vanilla mount level requirements) applied to the original Vanilla zones with their multi-zone quests and original AV battleground. At the original exp gain rate, move rates and with plenty of far flung quests, it would make it feel epic again. They could even leave in the 1-60 content for blood elves, squids, worsen, and goblins. With current class versions, many of the huge imbalance issues of the original version will be gone (there are still plenty, just at a lesser differential)... making the whole thing a lot more enjoyable in any class/race combo.<br />

You don't need the budget of Avatar to improve greatly on its ~7 year old tech. Avatar was high-end then, but this movie's CGI has even more detail.</div></div><hr />

The proof of the hardware change is the fact they auctioned off the original server blades. <br />
<br />
Vanilla servers won't happen. And the only way they would draw a crowd is if they were F2P. There is zero money to be made considering how much work would have to go into it.</div></div><hr />
