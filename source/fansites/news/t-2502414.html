<br />
Patch 8.2 Hotfixes - August 9th, 2019<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Azshara’s Eternal Palace<br />
<br />
The Queen’s Court<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug with Frenetic Charge (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/300550-frenetic-charge) which would cause Aspect of the Turtle (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/186265-aspect-of-the-turtle) to not correctly mitigate the damage and knockback effects.<br />
<br />
Za’qul, Harbinger of Ny’alotha<br />
<br />
Reverted a change that caused Mind Tether (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/295537-mind-tether) to deal excessive damage to the linked target.<br />
Corrected an issue where Mind Tether (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/295537-mind-tether) would not attach two targets that were in separate phases.<br />
<br />
<br />
Operation: Mechagon<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that could cause players to become locked to the normal encounter if they killed King Mechagon on hard mode and died at the same time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
The bonus amount of Azerite granted to players with the Azerite Residue buff has been increased based on Island Expedition difficulty.<br />
<br />
Heroic Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
2 Azerite per stack of Azerite Residue, 500 Azerite total per player at full stack.<br />
<br />
Mythic Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
3 Azerite per stack of Azerite Residue, 750 Azerite total per player at full stack.<br />
<br />
PvP Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
4 Azerite per stack of Azerite Residue, 900 Azerite total per player at full stack.<br />
<br />
<br />
Azerite Residue increases in potency more quickly based on Island Expeditions difficulty.<br />
<br />
Heroic Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
Azerite Residue now increments every 1.5 seconds (6 minutes 15 seconds to reach full).<br />
<br />
Mythic Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
Azerite Residue now increments every 1.25 seconds (5 minutes 12 seconds to reach full).<br />
<br />
PvP Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
Azerite Residue now increments every 1 second (3 minutes 45 seconds to reach full).<br />
<br />
<br />
Developers’ note: As higher Island Expedition difficulties award larger total amounts of Azerite, we want to ensure that the reward for engaging and defeating the enemy team remains relevant, especially in PvP Islands.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that allowed certain abilities to remove the &quot;Recharging&quot; debuff from Logic Loops.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
“Taking the Air Out” is now offered more often in Mechagon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Activision Blizzard Second Quarter Earnings Call Results<br />
Activision Blizzard recently had their quarter 2 earnings call (https://investor.activision.com/static-files/0997afe7-22ec-4535-8daa-4a253550b16a) and here were some of the key takeaways on the Blizzard side:<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/thumb/quartertwoearnings01.jpg (https://investor.activision.com/static-files/0997afe7-22ec-4535-8daa-4a253550b16a)<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft subscribers increased since mid-May, following the release date announcement and beta for World of Warcraft Classic and the Rise of Azshara update.<br />
Across Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Warcraft, Hearthstone, Overwatch, and Diablo, they are expanding their development teams and resources so that they can accelerate the delivery of content in the pipeline, pursue new business models, broaden communities, and delight players.<br />
Blizzard had 32 million MAUs (monthly active users).<br />
Hearthstone MAUs increased quarter to quarter following the release of the Rise of Shadows expansion and deeper, more engaging new single-player content in the quarter.<br />
Overwatch MAUs were relatively stable quarter to quarter, with engagement increasing following the release of the Workshop<br />
At Blizzard, daily time spent per player increased year over year.<br />
Overwatch League hours viewed continued to grow year over year in the two stages held during Q2<br />
<br />
Season to date, viewership and average minute audience have grown double digits year over year.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's Q2 net revenue was $384 million. Operating Income was $75 million (20% operating margin)<br />
<br />
Revenues and operating income declined Y/Y, reflecting lower in-game revenues<br />
Operating margin fell Y/Y, with the revenue decline partially offset by lower costs<br />
<br />
<br />

Subs are up thats all that matters. https://i.imgur.com/kAWI91L.gif</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">otaXephon</div><div class="date">2019-08-10, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always enjoy the earnings calls because of the amount of tin foil it tends to produce. Here's my take:<br />
<br />
I still stand by Classic being a retention mechanism though I should add the caveat that the people who are returning for Classic are likely those who purchased BfA already but quit. After all, the value proposition of a subscription that grants access to two games is pretty hard to ignore.<br />
<br />
It's also curious that they mentioned WoW subs at all. I might be mistaken but this is the first time in a very long time that they've been mentioned at all. Of course they didn't provide specifics but it's still interesting that they mentioned it. Clearly Blizzard is still aware that WoW is an important part of their revenue model.<br />
<br />
On that note, Y/Y revenue dropping seems (to me) to indicate the allure of cash shop items has dropped. Of course it's impossible to say with any certainty but we'll likely see fewer cash shop items over the next few quarters as Blizzard looks to find ways to increase revenue without relying on the (imo inherently unreliable) whale/dolphin/minnow model. Hopefully that just means more content. <br />
<br />
Time will tell. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough. (Side note: I strongly disliked Legion as well but if it's any consolation I feel like BfA is more akin to WoD than Legion so maybe check it out?) <br />
<br />
I still don't see Classic as a huge generator of brand new subscriptions or as a way for Blizzard to &quot;gain back&quot; any of the 200M who've played WoW some time in the last 15 years but quit for whatever reason. I'm not denying there will be people who do come back just for Classic but I'm still firmly of the opinion that these players are not Classic's intended demographic.</div></div><hr />

I'm skeptical. If anything Y/Y revenue decreasing means we might see less in the store as it's clear the current model isn't proving to have long term stability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt it's the WoW store being the culprit behind the decrease in revenue (all games are included here), considering it's allowed them to earn more from WoW with fewer subscribers than they did whilst the game had 12 million subs.<br />
<br />
No, they'll be expanding on it for sure. And as long as the game doesn't go F2P, I say go for it. At least I can choose not to spend in the store.</div></div><hr />

Those words come from Blizzard though, since it relates to their games and their revenue and their income.<br />
Like it or not, but Activision didn't give us such half-assed jobs as WoD. Blizzard did.</div></div><hr />

Not necessarily. They've had some really solid success this past year with standalone non-service oriented games. They were resistant to these sort of releases previously, but I wouldn't be surprised to see more games like Sekiro and the Spyro and Crash remasters in 2020.<br />

<br />
Or they just need to refine/change the items or services, possibly changing pricing as well. As an example, you couldn't get me to pay money for that new mount, the alabaster thing. Its ugly in my opinion and I have found very few that love it enough to go buy it unless they already own the collectors edition. If they had made that mount cooler, I would have purchased it, like I do most mounts and pets on the store. <br />
<br />
I think they need to refocus on what they are releasing and not just on releasing anything because we will just buy it. I know I am slowing becoming more selective.</div></div><hr />

That's true.<br />
<br />
Let's revise: The Activision titles are theirs, Blizzard's are theirs. <br />
<br />
Activision aren't the only ones speaking, Blizzard has a hand in and thus fault in anything that's bad about their games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People who play Classic Beta do that because they want. Not because Blizzard &quot;forced&quot; them. I don't give a flying fuck about Classic and Blizzard didn't shot me. I'm still here.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rogalicus</div><div class="date">2019-08-10, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Side note: I strongly disliked Legion as well but if it's any consolation I feel like BfA is more akin to WoD than Legion so maybe check it out?<br />
I'm glad that grind is more tolerable this time, but from what I've seen over the last year (when I randomly watched some WoW content), classes didn't really improve over Legion's barebones state and raids are still based on piling the same old mechanics on top of each other until it's barely manageable. I liked it more when the whole fight was built around some interesting concept.</div></div><hr />

/shrug<br />
<br />
I understand the cynicism but a part of me hopes that there are people at ActiBlizz who understand that players are quickly burning themselves out with the subscription based quasi-F2P model they've been using. <br />
<br />
Actual content is something I think we can all agree would be beneficial to the game and if they're making internal changes to produce more of it that would be much preferred to ... yet another shop mount/pet.</div></div><hr />

I am absolutely positive they made more money off the game with 12 million subs than they do with a fraction of that + some ugly store mounts. With 12 million subs the game was making 180 million monthly.</div></div><hr />

Being a fan of WoW and wanting it to be successful doesn't have to mean that we can't care about the content of the quarterly reports. If anything, they're the closest we get to a factual representation of how Blizzard is going to move the game going forward. In a way, yeah, it's easy to hand waive the importance to us mere internet plebians but the speculation is fun and I generally enjoy the conversation... and isn't that what discussion forums are for?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game never made $180 million a month off subs. That's a very naive interpretation.<br />
<br />
They only hit that playerbase size during a fairly brief window. For most of its lifetime WoW has had well below 10 million subscribers. About half of those active accounts were based in China, where the monetization model was entirely different and revenue was shared with a publishing partner. And not all players were paying $15 a month. Many players were also on discounted 3-, 6-, and 12-month recurring subscriptions.</div></div><hr />

Then you can happily be wrong I guess?<br />
<br />
They've diversified and increased revenue from fewer players. During a bad year in WoD they made 800 million USD (from less than half of the 12 million peak) and the game's profits INCREASED in the years since it saw 12 million subs retained. What, you think they upped the team size between MoP and WoD because they made less money? You think they're literally announcing an increase to the resources put into the game because they expect to make less money or the game isn't making mad profits?<br />

Please. And no, it's not just store mounts. It's a WoW token (Battle.net Balance), character services, pets, now toys, and to be expanded.</div></div><hr />

I don't know their reasoning but you were not forced to do anything. They set the requirement of subbed players having access to the beta. You chose to activate your sub to test.

I don't think you understand what a &quot;cash grab&quot; is. Also, you seem really tilted about this, which tells me that a part of you really wanted to play Classic Beta. So why not just sub and try it out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry but I feel I need to weigh in here. <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to antagonize you but based on all of your responses so far you seem have an expectation that since something happened previously, it MUST happen at all points in the future as well and this is wrong. Just because they may have allowed you to test the betas for previous expansions does not mean they cannot change the standard and require a sub for future things. <br />
<br />
And yes, you are totally correct, they are in fact looking at a group of people that do not play anymore and trying to get money of them for the classic beta. It's because they're a business, and like every business on earth they will want to make as much profit as they can as well as finding new ways to make even more. Business is greed, and the bigger the company, the more greedy they will get (and they don't get much more greedy than Activision/Blizzard).<br />
<br />
For years they tried to stem the tides of people wanting to play WoW as it once was, they've tried for years to stop private servers, all to no avail. I'm sure one day at some meeting or other someone ultimately realized that they could create a larger revenue stream of subscribers by making a classic wow version and thereby bring back some or most (or all if they had their way) of the people that no longer play but instead play on private servers. Its win/win for them. They gain control of their IP again (in their mind at least despite the fact that private servers will most likely never go away), bring back people who want to play under the official banner and make even more money in the process. <br />
<br />
So yeah. you're completely right, they're using you to make more money. I'm completely shocked as to why you can't understand it when you are literally answering your own question in your post.<br />
<br />
I also fully expect them to go against their word and create an in game store as they have in retail which will offer the TCG items, it'll make them a fortune. <br />
<br />
And before the classic purists come in with a defence of *NO CHANGES! I'd like to point out the truly unscrupulous business practices Activision is currently doing in it's Call of Duty franchise by offering overpowered weapons in loot boxes and manipulating the system. All in a game that they're attempting to make a viable and legitimate esport.<br />
<br />
If you're at all interested in what I'm referring to, please look up YongYea on Youtube, he has a recent video on this very subject and you'll see the slippery slope WoW could be heading down.<br />

<br />
For one thing, Classic isn't an expansion. So it's not surprising they chose a different path for trying out the beta. And it's not a cash grab because anyone who was already actively subbed could have tried out the beta without giving any extra money to Blizzard. And folks who didn't have a sub had a chance to resub to try the beta if they wanted to. Both groups of people were the target demographic.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Why&quot; is another question. Maybe they wanted to cash-in on 10 million Classic players (as calculated by MMOC forum experts ofc). Maybe they just didn't want to send beta profiles to inactive accounts from 2005.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's also not a sudden change. MoP was pretty much an open beta for all subscribers only. Most of the time pre-WoD non-subscribers do not get access to WoW beta. Even then, if you were not subbed, you only in if you got an invite. Which was a low % of testers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they knew going into 2019 they had cashflow concerns, already. It's not shocking that they're coming up with new ways to monetize the game, when they knew the influx of classic players wouldn't be until late in the year. What's different about 2019? Oh, yeah - they aren't releasing any new games.<br />
<br />
I'm actually kind of surprised they haven't required a sub for anything on the PTR, honestly. But maybe they know a lot of people use the PTR for a free version of WoW, and they didn't want to have the Classic test be more of that - people trying to play for free, and not offer feedback. By requiring a sub, they know the people there, want to be there?<br />
<br />
But when you take a &quot;Activision Blizzard are evil money grubbing bastards&quot;, everything is a conspiracy, I guess. <br />

<br />
- They beat their expected earnings per share by almost 50%<br />
- WoW has been increasing sub counts since May<br />
- HS has increased player counts<br />
- Overwatch basically stable with no groundbreaking content coming out. More of a holding pattern until OW2 is announced/released<br />
- Amount of time playing Blizz games per player has increased year over year<br />
<br />
I don't really enjoy their new philosophy as a company, but I don't think they're really spinning this...</div></div><hr />

If anything Y/Y revenue decreasing means we might see less in the store as it's clear the current model isn't proving to have long term stability.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how this makes sense. I'd increase items in the store. The production costs can't be all that high and some of the playerbase (collectors) will always buy what you dish out. The production costs would have to be high enough to not justify making them to actually put up less items, but how much can it cost to make a new mount that people pay 25 euros for?<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
and you prove you don't understand.<br />
if you want to play the beta you have to be subscribed to wow. you can't get around it.<br />
<br />
Or you can pretend it's a sub for WoW classic. It's not like you'd get in for free.<br />
Here's why the model is good:<br />
- you play retail and aren't interested in classic: you still have access to classic and might join guildies and friends<br />
- you might want to try classic, but you can't justify paying an extra sub for it: you don't have to<br />
- you want classic and aren't interested in retail enough to pay a sub: you might try out retail<br />
- you aren't interested in the other at all, no matter what: it's no skin off your back, it's still one sub, not two<br />
<br />
There is literally no downside to this model. So can we stop bitching about it?</div></div><hr />

I'd increase items in the store. The production costs can't be all that high and some of the playerbase (collectors) will always buy what you dish out. The production costs would have to be high enough to not justify making them to actually put up less items, but how much can it cost to make a new mount that people pay 25 euros for?<br />
<br />
I'm sure even a mere 100 people purchasing the mount would probably cover the cost of production, and they obviously sell far more than that.</div></div><hr />

You'd have to be a fool to believe it's not the case. Do you really believe the increase in subs has anything to do with retail and not people using up their tokens for a CHANCE to get into WoW classic beta?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haidaes</div><div class="date">2019-08-12, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am absolutely positive they made more money off the game with 12 million subs than they do with a fraction of that + some ugly store mounts. With 12 million subs the game was making 180 million monthly.<br />
<br />
It never made that much, since those 12 million included a gigantic portion of inflated asian pseudo-subs that constited of &quot;someone played during our capure window in an internet cafe for 5 minutes for a pittance of chinese monopoly money&quot;.<br />
<br />
The cost-benefit ratio of store mounts is also astronomical for Blizzard. They cost them next to nothing and they make incredible summs of money off these. Developing content to keep people subbed on the other hand costs them alot and they don't make as much money from it on average.<br />

To a simpleton maybe. Smart people question why.<br />
And &quot;how many&quot;. The statement is true if they just got one extra sub compared to the last earning call..</div></div><hr />

wow gain subs, the game is still dead and it has increased subs for other reasons.<br />
wow stay stable on subs, the game has died caused it didnt gain new subs.<br />
<br />
Why should you even care? you either sub up, play the game and enjoy it. Or you unsub and spend your time playing something else.</div></div><hr />

why all of a sudden do we require a sub to beta test classic?<br />

why was i required to sub to beta test classic but not BFA or Legion?<br />
<br />
Never in the history of WoW have I been invited to a beta of a version of WoW without an active subscription.<br />
<br />
Just because its classic doesn't mean its any differnt than expansions when it comes to testing.<br />
<br />
Not to mention just because in the past they may have invited people to betas without subs doesn't mean they also have to do that.</div></div><hr />
