Working as intended. War Mode is a Horde feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway read IoQ changes carefully. At least Hangar will be more attractive now. Not sure why they increased vehicle HP, seems really weird considering they had already done that. Anyone who plays knows how hard it can be to score a kill on a vehicle without getting instantly zerged to death. Also cannons doing less damage is really dumb, they can be easily countered by lining them, killing them from ranged (forcing players to repair them which is interrupted by damage) or even climbing the tower and killing the people on the cannons. Feels like teams should be rewarded for having the initiative to use the cannons properly.</div></div><hr />

The lack of skip mechanic for this weeks quest line was unfortunate.</div></div><hr />

why transmogs have a level requirement is something beyond my grasp. Like Velerios said, &quot;If it's fun, it's not blizzard!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
DOes completing the quest line have any unlocked content such as World Quests? If not, that is the reason.</div></div><hr />
