Recently, we introduced our new Real ID feature - www.battle.net/realid/ , a new way to stay connected with your friends on the new Battle.net. Today, we wanted to give you a heads up about our plans for Real ID on our official forums, discuss the design philosophy behind the changes we’re making, and give you a first look at some of the new features we’re adding to the forums to help improve the quality of conversations and make the forums an even more enjoyable place for players to visit. <br />
<br />
The first and most significant change is that in the near future, anyone posting or replying to a post on official Blizzard forums will be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their real-life first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character alongside it. These changes will go into effect on all StarCraft II forums with the launch of the new community site prior to the July 27 release of the game, with the World of Warcraft site and forums following suit near the launch of Cataclysm. Certain classic forums, including the classic Battle.net forums, will remain unchanged.<br />
<br />
The official forums have always been a great place to discuss the latest info on our games, offer ideas and suggestions, and share experiences with other players -- however, the forums have also earned a reputation as a place where flame wars, trolling, and other unpleasantness run wild. Removing the veil of anonymity typical to online dialogue will contribute to a more positive forum environment, promote constructive conversations, and connect the Blizzard community in ways they haven’t been connected before. With this change, you’ll see blue posters (i.e. Blizzard employees) posting by their real first and last names on our forums as well.<br />
<br />
We also plan to add a number of other features designed to make reading the forums more enjoyable and to empower players with tools to improve the quality of forum discussions. Players will have the ability to rate up or rate down posts so that great topics and replies stand out from the not-so-great; low-rated posts will appear dimmer to show that the community feels that they don’t contribute effectively to the conversation, and Blizzard’s community team will be able to quickly and easily locate highly rated posts to participate in or to highlight discussions that players find worthwhile.<br />
<br />
In addition, individual topics will be threaded by context, meaning replies to specific posts will be grouped together, making it easier for players to keep track of multiple conversations within a thread. We’re also adding a way for Blizzard posters to “broadcast” important messages forums-wide , to help communicate breaking news to the community in a clear and timely fashion. Beyond that, we’re improving our forum search function to make locating interesting topics easier and help lower the number of redundant threads, and we have more planned as well.<br />
<br />
With the launch of the new Battle.net, it’s important to us to create a new and different kind of online gaming environment -- one that’s highly social, and which provides an ideal place for gamers to form long-lasting, meaningful relationships. All of our design decisions surrounding Real ID -- including these forum changes -- have been made with this goal in mind.<br />
<br />
We’ve given a great deal of consideration to the design of Real ID as a company, as gamers, and as enthusiastic users of the various online-gaming, communication, and social-networking services that have become available in recent years. As these services have become more and more popular, gamers have become part of an increasingly connected and intimate global community – friendships are much more easily forged across long distances, and at conventions like PAX or our own BlizzCon, we’ve seen first-hand how gamers who may have never actually met in person have formed meaningful real-life relationships across borders and oceans. As the way gamers interact with one another continues to evolve, our goal is to ensure Battle.net is equipped to handle the ever-changing social-gaming experience for years to come.<br />
<br />

The ones who don't like this idea like to flame others and start heated discussions and just generally insult people. There are good and bad things about this, clearly. But i believe it will tone down all the negativity that's floating around the wow-europe.com-forums</div></div><hr />

I find this extremely amusing. They actually tried to find a way to solve the crap that happens on blizz official forums. I can't believe it.</div></div><hr />

I got a feeling gold sellers are going to abuse this.

At least make it possible to turn off your last name.</div></div><hr />

Your name is not unique. You are not a special snowflake.</div></div><hr />

CREEPERS GALORE.<br />
<br />
However, reducing trolls and raising constructive posts while making the community more pleasant (theoretically) as a whole is great.</div></div><hr />

Not really sure how this idea will clean up the forums though, you can still post on an alt</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have no concept of what privacy is and what it is used for.<br />
<br />
Wait until you're applying for a job and get rejected because your would-be employer google your name, find out you play wow and denies you the job because he is prejudiced against it.<br />
<br />
Myself I prefer to keep things separate because really the link between who I am in game, who I am here and who I am IRL are informations that people really don't need to know.<br />
<br />
If this goes through I won't stop posting on the wow forums because I don't want to troll there with my irl name. I will do so because I don't want people completely unrelated to me playing wow find out what I post there, how much I post there etc. - knowing that I play wow, knowing what I do in it or how much I play is simply not their business.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, but seriously this is ridiculous! It will only deter me from posting on the forums knowing people can see my full name and do numerous things with that info even as far as to stalking me? or identity theft? GOOGLE is not my friend any more...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">epitaph</div><div class="date">2010-07-06, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few words...E-stalking. Hehe...let's check to see if this alliance rogue has a facebook page...How about online harassment. I'm sure there's some kind of law protecting the privacy of minors...The short of it is this. Since the internet began, very few people give out their real names. I'm not a troll nor a flamer, but I have always used an alias. I like having an alias....it makes me feel like I have control over what my name is and what I'm called.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they're going for quality over quantity. Not saying it's a great idea but I think the pros outweigh the cons.</div></div><hr />

Many people have unique combinations of first and last name, making it easily traceable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because combined with an IP its not hard to get more information about someone. <br />
<br />
And for everyone making a Facebook comparison, people don't add random strangers to their profile.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Solfire</div><div class="date">2010-07-06, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They need to allow us to have a nickname or something. I tell NO ONE my real name. I enjoy giving feedback on the class mechanics of priests and trying to help the priest community. Plus bumping guild recruitment threads or just chatting. No trolling or flaming, but I won't be able to post anything if my real name is on it.<br />
<br />
In fact aren't blizzard GM's required to not tell anyone their real job? I recall reading a post by Ghostcrawler joking about his identity, and about how even his guild didn't know who he was. Now that him, and every other GM will be posting with their real name, they'll be easier to find.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Talk about throwing the baby out with the bath water, sure you will stop some trolls, but you will also stop helpful posters who (for whatever their own personal reason) don't want their real name known.<br />
<br />
I didn't mind realid having my name shown as it only goes to my friends in game, but this will stop all my posting on the wow forums. We have a troll of epic proportions on my main server that has managed to keep playing past several bans (buying new accounts, moving characters, re-rolling, etc.). This is the kind of loser that has tried to track people down before he had access to peoples proper names, don't want to see what will happen once realid names are out.<br />
<br />
Blizz needs to rethink and add in nicknames even if only for the forums. It should be up to them (Blizz) to police us, not each other. They already know our accounts and names, they can stop trolls by simply monitoring and banning any idiots.<br />
<br />
PS - For those who say &quot;it's only a name, what can they do with that&quot;... a lot. Your facebook page, little comments here and there about where you live or location in the city you live, etc. If you are clever enough you can track down people with only a little bit of starter info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um...the purpose of RealID in the first place was for friends and relations to stay in contact with you when playing the same or different Blizzard games. Since when did total strangers get added to the list?<br />
<br />
In one aspect, people won't be posting on their lvl 2 alts they made specifically for the forums, as their name will always be displayed, but what about the good people of the community that don't want their name shown to the world? Why must they get forced into something that isn't needed?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cilraaz</div><div class="date">2010-07-06, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm usually one who argues the pro-Blizzard side of arguments, to the point of being called a sympathist or fanboy. I think this change is absolutely insane, though. If your name is John Smith, you may not care. Personally, I have a (literally) unique name. I am one of 4 living males with my last name. It would not be difficult for a job recruiter, for instance, to look me up and see my interest in WoW. While I don't really care who knows that I play WoW, I'd rather not be turned away for a job because a recruiter has a wild hair up their ass.<br />
<br />
On top of that, Blizzard has said all along that Real ID was optional, and if you didn't want someone to have your full name, just don't add them as a Real ID friend. This kinda defeats that. You want a more pleasant official forum? Create a dropdown box under the person posting with a list of each of their characters on the account (or a link to go to a page to see all of the characters). Right there, unless someone's willing to pay $15 a month to troll the forums on a separate account, the problem is solved.</div></div><hr />

You accept people you trust, and people that most likley already know your IRL name. But the forums? I dont know.<br />
As a female player I rather not go out with my name, and rather not always reveal that I am female in the first place unless I want to. There are still people to take the oppinions diffrently if you are of a diffrent gender. And I rather dont want new &quot;omg-girl&quot; stalkers ingame. <br />

If you set up parental controls on your battle.net account, you can disable RealID, which in turn would stop your whole name from showing up everywhere.<br />

On the flip side, you cant use any real ID features, such as cross game chat...though TBH, I rather not have people I know in SC2 bug me when playing WoW or vice versa.</div></div><hr />

Wait until you're applying for a job and get rejected because your would-be employer google your name, find out you play wow and denies you the job because he is prejudiced against it.<br />
<br />
Myself I prefer to keep things separate because really the link between who I am in game, who I am here and who I am IRL are informations that people really don't need to know.<br />
<br />
If this goes through I won't stop posting on the wow forums because I don't want to troll there with my irl name. I will do so because I don't want people completely unrelated to me playing wow find out what I post there, how much I post there etc. - knowing that I play wow, knowing what I do in it or how much I play is simply not their business.<br />

I'm against this idea. A first name and partial list of characters (80's, most active, whatever), yea, that would be acceptable. <br />

Using my last name? No, that's too far in my opinion. Yes, with my last and first name, you can find me very easily. I realize it's not everyone in the world, but on Facebook, I'm the only one with my name, if that gives you an idea of things.</div></div><hr />

wrong.<br />
<br />
I know girls who have been estalked by people knowing their name. Once you know ones name, you can start associating other personal information with it. Say a hottie in guild chat lets their hometown slip, you then go on battle net, search for their posts and now you know her name AND hometown. <br />

e-stalk begin.<br />

I won't be posting on the WoW forums either anymore, it seems extremely weird to have both the names on the post.

This is absolutely fucking ridiculous. Anyone who can't deal with trolls is either too sensitive or needs to grow up. The internet is a brutal place in terms of criticism and Blizzard making their forums into a long string of facebook messages is going to KILL community activity. <br />

1) Trolls/Immature people will start googling the real name and in case they find something often use that against someone even though it has nothing to do. (e.g. &quot;lol, you're still a student, no wonder you have so much spare time&quot;<br />
2) Whats more important: The forums are indexed by search engines. So basically anyone who knows my real name (collegues, friends, but also my boss, human resources on applications etc) can see what I'm posting in a gaming forum? But not only that, they'll see an attached character name which they then can look up in the armory and see how much time I spend in WoW (thanks to activity feeds). &quot;So, you played a bit WoW when you called in sick? Here's your pink slip. Now clean your desk.&quot; Might be a bit extreme, but personally I like to keep my gaming life and real life apart.</div></div><hr />

<br />
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD WITH THAT NAME.<br />
<br />
Actually, my name is fairly unique. If you Google me I come up. And I don't troll on the forums at all, I barely post there - but I do. not. want. my. name. showing. up.<br />
<br />
First off, when Blizzard first announced the Real ID system everyone balked that it showed your official name you registered Battle.net with. But they said why does it matter? Only your close friends and family should be your Real ID friends anyway, not people online.<br />
<br />
So now two months later it's OK for our names to be plastered over everything on the official forums? No thanks.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure there's a law against this, or if not there should be. You should always have an option to keep your personal information private. Hell, Facebook recently with their whole integration to other sites had some user information set as Public initially and that was a huge privacy shitstorm. This is worse, because you Cant. Turn. it. Off.<br />
<br />
As for Facebook, mine is so locked down that you can't see my pictures or who my friends are if you are not my friend. And that's how I like it. <br />
<br />
And as other people have said - if you Google Warcraft stuff now the official forums come up, a lot. So do you really want potential employers googling you and see that you stay up till 3AM before work playing Warcraft, and reading all your posts? No. And yes, employers absolutely do that kind of thing.<br />
<br />
Basically, I want my privacy. Is that so much to ask? Not only is Blizzard not giving us the opportunity to say no to this, they aren't even giving us an off switch. Ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Really hilarious. I'm not shameful about my real name, nor am I afraid to post under the auspices of my real name. My privacy honestly isn't being breached, because none of my actual personal information - beyond my name, which is shared by many - is being shared.

It specifically says that when you post on the forums your post will show your real name, it will NOT show your character names unless you specifically tell it to. You can post on the official forums and still prevent anyone from connecting you with your characters.<br />
<br />
it doesn't matter... I don't want my actual name out there in public.</div></div><hr />

I'm banned from the official forums anyways, but if you ask me this really won't stop people from trolling if'n they really want to. I mean sure, instead of being Lolforumtrol, a level one troll, you'll be Greg Johnson. It's not like everyone knows which of the many, many Greg Johnsons in the world you actually are. And for many of the people who post on level ones, who are concealing their identity to avoid irrelevant armory reference in a debate, they'll STILL be able to conceal their character if they so choose.<br />
<br />
So yeah, not really that beneficial if'n you ask me.</div></div><hr />

There's some scary people out there. I'd rather my real name wasn't being transmitted to anyone who cares to read a forum without my say so. And yes I have a possibly unique and at least very rare real name. I'd be surprised if there are two of us in my home country at least.<br />
<br />
Solution... (I hope) I'll be changing my name in my contact details. Sure, the mailman might be smirking as I have to sign under 'Zortan the Mighty' for any Blizz purchases but at least some psycho won't be able to google me, and will have to make a little effort to stalk me.</div></div><hr />

If I google my first and last name, about half of the results are about me and the other half about one of my deceased uncle who had the same first and last name.</div></div><hr />

I never troll or flame, nor did I ever feel like it was anything more than a mildly annoying inconvenience to accidentally click a troll thread, read it, facepalm, and go to a different topic.<br />
<br />
It's ok, though; if they really decide to go through with this, I'll can go and delete every single last one of my WoW forums posts. That would take forever, but it's infinitely better than some psycho knowing my name. Do not want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not paranoia. That's a desire for privacy. <br />
<br />
On the internet, that's MORE than reasonable because people can access the wow forums without posting, and they will probably be able to for the next DECADE or so.<br />
<br />
I will not be posting on the wow forums if this change goes through either. <br />

This also snuffs my hopes that they will add an invisible mode to RealID, or the ability to turn off the sharing of your full name to everyone one of your realID friend's friends.</div></div><hr />

Ever heard of deep web searches? With just a first and last name somebody paying for a professional deep web search can get every piece of information that exists about you on the internet. Even things that are hidden from google crawlers is available to a deep search. I have two facebook accounts, one professional and one for my friends. The second uses a nickname to avoid this very problem. Believe it or not there are some employers who would be prejudiced to find out how avidly you play WoW. Applying to EA Games? Think they will like the fact that you spend hundreds of dollars on their prime competitor? Any job with access to a computer, there is at least a chance they won't like the fact that you spend(or even used to spend) hours online playing a game.<br />
<br />
People have lost jobs because their Amazon book reviews showed up on a deep search. What's not to say something similar COULD happen? The fact of the matter is, the less places online your real information shows up publicly, the safer you are. Pure and simple.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, how much of a panic do you guys get into when applying for a job or being introduced to new people. Do you change your names every time a rejection letter comes through the door?

Are you freaking out everytime a salesman calls you Mr BlankityBlank the second you pick the phone up? Are you slapping your friends when they yell your name from across the street? How many of you have 100+ friends on Facebook or Twitter that you have never met in your entire life? Are there members of your own family that you can really trust with your name?<br />

<br />
I'm done with the official forums. I've never trolled there once, only tried to help people. But if you think I'm going to hand out my name to a bunch of petty and vindictive strangers who could be anything from sweet old grandmothers to raving mad serial killers, you are as high as a paper kite.<br />
<br />
And for the record, no you can't find me online. You couldn't pay me enough money to post some of the information people put out there freely.<br />

You have no idea how much about you is just floating out there waiting for someone to find it. Believe it or not, you don't have as much privacy online as you think.<br />
<br />
But the reality is that:<br />
-Most people who have or can gain access to your info don't want it or even care about it.<br />
-Online communication is so commonplace that it should be treated like face to face as far as basic information available and behavior. I mean, we talk to friends and family online, we have business meetings, conference calls, stay in touch with people, meet strangers, etc. We do this all online so much more, stop acting like this is something that wasn't bound to happen somewhere online.<br />
-This isn't the age of the dangerous internet like in the 90s, most people online really don't care who you are enough to help or hinder you, stop acting like the world is out to get you.<br />
-AS far as people talking about future employers not hiring you because of WoW......ROFL. Are you serious? I'm in college for business and I can tell you it won't prevent you from getting hired, unless you slack on your job because of it. We are living in a an age, where if possible boss in under 30, its becoming acceptable to text message them instead of calling, because that's the standard. What if the future boss is under 25, I was told by someone who goes over resumes and helps people find jobs to actually send a text or even send a message via Facebook. What we think about how people see things like hobbies and networking are vastly different than even 5 years ago.<br />
-As for any extreme case of stalking people try to list.....don't care, statistically irrelevant. We could also talk about how knowing a real name could prevent harassment or even help locate dangerous people faster (pedos and serial stalkers come to mind).<br />
<br />
Really, people need to start thinking before they act and think about the general rules and not the exceptions when deciding how good something is. This is a huge improvement that helps FAR FAR more than it hurts. But people will whine about how stupid on unsafe this change will be, but will open a door to a stranger or answer a phone call that they can't see on the caller id.<br />
<br />
I really don't see how this makes it any less safe, going to a bar or club seems more dangerous than this. AS for privacy, like I said, it really isn't as private as you think online, so that's a non issue and a moot point to tear anything down about real ID just yet.</div></div><hr />

Your actual name is not private information, it is already public. What you don't want public is your name being associated with a World of Warcraft post. That's OK, they won't out you publicly against your will. It's your choice whether to post or not.</div></div><hr />

The official forums are searchable by Google. I work in technology. When I apply for a new job, at some point in the future, someone will Google my name. A lot of companies wont think that a heavy WoW poster would be such a great employee. I have a family and other responsibilities... I don't need problems getting a job.

Not much of a Forum poster, I think i have maybe posted twice, but even the idea of a post showing my real name to people I don't actually know, isn't all that appealing. Especially since you can do a google search on people using their first and last name and learn tons about them. It allows people to also badger you on other sites, like Facebook since they can now search you out. It allows way too much personal information to be able to be accessed in my opinion from a VIDEO GAME setting.</div></div><hr />

I for one disagree with this. Not because of the trolling or other crap. I do not troll I find better ways to spend my time. However, I do enjoy reading people getting flamed. Let's be honest, the reason why people get trolled is cause they are being stupid and get called out on it. I hope that Blizzard changes their mind about this. I see a lot of problems coming along with this. It's not hard to find who is the person behind the toon when you have the name you need.

<br />
This exactly.<br />
<br />
They're trying to make the forums a place new players can go to actually learn about the game and not get into endless trolling and flame wars that currently go on. Instead of monitoring for it they make it so you're not anonymous on their optional forums so you're much less likely to do such acts. All the people whining are mostly trolls and flamers who do nothing but take up forum space and are upset they won't be able to anymore without being anonymous. The forums are completely optional, no one is making you post on them and posting is not required in order to play this game. If you want to troll/flame people you have to do it elsewhere now.<br />
<br />
BTW I'm amused reading all the responses on the official forums to that post, so many upset people claiming they won't post anymore. Good riddance.</div></div><hr />

As for Facebook, mine is so locked down that you can't see my pictures or who my friends are if you are not my friend. And that's how I like it. <br />
<br />
And as other people have said - if you Google Warcraft stuff now the official forums come up, a lot. So do you really want potential employers googling you and see that you stay up till 3AM before work playing Warcraft, and reading all your posts? No. And yes, employers absolutely do that kind of thing.<br />
<br />
Basically, I want my privacy. Is that so much to ask? Not only is Blizzard not giving us the opportunity to say no to this, they aren't even giving us an off switch. Ridiculous.If you have your facebook on lockdown then there's no need to worry about the social aspects. If you're staying up until 3 am playing WoW and I was your boss, you'd be damn sure I'd weary of you. I wouldn't want someone who isn't focused on the tasked and hasn't had proper rest.

<br />
I'm pretty sure there's a law against this, or if not there should be. You should always have an option to keep your personal information private. Hell, Facebook recently with their whole integration to other sites had some user information set as Public initially and that was a huge privacy shitstorm. This is worse, because you Cant. Turn. it. Off.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the idea would be that if you don't want your name appearing in google, you shouldn't post to the boards. It certainly isn't illegal to display the name of someone who posts when they ought to know that their name will appear.<br />
<br />
Now if they retroactively added names to old posts, then I would sympathize, but I don't get the impression that this is what they're going to do.</div></div><hr />

I dunno, man...it says you'll have the option of displaying your main character. One has to wonder, though, what dictates a 'main character'. It may mean you can only post on level 80's, but that would exclude new players from using the forums. In all likelihood, it will probably mean you can choose a 'main character' to post on, which means you may still have a level 1 named &quot;Youmadbrah&quot; talking about how your idea sucks on the Suggestions forum...you'll just have a useless name to go with it that doesn't really tell you anything about their age.<br />

And even if do have some one of a kind name, there's not a whole lot you can do with it. We know plenty of celebrity names and quite a few of the blizzard developers names, and nothings happening to them.<br />

Exactly.<br />
<br />
And funnily, almost everyone whining about this have probably at some point plastered their first and last name, mobile number, or other personal information elsewhere on the internet such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter etc. So why are they suddenly worried that their first and last names will be shown on a WoW forum where no one would care about looking for them, anyway? Because these are the people that post on those level 1 alts trolling other people due to lacking the balls to post on their main. The sensible ones who will have posts worth reading will recognize this as a beneficial change, while it chases the trolls and e-thugs away along with players that have a tendancy to knee-jerk react to changes, making the WoW forums a better place to visit.<br />
<br />

You have no idea how much about you is just floating out there waiting for someone to find it. Believe it or not, you don't have as much privacy online as you think.<br />
<br />
But the reality is that:<br />
-Most people who have or can gain access to your info don't want it or even care about it.<br />
-Online communication is so commonplace that it should be treated like face to face as far as basic information available and behavior. I mean, we talk to friends and family online, we have business meetings, conference calls, stay in touch with people, meet strangers, etc. We do this all online so much more, stop acting like this is something that wasn't bound to happen somewhere online.<br />
-This isn't the age of the dangerous internet like in the 90s, most people online really don't care who you are enough to help or hinder you, stop acting like the world is out to get you.<br />
-AS far as people talking about future employers not hiring you because of WoW......ROFL. Are you serious? I'm in college for business and I can tell you it won't prevent you from getting hired, unless you slack on your job because of it. We are living in a an age, where if possible boss in under 30, its becoming acceptable to text message them instead of calling, because that's the standard. What if the future boss is under 25, I was told by someone who goes over resumes and helps people find jobs to actually send a text or even send a message via Facebook. What we think about how people see things like hobbies and networking are vastly different than even 5 years ago.<br />
-As for any extreme case of stalking people try to list.....don't care, statistically irrelevant. We could also talk about how knowing a real name could prevent harassment or even help locate dangerous people faster (pedos and serial stalkers come to mind).<br />
<br />
Really, people need to start thinking before they act and think about the general rules and not the exceptions when deciding how good something is. This is a huge improvement that helps FAR FAR more than it hurts. But people will whine about how stupid on unsafe this change will be, but will open a door to a stranger or answer a phone call that they can't see on the caller id.<br />
<br />
I really don't see how this makes it any less safe, going to a bar or club seems more dangerous than this. AS for privacy, like I said, it really isn't as private as you think online, so that's a non issue and a moot point to tear anything down about real ID just yet.<br />
<br />
The burden isn't on the anonymous to prove that going PUBLIC with information like your full name is DANGEROUS.<br />
<br />
And it's irrelevant to prove the opposite, because the only harm that comes from anonymity is the ability to say what you really want to say. As much trolling as that permits, it also allows people to be MUCH more honest.</div></div><hr />

Sure, all the John Smith's out there may not care, but some of us do have some unique names. Trolls will be trolls. Now instead of using armory and &quot;lol ur arena scoring&quot; people, they can google someone and be like &quot;lol ur real life pic&quot; them. <br />

Online games are online games. Many people want to keep their real lives and internet lives separate. If they want to up the quality of forum posts and get rid of anonymous trolls, they should just use unique ID's for posts and have requirements for the toon you're posting on.</div></div><hr />

I don't post on the official forums either, but ask yourself how long before they do this to Armory as well. It's common knowledge that it's within a &quot;Social-networking&quot; site's nature to expand in this way.<br />
<br />
Correction: It's not freely on the internet and out of their control, it's completely optional to post on those forums and not a requirement at all in order to play the game. You have a choice to post your information out there or not by making a post or not. It's completely up to you.</div></div><hr />

THIS IS A TERRIBLE IDEA. A REAAAALLY TERRIBLE IDEA. The forum code is old and needs updating but THAT IS NOT THE WAY TO DO IT.<br />

And funnily, almost everyone whining about this have probably at some point plastered their first and last name, mobile number, or other personal information elsewhere on the internet such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter etc. So why are they suddenly worried that their first and last names will be shown on a WoW forum where no one would care about looking for them, anyway? Because these are the people that post on those level 1 alts trolling other people due to lacking the balls to post on their main. The sensible ones who will have posts worth reading will recognize this as a beneficial change, while it chases the trolls and e-thugs away along with players that have a tendancy to knee-jerk react to changes, making the WoW forums a better place to visit.<br />
<br />
Kudos, Blizzard.<br />
<br />
And you're the kind of person who gets trolled easily, or can't formulate any sort of an argument so you run and cry to Blizzard sayin &quot;MAKE THEM POST THEIR FULL NAME PLEAAAASE&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can make a straw man argument too, BRO.<br />
<br />
When on the blizzard forums I never post on a forum alt. I post on my main. I do not my full name being broadcast to the world. I have my information posted on Facebook, however I do not have anything to do with this game on my Facebook page.<br />
<br />
Take your e-thug and troll fantasies away and recognize this as a breach of PRIVACY and not just a way for you to get some semblance of internet justice through killing off trolls.<br />

I'm all about creating a great community etc but this is to much, to fast. I have 1 RL friend on RealID atm, someone I know in RL and completely trust. Couple a days ago my GM gave the officers his RealID and I didn't add him eventhough I've played with him for quite a while now. That's inside a guild then, where atleast you 'know' the people a bit. Now they want us to give up our real name to post on the forums? I barely post on the forums, just to report bugs, ask a question, or reply to a post on my realm's forum but they wont see me there anymore after the inplement this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the idea of online bullying reaching personal levels. Sure, the risk of these people showing up to your house is close to nil but that doesn't mean they can't harass you about your looks, education, hobbies, etc. Some people don't care, others do. <br />
<br />
Many websites that require you to enter personal information when you sign up (IE facebook) also sell that information to companies making it easy to find out stuff you don't want people to know. <br />

<br />
And it's irrelevant to prove the opposite, because the only harm that comes from anonymity is the ability to say what you really want to say. As much trolling as that permits, it also allows people to be MUCH more honest.<br />
<br />
Its no where near as dangerous as you'd like to believe, like I said, everyone's name is already out there adn if someone wanted to do real harm, there are better ways than using forums on the blizzard site.<br />
<br />
And there is harm from not knowing who people are, they act as they truly would and it does affect people. I'd rather have people behave because they are in fear of being know that have people keep acting like they do because of anonymity. To put it simply, if this were like Death Note, I'd agree with Light because I'm tired a participating in things where people who behave poorly get away with it.<br />
<br />
I know that my privacy online is a joke for the most part, I damn well better get some perks for it. People keep living under this assumption about how private we have things.....we really don't. People need to stop laboring under a delusion and at least get something out of it.</div></div><hr />

What are you guys afraid of? That someone's going to Google you and discover you play WoW? Or that you can't troll anymore on the forums?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Tyrianth/Aaron above: People can opt out of the forums, and they can also opt out of Real ID. Nobody is forcing anyone to give away anything. It's more of an attempt to take WoW to the next step of social online interaction. Basically, and in my opinion, if you're not willing to stand for what you say, you probably shouldn't say it to begin with, or be on the internet. Privacy on the internet is a joke and an illusion. The new data storage directives in the EU (which has existed in the US and other countries for a long time already) makes sure of it.<br />
<br />
At least this you can opt out of! The only way to opt out of Carnivore, Echelon, EU DSD, Chinese internet security etc. is to not be on the internet.</div></div><hr />

Then those who think it's not cool can spend 5 minutes researching everything about you based on your name and see what they come up with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, the bottomline here is that there is very little feedback that REALLY matters to Blizzard, and those people are going to continue giving it because they're either obsessed or simply enjoy wow as a hobby (or a little of both). The anonymous tard posts all over battle.net have rendered it one of the toilets of the internet, true.<br />
<br />
But holy shit guess what happens to someone who voices an unpopular opinion or disagrees with some /b/ who will make it a personal mission to crap on you? Especially if you have an uncommon name that's easily searchable on the web?<br />

<br />
<br />
A completely shitty idea. Real ID is fine, but allow us a single nickname. <br />
<br />
<br />
ps: most of the trolling would get squelched on battle.net if you just showed all characters associated to the level 1 troll. That would only allow people with multiple accounts the honor of throwing up on th e forums.</div></div><hr />

We'll see if it kills the community.

You can say &quot;Don't post in the forums&quot;, but that's equivalent to &quot;Your feedback is unwanted&quot; which is a very good reason for me to stop playing right there.

That's what I was saying...or trying to say. You'll be able to see their RealID name regardless, and possibly a character name if they wish it. But it may be possible that George Doogan labels a level one as his main (and until we hear the method for 'main character' choice, I'm inclined to believe this will be possible), and then you're in the exact same boat.<br />
<br />
The only difference will be that, if/when George Doogan changes his 'main' character to post in another forum, you'll be able to link the two characters together by the RealID.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I think my confusion comes from the fact that posting on a main (up until now, the method possessing the highest perceived amount of credibility on the WoW forums) never stopped me from trolling the forums openly and unabashedly. Maybe to some little children to whom main character/personal credibility is important in their lives this will stop the trolling, but true dedicated individuals really won't give a darn, if'n you ask meh.</div></div><hr />

What are you guys afraid of? That someone's going to Google you and discover you play WoW? Or that you can't troll anymore on the forums?<br />
And what makes you think people will STOP being jerks and trolls? <br />
<br />
You think it will be because someone will get assaulted or hurt due to a post someone took too offensively? Would you like that to happen?<br />
<br />
Anyone that is rejoicing in this change is just holding out some grudge against someone who made them angry over the internet. Everyone else (including myself) sees this as an unprecedented breach of privacy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It only allows those who are afraid of something to be more honest. Also, it's very easy for &quot;AgentBuckwald&quot; to say &quot;Man blizz, you really fucked up. Your programmers must've been asleep because raiding is loleasy&quot; As opposed to John Smith saying &quot;In my opinion raiding was fairly easy in LK, what are the steps you are taking to increase difficulty?&quot;<br />
<br />
In a modern society, where cursing and foul language is generally excepted on message boards and forums, it's going to be hard for some people to actually speak maturely and have a strongly back opinion. &quot;Pwnuhard&quot; can write an unintelligent post with little use of punctuation and use the whole &quot;This is a message board you fuckin newb, L2P! QQ!&quot; While Billy Jamison can't get away with something like (usually). It's taking away, as I said before, the internet super hero's anonymity and holding the real person accountable for their actions. Which I love. Most &quot;Kids&quot; these days don't have to take responsibility for anything and let their mommy and daddy worry about it.<br />
<br />
I'm not worried, even in the slightest, about my privacy on some video game message board.</div></div><hr />

Not only can I reasonably thin that number down to 2 based on other simple information like state or possibly zip code but there's a button right next to my name that says &quot;background check this person?&quot;, giving me access to relatives, BOTH my previous permanant addresses (including one from 15+ years ago), 3 short term apartment numbers, as well as a bunch of other shit (without even going into the paid services).<br />
<br />
Fuck you, Blizzard. My name just so happens to be Bobby Kotick from now on.<br />
<br />
i could do the same thing by typing in random names in that thing. does it mean i wil lgo out and rape/kill/hunt/flog/jovially hug them? hell no. does it mean that i can use their name to buy things off of porn sites liek a flesh light? again no, because i have no way of confirming or paying for that order (no matter how badly i want a flesh light).<br />
<br />
everyone's name is already on the internet whether you like it or not, or do people really think their privacy is actually private? birth certificates, socials, credit card numbers, etc etc are already stored on massive hard drives all over the country/world, blizz is just doing what CNN tries to do: keeping you honest.</div></div><hr />

It better not because at the time of said posts we did not agree to our RL names being posted. You can sue them if it does apply to old posts.</div></div><hr />

Everyone that said that: Head over to /b/ and post your full name (just your name, nothing else), then insult Anonymous, and dare them to come after you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll get the popcorn.<br />
<br />
or just head over to http://www.intelius.com/<br />
<br />
search for your name across all states(do not include middle initial)<br />
<br />
for me.. 1 result.. me, there might be 1-2 other ppl in the world with my name(english first name, german last name)<br />
<br />
Im prbly gonna go delete all my old official forum posts and never post again<br />
<br />
also alot of people that I know of let the city they live in be public, and unless you have an extremely common name there would only be 1-2 ppl with that name in said city.</div></div><hr />

Well, for instance right now someone could sign up your e-mail account for tons of free gay shit fetish cutting porn, and that would suck, right? So yeah, someone could essentially triangulate on who you are and harass you if your opinion differs. <br />

Anonymity protects unpopular opinions. all this will do is cut down on unpopular opinions from people with easily tracable names.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you not read the blue post? Your Real ID name is posted and that cannot be changed without significant effort contacting blizzard to do so. I'm sure there will be some sort of restrictions on the ratings system, such as not allowing you to rate someone more than once per post and not more than once every 15 minutes or something. We have yet to see that though, but any anonymity you had on the official forums is now gone.</div></div><hr />

But that doesn't matter. People just don't like this idea. It bothers them, probably irrational but still. Maybe this will be a step to outing all the nerds of the world who still feel that slight shame for playing video games. Personally, I like my anonymity whether it is real or not.</div></div><hr />

It is true that there are some cases people will have legitimate feedback to give, but will decline to do so because they don't want their name published. <br />
<br />
However I think there will be many more cases where trolls will be turned off from posting, and overall the post quality will go up and it will be easier to find the constructive feedback that people post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anonymity also protects idiocy and trolling and anything else that can be labeled as poor characteristics and is a big reason why trolls and flamers exist.

You're quite wrong about that. There will still be idiots and trolls on the wow forum, they will just be trolls who suck up to Blizzard. Meanwhile, anyone who criticizes Blizzard will have to fear the onslaught of thousands of irrational fanboys.</div></div><hr />

You're very short sighted about the far reaching implications of providing personal information on a message board. Hiding behind poor grammar and insults? Really?<br />
<br />
I'm not posting anything to this retarded system, where someone who disagrees with me can look up who I &quot;really am&quot; and harass me for not agreeing with them, because my name isn't as common as &quot;John Smith.&quot;<br />

Stop posting shit that's associated with your real name then. When there are actual repercussions for posting things five year olds would find childish, maybe the tone of conversations will rise above that of a goddamn cesspit.<br />
<br />
Worst comes to worst, you stop using the official forums. There are plenty of other places to discuss WoW.<br />

Why are you assuming people will magically find your contact details just via your name. My name is widely available with my nickname on plenty of places, and a google would give you a county - that doesn't mean someone could actually find out my contact details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead of using people's real names - I think Blizzard should allow the &quot;promote/demote&quot; post function to help filter out all of the flaming and trolling. With demotions by enough people, a bad post could get basically minimized to nothing so that people don't see it at all.<br />
<br />
I think that would be a good compromise.</div></div><hr />

Looks like I will be sticking to the MMO-Champion forums from now on. Normally I don't post on the official forums much, but this change is ridiculous. Sooner or later they will make a custom title that shows your real name on your character, that is if things keep progressing like they are.<br />
<br />
I won't be using the RealID feature, and nor will I use the WoW Forums ever again. :| I just hope this is where they stop, or even better I hope they reconsider making this change, but this IS Blizzard.. so I doubt they'll stop adding it.</div></div><hr />

Considering that you can still very easily leave feedback in game I don't see how this really effects people leaving feedback at all, I mean unless of course you can't login to the game for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />
