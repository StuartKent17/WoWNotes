<br />
I can see why they would put it on DR with psychic scream but all fear effects? Thats just terrible and totally kills my comp while leaving mage/rogue (as dual dps) untouched. <br />
<br />
FIX: Make blind share DRs with Psychic Scream ONLY and still share DRs with cyclone.<br />
<br />
The current way its changed is just terrible. ToL druid will totally OWN the way priest+rogue is owning atm and warlock + rogue comps will no longer work :/<br />

and you think lock + rogue isnt a little bit too overpowered? Its worse than mage\rogue.</div></div><hr />

I like that 300% healing on Deathcoil though. Brings it more in line with it's 2 minute cooldown. <br />
<br />
On mounts, idk, I can't let go of my faithful ol' frostwolf. He mah budday! They ought to add some other bonus to having a unique mount though (if they haven't already). Maybe a pumpkin mount that does AoE pumpkin damage with it's Pumpkin Pie Explosion. Just me daydreaming again, though.</div></div><hr />

The blues already said that they should have been quicker on nerfing certain classes/specs last season and that they will be faster this season.</div></div><hr />

Right now the SK gaming top 100 teams is totally dominated by Priest / Rogue in 2v2 and RMP in 3v3. These two specs are now more prevalant in their respective brackets than the DK/Holy Pala combos were. When you consider that DK and Holy paladin are both far more popular classes (almost twice as many palas / DKs compared to priests / rogues on most servers) then this represents a far more serious imbalance than the previous DK/Holy imbalance.</div></div><hr />

this was way to early to do this and GZ after giving 4 months of DK pallly glory AND mounts and titles they destroy a 2v2 setup that has been viable since season 1<br />

Instead of nerfing priests or warlock/rogue 2v2 teams they could just have toned-down the rogue talent 'Overkill' and that would have gone a long way to fixing the burst.</div></div><hr />

[Insert the famous 51/51/51 spec response]<br />
<br />
- Entangling Roots still has the habit of breaking very early off of its own damage.<br />
- Fearie Fire doesn't work vs -good- Rogues anymore, and it's only other purpose is vs Night Elves and Mages.<br />
- Cyclone.. we all know this one.<br />
- Feral Charge is not available to good healing specs anymore.<br />
- Bash either misses or is very lackluster when left untalented.<br />
<br />
Besides that, what makes the Priest such a good partner is PvP currently is that together with the lockdown in which they can assist better then us, (we only temporarily remove a target from play physically) they can assist in the burst damage of their partner via abilities such as Penance and others - Druids lack these and neither have the damage output of a Priest.<br />
<br />
Plus we lose the mana battle vs. any other healing class.</div></div><hr />

You're seriously bad if you think Resto druids can't be good in arena with those abilities. I played a resto druid in TBC, it's called 8/11/42, not 51/51/51. That's what he was referring to.<br />
<br />
This is a bad thing (removing blind DR with cyclone). It was there for a reason.</div></div><hr />

A little dissapointment, but if they are keeping the work on fixing raids or pvp to better function or balance out, I can live with my ramm's ass changing collor and accepting it as a brand new and different mount.<br />
<br />
(Now the ability to have different chopper collors would be something. Right now everyone is making choppers from the same &quot;make your own chopper&quot; box. Which kills the flavour. Seeing as choppers stand for something totally different, not just wheels to travel with.</div></div><hr />

I went back and reread every blue post about the new mounts and every single one mentions &quot;updated colors&quot; or &quot;skins&quot; to better match each faction's colors. Mind you, whether the colors actually match is up to opinion (The forsaken horse does quite literally wear its banner. It's not the blue deathcharger, there's stripes of purple involved too; and the hawkstrider looks more like the Sunreaver hawk that Horde aspirants ride into battle, which I really would love a mount version of). <br />
<br />
No one mentions any brand spanking new models. These are faction mounts. Did you really expect the run of the mill faction mounts to start getting bells and whistles? Spinnaz on your turbostrider? Please tell me where this talk of new models is. In any case, no one is forcing anyone to buy them. Heck, if you like the original Tournament skins, they're a lot easier to obtain now.<br />
<br />
Well, I'm not going to be a sheep and complain about how &quot;default&quot; these mounts look because I am in fact rejoicing about not having to farm Anzu or ZG for my (incorrectly colored orange) red dragonhawk mount. I just have to do a lot of dailies. And then the cash flow should be enough to buy that 16000 gold mammoth. 76 mounts down and the Argent Tournament to go. ;)</div></div><hr />

After all the hotfixes i noticed that mobs (not bosses) get lower dmg per tick from rupture than the Boss dummy in ogri. I it all right? with 3.7k ap i make more dmg to a boss dummy with rupture than to heroic mobs (not bosses) while having 5k ap =/ even in hVH with squishy mobs .WTF??!!<br />

Hmm... The ability to attach spinners to a mount of your choosing...<br />

I can see why they would put it on DR with psychic scream but all fear effects? Thats just terrible and totally kills my comp while leaving mage/rogue (as dual dps) untouched. <br />

FIX: Make blind share DRs with Psychic Scream ONLY and still share DRs with cyclone.<br />

The current way its changed is just terrible. ToL druid will totally OWN the way priest+rogue is owning atm and warlock + rogue comps will no longer work :/<br />

Power to the people! Resto druids are keeping you down! Amen brother! ;D<br />
Not too long ago, they actually DID represent the class. When you talked about druids and arenas, you automatically talked about resto druids, not about ferals and definitely not about moonkin druids. This has become a bit of a habbit i think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS: Still won't make the removal of Blind's DR with Cyclone a wise design choice, however.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello? Moonfire is as powerful as SWP is it not? and the same instant cast time? also.. doesnt mooonfire stack? I dont know too much about druids but I know they use several schools of magic (compared to a priests 2) so if interrupted; a priest will be useless for 7 seconds *minimum* whereas a druid has several HoTs. Why are Druids still QQ'ing? I remember they cried about the hunter scare beast and got their own way then.. I meet a lot of tree's and birds and they are one of the hardest classes to kill .. if they are outnumbered they can change to catform and run off... whilst their enemy is still in combat. Druids also get to root, cyclone and some others... OP class imo and I would love one.<br />
<br />
Maybe before WoTLK mana burn was OP (wouldnt know didnt use it that much) but now it is useless in PVP whether 10 or 13%.. even if I spec for it to be a 0.5 sec cast time.. how the heck am I going to cast it when I'm mainly dispelling the dozen or so spells already on me? If you leave a priest time to cast mana burn on you then it's YOUR BAD TACTICS/PLAY. <br />
<br />
A priest has a single CC (psycic scream).. which is now nerfed.. their Shield only absorbs 2.5k on average (and pain suppression is 8 seconds duration with only 40% dmg reduction) compared to a paladins 100% which is not dispellable and the MANY intterupts that we will suffer being a healing class. Maybe the priest should get a spell that when incap'd protects the priest for xx% naturally instead of having to use a glyph and pain suppression CD OR just give us spells that arent HOLY that we can use to defend ourselves with... I've played arena making ZERO casts (after my initial PWS) because of the stupidly long intterupts that blizz gives some classes.<br />
<br />
So what blizzard is saying is &quot;if a priest plays with a rogue, expect the priest to lose his only CC spell&quot; but Druids are ok ... thanks again blizz :(<br />
<br />
I am more concerned that the mana reduction talent for PWS is halved and that divine hymn is reduced by 30%.. is there any point in playing a disci priest anymore? surely paladin and druids are the MOST attractive healing classes now as well as being totally MULTI ROLE characters. <br />
<br />
To finish up my first post here I wanna share what I was discussing yesterday with some friends.. that *surely* the more pure classes such as Warrior, Priest, warlocks and hunters should be the most powerful at their specific DPS/Tank/Healing role.. rather than mixed classes such as druids and paladins who are multi skilled and can pwn in each role regardless of their spec.<br />
I would include mages but they are OP already, with many CC skills.</div></div><hr />
