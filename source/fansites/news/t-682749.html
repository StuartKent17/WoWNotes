Second wing of Icecrown Citadel will open in 28 Days<br />
Icecrown Citadel opened with 4 bosses available: Lord Marrowgar (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=897), Lady Deathwhisper (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=894), Gunship Battle (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=893), Deathbringer Saurfang (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=900).<br />
<br />
It will take a few weeks before players can reach the next 3 bosses: Rotface (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=899), Festergut (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=892), Professor Putricide (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=898). You can check how many days are left before the next unlock by talking to your faction NPC (Saurfang/Muradin) after defeating Deathbringer Saurfang. Thanks to Eisley from Eclipsed (US-Destromath) for the screenshot.<br />
<br />
The next unlock will happen on January 5th, if each wing is unlocked after a month it means that we won't see Arthas before April but if I had to give my opinion I would say that it will probably be faster than that. The 4 weeks are probably here to let people test the rest of the content without focusing too much on raid instances. <br />

The issues listed here are frequently reported issues that will be addressed at a later date.<br />
<br />
The latest patch notes can always be found at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/<br />
<br />
General Issues<br />
Logging out inside a battleground and logging back in after the BG is completed will cause characters to be unable to queue using the Looking for Dungeon System.<br />
Spamming the Auto Attack button causes the character to play the attack animation even though no actual attack is done.<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Escape from Durnhold - At the end of the Escape from Durnholde instance Erozion teleports you back to Caverns of Time rather than where you entered the instance from.<br />
Halls of Reflection - Player will get disconnected when running up the ramp to the ship. <br />
<br />
Quests<br />
Horde players do not receive a parachute when the Kor'kron Troop Transport is destroyed during the quest, &quot;Assault by Air&quot;. <br />
<br />

The dungeon finder visual UI will sometimes display inaccurate class archetype counts.<br />
The group “guide” is called “Party Leader” in chat. <br />

Buff Box<br />
I will take this moment to plug again one of my favorite new interface features, the buff box. It puts long-term and very short-term, spammy buffs into a stack of icons so that you can notice more important ones when they pop up.<br />
<br />
There is a similar new option for restricting only your debuffs on the target (in case you don't care about what the Shadow Priests are doing, but you really want to notice Sunder Armor, Thunderclap and Demo Shout.)<br />
<br />
It's not for everyone, but it might be useful to some of you.<br />
<br />
Interface - Buffs and Debuffs - Consolidate Buffs and Castable Debuffs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/21724982793-i-hate-the-new-interface-as-a-tank.html))<br />
<br />
Dungeon System Restrictions<br />
There are only two things that will prevent you from using Dungeon Finder to enter a dungeon: 1) You aren't attuned yet. The new Icecrown dungeons for example require you to do the first wing first. 2) Your gear is too low. To be clear, we are very lenient on this last point. It's basically there to keep new players in quest greens from stumbling into heroics where they'll probably struggle. (If you really want to take an undergeared player like this, you can still zone in the old-fashioned way). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21730603153-serious-dps-problem-with-lfg-system.html))<br />
<br />
Cross-Realms Dungeon crashes<br />
The issue here is a result of the stress the instance servers are under. Resolving this remains a top priority for us. If you are unable to properly zone into a dungeon, you can try clicking on the Dungeon Finder icon and selecting &quot;Teleport to Instance.&quot; This should temporarily prevent you from receiving the Dungeon Deserter debuff, or enacting the Dungeon Finder cooldown.<br />
<br />
That said, we will look into ways of improving the way dungeon cooldowns are applied in the event players are unable to properly zone into an instance. In the mean time I do apologize for what happened to you. Many players are currently experiencing similar issues zoning into instances tonight and we're confident we'll have a fix for that soon.

ilvl 251 T10 Tanking Chest<br />
There is a bug with the stats on the 10-player version of the tier 10 tanking DK breastplate.<br />
<br />
If you manage to acquire this item, we will get the stats straightened out. However I can't give you a timeline on when that will be. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/21730673021-no-first-tier-t10-dk-tank-chest.html))</div></div><hr />

That is the most RETARDED thing I have ever heard.<br />
<br />
You are vehement on making it easy to gear up people through throwing loot at them through badges in heroics, but you want them to hang around doings quests for blues for ages to get to that point?<br />

It makes sense, right after the holidays, New year etc.<br />

How would people feel if they decided to release the second wing during christmas holidays?<br />
People should be spending times with their families and/or friends during that time.<br />

My guess is that it won't take 28 days to open the 3rd+ wing.</div></div><hr />

Nerdrage much? <br />
<br />
When you hit 80, you are pretty much covered in iLvl 175-200 blue items. Becoming Heroic ready should be a matter of few hours...<br />

And where did you get the &quot;ages&quot; part from? You know nothing about the required iLvl, but decide to rant anyway?<br />

And yeah the 28 days is a pain, I'd like to have seen it all at once but that was never gunna happen :p. As someone else said in another thread, it makes sense as in two weeks it'd be a couple of days before christmas, and a week later it'd be New Years, so one week after much merryment and partying ain't so bad in my opinion :p</div></div><hr />

Blizz is just letting everyone get good and caught up before unleashing the truly tough bosses. It's also probably a good hint that we need to farm up some gear first as well. Besides the 5 attempt limits should be enough of a limiter without a long gating lockout.<br />

As someone has said already, the 28 days makes sense due to the winter holidays... and i doubt the gates will be longer than 2 weeks after this one.<br />

Apparently people are having problems with getting the Core hound Pup... it seems so far that you only get it if you are a new authenticator user while existing users have to ticket a GM.</div></div><hr />

Really? You expected the second wing to open two days before Christmas? It's pretty obvious that the gating is here to make sure people do not spend this time of the year with hardcore raiding and going for world firsts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My warlock alt is in about 50% iLevel 200 BoEs and the rest sub-200s, including a few greens. The only heroics the system will not queue him for are : ToC and the the three new ones.<br />
<br />
ToC he could probably hold his own in. The new ones? No way does he belong there with his current gear.<br />
<br />
They aren't saying &quot;farrm normals&quot;, they are saying &quot;the ones at the top end may be a little to tough for people with absolutely crappy gear&quot;. And remember, you can still take them in - you just can't use the new tool to get the groups for the ones it thinks are to much.</div></div><hr />

It actually goes through at least 4 different idle animations--off the top of my head, I can remember digging, begging (as shown here), rolling over, and tossing a bone in the air and catching it. It does these VERY frequently, on a much shorter idle timer than most pets. It's by far the best pet I've seen, and I have 109 pets (and I hate dogs, to boot, so that I love this cute little guy is a great sign they did something right designing him).<br />
<br />
By the way, the mobile authenticator has been available for more models than the iPhone for months now. If my 4 year old crappy little Sony Ericsson flip phone supports it, I'm sure there's a great chance yours does to.<br />
<br />
Even if you have to pay for one, $6 *including* shipping... That's a pittance for nearly complete peace of mind. There's honestly no reason NOT to use an authenticator. I'm surprised so many people still aren't.</div></div><hr />

I agree with the first part but I think it's just that they don't have the content DONE yet. They haven't tested fully the rest of the raid yet wanted to get something out quickly (for blizzard) to make it look like they were on top of things. Anyone who is honestly expecting Cataclysm before fall of 2010 is deluding themselves anyway.</div></div><hr />

Just before Cataclysm comes out i can see IceCrown all in one go without this shit gate system and kill the Lich King.<br />
Gear wont matter by that time since it will be gear reset in Cataclysm. And i will have saved $200? in subscription fees.<br />

<br />
When you hit 80, you are pretty much covered in iLvl 175-200 blue items. Becoming Heroic ready should be a matter of few hours...<br />
<br />
And where did you get the &quot;ages&quot; part from? You know nothing about the required iLvl, but decide to rant anyway?<br />
<br />
Idiot...<br />
/facepalm<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I had to edit my reply after looking this over some more. Sure, you can get a lot of gear from i175 to i200, but it takes a ton of gold to buy the mats or items in the AH. This is not possible for most players. Not everyone is good at making money, nor care to try to do so.<br />
<br />
I have a re-roll guild, so I went through an actually did research to see what kind of gear is available outside of heroics for them to work on. You can get full ilevel 175 to 200 without stepping foot into heroics, especially with Argent Tournament, Trail of the Champion and now Frozen Halls. However, it takes a ton of gold and a lot of time to get all that gear.<br />
<br />
Here is a list of gear by slot you can get outside of heroics for a melee dpser:<br />
<br />
Head:<br />
Spiked Titansteel Helm - Blacksmithing<br />
Helm of the Violent Fray - Trial of the Champion (normal)<br />

So your main annoyance here is you dont care for making gold nor trying too so you want blizz to hand you out epics and you not too make any effort at all? Wow couldnt be anymore 'epics for all' these days if it tried and your qq'ing its a crap system and to difficult? If its all too much effort and you dont care too make an effort, dare i ask why you play?</div></div><hr />

OR they could use the new LFD system as they are leveling 70-80 and get emblems anyhow and have a full t9 set waiting for them when they hit 80. Why people are complaining about easy as all get out to receive emblems and loot is completely beyond me, but then these are the people that expect that they should just get epics in the mail since they decided to take 5 seconds and log into the game. <br />
<br />
Its a VERY forgiving system. Pretty much, if you are a current level 80 player now, if you can't, even on a VERY casual schedule, manage to get a full t9 set in about a month or so...then you fail. Especially since 12 heroics will net you roughly 72 emblems (2 for using the LFD tool, average of 4 per Heroic)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole gear system to get in to the LFD is really nice if you ask me, I enjoy it so I don't get in to a group with someone that has terrible gear and pull them threw because they can't put up the DPS needed for the new heroics they put in.<br />
<br />
Also the new heroics are awesome, me and some guildies ripped threw it, with some issues because we didn't know what to do half the time but we squeezed threw with out any wipes ^^. All in all I would say this patch has made a good impact personally in the game. Only issue I see is the whole getting kicked out of the loading screen with a 15 minute wait time &gt;.&lt;!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Initial announcement said &quot;several weeks&quot; between unlocks. Dictionary definition of &quot;several&quot; is &quot;more than two but fewer than many&quot;. So three weeks minimum.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
To the whole discussion about how zomghard it is to get minimum ilvl gear--the ONLY heroics that you get locked out of are ToC5 and the three new instances. So other options for getting the required gear to run those heroics are the OTHER 12 heroics. So all that &quot;research&quot; you did to see what kind of gear was available &quot;outside of heroics&quot; was wasted time--you don't have to do it outside heroics, just outside those four heroics.<br />
<br />
And that's only if you want to use the tool. You can still form a group manually and manually zone into HToC5 or the 3 new instances.<br />
<br />
The 3 new instances on NON heroic drop ilvl 213-219 gear, too, which can quickly gear you up nicely. And you may not get locked out based on gear of the non heroic versions of those instances.</div></div><hr />

If Patch 4.0 hit the PTR tomorrow we'd be looking at a minimum of 6 months before it went live (the 3.3 period was 4 months and the changes were much less substantial), and usually the expansion patch is live two weeks to a month before the actual expansion hits the stores. We're looking late summer early fall for a release of Cataclysm, at best. That's only if they start testing soon, and they haven't yet. Personally I'll take anything before September as &quot;they made good time&quot; and anything before the holidays 2010 as &quot;about what I expected&quot;. We'll have plenty of time to get ICC on farm before Cat hits. No worries.</div></div><hr />

This is incorrect. Fresh 80s that don't buy gear or craft gear are locked out of all heroics. This guy for instance dinged 80 in ZD. I haven't done much with him. He still has Kara gear, old badge gear and a few new blues and greens and one purple from the Icecrown dailies...<br />

He cannot enter heroics. I don't think this is necessarily a bad idea. Sure I can probably do OK, but some time questing or running the normal instances will get him 187 blues and 2 triumph badges each day. It probably won't take many runs before he gets enough gear to hit heroics. <br />

Yeah... that's the only problem - you could do 'alright' in heroics - just as good as some of the people the system is throwing in there with straight blues and greens. It's just that your oldschool epics are bringing down the itemlevel of your gear by a LOT even though they're pretty good. That's the only problem with the system really.</div></div><hr />

I wish the system was a little more restrictive. I tried last night after raiding ICC to do the Heroic random. My 1st was Occulus........On the 1st boss I did about 6-7k and the rest of the group did 1k. It only got worse from there to the point where when going around killing the constructs I looked around and three of the other people said that they wanted to &quot;fly around and explore because I have never been here.&quot; That is about the time I dropped group.<br />
<br />
Now having been saved to that Heroic I tried again, this time ToC. This is where my new group couldn't even get down faction champions. The DPS was the same except the tank could not hold ANY threat on them and the healer was trying to DPS and the tank died 3 times before I again left the group.<br />
<br />
I guess I will just be getting 4 buddies together and then doing the daily instead of using the system as intended.</div></div><hr />

That sucks man, i had some pretty good luck in mine last night. I guess its the luck of the draw. But i was the healer ,and I had a friend tanking so that could be a bit in my favor there.... The dps that joined actually were pretty heavy hitters also!</div></div><hr />

Odd, I had exactly the opposite experience. I random PuGed three times and got grouped with people who had similar iLevel gear to mine. First time we raped UP in less then 10 minutes. Second time I didn't do random but fully PuGed the new ICC five mans and we pretty much cleaned up the first one. We lost a member to DC in the second one but still managed to down the first boss, and finally had to stop when we lost the tank to DC (this was during the time when the login servers broke after a few people made it in early). Later that night I randomed again and got a really decent group for DTK. Not quite as OMG awesome as the UP group, but we cleared it post haste (tank kinda sucked and couldn't hold aggro well, but the healer was good enough to make up for it and caught DPS that got aggro fast with shields). I wonder if you caught a bug in the matching system. <br />
<br />
On a side note, if you do the PuGs, you might wanna talk to people in group about looting early on. Since everything is cross server now some of the &quot;rules&quot; are different from server to server. My server always greeds on Frozen Orbs, but apparently not all of the servers in our battle group do, some need. The people who needed were nice when they realized what happened and offered to do a roll off, but it's something to watch out for.</div></div><hr />

Odd, I had exactly the opposite experience. I random PuGed three times and got grouped with people who had similar iLevel gear to mine. First time we raped UP in less then 10 minutes. Second time I didn't do random but fully PuGed the new ICC five mans and we pretty much cleaned up the first one. We lost a member to DC in the second one but still managed to down the first boss, and finally had to stop when we lost the tank to DC (this was during the time when the login servers broke after a few people made it in early).

Both of your stories give me hope. I may try it again when I get home from work.....here is to better luck this time. <br />

4 or 5 months to unlock the full instance is a little crazy. There's no way the rest of the gates are going to be that long. Gating for 28 days on this wing = stalling for christmas to pass (so we can enjoy our holidays). If they do it on later wings however, that's just flat out stalling for time. :/ Meanwhile we'll all be on our alts or playing COD because we're bored to tears with what we have available at the moment. It'd probably be bad for them.</div></div><hr />

I see what you are saying, but realize not everyone can blow threw content so quickly. I mean if you can blow threw the parts on hard and normal modes so fast then i see what you are saying! But realize that’s not the issue with everyone one on the server. My guild for instance will probably be able to do normal with few issues, but we will strive and get it done. But when it comes down to the hard modes it takes time. Of course not saying my guild sucks, but some people just don't excel as fast as others, or can do there job as well as others.<br />
So I personally think it’s great that they don't put it all out at once and get people to stay close to each other on progression.<br />

Stop saying crap like that. You can still have your friends carry you through instances just like they could two days ago. NOT having some kind of minimum gear level in a cross-server pug situation is a recipe for massive failure. I know you are actually kind of agreeing with that point, but seriously, the whole &quot;I can't do heroics&quot; line needs to die right now.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if some battlegroups weren't so terrible in regards with starting with full players, queues, etc, I would wholeheartedly be supporting a similar gear-check for people doing BGs. Zoning into WSG and seeing people on your side running around in the level 78 crafted gear while the other side is essentially two Glad-range 5s team is a complete waste of everyone's time.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard doesn't care if you are bored. As long as you don't cancel your account they are happy. Releasing 3-4 bosses a month in an instance will keep you paying for the game longer. Why should they care if you are online 1 or 40 hours a week?<br />
<br />
4 weeks is probarbly the time it'll take for each gate.</div></div><hr />

I want the authenticator on my mobile but the support for the Nokia N-series is appaling to say the least. They support other N-series phones which all run on Symbian OS so why it won't work on an n81 is beyond me -.-<br />
<br />
Ah well. Looks like I'll have to fork out a bit more money and buy the proper authenticator instead to get my lil pup :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Confirmed. I have one ordered and on the way, but tested it out using someone elses mobile authenticator.<br />
<br />
All characters on the account lost the pup as soon as I deactivated it - one character kept the pup in the pet window, but was unable to summon it.<br />
<br />
I'm just hoping that Blizzard will resend it to me when I get my authenticator in the post.</div></div><hr />

You expected the second wing to open two days before Christmas? It's pretty obvious that the gating is here to make sure people do not spend this time of the year with hardcore raiding and going for world firsts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not everyone is spending the whole second half of December partying with his family. For example, for Christmas we have a late dinner with both our family sides and that's about it. And that's one evening, on the 31st we usually go out to party with friends or depends on the situation stay at home and clash glasses at midnight and call some people, again that's about it. I hardly know any people who do this differently. <br />
<br />
And frankly, I would guess kids who are free from school at that time would rather play WoW when they have no strict bed-time limit as wait for when school starts again, I don't know my logic might be flawed. <br />
<br />
So no it's not pretty obviously, different people different habits.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andy_mitchelluk</div><div class="date">2009-12-11, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm. Anyone looked at the Blizzard on-line store at authenticators?<br />
I swear they were &amp;#163;4.80 before the &quot;Core Hound&quot; one was introduced.<br />
<br />
I can understand they need money but really, inflating the price of something that should be given as standard with the game is a bit too much.<br />
<br />
And it's not like this authenticator is any different from the old ones (which by the way, are no longer on the Blizzard store).<br />
<br />
*edit. Never mind. Just saw:<br />
Please note: Shipping fees have been waived on this product to reduce the cost to the consumer, and the new price for each Authenticator has been adjusted to cover the new lower shipping cost.</div></div><hr />
