Employee Alpha Testing for WoW Classic<br />
A few days ago we posted that the WoW Classic Beta was added to CDC (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8460-World-of-Warcraft-Classic-Beta-Added-to-CDN). It turns out that this was associated with the beginning stages of employee Alpha testing.<br />
Hey folks! I’ve got a small update here to help quell some of the rumors and let you know where we are at for WoW Classic. We recently began a phase of internal employee alpha testing. The new build data that many of you have been discussing over the last few days is simply part of this process. Phases like this allow us to test out the game content along with other functionality that will be used in the live game, like logging in through the Blizzard Battle.net App.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, we don’t have any announcements to make at this time. I know all of you are very excited about this game and we thank you for your patience as we continue to develop it. More information will be coming soon!</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I imagine that Alpha will go on for 2-4 weeks then either a Beta or whatnot. But either way super hyped to see Classic coming along great.</div></div><hr />

Literally doesn't matter anymore sadly.<br />
<br />
With PvP Power and Resillience gone PvP gear isn't even &quot;PvP gear&quot; anymore.<br />
<br />
Shame they removed it because people whined about having to actually earn separate gear for PvP.</div></div><hr />

We should be coming to the end of this raid, only reason we aren't is because of the 2 boss raid. It seems like a perfectly fine time to up emissary loot. You've had 3 months after all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess that’s a good point. Though the new raid doesn’t offer much gear wise outside of 1-2 specific things. I’m not quite sure how BoD as a raid is coming to an end when we have quite a while (most likely) until 8.2s raid. Assuming it comes out in July, BoD would’ve been out for 7 months which is why I’m questioning it.<br />

<br />
Nobody cared then because we didn’t have raid loot invalidated from world quests. Completely different time so I’m not sure why your comparing that. Gearing system has changed quite a ton from that era of gearing to Legion/BFA era. Blizzard said they’re planning on changing this though so im not too concerned with it. I’m not too sure how you can say nobody does when the vast majority of complaints have been about the new gearing system. <br />
<br />
Regardless it doesn’t affect me so really I have no place worrying about it, I just find it ridiculous that world quest emissaries are going to be offering ilvl 400 gear and heroic BOD (still the current raid, a 2 boss raid doesn’t take its place) also offers ilvl 400.</div></div><hr />

The next patch is probably going live somewhere in May. It only helps people with poorly geared alts or mains depending on how they spend their time in the game go through a world quest faster(or last expansion raids).<br />
<br />
&quot;Brain dead WQs giving same quality loot as Heroic raiding... This shit is why people are quitting your game, Blizz.&quot; That's not how the real world works, friend. Throwing rewards at players is how you keep them playing. BfA on other hand is a garbage expansion so far, that's what's causing player drops. It also doesn't help that the game is ancient by now. Seriously who would spend their time playing wow when you can grind away in apex, pubg, overwatch etc which is are entirely &quot;skill&quot; based games. Without people getting rewards for PLAYING the game they tend to just leave.</div></div><hr />

Agreed.<br />
<br />
Gear treadmill is so out of whack it's insane. Why should you get a Normal raid piece for completing 4 dailies?<br />
<br />
Hint. You shouldn't. The games throwing out loot like crazy now it's basically messed up the gear treadmill outside of Mythic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a damn shame how the current ideology of gear is either &quot;you get one, everyone gets one&quot; or &quot;nah we can't have PvP stats because people wearing PvE gear would get owned&quot;....<br />

There are still people struggling to clear heroic, not just as pugs but as guilds. This will be a way of helping them overcome that hurdle, and you try to get something with the right stats from the rng that is emissary quests. Not only that most of the time they don't even give gear, just AP or gold. This isn't the end all be all that people are making it out to be.</div></div><hr />

FF14's new expansion Shadowbringers comes out July 2nd. So + or - 1 week from that date is the window I see the patch coming out. Blizzard likes to say they dont try to have content drops coincide with other games but they have done it for so long its a given.</div></div><hr />

their current sustem is promoting long term casual play . this way people who sub for long can get constant upgrades. <br />

I haven't cleared mythic yet (7/9) and BoD just released a few months ago not 6. Raids require coordination and preparation. World quests are just chasing stars on a map and pressing your DPS cooldown and the mob should die by the time the DPS cooldown is over.</div></div><hr />

It's so easy to get loot this expasion with no effort. <br />
<br />
Mythic+ pretty much destroyed raiding for me, i mean the only thing worth rading &quot;item wise&quot; is mythic raiding. <br />
<br />
You clear Bod Hc &quot;once a week&quot; for ilvl 400 loot. while you can farm all day in mythic+ for 400 ilvl. My guild cleared Bod hc, it was fun to play with the guild but..<br />
<br />
After the raid i went to my Mythic+ group and farmed all week. We are decent players who farmed +13-15 keys, the game just threw loot at us. After 2-3 weeks we were as good geared as the top mythic raid guild on the server, becuse with the luck of Warforged/titanforge. <br />
<br />
It's alot easier to pick 5 good players and farm dungeons all day, than pick 20 really good players to clear mythic Bod for just 15 ilvl higher and aloot of wipes. and that 15 ilvl will we get from titanforge. We all have work, but played 2-4 hours each day and that was enough to get full top end gear fast.<br />
<br />
Hc bod should had at the release, dropped around 405-410 gear. Simple becuse you need more players and can only clear it once a week.<br />
<br />
Mythic Bod maybe 420-430? Mythic+ should really not be so close gearwise to mythic rading imo =/. Atm raiding is just dying off, and loot rewards this expansion is just way to high for doing simple daily/Emissery quest,warfronts and so on.</div></div><hr />

Raids require coordination and preparation. World quests are just chasing stars on a map and pressing your DPS cooldown and the mob should die by the time the DPS cooldown is over.<br />
<br />
and ? its still the same content week after week. so what if bosses take 5-7 minutes - for a lot of people it only means that the stuff you are doin is much more boring then killing rare in world that dies by the time cds are over. <br />
<br />
the principle is the same - both are hamster wheels - yours is just rewarding +30 itlv atm . but people who only do WQ dont care about those 30 itlvs :) they care about 385 they are getting atm .<br />

its very deliberate . and its working<br />

i see dozens of people on each quest site farming emmisaries. its perfect system for casuals.<br />

<br />
BoD came out in late January. An early July release is 5.5 months which is pretty normal for a raid tier (5-6 months).<br />
<br />
I didn’t say early july, I just said july. I’m going to assume it’ll be late July because they probably won’t want to release it near the 4th of July, similar to how they didn’t want to release BoD close to the new year. January, February, March, April, May, June, July is 7 months. I’m not sure where that confusion is. If BoD released on the 22nd of Jan and Eternal Palace releases similarly it’ll be 7 months of bod. If you aren’t counting Jan since it released late then it’d be 6 and a quarter. <br />
<br />
That’s not horrible, it’s a month longer than Nighthold I believe assuming that release date is accurate. I’m not saying it’s bad though, it’s just that they’re invalidating heroic bod gear with 400 world quest emissary rewards while the raid is barely halfway over. Raiding doesn’t exactly have any other rewards you can get seasonally aside from gear so that’s not something I like. They did say they’re looking to change this though so we’ll see.</div></div><hr />

Your justification for titanforging is that it keeps players excited for potential upgrades, and so they don't run out of gear to get, but this would never be a problem if you stopped handing out heroic ilvl loot and invalidating gear progression. There are tons of people out there with heroic ilvl who have never stepped into a heroic raid, and not to mention the fact that by the time my guilds heroic prog. is done, we are already at least half geared for Mythic. This seems to be having the opposite effect. <br />

Profits LOL, yeah b'cos they put more crap in the Shop, introduced WoW tokens plus hiked up the game services, they've let go tons of staff, practically all the original top Devs have left, on their own, and finally they obviously spend far less on the game take less time actually developing, refining and testing, craps just made up, not thought through and just pumped out usually broken or bugged, Any profits are NOT from subs to the game, Don't need no tin foil hat, thats facts</div></div><hr />

Fine! We do it the hard fucking way then! Emissary drops 310, world quests drop 290. Normal dungeons are 310. Heroic are 315, Mythic is 320. Mythic+ is where you go to get gear to just get into LFR! Which will drop 340 gear, yeah you gotta grind out fucking Mythic plus now just to get into LFR. Once you are best in slot in all of LFR you get to go to fucking normal.

I don't think WoW has 10 million subs but there's absolutely no way to know how many it actually has. Also, Classic is going to be popular for all of 2-3 months until servers become a ghost town as people realize how much of a grind it is as you say or go back to private servers that are FREE.</div></div><hr />

I mean that’s directly from Ions mouth. Taliesin said they (the devs from the summit he met with) wanna outright remove it but want to replace the positives of TF first.

I’d say that you have a point, but that’s a fiction so bad that even Blizzard couldn’t write it. Dailies in past expansions (IE: WotLK) yielded 150-250 rep for completing dailies while also allowing you to run Heroics while wearing that faction’s tabard to gain rep, and thus encouraging the player to play the content. Now it’s just gaining 1000 rep or less per day while waiting for WQ resets. Granted, I’m still playing, but feel that the logic behind such paltry rep gains is nonexistent.</div></div><hr />

from what i understand there may be a Heart of Azeroth level requirement just to get to the 385 rewards from the emissary. I was having some wierd issues when 8.1 came out where my mage was a couple ilvls higher than my shaman but had a lower heart level, and the mage couldn't get the 385 gear but the shaman could. With this new adjustment i would try to be within 10 ilvls of the new reward level, i couldn't tell ya with the neck though.</div></div><hr />

this is the most popular content in game atm .<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
You're confusing incentivized activity / content with popularity. Just because &quot;everyone&quot; may be doing something doesn't mean its popular it just means, usually in WoW, that it's the most efficient method in-game to achieve a particular objective.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been guilty of this same fallacious reasoning in justifying some of their decisions / content. As the setters of incentives they know better than most that rewards can effect which content is &quot;favoured&quot; or most &quot;popular&quot; and on occasion they have purposely devalued certain content to kill it off to meet their design parameters or justified the continuation of other heavily incentivized content based on this same specious reasoning.</div></div><hr />

WoW retail and Classic will become like 2007scape vs RS3. They are both MMO’s but have completely different philosophies and completely separate communities with almost no overlap. It will be better for Warcraft in the long run, because what we have now is this hybrid unfocused mess which is BFA.</div></div><hr />

Dailies in past expansions (IE: WotLK) yielded 150-250 rep for completing dailies while also allowing you to run Heroics while wearing that faction’s tabard to gain rep, and thus encouraging the player to play the content. Now it’s just gaining 1000 rep or less per day while waiting for WQ resets. Granted, I’m still playing, but feel that the logic behind such paltry rep gains is nonexistent.<br />
<br />
The logic is simple Tbh. The player base blitzes through content like it needs to be done there and then. Doesn't matter if there's hours on hours or not the wow player base has always been rush rush. Then once run out the cries of nothing to do comes about. <br />
<br />
Fact is that blizzard each patch could give Witcher 3 + all expansions worth of content each patch. Without something to slow the players down most of them would be done within a reset, then run to reddit or mmo Champ crying about nothing to do.<br />

And I prefer not having to go into raids or m+ to get upgrades due to having shift work makes it impossible to have a set team with me (you're not going to get 4 people to follow your time slots that can change drastically daily. Let alone 10+) and pugging is basically getting with people who would fail the test of tying your own shoe laces.<br />

The raid has only been out for 3 months why exactly is heroic BoD gear competing with gear you get for finishing 4 WQs? I’m done with mythic already but Jesus the gearing system is in such a weird place. Hopefully goes back to normal when they fix/remove TF and reduce gear sources like they said they plan on doing.<br />
<br />
Do I have some bad news for you then; they said they like titanforging because it &quot;always gives you something to hope for.&quot;<br />
<br />
That aside, yeah the gearing in this game is horrible. I'd much rather them go back to the old system where you have to, you know, actually do increasingly difficult content to progress your character. The reality is, a solo player that barely dips their toe into dungeons, let alone raids, doesn't need anywhere near the same ilvl as a high end raider. The time and effort those high end raiders put into learning their class, the encounters, and putting the groups together needs to go back to being rewarded and something the rest of us can hope to progress in to, not something that we wait 3 months and Blizzard just hands to us. If we haven't progressed past being a solo player who can only do the most basic of basics that are world quests, then that's on us, the player. It's our fault we either aren't learning or can't commit the time, not Blizzards.</div></div><hr />

We should be coming to the end of this raid, only reason we aren't is because of the 2 boss raid. It seems like a perfectly fine time to up emissary loot. You've had 3 months after all.<br />
<br />
No, thats not the reason. The reason is that raid tiers are designed for around 5 months, not 3. See any raid history ever beyond the very first tier in an expansion (which might be shorter).</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you're saying isn't relevant to what you quoted. &quot;Coming to an end&quot; doesn't = &quot;Should be over&quot;<br />
<br />
We're far enough into the tier now, that the tier is becoming irrelevant and it's fine to start putting in catchup mechanics for people preparing for the next raid. Now is a fine time to help people start gearing for the next tier, to help people gear alts for the next tier, to give players who don't raid/do dungeons some gear. <br />
<br />
If you still need 400ilvl gear on your main, you need this, stop complaining, if you're trying to prog heroic still and this bothers you, tough luck you took too long. Get better next tier. (Honestly you should see it as a potential nerf to the raid, increased gear, bosses people did 3months ago might suddenly be easy enough for you.)<br />
<br />
If you don't still need 400ilvl gear on your main, wtf is your problem with people who need it, getting it. It has been 3 months of this raid. We are now preparing for the next patch+tier.<br />
<br />
Raids always have this &quot;downtime&quot; after, when they're no longer relevant, they're pushovers and you're waiting for the next raid/content. This is the time a lot of people take breaks from the game. <br />
<br />
Think of it like a smaller version of a new expansion, that downtime that hits where you're just waiting for a new xpac, you wouldn't freak out if they boosted world quest ilvl to help you get higher for the next expansion. It'll be irrelevant gear by the time new relevant content comes out.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure I'm in the minority, but I wish there was no such thing as PvP gear. I think all stats should be normalized in PvP. Especially instanced PvP -- there should be a menu to select allocation and trinkets. And a level 1 character should be boosted to max. Just let us compete dammit! Give us other rewards ... tons of gold, pvp-only cosmetics (but really cool stuff), titles, mounts, etc.</div></div><hr />

Agreed with this, Arathi warfront still giving 370 for the end of week reward, just makes it not worth the pain. Even on brand new characters. World bosses are only worth doing despite the low ilvl, because it's so quick and easy, but you do 1 and by the end of that week you don't need any more world boss ilvl gear.<br />
<br />
I don't agree with increasing the ilvls of old raids though, not as long as TF exists. It will increase the pressure to go back and get bis items when you should be focusing on new content.</div></div><hr />

i doubt that many people who care about that sorta min/maxing will feel &quot;forced&quot; to do any kind of content with lfr quality rewards.<br />

Mythic raiders should, whether low end or high end. If there is an extremely strong trinket, that's keeping up ilvl 2-3 tiers into the raid, people are always going to go back to that.<br />
There's just no good reason to do that, new gear gets made, new trinkets, new set bonuses, you should feel like you can use them without being weaker, and feeling like you need to go back to old content to get a version that for some stupid reason is being boosted in ilvl.<br />
<br />
It's not like if it's lfr ilvl it'll need a huge tf to be competitive if it's strong. If there were dungeon strength trinkets in BoD lfr, you'd start having just a +socket on it make it competitive, or a +15. For what won't take very much time at all.<br />
<br />
&quot;If they got nothing better to do&quot; heroic bod would take 30minutes to clear a tier from now with all the extra gear. It would be very efficient time wise, and because of that, there would be pressure to do it.</div></div><hr />

So how will playing a Beta change that?<br />

If it's just exactly the same mechanics. Won't stop them from using their memory/guides. A Beta isn't suddenly going to change the validity of a guide.<br />
<br />
Also there was both a closed and open Beta for original Classic. If they feel they can't fix everything internally they will hand it out to public Beta testing.<br />

And with how much the Classic team seems to be caring about the project I think it's safe to say they will actually use Beta for Beta Testing rather than a PR stunt.</div></div><hr />

I get that angle, but I feel that it causes problems as well. Having to do the same WQs for longer periods of time is incredibly boring, and takes away from the parts of the game that I’m actually interested in. I know there’s the “if you don’t like it, then unsub” and the “you don’t have to if you don’t want to.” That’s the thing, I do have to because I have an interest in Allied races, mounts, and the achievements. I just think effectively doubling the time it takes to do things is an artificial way of increasing time played, and I doubt that I’m the only one who feels this way. It’s their logic, but it isn’t good logic.<br />
<br />
As for the ilvl increases, I don’t see the point. I figure one would do regular dungeons/WQs, and work their way up. Sure, getting a decent improvement outside of an instance is nice, but it’s unfulfilling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- remove titanforging. Each item now can be increased upto x ilevels via &quot;enchantment dust&quot;. Each level increase takes more &quot;dust xp&quot;.<br />
- dust has normal, rare, epic, legendary rank. Higher rank, more xp.<br />
- harder the content, better the dust. Quantity can be a bit rng. Lose a bg, 5 normal dust. Win a bg, 4 rare dust. Etc. No dust for arenas, raids - this is to promote a variety of content<br />
- it should obviously take a while to max the ilevels on an item<br />
- disenchanting an item returns an amount of dust related to the dust xp on the item to minimise temptation of stockpiling dust. Either that or give the dust an expiry date.<br />
- dust is boa<br />
- can rope in professions. Leatherworkers get 1.5x dust xp for leather items, jewelcrafters 1.5x dust xp for items with sockets. Miners can get small amounts of dust from mining. Inscription gets a base 1.25x increase over all items.<br />
- possible gain of a small &quot;additional secondary stat&quot; for maxing the dust xp / ilevel<br />
- then, remove better items from easy sources. Better equipment journey while still maintain the value of a variety of content.<br />
<br />
Where do u read this? that's exactly what they are doing to solve the Titan/Warforged problems in this xpac.

We've been gearing our friend up this week after he returned to the game, and after 15-20 M+ he's still running around with two old 390 pieces (3 rings). We don't raid so it'll take 4-6 weeks to get him a single set of 415 pieces (with random traits), good traits probably even longer. That's just too long.<br />

No it's really not. Because this method isn't working either and people aren't sticking around for it.<br />
<br />
You should not get a 385 piece of gear because you can draw a triangle or kill 10 boars. There has to be some semblance of effort in the reward and the current system does not reward that unless you do Mythic.<br />
<br />
And if you barely have time to play as you put it then you don't really need 385 gear. 350 is more than enough for both the story and LFR. And LFR drops 370. At most world quest rewards and emissary rewards should be 360-370.</div></div><hr />

Well I for one am enjoying the game, even with my lack of time. However I also would like to pug a normal or even a heroic raid every once in a while. However as I am sure you are aware, everyone demands absurd gear level for H. Most heroic pugs require 400 Ilvl when the raid its self gives 400 Ilvl. Thus you need some places to gear up. The emissary quests give good Ilvl but dont have the azerite traits you need to compete high end with 5 rings, so it serves its purpose. <br />
<br />
People just feel that having a ZOMG 425 char in wow gives them some sort of entitlement that others shouldn't get that because they did high end raiding. Well if the game is made only for high end raiders, it would be dead. I used to raid in BC when I was a teen with loads of time on my hands. Yet is still would like to enjoy the game. Blizz business model caters for everyone. Hardcore people can do hard raids while busy people have other options too. Just because a person can get max Ilvl cause he has time to raid, doesn't mean that others shouldn't just because they don't have time. Its a game after all, which everyone seems to forget and thus its done for FUN. When the game is turned off, all of us have to go back to our real lives and do actual stuff which does actual meaning.</div></div><hr />

Though the new raid doesn’t offer much gear wise outside of 1-2 specific things. I’m not quite sure how BoD as a raid is coming to an end when we have quite a while (most likely) until 8.2s raid. Assuming it comes out in July, BoD would’ve been out for 7 months which is why I’m questioning it.<br />
<br />
If you assume a raid set to come out in mid to late May is going to come out in July, that sounds like a &quot;you&quot; problem.<br />

MMorpg are about grinds? because its one of the main reasons i play one.<br />
<br />
That's why they should have left WQs alone. People should have to clear Uldir to gear up for BfD to gear up for 8.2. And have to clear normal, heroic, mythic dungeons to get into raids.<br />
<br />
That being said, on the mythic raid side, I'd like motivation to do WQs. Especially since I got my neck to 50 and azerite is worthless now.</div></div><hr />

Don't know what you've been smoking but 8.2 ain't coming out til mid to late june, which puts the next raid in late june early july which is right on schedule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When people do &quot;alt runs&quot; of whatever raid on normal, I go with on my main and carry them. Why? TFs. I got a 420 socketed trinket from Conclave on a normal run. That's good for the game.<br />
<br />
If that same item had some to some shitty 365 ilvl guy getting carried, that would have been bad for the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Titanforging is a good system because it encourages &quot;mythic raiders&quot; to still do heroic and normal. They just need to skew the TF chances based on ilvl, so someone with crappy ilvl getting carried never gets a high TF item. They should even skew it so the 415 carrying guy has a BETTER chance of getting a TF if there are lots of undergeared people in the group.<br />
<br />
Can you imagine? LFG groups demanding LOW ilvl people to indirectly funnel TF drops to carries?<br />

Agreed with this, Arathi warfront still giving 370 for the end of week reward, just makes it not worth the pain. Even on brand new characters. World bosses are only worth doing despite the low ilvl, because it's so quick and easy, but you do 1 and by the end of that week you don't need any more world boss ilvl gear.<br />
<br />
I don't agree with increasing the ilvls of old raids though, not as long as TF exists. It will increase the pressure to go back and get bis items when you should be focusing on new content.<br />
<br />
I agree but it is wrong to increase WQ/whatever faceroll content rewards without increasing raid rewards.<br />
<br />
My 385 + socket construct overcharger that I got the first week of mythic Uldir is better than many 410 trinkets for me already. I really should be farming that weekly for a chance at a better forge as is. If they upped the ilvl I'd definitely have to do it.<br />

I really hope there will not be a public beta for classic.<br />
Right now everybody has to work with what he remembers from 2006 and/or old videos/guides.<br />
<br />
I want that to stay this way.<br />
<br />
Pretending private servers don't exist?<br />
<br />
There has been over a decade of theory poured on top of the 2006 content. People who think they were good back then are going to get absolutely obliterated by people who have kept up with the theory improvements since then.</div></div><hr />

You think eternal palace is coming out in May? We just entered the PTR testing for a really large patch and it’s almost the end of April. Most PTRs take 2-3 months of testing, we’ve barely had a week. I’m not sure if trolling or just really ignorant but holy hell thats some stupid shit.</div></div><hr />

They used to like Titanforging, but now they're looking to either heavily modify it or, more likely, outright remove it in favor of something else.</div></div><hr />

They literally have no idea how to do a squish. Seen tanks with 300k hp plus which is half of MoP again.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile other games caps I have like 46k HP, 21K and 50k.</div></div><hr />

But I would also add that the transmog option also ruins the game. I remember that you could not transmog, that made a character TOTAL unique to that time and expansion. You can now transmog to look excactly(alsmost) alike the top players. For me, that douses my feeling with the game not having to strive agains that pair of shoulders, you can always get them next expansion. /meh<br />

Remove the transmog part for Vanilla - that would be indeed awesome!<br />

I like transmog, but I also see where you're coming from. Maybe have transmog for the current expansion only able to be used by the character that unlocked them? Then when new expansion comes out, it is unlocked for all the characters since it's considered old content.</div></div><hr />

Dailies in past expansions (IE: WotLK) yielded 150-250 rep for completing dailies while also allowing you to run Heroics while wearing that faction’s tabard to gain rep, and thus encouraging the player to play the content. Now it’s just gaining 1000 rep or less per day while waiting for WQ resets. Granted, I’m still playing, but feel that the logic behind such paltry rep gains is nonexistent.<br />
<br />
Who wants to do that though? Twiddle thumbs for 12 hours until WQs reset?!<br />
<br />
At least in WotLK you were able to farm your reps as much as your lockouts told you you could (indefinitely 3.3 RDF).<br />
Give players a way to farm reps.</div></div><hr />

Nobody, or at least I sure as hell don’t. I have to if I want to unlock Zandalari, so I’m just dealing with it.</div></div><hr />
