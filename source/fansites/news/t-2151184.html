Upcoming Class Tuning Hotfixes<br />
Hey all. As with each major patch that significantly changes class spells and abilities, we review tuning based on live data once it’s live, to look for any tuning issues that may have arisen. Based on that, we’re planning to make the following changes during the next weekly restarts in each region. We’ll continue to pay close attention to each spec’s performance as players progress through the Nighthold, and are ready to make further adjustments as necessary.<br />

Arena Rewards<br />
Just a quick update, we're still reviewing the accuracy of the data, but barring any unforeseen problems, we hope to re-distribute rewards at some point next week. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17614674921?page=6#111))<br />

Legendary Item Sources<br />
Just to confirm, this is intended and not a bug. Blingtron 6000's gift packages do have a chance of containing a legendary. He's a nice guy like that! (well, sometimes, at least.)<br />
<br />
Does fishing? it's quite a popular post on reddit, seems the SS is fake, but can you confirm?<br />
Can confirm that we believe the screenshot is indeed fake. After checking, there aren't any fishing pools that award Legendaries so if this player truly did get a Legendary, it's a bug.

Tooltips<br />
you guys can't just send out a small tool tip patch to fix it? Seems simple enough.<br />
We have that capability, but the effort required (mostly in terms of translation) makes it not worth it in most cases. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/815810322254610432))<br />
The process of translating the English text into 13(?) other languages still has very high overhead. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/815811063522304002))<br />
Translation is something that's most efficiently done in bulk (patches), not one-off little translations (hotfixes). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/815811834267594752))<br />

Well, he's right. Or you gonna tell me we do great in AoE and cleave? We do specialize in ST, even if it's not that strong as well. Enhanc damage should be way higher for how much we lack in aoe/cleave, but then again, there are other specs in need of some crazy buffs as well.<br />

Sure would be better if they weren't buffed but still dropped, right?

<br />
The point is that they still have no point. They dropped before and we didn't use them, we won't use them now either. We've asked the devs repeatedly about removing them from our loot list entirely but instead they buffed them ever so slightly. It's a pretence of fixing the problem, because it is a problem. If a small one in the end, although our best in slot trinket is also a dungeon drop, unfortunately. Lately I changed to using holy specc before opening a box, even at the risk of finding a life relic or a holy legendary. Unfortunate as that is, it's still better than an entirely pointless dps trinket. And I really do mean, entirely pointless.</div></div><hr />

Look at the performance of the various DPS specs since 7.1.5<br />
<br />
https://www.warcraftlogs.com/statistics/10/#<br />
<br />
Shadow was a good 10% higher than the second highest damage spec. They could cut a flat 15% off of Shadow and it would still be in the top 4 specs for DPS. These tweaks hit all the right classes. The top four, shadow, affliction, havoc and fire mage all got nerfed. The bottom four, enhancement and all the hunter specs all got buffed. These hotfixes hit specs that they needed to hit and buffed specs that needed to be buffed and even the degree of the buffs/nerfs seems appropriate.<br />
<br />
The tank changes seem a bit off, from what I can see guilds are putting warrior and DK tanks lower down on their list of preferred tanks in this patch with druid, paladin and monk being higher up. Method's Sco gave a good breakdown at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY7g-1OnwL8<br />
<br />
Blooddrinker was pretty strong though, in my, admittedly not fantastic ilvl 865 tank gear it was doing 1.2 million damage and healing for a single rune every 30 seconds. You can't do anything else while it is active as it's a channelled ability but it was pretty nice and I suspect even nerfed may still be worth using. The problem is that any burst healing ability has to compete with just mashing death strikes and with a 40% nerf it just heals less than spending the same time casting those so you have the strange situation where nerfing the damage probably means it will only be used for damage from now on. It did add a lot of damage though, it meant a rune you would use to do a 100k damage heart strike instead did a 1.2 million damage blooddrinker. Thats about a 40k dps increase vs single target. Fully raid buffed with better gear you are probably looking at an 80k dps increase. Even with the nerf it will still add about 50k dps to a well geared DK just from spamming it on cooldown and a tank ability that is worth spamming on cooldown just for the extra damage is probably a problem.</div></div><hr />

Completly unecessary. The hunter class as a whole is one of the best designed this expansion. Survival is a breath of fresh air from the boring MOP/WOD playstyle. Bm is thoroughly challenging and rewarding. If anything as i suggested earlier hunters need nerfs. Survivability and utility is simple to high and their dmg output scales to well. Wait till their exceptionally strong tier pieces come into play. I dare say they are one of tge most well designed clssses with only legion warlock being comparable.</div></div><hr />

Shadow Priest isn't a hybrid class its a damage class.<br />
<br />
Except that shadow priest isn't a class nor is discipline, they're both a spec for the priest class. The priest class is a hybrid since it can heal and dps. The only non-hybrid classes are mage, lock, rogue &amp; hunter.</div></div><hr />

you really think they would ever allow us to perform in any way as good as the &quot;real&quot; tank specs? They prefer leaving us with two meh talent and a 33% nerfed heartbreaker in row 1,blood DKs are not allowed to be competitive since 6.0(even if everyone still thinks we're OP because we top the healing meters,without taking account of the fact that we need that healing to survive)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what the patch notes should say and someone should pass it on to Blizz. Even these changes changes willl, if anything, only make Hunter's competitive in single target and aoe should they so choose to take that path, smooth out their rotation and reduce awkwardness when target switching. <br />
<br />
- Arcane Shot: No longer on the GCD<br />
- Multi Shot: No longer on the GCD and grants 2 focus, increasing by 2 for each target hit maximum of 10 targets<br />
- Arcane Shot and Multi Shot each have a 50% chance to apply hunter's mark<br />
- Windburst: DMG increased by 100%, cooldown reduced by 50%, now increases your movement speed by 30% and that of all allies within 5 yards for 5 seconds.<br />
- Vulnerable lasts 7 seconds increases only the damage of your aimed shot by 100% flat dmg, and now stacks. <br />
- Talents reworked, lvl 60 talents give you an option of 3 different castable shots applicable to different playstyles and situations, lvl 30 talents change the way the way that you apply hunter's mark and vulnerable to targets and effect your playstyle for aoe or single target play.<br />
- New Talent, lvl 60: Venomous Shots, your multi shot and aimed shot also affllict the target with Cobra's Venom, dealing 150% of their dmg as nature dmg over 10 seconds, successive casts reset this effect and do not stack<br />
- Sentinel is now a level 30 talent. Sentinel: 2 Charges, lasts 10 seconds, 40 second recharge time. When 3 or more targets are present casting Multi Shot has a 100% chance to apply hunter's mark to all target's hit.<br />
- Black Arrow: Damage increased by 250%, no longer spawns a minion to taunt the target<br />
- Careful Aim Reworked: Successfully casting aimed shot at least 2 times while effected by vulnerable refreshes vulnerable on all targets hit.<br />
- Patient Sniper: Old effect removed, new effect - casting aimed shot while a target is effected by vulnerable increases the dmg of aimed shot, marked shot and windburst by 25% stacking up to 4 times.<br />
- Trueshot: Old version removed, new effect: casting aimed shot 2 times in a row increases haste by 30% for 15 seconds<br />
- Lock and Load: Old talent removed, new version baseline (passive): your aimed shot, windburst and marked shot critical strikes have a 20% chance to proc Lock and Load, making your next 2 aimed shots instant, castable while moving and cost no focus.<br />
- Piercing Shot: Removed<br />
- Trick Shot: Reworked: Aimed Shot will now ricochet and hit all other vulnerable targets for 100% of normal dmg<br />
New Talent: LVL 100 Piercing Shots - The first aimed shot you cast on your main target applies a bleed, dealing 20% of it's dmg over 10 seconds. This effect stacks, and successive aimed shots marked shots and windburst increase the dmg of the bleed by 10%, up to 50% maximum dmg. If the bleed fallls off the target before it dies, a 15 seconds cooldown occurs before it can be reapplied.<br />
- Artifact Traits Reworked: Rapid Killing now increases your critical strike dmg by 100% when targets are at or below 20% health. Bullseye: Your damaging shots increase your critical strike chance by 6% for 4 seconds, stacking up to 5 times. Quick Shots: Increases the haste granted by trueshot by 5/10/15 seconds.<br />
<br />
What MM needs is consistent reliable, sustained damage, target switching should not be a dramatic loss in dps, some burst should be in there but it should be a reward for good play instead of an &quot;I Win&quot; button. To compensate our lack of on demand at a moment's notice burst, we need a stronger execute. I have bene finding that even classes such as WW Monks and Ret paladins are capable of far more dmg on bosses including Wrath of Azshara where our execute is available for the entire fight.<br />
<br />
Hunter's also need some kind of consistent dot, more opportunities for instant casts and to move as far away as possible from the current reliance on RNG as possible. We need our talent trees to be more streamlined and give options that can dramatically change the spec to focus more on aoe or single target as needed (or desired) from encounter to encounter, as it currently is spec options are limited to extremely clunky single target, single target with clunky aoe, and aoe but at a significant loss of single target damage. So where do the problems begin? Well the fact is that Trueshot can be incredibly ridiculous in AOE situations, but it is a completely awful burst cd for single target, it should be reworked into something along the lines of slice and dice because A) it would fit much more into the current interation of MM and B) hunter's simply don't do good damage without it. Focus generation even under trueshot is lackluster without sidewinders, so that ought to be fixed to compensate for the significantly lower dmg of arcane shot/multi shot. And hunter's mark is still far too much of an rng thing where you find yourself too often unable to apply vulnerable to targets at all. I think with the other changes taken into consideration this would balance the spec without changing too much, and make us competitive without potentially making us overpowered.<br />
<br />
The fact is that Trueshot in some scenarios IS incredibly OP in close quarter aoe situations, to the tune that you can literally just sit there spamming multi shot and marked shot for the duration for 3mil+ dps, the tier set bonuses and general single target viability are far too reliant on a CD that is just not particularly good for single target dmg, and there is far too much dps down time when either you have to move or switch targets and it needs to be fixed to even make MM a fun and rewarding spec, let alone one that does competitive dps or remotely lives up to the &quot;class fantasy'.<br />
<br />
Those changes I described here would also open the door for more exciting and diverse legendaries as opposed to the current batch of &quot;if you do not have these legendaries your dps will suck&quot;. Cuz newsflash: the only hunters staying at the top for MM right now have BIS single target legendaries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this has been the long standing problem since WOD. They invite people to beta and PTR realms get loads of feedback and never listen. As other poster wrote<br />
doing these changes just 4 days into a patch is laughable. Its clear they aren't taking any notice of feedback and maybe more worrying are any of them actually playing,<br />

Given that one specific list -- shadow priests need a nerf and everyone else can stay the same. Something like a 10% difference is reasonable and to be expected. As much as 30% difference overall? I'd easily call that not reasonable.<br />

You all need to learn what you are saying before calling out nerfs and shit. I see every one linking logs about Shadow Priest on Emerald Nightmare. Dude. It's the end of the raid, every good guild is doing every boss on less than 3 min, and, even from a dev point of view, whatever your spec is, you can't beat a SPriest on S2M on such a short fight. That's the principle. Though we will still do OK at NightHold due to the heavy adds fight, our mono was good and will now be mid-tier. The nerf on that wasn't needed, as usual. Logs are irrelevant until NH, and you only rage because you see logs without even understanding it.</div></div><hr />

I can choose to jump into a raid or dungeon healing or tanking or dpsing on my boomy(my main spec is boomy).<br />
I have 35 traits in boomy, 34 in resto and 30 in guardian. I can do all specs which makes me a hybrid class.<br />
<br />
You choosing not to play your other specs is not my problem, you have the choice to do so.<br />
<br />
Hunters (my alt) don't have that choice, they have 3 dps specs and thats all they can do.<br />
Thats why they NEED to be in the top 5,6,7 because that is all they bring, there is no utility nothing.<br />

Shadow was a good 10% higher than the second highest damage spec. They could cut a flat 15% off of Shadow and it would still be in the top 4 specs for DPS. These tweaks hit all the right classes. The top four, shadow, affliction, havoc and fire mage all got nerfed. The bottom four, enhancement and all the hunter specs all got buffed. These hotfixes hit specs that they needed to hit and buffed specs that needed to be buffed and even the degree of the buffs/nerfs seems appropriate.<br />
<br />
The tank changes seem a bit off, from what I can see guilds are putting warrior and DK tanks lower down on their list of preferred tanks in this patch with druid, paladin and monk being higher up. Method's Sco gave a good breakdown at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY7g-1OnwL8<br />
<br />
Blooddrinker was pretty strong though, in my, admittedly not fantastic ilvl 865 tank gear it was doing 1.2 million damage and healing for a single rune every 30 seconds. You can't do anything else while it is active as it's a channelled ability but it was pretty nice and I suspect even nerfed may still be worth using. The problem is that any burst healing ability has to compete with just mashing death strikes and with a 40% nerf it just heals less than spending the same time casting those so you have the strange situation where nerfing the damage probably means it will only be used for damage from now on. It did add a lot of damage though, it meant a rune you would use to do a 100k damage heart strike instead did a 1.2 million damage blooddrinker. Thats about a 40k dps increase vs single target. Fully raid buffed with better gear you are probably looking at an 80k dps increase. Even with the nerf it will still add about 50k dps to a well geared DK just from spamming it on cooldown and a tank ability that is worth spamming on cooldown just for the extra damage is probably a problem.<br />
<br />
You do realize that the supposed Fire &quot;nerf&quot; is just aoe, our ST is even higher than before the changes,just calms down our aoe, which is still a 16% buff from last week<br />

Once they get numbers from Nighthold, I'm sure things will change. Just wait two weeks. Also, some classes scale well and others don't, so with gear I'm sure it's going to make things shift around. They may of balanced numbers based off what heroic Nighthold would put classes.They stated that on Twitter thats why Normal/Heroic roll out first, then they will do more balancing before the real raids,Mythic, start.<br />

KJ burning wish ftw. Juat got this 2 days it was decent but 55 % ?Rofl.That is only good on AOE and that 55% only comes out to a 3k dps increase per target and it also takes up one of your legendary spots, not good, at least for mages</div></div><hr />

You may want to double check the trinket sims, because a 940 Legendary Trinket is BIS for all 3 mage specs. One quick edit to this. I am saying if you have it at 940 it's BIS as a trinket compared to all other trinkets only. It could vary in how it actually ends up in the list of all the legendaries a spec could have. Like Fire for example when compared to all the other legendaries 4th but Arcane has it as it's top 1 or 2 for all encounter types and Frost has it top 3 on ST but lower on priority add damage though it's close to others. These are also sims done without the 55% buff so this could impact the closeness of it on other types of fights.</div></div><hr />

Elemental and resto shaman both ate very strong choice</div></div><hr />

I am sorry I was unaware you could change specs middle of a fight, or even pop some off heals these days. Quite being stupid just for the sake of it. Each spec is a seperate class now. You just get to switch between 2-4 classes per character. Non of the specs are hybrid at all these days. Not a single one, aside from disc, sorta. <br />
<br />
You MUH HYBRID TAX people either didn't play in the early days, or haven't played since wrath or cata. Its been 3 expansions now that hybrid ability has existed in any really way, and 2 expansions since all cross spec ability has been rolled out of wow.</div></div><hr />

They are not functionally different classes, lol. They are functionally different specs. There is only 12 classes (Mage, Priest, Warlock, DK, Paladin, Druid, Hunter, Warrior, Rogue, Shaman, Monk, DH) and each of those classes have 2-4 specs. Discipline is a spec for the Priest, Shadow is a spec for the Priest and Holy is a spec for the Priest. Spec is short for specialization thus when you open the window to change from Shadow/Disc/Shadow it says &quot;Specialization&quot; at the top of the window and not class as you want to call them. Here's something for you from Blizzard themselves - https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/classes/priest. I wonder why it says Shadow/Disc/Holy are the specializations (specs) for the priest and not the 3 classes for the priest. Oh! That's because they're specs not classes.<br />
<br />
Depending on the games you've played you could refer to Shadow/Disc/Holy as the priests sub classes but, in the end even the developers of the game call them specializations (specs) so I wonder who is right, you or the developers.<br />

I just recently quit a month before Christmas, until then I had been playing since 1 month after the game came out. The pure damage classes haven't changed and the classes they've added to the original base class list have been nothing but hybrids. They're called hybrids because they can play more than 1 role in the trinity list (tank/damage/heal). If your class can do more than 1 of those roles it's a hybrid, point blank.</div></div><hr />

Even if your complaint is justified I think you're going to have a hard time convincing anyone to feel sorry for the most bullshit ganking class in the game. I'm not saying that rouges should be destroyed but I kinda feel like that's what I'm saying<br />
<br />
pvp is last thing why i am playing wow, they with this patch just removed my whole gear progress and balance from start of expansion thats why i am pissed</div></div><hr />
