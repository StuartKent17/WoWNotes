Beta Class Balance Analysis<br />
How much AP/SP do Feral Spirits, Fire Elementals and Earth Elementals get from the owner? What is the coefficient on a Shadowfiend's/Mindbender's attack?<br />
I’d rather not get into listing every specific coefficient, because it's a short slippery slope from there to us just publishing every number for every spell. These are unusual, so we can understand why they might be tough to figure out.<br />
<br />
Most pets have base DPS that is based on your class and level, and then get some % of your SP or AP as their AP, and get the standard AP/14 DPS increase to their weapon damage from that. The Earth Elemental is one of these traditional pets, getting 100% of your SP as AP (or 150% for the Primal Earth Elemental). However, the Fire Elemental and Shadowfiend/Mindbender are unusual. Their auto attacks deal magical damage, which means they also benefit from SP, as well as AP. I believe in the current build you have, they’re getting both AP and SP from you, which is complicating things further. We just simplified that, so in a future build, they will just get 50% SP from you. Try them out in a couple builds. <br />
<br />
Again, these are just to give you some examples and point you in the right direction. Teach a man to fish, etc.<br />
<br />
Currently they don't appear to scale with temporary percentage-wise haste buffs on the owner, such as Dark Soul: Misery. Is this intended, or will that change over the next few builds? Whatever the answer, is the same true for temporary crit buffs?<br />
Yes, these will be fixed in upcoming builds. We’re trying to get rid of all of the &quot;snapshotting&quot; of stats on summoning. Let us know if you think we missed any; it will take a couple builds for you to get all of the changes, but all temporary buffs should dynamically update to the pets.<br />
<br />
On a related note, we've been told before that pets should not benefit from any buffs on their own anymore, but in Cataclysm they still gained certain things like Bloodlust/Heroism. Will this still be true in MoP? If so, do you have a comprehensive list of which buffs can affect pets?<br />
Pets should not be able to double dip on any of these buffs. Any that still do apply to pets will be fixed. We fixed it recently for Bloodlust, for example.<br />
<br />
Because as an additional note, as I've been viewing streams, DPS charts, and watching some raid testing videos as well as analyzing there parses, hunters are severely undertuned right now. Some of them aren't even able to out DPS the tank (and yes, I'm aware of marking on WoL to show pets, and even then they are dealing minimal damage).<br />
If you have done this analysis, we would love if you shared it here.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight))<br />
The mathematical rune regen difference is minuscule, sure. That is not why Blood Tap is the default option: Death Rune costs are. So long as they exist, and such a huge part of our DPS depends on abilities that use them, we will naturally default towards talents/regen mechanics that provide them.<br />
I'm not following you. Are you saying the DPS difference is minuscule but you'll take Blood Tap anyway?<br />
<br />
I'll repeat: for our testing, you can pick any of the level 75 talents and do almost the same DPS. Now perhaps using Blood Tap makes the rotation easier since you know when you're getting a Death Rune, but I don't think that's what a lot of DKs are arguing. They are arguing, unless I am mistaken, that Blood Tap is mandatory because it's a DPS increase. I need to understand why there is such a disconnect.<br />
<br />
My newest source of confusion is Archimonde's Vengeance, the behavior of this spell when you don't use it's active ability at all is very inconsistent when tanking and I don't think it's worth testing it's active behavior until I understand it's current and intended mechanics. From what I can tell the ability is only &quot;reflecting&quot; boss special attacks and not &quot;white&quot; hits.<br />
This is a known issue and is fixed for a future build. It should reflect white attacks but doesn’t in your current build.<br />
<br />
Quick question regarding death knight Bloodworm guardians, they seem to completely ignore the new hit / exp pet rules. It seems like the receive no benefit from their master's hit / exp. They constantly sit at about a 15-16% total miss rate, which is pretty easily seen by looking at their damage breakdown. Is this intentional, or are Bloodworms simply bugged?<br />
Fixed for the next build; Bloodworms will get the same pet scaling as other pets, including Hit/Exp.<br />
<br />

I hope you like enhancement, GC, because I have 45 more parses for you to sift through<br />
I hope *you* like Enhancement, since it looks like you did over 8 hours of parses there! Thanks. Regarding your results, they line up pretty nicely with what we have, within expected error. Our recent buff to all ratings effectively also buffed Elemental Blast, which we’ve since adjusted for (from 3500 down to 3000).<br />
<br />
Will Echo be able to proc from Elemental's mastery? I would assume not, but the wording on the talent doesn't make it clear one way or the other. Also, does the effect have any type of internal cool down?<br />
Yes, Overloads can be Echoed. Echo only has a very short ICD to prevent it from triggering from multiple hits of the same spellcast.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock))<br />
Is there any word on what exactly the outcome for Dark Apotheosis is going to be? All we've heard is that it is not meant to be a viable tank spec and that it is supposed to be more in line with an dps warrior slapping on a shield and taking a few hits. However recent raid testing and logs have shown otherwise, right now DA warlocks are very viable tanks. <br />
We haven't changed our design intent. A recent change to mastery for warlocks made the glyph more powerful than intended.<br />
<br />
If you want to get together with friends and try out warlock tanks in dungeons, knock yourself out. We have no plans to support warlocks tanking raid bosses and we don't want to see warlocks in Dungeon or Raid Finder trying to talk the designated tank into letting the warlock tank. As I said before, a glyph is not the appropriate way to let a class choose a tanking role.<br />
<br />
I wanted to clarify that the current damage reduction is a bug, but please let's not derail this numbers-focused thread into a discussion of warlock tanking.<br />
<br />
What about dual-wielding pets like the Wrathguard and the Shivarra? Does the fact that their models display them as having weapons in both hands mean the game actually treats them as dual-wielders, meaning they will miss even if their master is spell hit capped?<br />
Wrathguards and Shivarra are indeed actually dual wielding, with the benefits and detriments associated with that, and are balanced with that in mind. I believe there are a few bugs with that in your current build, but will be fixed. They should miss 19% more on white attacks, and deal 50% weapon damage with their offhand attacks. They will be hitcapped for specials if you are.<br />
<br />
How does the Affliction passive Nightfall work? I ask because I've noticed some curious behavior with the procs (ignoring the fact that it's bugged and not currently granting a shard).<br />
<br />
The tooltip says it has a 10% chance per tick of Corruption to generate a Soul Shard, which would mean that on average you'd get a shard every 10 ticks. Nightfall seems to be doing almost exactly that, on average I saw a shard about every 10-11 ticks, and the majority of my shards were generated between 8 and 13 ticks and the spread created a rough bell curve between about 3 and 18 ticks.<br />
<br />
The thing is, if Nightfall were truly a flat 10% chance then that wouldn't happen. If you graphed out the number of ticks per proc at a 10% chance, you'd get a logarithmic curve with 10% of your procs happening at 1 tick, and slightly less than that every tick afterwards stretching on to infinity. You definitely wouldn't get a bell curve.<br />
<br />
However, a stacking 5% chance per Corruption tick would fit the bill exactly. On average you'd get a shard every 10.5 Corruption ticks, with a standard deviation of nearly 2.5. You'd have a guaranteed shard at tick 20, and a possibility for a shard at tick one, but both aren't going to happen very frequently.<br />
<br />
Additionally, as far as I can tell it appears that this effect uses all Corruption ticks from all sources, which has some interesting implications for mulit-target situations.<br />
<br />
If this is what's happening, then you've gone a long way towards allowing for consistent shard generation for single targets, without nerfing multi-target shard generation (and vice-versa), which was a problem with ICDs and PPMs on multi-target, and low proc chances for single-target.<br />
If you recall, early on in this thread, I talked about how we sometimes gloss over certain mechanics in tooltips, for the same of simplicity and understandability. This is one of those cases. A single shard is a really significant chunk of resource, so it can’t be a very high proc rate. But with a low proc rate, it’s very random, meaning that you regularly get fights where you get relatively few shards, and some where you get a ton of shards. We wanted it to still be somewhat random, so we went with a somewhat complex system under the hood that creates &quot;smoothed&quot; randomness, with a simple sounding cover on it (the tooltip). We didn’t expect players to really notice at all, so huge kudos to you; what you describe is almost exactly how it works. It’s actually a stacking 2% chance per Corruption tick, which averages out to an 11.7% proc chance. It does indeed count all Corruption ticks from all sources. I believe in your current build, it only is giving 1% on the first tick instead of 2%, but that’ll be fixed in the next build.<br />
<br />
We don't think every proc needs this kind of treatment. Nightfall is kind of a big deal, so excessive RNG could cause balance or rotational problems.<br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
The New LFR Roll System<br />
Normal raid (Live and Mists):<br />
<br />
1) Boss dies.<br />
2) The game determines what loot he drops.<br />
3) The group works out who gets what item, perhaps by random roll.<br />
<br />
Raid Finder on Live:<br />
<br />
1) Boss dies.<br />
2) The game determines what loot he drops.<br />
3) Players for whom the loot is appropriate get a chance to Need or Greed.<br />
<br />
Raid Finder in Mists:<br />
<br />
1) Boss dies.<br />
2) The game decides who is going to get loot. Each player has a small and independent chance to win loot.<br />
3) The game picks loot appropriate for those players.<br />
<br />
The key point is that traditional loot systems determine what loot drops first and then who gets it. In the new Raid Finder loot, the system determines who is going to win loot, and then picks something appropriate for them.<br />
<br />
The chance of you walking out of Raid Finder with loot will be about the same as it is today. Our goal isn't to distribute loot faster. However, you won't have the frustration of seeing an item that you want appear only to go to someone who doesn't want it, doesn't need it or doesn't care. Likewise, you won't have other players begging you to let them have the item that you won fair and square. In all likelihood the entire Raid Finder raid is composed of strangers who may never see each other again, so social pressure doesn't really work and we just plan on removing it with regards to loot.

Transmogrification and Legendary Items<br />
Just from this thread, you can see the range of arguments on this topic, and the various pros and cons that transmogrifying legendary items would present. <br />
<br />
Our current way of thinking is still that legendaries are and probably should remain to be rarely seen. When you do see one, you instantly recognise it for what it is, and acknowledge the prestige that goes along with owning one.<br />
<br />
But please carry on discussing the topic, we're really interested to see some good discussion either way. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/228711-transmoggable-legendaries/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4848905022?page=1#18))<br />

However, given that it was from the perspective of a tank who was in one place the whole time, I hope it's more exciting. The bosses look like fun and from the feedback on the forums, people are enjoying MoP raiding so far.</div></div><hr />

Maybe do something to avoid the trolling in multiplayer that would happen.</div></div><hr />

Too bad they seem to be the least popular, and the most popular is gear switch, which is a fine feature, but I would hate it if it were to be used for last hit on boss is when I put my MF set on. If you want more stuff from the boss, you should earn it by doing the entire boss fight with the MF gear on (which means only some MF gear, or MF gear with good other stats). Otherwise for optimal farming you get the set that beats the boss the fastest (while allowing you to live) and another set for highest MF. The best farming rewards should be given to the players who can kill bosses while loaded down with MF stats.<br />
<br />
My personal like would be:<br />
From the time the NPC goes from full health to 0, your lowest MF for that duration is used. For treasure chests and treasure goblins, it's based on the lowest MF stat you had while you were in that zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
imo the best solution would be, to cause every item or ability switch to decrease the duration of the buff by 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
this way you have the option to change exactly one thing which you think might be mandatory for the next fight or whatever, but nothing more if you dont want to lose the buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
additionally, this wouldn't make mf% gear useless. there might still be people who prefer to stack abnormous amounts of it and ignore the nephalem buff, which is fine then.</div></div><hr />

May as well have magic find just be your maximum available amount. It just adds an annoying, tedious button to throw in before getting a kill. <br />
<br />
Instead, have magic find be &quot;disenchantable&quot; using the blacksmith off of items, swapping magic find for another stat. Effectively, magic find would no longer work on gear. Afterward, I have two different ways that Blizzard could decide between. First, imbue the magic find into items that go in your bag. You can store up to 200 magic find in your bag which takes up half your bag. Just like with current magic find, you have to use bag space. Second idea is to have magic find get &quot;disenchanted&quot; into special potions. These potions, like neph valor, can be used to stack your magic find up to 200% for the next 2 hours, like a flask in WoW.</div></div><hr />

But you're constantly going on about all these super cool daily hubs that we'll get to do, that more likely than not will be repetitive beyond belief after the first week. ._.</div></div><hr />
