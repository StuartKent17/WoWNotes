Updated Druid Forms - Night Elf Cat<br />
Now for the final installment of our preview of the new art for druid cat and bear forms, we’re taking a look at the new textures for night elf druid cat form. Here’s a comparative peek at the current look of cat form along with the five new textures, which can be selected by switching hair color in the barber shop.<br />
<br />
<br />
Night Elf Cat Form *NEW*<br />

<br />
Then again the Nelf model was never really that bad. All in all looks pretty decent.<br />
<br />
PS: Might just be the crappy university PC screen, but the difference in colour schemes for some skins looks very marginal.</div></div><hr />

Second on the post, first on stupidity.<br />
<br />
To be honest. The model is awesome, nothing I wouldn't expect. But it says Female all over the place. My Druid is a female Char, but for the ones that aren't... it seems a bit ghay.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lilbandit</div><div class="date">2009-06-04, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bit disappointed in the nelf model really. They tried to make it look more scary I think, but that was never really the problem with the form. I think the new ones just don't really fit what the nelf cat is about. However I'll reserve judgement till I see my kitty with these in game. <br />
<br />
Liking the bears though, especially looking forward to having the white fur so I can walk around with my blizzard bear cub :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would have liked a more feminine quality for my Tauren cat, and the Night Elves got just that. I don't know if I'd be sadder to be Male Night Elf or a Female Tauren at this point. Ha.<br />
<br />
All around, it's a jump in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Cats don't normally run around with their claws out, as the old form showed. This one has the claws retracted inside the paw more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The one in the wow intro video always looked more like the new black(ish) one more than the current purple(ish) one.<br />
So I'm pretty happy about this change :).<br />
<br />
Nelf Cat is a ton better than Nelf bear. The new ones, that is.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocca8cc527ec</div><div class="date">2009-06-04, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They looks just awesome. In my opinion even better than the Tauren ones (certainly more original, at least they don't look like coming out from The Lion King...).<br />
<br />
And to those who think they look &quot;ghay&quot; just because of the nice necklace... Don't worry: your necessity to constantly reassure yourself and the others about your gender identity is connected to your puberty. It generally goes away when you are adult and you have no need to constatly be reassured about it anymore.</div></div><hr />

The Tauren Bear forms looked incredible, but when the NE ones got released, all I had to say was &quot;meh.&quot; They really didn't look all that different than the original to me.<br />
<br />
Then, the Tauren cat form got released and I got excited again. They once again looked really well done and were a vast improvement over the original. I was anxiously awaiting the NE cat form ones, only to be disappointed again.<br />
<br />
What is up with all the pink? Could we, I don't know, get one for a male toon? One that doesn't have copious amounts of pink or purple, and isn't wearing pink jewelery?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guramadon</div><div class="date">2009-06-04, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now all the druid cats look like they have the same amount of time put into them. Though I like the tauren model and will no doubt lvl a tauren feral druid, these are just awsome. I don't get why people freaked out about the lions looking like disneys lion king models, I don't remember the lion kings chars having nose rings, horns, side tattoos<br />
and braclets. And i personally think the colors are awsome anyways.</div></div><hr />

Night elves = agility, grace, fluid movement = well done in the cat model<br />
Tauren = primal, fury, strength = well done in the cat model<br />
<br />
Especially having the choice from a couple color models strikes my mind as positive thinking by Blizzard.<br />

what do you expect for the color scheme?<br />
really.<br />
I think these are awesome and very fitting.<br />
<br />
The Tauren cats are rustic and natural looking. They have a very plainsy/savannah feeling to them.<br />
And the Night Elves ones are more woodsy/ethereal like, they're great really.</div></div><hr />

This. Couldn't have said it better myself.<br />

EDIT: Lol on the colors, pretty much only one good maybe two<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, but no one is going to agree one which one or two those are. You'll have people lined up behind each and every one of them. Some people will want the black one. Some people will fall over themselves getting to the white with pink mane...<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh BTW: In case you didn't notice the Tauren and Night Elf models are exactly the same except for the ears, horns and nose ring. Any other difference is purely in the coloration. It was kind of funny to see early posters saying the Tauren models were better... perception is everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. they do not (all) look &quot;gay&quot;<br />
<br />
2. Tauren cats look badass, whereas Nelf cats look more diverse, with obvious options for both male and female characters (if gender-specificity is important to you)<br />
<br />
3. people excited about the lion king-esque qualities of the tauren cat forms are closet furrys<br />
<br />
<br />

Horns don't quite disturb your running. Having claws out does, it also damages them. Try running with iceskates, it is pretty much the same thing.</div></div><hr />

IMO the reason most people seem more impressed by the Tauren update is because the Tauren had such a terrible starting model to begin with. Almost anything would have been an improvement, and Blizz definitely delivered. The NE model was pretty good to begin with, so all they really needed to do up the polygon count, add some details and new colors. It's not as drastic as a change, because NE's didn't need the drastic change that Tauren did.<br />
<br />
To all the males complaining about the NE color schemes, take a look at your character when in elf form. Notice that you're not as &quot;manly&quot; looking as a Tauren? Notice that your skin color is a shade of purple/pink? And notice that you have strange hair colors? Now look at the models again, the color schemes fit when you blend them with your Elf form. Blizz did a great job of making the new forms represent the original race. Although I still wish they would have lost the sideburns on the NE bear forms, I think all the new forms are really well done.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I remember that, lol! I have a female dwarf and the way her boobs move when she runs is RIDICULOUS. Why do female characters' boobs move in plate chestpieces? The dwarf one's the most retarded; it's like my breasts are having seizures. Hint: Boobs abide by the laws of gravity too. They aren't bouncyhouses, and I feel ridiculous having a female character because of the way they move. Night elf bouncing up and down idle animation? Jesus.<br />
<br />
My main complaint throughout WoW has been that ALL of the females look beautiful and feminine compared to the male versions. Night elf males are supposed to be slender and handsome, not hulky and hideous...there is NO male in WoW that's good looking besides blood elves, and they're considered gay because of how they look, but us girls are supposed to be delicate, even as warriors? Bullshit. WoW has a growing female population of players, and it's not appreciated that the races that're SUPPOSED to be ugly (trolls, orcs, forsaken) look beautiful, but the men can stay ugly.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to take this moment to point out that the cheetah is the fastest animal on land... and they use their claws while running for traction and doesn't interfere with their hunt in any way. Entirely plausible for druid form to run with claws out.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;snarling nose&quot; effect is rather pronounced on both models, you have a point there. Anyway, I still like it. Maybe now I'll level my druid.<br />
<br />
PS: I'm now pretty certain that these are identical models between NE and Tauren. The only change is regions that have been doctored with transparency (e.g. to turn &quot;horns&quot; into &quot;ears&quot; or to make the mane on the NE model slightly sparser).

Both the purple/pink and the glowing neck ornament are highly in keeping with the NE aesthetic. Anyone who decided to play the race whose architecture is dominated by glowing balls and green/brown/purple and is now bothered by the same being true for their attack model really needs to re-evaluate why they chose to place a NE and consider leveling a Tauren (whose architecture is dominated by brown/yellow). There is nothing shocking in any of this. If you're just now coming to the conclusion that NEs look a little on the fabulous side, you really have not been paying attention for the last 5 years.</div></div><hr />

A Blue post a few days back seemed to indicate that they wanted to continue pushing out model updates, however, because Cat and Bear forms were the oldest and most in need of an update, these were done first.

Aside from the pink and white form all the other skins are in the same basic color family as the old skin. One is darker, one is lighter and one has simply slightly more purple.<br />

<br />
What I don't like is coloring. First of all, 3 models with almost identical colors. Almost black, almost black, and, let me guess, almost black. Maybe the artists who made those need a little visit to tauren forms modeling group?<br />
<br />
Second is that horrible pink color. Pink jewelry on black cat? Pink mane? A little bit more of violet or red PLEASE. There's nothing else pink colored in WoW except for a couple of shirts. The color is simply NOT epic. Not at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well there's more purple than pink in the night elf forms and guess what the WoW colour for epic is?<br />
<br />
Anyway the white one looks quite interesting, I like his haircut. If you're so worried about people thinking you're gay because of the colour of a game character, you should tell your parents your closet secret soon.</div></div><hr />

All Night Elves, males and Female. Have Different shades of pink in their skin!

Like many others have said, the pinkish/purplish color scheme fits nightelves, even the males. The necklaces are a little lame, but if you look, they have moons on them, which is the nightelf's symbol, so they make sense. I play a moonkin/tree, but I am glad there was a change. The old models were very outdated.<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm gonna love the looks on the faces of the people when they are killed by pink &quot;Hello Kitty&quot; cats.<br />
P.P.S The tauren models look great, too, and nothing like Lion King. They look way more Native American than African Savannah-ish<br />
P.P.P.S. Even though I play a moonkin and tree, i'll be going with the kity form to the far left, and bear form in the top left corner. I hope they update moonkin, tree, travel, and aquatic forms, too.. They don't look bad (except aquatic... Satan possessed manatee?) just outdated.</div></div><hr />

I personally am very excited for the new forms. If you're not happy with your skin, then just change your freaking hair color. There are skins that have no pink on them at all and when you are actually playing...you aren't in a position to even notice the necklace anyway. Grow up...seriously</div></div><hr />

Yes...that is exactly what I'm saying. You're not a keyboard turner...so you stare at your toon the entire time you're playing? You don't...like look for environmental hazards or what the boss is doing? From your quote...you said you didn't want to look at a fluffy pink druid when you play...if you're beef is with 3 TINY pink medallions hanging from your neck distracting you while you are fighting the boss or playing arena/bg...whatever you do...then perhaps a reroll is best.

The quality of the model isn't even an issue with me. I'm not playing for everything to look pretty. In real life I even have a couple pink shirts for special occasions, but it's not something I sport on a daily basis. I will give you that the top right one is the most exceptional looking one, to me, but that still doesn't make me happy with the change. :P</div></div><hr />

Sadly, I have what's called peripheral vision. I can still see my character while looking at something else. I don't want to reroll, I just don't want to look like a glorified cutesy kitty plush toy. Perhaps the use of the color pink in my statement threw off what I was eluding to, but it's the pink and purple hues. It's either the face, the whole body, or the accessories.

Fair enough. I apologize for jumping down your throat. I concede that your arguments are far more mature than many of the &quot;LAWL THE NEW SKINS LOOK GAY AND HAVE BALLS HANGING FROM THEIR NECKS!!!&quot;<br />

Other than the many clones of our normal classes without polymorph-like abilities, thanks to non-customizable armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, the NE form seems tiger-like in design and of course the tauren model continues to follow the lion-like design of the old model. Each then incorporates elements from their races human forms. Always amazed that the people that complain the most probably have the least amount of artistic skill. If you think you can do better, by all means... let's see it.<br />
<br />
And as far as tauren cats looking like Scar from the Lion King... if I were to make a Disney reference, I'd say they have more in common with...<br />

Im pretty sure that Night elfs are pretty much pink anyway...<br />
<br />
I thought both bears didnt get much change but both are definitly enhanced and i also feel that Tauren Cat got the change they needed for oh so long( even if they just closed the goddamn mouth i would have been happy) and N. Elf Cat looks pretty cool. Imo, it really doesnt look all that feminine except for the use of pink which is what Nelf's are primarily colored anyway. <br />
<br />
I think they all look good and whenever Blizzard gets around to changing the other forms, I'm sure i'll like those too.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. i appreciate the new modeling/texture/skins but its ridiculous how they specifically made the Tauren to be male, and the Night Elf to be female. I dont see why they could not have made half masculine looking and half feminine for both races. It doesnt seem right having the races be depicted as this. i play for fun and i do not get much satisfaction being the pink panther.<br />
i envy you, taurens. <br />

That's my speculation as to why all Tauren cat-forms have manes, because the original techniques passed through the generations were based on male lions. As for the Night Elf facial markings, the druids (who were all male at the time) probably thought it would be appropriate to gain the same facial markings as the warriors (all female) of their race.</div></div><hr />

Actually, just for the record, purple is associated with regality, mystery, wisdom, some cases wickedness, cruelty, death, shadows, plague, etc. Not femininity. Now, is light purple, which is typically called lavender, feminine? Yes, but none of the NE druid forms are lavender, they are shades of pink/mauve. <br />

That's only accurate if you want to talk about purple back ~500 years ago. I'm talking about in the current year of 2009.</div></div><hr />

Really, now? You may have me on the regality, wisdom, whatever in current times, but purple is still used today to represent wickedness, cruelty, death, etc, today. Let's take a few examples from the game you, yourself, play: warlocks; warlock's are supposed to be a &quot;necessary evil&quot;. They're class icon is a purple hand, they cast purple shadow bolts and have at least two tier sets that include purple. Shadow priests; shadow priests ARE purple.. shadowform? let's not forget mind flay, mind sear, mind blast, etc. Death Knights; Anti-Magic bubble thing, death grip, several icons, death runes, etc. Rogues; cloak of shadows, several tier sets..<br />
<br />

I'll give you that. I definitely wasn't trying to read too deep into the psychological attributes to colors. Though, I definitely wanted to just state my opinion of it since that's all I can really back up. I just want to keep this from that kind of generalization. <br />
<br />
I could go into how I like the color orange and that the color orange is usually liked by people with such and such a personality type, but I know that it's all a bunch of bologna. I just don't feel there's enough of a variation in the color schemes in the new cat forms to point out even one that looks remotely masculine. /shrug<br />

Well, let's just remember that this still isn't released, there's still more than enough time for Blizzard to come up with a couple more more &quot;masculine&quot; NE cat forms. And even if they don't, the blueish cat in the right corner has no pink, purple, or mauve in it. And besides, once they are released, people will warm up to them and all will be well. In Pre-BC, everyone was pissy about how &quot;gay&quot; male BEs were, and now BEs (even if not male in game...) are still the most populated race.</div></div><hr />

For the tauren one... a tauren is a hairy cow that change shape so they still need to look like a tauren they have also normal eyes and so on..... (BTW tauren forms look GREAT) (JEALOES :'( )<br />
And for the Nelf one... they change into a spirit beast because of the training from a beast god that teaches you to shape shift you can also see they have different eyes! (LOOKS ALSO GREAT) ;D<br />
So blizzard made them just like they intend to!!!<br />
<br />
So it’s not a male female story but a change in bone structure and a shape shift!!! ;D ;)</div></div><hr />

I am very disappointed as well with people associating purple and pink as gay. Seriously, guys... Your parents forced gender roles on you too strongly. <br />

The whole night elves and their starting zone is gleaming with pink, then why did you choose a nelf druid to play with?<br />
<br />
<br />
Having a violet mount is a very different thing compared to playing with a purple character. And do you have any other race to choose from if you want to be a druid on the Alliance side? (I personally like nelves and even their starting zones but honestly, there's too much pink going on with the race.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But... back to why I originally decided to write here...<br />
<br />
I'm a girl and I still can't say anything good about using only different shades of pink with the nelf cat-forms. (Referring to you men, who are saying they are too girlie etc.) I actually like the forms otherwise (They're not feminine IMO, only comparing to very masculine tauren form they may be... If you compared a male lion and a male panther, I believe you could say panthers look feminine.) Even the necklace looks fine to me. Plus, I'm absolutely loving the eyes, the eyebrows, the fangs and the ears.<br />
<br />
I just feel so jealous when looking at the tauren cat forms... You used different colors with them, why not also with nelves, Blizz? Why should nelves stick with just purple when the tauren have actually something to choose from instead of just sticking to the previous yellow/brown as nelves are now? I would've liked to see a bluish-white cat, a dark blue cat or a greenish cat(!) or purely black cat (which almost actually is there, thank god...) All I see now is a pink-white cat, purple-black cat, purple cat, another purple cat and, again, a purple-black cat. And could you tell me why the purple cat has green markings when there's nothing else green in it? Nelves change based on hair color, right? Why not make the fur color based on the hair color then, instead of skin color? Taurens needed more radical change, I get it, but is there a reason for leaving nelves so much behind?<br />
<br />
My character has blue skin and white hair and I have no idea why she should change purple when shapeshifting. And if I changed the hair color green, why is the purple still there? Okay, actually there's nothing wrong with purple, I wouldn't mind if you used it with 1 or 2 skins, but because it's everywhere... Makes me a bit sad.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm glad Blizz finally made these new skins. (Going to dye my druid's hair dark blue btw. Or let's see how the 'white' cat looks like when going live because I really like the light-brown bear...) And I won't reroll tauren because of this, no way, but I can see myself making a tauren druid alt... which probably won't make really far past lvl 20.</div></div><hr />

Not only compared to the old ones, but overall. Maybe night elf models have some weird elements like temples hair for bears and those neckbells for cats, but that's it.<br />
Second of all, 'tis Tauren who should complain about WTH?! is with their cat form, not elves. Elves got cheetah/puma form which neither require nor has any specific gender signs, while your girls look like guys (aye, only male lions have SUCH a mane) in their feral form, pfft.<br />

Please shift your pretty female tauren OUT of whatever the hell form it's in, take off your cloak/chest/tabard and LOOK at your neck and back.<br />

YOU WERE BORN WITH A MANE. GET OVER IT.<br />
<br />
If you look at the Nelf forms, they too have manes of a sort; a strip of colored hair going down the back. Representing (you guessed it) THEIR HAIR.<br />
<br />
Oh, I'm female too, and to be honest, they've scaled back the &quot;mane&quot; just enough. People are just being ridiculous now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for nelf ppl. you are pinkskinned. im sorry but you are. and you emulate a panther, a cat that is long lean and built for stealth ambushes in both the male and female. in the real world their isn't a great deal of sexual dimorphism so that's just what they look like. panthers are the chosen template for nelf models. <br />
<br />
their bear template appears to be a brown or black bear, fitting for the more arboreal setting of their lifestyle.<br />
<br />
<br />
taurens on the other hand live on the plain with ranging moutains surrounding them<br />
<br />
is it any surprise that their template for cat form would be a lion? lions as some of you may or may not know show a large amount of sexual dimorphism in what i like to call the real world, and as we've seen in the barrens in WoW too. males are larger and more powerfully built and have great big manes. they are not hunters like male panthers but rather defenders. it makes sense that of the two the taurens would choose to emulate the male lions rather then females. after all taurens are comparatively peaceful and only seek to defend their home and friends.<br />
<br />
their bear template appears to be a grizzly or some sort of mountain bear owing to the mountainous terrain they took 'em from. grizzlies are, last i checked, huge fucking bears that look mean as all get out. pretty masculine-looking<br />
<br />
<br />
so you are all bitching that grizzlys look more masculine then brown bears and male lions look more masculine then panthers.<br />
<br />
congratulations, you just stated the obvious. <br />
<br />
even without the damned lore, you dont need to know WHY each race choose a different template for their forms. just know that nelfs are panthers/brown bears and taurens are male lions/grizzly bears. im going to bet that if ToL form comes next then nelf ToL will look more like a deciduous tree like an oak or something while taurens will get something more akin to joshua tree or something of that nature. <br />
<br />
will you all complain that nelf trees are all covered in too many leaves and girly looking while the taurens bitch that they look gnarled and dead?<br />
<br />
different races, different views on power. stop complaining when real life interferes with your desires<br />
<br />
<br />
also i misspelled &quot;there&quot; as &quot;their&quot;, sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually my only gripe is that the combination of cat/bear form form that I want (grey bear, white cat) is not possible for female tauren. There are three male tauren skins that get that combination, but 0 female.<br />
<br />
Kinda ridiculous that female tauren have less skin choices than males. :(</div></div><hr />

Now that everyone has had a chance to check out the new art for druid cat and bear forms, we'd like to share with you the current break down of tauren skin tones and night elf hair colors associated with each form color.

They're working on it. Bear&amp;Cat had priority because those were the oldest forms (if you ignore that NElf owl and tree and recycled) and had the most voices asking for an update. Expect new owl and tree skins in 3.3 or rather 3.4</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Farelle</div><div class="date">2009-08-26, 12:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i can understand why some people are complaining about NE forms O.o<br />
<br />
im a girl myself AND a had an education in graphics and the thing im the best at, are colors....<br />
<br />
also i know some things about 3D modelling and texturing...<br />
<br />
and honestly, blizzard made already better forms.....<br />
<br />
<br />
but....at all i like the 3D model, its really better than the old one^^ and textures seems to be sharper and fine now...BUT the colors makes no sense at all.....ok pink and white fits together...but i made a nightelf with blue skin and white hair, because i dont like pink O.o so where does the pink in the white cat form comes from?<br />
<br />
and green,pink AND red doesnt fit in one bear form O.o that hurts really bad and abuse everyone who knows how a color circle works...<br />
<br />
well...i can understand that its easier to implement if you change skin color with hair color instead of adding a tab to barbier. but atleast a skin, hair combine would help to add more individuality and to avoid colors you dont want, maybe....<br />
<br />
<br />
and these bracelets, make it look like a domesticated pet....it should be more like feather jewelery like on birds form, so it looks more nature like....these spiked bracelets dont fit in the whole wow world...who is wearing such thingies?<br />
<br />
<br />
and well...there should be possibilities of adding other structures on bear skin, cause these two stripes on his back makes him look like a badger....<br />
<br />
<br />
the rest: i just heard animations should be like broken legs but i cant say anything to it before I've seen it myself...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
actually, its not that i really dislike the new form...but i REALLY dont like pink, and im playing an NE because i thought about them as a mysterious race not as funky and barbiegirl race....<br />
<br />
and for the people who says that NE s have pink anyway.....what about humans? isnt their skin a bit pink sometimes? or some trolls? but i dont think they wanted to be stuck with a lvl 80 PINK armor the rest of the gamers life or? :P<br />
<br />
the things whats missing with &quot;gay&quot; comments is, that its not really constructive critism ;) so not really helpful, just whining</div></div><hr />
