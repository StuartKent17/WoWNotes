MamyTwink (http://www.mamytwink.com/actualite/patch-6-2-interview-de-cory-stockton) had the opportunity to talk to Cory Stockton (@mumper (https://twitter.com/mumper/with_replies)) recently. We have recapped the more interesting parts below, but watch the full thing for more context! <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;125&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Afak_npfXo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Expansions and Raids<br />
<br />
Hellfire Citadel is currently planned to be the last raid of the expansion. <br />
It wraps up things and it is hard to beat Archimonde as a final boss. <br />
Players saw Tanaan Jungle at the start of the expansion and are wrapping back around to it now.<br />
Anything can happen between now and whatever the team does next, but Hellfire Citadel is the pinnacle of where players are getting to. <br />
There isn't anything to announce about future patches, but part of that comes down to how Patch 6.2 plays out. How far players progress in Hellfire Citadel and Tanaan Jungle will give the team an idea of how long the content will last.<br />
Some expansions had four big patches, some had three, Warlords had two big patches with Patch 6.1 and 6.2. As the team gets closer to hitting the goal of a small gap between expansions there will be less large patches in each expansion. <br />
The team isn't happy with players having to wait a year for new content. <br />
Long waits aren't something they ever want to do, but the team was working on the new expansion and they weren't going to release it until it is at the right quality level. That isn't an excuse for the long wait, but it is better to wait two more months to have a great expansion rather than releasing it earlier and ending up with many issues. <br />
Farahlon was a cool idea, but it didn't really fit into the story being told. <br />
Tol Barad didn't make it in the game until Cataclysm, but the team was talking about adding it during Wrath of the Lich King. It just didn't fit the story until then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
<br />
The Mage Tower has felt underpowered for a long time. The power it offers in terms of completing naval missions may not be exactly where they want it yet.<br />
Similar to Battle Pets, followers don't need more levels. Followers are content themselves, so more content is added by adding more followers and missions rather than requiring more upgrades. <br />
Overall, the team is happy with garrisons. There are things that they would have done differently though. <br />
Moving forward they will look at the parts of the garrison system that worked well to see how they can offer new gameplay that is exciting. <br />
Building a building, assigning a follower to the building, and sending followers on missions felt new and fresh, but in the end players figured out how to optimize it. <br />
The team wants to continue to engage players in new ways, so not every part of garrisons will move forward, but the things that players really liked might. <br />
<br />
<br />
Legendary Items<br />
<br />
The team is currently making legendary items that everyone has access to, but that doesn't mean they will never go back to the old model for specific classes. They are just trying something different for now.<br />
The concept right now is to have an item that is updated with every patch and then reward something really good at the end of the expansion. Earning it requires playing through all of the content in an expansion. <br />
Earning the legendary item right now feels good, but it doesn't have the same feeling as the old legendary items.<br />
The journey of earning the legendary item is on each character, so making the item account bound rather than character bound is unlikely. <br />
Raids are not tuned around everyone having the legendary ring. The team can estimate how many people will have the ring on average when the raid comes out and then tune the raid around that. If the tuning is off, it can be hotfixed right away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
The WoW Token has worked out well. It lets players with extra gold safely buy game time for gold and players with extra money but no time safely purchase gold from other players.<br />
Mythic dungeons need a little bit of tuning, but overall the tuning is sufficiently challenging. <br />
Completing 5 Timewalking Dungeons could give players a Normal difficulty cache in the future in addition to the extra Bonus Roll. <br />
The team would love to do more things with Gul'dan in the future. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic Hellfire Citadel Progression<br />
Method is moving quickly today, already at 7/13 before the day is over. Midwinter and Paragon are close behind at 6/13. So far nine guilds have killed Kilrogg, putting them at 5/13. You can keep up with the latest progress on WoWProgress (http://www.wowprogress.com/), our forum thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1805328-Hellfire-Citadel-Mythic-Progression-Thread), and Manaflask (http://manaflask.com/en/articles/hellfire-citadel-tier-18-mythic-progress-limit-ascension-midwinter-at-3-13).<br />

More than likely. So not only do we have less content implemented during the expansion, I expect we're still going to get a shitty long wait anyway.</div></div><hr />

Remember--those tokens come from somewhere, and that somewhere is subbed people paying real money for you, basically.<br />

The only real way to send the message is to let your sub lapse.</div></div><hr />

I bet they didn't know it was going to be Blizzard that did it.<br />

- focus on movie<br />
- focus on free to play (cash to win/excel) games<br />
<br />
What about Wow Blizzard? It's the game that made you all mega stars and made Blizzard what is it. All those fans, and you keep announcing these utterly crappy F2P games with shops. It's a complete disgrace. And what about Wow? The worst 2 patches we have ever seen and that's it? You didn't learn anything with Mop and crap patches as your subs stayed above your limits. Now, I would not be so sure? You always rely on your Wow fans to bring you up to financial level. Now? let's see how this plays out. I predict we will hit an under 5 million sub count, and it will be less than that without the skewing. <br />

You should see the classic realm Blizzard, they are alive and fun to play.</div></div><hr />

I have been down on Cataclysm for years, because it devolved into a horrid pile of mush really fast. I apologize to everyone who I ever said that to. Cataclysm was a tour de force of amazingness and awesome compared to what happened with WoD just now. They said they had hired a larger team to work on the game, but they must have hired the JV squad, because this is atrocious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well they just had to release patches and raids instead of nothing...<br />
<br />
in Wrath they never released a proper Nerubian raid, they never released the troll raid. They forgot about the Neptulon raid in Cata.<br />
<br />
There is so much content in every expansion that they could have released. Guess selling an expansion box is just their main goal.</div></div><hr />

When you had 1-3 legendaries in the entire raid, main swapping or bringing in someone new was no big deal, now the first checkmark on the app is legendary progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The really dropped the ball from MoP. Too bad, because it seems they're not going to learn something from all this either. Guess it's a good thing that WoD will end sooner rather than later, but I wouldn't be surprised if we get to wait just as long for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

We want roughly 4 decent tiers with 4-6 months in between and MAX 6 months of last tier before expansion hits. CONSTANT CONTENT. And not pay 12*15 Dollars or EUR or whatever + 60 Dollars a year for shitty, half-assed content..................... 6.1 BIG PATCH, my ass. <br />

OK don't get this at all, what is this bullshit?<br />
<br />
In the last interview they said 6.1 should of been 6.0.5? As it had no content, now its was a BIG patch?<br />

6.1 was the worst patch in WoW history and now its a BIG patch?<br />

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK are they talking about?<br />

<br />
IF we wait 12 months this time for next xpac this time around, I give up on Blizzard. They gave us two raids at release(one that was delayed) and now HFC in 6.2, with Tanaan in it. 6.1 was a utter joke and dont need to be mentioned. I think that wotlk patch where the voice chat system patch came is better. That says alot.<br />
<br />
If they dont show us some damn info about the next xpac in 3-4 months TOPS, we will get next xpac in about 1 year from now. Im starting to think that the best of the best aint working at Blizzard. Either that or the leaders of Blizzard has gotten moneygreedy and think of nothing else.</div></div><hr />

No, it's absolutely not fine.<br />
<br />
Why should we settle for LESS content for MORE money than what we had 3-4 years ago? <br />
<br />
Not only that but people are still levelling alts, or just gearing them again and they have to do it in 6 months time again? Nah, I don't think so. There's a reason expansions should last roughly 2 years - but that does not mean there should be no new content the last 12-14 months of it. <br />

I'd have preferred to see something comparable to Tanaan come out or if they'd introduced Mythics, etc. at that time, but it likely wasn't ready. People seem upset and shocked that they're saying HFC is supposed to be the final raid, as if we didn't have over a year to come to grips with this. What did people expect, that Tom Chilton was just kidding a year ago when he said they wanted to cut it to two raids and two, maybe three major revisions?<br />
<br />
The upside of this is they'll hopefully limit the downtime until next xpac. I'd be content with an Expansion Announcement at PAX Prime or Blizzcon followed by a brief closed beta and a release in Q1 or Q2 of next year. Just depends on where they are with development and iteration, I suppose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in Wrath they never released a proper Nerubian raid, they never released the troll raid. They forgot about the Neptulon raid in Cata.<br />
<br />
There is so much content in every expansion that they could have released. Guess selling an expansion box is just their main goal.<br />
<br />
They didn't forget about Neptulon, they cut him out, cataclysm was suppose to be about both Deathwing AND Azshara, his entire sigment made no sense in the first place after they took Azshara out, FFs he gets captured twice! At the entrence after a huge event he gets captured and there is nothing you can do, you go after him and he is...fine? then gets captured again at the end of that instance.<br />
<br />
They are saving him for when they do the Azshara expansion, which is probably the next one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This either means they're working on the expansion or they have no fucking clue what they're doing and no major plan, which is truly troubling.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lihborg</div><div class="date">2015-07-02, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hold the phone, what did 6.1 add? I swear no one uses twitter integration anyways?!? We essentially had a launch (6.0,6.0.2,6.0.3) where we had Highmaul and garrisons and garrison campaigns and BRF was ready at launch too, but added just before 6.1 was released. In 6.1 we had an awful addition of garrison traders that to this day people don't understand how they work. Aside from that they added a selfie cam and twitter integration. Am i missing anything, I don't think so.<br />
<br />
6.2 we got Tanaan which was supposed to drop at launch, and while its a nice change of pace compared to how bleak WoD has been so far I wouldn't call it amazing compared to other mid expansion patches. 4.3 was by comparison much better and it just improved one zone instead of adding a whole new one. Yes its nice with more reps, more rares and faster gearing for alts, timewalking was fun too, but why make it for 3 days? I know many people play more during the weekend, but dropping a whole new patch and then adding timewalking that same weekend was a poor choice as loads of people most likely missed out. If this is the end of the expansion a lot of people will simply unsub. We've been delivered a poor expansion even by MoP standards and making it so short, with only 8 dungeons (NO scenarios), 3 raids, dreadful artwork on gear (i mean come on compared to the T1-3 and so many of the tbc wotlk sets the stuff they gave us is pure garbage), not to mention the lore going to hell. Whats up with Grom being accepted as a chill dude after he committed genocide for half the expansion? <br />
<br />
And then he talks about some of the positives of garrisons... I called it in beta no one is gonna enjoy garrisons in the long run its just a enlarged version of the mop garden and people only did that for rewards. Look at Ashran, we complained and complained and complained and complained, but we still got the same zergstorm that was so visable in beta and aside from the odd casual enjoying a 100man laggfest most agreed it wasnt fun pvp - not even gonna mention the 2hour queues. PvP has gone down the pooper too, I knew so many people including myself that spent time in pvp since tbc--&gt;mop but WoD was just the worst for arenas and RBGs. No new arenas or even a bloody BG has left PvP looking like my great aunt mary after two pina coladas - drunk and reliving the glory days.<br />
<br />
What can we expect? Well probably Farahlon with a small hub that introduces more reskins of boars, wolves and maybe a talbuk if we're lucky, and ofcourse a brand new sexy $20 store mount with a unique skin and awesome animations. Yah micro transactions are nice and they're needed, but it should be fluff to an already polished game not fluff to a game that was throughout its entirety of the expansion has lacked basic understanding of what players want.<br />
<br />
If you've read this much then thanks, i know it sounds like a lot of hating, and it is. Im sick and tired, ive played since vanilla, lost comrades in tbc, more in wotlk, a lot in cata, the bulk in mop and i'm nearly the last man standing in WoD. At the rate its gone i'll probs unsub the day i kill Archi on mythic, which won't be so far off considering we're allready halfway through heroic. At least with my massive gold stash i'll be able to spend gold on tokens instead of real money.<br />
<br />
Signing off, a sad and disgruntled player, who will most likely unsub :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Some expansions had four big patches, some had three, Warlords had two big patches with Patch 6.1 and 6.2. As the team gets closer to hitting the goal of a small gap between expansions there will be less large patches in each expansion.<br />
The team isn't happy with players having to wait a year for new content.&quot;<br />
<br />
So.. we need smaller gaps between expansions? Do we? That's a terrible idea and we are all victims of the cash grab models. This means, they can charge for more expansion and have to do less patching. It's just using the DLC model (which I and many find disgusting) and wrapping it up in a package that fools you into thinking you have epic content for a long time. Be careful Blizzard, the big games with DLC do not command a monthly fee. <br />
<br />
I, and many fans of the once great video game World of Warcraft (RIP) are happy to pay the monthly fee as the quality of the expansions and patches used to be very high. Neither of which are true now.<br />
<br />
Now the last point I highlighted:<br />
<br />
&quot;The team isn't happy with players having to wait a year for new content.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wait.. WHAT? Do we have direct quotes on that? That is very disturbing. That means, they milk on monthly, spend all their money developing the movie and the F2P cash store models and they are not happy we have to wait a year for more shoddy content?<br />
<br />
Blizzard FFS:<br />
<br />
The model is: we pay you a fortune every month and you make a great game. That is all there is to it. That is currently and since a long time, no longer the case.<br />
<br />
We pay to:<br />
<br />
- not hear your pathetic excuses and you being super defensive all the time, mostly about directions you have taken the game in that clearly is not what the general public want<br />
- not hear about why you think adhering to social media has ANYTHING to do with an MMORPG game. It's complete and utter bullshit and a waste of your time and our money<br />
- be entertained? It's not happening, why are you not coming out and saying the game is bad and you messed up? Why? <br />
- Not spend all your time on the movie. We would like to see the Wow film, but it's 90 mins of action, we played the game for 300 days /played and more, a movie is nothing but a fun couple of hours<br />
- Feel that our characters (from whenever we all signed up) are maturing and progressing<br />
- that the world is not this one we live in in RL.<br />
- that the world is some place we want to escape to after work/school rather than a button we push on desktop then open a window and have a list of things to do before we go to bed? <br />
- that you are able to entertain us. This has gone. When it comes back, we pay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why should we settle for LESS content for MORE money than what we had 3-4 years ago? <br />
<br />
Not only that but people are still levelling alts, or just gearing them again and they have to do it in 6 months time again? Nah, I don't think so. There's a reason expansions should last roughly 2 years - but that does not mean there should be no new content the last 12-14 months of it. <br />
<br />
Don't let Blizzard fool you like this.<br />
If I need to pay for an expansion so I don't get 14 months of a raid I am 100% fine with it.<br />
<br />
If it means there are no content luls I am fine with it.<br />

<br />
im predicting the next expansion will release a month or two before the movie. if they released it two months before the movie that would make this raid tier last roughly 10 months right? thats probably acceptable in blizzards minds.</div></div><hr />

This expansion had such potential, and it looks like it might be squandered due simply to lack of content.<br />
<br />
I know one thing - as much as I'm enjoying Tanaan, Mythic 5-mans, and HFC, I can only see myself playing this patch for 3, maybe 4 months, before I start wanting new content. I'm not going to pay 15 bucks a month to hang out in my garrison waiting for something to do.<br />

WoW is a great game. It could stay relevant for years to come. But content is the lifeblood of any MMO, and Blizz is failing spectacularly in that all-important category.</div></div><hr />

So they are not happy with the mage tower's power when it comes to completing missions. Sounds like a nerf incoming.<br />
Yeah, I agree the garrisons idea was fresh and new. But in the end let's blame the players how it all turned out.<br />
I'm glad the team is happy with garrisons, to bad a lot of your player base isn't. (how out of touch can they be?)<br />
<br />
I'm glad they said some of the things they said and it gives me a little faith back. But it still sounds like they are trying to go towards a raid or die mentality and that will totally leave me out. If they do that going forward it will be without me.<br />

Meh, I'm still salty about something they said in their blog about putting flying back in. They devs had decided on no more flying but then THEY (the devs) started thinking about never being able to use certain mounts again and changed their minds.

Well then, fine sir, you are part of the reason why WoW is getting considerably worse for each year. You'll pay them almost no matter what they do. Getting half of what we used to for double the price is just not cool. <br />

Also add in the fact that people have to re-level characters each year instead of playing end-game content, where most of the fun is.</div></div><hr />

Thats not true at all, I know a ton of people that unsubbed and never came back. There will always be a new influx of players and returning players that come back after burnout or feeling done after killing the last boss of the expansion. Wow's quality has declined for a while and thats been noticeable in the amount of subs the lowpoint being losing 2.9million subs from 6.0 to 6.1, so don't come here and say that eye candy brings people back, it'll bring back a handful, but most wont return. I'd argue that since WoD was so dreadful any returning veteran from vanilla-wotlk won't ever return again after seeing this crap.</div></div><hr />

To be fair Diablo 3 has become quite an amazing game with a big patch in PTR making things even better. Diablo has been in an upward spiral since Reaper of Souls released... Quite an amazing turn-around. It's evident that the dev team listens to their audience and find genious ways of fixing issues the players have. <br />

When the next expansion rolls around they're gonna shoot back up to about 10-11 million subs anyway in the misguided hope that the game will go back to how it used to be or get better, but by then it's too late, everyone has already bought a copy of the game and a months game time, people unsub, new raid comes out, people sub, complete, unsub, circle continues.</div></div><hr />

I am a huge supporter of Blizzard, but having this expansion end here is flat out unacceptable. Three raids in an entire expansion? Three? Really? MoP had 5, Cata had 6, WotLK had 9, BC had 8. Each expansion has had at least 3 tiers of gear.<br />

Ever since BC Blizzard has said that they want there to only be a year between expansions and for content to come out more quickly, but they haven't pulled it off. You can't simultaneously raise the price and reduce the content you get.</div></div><hr />

I know right?! The interviewer asked him three times and only on the third time did he approach actually answering the question.

Starting to feel like we're going to have a gap closer raid or a rehashed Sunwell/Karazhan.<br />

It's really impossible for them to state a fact apparently... &quot;currently planned&quot;.. &quot;but we look closely if people need more content&quot;.<br />

<br />
Also, I remember having an argument with some guy a few months ago on these forums about HFC being the final raid tier of the expansion. I told him that from PTR testing it certainly looked like it was the last tier and he kept arguing that it definitely wasn't because Big Daddy Chilton said that Grom would be the final boss of the expansion. I informed him that we save Grom in HFC and that there was pretty much no way he could be the last boss of the expansion and his responses were basically, &quot;But my daddy, Tom Chilton, told me that Grommash would be the last boss! Archimonde isn't Grommash! You're a dumb dumb!&quot; I wish I could find that guy now and say, &quot;I told you so,&quot; or something much worse...</div></div><hr />

Think about it, if the downward trend continues, we'll soon be sitting at 5 mil subs or less. They'd have to gain 5 mil subs+ in one fell swoop to do that, and consumer/gamer confidence in the WoW team is at an all time low. It's worse than Cata.

<br />
We start off with Vanilla. In Vanilla we had, by the end of the &quot;game&quot;, 20 dungeons and 5 raids.<br />
TBC we had 16 dungeons and 7 raids (counting Gruul and Mag as one raid).<br />
WotLK had 16 dungeons (some rehashed) and 5 raids (counting all the dragon raids as one total raid).<br />
Cata had 14 dungeons (again some rehashed) and 5 raids.<br />
MoP had 9 dungeons (some were rehashed) and 5 raids.<br />
WoD has 8 dungeons (one rehashed) and 3 raids.<br />
<br />
WoD was the most expensive expansion to date, it was more expensive than the original game, and clearly the content has been lacking.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to step their game up with this next expansion they release or I think they are going to see a mass exodus (more than what's already occuring).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2015-07-02, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would they do big patches and not get paid for them, when they can just shift all that development into the next expansion where they get paid.<br />
<br />
This is the new system, you get an expansion for $50, 6 months later you get a raid patch, then you get a new expansion for $50.<br />
<br />
Players always have this problem of not thinking things through on what they wish for ´ we want faster expansions´.. well, here you go... Blizzard is more than happy to throw them at you every 12 months for $50, with little free content in the middle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bullshit. <br />
<br />
I'd rather have more large patches and longer between expansions than one and a half big patches.<br />
<br />
Chalk it up to politics man, Activision knows that WoW is an old game and they're trying to juice it. We've seen them upcharge an expansion that only had two raid tiers and was overall extremely weak on content. <br />
<br />
I think it's fair to assume that the majority of WoW players are fed up with the antics that were performed. This was by far the biggest insult to the fan base ever, my hopes for future WoW expansions has greatly diminished.<br />

Are they STILL saying this and expecting us to believe it? Every expansion since Wrath they've been 'working on getting content out faster!' and 'planning more frequent expansions!' and every time they fail to deliver.

I really am curious how big a team has to get and how trained the members have to be before you realize what they say is just a bunch of excuses. They owe the players more than they've given them, way fuckin' more.<br />
<br />
Let's get something perfectly clear here, if the next expansion takes just as long as the previous, than you're going to know that this game is exactly what Call of Duty is. A shitty, yearly release of the same garbage that the same people eat up, with a whole lot less in it. Unfortunately it seems people are finally getting tired of it. So I guess we'll find out if they'll finally choose to stop being lazy now that they're losing money.</div></div><hr />

This is such an obivious cop out, it kinds of makes me shamed in your stead. It is like, you have decided that this is the final raid tier, like a few days ago before the release of 6.2. Believe me, if we don't have another proper raid that we kill Gul'dan and wrap this expansion up, like really wrap it up instead of thsi Cory bullshit that &quot;lalala you killed archimnode what more do u want&quot; i will never ever pay you more than i should. That is, i will not be buying CE's or Deluxe Editions or keep my sub up between content patches. I will just buy the cheapest online version and keep my sub to minumum, just so you dont get away with this &quot;get more money producing less content&quot; and sugarcoating it &quot; faster expansions&quot;.

Overall though I feel cheated. This expansion has been the worst outside of the raid content and that's the one thing they're removing from it. In essence I'll have paid more for an expansion that has delivered less content than ever before. This is exacerbated when you consider that 6.1 was barely a content patch, and 6.0 consisted of a lot of negative content (abilities removed, flying &quot;removed,&quot; dailies removed, the old profession system removed, etc).</div></div><hr />

You have been playing on and off since Vanilla so you have stopped playing the game during what was considered the best xpacs that WoW has had so would not surprise me that you would never sub again.

What they are counting on, and it worked for WoD, is that people will see ´the new expansion´ as an opportunity for Blizzard to learn anything. Players are horrible about listening to marketing and thinking that maybe the Devs will make things better in the next expansion.. and then they pay $50 and the crap repeats itself.<br />
<br />
Some things make sense now... Why the beancounters out Blizzard would be willing to grow the WOW development team so much... the answer is that they are no longer going to do free content patches, all those new employees will be doing nothing but pushing out a $50 small expansion every year.</div></div><hr />

So your saying that no one will say they started raiding in 6.0 or that they started playing wow in 6.0! 6.0 is a patch and that is the reason they mini patches for hotfixes in 6.0 are not called 6.1 they are called 6.0.1 or 6.0.2 because it's a patch!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There isn't anything to announce about future patches, but part of that comes down to how Patch 6.2 plays out. How far players progress in Hellfire Citadel and Tanaan Jungle will give the team an idea of how long the content will last.<br />
<br />
<br />
How far can people progress in a zone like Tanaan? That makes no sense to me, same thing with raiding. At some point you just get to the end and don't want to run it anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Some expansions had four big patches, some had three, Warlords had two big patches with Patch 6.1 and 6.2. As the team gets closer to hitting the goal of a small gap between expansions there will be less large patches in each expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quality over quantity. Personally I don't mind waiting for something worth my money and time. WoD was neither. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Long waits aren't something they ever want to do, but the team was working on the new expansion and they weren't going to release it until it is at the right quality level. That isn't an excuse for the long wait, but it is better to wait two more months to have a great expansion rather than releasing it earlier and ending up with many issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with this. It is better to wait longer for something worthwhile. However WoD was NOT worth the wait. This expansion feels rushed, I can't imagine what would have happened if it had been released on time. <br />
In fact if the next expansion isn't at the quality of previous expansions I'd be happy to wait and wonder around Draenor until they get the next one perfect, I'm fine with that honestly. I just don't ever want to see another turd like WoD released.</div></div><hr />

It makes absolutely no sense if you raid. He just shows up on Archimonde trash (Mount Hyjal Bosses) as allied with Yrel and Khadgar for no reason. At all. In ICC, there were random screams that were significant to the lore to expound on the story. There's nothing close to a story in HFC. Like, I can't imagine anyone liking this &quot;story&quot;.<br />
<br />
To be fair, he didn't just &quot;show up&quot;...if you paid attention, he was being tortured during the Fel Lord fight and you save him. Now the redemption part of it does need some explaining but he didn't just randomly show up like you are making it out to be. <br />
<br />
To me, it just seems like he was lead the wrong direction by Garrosh, once Garrosh died and Gul'dan seemed to overthrow him, I think Grommash realized the errors of his ways and took our side to stop Gul'dan. It would've been nice if there was a little story in between that to help show how we &quot;forgave&quot; him...this MIGHT be something we see in the final cinematic for the end of the Legendary chain (if such cinematic exists)</div></div><hr />

I agree, and hope players take this route. I for one am tired of being roped into the game by all their hype about xpacs and then completely let down. I know some think MoP was a awesome xpac, I am one of the ones who didnt and Cata was as bad if not worse. But this game has not been the same since WotLK, it started its spiral at the end of that xpac and has done nothing but go down since.<br />
<br />
Wake up Blizz. This is the beginning of the end if you don't start delivering.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough, I didn't notice that when I was raiding, but still, I did notice Gul'Dan summoning Mannoroth. Still, he may as well have shown up out of nowhere as our ally. Like, the idea that he gets off scot free after invading Azeroth and waging war on Draenor with no considerable redemption story like executing Mannoroth in a short cinematic or whatever, is stupid. Like, come on! There's no effort put into the story. Cool raids, but what does this expansion have positive to offer besides 3 cool raids and minor quality of life enhancements? The story wasn't told. It's kind of like if you go on a DVD and skip scene-to-scene. That's how the story feels. <br />
<br />
The cool stories that were told well, were in the starting zones, right? Shadowmoon had Velen doing a sacrifice which was pretty cool, though I didn't personally care for the obligatory woman hero Yrel that didn't do anything really cool like a Jaina or a Sylvanas. Even the brother of Durotan clan war story in Frostfire Valley which was such an insignificant story to the plot of Draenor, was fucking massively better told and more interesting than the entire expansion's story.</div></div><hr />

they are going to fewer big patches of content unlike how it was a whole bunch of different patches<br />
want players to experience new content faster<br />
not making more patches<br />
want to get expansions out faster<br />
want smaller expansions with less content and less of a story and want quicker expansions thus even smaller content less of a story<br />

1. Now we are gonna buy expansion once a year, lol? <br />
I loved the damn idea of expansion lasting for 4 years, but it had to be like Wotlk or Sunwell with 4 tiers! Like a new raid every 4-6 months. Wouldn't that be good? <br />
2. WoD had to be the best, and it turned out being absolutely &quot;plastic&quot;<br />
Dunno, it felt very unnatural to me. This whole new, basically, fictional world, where you can't fly after you reach 100 felt like a box in diff of all previuos expacs. And in the end.. we get the end before we even knew it was the end... Grommash wasn't the final villain as blizz sad. I like the unexpected turn, but IT IS UNFINISHED!<br />
It didn't feel good and now it didnt even end good. You scrapped Faralohn after taunting us with it! THE HELL, BLIZZ? <br />
Honestly, i had unsubbed like in december by the reason of times consuming (cuz i can't farm lfr, thats not enough for me, i need Myths), but now it knocks me away from returning. This is absolute bullshit! Its not finished! It wasn't natural!</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Hellfire Citadel is currently planned to be the last raid of the expansion. (WoD is more expensive exp with the least raids)<br />
- Anything can happen between now and whatever the team does next. (Anything means 18 months without content?)<br />
- How far players progress in Hellfire Citadel and Tanaan Jungle will give the team an idea of how long the content will last. (They wont change their plans whatever we do)<br />
- Warlords had two big patches with Patch 6.1 and 6.2. (6.1 a big patch? Insulting)<br />
- The team isn't happy with players having to wait a year for new content. (But they don't bother much with it neither)<br />
- Long waits aren't something they ever want to do, but [...] (Yes, there is always a but...)<br />
- Farahlon was a cool idea, but it didn't really fit into the story being told. (Because the history only had 2 patches)<br />
- The Mage Tower has felt underpowered [...] may not be exactly where they want it yet. (So they will change it in the next big patch, oh wait...)<br />
- Overall, the team is happy with garrisons. (Translation: Players feedback is pointless)<br />
- [...] but in the end players figured out how to optimize it. (So, players fault for optimizing a simple repetitive system so fast)<br />
- The team would love to do more things with Gul'dan in the future. (Yeah really? We hadn't noticed it yet!)<br />

Look I am NOT the biggest detractor of this expansion but BITCH PLEASE. Six point one was a 'oh crap here's the stuff we didn't finish development for the start of the expansion' and you know it.

I'm not even angry, i'm just disappointed. I personally like 6.2, but I still feel cheated. £10 extra for expansion 10% higher sub cost, 15% higher service cost and for what? a 1 patch expansion? An expansion I have my flight removed in. An expansion I have my favourite classes gutted in, the most enjoyable abilities that make my specs work removed. An expansion where i'm forced into the lagfest that is Ashran in order to pvp on a small scale. An expansion where I have to do attunements to do pretty much anything, which we pretty much all agreed after TBC were really fucking awful. Can't even get into Tanaan on my druid without first sitting waiting on 2k resources, forking over 5k gold and 2k resources to get a t3 garrison then respeccing to some boring boomkin spec to sit in a 45 min long quest chain just so I can kill Kazzak or explore it on that character.<br />

Isnt it then a complete 180 to say that 6.1 was a&quot;big&quot; content patch. Blizzard just seem so full of bs recently. Next expansion release will need to be confirmed by blizzcon otherwise will we be waiting a year for content.r</div></div><hr />

<br />
lmao &quot;great expansion&quot; my ass. What a joke of a company and game, no wonder the game is dying off.<br />
<br />
I think it's pretty obvious that they divided their team into two and one is always working on the next x-pac. So, no, those who are OK with paying for a new x-pac will probably not have long to wait. Yearly x-pacs was always their wild fantasy; I hated the idea and always planned on quitting if/when they ever achieved this dream of theirs. I don't want to have to level to max every year and I certainly don't want to pay for an x-pac every year in a game with a monthly fee. <br />
<br />
A shallower game was just a bad decision period. The problem isn't that they don't have devs at work, the problem is that they are working on the next x-pac so their collective brains and hearts aren't in this one. Bad plan that will cost them. I don't think a lot of actual players were hoping for yearly x-pacs, it was just something the devs kept bringing up when we said &quot;Where the hell is the next expansion?&quot;<br />
<br />
They are going to crash and burn on this one. The x-pac was too much and the flying/no-flying nonsense got the whole community riled up for no reason.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that any direction we're headed will be behind the influences of what we just came from? It won't be all like &quot;Hey guys this is just like the good old days again!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talyrius</div><div class="date">2015-07-03, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cory clearly meant two big raid tiers, not patches (or 6.0.2 and 6.2). However, they shouldn't have increased the cost of the expansion if they intended for it to only last half as long as they typically do.<br />
<br />
Their biggest fault is that they focus too much of their attention on raids. If the game is expected to hold our interest for more than a few weeks immediately following each content patch, we need a variety of compelling content made available to us. When there is less fun to be had outside of raids, there is less incentive to even raid at all! There needs to be a balance. Why don't they understand this?</div></div><hr />

It's one of those ways they use to slow you down so that you don't realize as quickly just how little content there is.<br />
<br />
Most people recognized the immersion line for the BS it was pretty early on, especially when it was pointed out just how immersive and fun WotLK and TBC were, even with flying. That excuse didn't smell right, and folks said then that it's probably because they rushed the expansion and that it was unfinished in some way. They were right. The only way to compensate for an expansion that costs more for half the content is to slow the players down so that less seems like more.<br />
<br />
I feel lucky. At least I enjoy leveling and raiding and I'm not much into PvP. The PvPers REALLY got screwed in this expansion. But as much as I enjoy leveling and raiding, I can't justify spending $15/month on what little is there. My lesson was learned. My sub runs out in August. I won't be renewing it, and I likely won't be buying the next expansion until months in when I know what I'm getting and after it's gone on sale. Nearly 8 years of a never-lapsing subscription, and it's gone in August. This is what WoW has come to.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Well i'll be damned. Seems like Blizzard has figured out that they rather make half assed content patches(and fewer) in each xpac and make money from box sales.<br />
<br />
That's pretty much the Activision business model. I can't say I'm surprised. I'm the parent of a child who plays Skylanders, after all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caerule</div><div class="date">2015-07-03, 01:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard seems so disconnected from their audience at times. Like, here on the audience side we, on average, can predict reactions pretty well (with wide outliers on either side), but Blizz is always surprised at the strong response players will have to things.<br />
<br />
In this case, the response is obvious. Less raid tiers than before. No promises of content between now, and the next expansion. A huge gap between expansions before this. Enormously reduced player loyalty to their subscription. WoW is going to bleed a lot of players. And I really don't want it to.<br />
<br />
This is just a horrible decision. It takes a lot longer to make a whole new expansion, than it takes to make a Timeless Isle, or a Ruby Sanctum. Giving -any- playable content whatsoever between now and 7.0 will keep people playing. &quot;Shorter, faster released expansions&quot; is the opposite of the ideal solution. The problem with MoP wasn't that the next expansion was so far away. It was that there was a gap. Delaying an expansion for a month or two is fine, if it's means a patch in between to keep us occupied.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Time Sage</div><div class="date">2015-07-03, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What they should be striveing for is less down time between patches. We don't need yearly expansions if the'res enough content to sate us in between. <br />
<br />
Gonna point to FFXIV. They just released their first expansion (Second if you consider the remake an expansion). The base game (of the remake) had 5 major patchs filled to the brim with new content and features, the last of which was so big it was split over 3 smaller patches. There was also a number of smaller patches adding alot of content. They also added an entire Class/Job in the form of Rogue/Ninja in the middle of the patch cycle rather then holding out for the expansion. This is how you support an expansion<br />
<br />
Also the expansion builds on the existing game world rather then feeling disconnected. The plot line continues directly from where the patch content left off and hanging plot threads created in the final patch are addressed, returning you to familer locations for a bit. This is in direct contrast to blizzard's &quot;Discard and Draw&quot; style of expansions where old content and locations are useless.<br />
<br />

<br />
Oh, and by the way, he is clearly signalling, despite the litany of complaints regarding both Garrison's and Shipyards, that the next lazy expansion will be chock full of this type of empty, mindless, and more importantly to Blizz non-resource intensive, content...so the quality of the game won't be getting better any time soon.<br />
<br />
While many may claim that rose coloured glasses are rampant among the older player base there is objectively, beyond even a doubt now, proof that Blizz is continuing down a path of more (costly game box expansion sales) that provide less and less meaningful content. Once you stop confusing QoL improvements with content it is plain to see. <br />
<br />
Just imagine Vanilla WoW with some (not all) of the QoL improvements and you'll see that WoW is just a shadow of its former self in its current iteration and the future is not looking bright (unless you enjoy being milked for every last cent by a company that no longer cares).</div></div><hr />

Also if HFC is the final raid, blizzcon is when November? So that's five months from now? So then an at best beta lasting until May assuming beta happens right after blizzcon.

This an an at best...they've released every expansion between September and January....there's no way they get the next expansion out before September so we're look at 15 months minimum of HFC....holy shit.</div></div><hr />

Even if they were to release WoW 2 (If WoW 2 were to work all your stuff would have to carry over to the new game) that would meant that we probably have to wait about 14 months for them to release it along with the WoW movie, because lets be honest here, thats probably whats going to happen (lol at the &quot;guerrilla&quot; marketing).<br />
<br />
A new expansion isn't going to happen in November because 6.2 just got released and we all know how long it takes for blizzard to get out beta. I can't tell if Blizzard is trying to kill their own game but it looks like they are succeeding.</div></div><hr />

Hell, BRF was launched BEFORE 6.1 and even before that, it was ready, just staggered (which is a fancy word for &quot;gated&quot;).<br />
<br />
Is the game really that unprofitable these days? Or is everybody at Blizzard simply sick of working on WoW?</div></div><hr />

Back in Wrath, a lot of us called that, and were called six kinds of fool. Well, here we are. Shorter, more frequent expansions is typical Activision. <br />
<br />
I've said since WoD launch day was announced, they were forcing the devs to rush, finished or not. For that, I'm not pissed at the devs. They're paying for Mike Morhaime's greed, and then on top of it, they have to give interviews and take the backlash.<br />
<br />
And Bobby Kotick's greed and Chris Metzen's greed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Man they really have zero clue at Blizzard or they dont care anymore or both.<br />
<br />
Hearthstone is shitting out money with little or not effort, and Heroes of the Shitstorm is milking money* off fanboys stupid enough to pay for incomplete, half-assed skins (The Butcher skins are a joke, and the models still feel incomplete despite the texture updates). As long as one or two games are making money (Wow and HS), they don't care if they make turds like this expansion, Diablo 3 (both vanilla and RoS because they really ruined RoS by bringing back/tuning up Jay Wilson's bullshit), and Heroes of the Shitstorm.<br />
<br />
*Which isn't going to last long because this game is really bad. Chat is dead, queue times are pretty bad, and no one [out of fanboys] is buying any of the shitty skins and mounts. Blizzard didn't give a damn about polishing HoTS; they wanted a quick cash cow that can be an &quot;e-sport&quot; (lol, e-sports: what a joke).</div></div><hr />

Content in FF XIV is vastly superior to WoW at this point, but the major draw is the community. <br />
<br />
Never have I seen such a welcoming and mature community in an MMO, the content is an added bonus, the real draw is the community.<br />
<br />
Agreed. I had been playing FF XIV free trial for a few days when the Ion/Lore interview happened, and I actually subscribed to FF XIV for 6 mos, bought the game, the collectors expansion, and a security token. I've been playing WoW since original beta and they've lost their way, imo. I don't even want to play WoD for free (and, thanks to garrisons, I could for quite some time).<br />
<br />
FF XIV may not be everyone's cup of tea, but I do feel the developers are connected to their players, whereas I really don't feel that way with WoW anymore. <br />
<br />
I now have a level 52 paladin in FFXIV, working my way though the main story line prior to the new expansion. Couldn't be happier, same for a friend who came over with me.<br />
<br />
I love WoW, but WoD has me shaking my head and the comments from the developers don't make me feel any better about the future.</div></div><hr />

ONE proper content patch throughout an expansion? And with Blizzard's unending iterations for making everything (in the background) perfect slows down expansion development regardless but players gets less things TO DO IN THAT CONTENT. Everything in WoD looks and plays absolutely stellar, that doesn't give the expansion any longevity!!<br />
<br />
Might be the final nail for me, because there's no chance in hell we're getting the next expansion within a year from now anyway. Drop this bullshit of pretending that &quot;yearly expansions&quot; is possible with your impossible standards and create something grand and a bit unpolished instead!<br />
<br />
If shit like BC dungeon hubs, LK one-room raids and copy-paste content does keep players occupied, DO IT. We get less and less separate instances of content but at the same time it all has to be perfectly balanced and planned out for you too.<br />
<br />
So incredibly self-destructive.</div></div><hr />

Diablo has been in an upward spiral since Reaper of Souls released... Quite an amazing turn-around. It's evident that the dev team listens to their audience and find genious ways of fixing issues the players have. <br />
<br />
Sad the exact opposite is true of the WoW dev team.<br />
<br />
And yet it got worse with each season carrying something &quot;pros&quot; exploit (Season 1 died before they ended it), the non-existing class balance (Demon Hunter and Barb builds only &quot;pros&quot;/attention whore streamers use, or fuck off), ruining item sets like Zunimassa, terrible itemization, and Jay Wilson-like ideas popping up in each patch (Jailers do damage and fuck awful mob layouts). Clans are the most pointless things in D3 because you can use your friend list to make games. I don't know how Blizzard went from shit -&gt; good -&gt; back to shit with Diablo 3, but they pulled it off. Not even the &quot;Not the Horadric Cube ORIGINAL IDEA GUYS!&quot; Cube and &quot;Not the Cow Level&quot; are going to bring back players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have a huge problem with there only being 2 tiers. I do have a problem with it being the last raid. They say they want to avoid the end of expansion gap and every time they fail. And seriously, we're barely a half a year into this expansion and its over already? Seriously?<br />

It really floored me to hear the devs talk like they were shocked at player behavior with garrisons, gold and alts. Considering how damn quickly it took to level from 90-100, I literally in a weeks time had my main and 6 other alts churning away at the garrison and had gold pouring in from my salvage yards for a few minutes of logging in and running follower missions. I know some people had *all* of their character slots filled with L100 alts so I can't even imagine the bankroll of some players after this expac.<br />

I'll bet 2 bags of sour skittles that Illidan shows up in this expansion. I don't know squat about lore, but with all of the TBC tie-in's and Guldan being banished or whatever happened in that cutscene, it could be lored-up that Illidan comes back with him/etc. That cutscene certainly eluded to Guldan coming back - I just think he's gonna be holding hands with Illidan. Let me rephrase - I don't know diddly about lore, nor care.<br />
<br />
This almost reeks of a distraction tactic (&quot;no no, nothing going on here&quot;) and when they announce Illidan/raid (blizzcon reveal?), people will lose their collective nostalgic shit. There was no hype about the endgame/story for 6.2 to be it. It's not like blizzard to forgo playing up the last (loose term) baddie we'd ultimately kill. Again, I don't care about lore, but I thought Guldan was going to go saiyan on us all at some point (final raid) and if that's not the case, then something else is. Either way, it ain't Archy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was the original dungeons (most of which we have seen remade in one fashion or another except DM?) , Stratholm (originally a raid), Spire (also a raid), MC, Ony, ZG, BWL, AQ20/40, Naxx. There was a fair amount of world content related to AQ. THREE legendaries (Thunderfury, Sulfuras, Naxx Staff; some might consider the hunter bow/staff legendary), actual world pvp and bgs with the people on YOUR server (I know a completely dead concept now but to me this made it meaningful). I'm sure I'm forgetting some stuff. We've seen a lot of this reused at this point and passed off as content.<br />
<br />
At this point we get maybe 2-3 full raids per expansion and one end game zone (Quel'Danas, Firelands, Timeless Isles, Talaan, etc.) and the dungeons are decent but nothing quite like the epic slog fests that Shadow Labyrinth and Hellfire Ramparts were (yes I've moved ahead to BC now because they reusing that content now and in my humble opinion picked the worst of it).<br />
<br />
Vanilla actually lasted 2.5-3 years so it was the equivalent to two expacs time now? BC was about 2 years length. Fairly comparable amount of content next to vanilla I'd say. I think people have just come to expect more content per expansion and now they have this accelerated timeline resulting in less overall per expansion and an increase in price. Eventually we'll be paying $50 per raid patch. I don't really understand why they would make an expansion's lifespan shorter than it was in the past other than to make more money, or a change of scenery/storyline (which in this case I am fine with because if I see a single fucking Orc in the NEXT expansion well fuck...). I guess that is the point I'm trying to make; A) we're getting less bang for the buck each expansion, and B) I am tired of Orcs... Horde... War... theme. The Emerald Dream could be so fucking cool and have weird dreaming trippy Night Elves and strange zones where the laws of physics and reality don't even apply (this is how you make zones meant for flying mounts PRO TIP). And also a clean slate for creative content. Yet they keep rehashing the same themes, bad guys, war, orcs, blah blah.</div></div><hr />

I understand the mentality of sticking it to the man by essentially playing the game for free but realize that you're still a sub and they're still making money off the fact that that token was bought.<br />

It just feels so weak coming from Blizzard, you really see that 1) either they're working on the next expansion and B team is taking over the reins of WoD 2) they've given up and are just going to milk as much as possible with no effort involved until the cow dies. It's so sad but yes, the game is old as hell, I just don't see how the are going to recover from this fail. I don't consider WoD to be a bad expansion, cataclysm has that. But seeing what they've done so far with patch 6.1 and 6.2 it's so much wrong and shortcuts taken. I've already bought FFXIV and planning on playing that instead. I can't say &quot;I'm going to cancel my wow subscription BabyRage&quot; because I can't really do that, I have over 1000 days of subscription on my wow account.<br />

There has to be more than just &quot;raiding&quot; in a mmo these days. Even a f2p does better than that. It's so generic in wow, the same crap every expansion, nothing really new and exciting.
