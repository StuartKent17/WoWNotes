What's sad about that? It's only US and EU regions. Asia not included where the bigger playerbase is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In what way.<br />
If you take that as some representation of sub numbers, then consider that a week ago there was another poll with 4.9m.<br />
Which shows those only to be a SAMPLE of the whole, which as stated is at the very least excluding anything which is not EU or US.<br />
So if that is what you are saying, then the jumping to such conclusions would be what is &quot;sad&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Yes, and it was about characters, this one is about active accounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough, I missed that distinction.<br />
But it has been stated on previous occasions to be only a sample.<br />
Jumping to the conclusion that it is all accounts would be wrong.<br />
<br />
That is evidence of nothing at all on its own.<br />
Do we really think that wow players on average are spending about 4 or 5 times their subscription a month on pets, mounts, account services, etc.<br />
As that is what would be required given the apparent income from the game overall.<br />
<br />
I find that hard to believe, not least because I am very far from that supposed typical example.</div></div><hr />

not a lot of them, but there are enough &quot;whales&quot; around that spend a hell of a lot more, just a RMAH mount is usually going for the equivalent of 4-5 tokens on it's own, and I've yet to see one not being sold for minimum that (and for each one that got sold, at least a few tokens were bought for cash and sold on the AH by the people who didn't win that.</div></div><hr />

Millions were made by players with garrisons alone, who unlike me took full advantage of that.<br />
The more you have, the more you can make.<br />
There is no evidence as to how much of the spending on the RMAH comes from tokens.<br />
<br />
All we have are assumptions.<br />
And given the previous player behaviour we aren't likely to get much more transparency on that than we are now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as one of those who banked millions during WoD i agree with you on principal, the RMAH was just an example of a huge gold sink that can be used from tokens. (i am also personally aware of at least 5 people who work for decent wages, and spend about 100 eu/month on tokens just because they don't want to do anything remotely close to grinding (and they enjoy throwing down feasts and cauldrons in 5mans for some reason)<br />
<br />
as an aside, i'd like to point out that, <br />
1. at least for me, the WoD gold is mostly gone, most of it spent on tokens for sub and b-net balance. <br />
2. it is possible, if you leveled enough characters to 110 and kept up with your Order Hall resource gathering and upgrades, to make 300-400k/month just from playing about an hour/week on each character (just enough for a full round of emissary quests + some OH WQ to keep the ball rolling) and spending about 10 minutes each day on the mobile app setting up missions.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alfakennyone</div><div class="date">2017-05-21, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Almost Prestige 8</div></div><hr />

<br />
The majority probably. Let's be honest here, 30% have barely participated in pvp at all. That is the amount of people in my guild that do zero pvp and just did it a couple of times for either the weapon skin or some loot from a tower/open world arena. <br />
<br />
If you actually pvp regularily, then you'd have about 10 at least by now, you should probably be done with 13-50 as well. <br />
<br />
All these numbers tell me is that the new system is a failure and more to the point PvP in WoW is an utter failure, because no one does it. Maybe blizzard will stop wasting nice items on it in the future, because apparently even giving the bad ass colors of tier sets to PvP is not enough to get people to actually participate in it. Heck even high class raiding seems to get more attention that casual PvP.. let alone dedicated.<br />
<br />
The only saving grace is probably that the 1.9 million do contain a couple of twinks, which also don't pvp by the looks of it, but will obviously skew the numbers a bit.<br />
<br />
P12-L10 myself btw.</div></div><hr />

nothing usurprising there - Broken shore is complete garbage not content and its gonan be 4 months before ToS LFR fully opens - unless someone is hc/mythic raider there is 0 reason to play during this summer.<br />
<br />
its blizzard own fault that only decent content in game is for mythic raiders /shrug</div></div><hr />

pvp has died because classes have been pruned and simplified to the point that pvp turns into a pve dps race where you occasionally press instant cc buttons and check skada after each game to see how much dps you did vs how much the enemy team did - no wonder that less then 80k-100k players are actively participating in ranked pvp in EU or NA<br />
<br />
if the prestige system had been introduced in tbc/wotlk/cata or even mop, it would have been far far far far far far far more popular, because pvp was still fun in those expansions and so people were still actively participating in pvp in those expansions - same as ashran, decent system but wrong expansion with shitty 100% focused on raiding and spreadsheets class design (unique pvp trinkets only available through ashran rng aside, that would always have been hated no matter the expansion)</div></div><hr />

Me, because trying to get honor in random bgs as Alliance is a painful joke. I could spend several hours trying for one win, or do one WQ, which do you think I'm going to pick?</div></div><hr />

Also dont forgett some of ppl reaching prestige1 just reached it as a side effect of farming the tokens for the old gears (transmog) .</div></div><hr />

Maybe during Wrath there might have been more than 5m accounts in US and EU, Asia is never datamined/tracked for this.</div></div><hr />

My highest prestige is 3 and I am a fairly active pvper. But I also have 7 characters at 110 that I pvp with, none of which were able to take advantage of the boost in prestige 0-1 introduced in 7.2</div></div><hr />
