Blizzard is no longer reporting the number of World of Warcraft subscribers in their earnings calls, but there were a couple of interesting points in today's earnings call:<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion is expected to launch this summer, following the June release of the Warcraft film by Legendary Pictures. <br />
Blizzard Entertainment reached an all-time high for Monthly Active Users in 2015. Fourth quarter MAUs were up nearly 25% year-over-year, reflecting strong engagement with the online player community.<br />
On November 12, 2015, Blizzard launched The League of Explorers, the third adventure for Hearthstone, with 45 new cards. This Adventure sold over 20% more units as of the first 6 weeks after launch than the prior Adventure in the same time frame.<br />
Legacy of the Void sold over 1 million copies in the first 24 hours of launch.<br />

What can I say, I really liked the boost. Just came back to playing more WoW than just garrison for gold. I was Alliance and some friends moved to Horde and they needed a 4th for CM boosting. Used my boost on a hunter, got some PvP gear where needed and 1 week later I made enough gold to buy 1 year worth of tokens. It saved me ~150 euros so I'm fine with that :D</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it was pointless.<br />
<br />
Bad numbers = &quot;Wow is going to die&quot;<br />
Good numbers = &quot;Some excuse about how numbers will not last and will go down harder than before. &quot;<br />

No, I totally see the use of it, it's a great idea in fact. I wish we could opt out and get something else instead.</div></div><hr />

Monthly Active Users were up 25% across all their games. So if WoW subs are at nearly 6m right now, +25% would be an additional 1.5m<br />
<br />
So its safe to assume WoW subs are at 7.5 million as of right now.</div></div><hr />

That's not what &quot;across all games&quot; means. Not every game gained a 25% increase in users; their entire userbase grew 25%. Hearthstone likely accounts for the lion's share.</div></div><hr />

So its safe to assume WoW subs are at 7.5 million as of right now.How do you get 6million? Last report we got they were at 5.5 million. Also, its not just wow that is up by 25%. Its All online activity across all games, total, not individually. That is also compared to last year, not last quarter.<br />
<br />
I just hate that they wont report sub numbers anymore. Though I kind of see why since it seems their interest in wow being the staple is lessening. It just sucks, Less players hurts everyone who plays over all.</div></div><hr />

We'll never know for sure, but anecdotally, it just feels like more people are playing lately. I think 6.5-7.5 mil would be a safe bet.</div></div><hr />

The last time they reported sub numbers it was 5.8 million. So yeah, i rounded a little. We can probably expect subs to be at or around 7.5 million at this current point in time, given the metrics.</div></div><hr />

On average, all their games monthly active users went up by 25%. Do you not understand how statistics and averages work? I don't need to get into a math lesson right now do I?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see the correlation between not announcing sub numbers and there being less players because of it.<br />
<br />
I for one enjoy they aren't announcing the sub numbers anymore. It seems to have curbed a large amount of &quot;LOL OMG BLIZZ LOST SUBS LMAO DED GAME&quot; threads that we usually got around these reports each year. If anything it's lowering the toxicity on the forums a bit. Which is always good since it is hard to bring new players into a toxic environment, which unfortunately WoW has become over the past few years.<br />
<br />
I've actually had more friends leave WoW due to not wanting to deal with the toxic idiots moreso than anything they disliked about WoW.</div></div><hr />

I'd say you need an English lesson. It's not that each game went up 25% in active users, it's an overall additional 25% across all their games.</div></div><hr />

No. The last time the reported subs it was 5.5 Million. Not 5.8 http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151102007005/en/Activision-Blizzard-Announces-Agreement-Acquire-King-Digital. <br />
<br />
And no, we cannot expect subs to be at 7.5. You completely misinterpreted what they were saying and think that that means wow has an additional 25% subs. Being optimistic is that they are now at 6million, which I find hard to believe, since its harder to find a group to do anything like rated PvP or CMs now.<br />

<br />
I've actually had more friends leave WoW due to not wanting to deal with the toxic idiots moreso than anything they disliked about WoW.Honestly, I don't see the forums being the place they go to judge the community. They would more likely leave from toxic players in game then on the forums. They don't have to engage the players on the forums. If they are in a toxic group, they either have to leave or tolerate them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Duh.<br />
<br />
ON AVERAGE, monthly active users went up by 25%. What is wrong with you? So ON AVERAGE we can derrive that the WoW subs went up 25% or 1.5 million subs. So based ON AVERAGE the wow population is at or near 7.5 million active users.<br />
<br />
Now that could be completely wrong, and wow could have went down 10% in subs, and hearthstone could have gone up 40%, but that much across one game is highly unlikely. <br />
<br />
Also, I know this is &quot;anecdotal&quot; but the servers that I play on seem to have gone up in traffic and players. A lot more activity outside cities, in raids, etc. The group builder tool has many more raids looking for more people than ever before. Anecdotal? Yes, but still evidence nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

Average is the average of All online activity when they combine Each individual number, and then subtract by the number of platforms they combined. However, they are not averaging anything. They are saying the Monthly Active Users (MAU). Now, direct your attention to the line that reads: &quot;Record MAUs end of Q4, on continued strength across platforms and geographies&quot;<br />
<br />
They are not giving us an average. Over all, across all games on all platforms, the MAU is up 25%. Not on average.</div></div><hr />

Lol that is totally not what they said...<br />
<br />
TOTAL players from ALL BLIZZARD GAMES went up 25%. Not each game went up 25%. (Which would be an amazing statistical feat if they were to all receive the exact same player boost.)<br />
<br />
If WoW lost 2 million, and Hearthstone gain 2 million and there would be no net loss. Whatever WoW lost, their other games made up for it, and added +25%.</div></div><hr />

If you go by Wow Census, which has tracked subs pretty well, they're at about the same level as the last report, when they last gave out sub numbers. <br />
<br />
I thought/predicted they'd take a hit in January, but I was wrong. <br />
<br />
The real story is on Wall Street - Activision Blizzard stock is down because A-B had less profit than expected, and it's now rated at B, when they were A for months in 2015. It will probably recover, over time, but it's not the rocket ride it was last year.</div></div><hr />

HS is probably the biggest cash cow for Blizzard right now. I mean, WoW might still bring a bit more money, but Hearthstone probably has the highest income/development costs ratio. <br />
<br />
Just imagine... When it comes to HS, the development team is relatively small, the game is quite simple and doesn't require a lot of resources to create content for and probably sells really well, gaining a lot of profit as HS card packs aren't particularly cheap.</div></div><hr />

The bait is strong with this one. <br />
<br />
25% average over all games (common sense dicates hearthstone accounts for super big lion's share) results in 25% sub increase for WoW.<br />

ON AVERAGE, monthly active users went up by 25%. What is wrong with you? So ON AVERAGE we can derrive that the WoW subs went up 25% or 1.5 million subs. So based ON AVERAGE the wow population is at or near 7.5 million active users.<br />
<br />
Nowhere does it say it's an average though, it just says that monthly active users are up by 25%, and considering its outside the context of any particular game, I think it's safe to assume in this case &quot;user&quot; means a bnet account, so they could be playing any game. WoW subs could stay exactly the same and monthly active users could still go up by 25% if a lot of people were playing other bnet games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only 1 thing diffence tho. As a investor for those other games it amount revenue not sub numbers or active users because those other games are free. Wow on the other hand is important when it comes to numbers because it determine how much the game makes.<br />
<br />
Lets say you are invested in blizzard and they tell you they have 10 million account for hearthstone and 5 million subs for WoW. You would ask them how much total revenue did hearthstone make.... right? Because the bigger number isnt always the better number.</div></div><hr />

This is a significant number, given that the monetizing of existing players is likely at an all-time high... And the game is still losing money at an alarming rate. Using the 38% number bluntly (which is all wrong to do, but quick and dirty), the guess is that the game lost in the region of another two million subscribers; thus putting us around 3.5 million?<br />

<br />
Now that could be completely wrong, and wow could have went down 10% in subs, and hearthstone could have gone up 40%, but that much across one game is highly unlikely. <br />
<br />
Also, I know this is &quot;anecdotal&quot; but the servers that I play on seem to have gone up in traffic and players. A lot more activity outside cities, in raids, etc. The group builder tool has many more raids looking for more people than ever before. Anecdotal? Yes, but still evidence nonetheless.<br />
<br />
You still miss a point. If say, WoW had 5 millions active accounts. Diablo 3 had another 5, Heartstone had 12 millions (I think they pulled a number around those recently), then 2 millions in SC and say 5 millions in Heroes. That's a total (even if duplicated &quot;players&quot;) of 27 millions active users.<br />
<br />
all: 27x25% = 6.75 millions more active players across all games<br />
<br />
If WoW also has gained 25%, then it accounts for 1.25 millions of these new active players.<br />
If WoW lost say 10% (like you proposal), this only accounts for 500 000 active players lost. Heartstone clearly doesn't need to have a 40% increase, it would only mean, if redistributed ONLY to HS, having more than twice the active playebase, the increase would actually only require 30%, while diablo, starcraft and heroes increased 25%. A likely scenario, there was a new Diablo season recently, a new expansion for starcraft, and Heroes, I can only assume, keeps attracting more players with time.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to say that WoW definatly lost subs. But it could have and the global active players still got up 25% across all games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the bold scenario is way more likely than you are ready to admit.<br />
Also if you count in SC II activity (which released a new expansion in Q4) then yes, it gets more and more likely that wow was either stable or had minimal gains/losses with other games covering for it.<br />
<br />
Knowing past expansions sub cycles, it is HIGHLY unlikely that we will se any kind of spiking activity until the prepatch for legion gets into &quot;it's happening on date X&quot; range.</div></div><hr />

Chilton wasn't promoted on the back of a calamitous product; it looks as if Hazzikostas was. As for losing money, you know what I mean; that it's earning substantially less than it could be, had it been developed properly and not chased off half of its playerbase by designing for a minute percentage of players.</div></div><hr />

Even that analogy doesn't really do the case justice. If we are going to talk about the average growth/decline of a product's popularity or usage, you have to consider trends and past results. In WoW's case, the subscriber number trend is somewhere around &quot;falling like a burning meteor&quot; the last 18 months and influences such as new expansions and content that may change this are nowhere on the radar. Now based on past trends there likely WILL be a surge of re-subscribers closer to the release of Legion (whenever the hell that may be) but at the moment, there is absolutely nothing to suggest any increase of subscriber numbers at all this quarter.<br />
<br />
I'll be the first to say Blizzard are using vague terms and double-speak to make their show look good but it's an investor's report so what do you expect? Even with the data we do have at hand, for anyone to somehow draw a conclusion that WoW is somehow magically doing better with nothing but elementary school logic to back it up is both laughable and a little sad.</div></div><hr />

If the amount of money they were getting from that player was the same (unlikely), then they would be around 6.16 million players currently. However, a lot of people are buying tokens now for their sub, and they are actually a higher subrate in essence. So say that skewed the average up a few dollars to $30 a person. Then that would be around 5.47 million. Really there are a lot of factors to that though, and this is mostly a rough estimate, but it likely means things have stablized for the moment. Even if they are milking people a lot more and say earning $35 for the remaining players that would still be around 4.68 million. Again, this is mostly guesstimating, but I think it probably isn't that far off of reality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have dropped massive subs. My server 2yrs ago was always busy in trade/general chat. It was actually considered a &quot;high&quot; pop realm. Since WoD hit, it has become &quot;medium&quot; and outside of a 12pm-10pm server time window, trade chat is DEAD. <br />

If Legion doesn't bring players back, I really hope they ditch CRZ and just do server mergers...</div></div><hr />

Or maybe they just want idiot's ( Like you btw ) to stop use that same rehashed reason that &quot; The game is bad &quot; But lets say your right for a second...Lets says wow did drop down to 4 million players...What that? Oh yeah i remember now 2nd place don't even have close to that, even on accounts made. It must really piss off all the haters that even with them game at its lowest sub amount it still towers over the comp in sub amounts. GG.<br />
<br />
Yeah yeah lets keep on playing peter pan, Lets keep telling yourselfs the &quot; sub drop &quot; is because everyone hates the game for the very same reasons you do. Lets keep pertending Guild wars 2, FF14 and all the other company's that have tried to copy/paste wow has nothing to do with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They'll never do it. It's a sign of weakness (which will cause even more sub drops and lose investor confidence). The best you could hope for would be a &quot;mega-server&quot; system (basically CRZ but combining every server together until a limit is hit of a certain number of players in every zone). Dunno if Blizzard can pull that off though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GAAP WoW revenue is down to $164M from $266M between those quarters, a decline of 38%.<br />
<br />
The increase in deferred income for WoW for Q4 is $27M. This might be taken as a reflection of preorders for the expansion; the income for that would be deferred under GAAP accounting rules.<br />

You can't look at that because Q4 2014 included the expansion sales for WOW. If you want to compare to something than compare to the previous quarter where they actually go from 150 odd to 191. The weekly stats from CensusPlus also put the sub numbers around the same:<br />

Same reason they'll announce the increase in numbers once Legion actually launches.<br />
Good marketing tacts. <br />

Anyone who thinks there is a different reason why they stopped giving us WoW's numbers is clearly delusional. <br />

Sure, it gives players a better sense of overall health of the game community wise, but Blizzard doesn't care about that anymore. They've basically gone the Xbox One route with World of Warcraft. Rather than giving out raw sales (or sub) numbers, they give you fun little statistics like MAU (basically their equivalent of XBL stats). They're ashamed of the decline and it's gotten to the point that announcing a decline in subs every quarter is bad press. They had to stop.</div></div><hr />

But his point is still correct. You're comparing revenues between a quarter where they released an expansion in 2014 with a year later quarter where all they had was pre-purchases for Legion.<br />
<br />
The actual expansion purchases in the release quarter would dwarf any pre-purchases. Most people do not pre-purchase. And the difference between 2014 revenues and 2015 for WoW is about $100 million, or only about 2 million expansion purchases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly what it is. As far as I'm concerned, if they were even remotely close to 3 I'd be shocked. Something so small is a major indication on the health of the game. The fact that WoW lost almost half of their player base in 6 months was worrisome enough from an investor stand point, let alone how abysmal it probably currently is. You don't not report an incredibly easy to follow number if it is showing the game is healthy and doing good. You do hide it though if it's doing extremely poor. <br />
<br />
Looking at their Press release, they were down 15% from Q4 last year on their GAAP Net Revenues and 5% on their Non GAAP Revenue. That's for the entirety of Activision Blizzard though, not just Blizzard. Activision saw pretty decent growth in Call of Duty and one other franchise I can't remember off the top of my head right now which it was though, so the downfall doesn't seem to be on their end. Sure Blizzard saw growth, but in their pay to play games only, and they're only reporting log ins, not purchases or actual sales.<br />
<br />
My honest bet, WoW is probably down to near 1.5 million - 2 million tops range. The announcement pretty much glazed over WoW completely, let alone its current state. They may still be touting themselves as the number 1 MMO out there, but that could either be a lie or simply a very small margin at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't even make sense. If one game went up 50% and WoW went up 25% like they said then that would be 37.5% across the games. (50+25)/2=37.5%</div></div><hr />

I quit WoW last year after I completed BRF heroic. I started to play another MMORPG such as; Wildstar / FF14. I'm still catching up with my WoW friends by playing Hots / Diablo 3 though. Idk what's WoW current condition cus none of my homies subbed to WoW BUT from what I read in the official forum it's pretty much dead. Maybe people just taking a break / waiting for Legion to make a come back *shrugs* it's just sad to see that my fav and my first MMO is dying tbh.<br />

If another mmo comes out and says they have 1 million subs then they become the top mmo. And should be placed on this site as the mmo champion. With Blizzard not telling us, they could have 10 subscribers. They might as well have 0 since it doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />

Yet their annual revenue has hardly fallen off cause of all the extra money they're earning out of their existing base. The people left playing the game are more than making up for the 50% &quot;loss&quot; in subs. They can put less money into the game, just add new services and microtransactions, and still earn almost 1 billion in a year. As a metric it's not as important in how much money is being made overall, they don't care which revenue stream it comes from, whether it's subscriptions or mtx/services. The sub numbers appease players more than anything, which Blizzard doesn't care about during these earning calls. <br />
<br />
All this year has shown is they can lose 50% of their base, give us one content patch in 12 months, and hardly have a fall off in overall revenue. It's pretty depressing as a player, actually. Cause Blizzard looks at that and they know they have a certain set of people hooked and no matter what they do, these people left will throw money at them regardless of how poor the product is.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, I don't need any more 100s. I'd rather have a lower price, or have the difference credited to my account for future services or something.<br />

Also, how is a &quot;registered user&quot; defined in Hearthstone? If it means you ever played the game once, that's not a very revealing number. I mean I played it long enough to get the mount then uninstalled. Am I a registered user?</div></div><hr />

The game has literally no new content, no reason for people to return yet. The only thing WoW would have done is lost more subs. Main reason why they stopped reporting it. There isn't going to be any kind of jump in subs until Legion releases. The game is stagnant right now.</div></div><hr />

Played up to 2015 and stopped twice: Cataclysm and WoD. I now switched back to Diablo and 2.4 is so good that most of my earlier wow comrades either switched to Diablo or HS. Both games are sub free (HS is technically free is you farm) and get more content more often compared to WoW. WoW is also aging pretty bad graphically while the other 2 stay put.<br />
<br />
Simply put, WoW is no longer Blizz game nr 1. They just milk to fanbase til it's dead. And that's a pretty sad death for something that used to be so epic so long.</div></div><hr />

45.5% of Blizzards revenue in 2015 was from WoW. I seriously doubt that HS is making more considering how unlikely it is that their other games (D3, SC2, HoTS) made less than 10% considering both D3 and SC2 had expansions this year (D3 released in China and has microtransactions).</div></div><hr />

WoW has a lot fanboys.<br />
Many people continue to sub simply because they want to support the company.<br />
<br />
However, &quot;Blizzard wants to phase out WoW&quot; or &quot;WoW is replaced by Hearthstone&quot; will slowly kill the fanboys.<br />
Also these fanboys grow older, and no new fanboys come in.<br />

Nah its nonsense, you watch what happens if Legion is a success, suddenly it will be ok to reveal sub numbers again. <br />
<br />
They just dont want to have to write that there subs are down to 2 million or something. <br />

I dont see why not. Its still pretty much the most popular MMO out there, and with a 10 year pay to play model too, thats pretty impresive.<br />

<br />
That's true. That would put the drop off from $195 million down to $164 million. If we take a straight line the subs would have dropped to 4.6 million. It's a bit more complex than that because the subs don't necessarily match the revenue. People could sub only for the last month or cancel after 2. Looking at their history their max revenue per sub is $38.31 and their minimum is $22.60 so the range could be between 4.28 million and 5.9 million. Realistically though, the average over the last year hasn't dropped below $35 per user so the 4.6 million is probably fair.<br />
<br />
$164 million for a quarter for a 10 year old game is nothing to be scoffed at. I would guess that unless Legion is a smashing success, the model will change in the first quarter of next year to bring people back on board.</div></div><hr />

They'll stop reporting numbers for Hearthstone, Starcraft, and Overwatch once they go on a decline as well I'm sure. Why would companies decide to print out terrible information for consumers to digest? In reality even if WoW was at an all time low of say 2 million - that is way more than you would ever need to enjoy the game on most medium - high pop realms. It just looks bad because people think it'll go away or die off in relative time period, or something along those lines.<br />
<br />
But it's because people are attracted to bigger positive in numbers, growth in sales and player bases. It attracts casual individuals and even normal educated ones honestly -- it's just smart to do it.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is. Just because it's not doing as well as it used to doesn't mean it's not going strong. You're looking at it single-mindedly, you're forgetting the year is over a decade old. Nothing can grow forever, there's no exception for World of Warcraft, it's naturally going to lose its playerbase over time due to people just being bored of it. It's eventually going to have no servers due to nobody playing it, if you can't accept that you're looking at it unrealistically. <br />

The game is still doing great, it's STILL the top MMO in terms of active subscribers.</div></div><hr />

I could quibble on that because 2010 was higher, but yeah, looking over the annual numbers in Q4 investor reports, it's been pretty flat after that. From that I have to conclude they've lost disproportionately in low value markets like China. So it's not the case that &quot;all else is equal&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW had no rise whatsoever or at most a 100k rise, but most likely it's dropping. The active users are across all games, and considering that games like Starcraft got a new expansion I'd say their rise was by more than 25%. In fact, I'd go as far as say the people playing Starcraft made up for the fall in WoW users when counting active users across all games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We saw an immense drop from 10mil to 5.5 mil within two quartals. While it is common to decelerate (in this case it'd be unable to keep up that loss, or there wouldn't be any players left by now) after a while, I'd rather expect numbers to have gone 5.5 =&gt; 4 =&gt; 5.5 and we're roughly at where we were at the last announcement.<br />
<br />
It's really just a gut feeling, but If you think about it; why would WoW see rising sucscription numbers after the first 2 quarters when at that time we found out we'd be stuck with the new content for an entire year? That's why I expect numbers dropping further after that, with some people returning with the legion hype.<br />
<br />
Dont forget WoW tokens, which likely are included in subscription numbers. If one buys tokens from ingame gold and saves the sub fee, can you really consider him in a count with actively paying customers?<br />
<br />
Blizz did increase their playerbase overall. That's why they post their results.<br />
Blizz did have huge amounts of wow players in the past. That's why they posted their results.<br />
Blizz stopped having huge amounts of wow players. They lost a lot of subs. They stopped showing results.<br />
It's easy, really. If you as a new potential player got a look of their dropping sub numbers, you'd think: Okaaayyy, looks like the game's time is over, going for something else instead.<br />
It's bad advertising. You only show the good of a product, not the bad.<br />
<br />
Now ask yourself: Even with them saying they wont show wow sub numbers anymore, do you really think blizz would stick to not showing them if they managed to raise them back up again?<br />
It'd be good advertising, wouldn't it? &quot;Look, we've hit a rough spot, but we pulled it up again WITH EFFORT! The game's great again, all of you, come back and see for yourself!&quot;.<br />
The reason why they can say they wont post their numbers anymore is simple (NO EFFORT!): <br />
-They know perfectly well that there is nothing in WoD with even remotely the power to lift sub numbers. <br />
-They haven't planned anything for the entire year<br />
-They botched lore with a half-assed alternative time line theme, garrosh/ner'zhul/kargath dieing derpy deaths considering the hipe-videos showing their lore, Grommash suddenly being the good guy in a more than stupid ~plot twist~, changing from the one big villain that they had carry the x-pack turn into a random npc, not mentioning their derpy reason for the invasion in the first place.<br />
-They more or less ignored pvp content<br />
-They gave us a boring garisson instead of epic Karabor/Bladespire Citadel<br />
-They made follower missions a boring mainte-annoyance and, evaluating it's non-immersive &quot;success&quot;, decided to copy-paste it for the shipyard (where you can insta-pop ships, but not decide what kind of crew you want on it :rolleyes: (after being able to choose the race of your garisson guards :rolleyes:).<br />
-Apexis crystals...<br />
-Half assed reputations...<br />
<br />
A big part of the game for me atm is doing old content tbh. I haven't raided much for a while, and haven't done much pvp at all this x-pack.<br />
<br />
Guess why.</div></div><hr />

Hi,<br />
<br />
Tokens are not included in Subscription numbers. That is most likely the driver for no longer reporting subscription counts; ergo, Subscription numbers are an outdated metric when you have Tokens. Investors, market researchers and (I would assume) anyone looking at this objectively would feel no problem with the decision to not publish Subscription numbers because Tokens = higher Revenue than traditional subscription cost.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard have dealt a huge blow to the biggest Bot (no need to name names) whilst providing in game gold to its player base. All good business.<br />

Subscription numbers are an outdated metric, and Blizzard are in better control of the in game economy than ever; Blizzard are in a strong position right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that they DO count as subs. Here's your proof; https://twitter.com/blizzardwatch/status/596056727574827008<br />
<br />
They didn't count in Q1 because they literally released at the end of Q1. They counted from Q2, when they were active subs, onward. They are 100% active subs that count as active subs.<br />
<br />
The single, only drive for not reporting sub numbers is they were an easy metric for the health of the game, and they were plummeting. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has completely shifted their focus to their stock holders now though, and the sub number losses don't mean shit to them as long as Blizzard keeps churning out profits. Even in that instance though, they're just not holding a candle to where they were last year, having seen Q4 results almost 15% lower than last years Q4. Overall, Activision Blizzard saw some increase in GAAP income, but also a loss in Non-GAAP income.<br />
<br />
The WoW of old is dead and gone, and now even the WoW of today is on it's way out. I sincerely believe that Blizzard should start to shift their focus away from WoW and hopefully, finally, let the aging beast die a proper death. On the other hand, I don't see them actually doing that, instead going to milk it for every last drop it has to offer.</div></div><hr />

After 11 years WoW is still the most renown and probably most played MMO around, even with only having half the subscribers it had at WoD launch.<br />
And for the large majority there isn't another MMO that tends to tick the checkboxes that this game does.<br />
<br />
WoW isnt most played mmo. It is biggest sub based MMO but there are far bigger mmos with far bigger playerbases.</div></div><hr />

I have not a single doubt that blizz are in a strong position right now.<br />
I also have not a single doubt that this is now entirely buisness for them, no passion left, just milking cash primarily, disregarding quality ( you know, the one thing they wrote big on their 25y anniversary report headline? ). <br />
As far as WoW goes, blizz used to be high on quality. Well, they have stopped on that long ago. The sharp moment that stopped was wotlk -&gt; cata. The lore prepared for us was leftovers from WCIII up to that point, and then they stopped preparing us properly of what's to come, why stuff is happening as it does etc etc. They cleverly bought themselves time with the ending of WCII frozen throne by putting arthas into cryo sleep, but rushed to the big confrontation within the second x-pack. After that, half assed lore. <br />
Deathwing was a known name before cata, but mainly by WCII players. We at least had Onyxia/Nefarian as previous bosses to involve us a little more with relating to DW. Still, it was a drop. Also, the start of ingame shop.<br />
MoP had amazing lore in itself, but was disconnected from the rest of the world, made up on the spot, and started in it's entirety from the decision to capitalize from an april's fool. Also, the start of lfr to trivialize raid progress more in favor of casuals.<br />
Nothing what's worth having is easy to get. Ingame mounts count to that as well as free loot.<br />
WoD decended even more in that drop. They basically hyped everyone up with videos and outland nostalgia, and then dropped all those hopes and expectations with a severe lack of giving a fuck. Cash in on all the sold copies of the x-pack and the first months of high subscriptions, that's it. Introduce more cash dumps when numbers drop to compensate. The blight of this era: Wow tokens.<br />
<br />
Oh, I dont doubt for a second that blizz will continue to rake in the profit, on our cost as well as on the game qualities'.<br />
<br />
They should just make the game f2p.<br />
I wont complain about an x-pack that costs me once, and lasts a couple of months. It is a better investment than buying a shooter and be done after a couple of days, after finishing it.<br />
But I do mind paying sub fees for continued effort on blizz's part which just doesn't happen after the release.<br />
<br />
Dropping sub fees would no doubt bring a lot of people to the game. It would raise up the quality of the game, as a mmorpg without the &quot;masses&quot; is just an morpg, and not what people came for. <br />
Look at hearthstone if you doubt the power of f2p.<br />
Do you think it'd have 40m players if it weren't f2p? There's bound to be lots of people spending money on cards, but none actually has to. If it turned sub fee, I dont doubt a 75%+ loss of playerbase.</div></div><hr />

That's no longer the case and they want to prevent this from happening again. Everyone knows WoW will die, the question is just when.<br />

<br /> 
25% average over all games (common sense dicates hearthstone accounts for super big lion's share) results in 25% sub increase for WoW.<br />
flawless logic<br />
<br />
It's not an average, but if it were, it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that WoW got a 25% increase in subscribers.<br />
<br />
If EVERY game had an increase of 25% MAU, then the average would be 25%. But it's not an average, it's all of the playerbase changes added up.<br />
<br />
So if WoW got a 5% increase, HS got a 10%, and Diablo, Starcraft, and Heroes got a total of a 10% inrease, that would mean a 25% increase across all games.<br />

And, take note of a very telling comment in there:<br />
<br />
&quot;King can also bring expertise that can help Activision Blizzard increase digital revenue going forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Digital revenue = cash shops. Does that mean WoW? We'll see. <br />
<br />
We'll see if Blizzard can keep that moose's nose out of their door. So far, I believe Blizzard has been able to keep independent of Kotick's schemes, but I can't help think there will be some forced &quot;synergy&quot; with the eSport and King acquisitions.</div></div><hr />

Do you not understand how statistics and averages work? I don't need to get into a math lesson right now do I?<br />
<br />
first, thats not what they said, second, its not how it works anyway. if they had 40M players before and now have 50M and HS alone went up by 10M and everything else remained about the same, they still average 25% increase across all games, while not reporting stale number from all their other games, not a rocket science</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shakari</div><div class="date">2016-02-12, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Duh.<br />
<br />
ON AVERAGE, monthly active users went up by 25%. What is wrong with you? So ON AVERAGE we can derrive that the WoW subs went up 25% or 1.5 million subs. So based ON AVERAGE the wow population is at or near 7.5 million active users.<br />
<br />
Now that could be completely wrong, and wow could have went down 10% in subs, and hearthstone could have gone up 40%, but that much across one game is highly unlikely. <br />
<br />
Also, I know this is &quot;anecdotal&quot; but the servers that I play on seem to have gone up in traffic and players. A lot more activity outside cities, in raids, etc. The group builder tool has many more raids looking for more people than ever before. Anecdotal? Yes, but still evidence nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Simply hoping that WoW had an increase is optimistic, blindly stating users play wow went up by 25% is really a bit silly. Its about as likley as your example of hearthstone going up 40%.<br />
<br />
You simply cannot derive an average increase for one game out of 4 when your only told the increase combined for all 4 games and thats its.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumaras</div><div class="date">2016-02-12, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The ironic thing is that if you check here 95% of the comments are related to the effect of wow on Blizz's financials, but if you read any Wall Street articles today none of them I see even mentioned wow. From a financial perspective, wow is a far smaller piece of the pie for Activision-Blizzard than gamers realize. In fact what the financial articles are about today are Cod and Destiny 2 coming, and the disappointing sales of Skylanders and Guitar Hero. Wow wasn't even mentioned. Their stock is down about 10% today mainly on overall earnings missing estimates for the first time in over 6 years, and lower future projections of revenue. But people thinking wow is still the majority of Blizzard are missing the boat, because Wall Street has moved on and already considers it a dead/dying IP. In fact that's been the case from them for a few quarters now. Wall Street is more interested in the Activision products, the King acquisition, and from the Blizz side things like Hearthstone expansions, Overwatch, and whatever comes next outside of wow with the hope of striking (revenue) gold again like they did with wow. Gamers are the only ones still focused on wow as the primary Activision-Blizzard IP. <br />
<br />
Not saying it's right or wrong, but good info to keep in mind since Wall Street usually knows their stuff. Plus if you only go off what you read here I think many would miss that perspective that wow is a smaller piece of them now than they seem to think. Blizzard's situation with wow and even Activision has changed dramatically (and really totally reversed) from a financial end from 5-6 years ago, but people still have that old mindset. Back then for a while wow carried Activision and Blizzard, but now Activision is bigger than Blizzard and wow is even just a relatively small portion of Blizzard by itself. I'd be surprised if wow is even 10% of Activision-Blizzard overall revenue now.</div></div><hr />

Tokens are not included in Subscription numbers. That is most likely the driver for no longer reporting subscription counts; ergo, Subscription numbers are an outdated metric when you have Tokens. Investors, market researchers and (I would assume) anyone looking at this objectively would feel no problem with the decision to not publish Subscription numbers because Tokens = higher Revenue than traditional subscription cost.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard have dealt a huge blow to the biggest Bot (no need to name names) whilst providing in game gold to its player base. All good business.<br />
<br />
Subscription numbers are an outdated metric, and Blizzard are in better control of the in game economy than ever; Blizzard are in a strong position right now.<br />
<br />
When you are using Tokens, you count as having an Active sub, Blizzard has had Prepaid cards for years, Tokens act the same way, but cost more. <br />
<br />
By not posting WOW's numbers they are basically admitting the Numbers have reached a low point where it isn't worth posting them any more. There are die hard fans who will continue to pay for subs, and there are people too lazy to move on. I can see WOW holding somewhere around 3-4 million subs for 5-10 more years with peeks when they release new content. <br />
<br />
At the same time 40million people are actively playing Hearthstone, and people are very active in the other new IPs. Blizzard is making more money now than ever, even WOW which is no where near as popular is still highly profitable, and is secure as the most played MMORPG for a long time to come. <br />
<br />
I see this as just the overall Demographic has changed, RPG fans were never why WOW took off, and many of the people and type of people who made WOW hit 12million + active Subs long ago, are still playing Blizzard Games. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile the True D&amp;D gamer nerds are still into WOW, and a couple of Asian MMOs, as such WOW is still doing very well. <br />
<br />
-As I have said for years, &quot;There is no WOW killer besides Blizzard&quot;</div></div><hr />

Our esports initiatives, enhanced by our recent acquisition of Major League Gaming, allow us to reward our players around the world for their dedication and investment in our games. We expect to generate approximately $6.25 billion in revenues and over $2.0 billion of operating income in 2016 and we will have over 9,000 of the most talented people making, marketing and selling great games around the world.”&quot;<br />
<br />
It's a really good merger/acquisition. Not a lot of overlap.<br />
<br />
On a slightly different note, what's the bet we see a change in the payments for WOW some time in the future. Micro-transactions are really lucrative.</div></div><hr />

Missing Highmaul from the opening of WoD, and if you're going to include non-raid content patches for other expansions, TJ should be included as well.<br />

Not sure if it was mentioned yet, but the stock yesterday climbed nicely and then saw a pretty big sell-off right around the time of the call. Other companies outside the video game industry have had this happen as well recently (Ford, for example), despite positive overall news. People are quite skittish these days.<br />
<br />
I was following the timeline on the Wiki, yah I know not as good as just following patches content, but I wasn't trying to include everything. I was following the outline by the other person as well. Although missing Highmaul, my bad it wasn't listed as a raid in the WoD release. And frankly I forgot about it.</div></div><hr />

I blame it on Hearthstone.<br />
<br />
Blizzard thought Hearthstone can replace WoW with less employees/contents.<br />
<br />
For people who don't know, Hearthstone is in trouble.<br />
Impossible to balance, because Blizzard releases cards every 3 to 4 months.<br />
It is good to know that Blizzard works really hard on other games, just not WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And, I have no idea how, but this is indicating that there is just as much in-game activity now as there was a year ago. That's pretty impressive considering how they've managed the content release this time around. Most of the people I played with gave over in the summer and I didn't renew mine either - I would like to know which demographic enjoys the current state of the game so much.<br />
<br />
The last subscriber figures were still following the long term trend for WoW: http://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/. <br />
<br />
So that's almost a 20% drop so far for WoD, compared with a 25% for MoP - so it's done pretty well. We'll never know what subs were this quarter but based on previous expansions subs should start rising again in spring ahead of Legion. So WoD has done better that MoP subs-wise over the cycle and also had the most successful launch (in terms of subs add) in WoW history. Now they didn't stick around but that didn't affect the long term trend.</div></div><hr />

Orcs in the first war were cruel, bloodthirsty mofos who didn't take prisoners. Instead they'd put heads on spikes, mutilated corpses, licked blood, raised corpses as undead and what not. Legion influence at it's finest. From the trailers, blizz complete craps on their noble first great work lore-wise with all that durotan buisness, a future for both races and what not. In original lore, Wrynn was killed in cold blood, the city sacked and the few survivors fled over the seas to escape the insane slaughter mob. Not seeing any of that in the trailer.<br />
If they intend to cash in from player pockets with that one, they might have a bad surprise as far as lore fans goes.<br />
<br />
I am considering legion though. Class development was dearly needed, so if just for that, it's a big incentive. Dunno yet about content, but so far it's looking good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
40+ million registered users. Cut w/e you want from that to some 20-30 mil semi-active players. Now think about the fact that only based on the microtransactions factor, blizzard makes a MEGA FUCTON of money JUST from card packs sales. Their margins are already through the roof to absurd level (candy crush games would be a similar comparison in profit margins and scale), now you already make insane margins which fill your investors's pockets with tons of money.<br />
You now have to look at least 3 expansions per year. 3 expansion which following the recent model would amount to at least one adventure and two bigger expansions that introduce a lot more cards with their own new card pack also in the shop. You have around 20$ + for that adventure and new &quot;mandatory for competitiveness&quot; cards and card packs fueled into the game every year. All that fueled into a 20-30 mil active player base. And if you played hearthstone at least for a decent period you would understand that MOST of all the active/pseudo-active players would spend money one way or another for any specific crap from those expansions.<br />
Hearthstone is doing great. Its the most successful product blizzard pulled out in ages and with a model that will only grow and make more money.<br />
The only thing I'm surprised is the fact they choose to not state publicly how much they make with every specific franchise.<br />
Another reason why they are not doing bad is a personal example:<br />
I'm not a big fan of hearthstone (good enough when your on your shitter), but just looking at the last blizzcon panels... It felt like a lightyear difference in passion and interest for the product compared to wow or other aspects. And you can feel it in the game itself their last expansion is a blast, you can see and feel that the designers really had some fun and created something out of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So its safe to assume WoW subs are at 7.5 million as of right now.<br />
<br />
Wrong, it states &quot;Blizzard reached an all-time high for Monthly Active Users in 2015. Fourth quarter MAUs were up nearly 25% year-over-year.&quot;<br />
It says Blizzard, not WoW's Monthly Active Users...therefore, a potential scenario is that WoW's lost more subscribers, and they're using the new gains from Hearthstone to account for this...seeing as how they also mentioned that Hearthstone has reached 40 million registered users.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I am one of the 40 million registered user but I haven't touched the game after the first 10 minutes I tried it when it launched.<br />

Yup. Unfortunately every gaming company does this. It's about spinning your numbers to make it sound better than what you're really doing, even when you might not even be doing terrible in the first place. It's annoying but unfortunately it's the way these companies work. -shrug-</div></div><hr />

I stopped playing after I got the achievement for the Pegasus mount in WoW. Well, at least this game had held my interest that long. In HotS I did not get through the intro. I hate this point and click movement concept. Together with the enormous loot randomness, this also finally killed Diablo III for me, and I have been quite an addict for DI and DII. I don't know if I will ever get the Graves pet...<br />
<br />
Anyway, I spend a great chunk of my time in WoW in older content - leveling alts, farming mounts and transmogs. So far, the sub is justified for me. But it seems that I will not touch any other Blizzard game again. I would love an Overwatch anime series instead of a game, BTW.</div></div><hr />

Oh, but even when they reported subs, people speculated and just flat out claimed they lied. And when sub numbers were high people claimed that popularity does not equal qulaity, so..yeah...screw all that.<br />

I am sure they will report box sales of Legion and if they are anything like WoD (10 million) then the speculation fires will just burn again. Hell..they will burn anyhow</div></div><hr />

Two things to note:<br />
<br />
1. The segmented breakdown shows Blizzard to be a drag on previous year earnings.<br />
<br />
2. Both the Outlook and Highlights sections mention WoW almost in passing.<br />

Combine the two, and you can deduce that Blizzard's performance is only being bolstered by new IP/product, definitely not by WoW.</div></div><hr />

It's exactly how it works. If their competition had anything to brag about I suppose they would have as well. It's very telling that they don't and never really have. Even Final Fantasy XIV, which is a very fine MMO, relies on accounts created. I'm just saying that instead of bleating about Blizzard the fair thing would have been to hold everyone to the same standard.</div></div><hr />

Because they were never arrogant enough to do it. We demand numbers because we were always given them. Nobody demands the same from others cause they never did. They're just embarrassed now and know the game is dying. They forecast it never going above 5.5 again. There have been rumors they're not happy with Legion preorder numbers as well. I don't think they'll be seeing that huge bump like they did in WoD and past expansions.</div></div><hr />

Well we can see they are desperate, its so obvious. Just imagine years ago saying they would handle free artifacts for buying an expansion, a guy would be lynched by a mob by just saying that out loud. In fact I am quite surprised there are people still playing. I quit soon after wrath, tried a lil bit of cataclysm but the ammount of lorelols and retcons drove me out. I did play mists of pandamon for 1 month more or less, chasing rare mobs for unique items was fun but the whole pokemon + kung fu panda theme was too much for it. Didn't even bother with draenor and looks like I wont with this one.</div></div><hr />
