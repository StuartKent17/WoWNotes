<br />
We're still unsure on how this gear will be deployed when Wrath of the Lich King hits the live servers, it looks like a lot of gear is already ready on the PvP side and it might takes time before we see items this powerful activated on live servers. Obviously this post will be updated if anything new is discovered. <br />

Upcoming Change: Blizzard Event/Collector's Edition items<br />
Tigole just made a post about an interesting change, in an upcoming build a few items will be bound to account. I'm sure some of these little things will see their price going very high ... in some places. <br />
The following items will be changed to &quot;Account Bound &quot; items:<br />
<br />
Murky (Blue Murloc Egg)<br />
Tyriel's Hilt<br />
Murloc Costume<br />
All of the collector's edition pets<br />
<br />
Also, for the &quot;pet&quot; items, we're making it so that adding the pet to your collection will not remove the item from your inventory. With that change, you'll be able to learn Murky on any character on the same realm with the character that currently has Murky. It also means that if you own the original Collector's Edition, you'll be able to have all 3 pets (Zerg, Diablo, Panda) by mailing the items between characters. If this works out well in the Beta and people like the change, we'll keep it in. One minor note to current Beta players: If you already &quot;consumed&quot; your item by adding a pet to your collection, you will not be able to get it back. This is a &quot;beta only&quot; side-effect that would not exist in the actual game.</div></div><hr />

half a year, try 2, but it's not like making those gear's hard, all it is is stats padding</div></div><hr />

wut? u really think those 239 and 252 epics will be available immediately? they look, if anything, like a second WotLK season, and we have still 2 months till release, when s5 will start, then atleast 4 months till next major patch with new arena sounds about right to me.<br />
<br />
u have better explanation? like those epics will be there from start, without needed rating, so everyone can gear out in +50ilev gear for raiding vs naxx items? :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it works like live, except it's account bound as well. Then I don't think there's an issue with this change.<br />
<br />
Seems quite foolish that they've wasted time itemising the arena gear from seasons away, especially as they don't really know how classes are going to shape up.</div></div><hr />

classes aren't balanced with gear, they're balanced with spells and talents</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you ask me, they should make ALL mounts and ALL non-combat pets &quot;Account Bound&quot;. So that ALL the characters you have (on a specific realm), can enjoy them.<br />
<br />
For example, if you have a Netherdrake on your main character, it really sucks to go and farm it for your alt.<br />
Especially if you choose to make that alt your new &quot;main&quot; character. <br />
And I am pretty sure there are many(!) ppl around with all sorts of mounts and non-combat pets that want to roll a new character for WotLK and are frustrated in the thought that they will lose all their mounts and non-combat pets.</div></div><hr />

Where to stop then? Account wide reputation? Account wide tier sets? I also don't like the idea of buying a new bank slot for my vanity pets :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
S5 for arena points or will they do S5 for honor and S6 for arena points?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mayhem</div><div class="date">2008-09-18, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">right, giveaway season5 items, dont think so, guess we will start in blue pvpgear and work our way through to s5<br />
<br />
i dont like the idea of account bound items, i made one of my alts to my main after i achieved the netherdrake mount and rep at allmost every needed faction, well you have to sacrafice something, if not we soon have 8 lvl 80 chars well geared, well rept and ppl just charjumping, hum bye bye rpg-feeling</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You won't need a bank slot since we get a pets tab in 3.0 patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I wonder how fast that brutal netherdrake mount flys, it says extremely fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
idk if you have read the blue post this thread is all about but blizzard is &quot;making it so that adding the pet to your collection will not remove the item from your inventory&quot;. so most peope will save their pets for future twinks i guess, at least that's what im going to do.</div></div><hr />
