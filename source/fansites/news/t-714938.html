Those look absolutely nothing like the shapeless ones, soooo unless it's a placeholder... no.<br />
<br />
Or it could be a &quot;trap&quot; of sorts, and they shapeshift in combat. That'd also be pretty awesome.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, these guys look a lot more like the faceless ones then like the shapeless ones from the concept art.<br />

Maybe they aren't even related to the old gods, maybe they are just the same model as the faceless ones but redone into a new underwater design. It's a little difficult to make out the minor details on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a lot of confusion about this and it's been going on for years. Neptulon is not an Old God, he is a LIEUTENANT of the Old Gods, just like all the other elemental lords (Ragnaros, Al'Akir and Therazane), who worked FOR the Old Gods during the time the titans first arrived on Azeroth and who are probably STILL working for them.</div></div><hr />

Yes there is a Old God in the Maelstrom<br />
Yes these are his minion<br />
No they are not the real model. These are place holders, unless blizz wants to be lame and say &quot;Yogg sarons reach was so vast that it went into the maelstrom!&quot;. The model will be subject to much change and probable alterations in shape and character.<br />

I think they're either:<br />

A. Just mobs of Neptulon with the same model<br />

OR<br />
<br />
B. Actual Faceless Ones<br />
<br />
Neptulon is a servant of the Old Gods, so it'd seriously make sense, and also in Stormrage it's been announced there's an Old God somewhere in the Ocean..so it'd make sense.</div></div><hr />

More Faceless ones=awesome<br />
If you haven't read the comic yet, c'thun awakens a huge faceless one from its slumber in the ocean, to attack the theramore island. So dont jump to conclusions that these belong to another old God.</div></div><hr />

It makes sense that Old God minions would look similar, and it`s happend before. Don`t believe me; check out the Twin Emperors of AQ40 and compare them to Faceless Ones and consider how similar they are despite the fact they are the twisted form of a different race. Another slightly more abstract example are AQ40s Three Bugs and the critter and Master`s Glaive.<br />
<br />
Also look under the left ones fist, looks like a unique model boss based on Faceless Ones.</div></div><hr />

Yes there is a Old God in the Maelstrom<br />
Yes these are his minion<br />
No they are not the real model. These are place holders, unless blizz wants to be lame and say &quot;Yogg sarons reach was so vast that it went into the maelstrom!&quot;. The model will be subject to much change and probable alterations in shape and character.<br />
<br />
Of cource i could be wrong ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
i was going to say with the presence of those &quot; faceless ones&quot; most likley not going to be the same mobs later o, but since it means a presence of an old god it could be that its the same one that turned a bunch of the Highborne into Naga, probly thats what happened to a bunch of these goblins as well</div></div><hr />

Those are NOT placeholders people, look at the new textures and color details spanning the entire model.<br />
They're faceless zealots of neptulon. And what's more, they seem to have a much more aquatic feel and resemble luminescent squids even more than their predecessors. These, these are the Bouncers of the Old Gods.</div></div><hr />

First off, the Old Gods' minions do not discriminate between their leaders and vice versa. The Twilight cultists themselves serve the Old Gods' agenda, not just one of them. They may be positioned and stationed in different areas, as is the case with these enhanced aquatic models(Likely set aside for neptulon), but they serve the whole. The Old Gods have no intent of turning on each other and their resources are shared accordingly. After all, they did each hold a seat of power and a citadel before the titans arrived. <br />
<br />
Besides, this is the Abbysal Maw and not home to an Old God, but one of their lieutenants. The shapeless still have a part to play.</div></div><hr />

Why were there no Quiraji near Yogg?<br />
Im sure neptulon is in the abbysal maw, but he would have nothing to do with the Faceless. Rag had nothing to do with any old god things except for possibly naga, but thats likely the luitenant creation.<br />
The Shapless would be in the Deathwing scar or Grim Batol no doubt</div></div><hr />

C'thun created the Qiraji from the silithid. Either they are slaves or willing servents, but they are none the less his. Nerubians are also part of the race, they traveled north before the sundering. And why wouldnt neptulon have any thing to do with them? Their the servents of the Old gods and so far he has been loyal to the Old Gods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The nerubian are a branch-off of the Azquir, not Quiraji. The elemental luitenants are all pissed off at each other, though the old gods are all cool with each other. Ragnaros would have used some sort of Old God minion according to your theory, but he didnt, so why would neptulon use any? I would agree that the Old God would use the faceless mold for their minions, but C'thun merged the Azquir with the mold, creating the Quiraji.</div></div><hr />

Nerubians and Qiraji are evolved from the Aqir, hence when I said part of the same race.<br />
Element problem you have,<br />
1. two children fight, ones the good son the other the bad son. Can i make a better example? <br />
2. What happens in vanilla stays in vanilla. It seems like nowadays ragnaros is more of a team player wouldn't you say?<br />
3. Being so early in development, theres lack of models for all these different races and minions and bosses and a lack of lore, until now.<br />
4. Again, vanilla=most likely didnt happen, their trying their best to come up with a &quot;well that wasn't his head&quot; story for so many ppl. Read the gnomer/echo story? we brought back rocks and machine parts.<br />
5. if you cant believe any of that, Ragnaros=hot Faceless ones=please dont put us in that volcano <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thing i wanna point out is you said those faceless ones are stand in cause faceless ones belong to yogg.....Did you read the comic? C'thun awakens a faceless one whose out at sea near theramore. Heres somthing for you to think about, so far all god like beings have been shown to create races in their image, is it hard to believe that Old gods created these faceless ones the same way?(excluding demons who just convert others to their demon club)</div></div><hr />

This^.<br />
<br />
Vanilla was World of Warcraft's rough draft where lore is concered. The emergence of Old Gods is a result of their sucessful inclusion in AQ. The silithid were a much less moldable race im sure and therefore are not as dispensable and a surely limited supply of troops, selected and bred by c'thun only, because he was in closest proximity to them. It was Blizzard's decision not to use them again(Except in BC again in The Arcatraz, very interesting story behind that) more than likely because their theme did not quite meet the criteria of the expansions.</div></div><hr />

Nice images! The graphics look amazing, and I love how they updated those darn crocodiles! They were hideous! <br />
<br />
And for the people fighting over the faceless ones or not, they look similar in shape but that's a completely new head and it has eyes. Can't be faceless when you got eyes!</div></div><hr />

I agree, enough of the stretched out textures that havent aged well, the art style is nice but its 2010, can we please get a serious graphics update, seriously.</div></div><hr />

i would've guessed flameweave, but admit it i was close ::)<br />
<br />
new zones are looking fantastic, but places like tol barad are clearly not done yet, we have many months ahead, but i look forward to ruby sanctum in the short-term.</div></div><hr />

Turns out this took me ages, so if anyone else wants to download them all I've uploaded them to rapidshare for you to download. It's a pretty big .rar but every one is 1680x1050 resolution. Credit to boub of course for taking them all!<br />
