<br />
If it drains for 1000, assuming you have full pvp gear, you'll still get drained 800 mana.<br />
<br />
That's quite a lot. But it's better than the current state at least.<br />

<br />
<br />
But the s2 gears will also become BG gears next season though, which is pretty much on even with stormheralds if ignoring the stun proc differences.<br />
<br />
I guess that's the reason why they downgraded the requirement for vortex.</div></div><hr />

Its still 100% if you have a pally using Imp Conc aura, although its not like shamans need any nerfs to their capacity to function without them in 2's and 3's.</div></div><hr />

Wlock: 200 x5 sec channeled<br />
<br />
The hunter being instant, i would still argue is better than a channeled spell.<br />
<br />
The change just brings the 3 diffrent manadrains closer in perfomance.<br />

Sure in the worst case scenario now the wlock is better off, if the person being drained is in LOS the whole duration. In most cases it evens out alot more tbh.</div></div><hr />

Well I would accept this, but you cant los mana drain the instant they cast the spell.<br />

Right was thinking it was same as arcane misiles, where the los check happens at each tick.<br />
<br />
Personally hate pvp, but los check on all types would only seem fair, personally would only use the spell on stuff like the stuff in aq, which that wouldnt really effect.<br />
<br />
That said, since its channeled you loose alot of &quot;casting/channeled time&quot; if your getting hit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc36bcfd4388</div><div class="date">2008-02-15, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We all DO know, that blizzard likes the locks...<br />
Usually i wouldn't flame over such things, but buffing the locks with Manadrain by 50% is just ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Hunter: 4x 462 manapoints over 8 seconds with 15 seconds cooldown<br />
=&gt; Meaning about 1700 mana drained every 15 seconds<br />
=&gt; As in arena, it is most likely to be disspelled (pretty often) cuz we only have the scorpid with us!<br />
<br />
Priest: No Cooldown and drains something about 800-1000(?) mana over 1.5 seconds (skilled)<br />
=&gt; Going at the manadrain by duration 15seconds would be like 8k mana<br />
=&gt; This is possible, however priest is HIGHLY affected and contered with LOS<br />
<br />
Warlock: 5x 300 manapoints over 5 seconds with no cooldown at all<br />
=&gt; 15 seconds would be 15x 300 meaning 4500 Mana drained over 15 seconds<br />
=&gt; It can be countered with disspell (though the lock has more magic on the enemy than this one) and range, as well as silence and interrupt effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking at all this, i'd say Hunter still is the most powerful Mandrain in SOME way. However the lock has more potential with his crowd control (FEAR) which makes HIS Manadrain so much more better than any other one, this isn't funny anymore.<br />
<br />
Locks manadrain already was pretty good, it did not require any buff at all. Lock/Druid for example are so fucking strong because they got fucking awesom CC in both parts, a really great manadrain on one part and ofcourse the healer on the other hand....<br />
With this buff (though combined with the manadrain/resilence-nerf) every warlock/druid team receives such a fucking enormous buff, it's just not believable.<br />
<br />
Getting a Druid OOM already was pretty hard. Now with Locks buff and Druids Resi, it will last 10 more minutes to win....<br />
<br />
<br />
Gratz looking into changes - just remove the damn 2on2 ....<br />

=&gt; 15 seconds would be 15x 300 meaning 4500 Mana drained over 15 seconds<br />
=&gt; It can be countered with disspell (though the lock has more magic on the enemy than this one) and range, as well as silence and interrupt effects.<br />

There's no way at all to conquer HIS way of playing, if he really, really wants it...<br />
I got Silence, Scatter, Trap and BE-Silence - after that, hes like 15 seconds free, what he wants to do - i got one more silence for him, but this doesn't change the fact, that hes able to start draining once the effect ends...<br />
I - as the hunter i am - NEED to wait 15 seconds, even if it get's disspelled 0.1seconds after i applied it.....<br />
<br />
Trust me, i know PvP pretty well, but this change (i mean solely the buff of locks) was NOT NECCESSARY IN ANY WAY</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is wrong unless it's changed on the PTR. Priests tooltip at Liveservers right now:<br />
<br />
&quot;Drains 1021 to 1079 mana from a target. For each mana drained in this way, the target takes 0.5 damage.&quot; It's not damage, then half mana. It's 1000~ mana and 500 damage, and it isn't affected by +spell damage, Berserk or Power Infusion.<br />
<br />
Then again, priests would be the new warlocks if Manaburn did 2042 to 2158 damage, and burned half the mana. Gief!</div></div><hr />

There is so much wrong about this it makes my head spin.<br />

Blink is instant cast, and the current bonus is a 2 second reduction to the cooldown. Im going to guess its supposed to be 'reduces the cooldown of blink by 4 seconds' instead.</div></div><hr />

Are you kidding me?!? NO druid uses healing touch. They replaced one of the strongest 4 piece set bonuses in the game, and a huge reason why druids are so strong in 2v2 and 3v3 with basically nothing.<br />
<br />
I understand that druids are over-represented in the smaller brackets so they need to get some kind of nerf, but at least give them SOMETHING.<br />
<br />
Might as well make the 4 piece resto set bonus be increased damage on ferocious bite, that spell is used about as often as healing touch.<br />
<br />
Why are they nerfing all the mana based classes? Aren't warriors and rogues already the most popular classes in arena? They nerf drinking to make all the mana classes worse, then they nerf mana drains which makes warlocks/priests/hunters worse and they nerf the elemental shaman 4 piece bonus when they are only good in 1 bracket as it is. /sigh</div></div><hr />

<br />
Priest: Drains 1021 to 1079 mana from a target. 3s cast<br />
Hunter: Stings the target, draining 1368 mana over 8 sec. 15s CD<br />
Wlock: 200 x5 sec channeled<br />
<br />
The hunter being instant, i would still argue is better than a channeled spell.<br />
<br />
The change just brings the 3 diffrent manadrains closer in perfomance.<br />
<br />
Sure in the worst case scenario now the wlock is better off, if the person being drained is in LOS the whole duration. In most cases it evens out alot more tbh.<br />
<br />
warlock-always drain if gets out of range/vision some mana ticks will drain(if got dispelled can be count as a extra tick)<br />
priest- if get out of range/vision is cancelled(2 secs if is improved)<br />
hunter- if u play against druids pallys or shamans is dispelled really fast, dwarfs can remove it one time<br />
personally i think isnt a nerf to locks 50% increase - 20% reduced by resilence gear = 30% more than live servers</div></div><hr />

Also, Drain Mana was the best drain then, it's the best drain now by an absurd amount. No cooldown, ignores LOS. Mana Burn can be LOS'd with ease, Viper can be easily cleansed and has a lengthy cooldown. <br />
<br />
The Drain Mana buff was absurd, there's no logic for it whatsoever outside of favoritism, period. If they made LOS clip it then added the buff, I could understnad, but this is just bullshit, really.<br />
<br />
Warlocks get off scott free from the Drain nerf, Priests have to spend over half of what the actually burn burns now, and Hunters basically just got hit by a sledge hammer.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. The mana-drain is still pretty shitty, compared to the Priest/Hunter. Esp. the Hunter, he just needs to hit you once and can make damage afterwards, throughout the whole time. While the lock had to stand and drain mana...LOL. They should have increased it to 400 at least.</div></div><hr />
