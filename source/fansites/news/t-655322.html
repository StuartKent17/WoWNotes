In patch 3.2, Call of the Crusade, players will be able to work toward the all-new tier-9 class sets by competing in the Crusaders' Coliseum. To keep with the themes of the Argent Tournament, players will notice this time around that the Horde and Alliance have unique looks to distinguish them apart. <br />

<br />
<br />
Indeed , they better work nicely over T 10 if it is indeed Icecrown ( as they stated so far )<br />
<br />
But we have to wait for next build to see more T9 content I think.</div></div><hr />

Which is fine by me.<br />
<br />
This time is different though - aren't the Horde and Alliance versions supposed to be completely different? So really they're doing 8 armor models (instead of the usual 10) and 20 skins.<br />
<br />
I'm possibly completely wrong, and probably partially wrong.</div></div><hr />

I could be wrong here, but from what I've seen of the Argent Tournament there will be several levels of difficulty, perhaps these are the sets that will be easily obtained through 10/25 regular. I'm hoping that the gear obtained in Heroic modes has a bit more flair or I think every raider in Tier 7/8 is going to be slightly let down when upgrading into these T9 pieces. <br />
<br />
I was happy to hear that I won't look the same as the Horde Priest in T9... but looking like the other Alliance Mages/Warlocks made me meh...</div></div><hr />

Try making an armor set that will look appealing to over 10 million people.<br />
<br />
Granted they dont look extravagant with a million lightbulbs attached to them and turning your character into a particle effect factory but I like how the sets are looking so far! specially the horde ones!</div></div><hr />

They're just palette swaps. :(<br />
<br />
Where's the fun in that?<br />
<br />
<br />
They look alright though. They're nice and shiny and definitely fit the &quot;Alliance theme&quot; Blizz said they were going for, for the sets in a recent blue post.</div></div><hr />

Guys, this is like eating caviar all day long. You'll lose the taste for it. So those sets look too boring? Maybe they are. Compared to T8. But if T9 (or whatever you want to call it) was super mega awesome, the Icecrown set would be totally unimpressive and nothing to look up to in the first place.<br />
<br />
Also, colloseum. Arena style. And what did Blizz say about PVP sets? They're suposed to get the job done, that's it. If I get my raiding job done in those sets, who cares?</div></div><hr />

Seeing how they're trying to make more ways of milking money out of the game [e.g. - Faction change]... and they're cutting corners with 'costs' with these pathetic excuses for new sets... I'm seriously losing my respect for Blizz, to which I used to hold to high regards.<br />

Cloth all look the same except for different colors and what not. This is the Argent Tournament and are using this coliseum to pick a select few to go &quot;assult&quot; Icecrown Citadel. Well think military and think uniforms. Identical type even. Figuring everyone is now &quot;working&quot; for the Argent Crusade in order to do a small man assulat against the citadel, might as well have everyone be wearing the same uniform. <br />
<br />
This is the thought I would guess why Blizzard is putting us in the same (different color) design. We are basically trying out for the select few special forces of the Argent Crusade to do an assult on Icecrown citadel. Uniforms are a must in the grand scheme of the military even though it might make you stop and wonder why the heck would it look like that.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's people caring about looking the same, it's more about Blizzard making millions, if not billions, a year yet their imagination in gear design is pathetic. You'd think they'd at least put in the effort to make the different classes look unique and not just give the same proficiency the exact same model.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, when T8 came out I was more than happy with its design, as It all looked completely fresh. The only downside to this of course was the fact that they gave every single item in ulduar the same skin, just with a different colour out of their crayon collection.<br />
<br />
These tier 9 designs are not only completely lazy, but also remind me of pretty much any green or blue quality item ingame. Look at the sets, remove the glowing bits from the shoulders and helm, then you'll see exactly what I mean, especially the horde leather, not so much the alliance cloth.<br />

<br />
Wth? Were you even around when T2 was?<br />
<br />
Tier 2 is still to date the best set ever made for some classes, namely shamans for which it is the only true shaman set out there bar T1, but ive heard other classes such as paladins expresss their love for it. Tier 2 was a splendid tier and should not be dissed and especially not compare to this.<br />
<br />
This is just crap, its lazy and it doesnt even look diverse or looks to fit the classes which would be the only excuse for making something look like dungeon blues. If you want to make a set that has nothing to do with the classes, which is what blizzard have done since TBC, then at least fill it up with enough graphical goodies to look cool. These sets are bland and boring, and the entire &quot;horde set, alliance set&quot; sounds like a horrible cop-out by a lazy dev team.<br />

Bad armour to fit what looks so far like a horrible patch....</div></div><hr />

uhm... No one here is or pretends to be a developer, no one here has the trainng or the capabilities, no one here earns his living by doing just that, developing this stuff.<br />
<br />
So... your argument fails hard. Actually the &quot;don't like it? You do it!&quot; argument fails pretty much every time.<br />
<br />
We know Blizzard can make great stuff, we saw that with Ulduar, T8, which are, across the board, among the best Tier-sets ever imho, we actually see that right now with Season 7 (or 8? which is the one in 3.2?) gear. The 3.2 PvP gear looks better than all the &quot;T9&quot;-sets and every class looks vastly different.<br />
<br />
They better share their philosophy behind this &quot;let's make them all look the same&quot; decision, otherwise the only conclusion I can come to is laziness. And naming this.... crap after Lore characters is even more of a slap in the face. &quot;Awesome, Thrall's armor, so to speak, awesome! uhm... Thrall's armor looks exactly the same as Sylvanas' armor...?&quot;</div></div><hr />

completely true, and lets not forget Mr Holylighter (this nick makes me think about an alliance paly, but just a presumption) that we are paying some money (not ingame gold) to this company for a pleasure of us , i am paying monthly bc i want to play something that i like, and i pay them because i trust them...so if they do this lazy work , this &quot;lack of imagination&quot; job , then is their problem to make a new development team, bc like one_entity say , we are not developers :))) .... u don't get it??

think of it this way...when america's army goes to war do u see the medics wearing something super extravagant? do u see the snipers wearing bright light bulbs on their shoulders with an arrow pointing to them? do u see the regular ppl wearing super big shoulder pads? nah they all wear somthing along the same line of everyone else...they all match.<br />
<br />
chances are there is gonna be a big war like ahn'qiraj and its going to be pretty BA so bliz wants us to look like an army assembled outside the Citadel to face arthas's scourge. the alliance will look like an Alliance army, and the Horde will look like a Horde army. i honestly thing the sets they've rolled out look pretty amazing tbh and each class has its own type of design for the armor dk's have a skull and what not pallies have the lion of stormwind, warriors the sword on their chest. horde shamans im kinda jealous of t1 just updated graphics :D &lt;3. <br />
<br />
we're lucky that blizzard even included a tier of gear in this patch. in Vanilla and TBC there were only 3 sets of tier gear and a inbetween set or just random gear that matched together. blizzard admitted in vanilla wow that coming up with new armor sets is very hard to do and its hard to come up with new fresh ideas. <br />
<br />
imo the sets look great :D keep up the good work blizz</div></div><hr />

The Argent Crusade is putting together a strike force of the toughest heroes to send into Icecrown Citadel. When the heroes are chosen from the Coliseum, the Argent Crusade will outfit them in the best gear available from them.<br />

If an army is outfitting you, chances are you're going to look like the soldier to your right and left, with minor variation.

stop paying for this crap than! blizz is stealin ur monehz. you pay but you don't get anything. don't pay! they are stealing your money!<br />

<br />
Everyone who like those sets is blizzard employee or they are said to grow up ... lame guys.<br />
Arguments like &quot;you are rich hire every homeless guy you see to make content&quot; ...<br />
<br />
Is it so hard to undertand that someone can actionly like those sets?<br />
Is it so hard to undertand that someone hate those sets?<br />
<br />
Respect guys ... restect ... and that comes to both sides.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see any proper discusion here about WHY you like them or not.<br />
<br />
I'm personally slightly neutral about those sets. I like Aliance color scheme and design is more military like which goes with idea of army.<br />
What is do not like is Horde in both aspects, color and look also. Yet again they design Horde more brutal and savage which is in my eyes not true anymore.<br />
I see this military look as contraproductive in case of druids, but you can argument with PvP sets, so might also work for people.<br />
<br />
But if you count number of core designes, then you get to 6 sets (2x cloth,leather,plate/mail). In class design it's 10. <br />
<br />
I personaly think that core set design is not so big part of work on patch that 4 sets would bring a really significant time/work save. <br />
<br />
My bet is that they wanted to bring up more of Aliance/Horde marching army feeling. Whether it was a good move ... that is the question.<br />
<br />
Seems like a lot of people don't like it ... that I can respect and try to undestand ... but thay way they say it ... that I can't respect and undestand</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, it does make sense.<br />
<br />
But...<br />
1) Does anything in WoW make sense? Mobs dropping Armor? Bosses dropping Tokens which you can turn in for the best armor from some npc that hoards that stuff? Killing Bosses each week again?<br />
<br />
But ok, we'll roll with it. The &quot;outfitting an army&quot; makes somewhat sense (even though Tirion says that they don't need an army but a small strike team, sort of).<br />
<br />
But....<br />
<br />
2) Why name this, &quot;army-outfit&quot; after the Lore characters?! That's what actually breaks it for me. When we saw that the stuff would be named after important Lore characters I was really psyched &quot;yeah, that's gotta be some awesome armor to wear those names&quot; and all we get is this.<br />
<br />
If they named the T9-items not after Lore characters but just .... Argent Champions's Battlegear or Horde/Alliance Crusader's Battlegear or whatever, I would not be nearly as pissed. If the names and the meaning behind the names actually fit the generic look I would still be somewhat dissapointed but I'd be much more ok with it.<br />
<br />
If there is one thing I could ask of Blizzard it would not be to redo those things (3.2 will be a filler patch, let's be honest... the colloseum will be nice but it's no real successor to something like Ulduar) BUT to change the names to fit the generic looks and save the Lore character name idea for Tier 10 ... and make Tier 10 KICKASS.</div></div><hr />

Seeing how they're trying to make more ways of milking money out of the game [e.g. - Faction change]... and they're cutting corners with 'costs' with these pathetic excuses for new sets... I'm seriously losing my respect for Blizz, to which I used to hold to high regards.<br />
<br />
Sickening really.<br />
<br />
It's more likely that, as art assets are the most time-consuming part of the game to produce, they have the majority of their artists working on Icecrown mobs/items/doodads rather than they're &quot;going cheap&quot;. Especially since they have admitted that this content is intended to simply be a stepping stone to Icecrown.<br />
<br />
Of all the ways to get art created under deadline for an established property with a particular aesthetic, flash-hiring a large amount of temps/freelancers to fill in the cracks is about the shortest route to the shittiest possible result.</div></div><hr />

LOL, not all wow community hates them , we are simply not used with this new &quot;dipers&quot; , they look the same and not sophisticated (we were kinda spoiled :)))) ) , what i mean is that ppl like to see diferences between classes , i mean graphical ones :))) i have a lock and a drood , so for drood new forms are best thing evere :)) but for lock ... is terrible, i like this game because is all about mathematics :)))))) is not a playstation game.... but like i stopped raiding since ulduar appeared (i just dont like Ulduar and all this giant stuff ) i hope that T 10 and Arthas will come soon :D, but if u like them u must explain why , maybe &quot;the hatters&quot; :)) will see your point of view ;)<br />

Well think military and think uniforms. Identical type even. Figuring everyone is now &quot;working&quot; for the Argent Crusade in order to do a small man assulat against the citadel, might as well have everyone be wearing the same uniform. <br />
<br />
This is the thought I would guess why Blizzard is putting us in the same (different color) design. We are basically trying out for the select few special forces of the Argent Crusade to do an assult on Icecrown citadel. Uniforms are a must in the grand scheme of the military even though it might make you stop and wonder why the heck would it look like that.<br />

QFT<br />
<br />
Besides, what's so wrong about these sets anyway? As for the complaints about Blizz being lazy. Well lets see.. Normally we have 1 set for each tier and class, disregarding different colors that comes to 10 art models for the tier gear. Here we have 1 per armor proficiency and faction, this comes out to 8 art models. Add to that the subtle differences in the plate armors for instance, meaning that they may have put slightly less time designing the gear, but not a significant amount as it were.<br />
<br />
Also, could we just stop whining about things we haven't seen yet? There's 3 different iLvl's for the tier 9, what's there to say that the sets won't be more intricate as we move from 232 -&gt; 245 -&gt; 258 like the pvp season sets? These are starting to look fantastic btw.<br />
<br />
To top it all off, some are asking for justification for creating similar if not identical sets for the respective armor proficiencies and its been said numerous times in this thread, and by Blizzard themselves: It's a f'in WAR EFFORT! Why would the argent crusade create intricate sets for each class just for the looks? Why would the rogue set have a head on its head? It makes sense that these are armor sets made for, you guessed it, functionality. Mind-blowing isn't it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">det</div><div class="date">2009-07-03, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Find it disgusting that Blizzard, a multi million dollar company, are going cheap and doing reskinning of the same models for different classes instead of actual different models for them set pieces.<br />
<br />
Seeing how they're trying to make more ways of milking money out of the game [e.g. - Faction change]... and they're cutting corners with 'costs' with these pathetic excuses for new sets... I'm seriously losing my respect for Blizz, to which I used to hold to high regards.<br />
<br />
Sickening really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I dunno. Two points:<br />
<br />
Where does it state, that we are paying for the patches? I say it at least 3.1 and 3,2 are free content. 3.3..guess I paid for that, because Arthas is on the box and not in the game, so I want him. Other than that you paid 35 for the expansion and 15 each month to play on Blizzards server<br />
<br />
Obviously people would QQ that Blizzard is &quot;milking money out of the game [e.g. - Faction change]&quot;. Which I find is the totally most unreasonable statement. Guess what? Nobody puts a gun to your head and forces you to change. Is it Blizzards fault that you didn't roll <br />
<br />
-a class you like, <br />
-a faction you like, <br />
-a race you like<br />
-on a server you like?</div></div><hr />

I play WoW to have at least a tiny bit of distinction in my character.<br />
That is why I play in a progress guild and not in a casual one. To get titles.<br />
Back in TBC and Vanilla you could tell from a character how hardcore player he / she is by just looking at it. Nowadays with all the free epics you can only tell the difference with the aid of titles / achievements, but at least the armors looked cool.<br />
T7 looked like T3 we aaccepted that, Naxx is Naxx and only a few ppl had the opportunity to wear the old naxx armor.<br />
T8 looked awesome in most cases.<br />
But T9...I completely agree with those who are disappointed.<br />
<br />
Military-reasons, small strike force? well let's go in Twill Cover to disguise ourselves....<br />
I can imagine Arthas looking at the raid...&quot;Well let's see they have one paladin, two warriors, three death knights....or wait...no it's 2 DKs 1 Warr...ARRRGH, SERVANTS, MORE LIGHT plz, i can't tell the difference!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
- All plate wearers use the same armor models, but with slightly altered skins. Same goes for the rest of the armor classes.<br />
- T9 is completely buyable with badges<br />
- Badges are available though Daily Hero Quests and the raid instance (which certainly isn't going to be hard in the &quot;easy mode&quot; setting).<br />

<br />
Because it is the interwebz. Everybody can hide behind their screen and give uninformed opinions. These days, everyone is a designer, politician, artist and philosopher and ... hey..you see everyday on TV and on the radio how random joes are asked for their opinion as if it MATTERS.<br />
<br />

<br />
We want to enjoy the game between patches and for PvE that seems to be fine because Ulduar's a great instance. In PvP though the gameplay is terrible and blizzard are going the wrong way with everything :( Just sad the way they're making this game... Didn't they get 10 million subscribers in tbc or something? That just shows how good their previous game/design was compared to WOTLK :(<br />
<br />
In TBC i was constantly logging on trying to improve my character or just idling in shattrath cuz it was a cool place to chill. In WOTLK i can't stand Dalaran, im either in the sewers or not there and i dont feel compelled to log on anymore and i just log in a few days a week for arena.<br />
<br />
The tier9 looks are so so bad though. Looking at previous sets, blizzard won't change their mind about them regardless of feedback which just makes me sad cuz they are really really bad. lol@tier8 set, best looking set this expansion, it was on youtube way BEFORE WOTLK was even released... Thats how long ago they designed the best set this expansion lmao, a year or more ago? AFAIK nothing changed there.<br />
<br />
Whats with the new battleground? Its going to be ridiculous if you're tying to go on foot/mount anywhere. You have air strikes coming down from above and cannons shooting at the ground all the time along with anti-player vehicles? Its just ruining PvP combat even more. You can have an epic fight then be low HP and get 1shot by an air strike or random cannon/vehicle... SKILLGAME. Srsly, im not stepping foot in that disaster.<br />

&quot;In patch 3.2, Call of the Crusade, players will be able to work toward the all-new tier-9 class sets by competing in the Crusaders' Coliseum. To keep with the themes of the Argent Tournament, players will notice this time around that the Horde and Alliance have unique looks to distinguish them apart.&quot;<br />

Hmn, not only are classes being moved together away from their original benefits, perposes, and the reason we chose that class; not only are locks becoming mages; not only are we sharing the stats with most other classes of our type; not only are most of the models in game just other colours of one model; but now were getting tier loot that looks exactly the same as everyone else, and the tokens are just one standard token, and the tier looks crap.<br />
<br />
Heres an idea, maybe blizzard is getting close to the release of their other mmo and they're just trying to insult us and piss us off so we'll all move over to that, its certainly working.<br />
<br />
Oh and screw bring the person not the class, 8 out of 10 wow players are simply morons that dont deserve to be dragged through ulduar or whatever top instance, speaking as an idiot thats got to yogg but then spent the rest of the time trying to drag noobs kicking and screaming through the easy fights because they &quot;want Kewl loots :) :) :)&quot;, either make raids a tank and spank or just forget about getting the noobs the experience of raiding, because believe me youll never win.</div></div><hr />

Uhm, you can already see Horde Plate - Horde Warrior is therre. Dk and Paladin will look pretty much the same, just slighty different colorings and ... oh, how do I know... oh, what great surprise, skulls for Death Knights...<br />
<br />
The Alliance Plate is at least nondescript enough to sort of fit either Plate-wearing class.<br />
<br />
But the Horde Plate... can anyone honestly say this looks fit for a Paladin and a Death Knight?<br />
<br />
Actually I like the Horde Plate, it looks awesome, it looks &quot;Horde&quot;... but ONLY for Warriors. This is a Warrior-set.<br />
<br />

warriors dont want to look like paladins and dks<br />
warlocks dont want to look like mages and priests<br />
shamans and hunters dont want to look the same<br />
rogues and druids dont want to look the same<br />
<br />
i, as a warrior, would rather look like every other warrior in the game, than look like every warrior in the game.... in addition to every dk and pally in the game. if i wanted to look like a DK, then i would have rolled one, if i had wanted to look like a paladin, then i would have rolled one.<br />
<br />
im sure blizzard fired the guy that said doing it this way was a bad idea.<br />
<br />
blizzard did (and is currently working on) 4 sets for horde and 4 sets for alliance. thats 8 sets. they could have gone ahead and just made the 2 extra armor sets and everyone would have gear unique to their class.<br />

The Alliance Plate is at least nondescript enough to sort of fit either Plate-wearing class.<br />

But the Horde Plate... can anyone honestly say this looks fit for a Paladin and a Death Knight?<br />

Actually I like the Horde Plate, it looks awesome, it looks &quot;Horde&quot;... but ONLY for Warriors. This is a Warrior-set.<br />

You must be part of those 8 players because you obviously don't understand what bring the player not the class means. It means that instead of bringing 5 shaman for heroism for every group, or needing these four specs in your melee group you can bring the good players, no matter what class they play. They're moving away from bringing crappy players because they have the buffs you need. Go read about the design philosophy before you write it off.</div></div><hr />

I know your point, thats why my paragraph didnt criticise that theory, as my paragraph said, i was focusing on the result of what happens with that - the resultant lack of diversity becuase every calss must have aoe - single target - replenishment - raid buffs - high damage/healing - be able to use X type of weapon - be able to cc - be able reduce dmg taken..... etc etc</div></div><hr />

I agree. It's pretty obvious the bulk of their talent isn't working on WoW anymore.<br />
<br />
And people claiming they don't care about what they look like, are lying. You care. If Blizzard gave you a pink dress as a Warrior and you had to wear it on your male toon, you'd care. Unless of course, you're into that sort of thing.</div></div><hr />

Why would they give you such an awesome set to BUY at vendors? Yes, the majority of the armor (except for the highest ilevel gear) can be purchased with triumphs. If you haven't checked recently at the tokens for it:<br />
<br />
Lowest - between 30-45 triumphs<br />
Medium - between 60-75 triumphs<br />
Highest - one token<br />
<br />
The sets aren't THAT bad, could be worse. Just be glad our gear here looks better than pretty much the gear in any other MMO.<br />

exactly, its not stupid though imo there is so much diversity, if you think about it who cares if you have to share the same model as another class on ur faction...each armor has its own look to it: priest gear looks sooo good with the alliances colors. the paladin armor is really well done. they are preparing us for a war. we are very effin lucky to even get a tier from this instance, all the QQing needs to stop if you wanna quit b/c of this fine make my day go play aion, wow will be better off w/o complainers like you guys. <br />

Blizz is trying to get us 1 more patch b4 citadel which is going to be probably one of the most epic fights/patches since Ahn'Qiraj. the new instance they are taking a new step with a new instance type. which i think is going to be fun, quick so we can still go do ulduar and get our healers their legendary.<br />

Now don't get me wrong, sets are looking fine, maybe sort of off the usual style, but hey, everybody needs some diversity (one of the reasons i dont play now). They look good, sharp, with nice textures etc.<br />
<br />
I'm just a little disappointed, thinking you actually get 20 models instead of usual 10.<br />
<br />
Personally I think making a distinct look for every race/class combo out there could be too much work, which is rather sad considering that Silvermoon mages should look diffrent than those of the Darkspear tribe... Just consider a few sets of fine, violet/red/gold silken garments with blood elven distinctions and some arcane tribal wrappings with voodoo masks.<br />
<br />
That is, unfortunately, due to massive amount of work involved and alot of Blizzard staff involved in other project, impossible.<br />
<br />
But just think about AT LEAST for one time alliance warlock looking like alliance warlock and nothing like horde warlock or alliance mage. And I dont mean the colors. I mean the fuming skulls on pikes against the fel infused flying crystals against glowing rune patterns...</div></div><hr />

Agreeeed. T10 should be like T6 with more then just the basic pieces of Tier. T9, if that's the name you want to give it, was just something Blizz threw together (since cloth/plate for each class look EXACTLY THE SAME). T10 is Icecrown, the Final Showdown pretty much, it better be Amazing instead of like.....well......most of the Tier so far in Wrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, this is just plain lame.<br />
<br />
I suggest, that if Blizzard's artists and designers are getting really lazy, that Blizzar will make somekind of contest to design the next tier armor sets (T10) so that it won't look too lame...I mean, yes the designs are nice, but if everyone is to look the same, its stupid.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tatanke</div><div class="date">2009-07-03, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right im not a fan of complaining but, i do think constructive criticism has its place. In my opinion(i may be wrong) our characters are and have always not been part of some army. From level 1 to 80 we are supposed to be heroes, not generic soldier B.<br />
<br />
Take for example, the MH battle, its pretty clear there is an army there to fight the dark forces. Are we a part of it? I think not. We stand as a group of heroes(our uniform being our guild tabard imo) there to aid the army our vice versa how ever you see it.<br />
<br />
I personally started playing just after vanilla, and was most impressed with all the sets from T4-T6. I thought they were very creative and albeit only a visual aspect to they game i was proud to wear the gear i had, and felt like i had achieved something every time i opened my login screen.<br />
<br />
When T7 came out i wasnt impressed that Blizz had reused old sets but at the same time i thought they were significantly improved and felt right with the content, so i was happy enough.<br />
Again T8 is out and im starting to get more and more disheartened with the skin sharing between tier and non tier items, but the models looked great so meh.<br />
<br />
Finally we have the colleseum and it lacks the epic feel of good versus evil that were in the previous content. Hey heres a bunch of random crap that you've killed while questing! now kill it again in a ring!!...........<br />
And our reward for this; items that if i had designed i would be embarresed to show family members.<br />
<br />
Previous sets were always very &quot;class looking&quot; and when you put the new stuff alongside the changes to streamline to an extent raid buffs( of which i am in strong favour of) your left with a bunch of clones with no feeling of identity. <br />
<br />
Blizzard are often seen to have said if something is important we prefer to do it properly than rush it. And have also said &quot; A great company admits to its mistakes and tries to build from it&quot;.<br />
<br />
So maybe get rid of the sets and start afresh and make something you guys can be proud of. I,m more than happy to wait.<br />
<br />
<br />
To all the people who say try design something that 10 million will like, just look at this thread i'd say at a glance about 2% of the posters were semi happy/ok with the sets, and i was under the impression blizz leaned towards the majority rules.<br />
<br />
So performance review for the art team?? i think it looks like a solid yes..........</div></div><hr />

Who's to say that's not what the T10 sets will be like? Honestly I think people are getting a bit too excited about this. I'll take Blizz's side in this argument, just to play devil's advocate.<br />
<br />
Normally, we get 10 new sets within a patch, but Blizz wanted this armor to feel more team-y than the last sets, and so they cut it down so that the armor classes each share a model. They didn't do this because they were lazy, they did it because that was the feel they wanted to create. Now, they felt the reaction to only releasing 4 sets instead of 10 would be overwhelming negative (and we all know if there had only been 4 sets released, this thread would be 30+ pages of QQ) so they made the Alliance/Horde sets separate. Creates more faction pride, and I like it a lot, personally. Now we're up to 8 sets, comparable to the amount released in each patch so far. They've managed to retain (in the gear!) the idea that we are a team, gearing up AS A TEAM, to take on one of the biggest baddies Azeroth has seen. Nothing lazy, nothing cheap, just the way they intended it. <br />
<br />
(Naturally I have no evidence to support any of these claims, but before you hop on the Blizz-bashing train, think about it. Not trying to force my ideas on anyone, just trying to encourage intelligent thought.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now don't get me wrong, sets are looking fine, maybe sort of off the usual style, but hey, everybody needs some diversity (one of the reasons i dont play now). They look good, sharp, with nice textures etc.<br />
<br />
I'm just a little disappointed, thinking you actually get 20 models instead of usual 10.<br />
<br />
Personally I think making a distinct look for every race/class combo out there could be too much work, which is rather sad considering that Silvermoon mages should look diffrent than those of the Darkspear tribe... Just consider a few sets of fine, violet/red/gold silken garments with blood elven distinctions and some arcane tribal wrappings with voodoo masks.<br />
<br />
That is, unfortunately, due to massive amount of work involved and alot of Blizzard staff involved in other project, impossible.<br />
<br />
But just think about AT LEAST for one time alliance warlock looking like alliance warlock and nothing like horde warlock or alliance mage. And I dont mean the colors. I mean the fuming skulls on pikes against the fel infused flying crystals against glowing rune patterns...<br />
<br />
<br />
lol chill out? really do i seem mad?<br />
<br />
I'm not, I'm satisfied with the current t9 i play a draenei shaman and cant wait to see what they came up with for alliance mail. if its not the greatest o well by 2010 we'll have t10, which im sure will look pretty good. But for blizz to go and make each race a set would be crazy mad...you wouldnt see this patch for another 6 months if that was the case. If they did I'm sure there would be a ton of QQ about how long they are taking on visual models for each race/class. Also that would take out a lot of models they could use for future sets of tiers. i mean Christ all we're getting is 2 less different models and people are qqing about diversity. <br />
<br />
then again i don't see enough hunters/shamans in current t8 to have to worry about o man that kid over there looks like me. but i do see casuals ending up with the t9.33(is this what we'll call it now that there will be 3 sets?) or t9.66(lawl). but hey idc as long as i look good idc if anyone else has that armor. blizz would have a pretty difficult time making everyone happy <br />
<br />
<br />

hunter and shaman have same models look closer there is horns on the shaman suit and im not seeing the mud/earth im seeing lava or a t1 mixed with a t5 set which looks great :D makes me want to play horde shaman again</div></div><hr />

So basically if you can kill the last boss in what seems to be the most easiest 5 man instances ever, you are on your way to being worthy enough to defeating the lich king IMO. I could WELL be wrong because i havent been following this patch as much as other people and i would like to know if i am wrong or not.<br />
<br />
Personally i think that what blizzard has done with these sets is a complete and utter disgrace, they are putting zero effort into making sets. Although WoW does follow a story line to an extent but everyone, yes EVERYONE always enjoys looking nice in the gear they acquire, you dont look at your own character and think WOW i look soooo suitable standing here in the Argent Crusade, i would rather stand in dalaran and everyone admire me, not follow some crap lore shit.<br />

Its totally sad that Blizzard can't find the time to make Tier models anymore, first they take away PvP Recolor'ed Tier which was awesome, WTB it back please, but when Blizzard resorts to this crap, it makes me just want to quit the game. I mean do they not realize that part of the reason that new tier piece is awesome is because it looks awesome and doesn't look like the same crap as the other armor types around.<br />
<br />
All I have to say is they need to stop being lazy with this game, I know they have D2 and Sc2 coming, but that doesn't mean they need to be taking a big crap on 12 million of us that still play their best game released to date. I swear if T10 doesn't blow our socks off, I am quitting eternally for Aion(however I might just quit for Aion anyways).<br />

In my opinion they are a victim of their own policies, they would not need to toss out cheap content if the current content was released earlier and kept harder for longer. So far the arena model has tanked, and tanked hard. And by the looks of it the causal model is failing just as bad, forcing the company to create more content for which they are not willing to release the needed resources to keep up the quality. American and Euro markets are in decline and the only numbers keeping WoW even looking like there is nothing wrong is the Asian/Eastern Euro markets, which do not bring in near the same amount of profit. So everyone enjoy, your witnessing the decline of WoW.<br />

Lead Designer: Yo noob morning<br />
Project Supervisor: Morning dude, are the new tiers ready ?<br />
L.D. : Meh, maybe, i think Tom finished them last night<br />
P.S. : Tom ?... wtf ? is not he the janitor ? <br />
L.D.: Yeh noob...budget cuts..<br />
P.S.: Meh ok, lets take a look<br />
P.S.: Ohhhh this looks cool man!!! Much better then the last ones!!!<br />
L.D.: Yeh well we didn't have Tom then<br />
P.S.: You think they will like them ? i mean i like them but you know how players are...<br />

T: Now wtf dude ? this tiers are PERFECT, look at them! works of arts, would you have preferred i recolored AQ40 ?<br />
L.D.: Ah come on mate, don't be so hard on Tom, i think he did great. Besides, will get only little QQ cause they will be to busy QQing about the mods second floor will do to the classes :D<br />
P.S.: Ah crap, would not wanna be in there shoes, ah well i guess this works, still think its better then the last ones...<br />
L.D: I resent that!<br />
T: Besides guys, if they dont like it so what ?.. what are they gonna do ? stop playing ? neahh just fill forums of hateful threads and we got a lot of server space so...<br />

<br />
It is a little odd for this to be called Tier 9 considering it has been a short time since the release of ulduar, that and the fact that they are going to be reskins provided for all types of armor.<br />
<br />
For those who complain that everyone will look the same, i am pretty sure a lot of folks have come to that conclusion ever since introductory content was able to be cleared in one raid lockout period.<br />

Nobody brought up sunwell and season 5 gear being reskins of a few models because a small percentage of the wow population had the patience and coordination to clear it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's ok. The hunter and shaman set even has some differences in appearance, not just colour.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keoren</div><div class="date">2009-07-04, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they fit reasonably well with the Argent theme, even though many sets could've been done better to please visually. I'm overall quite satisfied with the cloth sets. Mage set in general looks good to me, I'm liking the colours. Sharing the same model, even if lame, does fit the idea of a uniform.</div></div><hr />

I believe its stupid- tiers were those parts of armor that could be recognizable without inspecting. Now we are going to have 10 ppl in raid look exactly the same.<br />

<br />
Differences from each other, but, as I pointed out on Page 13, the Hunter design is -very- similar to Tier 6.5 (save the shoulders), and the Shaman design looks an awful lot like their Tier 1 (save the helm and the change to pants):<br />

Maybe Blizzard is just trying to save the planet and go e-&quot;Green&quot; with all of this recycling.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GRQUEST</div><div class="date">2009-07-04, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand where people are coming from in saying Blizzard is lazy in only creating faction/armor proficiency specific sets. But quite frankly, I wouldn't want to be the guy that has to redraw the textures for any of those sets. They did a pretty good job with what they were trying to achieve. Though there is no clear distinction between armor models (Plate, mail, etc.) they still look pretty cool. Also be aware that there is lore involved, we are pitted against the most &quot;fearsome&quot; beasts this game has to offer as training. Eventually we'll have to take down Arthas. The Argent Crusade is mass producing armor and they don't exactly have a team of people saying, &quot;Hey Jimbo, I need 10,000 jars of flaming brains for these shoulderpads, and Timmy, gimme 5,000 pumpkins to carve as helmets.&quot; That's just not reasonable. They're going to use the most practical method for developing these pieces of armor which means recycling boots, gloves, and so on. Make sense? OK then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very lame that all the armors of same type share the same graphics tho.</div></div><hr />

Those were cool faction based armor sets. And the weapons were pretty epic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coldviper18</div><div class="date">2009-07-05, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like the idea of these sets for PvP. But PvE essentially everyone's working at the same goal regardless of faction so thats where it shouldn't matter what faction.<br />
<br />
I don't hate hate the idea but I think they shoulda just made these the new season gear. And have different models based on class not faction.<br />
<br />
Honestly if they just swapped S7 models with T9, I think the majority would be happier. But w/e.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caradinist</div><div class="date">2009-07-05, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You compare the Tier 8 25 man pieces (or referred to as T8.5.) and the stats provided by the highest piece of tier 9 (going to be referred to as... T9.66 maybe?) and you will see that the stats increase is much higher than ever (from 226 gear to 258.)<br />
<br />
because of the difference, i am pretty sure even though nearly everyone in this thread does not like it, they are still going to wear it, because in the end, it is the stats that make your character (all dependent on class, not to mention who pushes buttons the best) better.<br />
<br />
Personally, even though i haven't seen the horde (paladin &amp; friends) plate armor, this armor, aesthetically, is decent at best. I understand that people are complaining because for the first time, this is new Tier gear that are reskins of pieces of armor, as opposed to the rest of the tier gear that has plenty and plenty of concept art behind it.<br />
<br />
If you notice, the Death knight Alliance and Warrior Alliance armor have textures that have been taken from their own respective Tier 8 gear. Some of the glowing jewel like pieces from the Tier 8 warrior armor slapped on to T9, and T8 skull like textures off the death knight applied to this new tier 9 armor.<br />
<br />
Like most folks said, even though it looks a little unoriginal, the new content that is going to be released (which by the way, the PTR was and has been going on for weeks now) looks like it's going to be released soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S:If you notice, all of the Tier gear except for this one, can only be acquired through storming a dungeon or fortress full of evil fucks and killing all the leaders, this is Tier gear that you will acquire winning in a contest of strength and all that jazz.</div></div><hr />

I don't see EVERYBODY doing Ulduar hero modes and the Coliseum should be even harder...</div></div><hr />
