The Illidari Council<br />
Illidan Stormrage<br />
Archimonde<br />
<br />
Our intent is not to make the encounters impossible. Even with the increased difficulty, I do expect some of them to be quickly beaten again after guilds experience the changes and adapt.<br />
As a side note, the 2.1.1 patch did include the change to the Archimonde encounter that increases his leash distance and made the Well of Eternity a bad place for casters to be near.<br />
<br />
Armory<br />
Blizzard released a new armory (http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#index.xml) (only available on the US site for the moment). <br />
Basically, they've got their own item database site now, you can search items based on item filters, bosses loot tables, etc ...<br />
<br />
Few sample of what you can do : <br />
<br />
Lady Vashj Loot Table (http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/#search.xml?searchType=items&amp;fl[source]=dungeon&amp;fl[difficulty]=normal&amp;fl=21212)<br />
<br />
Black Temple loot list (http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/search.xml?fl%5Bsource%5D=dungeon&amp;fl%5Bdungeon%5D=3959&amp;fl%5Bboss%5D=all&amp;fl%5Btype%5D=all&amp;fl%5BusbleBy%5D=all&amp;fl%5BrqrMin%5D=&amp;fl%5BrqrMax%5D=&amp;fl%5Brrt%5D=all&amp;advOptName=none&amp;fl%5Bandor%5D=and&amp;searchType=items&amp;fl%5BadvOpt%5D=none)<br />
Items only dropping in Heroic Mode for hunters (http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/search.xml?fl%5Bsource%5D=dungeon&amp;fl%5Bdungeon%5D=dungeons&amp;fl%5Bdifficulty%5D=heroic&amp;fl%5Btype%5D=all&amp;fl%5BusbleBy%5D=3&amp;fl%5BrqrMin%5D=&amp;fl%5BrqrMax%5D=&amp;fl%5Brrt%5D=all&amp;advOptName=none&amp;fl%5Bandor%5D=and&amp;searchType=items&amp;fl%5BadvOpt%5D=none)<br />
<br />
Like any other item database, Blizzard only adds item once they're dropped, you can't get Illidan loot table here. <br />

<br />
I just got done joking with a friend that after Nihilium finishes it they'll make it harder, apparently I wasn't far off..<br />
<br />
Gotta love the QQers in the WoW Forums winning.. they cry its too easy.. and Blizzard makes its insanely hard again =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
So sad.</div></div><hr />

you mean that we will only be able to see illidan's drops once all items droped from him had been droped by riders? no partial loot list in the armory</div></div><hr />
