<meta name="description" content="Arena Season 2 on PTR 
Still don't know when we'll get the next PTR patch, which means we can't get more stats for the moment. We're pretty sure that the new patch will include new epic boots/belt/wrists matching each arena sets, new epic misc. items (Neck/Ring/Trinket/Whatever makes Blizzard happy) 
Cockatrice and Elekk PvP mount are also in the 2.1.2 game files, don't know if they'll be included. 
 
Updates 
Infineon updated his Fraps Tutorial with Dual Core and Windowed Mode informations." />

Updates<br />
Infineon updated his Fraps Tutorial (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=293.0) with Dual Core and Windowed Mode informations.<br />
The map of the Sha'tari Skyguards Guide (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=253) has been updated with a few more locations.<br />
The Hall of Fame (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=107) is now complete, it probably won't need to be updated for a while and a better version could be available soon. <br />
I added the Arena Season 2 sets skins previews to the Arena Rating Calculator (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=249). I also added a small line at the bottom of the page to let you know when the calculator has been upgraded, to make sure that the formula is up to date.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's all for the moment, should have more interesting things coming soon. (Tomorrow if I don't slack too much)<br />
<br />
Addon Highlight<br />
A lot of people have been asking about it on the forums, I thought it could be a good thing to mention Ratingbuster (http://www-en.curse-gaming.com/downloads/details/4991/).<br />
On most of my items screenshots, you can notice stats summary, and rating conversion into %, that's the mod that does everything. It's very customizeable and I suggest that you read the whole mod description on Curse to tweak it to your desires. <br />

<br />
For your rings and trinkets the (-30|+0) is comparing what you are mousing over to your (Top|Bottom) rings and trinkets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It should. At least it did on my warlock when I used it.</div></div><hr />

I wan't it to compare fire spell dmg, spell hit, spell crit, intellect. if you can compare more stats than 4 at once I would also like it to compare stamina. thanks! :-)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flammable</div><div class="date">2007-06-12, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just want to add that the addon which shows you the currently equipped gear in that slot when you select another item is called &quot;EQCompare&quot;. You can find it at www.wowace.com/files .<br />
<br />
The Hall of Fame is really great, I love reading about WoW's history. Do you think its possible to find out who killed Lusifron up to Ragnaros? That would be really great.<br />
<br />
Also, just another bit of information... On my travels around the various WoW fansites, I found a very interesting video on worldofwar that had an intereview with some of the developers.<br />
<br />
A summary of what was said was basically:<br />
Onyxia deep breath was 100% random, it wasnt triggered by lack of dots or standing too close. One patch it bugged which led to much speculuation on the forums.<br />
<br />
Naxxramas was the dungeon most effort was put into and the plans for it had been set out before WoW even shipped.<br />
<br />
The craze of guilds releasing kill movies was something unheard of in previous MMOs because you didnt want to reveal your strategy to anyone. It started because a guild called Conquest were punished by WoW for exploiting in Molten Core (back in the day) and to get their own back on Blizzard they released kill movies and tactics.<br />
<br />
WoW developers actually have their own guild on live servers but they are only doing KZ casually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes. It even takes your different druid forms into account, assuming you're in the form when you look at the item.</div></div><hr />

I stumbled upon a video on youtube from this site. Its of coilfang solo and i need help to identify the addons being used. The health/mana bars, the map, the cast bar, sidebars, and most important the way the inventory looks, about 1:50 into the video a chest gets opened and u can clearly see that the items received look different from a GUI addon. Anybody, please list the addons being used so i can d/l them. If possible post links to wich addons are being used. Greatly Apreciated. TYVM!</div></div><hr />
