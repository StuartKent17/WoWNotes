Dev Watercooler -- The Role of Role<br />
The Deluge<br />
A monsoon is coming. We will soon inundate you with Mists of Pandaria information, starting with the upcoming media event and everything that follows. It’s going to be a very exciting time for World of Warcraft, and we are all super impatient for it to happen.<br />
<br />
But… we’re not quite there yet. I want to make that clear upfront, because this blog isn’t directly Mists of Pandaria related. You won’t find any announcements here, just a philosophical discussion that you may or may not find interesting. If you’re looking for thrilling announcements, you know what I’m going to say: Soon™.<br />
<br />
Multiple DPS Roles<br />
I said this blog isn’t directly relevant though, because I want to discuss a topic that we did struggle with a lot during Mists development, and indeed through most of World of Warcraft. We have classes with multiple DPS specs, and for mage, warlock, hunter, rogue, warrior and death knight, there isn’t even a melee vs. ranged distinction between those DPS specs. The question comes up all the time: “what is the role of these roles?” I don’t think there is a right answer here, and we’ve even changed the design a few times over the last several years. Again, I’m not couching this in terms of an imminent announcement or anything. This is fundamentally one of those designs that could go in a lot of different directions. It’s something we discuss a lot, and we figured given the strong opinions of our forum-posting community, many of you probably do as well.<br />
<br />
A paladin can choose from among specs that let her be a tank, melee DPS or healer, and can shift around which role she fills in a raid or BG team from week to week. Through the Dual Spec feature, she can even do so within a single evening. If her group doesn’t need another healer, or if she needs a break from tanking, she can become a DPS spec fairly easily without having to swap to a different character. A warlock doesn’t have that luxury. Yet, the warlock still has three specs. Is the idea, then, that you are supposed to swap from Destruction to Demonology and back depending on the situation? Is the idea that you play Affliction if you like dots and Destruction if you like nukes? Or do you just switch to whatever theoretically does 1% more DPS for the next fight?<br />
<br />
Players are sometimes cavalier about throwing around the claim that there’s a “lack of design direction” when they want their character buffed. Of course, classes always have a design direction; players just sometimes disagree with it. My point is that just because we debate whether the current design is the best possible one doesn’t mean there isn’t a design at all. That distinction is important. And of course, we do have a directive for which DPS spec you should play: whichever one you enjoy the most. But that doesn’t mean that is the best model or that it can’t ever change. There are other models we could try.<br />
<br />
Model One – Everyone is equal all the time<br />
If your DPS and utility are the same across specs, then you just play whichever one you prefer. Maybe you like the kit of the Frost mage, or maybe you like the rotation of the Fury warrior, so you play them. As I said above, this has been the model we have used for a while now, with mixed success. The challenge is that “all the time” caveat. We can get all of the DPS specs pretty close together on target dummies, and indeed they actually are very close on target dummies today. Our encounters aren’t target dummies though. Having some adds increases the damage of dot-specs. Having lots of adds increases the damage of strong AE specs. Having to move on a fight, and how often and far you have to move, can cause DPS to go up or down differently. Even if DPS is only off by a few percentage points, many players will respec to the one with the highest DPS (even if it’s theoretical, even if for them they will do lower personal DPS than if they had stuck with a more familiar spec). A mage who just loves Fire might be frustrated if he ever has to go Arcane, while another player might be happy that he gets to try different specs for different fights.<br />
<br />
The class stacking we’ve seen on the Spine of Deathwing encounter relates to the need for massive burst damage in a specific window, such that the difference between a one minute DPS cooldown and a two minute DPS cooldown matters. Even if we could make sure every spec had the same AE vs. single target damage, do we now need to also ensure every spec can do the same DPS in burst windows of various lengths? Is that even mathematically possible? Or do we just test every spec for every raid encounter of the current tier and tweak class mechanics around for whatever is the current status quo? That implies a high rate of change, and I wonder if we’d lose a little bit of the fun of experimentation and theorycrafting if it was basically accepted that you could take any spec to any fight and do about the same damage. It’s more balanced, yes, but does it lack depth or flavor? Is it fun?<br />
<br />
Model Two – Everyone has specialties and you match the spec to the situation<br />
Under this model, we would establish spec specialties. For example, Arcane could be good for single-target fights while Fire is great at AE fights. Some of that design already exists in the game, but we try not to overdo it. If you really like playing one mage spec, or really detest constant spec swapping, then this model isn’t going to be to your liking. Furthermore, we don’t want to overstrain our boss design by having to meet a certain quota of AE vs. single target fights and movement vs. stationary fights and burn phase vs. longevity fights or whatever. It is also really hard to engineer these situations in Arenas or Battlegrounds (for example, both mobility and burst are extremely desirable in PvP), so in those scenarios there still may just be one acceptable spec.<br />
<br />
Model Three – You swap specs to gain specific utility<br />
If we used this model, then you might switch out to a different spec to gain a specific spell. Again, we have some of this today. A DK might want Unholy’s Anti-Magic Zone for a certain fight. Hunters might go Beastmaster to pick up a missing raid buff. Mages might go Fire for situations where Combustion shines. Druids might go Balance when they need the knockback from Typhoon. A little of this sort of thing goes a long way though. As in Model One, not every player wants to have to swap specs. If you just like Survival, you might resent having to go BM to just to buff someone. If knockbacks are too potent, then it really constrains your raid composition and makes even casual guilds feel like they need to keep a stable of alts or benched players for every fight. If, for example, there wasn’t a boss in the current raid tier for which warrior abilities really shine, then warriors start to feel like a third wheel, yet trying to make sure every boss in a tier has a moment for every spec to shine is a pretty daunting task.<br />
<br />
The extreme case of this is the “utility” spec who does middling DPS, but brings a lot of synergy and utility that improves all of the other specs. This was the Burning Crusade model, where classes like shaman and Shadow priests were brought to raids just to make the pure classes (and warriors, who were always treated as pure classes back then for some reason) do better DPS. In Lich King, we changed the design to make different raid buffs and abilities more widespread and give groups much more flexibility in their raid (and to some extent dungeon) comps. We heard from Shadow priests that they wanted to do competitive damage, not just be there to make everyone else more awesome. But even today we get a lot of requests to improve the utility of someone’s spec so that they are more likely to get invited to a group.<br />
<br />
Model Four – There is just a best spec for PvP and PvE<br />
This was the model of vanilla World of Warcraft, and we understand some players wouldn’t mind it returning. In this model Arms and Frost and Subtlety (and other specs) were designed to be good for PvP, while others, Fury and Fire and Combat perhaps, were designed to be good for PvE. The PvP specs might have better mobility or survivability or burst damage, while the PvE specs have better sustained damage over the course of a 6-10 minute boss fight. A lot has changed since vanilla. We don’t make many raid or dungeon encounters these days where DPS specs can just stand in one place and burn down a boss. Mobility, survivability, and burst damage can all be really useful on particular encounters, sometimes trumping the higher DPS offered by a competing spec. (There’s that old adage that dead do zero DPS.) In addition, if there is a PvP spec and a PvE spec, then for pure classes that implies that your third spec lacks much of a role. (The good leveling spec? Is that exciting?) Furthermore, our Mists of Pandaria talent tree design explicitly takes away some of the tools from the traditional PvP specs and makes them available to other specs in the class. If this works out, then you can take your Frost mage raiding, or have an Arcane mage for PvP who uses some of what traditionally were Frost’s control and escape tools. That’s great if you PvP and love Arcane, or PvE and love Frost. It’s less cool if you were the kind of player who was totally comfortable with the simpler (and possibly easier to balance) design of having dedicated PvP vs. PvE specs.<br />
<br />
Model Five – Don’t have multiple DPS roles<br />
This is the most controversial model and the one that would require the most change, meaning we are almost certainly never going to do it. For sake of completeness though, you can argue that classes never should have been designed with multiple specs that fill the same role. In this model, either Arms or Fury goes away and gets replaced with something. (Archery? Healing?) Warlocks and other pure classes would need a massive redo to end up with say a melee and tanking warlock. Everyone becomes a hybrid. The hardest decisions becomes whether you want to be the ranged or melee DPS version of your class (like druids or shaman). This idea is elegant from a design perspective because it un-asks all of those questions about how much more damage pure classes should do than hybrids to justify their narrower utility. But, perhaps counter-intuitively, elegant designs often aren’t the strongest ones (I could write a whole blog on that topic alone). Model Five is the kind of rhetorical question you could go back in time and ask before WoW launched, but not the kind of thing we could change today without taking an enormous amount of effort, to say nothing of the irate players who would feel bamboozled that we were so dramatically changing their character out from under them. I try to never say never, but this model isn’t the kind of change you make in a mature game. It’s here only for completeness and because I suspect some of you will bring it up.<br />
<br />
But Which is the Best Model?<br />
Hell if I know! I fundamentally believe that none of these models is, without question, the obvious right one. All of them have advantages and disadvantages, and there are probably other models you could come up with that are variants on these five, or perhaps even something new. Like I said, we’re not announcing a philosophy change yet. If we get enough feedback for one model or another, we might eventually change our minds. Also for this blog we’re going to lock the comments and ask that you post your replies in this forum thread. Just remember that even we don’t believe that there is one correct answer, so please keep that in mind when you’re composing your feedback.<br />

&quot;I'm very pleased GC brought model 4 up. The concept, like GC said, was much acceptable in Vanilla. Also, back then we were looking at how to improve our dps with gear and not by spec (atleast I did). I think that's the way you have to go. Make certain gear hard to obtain (make epic, epic again). I think that the dps output should be gear dependent and not spec dependent.the specs in between can have slight dps differences, but when you keep obtaining stronger gear, your dps should increase by a fair amount and the spec you have should have less to none impact.at least this is what I have understood by playing runescape in the past =/&quot;make epics, epics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well maybe not.. but why can't every class be able to fill two roles just based on how they spec?<br />
<br />
Why couldn't a BM hunter tank for instance? Or a Demo lock? As well as &quot;traditional&quot; tank class. Maybe using the pet but still it could. Many a times in BC raids you needed to use a ranged tank for bosses. <br />
<br />
Shaman -- Dps/Heal why couldn't they tank too?<br />
Rogue -- Dps and either tank or heal maybe bard healing tree?<br />
Hunter -- Tank as BM<br />
Warlock -- Tank as Demo<br />
Mage -- Tank as frost? Heal maybe a stretch <br />
<br />
Just a weird idea....</div></div><hr />

Ret are unique in that they have one of each and so all must be viable. So lets look at range hybrids.. spriest, balance, ele. looking at dps logs for every fight, spriest and balance are much higher in dps than ele in pretty much all fights, at least on average. Lets remember that these logs all use legendary weapons, and that the average hybrid is usually last in line for one, since they often need to respec to healing etc and so the legendary was given to mages/locks, a hybrid in an average guild/pug does not have one. This means that in reality, ele dps is much lower for the average ele. Adding to that is a poor performing enhance spec, and without doubt the worst resto spec of all the classes on the majority of fights and you have a shaman that are only useful for any buffs they provide (10m).</div></div><hr />

Every spec should be tuned to an almost identical output under a certain benchmark (say a target dummy or a more complex simulation). <br />
Every spec thus performs the same, but does so differently.And so what if certain specs perform better in specific situations?<br />
As long as other specs have their moments of glory I don't see a problem.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that Shamans were originally designed to be a hybrid tank class right? Stoneclaw Totem, Rockbiter weapon and defense on Mail gear.

It's not Moses coming down from the mountain to proclaim to the people the words of God from stone tablets. It's a window into the thoughts and discussions the design team have about the direction of the game and their objectives with each gameplay element. You know, like a watercooler discussion? The whole point is he's talking about possibilities and thoughts rather than laying down a final direction that they've decided on.<br />
<br />
As such it's a valuable insight, I always find them very interesting. It also shows that they think about these issues that are a big part of quality of life for us players, and when you read them you realise they're considering solutions to this, from the minor to the dramatic. So when they make big announcements like the talent revamp and so on that are so controversial, you can follow their reasoning and see WHY they think it's necessary (and agree or disagree/rage up the forums/QQ like crazy as is your wont).<br />
<br />
I thought it was a well thought-out discussion of an issue that I've thought of as well while playing the game, and I'm sure a lot of other players have too. It's especially highlighted with SWTOR coming out with a highly hybridised class makeup, and all the relevant pros and cons.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadzta</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i went to post my 2 cents on the official forums but because I'm no longer a subscriber i can't post on their forums. That in itself is bullshit in my opinion. I understand its to stop trolls etc etc. However surely there is a way to distinguish between how long someone has been unsubscribed or how their forum account is in good standing or something to allow those still interested in the game but don't want to sub back just to post -_-.<br />
<br />
Anyway personally I'm really sincerely feeling number 5. Even if we have to limit down some specs etc. So warriors melee dps tank and thats it. Hell I'm sure you could give warriors a ranged berserker spec. Kinda like troll warlord from back in Dota. Throwing axe or something similar. Long story short i believe we are in a stage where the conventional MMO design is stale. Needs to be shaken up. It almost feels like change with the times or die. Soon there will be a game that gets it &quot;right&quot; . As in is far better than anything else on the market but obviously still with inherent flaws from varying opinions. SW:TOR made its mark. While it failed in a lot of ways it did some good. Personally I'm finger crossing that we'll see Guild Wars 2 really dent the MMO populace. WoW has to adapt or die.</div></div><hr />

It makes balancing work well in pvp, and pve by reducing the number of specs in both. As he mentions multiple specs of the same role does not work well in pve due to the fact that 1 will always be better, even if by a little bit, and players will flock to it, making the other one well pointless. In PvP they have shown they dont have the brain power or the talent or the desire to balance all the specs for it, so going back to a 10 spec system will greatly ease balancing to the point that maybe they can do it, especially if they fire GC so they can balance mages and rogues.The only problem with model 4 is pures having a &quot;useless&quot; spec. Well the truth is that spec is useless now anyway. For pures maybe give them 1 pvp spec and 2 pve, with one pve spec aimed more for aoe and one for single target, and they dual spec switch it mid instance depending on the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvE/PvP<br />
<br />
For certain classes in particular (Eg/ Ret paladins, hybrids and so on), they have to carry the burden of having only one spec for each task, which means inevitably having to sacrifice some talent points that some other classes might get to use for beneficial spells/effects in PvE, for PvP effects purely because they have no other choice (Eg/ Sacred Shield being on all Ret Paladin builds despite being a skill that should never even have to be procced if all goes well in PvE). <br />
<br />
On the same token, pure classes have suffered greatly due to the homogenisation; it used to be the case that Hybrids could do every job okay, and pures (namely/only dps for that matter), did their job best, because it's the only job they had. What complicates this now is things like LFD/LFR and so on, where hybrids can do just as good if not better than pure DPS (Warlocks being morbidly clunky/difficult at the moment to name but one example), as well as having access to other much more beneficial roles (Tanks/healers always being in demand, getting instant queues etc), which is a luxury that pure DPS do not have. Blizzard said their idea for Cata was to &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot;, and yet it remained the case of &quot;bring the class, not the player&quot;, which to be frank is something I don't think they'll escape. I would personally see their homogenisation efforts scrapped in favour of making classes unique/special again, but whatever I think, they're going to need to find a solution. Seperate PvE/PvP talent trees would be a very easy fix in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

However, as GC pointed out in model four... if you DO make a &quot;best&quot; PvP and &quot;best&quot; PvE spec, what is the third spec for pure classes? A flavor spec? Is it to talent trees what Engineering is to professions... developers give it some love and attention at the beginning of any given expansion but just forget about it? Is it the &quot;trap spec&quot; that looks appealing but ultimately does nothing but gimp your performance? While many people here might like the notion of a trap spec that helps them identify new players so they can slaughter them more easily, it's likely not in the designer's best interest to do design one spec to be completely ignored. Or do they just eliminate the third spec?<br />
<br />
At the same time, many players don't want to feel pigeonholed into &quot;this is your spec, use it or you fail.&quot; Does that require no consideration?</div></div><hr />

you are reading into his statement what you want to based on your own bias. He said they don't have MANY raids with burn bosses not they don't have ANY. I'm pretty sure you cant just stand there and DPS all the fights in DS. Ultraxion is the only real stand still and smash buttons boss. <br />
<br />
In Cata, here are the stand still and burn bosses<br />
<br />
DS: Ultraxion<br />
FL: none, although Baleroc is close but you still have to move a little to do crystal phases and on heroic everyone has to move around.<br />
BWD: none, You can stack for parts of some fights, Chimeron is close to a burn boss but not quite and Magmaw has burn phases but you do have other things to do. Same with Maloriak. None of the fights have you standing in one spot burning for the entire fight.<br />
BOT: None, some bosses have burn phases but no standing still for the whole fight<br />
TOFW: None. lots of movement on all fights.<br />
<br />
Lets look at Wrath:<br />
<br />
NAX: Patchwerk<br />
Maly: None<br />
Ruby: None<br />
Ulduar: None, a little stacking on ignis and razor but still have other roles to perform so cant just stand there and DPS<br />
TOC: None<br />
ICC: None, quite a few burn phases on some bosses but no stand there and dps bosses<br />
Ruby: None<br />
<br />
I'd keep going back in expansions but I think you get the idea.</div></div><hr />

80% might be overstating it, but several of the old fights required much less movement than fights currently... and when they did, they more often than not either required a select few people to move or a simple &quot;run to spot X and continue DPSing while standing still.&quot; Very few fights of yore required anything resembling Alysrazor or conclave levels of movement.</div></div><hr />

Blizz is doing Model 1 + Model 5 to the game, slowly but surely. Take away abilities, make everyone have everything, but just a generic version or name change of it. Eventually there are only 3 classes in the game, tank, dps heal. Then...healing will be automatic (ahem monks?) and there will only be Dps and Tanking.

Have Arcane better for standstill single target fights while frost/fire is great on the aoe and control.Warlock - remove destro and have affliction (maybe increase afflictions burst to compensate). Turn demo into more of a melee lock class (allow it to be at range but increase shadowflame to be more important and perhaps alter incinerate to being a shorter range.Hunter - Remove BM so their pets aren't quite so important, and lead MM to be single-target while Survival has superior aoe.Rogue - remove sub entirely. Turn ass into single target and have Combat aoe (change blade flurry so it's 20% but all targets in range or some such)Definitely a lot of work, but ultimately now's the best time to address pure dps classes having to sim every new patch which spec to use.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree with this, I've felt that way for a while now.<br />
<br />
Edit; In my opinion. Moral is they'll chose which ever option requires the least amount of time to fix. Reason being is because as they've already proven. What ever the player wants. &quot;costs to many resources&quot;. I personally really like the idea of pvp being separated by PVE I think that would be a great way to start, but as they've said... that's to difficult for them to do. And I also like the idea of hybrids. Thats what I liked about swtor, you pick your class.. you pick your advance class and you're stuck with it. If they made everyone hybrids the game would ultimately be boring. Why? Because if everyone can do everything.. whats the point. Thats the exact reason I hate gc's direction of &quot;everything/something for everyone&quot; Because it destroy's peoples drive to play.</div></div><hr />

&quot;I'm very pleased GC brought model 4 up. The concept, like GC said, was much acceptable in Vanilla. Also, back then we were looking at how to improve our dps with gear and not by spec (atleast I did). I think that's the way you have to go. Make certain gear hard to obtain (make epic, epic again). I think that the dps output should be gear dependent and not spec dependent.the specs in between can have slight dps differences, but when you keep obtaining stronger gear, your dps should increase by a fair amount and the spec you have should have less to none impact.at least this is what I have understood by playing runescape in the past =/&quot;make epics, epics.<br />
<br />
So basically, revert the game back to Vanilla 100% and kill wow entirely? Don't know where you have been the last year or so since Cata launched but uh, even a hint in that direction lost them a chunk of subs and the further they go with &quot;Hardcore Epic&quot; model loses even more.

How much more do they need to loose until people like you wake up and realise that you have rose colored nostalgie glasses on your nose if it comes to vanilla WoW. Vanilla was time consuming and boring for the most of the time but we had nothing else so we leveled our alts and hoped that &quot;Molten Bore&quot; would end and people without a BWL raid hoped to get some content. If you would reverse the game to that time so many subscribers would be lost that for the first time you could declare WoW &quot;dead&quot;. You can't turn back the clock, you will never ever have the vanilla feeling. Just like you can't have a second youth or first-love.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paladins, priests, shaman, druids, warriors &amp; death knights can already do this (granted a few of the specs belonging to those classes are badly designed compared to other in game)<br />
<br />
That leaves warlocks, mages, rogues &amp; hunters without a second role.<br />
<br />
As for what those roles could be.<br />
<br />
Warlocks could take on a demon form to tank, or possibly use affliction to drain health from enemies to heal allies.<br />
<br />
Hunters could use their pets to tank.<br />
<br />
Rogues could be avoidance tanks like they were occasionally used for in vanilla &amp; TBC. <br />
<br />
Mages could use arcane energy to shield allies &amp; restore their health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly it is unlikely that class balance &amp; design will get much better then it is currently. In fact it may get worse because of a new class being added, god knows PvP balance probably will. <br />
<br />

They do a moderate amount of dps (maybe as much as tanking), but bring such interesting mechanics to the group. Powerful, short cooldown buffs to ally's attacks, unique debuffs. Pures would finally have a place in groups, since all the hybrids now do competitive dps.1 tank 1 heal 2 dps and 1 more dps or support. 2 tanks 3 heals 4 dps, 1 support. Can't be just a buff. Gotta have a fun mechanic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jayremy</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say the problem is encounter designs and stems from the whole idea and concept all around and related to enrage timers being perceived as &quot;needed&quot; and healers potentially being able to heal non-stop or at least always keep up with damage and nobody else can get hit once or more than the tank.<br />
<br />
The roles seem in a sense to restricted, too narrow. It was funny when people were all having &quot;???&quot; their heads when they heard smite could heal for the first time in Cata. Realistically this is a minor openness of the game that should stayed existing. Instead enrage timers and &quot;DPS requirements' just get stricter. Somehow there is a huge amount of catering to the needed to make Raiding some weird form of PvP, while not having any actual PvP in it, which I doubt most people that actually play WoW care about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not say there needs to be casualness to the game in the terms of everything being easy but it should be less linear. Fights could be designed much different than now, where taking damage is more in the control of the player and much more challenging in terms of avoiding it. Instead of so much mandatory damage that happens, making mandatory healer, designing healers around being able to meet the mandatory requirements, it could all be avoidable and healers would be more limited and actually healing would be more of a choice (and perhaps trade some of the healing power with temporary buffers like some bard support role). Essentially healers are a support role at their routes, it would be nice if DPS had more concern than meters and tanks had more concern than having everything facing them, hitting them until they die.<br />
<br />
Whenever I tanked I found kiting and such more fun when I had to combine all sorts of stuff BESIDES my typical rotation that gets boring after being spammed 100+ times in a fight, in about 50+ fights a day; playing more unorthodox was a huge relief. This is a model many action combat RPGs have, that WoW can (and should have long ago) do regardless of the control difference: Encounters that would change how you would play greatly, certain attacks are shelved, rotations are changed maximizing output doesn't matter. the right focus in the end of it all should be a matter of &quot;we are alive, enemy is dead&quot; nothing else should really matter or be tested. It allows people to be more fun about what they do and not stress about the numbers but just play the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you think about it from a real life perspective, say boxing, you just don't keep swing non-stop bell to bell regardless of hits and misses, you time attacks, decide when to hit, what to avoid. You make judgement errors, and must emphasize on precision that can cost you or rely on the opponent to do it. Non-stop swinging would drain your strength, and also leave you exposed, so you needed pacing. If you think about it like any activity, its more fun when its done with a pacing and more organized faction not just a blitz till one side drops, because in the end if that is how all things went, it would just be predictable and repetitive.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinuviel</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Model 6: add a buff/support playstyle to the game and prioritise the currently triple DPS specc classes. <br />
<br />
Mage: <br />
Fire: pure dps <br />
Frost: more pvp focussed, could become dps or buff tree as well maybe <br />
Arcane: buff tree for example: arcane mage has tools to empower his allies, aid them in their roles. The trick is finding a good resource system for this. Mana may be fine, but you want to have a way to adjust the powerlevel of the buffs you hand out. (some sort of combo system, or the current Arc blast stacking). Possible buffs to be handed out would be Arcane shield (tank CD) or Arcane Wall (raid CD), Arcane infusion (DPS increase for ranged), Arcane might (DPS increase for melee) etc ... <br />
<br />
Rogue: not very familiar with the rogue trees so don't know which one would be more suited to fulfill a buff/enhance role. But as been said, the bard role is an option, I'm sure someone can further write out what this would do ;) <br />
<br />
Warlock: what if the Affliction tree would have skills &amp; spells that would allow the lock to 'afflict' or 'posess' his allies, improving what they do, but at a cost (HP) which the warlock himself would then have to compensate for in some way (Draining life to allies). <br />
Or perhaps use the Demonology tree to summon Demons that could be commanded to aid allies at key times. (a demon to assist the tank, kind of like the Palladin CD) or a demon that can be sent to a healer in need of mana &amp; more healing power It would be a lot more numbercrunching for Blizzard to make this work, and I'm not sure how balanced you can make it. But it would be something new (I'm sure it has been done this way before, but for WoW it would be newish) and possibly exciting if they can make it work.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archermit</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well maybe not.. but why can't every class be able to fill two roles just based on how they spec?<br />
<br />
Why couldn't a BM hunter tank for instance? Or a Demo lock? As well as &quot;traditional&quot; tank class. Maybe using the pet but still it could. Many a times in BC raids you needed to use a ranged tank for bosses. <br />
<br />
Shaman -- Dps/Heal why couldn't they tank too?<br />
Rogue -- Dps and either tank or heal maybe bard healing tree?<br />
Hunter -- Tank as BM<br />
Warlock -- Tank as Demo<br />
Mage -- Tank as frost? Heal maybe a stretch <br />
<br />
Just a weird idea....<br />
<br />
you say weird but why not, it would add a whole new dimension to the classes and allow those people that know their class well expand on that and do roles that before they needed alts for</div></div><hr />

Eitherway the guy is right, neither of the models are the best. The only way is to make encounters in a way where some specs might be better without giving a huge disadvantage to the other specs. Sure Priest has healing and dps spec's. Do i want a Melee spec instead of 2 healing spec's. O hell no, if i want a melee healer i would have rolled a paladin. The specs are fine as they are now, it gets better in MoP imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlock: Demonology as Tank (morphing into a demon, the utility is already there) - just as Druids turn into bears; possibly also Affliction als Healer with the &quot;life energy transfer&quot; model<br />
Mage: Arcane as Healer (it already has the most utility spells of the whole tree, why not turn it right into a support / healer spec?)<br />
Rogue: Turn the combat rogue into a tank, problem solved - dodge + parry and many survival CDs instead of hard damage<br />
Hunter: Here, I would also see a tank role, but possibly a healer too when the pet comes into play! Something similar to the concept of the healing monk<br />
<br />
Though I would miss the respective specs as DD (currently, I am enjoying the controllable burst of the Arcane Mage, the playstyle of the Combat Rogue and the Demonology Warlock), I could imagine adjusting to a hybrid role of these classes as well.

The fact is, that the game started in a way and you cannot change it radically without doing another new game. They surely would invest the energy in making a completely new project, am i right? They can only adjust things already present, MoP is an example - talent system changed, but the core mechanics are still there. The model that would work best is a Diablo/Skyrim look-a-like system: classes are distinct by the core stats they use and the abilities they can unlock; these abilities can be divided into macro-areas that are shared by some classes (like rogues and warriors can access at the &quot;imbameleestrike&quot; ability, but warriors can get &quot;smithing&quot; and go strenght, rogues can get &quot;evasion&quot; and go agility). The more are the talents/perks/whatever you call them, the better it is. The balance will occur due to the fact it will be very difficult to find the &quot;best spec&quot;, and even if someone finds it, there will be some way to counter it. Last thing, Blizzard has stated well that players are interested in &quot;meaningful choices&quot; - MoP talents are a step forward. But there are very few choices, and most of the things a clòass has is passive; but you cannot change this unfortunately without making WoW a completely different game - wasting time and energy.</div></div><hr />

Have a look at all of WoW, its all copied and then improved, its why Blizzard is successful, its what they do.<br />
Just look at examples throughout it, i mean really, WoW was not the first MMO, it copied the basic system from Guild Wars and improved it.<br />
It then copied things from other games aswell.</div></div><hr />

It's the same with DG/Knockback on Ragnaros heroic, even if that wasn't nearly as bad.<br />
<br />
Thats something I was having issues wording earlier, but well said. If they dont want class stacking on boss fights and what not, they should design the encouters better. They should stop with forcing you to have a, b, and c abilities making you stack classes x and y just to be able to beat something. They should take the classes into question when designing a boss fight instead of trying to shape the classes around each specific tier of raiding. <br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly what i have been saying for a while now.<br />
Also im sure alot of people are sweating atm waiting on them sub numbers to be made public, gotta love that pathetic thread thats going on in the other part of the forum that ended up after a few posts becoming a wow vs swtor battle.<br />
<br />
Honestly, im waiting for the sub numbers as well. But yeah i've realized most anytime you talk about one or the other it turns into a wow vs swtor battle. -_- If you like swtor and point out the flaws of wow or just what you enjoy in swtor more then you enjoy wow, you're a fanboy. If you point out what you dislike about swtor and what wow does better you're a troll/fanboy. -_- i dislike how people seem to find it impossible to get along with one another and just accept on game cannot be perfect for everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Reverting to Vanilla style is good idea though, because it will wipe out people like you who keep downgrading the quality of the game<br />
<br />
But also the mass majority of the people who pay their bills. <br />
<br />
<br />
I find it funny that many people are like &quot;GC has lost all direction and doesn't know what to do with the game&quot; He's not the only one developing it, and certainly doesn't make all the decisions. He could say &quot;Right guys, let's give warriors a 4th spec, a healing tree that when you hit stuff it heals all friendly targets around you&quot; do you think the entire team would get to work on that? Of course not.<br />
<br />
Because ghostcrawler is the lead system designer. Description of a system designer is as thus, &quot;System design is the creation of game rules and underlying mathematical patterns.&quot; GC Has been labeled the leader of the dev team for quite a while now. Hes the one who shows at blizzcon panel's, the one who gets the final word... etc. etc. etc. If he doesn't agree it doesn't happen. Meaning if they the dev team have no direction its because GC has no direction. Considering the dev team follows the leaders direction and makes it happen. No direction... means he, gc, doesn't have one. Plus he pretty much just admited he, as well as the rest of the team, have no idea what to do to fix class specs.<br />
<br />
<br />
They don't want players to invest time in the game and they wonder why the players stop playing :)<br />
<br />
Perfectly said. :P The whole thing &quot;something for everyone&quot; is a terrible idea. If everyone can get everything... then you have nothing to drive for. Same concept as using cheat codes in a game. once you cross that barrier you can get anything... nothing matters anymore.<br />

Going from best, to worst, and having to learn the new best.How would it lack depth? What your saying is that you would play the spec that does the most damage! There's zero depth when there's no real choice. When a DPS spec is the best of their class, people play it. If people play say frost mage, they don't get invites to good runs or even guilds. There's people that are dying to be able to play their favorite style and spec but having other specs do better prevent that. There's no depth in swapping specs because it got buffed during the patch, or because it's better on the next boss fight. I raid on my Mage that I wish so much that I could play frost, but the damage is just not there. I'm perfectly fine if the get rid of some of their stupid op cc/utility so they can keep up with damage as long as I can actually play the spec I like. Until then I'm stuck playing 2 specs that don't raise my interests at all. That's not depth.<br />

Another thing they need to do is make the game epic again like BC, all this everyone can kill everything kills the mood of the game. When I played BC before wrath patch I never did more then half of SSC, and i never stepped foot into TK and it made the game feel epic. Knowing there's strong stuff in the game that I couldn't get to yet gave me something to strive for. Sure there's heroic modes, but with raid finder and normal being so easy, when you experience killing the end boss you gain a mindset that the great evil was a pansy. I spent most of my time in Kara and once a month gruuls with a rare mag run thrown in, and it was my best time playing wow. Not to mention doing the BC attunements were exciting. The feeling that you were progressing through the story behind the raids kept you going.<br />

LFG and LFR as good as it is, is ruining the feel of the 'world' in world of warcraft. LFR / LFG are fine for finding people for a dungeon, but it should have never teleported you to the instance. I loved when there was so much travel time before to get to see the world of the game. It gave you the feeling that you were fighting your way to an evil lair. My favorite instance to run to was Maraudon even if I was currently in Stormwind. Its surprising now how so many people don't even know where the instances are anymore. Nothing was more exciting my first time trying to find a way to Darnassuss during vanilla as a noob lvl 12 Human Warrior. Someone from trade actually ran there by foot with me to show me the way from stormwind. Getting to see everything along the way had me so amazed by the game. As we traveled everything just got more gloomy and gloomier. When I got to the docks of Darkshore I had no idea what to expect, I thought I was in the heart of evil or something. Looking back now I cant believe someone actually did that without asking for a tip.</div></div><hr />

Part of the reason I ditched my mage after so long was 1) The specs didn't feel unique enough (all ranged, all centered around a primary nuke, all have a proc effect into a secondary nuke), and 2) I didn't like that I was pulled from Fire because Arcane was king a particular tier. If Mages had a healing spec I'd be heaven because I miss the utiltiy spells like poly, blink, teleports, ice block, etc on my healers. I like their reasoning behind the talent/spec changes in MoP. The early calculator looked very promising imo. Can't wait for the deluge of MoP info!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessarily a bad idea, but maybe a little bit one-sided or boxed in when it comes to class design.<br />
If one were to expand to the &quot;full&quot; set of 6 roles again (Tank, Healer, CC, Buffer, Debuffer, Damage), it'd be easy to give everyone 3 of those roles so no one has 2 trees with the same role. Could then maybe add a fourth PvP-specific spec which combines style and flow of the other specs in some PvP-centric way.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arclyte</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea that GC acknowledged that there are certain limitations in role design and function. It is definitely a daunting problem that can affect the way raids and boss fights function and its good to hear that Blizz is actively seeking creating ways to &quot;freshen up&quot; old systems. But rather than see an effort to redefine the way each role functions, I rather see an effort to expand the way each role is played. To explain:<br />
<br />
Tanking, DPS, and healing, at thier core, will always be the same. Tanks grab aggro and position the mob, DPS beats the hell out of it, and healers keep people alive. But what if instead of giving players new spells and abilities to do complete thier tasks in the same manner, Blizz restructured classes to give players the option to play the same role in a different manner? Or even have a primary and secondary &quot;focus&quot; in each tree.<br />
<br />
I'll explain using a paladin as an example:<br />
<br />
Paladin tanking, no matter what your gear or level, is the same. Sword and Shield melee attacks; stack mastery then work on dodge and parry. Get close to the boss, and swing away to build holy power then burn it up. I'll call this the Melee Tank Tree. Currently the main &quot;focus&quot; is to build aggro and secondarily do moderate DPS to help the raid. So in my example, in this tree the Paladin's non-tanking related spells would add to dps or buff dps for the group.<br />
<br />
But what if there was another way? What if there was another tanking tree based on Holy Power? A tree where instead of stacking mastery the Paladin stacks other stats like intelligance and haste, and his mitigation is based on holy shields and spells. Here, the paladin's primary &quot;focus&quot; is still building aggro, but does it in a different way. Because he needs different stats, he needs different armor, and maybe uses an off hand instead of a shield. I'll call this the Holy Tank Tree. in this example the paladin's secondary focus is not DPS but healing, so in this tree the paladin's non-tanking related spells add to healing or buff heals for the grp.<br />
<br />
Building classes in this manner would accomplish may different things. <br />
<br />
First, it varies the way a person plays a particular role. Maybe I like to tank but I don't always want to do it the same way everyone else does. Second, it makes each class role less &quot;cookie cutter&quot; ie. each Prot Pally is not going to be relegated to haveing a a sword and shield and using the same rotation. Third, it gives raids utility. If a particular boss fight lacks on DPS then I'd want the tank who can help boost dps. If the boss fight lacks in healing, then I'd want the tank that boosts heals.<br />
<br />
I think each class/role could be designed in such a manner. That would add some nice variation to traditional roles that have become stagnant.</div></div><hr />

I love my hunter, but our guild needs me to tank, so I play warrior in raids. If I could take on my hunter, problem solved. Even the debate of which spec, theorycrafting said BM didn't do as much dmg as the other specs, so I level that way, then have to learn what's up with Surv when I get to max lvl. I would like to see a world were spec defines role, but allows flexibility in that role. Even with teh new talent system, you could choose the DPS role for hunters, and give up personal DPS for improved pet DPS. Then switch to Tank mode, and switch talents for survibablity, giving up DPS to be a better tank. Another problem I have is, I don't like to be melee DPS. If I'm up close, I want to tank it. If I'm not tanking, I want to be far away. So I don't DPS on my warrior. I have two slightly different tanking builds. I wish the two DPS specs weren't melee, and the warrior could equip a gun (technically he has one equipped already) and go ranged DPS. As mentioned in the watercoold article.Good ideas, I just wish they'd listen to themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every spec should be tuned to an almost identical output under a certain benchmark (say a target dummy or a more complex simulation). <br />
Every spec thus performs the same, but does so differently.And so what if certain specs perform better in specific situations?<br />
As long as other specs have their moments of glory I don't see a problem.<br />
I have to agree. Too much thought went into this, and they included model 5. They know they'd never do it, and they know the community would orgasm if it happened. So why even mention it? It'll just blow up in their face in 5.0 or 6.0 when everyone realizes Blizz meant it when they said they'd never do option 5.</div></div><hr />

For example, demo warlocks could be a tank spec with a permanent metamorphosis, arcane could be a healing spec that relied on shields much like disc, sublety could easily be a tanking spec, hunters could have a melee dps spec and possibly a tank spec, dks could have unholy become a range dps spec using spell plate, warriors could have a range spec, etc. It won't happen for obvious reasons, but I think it would improve the game.</div></div><hr />

For example a rogue could become a tank and a healer, best part of this is coming up with the names to fit the class when it changes it's role. Let's face it in most games that have some sort of dungeons the tanks followed by healers are always at a shortage. This is what makes the druid and paladin so unique, as they can switch between 3 specs and fill *all* roles. Sadly they are the only two classes in WoW that can do it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">blackwater</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is about the philosophy of the tri-spec.<br />
<br />
In wow's pve there are only 3 roles, DPS, TANK, HEAL.Some classes have the ability to at least do 2 completely different roles, for example a priest or a shaman can heal or dps, or a warrior can tank or dps, a paladin/druid maybe unfairly has all 3 choices, but that diversity makes them exciting to play. <br />
<br />
Several classes only have one choice, DPS, the argument is that is a boring choice and usually based on pure numbers. <br />
<br />
THE SOLUTION.<br />
The only real solution is to add another ROLE, one that is already in the game but mostly ignored, CC. ( for pve only!) <br />
<br />
Giving the DPS classes that have no alternative specs besides DPS an important Crowd Control role!(mages, hunters, locks, rogues) <br />
<br />
This gives them the benefit of being important in a fights outcome.<br />
Gives them an alternative exciting choice when they get bored of DPS.<br />
Makes pve harder and more challenging, without a good cc'r you die (just like not having a good healer or tank).<br />
Makes game encounters way more interesting.<br />
Make this not viable in pvp</div></div><hr />

There are times when I feel that the game suffers from having too many classes, simply because the number available makes each class less flexible in overall scope. The easiest one to visualize is combining rogue and hunter. There'd be some slight pruning needed, but you could have a very potentially complex class at the end.<br />
<br />
Same with mage / lock, priest / paladin, etc.</div></div><hr />

The hunter and pet can have cool combos they perform together and the hunter can have an ability similar to holy priests Holy Word, but instead of that ability changing by chakra it changes depending on the class of pet summoned.I think of the game in 4 roles, not 3. Tank, healer, ranged dps, melee dps. Just being able to switch from ranged to melee every now and again I believe would make alot of the pure dps specs happier.</div></div><hr />

Priest = Disc. gets more reliant on absorbs and Atonement-style damage-to-healing mechanics, with a little direct healing thrown in.<br />
Warrior = Arms more focused on Support perhaps? Throwdown, Intervene (no shield required, usable more often) for damage prevention.<br />
Shaman = Melee and ranged DPS are different enough to not require a change, but an Earth element based tanking spec would be very interesting.<br />
DK = Unholy becomes more Undead minion focused, give more ranged options, with melee thrown in.<br />
<br />
Pure classes would need a larger change.<br />
<br />
Hunter = Beast. would be more pet/melee focused. Give them a second pet. The hunter would still be ranged though.<br />
Warlock = Demo could become a Tanking class, or just make them more Pet-focused.<br />
Rogue = I wouldn't want a Dodge tank, but no other ideas. They are the one class that I can't get into playing.<br />
Mage = Make Frost more Support-focused. Able to cast an Icy Shield on players, or a AMZ/PW: Barrier targetable damage prevention.</div></div><hr />

It not make sense that some classes are severely hurt in term of DPS because of a specific raid design.</div></div><hr />

The last few years of patch notes. Perhaps you can brush up on your reading comprehension skills and see I made no claims that this ABSOLUTELY CONFIRMED 100%. It's theory based off what has happened in the past, and what is continuing to happen. Have you not seen the massive amount of homogenization that has occurred since LK ? Since BC ? (Who am I kidding, you probably never even set foot in BC areas let alone played during those days).</div></div><hr />

Hell remember the QQ when they decided DKs would only have one tanking tree? Multiply that by 30.<br />
<br />
It's elegant from a gameplay perspective, but it also makes elements of the game kind of absurd. Rogue tanks? Warlock healers? I mean, that's silly.<br />
<br />
Also, people seem to be suggesting making every DPS class able to tank, probably because this seems less of a stretch than making Hunter and Rogue healers. Bear in mind that tank slots are quite limited in the game - 2 per 10m raid and STILL ONLY 2 per 25m raid (Blizzard hasn't made a true 3-tank fight in a long time now). Hell a lot of fights can be 1-tanked. Being able to spec tank really wouldn't help a lot, in my experience the game desperately needs more healers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i don't actually have a priest but i believe that's how it should be. i don't care how good of a - for argument's sake - rogue i am. if the fight they're going into doesn't require what my class can do, i should be left out. end of story. other wise there is NO POINT in having classes</div></div><hr />

Rogue tanks? Warlock healers? I mean, that's silly. Silly ? It sounds awesome for me. I like wow how it is now (even if I only play &quot;hybrids&quot;, can't stand with a class locked in one role.) but I would LOVE if some roles were added to few classes.<br />
What if frost mage was instead water spec with some dps/healing spells (less damage than a SP but more healing).<br />
If subtetly was a tanking spec ? (a rogue melting in shadow to avoid damage and using trickery to lure his opponents)<br />
If survival hunter was meant to help their teammates to survive ? (healing/shielding)<br />
If the job of demolocks was to summon and control greater demons threatening every of his master's opponents (tanking)<br />
<br />
Adding variety to a game can't be wrong imo. Of course theses change are not realistic, it's too late. But I really would have enjoyed these options.</div></div><hr />

To develop a healing or tanking role for every single class, create spells, glyphs, and talent trees, AND THEN balance them all to eachother, and then balance them all in PvP? I'd wager that's a bit more than a &quot;few weeks' endeavor.&quot; <br />
<br />
And then the loot tables, oh, the loot tables. Welcome in tanking cloth gear and mail gear. Do we have ranged DPS plate? Strength offhand frills? It sucks enough seeing Healadin gear drop as it is.</div></div><hr />

That' absolutly not a problem. It's not because blizzard poorly maintained tanking plate that it should be the same for all class. Druid tank use dps gear, monk tank will too. You can easily translate that for other class.<br />
<br />
I first thaught that it would be massive work. But they have done that kind of work with blood DK actually, creating a tank spec and destroying a dps one in the same time. I don't think that the community would accept that mage/warlock/rogue/hunter sundenly becoming hybrids but it may be possible (i don't say that it will happen).</div></div><hr />

It was there because PVP &amp; PVE specs were clearly defined and understood though Vanilla and most of BC. It's mostly that way now, ie you spec Arms, Subtlety, Frost etc, if you want to be serious about PVP...and you don't spec those trees if you are serious about PVE, it's just that Blizzard won't come right out and say it.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but DKs already had a sound foundation to build tanking upon (all the basic abilities were already there, or were part of the frost tree.) Building a rogue tanking spec? Probably a litter harder than just switching some of the talent tree abilities around. And then imagine doing that for melee or tanking priests, warlock healers, etc, etc. And then tuning them all to perform equally well at those rolls as all the OTHER new class specializations and the ones that have been doing it for years.<br />
<br />
As for the gear, do DKs, warriors, and paladins ultimately get the screw over then? That they have to maintain completely separate sets of gear, while the rogue can slip from tanking into DPS with the same exact set of gear then? Does the warlock healer heal through the conventional use of spirit, or do they need to focus on damaging enemies to heal others? Do they use the same weapons as a DPS spec? And then answer that question for every new class specialization.<br />
<br />
I reiterate my previous statement: <br />
<br />
I'd wager that's a bit more than a &quot;few weeks' endeavor.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I never said that every class should have every role, that may be a far too overwhelming change. I just dreamed about pure class not being pure anymore, to break the &quot;purz R so skrewd actuly&quot; and to give some new possibilites.<br />
<br />
<br />

Have you ever played a feral tank ? Even if they have the same gear, the orientation is different. You can dps in bear spec with bear gear but it won't be optimal (ok, you will do better than a war/pal in tanking gear but still underperforming a real dps player).<br />
And that can &quot;easily&quot; be avoided by simply suppressing armor specific (plate/leather/mail/cloth) tanking gear. Let only neck/back/ring/trinket/weapons be purely tanking gear (you can even reintroduce attack power for these specific items to not mess with str/agi).<br />
<br />
It needs clearly some work. But imo it is not out of mind. Blizzard should get out the lazy path a bit more I think. Such changes could really refresh the game way more than simply &quot;hardening specs, opening template&quot; (still imo).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oldbugga</div><div class="date">2012-02-11, 04:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For such a fundamental part of the game's future development I am sure Blizz have a preferred model. I fear that GC's moment of &quot;openness&quot; is nothing more than a test of the waters to see where the turbulence will appear. This game has never, nor never will be, designed by some sort of democratic popularity pole so I doubt our input will change their preferred approach.<br />
<br />
Personally I think they are focusing too narrowly on class specs only but they can tighten the specs by providing utility in other ways like expanding the utility in the professions eg miners can leave potholes in the battlefield as a slow, or blacksmiths can scatter tacks as a slow, or jewelcrafters can blind with a crystal mirror as a stun or engineers can develop a TASER as a stun etc etc etc....endless possibilities which can be chosen by all players (despite their class) who chose the profession.<br />
<br />
In essence I believe that, because the issue of class design is so fundamental to the game's design, this blog is only to give us the impression we are being consulted....I believe they already have chosen their preferred approach.</div></div><hr />
