Patch 3.0.8 is behind us and the next one deployed on PTRs should be the content patch introducing Ulduar and Tier 8 sets (along with a few other things). I already posted these sets a few weeks ago but a lot of people requested screenshots of multiple races, I'm also posting new screenshots because a video will probably be posted very shortly. (Yeah, seriously, the rogue set actually looks really good in game) <br />
<br />
All races are available for each class, even if they can't pick this class in game. It didn't take a lot more time to do it for all of them and I figured it could be interesting to see how it looks. <br />
Only Death Knight, Hunter, Rogue, Priest, Mages, and Warlock sets are available. Don't bother asking for the others they're just not in the game files.<br />
Male version of the rogue set isn't fully implemented in the game files, undead females are missing as well.<br />
Dwarves aren't on mage screenshots because I didn't have the time to fix a bug with them. It's not that important I guess because dwarves can't be mages.<br />

Lunar Festival - Finding Elders require you to complete the Wrath Gate quest line<br />
This is the most likely culprit. If you've yet to complete the Wrathgate questline all the way through Battle for the Undercity then you'll find certain portions of the old world phased, and the elders do not appear in those phases.<br />
<br />
Complete the Wrathgate questline and all should appear correctly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14657045704-lunar-festival.html))<br />
<br />
Bring the player, not the class<br />
We didn't want players to feel like they had to exclude other players that they wanted to bring based on the need to min/max certain buffs per group.<br />
<br />
Example: In the Sunwell era, in order to bring all of the +dps buffs you needed for a group of rogues, you ran out of space to bring say the Ret pally and possibly even the rogues.<br />
<br />
If you need 5 healers for LK content, you are better off bringing a diversity of healers because you gain different kinds of buffs and utility spells and their abilities mesh together well. But if you can't do that and want to bring 3 druids and 2 paladins or 5 priests, you can still manage the content with just a couple of exceptions (like Razuvious).<br />
<br />
The tanks tank in different ways, and as you have probably noticed, they feel pretty different to heal. Tanks are necessarily more homogenized than healers though because you might only have 2-3 of them in your group. Even so, there are encounters where a druid has a tanking advantage over a Protection paladin, just like there are situations where a Holy paladin has an advantage over a shaman. But they can all still get the job done at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
In Sunwell, you had one possible answer to &quot;Who should bring the Curse of Elements debuff?&quot; or &quot;Which class should we bring for mana regen?&quot; That is what we want to get away from.

It's just complete bs. You are required to bring at least 2 priests because you need to MC mobs and my server has a huge lack of priests.<br />

<br />
No, the reason for that is so the developers can use the models for NPC's and not look just like players, cause that would be confusing to some and really boring visually. Also they use the different colors for Arena versions of the gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you see the second REAL set of eyes? The top part of the head is supposed to be a decoy head, something to 'scare' people as someone once said. Supposedly it's some samurai stuff, the real eyes are in the giant gap at the bottom of the mask.<br />

I think it's pretty cool and one of the more creative sets they've done.</div></div><hr />

Tanks are necessarily more homogenized than healers though because you might only have 2-3 of them in your group. Even so, there are encounters where a druid has a tanking advantage over a Protection paladin, just like there are situations where a Holy paladin has an advantage over a shaman. But they can all still get the job done at the end of the day.<br />

If you got collectors edition of Wrath of the Lich King then look at the artwork book, start from the back and slowly flip towards the front. You will find a priest model, the helm there looks pretty cool.<br />
<br />
IMO the death knight set looks almost exactly the same as T7 instead of spikes pointing up in the air they point towards the ground...<br />
<br />
I don't know how much the developers or whoever is in charge of bringing new and exciting gear and that into the game get paid for designing this stuff but i meen come on guys where is your creativity, the WOW community was expecting something new and exciting for T8 after looking at T3 all over again.<br />
<br />
I know there is probably nothing that can be done about T8 now but please for T9 put in late nights and design something for us that is going to be so mind blowing, so unbelievably sik looking gear, weapons everything that is going to make us go. I AM GOING TO RAID!!! I AM GOING TO PUT IN THE LONG HOURS TO GET THIS AWESOME GEAR!!! <br />

Warlock: Odd, it reminds me of Druids, of The raven (Poem by edgar A poe) and a really sinister warlocky gig. I can't really decide this.<br />

In other news however, the bit about needing to complete the wrathgate quest line to get the northrend elders is false. I found all northrend elders yesterday (besides the dungeon ones) and I have not even started that chain.<br />
Although perhaps that is the key, maybe if you are partway through the chain it triggers the phasing so you can't find the elder, an all or nothing sort of deal.</div></div><hr />

These spoiler wings on my shoulder and head are getting stupid. We are the &quot;ricer&quot; class all we need now is the ability to drift our mounts in dalaran.<br />

But knowing my luck it will be disco balls on each shoulder and a laser light on my head.</div></div><hr />

The more I look at the rogue set, the more I think it may be the best in the game, at least the best rogue set ever. I'm trying to think of the best sets ever, and I keep coming up with t2 and t5 sets although I liked mage and warrior t3. What I am getting to is this-t8 looks like it may be the most consistent since t2, which imo had the best overall feel including Bloodfang, Nemesis and Judgement.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kuismar</div><div class="date">2009-01-27, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I would like to see them finally do for once is make the Tier sets colors/styles based on the spec sets. So for example if you are a shadow priest your T8 would be the red, your T8.5 would be the Purple, and then your holy T8 would be the blue, and T8.5 would be the White.<br />
<br />
While of course this works with almost evey class, some like Hunters, Mages, Rogues that only have one set would be able to choose one of the two colors, or hey maybe one day they will actually itemize hunter sets properly based on spec, for example haste + agi on SV, haste + int on MM, and armor pen + mp5 on BM. Similar could be said for the others I mentioned.</div></div><hr />

Now, I also wish I rolled a rogue. That set is incredibly sick looking. Aren't you rogues tired of the same old crap? That helm is cool as hell in game, and there's shoulder animations as well, Course the exception is if you chose one of the models with crappy body types (read gnome).</div></div><hr />

The top part of the head is supposed to be a decoy head, something to 'scare' people as someone once said. Supposedly it's some samurai stuff, the real eyes are in the giant gap at the bottom of the mask.<br />
<br />
I think it's pretty cool and one of the more creative sets they've done.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree..it's very creative...it fits the role of rogues very well.</div></div><hr />

This is the most likely culprit. If you've yet to complete the Wrathgate questline all the way through Battle for the Undercity then you'll find certain portions of the old world phased, and the elders do not appear in those phases.<br />
<br />
Complete the Wrathgate questline and all should appear correctly. (Source)<br />
<br />
Not true. <br />
<br />
I didn't do the Wrathgate questline on my druid and I could see all 4 elders. In fact, I've only completed about 23 quests in that entire zone.<br />

Maybe it's true for Horde, but it definitely isn't true for Alliance.</div></div><hr />

nono, he means. He probably started the quest chain like i did on my hunter, stopped before i did the battle for the undercity and now when i go to org, the place is empty as hell. only a mailbox and random npc's. so you need to finish that quest chain for shit to go back to normal.</div></div><hr />

Actually i'm the most excited about paladins and Warriors this time around : ) Now is when bliz can finally come back and make all the neat WC2/3 Themed armor that was missing since the alliance pvp plate set. With the argent crusade and ebon hand, along with all of arthas' forces and the Vykrul playing a role in new content, the plate armor can't be anything short of amazing. For ulduar i'm honestly hoping they use the original crystalforge: <br />

I agree, neat look and one of the more creative things they have tried recently. Unlike a lot of recent gear it doesn't look mostly recycled. I like it.</div></div><hr />

this would be an awesome set. but as they have done with pali sets in the past they just haven't been able to top the T2 look.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see why people are complaining, it's something new from the &quot;hey, we'll just half ass with t7 and make it some shit no one was able to see&quot; idea. I personally like all of them that they have released and can't wait for the others.<br />
<br />
I've been staring at the male Belf Priest get-up for about 30 mins now. I swear, I'm gonna look like a badass, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm fine with them doing that, so long as the fix the issues these new boots create for Undead, Trolls, Tauren and the squids, it amazes me they were allowed into the release when theyre such an obvious error</div></div><hr />
