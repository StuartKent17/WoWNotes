<br />
a lot of the points on this list are plausible and would fit the current orientation of blizzard. beat 'em up seems a bit far-fetched, OW story game mode surely isn't a full-fledged mmo or SP/coop game experience, HotS seems okay and updated BC zones isn't impossible with this focus on blood elves.<br />
<br />

<br />
That leak is fake for sure. Simply because blizzard already mentioned the WoWpanel won't focus to much on 8.1 since everything about it has been announced. So 8.1 details makes 0 sense. They will most likely drop an 8.2 announcement and a small future glint.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, why would they rework dreanei and belf starting zones? Not even a reason given in the leak. Makes 0 sense.<br />
<br />
As for diablo, they won't remaster 2 on its own. It will surely be done with Diablo 1 aswel if ever done in the first place ( I do expect them to, but you never know)<br />
<br />
Overwatch story mode won't happen. Kerrigan skin won't go to D.va but Widowmaker instead if that one were to happen.<br />
<br />
I also doubt that hearthstone will get a streaming to blizzard social feature.<br />
<br />
To many things just make 0 sense, like you said it sounds like a wishlist and not a leak.</div></div><hr />

True. But it is also highly implausible that fucking nothing leaks beside the Amibo support for Diablo 3 that nobody cares about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think the &quot;leak&quot; is real, either, but there's plenty of reasons to rework those zones - to bring the areas into the main map, so you don't get a loading screen while going to them is a big one, and I think a lot of people would love to see Silvermoon City built for real, like Stormwind - and to update the zones with new art and shaders. Plus, there's a good chance warfronts might be located there. <br />
<br />
Server tech has evolved since TBC came out, they could bring the maps off dedicated shards and onto the main map, and free up resources for other things, like spawning battlefronts and island scenarios. <br />
<br />
Those zones are large, but it's definitely do-able, it's just a matter of justifying it for dev time. <br />
<br />
Again, I doubt they are, but there are reasons to do it.</div></div><hr />

Well the hearthstone expansion got somewhat leaked. The korean youtube of hearthstone uploaded a vid with a name that translates into &quot;Brawl of Rastakhan&quot; which was promptly made private.

The game comes out today, would they really have a large area for that? Besides, what if the Diablo 3 demo area is for Switch demos? Man I failed reading.<br />

<br />
A D2 remaster would be a pretty huge announcement, and VERY likely due to Blizzard current path of making money on older content. D2 has been out of their hands for some time with regards to making money form it. A new remastered version, locked to Battle.net account will allow them to resell it again, and perhaps this time with some store features.<br />
<br />
Still, I have hopes of a World of Diablo MMORPG.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, Hall D appears to be the largest section on the floor. You don't do that unless you have something big.<br />

Sry mate, WoW is here to stay for quite some time.<br />
<br />
I dunno about that. With Classic coming out, they may very well be calling an end to WoW, and just start re-releasing it in Classic Expansion style.<br />
<br />
It also starts one to thinking, are the ideas the &quot;stole from Diablo&quot; and incorporated in the past few expansions really steal from Diablo, or directly from the World of Diablo in development. Most liekly using the same engine as current WoW?<br />
<br />
Instead of releasing an expansion after BfA, they could very well release Classic at that time instead. Maybe after a few years they would come out with a &quot;current&quot; expansion that provides closure to the lore/storylines.. but it is clear they feel liek they've done all they can with the game... and are just money grabbing now.<br />
<br />
I would be delighted with that to be honest. Commit to a re-release of the game.. everyone starting fresh. And enjoying it if that is their thing... then offering a World of Diablo with all new characters and lore based on Diablo1, 2 and 3.<br />
<br />
Although... they really need to call it something like Diablo Universe... as having the letters WoD will taste really bad to some.</div></div><hr />

Possibly. I can't see this years Diablo news being anything special after just looking at the Schedule. 45 minute opener, 45 minute Q and A, that's it. Not much floor time for something new unless I'm reading this wrong.</div></div><hr />

Odd that this is the first time I heared about this. Good thing is, this also busts the pirate speculation we have at Hearthpwn. And I'm glad the leak is fake. If we only get a D2 remaster and a Druid DLC, I will riot.</div></div><hr />

The korean youtube of hearthstone uploaded a vid with a name that translates into &quot;Brawl of Rastakhan&quot; which was promptly made private. So there is your leak. Hearthstone is gonna be troll themed! Which btw also instantly busts the whole leak we talked about earlier.<br />
<br />
Funnily enough, i just stumbled across this text at the bottom of an amusing PC Gamer article about the game SCUM;<br />
<br />
<br />
Once every generation, Azeroth's Troll tribes come together to compete for the blessings of the Loa and the favor of King Rastakhan. The no-holds-barred battle forms the basis for Rastakhan's Rumble, the next Hearthstone expansion, which was just revealed today as part of the BlizzCon opening ceremony. <br />
<br />
Nine teams will take part in the latest iteration of this time-honored Troll-down, each led by a Legendary Troll Champion representing one of the Hearthstone classes. The Loa, ancient spirits worshipped by the Trolls, will also take part in the fighting as Legendary minions. Shirvallah the Tiger is the Paladin Loa, which costs a cool 25-Mana to cast. You can reduce that outlay by casting spells, but even so it seems like a restrictive price for an effect that's probably only going to be good in incredibly slow control decks.<br />

Came here looking for any other evidence of it.</div></div><hr />

Good thing is, this also busts the pirate speculation we have at Hearthpwn. And I'm glad the leak is fake. If we only get a D2 remaster and a Druid DLC, I will riot.<br />
<br />
It's gonna be based on Stranglethorn Vale, so you will get pirates.</div></div><hr />

This is where I got it from https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/9slp1p/blizzard_korea_leaks_new_hearthstone_expansion/?st=JO045CSY&amp;sh=c7f27e94<br />
<br />
Also pcgamer leaked a full description of the whole thing just now. Its up on hearthpwn and on the hearthstone reddit. So yeah, someone goofed and the original leak we talked about is 100% fake.</div></div><hr />

It wouldn't take dev time from WoW devs you maroon. They have a Classic game team that does that sorta thing. :confused:</div></div><hr />

Lets see piece of quoniam. Who said anything about WOW dev time? Dev time in general, even if they dedicate it on cleaning the toilets of their HQ, is better spent than in this shit remaster idea.</div></div><hr />

D2 has been out of their hands for some time with regards to making money form it. A new remastered version, locked to Battle.net account will allow them to resell it again, and perhaps this time with some store features.<br />
<br />
Still, I have hopes of a World of Diablo MMORPG.<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, Hall D appears to be the largest section on the floor. You don't do that unless you have something big.<br />

I dunno about that. With Classic coming out, they may very well be calling an end to WoW, and just start re-releasing it in Classic Expansion style.<br />
<br />
It also starts one to thinking, are the ideas the &quot;stole from Diablo&quot; and incorporated in the past few expansions really steal from Diablo, or directly from the World of Diablo in development. Most liekly using the same engine as current WoW?<br />
<br />
Instead of releasing an expansion after BfA, they could very well release Classic at that time instead. Maybe after a few years they would come out with a &quot;current&quot; expansion that provides closure to the lore/storylines.. but it is clear they feel liek they've done all they can with the game... and are just money grabbing now.<br />
<br />
I would be delighted with that to be honest. Commit to a re-release of the game.. everyone starting fresh. And enjoying it if that is their thing... then offering a World of Diablo with all new characters and lore based on Diablo1, 2 and 3.<br />
<br />
Although... they really need to call it something like Diablo Universe... as having the letters WoD will taste really bad to some.<br />
<br />
Friend believes they're going to take it MMO-lite with Diablo. Either The Division-esque or maybe like Vermintide/L4D.</div></div><hr />
