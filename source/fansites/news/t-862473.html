First thing that popped into my head was maybe the guild perk spells. Like only able to summon everyone in raid like 10x a week or something. I hope this doesnt effect the mass ressurect (even if its a 10min &quot;un-massressible&quot; debuff when used...).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard has told Eurogamer that the Firelands raid – the next tier of endgame raiding progression for the MMO – will not appear in the next patch, 4.1, as it had previously planned.<br />
<br />
In an interview at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, lead producer J. Allen Brack said that players were not sufficiently advanced through the raid content that shipped with third expansion Cataclysm in December to handle the challenge of Firelands. He also suggested that Blizzard was thinking of creating &quot;smaller&quot; content patches for World of Warcraft. <br />

<br />
You're forgetting that, as it currently stands, they took Fury mastery and made is completely useless. Like, more useless than it was before they buffed it, and back then it was our worst stat.<br />
<br />
So, they are increasing sustained damage, trying to nerf burst, and almost completely removed our biggest self heal as well as our Raging Blow damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4.1 will NOT be 2 months away if this is the case. Id say more like, month and a half at the latest. 4.2 probably the end of May/Begin of June, would be my guess at least<br />
<br />
Also, I find it highly inlikely you've fully cleared the content, as something like less than 100 guilds worldwide have fully cleared this tier so far. That does NOT mean a new tier should be put out. Sure, by end of April, maybe 300+, but thats still not enough.</div></div><hr />

4.1 will NOT be 2 months away if this is the case. Id say more like, month and a half at the latest. 4.2 probably the end of May/Begin of June, would be my guess at least<br />
<br />
Also, I find it highly inlikely you've fully cleared the content, as something like less than 100 guilds worldwide have fully cleared this tier so far. That does NOT mean a new tier should be put out. Sure, by end of April, maybe 300+, but thats still not enough.<br />
<br />
Not everyone cares about Heroic Raids....<br />
<br />
Looking at June now for 4.2... they already said Ulduar took too long to come out, and they are doing the same thing again.</div></div><hr />

I'll probably take the point outta Nature's Bounty and put it in there. I can live with the Lifebloom nerf since they reverted the mana cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could this mean the next Arena Tournament is coming up in a few months?<br />
<br />
As for when I think 4.2 will come out.. maybe early July because the average timeframe of the PTR for major content patches is 2 months, and if 4.2 hits the PTR shortly after 4.1 (which has already been stated to have almost 2 months left on the PTR until release, according to the Eurogamer article) then late June/early July would be the most accurate time period for a release. I'm hoping early July, I don't want the next tier coming out as buggy as the first at release.</div></div><hr />

What the heck? 50% longer CD and 16% reduced effectiveness. Cause you know, Disc Priests are way too amazing right now. Specifically because PW:B is so op. /endrant</div></div><hr />

<br />
its only affecting autoattacks. things like bloodthirst, raging blow, execute, slam, etc, will remain the same.</div></div><hr />

Tier 2 Heroic give 140 VP, so we will have nothing to spend them on. Unless they put in new VP items that are ilvl above 359... mmmm<br />

<br />
They already said that ToC came out too fast, not giving players enough time to enjoy and raid through Ulduar. And that's what they want to avoid with the current tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah but still.<br />
You do now that auto attacks usually is in the top 3 of most damage dealing abilities?.<br />
<br />
Bloodthirst, Raging Blow, Auto Attacks (and they swap leader position pending on your RNG luck)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lumineus</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ulduar was out for a long time. The reason people didn't get to &quot;experience&quot; it was because it was over-ambitious. 14 bosses, really? OK, so four of them are optional (or not, if you need the loot, like the axe off the fire giant in 25 or the trinket from the protodragon in 10) but that's still longer than Molten Core, and Molten Core was like a 10 hour slog-fest, assuming you went with a group that actually needed T1 gear and wasn't just farming Ragnaros for pants. They could have cut the first two wings entirely. Well, maybe left Kologarn in for teh lulz.<br />
<br />
DK buffs are nice. Frost on the way to becoming a three-button wonder though. I think Wrath Ret was more complex.<br />
<br />
I think they might have gone overboard with the Fury buffs at this juncture. Bet they end up nerfing the cooldown of Colossus Smash, effectively making it a clone of Waylay.</div></div><hr />

why cant they figure out whats gonna happen if they remove such a key ability for a class. <br />
But they are good at overnerfing and quick at giving half of it back, its so blizzard.</div></div><hr />
