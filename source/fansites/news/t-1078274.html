Account Wide Achievements<br />
While we’re still working out many of the details regarding account-wide achievement functionality, I want to clarify that we plan for the system to apply to all achievements -- not just those added in Mists of Pandaria. It’s intended to be an overall change to the current achievement system.<br />
<br />
Our goal is to make it so that you feel like you only have to get an achievement once. We think the time and effort you put into achievements should be evident regardless of which character you’re playing. The update will be implemented at the Battle.net level and, as such, would apply to all of the attached World of Warcraft licenses on the account. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216957-shared-achievements/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4015164096?page=9#161))<br />
<br />
Account Wide Achievements<br />
I want everyone to be a bit cautious about their expectations as of yet. We still have a lot of details to work out in regard to how this will all work. Once we have more specific information to share on it, we'll let you all know. I don't want anyone to get too far ahead on things until we can share more and explain any possible &quot;ifs&quot;, &quot;ands&quot;, and &quot;buts&quot; with you all should there be any put in place. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216988-account-wide-achievements-need-clarification/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4015344602#12))<br />

Please Welcome Nyorloth!<br />
In a break from tradition, I am not a member of the Community team; long have I gestated within the Story Development division of the Publishing Team, itself a division of Creative Development. My purposes here are myriad, but to mention a few:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Increase the transparency of how we develop stories within our games and ancillary fiction.<br />
Encourage more constructive discussions of the lore, so that we may better understand your likes/dislikes in order to shape our future projects.<br />
To serve as a scapegoat for when something happens in the lore that you don’t like.<br />
<br />
<br />
My eye has glimpsed the forming of an Ask CDev on the horizon... perhaps, even, Soon™! You would all do well to gather your questions now, in preparation for this momentous event.

<br />
Actually they spoke about that awhile back. Their first goal is to do account wide companions (since they'll be using the pet battle system). If everything transitions over smoothly and no problems then they will start to slowly work on mounts being account wide as well. They'd rather start with the companions first and work out kinks before adding mounts to the table.</div></div><hr />

Wonderful. However, the biggest issue - to me, and probably any other tank - is that they don't land reliably. Some do, some don't. Can we now get them to actually land on the ground faster, so I can pick them up without having to stand directly underneath them? A step or two away from directly under, and they can't be melee'd.</div></div><hr />

I'm surprised. They actually fixed the issue before the end of the event. Feel bad for those who abandoned the DMF quest, though.</div></div><hr />

It would be a rather funny sight, but I bet that Blizzard may put in some sort of level-lock for certain achievements to keep things from becoming &quot;too silly&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Right, because getting the wannabe elitist forming the raid to believe that you're 6/7 hard modes on your main and really are good enough for his scrub pug is fun. Wake up. Achievements should have been account wide from the beginning.</div></div><hr />

I don't believe that current content achievements are going to be account-wide for exactly that reason - the number of wipes I've seen because some idiot knows the fight in one role and has no idea on another is massive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't believe how many people make this mistake: just because they have the achievement does not mean they did it on the role they want to use. Ok, yes, if they're a pure dps class you know they did it on dps. But the Prot Warrior could've gotten it as Arms, the Holy Paladin as Ret, etc. None of the tank/heal classes are exclusive to one role. Restricting account-wide achievements on current content doesn't change that problem, so this argument isn't valid.<br />

I presume it's metrics; so they can analyse what/when works -beyond YouTube's own'; that and the licensing structure which YouTube applies. <br />
<br />
Personally I've given up on these videos -not just the presenter, which was my first annoyance (like bullet to the head annoyance) -it's the content, too, which is presented in such an armature adhoc fashion that I feel patronised lest we forget that this is a profitable business here. <br />

Nah, they just know that there's an entire subset of whiners that'll bitch if it turns out What A Long Strange Trip ... can't give you 310% flying on every single one of your accounts. It's always better to temper expectations until you know exactly what you're going to be able to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For sure, but there's been very little development on that side, even if it means leaving some rewards out of the account-wide scheme for obvious reasons (but as you say, some people will whine no matter what); it just feels like they're letting it drift away for now, though.</div></div><hr />

I'm also assuming since they're making the pets/mounts account -wide, it makes sense to make those related achievements to be account-wide :D</div></div><hr />

Those who play the game casually can still &quot;progress&quot; their account as a whole by using various characters and those who play more seriously, be it hardcore raiding or competitive PvPing or just putting in more time across more characters, get the benefit of their efforts and time reflected across their account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, kill stats being account wide as well. That would be scary.</div></div><hr />
