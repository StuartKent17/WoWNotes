Arcane Mage Hidden Artifact Appearance<br />
The Order of the Shepherd discord (https://discord.gg/dhuxpqW) found The Woolomancer's Charge (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139558-the-woolomancers-charge) that unlocks a sheep appearance for the Arcane Mage artifact. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
There are different mobs in the Broken Isle zones you need to do a one time polymorph on:<br />
<br />
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Azsuna (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43787-zone-targets-polymorphed-azsuna) - Cliffwing Hippogryph (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/89386-cliffwing-hippogryph)<br />
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Highmountain (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43788-zone-targets-polymorphed-highmountain) - Highpeak Goat (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/99636-highpeak-goat)<br />
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Stormheim (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43789-zone-targets-polymorphed-stormheim) - Plains Runehorn Calf (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/107808-plains-runehorn-calf)<br />
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Suramar (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43791-zone-targets-polymorphed-suramar) - Heartwood Doe (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/110043-heartwood-doe)<br />
Zone Targets Polymorphed: Val'sharah (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43790-zone-targets-polymorphed-valsharah) - Wild Dreamrunner (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/109819-wild-dreamrunner)<br />
<br />
Reach Artifact Knowledge level 6.<br />
Every day you have a chance to unlock the next part of the chain via the Sheep Summon Daily Roll (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/43828-sheep-summon-daily-roll) by entering your Order Hall<br />
When the roll is successful, a Volatile Sheep (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111107-volatile-sheep) will appear next to you in the Order Hall. Click it until it explodes.<br />
Head to Runewood in Stormheim and find the Extremely Volatile Stormheim Sheep (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111691-extremely-volatile-stormheim-sheep). Click it until it explodes.<br />
Head to the Tower of Azora in Elwynn Forest and meet Cote &quot;Shepherd&quot; Metcalf (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111704-cote-shepherd-metcalf). <br />
Help him defeat the Enraged Elwynn Sheep (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111745-enraged-elwynn-sheep), witness another part of the event, and then kill him.<br />
Loot the The Woolomancer's Charge (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139558-the-woolomancers-charge)!<br />
Occasionally when polymorphing things, the staff will change from the regular model to the model below and scream. <br />

Rated PvP Gearing Changes<br />
As we’d previously announced, our intention with gear rewarded from rated PvP in Patch 7.0.3 is for the chance to receive a Warforged/Titanforged piece of gear to increase as your rating increases. We’ve recently discovered a bug that is causing that system not to function. Currently, rated PvP is always rewarding item level 840 gear, regardless of rating. That is not our intent.<br />
<br />
We’re currently working on a fix for this issue, and once it’s ready, we’ll apply it during weekly restarts. We want to correct it as quickly as possible, but don’t want to inadvertently punish players who have already collected their weekly bonus chests. We’re also implementing more rigorous testing procedures for future PvP seasons to ensure that this doesn’t happen again.<br />
<br />
Realistically, we should have caught this bug during testing, but didn’t. That’s completely our fault, and we apologize. That said, we’re not really happy with the current model for PvP gearing anyway (even ignoring this issue), and we’re planning to make a couple of key changes for Patch 7.1.<br />
<br />
For starters, instead of having rating increase the chance for a piece to roll Warforged or Titanforged, it will increase the minimum item level that a piece can be. So, as your rating increases, you will be guaranteed to earn higher item level gear, regardless of whether it Warforges or not. We’re also going to clearly tell you what the minimum item level you can receive is, to remove the guesswork.<br />
<br />
Secondly, instead of basing gear off of your current rating, it will be based on the highest rating you earned in the previous week. This means you’ll always be rewarded for your best performance of the week, no matter when exactly that was.<br />
<br />
Again, we apologize that we didn’t recognize and correct the issue with the current gearing system sooner, but are hopeful that the changes in Patch 7.1 will result in a better overall experience for everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Classes<br />

<br />
Unstable Affliction's dispel kickback damage is now capped at 50% of the Warlock's maximum health, but can still critically strike.<br />
Destruction Warlocks that are stuck on the final Artifact acquisition quest &quot;Ritual Ruination&quot; should now find it easier to get through all obstacles. Any Warlock that has the Artifact, but is stuck on a quest objective, can return to Dalaran to get full credit for the quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Halls<br />
<br />
New work orders for Seals of Broken Fate will now have a shipment duration of 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Assault on Violet Hold<br />
<br />
The final encounters in Heroic and Mythic Violet Hold should now be properly reflected in your Statistics page upon completion.<br />
<br />
Darkheart Thicket<br />
<br />
(Mythic difficulty) Oakheart should no longer reset once awoken.<br />
<br />
Emerald Nightmare<br />
<br />
Xavius<br />
<br />
Dead players should no longer become stuck if they release their spirit during the teleport to The Emerald Dream after defeating Xavius.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Augment Runes will now function in Mythic Keystone dungeons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />

<br />
Herbalism<br />
<br />
The droprate for seeds has been reduced to 2.5% for all herbs, except Felwort, which remains at a 25% chance to loot a seed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Ashran<br />
<br />
All methods of turning in Artifact Fragments should now correctly reward honor at a rate of 1 honor for every 2 Artifact Fragments.<br />
<br />
The Rated PvP gear weekly bonus rewards are now based on the player's PvP Rating for 2v2, 3v3, and Rated Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Currently, rated PvP is always rewarding item level 840 gear, regardless of rating. That is not our intent. We want to correct this as quickly as possible, but don’t want to inadvertently punish players who have already collected their weekly bonus chests. This fix will be implemented with the next weekly realm maintenance (A.M. PDT on Tuesday, October 4 for North American realms).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
These Suramar World Quests now correctly award Nightfallen reputation beyond Honored: “Studying the Reaction”, “Clear the Skies”, “Left for Dead”, and “Fiends of Tel'anor”.<br />
(Work in progress) Addressed multiple issues with the World Quest &quot;Electrosnack&quot; regarding tapping and some cosmetic elements.<br />
Players who would have otherwise died to falling damage in the Withered Army Training scenario should now be reduced to 1 hp. First Arcanist Thalyssra will now port you back to the front of the ruins.<br />
World Quests completed with a Combat Ally will once more correctly award experience to the Follower.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
FEEDBACK: Karazhan!<br />
The new Karazhan dungeon is now open for testing on the PTR! It will remain open over the weekend. This is a Mythic-only dungeon, so form a group of 5 players and venture to Deadwind Pass. The entrance to the new dungeon is on the side of the tower, accessed via an elevated bridge (the front door will still take you into the Burning Crusade raid). Player item level will be normalized inside the dungeon for testing purposes. <br />
<br />
Please use this thread for your feedback; thanks for testing!<br />

Warlord's Deathwheel: Horde Availability<br />
I'm still confused as to how the Horde &quot;won&quot;, when the bike is no longer available, whereas the Alliance one is. What's the problem with making the Horde one avaliable again for 100k?<br />
There are a few unfortunate legal obligations that have halted a release of the Horde's Deathwheel, from what I understand. Something about &lt;insert legal jargon about prizing&gt;.<br />
<br />
Again, an unfortunate circumstance, but I'm not sure that anything can be done.<br />
<br />
I'll bring this up again next week and see if anything has changed since I last asked about this a few months back.

Yet they will drop everything to tell a death knight that warriors will be nerfed. Maybe think a little before you post.<br />
To be fair, Ignore Pain was a bit* ridiculous before the nerf.<br />
<br />
*See: absolutely, incredibly, extraordinarily<br />
<br />
Yes, however it is all we have. We can hardly use shield block because we need to get to that IP. If IP was the problem tune that, not our rage.<br />
<br />
Edit: If you're still reading please have someone put a patchnote out for the prot warrior hidden appearance hotfix. People have been logging in and out for hours with no indication it doesn't work.<br />
Indeed!<br />
<br />
The flip of that: we are discussing a potential hotfix to increase rage generation from Shield Slam and reduce Ignore Pain's maximum absorption, so hopefully that will help with any 'clunky' feeling that Warriors have been noting.

Throw Glaive dmg was nerfed by 30% by accident even tho you guys struck it from the patch notes.(tooltip is right, dmg isnt)<br />
This is in line with expected behavior. Physical damage is reduced by Armor. It will deal ~30% less than the tooltip vs a Training Dummy.(WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/780842338457231360))<br />

For what its worth, the log in/log out method was working as of 3 am on October 1st, because that's what I was doing and I got it after three hours.<br />

<br />
They're talking, in a very ambigious way, about the rank 3 felwort bonus where you can get felwort seeds from any herb. As i understand it, weople were going around farming herbs and planting seeds in groups, using the Aethril bonus (which procs extra herbs) to gather loads of seeds. Which was an inventive way to go about it but something blizz doesn't seem to want happening...<br />
<br />
so now a change is enacted which hurts solo herbalists more than anything, to the point of a rank 3 trait being useless and having no point in existing.</div></div><hr />

Ignorance is bliss... I hope your comment doesn't reflect your RL. As with all hidden artifact skins that work with a daily trigger, relogging resets it.<br />

Besides being ignorant and wrong, you are also pathetic enough to gkick a person for playing how he wants, just because you can't find the option to disable guild activity feed. Nice.</div></div><hr />

Nice.<br />
<br />
No, I don't need people who can't read in my guild. If you are relogging many times a day to try to proc something that has a daily chance of happening you shouldn't be in my guild. Sorry that you think it is wrong to have standards that include basic reading comprehension in a game that revolves around reading.<br />

Ignorance is bliss... I hope your comment doesn't reflect your RL. As with all hidden artifact skins that work with a daily trigger, relogging resets it.<br />
<br />
Who's the stupid one now huh?<br />
<br />
Blizzard for allowing the bug to persist. And those attempting to exploit said bug for something cosmetic.</div></div><hr />

Happened 3 times in a Mythic 7 run we were doing, the third time at 2%. Highly highly frustrating.</div></div><hr />

You must have the most delicate ego ever to refuse being corrected on such an inane matter.</div></div><hr />

Supply and demand? More people crying about herb prices than people farming the herbs means prices go up. Prices were only so cheap in WoD because everyone could convert excess garrison resources into crafting reagents. If you played in WoD you shouldn't be crying about gold. 1000 gold a day for 5 mins, at most, of effort. Multiply that by the number of alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not everyone did garrisons. Also WoD had the lowest subs ever and Legion broke records for highest so that means a lot of people coming back that aren't sitting at gold cap. You're right it is about supply and demand, Blizzard sees the demand and is decreasing the supply to push people into buying gold. It shouldn't cost 40k gold a week just to raid that's fucking ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

What correction? That you can currently exploit a bug? Sorry, but that isn't a valid correction for me.</div></div><hr />
