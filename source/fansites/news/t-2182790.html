<br />
Adjustments to Legendary Items in 7.2<br />
In an upcoming PTR patch, you will see adjustments to a number of legendary items. These changes can be categorized into:<br />
<br />
<br />
Added throughput effects to legendaries with non-throughput bonuses, or only occasional throughput benefits.<br />
<br />
Example: Promise of Elune, the Moon Goddess (Balance Druid boots that grant a utility healing effect via casting Lunar Strike/Solar Wrath), will now also increase the damage of Lunar Strike and Solar Wrath by 8%.<br />
<br />
Added extra secondary stats to non-throughput legendaries where that makes more sense than to add throughput to the legendary effect itself.<br />
<br />
Example: Belo'vir's Final Stand (Mage chest that causes Blink to grant an absorb shield) now have an extra 3rd secondary stat. We don’t want to turn Blink into a rotational DPS button, so instead of adding an effect like “Blink also increases your damage dealt by X% for Y sec”, we’re adding an extra ~650 secondary stats to the item.<br />
<br />
Improvements to legendaries whose design isn’t working well in gameplay.<br />
<br />
This has been and will continue to be an ongoing effort, and we’ll be making such changes as time goes on, including after Patch 7.2.<br />
<br />
Numbers tuning to bring the throughput benefits of other legendaries more in line with each other.<br />
<br />
This has been and will also continue to be an ongoing effort.<br />
<br />
Legendaries have different use cases and we want their power level to be tuned with that in mind. Universal throughput legendaries - legendaries that increase output in most situations - should be good but not always the best in every situation. Situational throughput legendaries – legendaries that perform very well in the right situation - should be better than universal throughput legendaries in those situations, but then aren’t ideal in other situations. Non-throughput legendaries will soon include a small amount of consistent output through either an adjustment to their legendary effect or an extra 3rd secondary stat, and continue to provide their utility benefits.<br />
<br />
By narrowing the power gap between throughput legendaries and non-throughput legendaries, we’re hopeful that 1) the first two legendaries a character acquires will have some reliable throughput increase and 2) once you acquire more of them, you’ll feel more freedom to swap them around based on the situation.<br />
<br />

Patch 7.2 - Flying Achievement Change<br />
The Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11446-broken-isles-pathfinder-part-two) achievement was changed on the PTR. <br />
Thanks for the feedback, everyone! The original currency requirement for Nethershards in this quest was temporary until final Nethershard costs and drop rates were determined. The current requirement for this quest is 2500 Nethershards. Also, *spoiler* Khadgar realizes that he was a bit overzealous and at the conclusion of the quest determines he only needs 1. So the player is left with the remaining 2499 to use as they please.<br />
<br />
Additionally, some folks are worried that the Legionfall Campaign is going to stop them from flying. It's not! The campaign is not a requirement to unlock flying in 7.2. One of the early versions of the achievement had that as a requirement, but it has since been removed.<br />
<br />
Can we see EXACTLY what is in the amended achievement.<br />
You can see this on the PTR right now. It looks like the datamining sites are a bit out of date though.<br />
<br />
1. Part 1 completed<br />
2. Explore Broken Shore - Go to every POI<br />
3. Defender of the Broken Isles - Complete Demon Assault (incl. scenario) in each of the 4 zones that have them<br />
4. Reach Revered Rep with Legionfall faction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2 - Glorious Tyranny Visual Change<br />
The Glorious Tyranny (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/120286-enchanters-illusion-glorious-tyranny) enchant has been changed in Patch 7.2. You can see an example of the change on a smaller and larger weapon below. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/thumb/enchantChange01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/enchantChange01.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/thumb/enchantChange02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/enchantChange02.jpg) <br />
<br />
When we made the Glorious Tyranny enchant during the Mists of Pandaria expansion, we went for maximum cool looks. Unfortunately, the result has proved to be negative for computer performance.<br />
<br />
Our artists regularly make performance improvement passes on things like this, and this particular enchant visual is one of their priorities for Patch 7.2. They're doing what's necessary to improve performance when this enchant is active, but as you can see, the look has changed a bit.<br />
<br />
We’re trying here to balance helping players who are having issues and restoring the original appearance, but ultimately there's going to have to be a small change in how it looks.<br />

Patch 7.2 PTR - Flying Testing NPC Disabled Next Build<br />
Just wanted to give a quick heads up that, with the next PTR build, we'll be removing Petey Yar (the test NPC that granted the achievements required for 7.2 flying) from Dalaran, and implementing the intended requirements to activate the Class Mount quests.<br />
<br />
So, if you want to do any additional testing/experimenting with 7.2 Flying or Class Mounts, you have until the next PTR update to do so!<br />
<br />
<br />
Build of the Month - March 2017<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />

This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/ssdgraph.gif) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7UZMAK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00L7UZMAK). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 7700K and would get more performance from spending that money elsewhere.<br />

The difference between legendaries should never be &quot;utility&quot; vs &quot;dps increase&quot;. It should be &quot;utility and dps&quot; against &quot;no utility, slightly more dps&quot;. Sure, pure throughput items will still be superior, but the difference won't be nearly as massive. There might actually be fights where 'utility' effects are worth using if it's only a minimal dps loss.</div></div><hr />

There will always be those bis legendary s and not having them will suck. I understand we should have em all by the end of the expansion but that will suck for alts that i dont feel like farming legendary s and ap on. I still feel that the best way to fix the legendary problem is to have something for us to have to farm to trade in a for a legendary or trade a legendary in with a bunch of other shit u had to farm to get the one u really want to play with. This seems to me just a band aid. and a bad one</div></div><hr />

Though with current values, it would have to be around 2000-2500 of your best secondary stat to even compare to the mediocre dps legendaries for Mages. Though, yes they said they are going to rebalance the legendaries, but they've said it before and we still went to Nighthold with the best Mage legendaries giving more than 10% more DPS for Fire and Frost.<br />
<br />
The 650 will probably be Mastery and that will turn out as 0.8-1.5% more DPS, depending on if the stat distribution on the item will be changed, if it is(like Prydaz).. it will be closer to 1% for most Mage specs. Which just isn't enough, but it's a move to the right direction.</div></div><hr />

I blame WoD for cultivating the kind of player that thinks that as long as he/she clears the latest raid every week, they should always be 100% optimal, and people that don't raid can.. uh. Unsub because there's no power gain to attain outside of raid gear.<br />
<br />
Just look at how people treat artifact power. It's designed to be something you earn all the time, and 'capping' should be for the most hardcore mythic raiders only, but people are seemingly unable to set realistic expectations on themselves. They see AP and all they see is a huge grind they have to finish before they are 'competitive'. But to be fair, the fact that some bosses in Nighthold were tuned around 54 traits, something I sure didn't expect from Blizzard, was a gigantic mistake and only reinforced the community idea that you're uncompetitive otherwise. Instead of letting progressive gear upgrades do the talking (why do raids have to be clearable day 1 anyway?) they only gave the &quot;54 traits or bust&quot; movement air under their wings.<br />
<br />
Legendaries will always have &quot;BiS&quot; (and if it wasn't equip effects it'd be chests/leggings for the pure stats) and until players learn to accept that legendaries aren't supposed to be &lt;get BiS leg 1&gt; &lt;get BiS leg 2&gt; &lt;now you're ready to raid&gt;. Blizzard making these changes sadly only cements the idea that anything that isn't guaranteed and attainable within a week are bad design.<br />
No, raid-and-log-out is bad design.</div></div><hr />

Well kaby lake works on older 1151 socket Mobos with a bios update(which most manufacturers pushed out), and for puppy instead of putting in i3-7100 they should have used G4560, a great budget CPU, which holds its own on the level of the i3. why overpay?</div></div><hr />

I can understand why they're pairing up a 7th gen core CPU with a a 2xx chipset motherboard, it's kind of russian roulette whether or not you actually get the board with up to date BIOS and if you don't have a 6th gen CPU it's a hassle for someone that isn't quite as tech savvy to update the BIOS.<br />
<br />
The thing that does bother me though is their insistence on pushing a Z chipset motherboard with a non-K CPU for the puppy build. You could get a very decent non-Z chipset board and an i5 for the same price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Their solution to legendaries is to end upwith them not being legendary at all. And they will all be basically weak so that you probably won;t care which one you have and the deciding factor will be the stats.<br />
<br />
It's a funny thing, how the community predicted ALL of the issues that have plagued legendaries. The moment the items were revealed and players saw how incredibly powerful some of them were and how incredibly crap others were, and that they were random drops from any content level there were hundreds of posts about &quot;Are they serious about implementing this? It's crazy&quot;<br />
<br />
But of course they did not listen and here we are six months down the line and yet another set of sticking plasters incoming...<br />
<br />
As to the Q&amp;A's. It is a classic politician's ploy, to hold lengthy debates and press conferences about things you want to talk about and which are of no great importance or interest; it makes th epublic feel you are &quot;listening&quot; and &quot;responsive&quot; . Meanwhile there is just a wall of silence about stuff the voters are really worried about because a debate would mean awkward questions to which there are no pat answers. Questions like<br />
<br />
&quot;Soul Effigy is horrible, everyone hated it through Alpha just like mages hated Prismatic Crystal, why did you stick with it?&quot;<br />
<br />
But of course, these Q&amp;A's are pre-scripted, they decide the questions - it;s not like there is an awkward reporter shouting &quot;but what about the tax rises you promised weren;t happening??&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Well, yea. Please tell me honestly that all classes get equal amount of dev's attention, if not, Class Q&amp;A is a possibility for the less &quot;popular&quot; classes to get *some* answers.</div></div><hr />

Well atleast in Europe it isn't:) But i see where are you coming from. Then why use z270 chipset for the cheapest one cpu isn't overclockable. Puppy i presume is the budget build. https://pcpartpicker.com/list/JMcfCy This build is almost identical to the puppy, i just didn't waste money on a case (deepcool tesseract is still decent looking and fits a fullsize cooler), got a g4560, h270 mobo and a cheaper optical drive( wanted to drop it all together) total is about 100$ less than your build.<br />

I can understand why they're pairing up a 7th gen core CPU with a a 2xx chipset motherboard, it's kind of russian roulette whether or not you actually get the board with up to date BIOS and if you don't have a 6th gen CPU it's a hassle for someone that isn't quite as tech savvy to update the BIOS.<br />
<br />
The thing that does bother me though is their insistence on pushing a Z chipset motherboard with a non-K CPU for the puppy build. You could get a very decent non-Z chipset board and an i5 for the same price.<br />
<br />
Well About the bios update, research does that and i have seen more shops performing a flash on the boards for about 10euros (they use their cpu and boom you are done), well they could have used h270 for the basic builds.</div></div><hr />

Simple because someone that is making those sets has no clue about up-to-date computing, including proper core count and technologies like HT. <br />
<br />
But anyway, if you don't know what to buy and read stuff like this on sites like this, even i3 will be an overkill for most of your needs ;)</div></div><hr />

If I had to venture a guess it's because usually the i7's are a waste of money for the performance increase. You'd be better off dumping that money into a graphics card than processor for gaming or almost any other part than the processor.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion though.</div></div><hr />

Good Lord, looking at your post history you have a negative attitude. Plenty of people still enjoy this &quot;trash bin of a game&quot;. Welcome to opinions, you don't like it, ok, I respect that, but there was zero need to make that post. Go back to gen-ot.</div></div><hr />

I know what to buy, just wondered why they don't list it here...<br />

Unicorn builds here have always been within a roughly $1500 price point. Sometimes a bit more, some times a bit less. But it has never been a &quot;price is not a concern&quot; build.<br />
<br />
If you want those types of builds, your better off looking at pcpartpicker.com</div></div><hr />

Think about it though. You could build the &quot;best&quot; machine for an obscene amount of money (over $5k). That would be ridiculous to suggest here because no on would buy it. I mean I can see the curiosity in what &quot;the best&quot; is but no one would buy it.<br />
<br />
I'd have to agree with the other person that $1500 seems a pretty reasonable price point to set as a max for a desktop.<br />
<br />
Still, though, why would you want an i7? For gaming it's throwing money away -- which is what these machines are for. Spend the money on a faster hard drive, memory, or go quad SLI with your graphics card -- all of those you'd actually see a benefit from over going to an i7.<br />
<br />
Now if you're doing movie editing, programming large programs (or cpu intense programs) then that's a whole other story.</div></div><hr />

so you think my i7 6700 is overkill for gaming? got the fastest hard drive, 16 gb memory and r9 390 graphic card.</div></div><hr />
