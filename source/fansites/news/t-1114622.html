Another 250,000 Beta Invites Are Heading Out - Wave 5<br />
Blizzard is still working hard to make everyone happy and sent another wave of 250,000 Beta Invites, bringing the total to 800,000 Annual Pass Invites since the initial wave of beta testing!<br />
<br />
A few moments ago, we initialized a new wave of 250,000 invitations to the Mists of Pandaria beta test. These are all invitations for World of Warcraft Annual Pass subscribers, and it should be a few hours before the e-mail notifications for all recipients have been sent.<br />
<br />
If you want to make absolutely sure that you got an invite, just check your games list in Battle.net Account Services.<br />
<br />
As always, thank you very much for your enthusiasm in helping test Mists of Pandaria. We really appreciate your feedback.</div></div><hr />

The way they worded it made it sound like only the emails would take a while to go through. Maybe im just being pessimistic cause ive had a account for 5 years and no invite but people who have had it for 2 years got theirs</div></div><hr />

Don't Feel bad. Account since January 07 signed up for the annual pass 5 minutes after it was announced andIi've always paid my $15 a month no interrupts. I thought i was the only one having bad luck like that. So much for the taking how long you have played WoW into account.</div></div><hr />

Why thank you! :) I thought I should make the point, and coincidentally it is a point that allows me to remain in denial about not getting an invite in this wave just a little while longer...<br />

Same boat as you, except I've been playing since December 26th, 2004 (Got it Christmas the year it came out, played it ever since). Never once canceled my account, the moment the Annual Pass came around, I jumped on it. I'm starting to think that Blizzard really doesn't follow through with their promises. I honestly believed there was a priority system, but a friend of mine who joined literally 6 months ago, has already gotten an invite (This wave). <br />
<br />
Starting to lose my trust in Blizzard. If I'm not in the next wave, this could be what kills it for me. The beta was initially what intrigued me into signing up for the Pass, and here I am, one of the last to be invited. We're at 800,000 of around 1.3 million. <br />
<br />
Welp, good luck to the rest of you, hope some of you get invites soon.</div></div><hr />

Right now im taking hope(?) in the fact i havent seen one post saying 'Got my invite' was a few pages of it last wave so maybe they havent been sent out yet. If so you are much unluckier than me.</div></div><hr />

I can't imagine they need the hardware. They probably have it lying around in the data center. It's not like they already don't have thousands of servers running the live version. Then they could just invite all and force new people onto the new servers only. No more complaining.</div></div><hr />

Never once canceled my account, the moment the Annual Pass came around, I jumped on it. I'm starting to think that Blizzard really doesn't follow through with their promises. I honestly believed there was a priority system, but a friend of mine who joined literally 6 months ago, has already gotten an invite (This wave). <br />
<br />
Starting to lose my trust in Blizzard. If I'm not in the next wave, this could be what kills it for me. The beta was initially what intrigued me into signing up for the Pass, and here I am, one of the last to be invited. We're at 800,000 of around 1.3 million. <br />
<br />
Welp, good luck to the rest of you, hope some of you get invites soon.<br />
I vote that if we dont get in this wave everyone from 2008 and lower who hast gotten it calls in and destroys their phone lines. if we start costing them money they will listen to us. i have a friend who got in last wave. he has been playing since 2005/ AP holder, but wait... it wasnt even that account he got it on. he got it on an account he made last year for RaF and hasnt been active for months/ no AP</div></div><hr />

it takes them more than 24h to flag those accounts, be patient god damnit (as they stated earlier it would, even if flagging only needs a second, need around 55h for 300k invites - we just imply there is more than one flagging and, in the best case, its a computer, so just sit back).<br />

My wife, who started playing in BC and signed up for the AP the second day, got in on the second wave of invites.<br />

For real, I don't think ANY non-AP holders should be getting invites until ALL the AP holders have gotten one. I'll never get suckered into a promotion like this again, that's for sure.</div></div><hr />

1. When was the account open<br />
2. When did they sign up for the Annual Pass<br />

I opened my account in March of 2008.<br />
I signed up for the annual pass within an hour of it being announced at Blizzcon.<br />

If my case is any example, number 2 is not part of their decision tree in any meaningful way.</div></div><hr />

They should have said something like &quot;All AP holders will get access to the beta at some point. We will be doing this in random groups.&quot; Or something to that effect. The way they worded it made you think you had a chance of getting in earlier than you really do. Think it would have saved alot of butt hurt feelings from players.</div></div><hr />

There's been (literally) thousands of instances where that's been disproved. <br />
<br />
Also, so long as Blizzard gives all AP subscribers a beta invite before the game releases no one can take legal action. Hell, if you're shit out of luck and get a beta invite the day before release, Blizzard still has their ass covered...because you got the invite. Even though the server would go down in a few hours and you didn't get to play. Gotta love legal loop holes.</div></div><hr />

Ignoring the poor wording in this blue and going by the wording of all the other waves, the actual invites themselves (not just the confirmation emails) take a while to process so sit tight. Ironically most of the people whining up and down about their lack of an invite will later whine about how buggy/laggy/over populated the servers are, completely forgetting the purpose of a beta is to try your best to break and report things instead of treating it as a preview of an incomplete product.</div></div><hr />

They should have said something like &quot;All AP holders will get access to the beta at some point. We will be doing this in random groups.&quot; Or something to that effect. The way they worded it made you think you had a chance of getting in earlier than you really do. Think it would have saved alot of butt hurt feelings from players.<br />
<br />
We of course cannot know all of the internal variables in this situation, but yeah... My statement would have been along the lines, &quot;AP holders will be invited in randomly selected groups after the initial wave of Friends, Family, and Press as server stability permits. And given that there are over one million AP holders, we've decided to add some extra server capacity in an attempt to mitigate the negative effects of so many from our enthusiastic player base testing at once. Rest assured! All who signed up for the Annual Pass will be invited in a timely manner, and significantly before the end of the beta&quot;<br />

No...you're wrong. The beta is not over...therefore he/she doesn't know if they falsified anything. And btw.....the AP way of paying is no different than paying regular subscription time...don't know why people like to claim that. I pay monthly....I would have paid monthly if I hadn't signed up for the AP....I just got perks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. When was the account open<br />
2. When did they sign up for the Annual Pass<br />
<br />
I opened my account in March of 2008.<br />
I signed up for the annual pass within an hour of it being announced at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
If my case is any example, number 2 is not part of their decision tree in any meaningful way.<br />
<br />
How do you know? Blizzard never stated, as far as I am aware, what the actual algorithm is they are using to determine who gets beta invites. The actual rules their 'beta invite rollout program' is using are only known to them.<br />
<br />
For example they could give you one credit for every month subscription and one debit for every day you were late getting the AP subscription. This would give you a net score and they grab accounts based on the highest score. Of course I don't know how they do it but given the volumes it must be fully automated and 100% rule based. Nobody will sit there at Blizzard manually selecting 250000 accounts from all still to be invited AP subscribed accounts.</div></div><hr />

I know blizzard takes machine specifications into account, its one of the things they test in the beta. I've had my account since June 07 and I signed up for AP within a week, but I'm playing on a 2 year old laptop that can struggle sometimes running the game on normal settings. So my question to those who haven't got in is if you have a similar situation. Most people in my guild that have beta invites are running very nice machines. So I'm continuing to be patient until blizz decides if they want to see if my crappy laptop can handle the new xpac. Luckily I'll get to be on my brother's computer during the summer if it comes out soon.</div></div><hr />

Well from what I can tell and my way of checking recently is this. Visit http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/4675759/ it is the beta forums and you need an account to post there. From what I can tell some people have noticed being able to post there before even seeing it on their Battle.Net Account page. Also you don't have to login every 5 minutes like the Battle.Net page.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard has offically stated multiple times that the time you get your invite is based on when your account was started, how many months it has paid for, and when you bought the annual pass. No need to do it manually at all, it's an easy thing to let an automatic ''machine'' do aslong as you have access to their account database. Each account inside the database is marked for when they joined, how many months they've paid, and if they have the annual, and when they got it. That's also how you can see it on the Battle.net website, it gets it's data from the database from the server you play on (databases are nearly always split into servers).</div></div><hr />

I am beginning to believe its possible that some of them were just overlooked through some kink in the system, maybe because i have added other accounts to my b.net since. Either way, it seems there is no logic to the invite order.<br />
<br />
At this point im hoping i do not get a beta so i can bitch and complain and maybe get some free time =)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PsykoFanatic</div><div class="date">2012-04-12, 06:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I have a theory. I know blizzard takes machine specifications into account, its one of the things they test in the beta. I've had my account since June 07 and I signed up for AP within a week, but I'm playing on a 2 year old laptop that can struggle sometimes running the game on normal settings. So my question to those who haven't got in is if you have a similar situation. Most people in my guild that have beta invites are running very nice machines. So I'm continuing to be patient until blizz decides if they want to see if my crappy laptop can handle the new xpac. Luckily I'll get to be on my brother's computer during the summer if it comes out soon.<br />
I have a computer that can run it on ultra, so I'd say nope to that. Subscriber since 06, AP day 1. No invite.</div></div><hr />

I've been trying to keep my QQ on this to a minimum, but I still havent gotten the invite... by the time they invite me to beta all the servers will be crashed from everyone else playing.<br />
