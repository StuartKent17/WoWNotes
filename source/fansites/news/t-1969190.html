Legion PvP Stat Templates in World PvP<br />
Stat templates only work in instanced PvP like battlegrounds and arenas. Out in the world your stats come from your gear. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/406146-legion-world-pvp-scaling/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742845325?page=1#4))<br />

Vanilla PVP set and Transmog<br />
Thanks for the info. 1 Small addition. Hunter Alliance transmog on my shaman. Its mail, but i cant transmog to it because its limited to hunter class. Will the Hunter transmog be avalable for me as well? Let me live the dream of the Golden Shaman<br />
As it stands, this won't be possible as a Shaman can't equip gear with the Hunter class restriction. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405975-vanilla-pvp-set-and-transmogs/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17610902111?page=1#8))<br />

Won't changing Tank self heals/shields to AP scaling bring back the problems that Vengeance/Resolve were meant to fix?<br />
Those are solved other ways. This change doesn't affect that anyway. Was HP-based, now AP-based. Neither vary by inc dmg. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/710596309791727616))<br />

PvE<br />
Will there be a dmg/health bonus for MoP soloing similar to Cata/wrath etc? Just curious if that's in the works.<br />
The existing bonuses are because Wrath/Cata items were squished; MoP items weren't. If we did another squish, we'd add a MoP bonus. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/710508734137503744))<br />

Warcraft III and Diablo II Patches<br />
Both games got updates to improve modern system compatibility.<br />
Warcraft III has received a modern-day update!<br />
<br />
Patch 1.27a is aimed at enabling this legacy title to run smoothly on contemporary operating systems, and the client now has improved compatibility with Windows 7 and above and Mac OS X. Take a look at the Warcraft III forum post (http://us.battle.net/en/forum/topic/20742874519) for more information on the patch, and head over to the Battle.net Shop (https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos) to grab your digital copy of the game.<br />
<br />
We also released a similar patch for Diablo II. You can find more details on patch 1.14a on the Diablo II forum (http://us.battle.net/en/forum/topic/20742864181), and get your copy here (https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/diablo-ii).<br />
<br />
Further updates are planned for both Diablo II and Warcraft III in the future, as we keep working behind the scenes to make sure you continue to have a great gaming experience. Details will be available as development progresses. Thank you for continuing to play these classic games!</div></div><hr />

<br />
MoP was post stat squish, gear is now linear scaling from vanilla till cata. Ice crown bosses have the same health as panda bosses. You need a boost in damage to be able to kill them in a reasonable amount of time and for some classes to have any chance at soloing that old content. MoP is back to exponential scaling of stats on gear and your ilevel in each expansion going forward will increase your power when compared to mop (and WOD) bosses at a exponential rate. You dont need the damage buff to kill those old bosses due to the ilevel handling it for you. <br />
<br />
It just wouldnt feel right if Marrowgar took the same amount of time to kill as MoP bosses after the ilevel stat squish.</div></div><hr />

First of all, she's a well known actress, and second, GARONA ISN'T FULL ORC, she is half orc, half draenei, and made to look more human by Gul'dan, though in the movie I think they just say she's half orc, half human.</div></div><hr />

What are the &quot;reins&quot; attached to? They just sit against the neck. Are they bolted to the poor thing's head/neck? At least add a collar or something. &gt;_&lt; If it's just going to float there, may as well not have it there. It's unnecessary clutter. Unless the fox flies, I'm not taking magic as the answer on why the &quot;reins&quot; just float there. The &quot;reins&quot; aren't even functional since they're too thick to really be of use and too short. They're just there for clutter.<br />
<br />
With the fishing bobber, find it funny I asked Blizzard about those last year and now they're adding in quite a few. Would be nice if the bobbers were attachable like fishing lines to the rod so are permanent rather than a buff like lures. Issue would be the fishing line playing nice with the bobber, but Blizzard can make the two stack or have bobbers that give additional fishing, too.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't the stat squish just before WoD, so all the MoP gear and raids got squished as well? I am genuinely confused<br />
<br />
No, you're not getting the timeline mixed up; the squish was indeed implemented in 6.0, as part of the leadup to WoD. However, because MoP was still current at the time, nothing at 90 was squished, and the exponential scaling of 90 gear was retained, so level 90 content was not given the same legacy damage buff that older content was given.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not technically correct. MoP was squished, but it was not squished the same way as previous expansions. Vanilla to Cata were squished into a linear progression, while MoP was squished but allowed exponential increases over the expansions content.</div></div><hr />

Looks like something that should be on a superhero TV series like Flash or Daredevil, and it clashes pretty poorly with the font of the official logo (which looks good). Are they trying to distance it from being cheesy, stereotypical high-fantasy?<br />
<br />
I'm not feeling them either, but it's probably got nothing to do with Blizzard, it's who Legendary subbed the work out to - and it's generic at best stuff. With the money they're putting into ad buys for this movie, I'd expect better - and they should have had the Blizzard art department make the posters. Blizzard is one of the best art departments in the country, if not the world, and it's a crime Legendary is making posters like this with the talent they have access to.<br />
<br />
For a franchise so rich in lore and art and style, these posters are a huge disappointment. <br />
<br />
I'll skip the detailed critique - others have already done it, in detail.</div></div><hr />

1. That isn't some random black woman - that's Paula Patton who plays Garona Halforcen in the movie. <br />

2. I see that we will all have to buy that huge fishing bobber if we want to fish or our regular size bobber will be lost.<br />

I had the exact same thought. Though I guess it's more commonly &quot;Lolth,&quot; I was introduced to the &quot;Lloth&quot; version of the D&amp;D spider goddess' name when I first played, but maybe others aren't as familiar?<br />
<br />
However, with how blatantly Drow-themed the Nightborne are, you'd think Blizzard would have clued in that name being odd for a fox mount, especially when they're also introducing the spider.</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying you personally would. My point is they give you something that requires effort people complain and if they make that a store mount instead people complain. There is just no winning. The moose was a response to the crap they were getting from store mounts as well saying &quot;oh you only put unique well done models in the store&quot;.</div></div><hr />
