<br />
1. That may be nothing but they removed the wording of &quot;final task&quot; to the legendary ring. <br />
<br />
2. Felblood gronnling is the gladiator mount as the title before this build suggested. There is a 3rd season gladiator mount (the 3rd season was already in database earlier in 6.2 builds)<br />
<br />
3. 675 Garrison mission gives a gronnling. Somewhat interesting, not opposed to have some easy to get mounts if you kept up with followers. Also nice for those who don't care about the raid caches.<br />

<br />
not final patch? are they nuts?<br />
<br />
It fits with their idea of adding more content if necessary. They do have the 3rd PvP season in there too. They can always throw Cho'gall's master as 3rd tier if needed. Some story there. And Wrathion could mess something up again.</div></div><hr />

IF that Season 3 confirms a 6.3 (or whatever) raid....it is gonna take place on Azeroth and shit is gonna have hit the fan. I really don't see us staying on Draenor unless they miraculously open up the Ogre continent but that would only make sense IF they expand on Cho'gall's master and have all the Ogres answer to it.<br />
<br />
Either way....WoD may have just got a lot more interesting if 6.2 really isn't the final raid like everyone thinks/thought. It is just up to Blizzard to get their shit together and turn this expansion around. We still need more world content of some kind. Raids are well and good but we need stuff to do outside of that. It's kinda sad to see people only log in to raid.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how another major patch is a bad thing. I just dropped £30 on this expansion, I'd want to get my moneys worth before I buy another expansion. I don't see why people are so desperate to fork out another £30 so soon. You're pissed off with WoD, but instead of demanding that they make the expansion better, you just want to throw money at them to sweep the issue under the rug rather than fix it and give you your moneys worth? That's not customer service, that's stupid. Good for Blizzard though if the player base would rather pay THEM for a percieved slight. WoD has issues, but it'd be even worse of an expansion patch if we only got one major content patch.</div></div><hr />

So, I still highly assume, that there will be a third tier, hopefuly the siege of Stormwind or Ironforge (I know, would be lame, a siege again, but would be fitting, as Blizz has stated that WoD's end will be one of the Alliance finest hour, so what better than a defeated siege by the Iron Horde?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No Blizz didnt confirm/deny third tier yet. Im up for it, but who would we be fighting against? Iron Horde is in shambles. Legion will get shrekt in 6.2 and we will save Grom so he would have no reason to fight us later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah. They're assuming it because of the achievement change. But it doesn't mean anything. It just leaves them open to do something else and makes it look like they have something else planned to get people excited. The fact that it was originally &quot;final task&quot; tells me this is still the final tier. They just wanted to give the illusion of another patch. And no, this doesn't mean I think we're getting an expansion before fall of next year.</div></div><hr />

I think you forgot about Cho gall's master,and wrathion who is on the run from ogres.Neither is yet connected with 6.2.And why the hell would they want to create an illusion,they gain nothing from doing so</div></div><hr />

There's an NPC in the town hall now that sells the equivalent of Goredrenched Armor/Weapon for 500g each, so it'll be pretty easy to get folks up to 645 at least.

bottomline 6.2 is either the final patch with another extended content drought or we get a even more half-assed effort in 6.3 and the expansion with the least content ever drags on interminably...its not a pretty picture either way tbh</div></div><hr />

Until we know what is going on all we can do is wait.. On the flip side with all the better devs from Blizz having moved on and that WoW is 10 years old they would have to be running out of steam.. This is the problem with games like this, in the keeping up with ideas and being able to get engaging content coming out.. The same can be said for other MMO's once they have been around for a few years, they will start to run out of ideas as well..<br />
<br />
A perfect point is Hollywood look at most of the movies that are coming out, they are just remakes and reboots of previous movies.. Look at the new Terminator movie from seeing the trailer all it looks to be is a reboot of the first two movies combined with a slight twist.. And well all of this shows that even the movie industry is running out of good ideas if they are having to reboot and remake old movies..</div></div><hr />

It means that because the new 675 garrison mission rewards an item that gives GR, rather than rewarding the GR currency directly, you can't benefit from Scavenger trait. It's a rare mission too, so I doubt Blizzard will remove the regular GR missions.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, it looks to be a means of sending GR to your alts so they're not crying poverty while your main has no use for GR (beyond the Trading Post).</div></div><hr />

That's all I need for this patch to go from 'cool until I've finished the story' to 'hope regained'. Hopefully it's not TOO rare, though. Even with 10 characters the Arrakoa token mission doesn't show up that frequently.</div></div><hr />

They're assuming it because of the achievement change. But it doesn't mean anything. It just leaves them open to do something else and makes it look like they have something else planned to get people excited. The fact that it was originally &quot;final task&quot; tells me this is still the final tier. <br />
Plus, the rings themselves are still Legendary, after being Epic during the entire quest line, which means they're &quot;final&quot;.<br />
<br />
There might be a Chapter V for a small 6.3 patch, but I don't expect it to add another tier. More raid tiers = getting to next item squish faster. There's a storyline plot still hanging after all, assuming Gul'Dan isn't kept around to provide a link into next expansion's threats the way Garrosh was.</div></div><hr />

but it sure sucks that these juicy rewards are from 675 missions which (fresh) alts have little to no hope of completing tbh<br />

they better make it easier/faster for alts to gear up to 660/675 followers<br />

don't worry you can bring your followers to 645 ilvl with 1000 gold for each follower...and if you don't have gold you can always buy a wow token.. You get what I mean right? A f2p design philosophy in a subscription game...gg Blizzard... <br />

ps. in4 white knights tell me how easy is to make 1000g and how they make millions without even playing</div></div><hr />

It's amazing how they just so happened to go back to &quot;gold as the universal currency&quot; at the same time that they started selling gold. GGwp Blizz, wp indeed.</div></div><hr />

nice try blizz, I still make like 4X more per month then what token costs :P so I have spare<br />
<br />
<br />
Ill probably get my more important followers on an alt to 645 with gold, but only some .. no way am I spending that token gold to gear up all of them at 1000g per follower ..</div></div><hr />

Calling it now. IF that Season 3 confirms a 6.3 (or whatever) raid....it is gonna take place on Azeroth and shit is gonna have hit the fan. I really don't see us staying on Draenor unless they miraculously open up the Ogre continent but that would only make sense IF they expand on Cho'gall's master and have all the Ogres answer to it.<br />
<br />
Either way....WoD may have just got a lot more interesting if 6.2 really isn't the final raid like everyone thinks/thought. It is just up to Blizzard to get their shit together and turn this expansion around. We still need more world content of some kind. Raids are well and good but we need stuff to do outside of that. It's kinda sad to see people only log in to raid.<br />
<br />
This.<br />
I log in daily, do my Garrison shit in 10 mins ( cba with mine already ), log out. Wednesday and Sunday, I look forward to. :)<br />

Why is everyone jumping to the conclusion that there will be a third patch just based on another datamined season for PvP? MoP had another season tacked onto it despite not having any content for 14 months. It could just be used as potential filler to keep people distracted while they work on the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Chapter IV: Darkness Incarnate Acquire your legendary ring by completing Khadgar's quests, then finish his final task. 25 points. 25 points.<br />

<br />
<br />
here is the box that blizzard is in...they clearly intended for 6.2 to be the final patch but the development for the next expansion is once again WAY behind schedule and they haven't yet found a way to meet their stated goal / promise of faster content despite WoD having the least content ever...so they are going to have to push out a sunwell and/or a few dungeons to placate the masses due to the delay...but it will be a pretty pathetic effort because 1) 6.2 is already the content hold over patch with the Tanaan Jungle being turned into a glorified Timeless Isle (which is late expansion filler) instead of a zone with real content and 2) if they put any real effort into 6.3 the next expansion will be delayed that much farther pissing off shareholders and players alike (remember their excuse for no new dungeons in 6.2 was the amount of resources it took [and yes I know they claimed it was amount of resources vs relevancy of content but their the people that create the incentives that determine how long content is relevant so that's a pretty poor excuse])<br />
<br />
bottomline 6.2 is either the final patch with another extended content drought or we get a even more half-assed effort in 6.3 and the expansion with the least content ever drags on interminably...its not a pretty picture either way tbh<br />
<br />
Nothing can satisfy your ass, isn't that nice?<br />
Please, mastermind, tell us all here, what does this mean : <br />

She was the one to land the final blow on Illidan in the Black Temple you see the conversation between her and Illidan before she kills him.. http://www.wowwiki.com/Maiev_Shadowsong<br />

But of course she is either still alive and on the run from her brother after kidnapping Malfurion or she is dead, there must be some reason for why the boat named as such but what it is who knows.. lol</div></div><hr />

Please, let us all know, WHAT IS, REAL, CONTENT, to you? Describe, elaborate, and make Blizz scratch their heads when you tell them YOUR idea of what REAL CONTENT is.<br />
<br />
Well...Tanaan Jungle was originally intended to available as a max level zone available at launch and garrisons were supposed to be basically optional and not absolutely necessary to advance in the game...and another promise they made was to add more 5 man dungeons later in the expansion as well as improve expansion launch cycles...<br />
<br />
So lets review<br />
<br />
1) all other late expansion versions of the timeless isle concept were actually basically completely &quot;new&quot; areas provided in addition to other content but now they're using an area intended for another purpose originally for timeless isle 3.0 - that's less content<br />
<br />
2) broken dungeon promises - instead getting mythic dungeons - reusing current assets with the least amount of effort on their part (tuning adjustments basically) - not new content<br />
<br />
3) can't even get to Tanaan Jungle without a garrison (and yes I know they dramatically lowered the garrison resources required). And please lets not forget that adding garrison missions requires the least amount of resources compared to say adding dungeons - which is one reason blizzard likes them - less effort required<br />
<br />
4) not even a hint yet they have an alpha of the next expansion so that's another promise broken<br />
<br />
And if you buy their excuse for adding dungeons - too much resources required (their words) and they bring in another patch they can't spend too many resources on it because it will delay the next expansion further - so one can only imagine how lack lustre it will be<br />
<br />
its pretty obvious to an objective observer that they are 1) shooting from the hip and changing plans on the go based on schedule delays and other issues and 2) they are trying to milk the cow and extend the life of WoD with the least amount of resources possible to avoid further delays.<br />
<br />
There's a big difference between doing garrisons because they are required and actually enjoying them - I do garrisons on 5 alts - not fun tbh and not &quot;real&quot; content...will be interesting to see the subscription numbers on thursday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing that is implied is that we don't kill Gul'Dan (Assuming that was the &quot;final task&quot; in the first place), other than that we still know nothing.<br />
<br />
Well and if Grom Hellscream gets a redemption story or we get to kill him.....<br />
<br />
I kind of hope they do a 6.3 now. As bad a &quot;content&quot; has been in WoD, Blizzard were the ones determined to tell this story of alternative Draenor and the hero's of the past. I'd rather they get it done and finished properly than have another story thread left hanging.</div></div><hr />

The last time I saw Maiev she had delivered the death blow to Illidan in The Black Temple. He told her she was nothing without him and she said that was true, that she was nothing without her pursuit of him. That ship name makes me wonder if Illidan is going to be making an appearance in this expansion.</div></div><hr />

They want to release them faster, but that's going to be because they don't want a 12 month gap between last tier and new expansion. And they say that every time, and then fucking do it anyway.</div></div><hr />

There's a small chance it's just a change so no one thinks Khadgar is going to die from the achievement text, but I don't think they've really cared that much about spoilers in criteria before.</div></div><hr />
