<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2014-06-26, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DK set is rather bland. It would've been better and more lore-friendly if instead they modeled it after the very first generation of deathknights created by Gul'dan who took the souls of Shadow Council Orcs, and placed them into fallen Stormwind Knights. They could've atleast modeled it after Teron gorefiend since he was literally THE first deathknight, WAAY before Arthas. Would've been alot better than generic skulls and icy blue color schemes. But let's just see if mythic looks better, since it did for the originally boring shaman tier.<br />
<br />
Also, Corehound mount sounds badass, but i bet it'll be one of those super exclusive things accessible only to high end raiders, or probably put in the store at this rate.</div></div><hr />

Edit: Guessing it won't be a store mount, unless Core Hounds can fly. Even if it does turn out to be a Store Mount, I will absolutely buy that. Would be the first Store Mount in a while that looked decent to me.</div></div><hr />

As I said before, it's time to change the ppl behind the designs of armors and weapons in this game...They are just disgusting...</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I mean just look at the models and compare them to the more finished ones (Orcs, Gnomes, Dwarves and Tauren male), they have a lot less detail and odd geometry (I mean the human female has pointy thighs).</div></div><hr />

While the neck/back looks descent when looking from the side, the chest is too big/pumped up which makes it look like the model has no throat. They should make the chest a bit smaller to &quot;create&quot; a throat.<br />

No.<br />
My guess is:<br />
Core of iron is tied to tanks ( iron-tanks)<br />
Core of flame is tied to dps (flame-dps)<br />
Core of life is tied to healers (Life-healing class).<br />

You couldn't tell the SOO tier was a DK at first glance? You couldn't tell the ToT set was a DK compared to a paladin or warrior at first glance? You couldn't tell the T14 set was DK when side by side to warrior and paladin, AT FIRST GLANCE? Like, are you kidding me? &quot;Cyclops eyes&quot; each tier? Like, you had 1 so far. Tier 14 is a skull with black roses and very gothic, tier 15 is like a maw, slithering tongues and jagged toothy mouths. Tier 13 was bones and skull theme, Tier 12 was fiery alien bug. I can continue. Did you actually read what you typed before you posted it? You've literally had 2 &quot;bones&quot; (granted, 1 of those (14) was only a skull helm) and 1 &quot;cyclops&quot; themes in the last 9 tiers.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, I was hoping they wouldn't go the same direction they did with the Pandaren (same face with different texture added on top), but it seems my fears came true.<br />

Different texture doesn't make a different face when eyeshape, mouthshape, nose and everything else is exactly the same underneath it.</div></div><hr />

We have been hearing talk about new character models since WotLK and I just cannot sit here in silence without a fair critique. The Draenei male model looks like he ate the treat willy wonka warned not to eat and blew up to a steroid size Fabio looking blueberry. The Undead Male model looks like 2 toothpicks got in a wet paper towel fight and the Hellraiser porcupine won. The Human Female achieved the impossible, a man's ass on a female.

The only thing I don't like is that they reverted back to the whole beach babe model for night elf and human female because it's just unrealistic considering what they do. Especially night elf females. Atleast nelf still has some abs, but they should've kept them looking like Olympian track runners instead of like Victoria's Secret models with Big Brazilian Bootays.<br />
<br />
Also, to all the dum-dums complaining about &quot;same face syndrome&quot;, please remember the rule of thumb that blizzard has even stated in the blue post:<br />
<br />
<br />
I wanted to give you a quick heads up that we‚Äôre expecting some in-progress models to be hitting the Warlords of Draenor alpha test soon. While these will give you an early look at some of the models, please be aware that they aren‚Äôt finished yet. We‚Äôll be presenting final high-quality model captures in future Artcrafts, so stay tuned! <br />
<br />
They've been saying this since the beginning, and all those screenshots weren't showing off the different faces, but rather the accessories for them (i.e. face paint/color for night elves, hair and scars for draenei, and undead shouldn't need explaining).<br />

It's subjective and all, but are you saying you'd rather keep that N64 poopoo face? I mean, you can just by turning new character models off, but i'd say you're missing out. Same goes with anyone else who seems to hate the new (in-progress) models . /shrug</div></div><hr />

Dude, its a game not a female body builder contest. The model is perfect, this is not one of those MMO with unnatural female bodies with almost naked armor......almost</div></div><hr />

I'm liking the male draenei model thus far but it's clearly not finished the facial hair looks awful.<br />
<br />
That's the really terrible facial hair they sprung on us by surprise a few years back. Yes I'm still bitter about it because I logged in one day and my paladin had it. Awful. At least the mustache and hair match now, I guess.</div></div><hr />

Male Draenei need slightly longer necks. They look like they're constantly shrugging.<br />

Or maybe they're shoulders are just way too broad. idk. something about them just doesn't look right.</div></div><hr />

I think you and 99% of the ppl in this thread have wasted their time posting their thoughts, because they obviously missed the artcraft about the human female model. This Alpha build has new faces and textures, but OLD models. Same goes for the Draenei male and NElf female.<br />
<br />
This is what it's going to look when they implement the actual model.<br />

The Human Female has an extremely small head, the old body, and bad texture.<br />
The Draenei Male was shortened (looks squashed), widened, and given an extremely small head.<br />
The Night Elf Female has a unibrow from hell, and as well, has a very small head.<br />
