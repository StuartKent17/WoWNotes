May 20-June 1<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Stationary ground effects should no longer move with the casting character if he or she moves (or is moved) from his or her current location.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warlock) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1125-Warlock-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
It is no longer possible under specific circumstances for players to keep the buff from the now-defunct Improved Demonic Tactics talent.<br />
Glyph of Imp should not be increasing the spell damage of all warlock pets by 20%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Blackwing Descent<br />
<br />
Maloriak now prefers to cast Flash Freeze on caster targets more than 15 yards away. Tank-specialized characters are not targeted, but Flash Freeze can chain onto them. If all the characters in the raid stack up within 15 yards of the boss, they can be hit by Flash Freeze.<br />
<br />
<br />
Throne of the Tides<br />
<br />
Unstable Corruptions now award much less experience when killed on normal difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zul’Gurub<br />
<br />
Shadows of Hakkar can no longer be reflected or deflected.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Archaeology<br />
<br />
The Bountiful Bags guild perk should no longer sometimes incorrectly reward Archaeologists with multiple keystones from dig sites.<br />
<br />
<br />
Skinning<br />
<br />
Players can no longer continue gaining Skinning skill points using low-level creatures below the intended skill threshold.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Arenas<br />
<br />
It should no longer be possible under specific conditions for the Matchmaking Value shown at the end of an Arena match to be incorrect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
Several changes have been made to Battleground queuing to improve the flow for those who queue for random Battlegrounds versus those who queue for specific ones.<br />
The ability for players to retain a second queue for a Battleground after they’ve already entered one has been removed. Previously, players were able to queue for two Battlegrounds, have one queue pop and retain their second queue while they decided if they wanted to join the one that was ready. This is no longer the case. When a Battleground queue pops players will automatically be removed from all other active queues. To queue for a different Battleground it will be necessary to finish the match and queue again. This solves a design issue in that the old system gave players an opening to abandon their teammates if things weren’t going as well as they’d hoped; and it also solves some queue system inconsistencies that were being caused as a side effect of how the old system functioned.<br />
<br />
<br />
Races<br />
<br />
The goblin racial Best Deals Anywhere should now only be applying to vendors with associated reputations. It no longer incorrectly applies to vendors with no attached reputations, nor does it apply to flight path costs. (Note: the displayed costs for flight paths require a client-side patch to update and are not currently reflecting this racial change). In addition, it is no longer possible for goblin characters exalted with their guild to receive an extra discount on top of the exalted faction discount from guild vendors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests &amp; Creatures<br />
Gilneas<br />
<br />
Genn Greymane should now always correctly enter The Battle for Gilneas City, ensuring the event won’t sometimes stall during the final phase.</div></div><hr />

This means you can no longer get that discount, which is kind of crappy. If this behavior wasn't intended they should have said something at the start, just because there's no faction doesn't mean the goblin wouldn't haggle the person down, its common sense. <br />

<br />
Yep, and according to the hotfix notes and the people on the bug report forum, people doing this were actually breaking the queues for other people, causing the infamous &quot;endless queue&quot; problem (I waited 25+ minutes once when the queue said 2 minutes. Dropped queue, requeued, and it popped within 15 seconds.).<br />
<br />
It is a small price to pay to fix this problem.</div></div><hr />

I'm always exalted with factions , i racechanged because of that extra part you can not get exalted with normally since i'm a big collector of insanely overpriced crap (and not a mindless goldfarmer) and it would help. Sad part is i helped a lot of people with buying cheap parts for a dragon free of charge, and was saving still for myself and now got screwed 6k, since it's a hotfix so i can't even borrow gold to buy it now :( :( :( It's a definately nerf and this starts to becoming less and less an enjoying game, where all good stuff is taken away instead of helping us with more bagspace, bankspace, dropdown menu's for collectibles like tabards etc. It's a game, we should be able to enjoy stuff, the last thing we need is changes that make all the goldsellers jump with joy. I really liked this game, i have 2 accounts and play it daily, but it's getting harder and harder to enjoy with unneccesary changes to things people like (removing mounts, pets, keys, racials, quests etc.) in stead of making game play more enjoyable for those who do care about the whole game , the sets , the funitems, instead of those only going for endboss bis loot.</div></div><hr />

Always receive the best possible gold discount, regardless of faction. That does mean it isn't always possible to get a gold discount. It also says regardless of faction which probably means you get it from people who have a faction.</div></div><hr />

Pronoun agreement. In this case, the pronouns are him/her and he/she, and they refer back to &quot;the casting character&quot; which is singular. Therefore, the pronoun cannot be &quot;they&quot; because that is plural.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Akhran</div><div class="date">2011-06-02, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they should leave some bugs left in the game as it makes it more fun. Like really who cares that Archy was dropping extra fragments. Maybe it would make people use Archy a little more. For me it actually almost made Archy tolerable and helped bring the prices on on the tablets come down a bit. It's interesting how Blizz wants to make the game more fun but the things that make it the most fun they take out. A really good example is being able to kite mobs into cities. In TBC it was so fun watching huge monsters be pulled into Shat and all the npcs ravage on them. One of the main things that made me want to buy the game was when I was on a trial account just before BC came out and all the world bosses started attacking the major cities. I saw Kazzak at the gates of IF and was instantly like &quot;OMG this is intense&quot;, also Lethon was attacking SW eating up all the lowbies regenerating his health. These are the type of things they need to bring back into the game. World events, not zoned events. Also Halaa style world PvP. Have TB where Alliance or Horde could take it at any time and only those that control it can enter the instance or do the dailys. Take out the 15 minute despawn and lock out. Say the sides turn before you get to hand in your quest, then fight to get your quest givers back. If you are in the raid when sides switch nothing happens you can still complete the instance, but you cannot enter while the other side controls the area so make sure you dont wipe. It's not like the raid is hard and there's extremely few times you'll be in a group without both a shammy and a lock, if you dont have either, make sure you dont wipe.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, just get over it. It's still better than nothing, and still better than some of the other racials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As in no longer reward? Or no longer gives too few or too many sometimes? Could they be any more vague :D<br />
<br />
My guess is that keystones from B.B. never was intended as the tooltip says nothing about keystones.</div></div><hr />

The Bountiful Bags guild perk should no longer sometimes incorrectly reward Archaeologists with multiple keystones from dig sites.<br />

Now they go ahead and reduce the keystones you get, yeah, that makes it definately more fun. I love GRINDING out the levels of Archaeology, it's so fun now as it is. I'd hate to see it get EASIER and MORE REWARDING.<br />

Also, like others have said before me, the problem with the goblin racial not working with non-rep people is that IT HAS BEEN ACTIVE FOR OVER 6 MONTHS! It's not a bug but a way of life by now. It was so dumb of them to remove this now but it is like Blizzard to take half a year to get around to doing anything about anything. I just hate to see people have to spend extra money now that was once, as everyone assumed, working as intended.<br />

<br />
Glyph of Imp should not be increasing the spell damage of all warlock pets by 20%.<br />
<br />
like seriously? idk what causes this, programmers dazing off, a &quot;bug&quot; (its hard for me to imagine this as im not a programmer. i know its not as simple as pet damage = x)<br />
<br />
but these kind of potentially huge bugs just make me sick. like before when hunters could bug it and maintain 2 aspects. this kind of shit should not be happening. at one point elemental shamans were not getting the debuff off sindragosa back in the day. like, wtf did that come from. and just the spec, not the entire class. wtf is the code for that error.<br />
<br />
just the point of view of an ignorant whiner.</div></div><hr />

Nothing can be done in this game without some group of people &quot;justifying&quot; the reason that it makes the game unplayable, no matter how benign it is. Then again, I'm just stating the obvious...</div></div><hr />

If people play with an ability one way for 6 months then it gets randomly changed, then yes, they're going to complain and rightfully so. What is the point of a racial ability that does nothing? (Once you're exalted with pretty much everything then your racial is completely wasted. When you could get a discount on nonrep vendors that was the whole point of it.)</div></div><hr />

No, it means things that are grey for skinning won't give skill ups, not that grey mobs (level-wise) won't give skills appropriately.</div></div><hr />

Oh my god, lets go hotfix this now, it's a game breaking!!!<br />

Game. Seriously who cares about some players spending less money than others players, in a GAME?<br />
Did they have to make a racial useless for this?<br />
<br />
Or virtual money is serious business.<br />
