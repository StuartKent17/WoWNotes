<br />
We can now fairly assume that the item is needed by NPCs on the encounter, which means we won't get the stats of the off-hand anytime soon. <br />
The stats on this one are real, because the itemID is the same as the one used in the player set (included in the game files).</div></div><hr />

Try pulling it today on both servers. See what happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right, but part of the question was &quot;did nihilum actually get it?&quot; even though you saw it as curse was fighting Illidan. What my theory is would be that it's a drop off the actual warglaives themselves (the mob). Totally a hunch, but I'm curious what happens either of the weapons are pulled on either realm ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't think the actual glaives are to be dropped, perhaps you will have to go through a long enough questline to finally get them, just like the other legendaries.<br />
<br />
Maybe the quest item can be disarmed from that mob? ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Often people make a confusion: there the 2 warglaive's of azzinoth that are 2 separate items...and there is the Twin Blades of Azzinoth wich is a craft-unique item that is made from combining the 2 warglaives...only available for GM's at least it was when i played wow.<br />
<br />
The 2 warglaives can be dropped by Illidan in the Black temple but that it's a small chance...and the Twin Blades item is available only to GM's in GM Island.<br />
<br />
The item is available for sale at the NPC Julia Gallina in the Gallina Winery but again only GM's can buy it.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it still is that way but when i played it was like this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkspells</div><div class="date">2007-07-27, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm really confused, could someone please fill me in?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What was it Boub, 2 Main Hand Drops from 25 kills? <br />
Thats not bad at all, not great but still.<br />
<br />
Why you can see them is because (like in the Eye) you have to fight the weapons, save that the blades are a bit different. They summon two Elementals (Now I see why you can get a bunch of FR Gear from doing Heroics, its either for that or that Astromancer boss in Heroic Mech :P)<br />
<br />
Anywho, I don't think we've seen the Off-Hand drop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the game files back in the day, there was a &quot;Warglaive of Azzinoth&quot; a 2 handed weapon, when used it split into two, was Artifact quality but never put ingame, some people say its a GM weapon.<br />
<br />
The Twin Blades of Azzinoth are the real thing, they are in the game, legendary quality, the main hand drops off Illidan but no one has seen the Offhand drop yet, for all we know the Main Hand could start a questline with random NPC #463 in some zone allowing you to get the offhand.</div></div><hr />
