Warlords of Draenor Garrisons - Inn and Tavern<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Inn and Tavern building (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/36-lunarfall-inn#related:buildings) in the garrison. Currently only the first two tiers are accessible on beta until you earn the Stay Awhile and Listen (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/9703-stay-awhile-and-listen) achievement and unlock the Level 3 Blueprint. <br />
<br />
The Inn/Tavern (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/36-lunarfall-inn#related:buildings) take up a Medium plot which can also be used for a Barn (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/133-barn), Gladiator's Sanctum (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/161-gladiators-sanctum), Lumber Mill (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/138-lumber-mill) or Trading Post (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/145-trading-post). Once upgraded to Tier 3, your garrison will have two Medium plots available. <br />
<br />
Abilities<br />
This building is good for earning more followers, novelty items from the daily quests, and gold from the Treasure Hunt missions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Level 1 - Each day, a visitor offering a dungeon quest with generous rewards will spend the day at your inn. <br />
Level 2 - Recruits random followers each week. You can specify traits and abilities you're especially interested in. <br />
Level 3 - Unlocks the particularly lucrative Treasure Hunt missions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Follower Recruitment<br />
Once a week you can select a follower with a trait or ability that you are interested in to recruit. You are then offered a choice of three followers. <br />

Warlords of Draenor - Dev Interview<br />
Icy Veins (http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/6797-warlords-of-draenor-interview-with-tom-chilton/) had the chance to talk to Tom Chilton at Gamescom. You can find the full interview transcript on their site.<br />

The team hoped to have Warlords of Draenor released a few months ago, but scaling up the team by almost 50% slowed things down.<br />
Zones are already in production for the next expansion, so things should finally be better moving forward.<br />
If more people start doing challenge mode dungeons then challenge mode raids would be something to consider. The team has to be careful not to spend too much time on content that isn't ever seen by most players. <br />
One idea that came up was to make both Northrend and Outland a level 60 to 80 zones at half of their current speed and then allowing players to pick one to level through. Making this change would be fairly time consuming, so it is just an idea for now.<br />
After the new character model revamp is done, adding physics and improving the look and feel of combat are options.<br />

Upgrade your Launcher to Battle.net Desktop App!<br />
As we had previously announced (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/14568367), an upgrade has been on the way for all World of Warcraft launchers to change to the Battle.net desktop app. We’re excited to say that it is finally the time and that as of today, players will begin automatically upgrading to the Battle.net Launcher!<br />
<br />
To read about all the new things which the Launcher offers, check out our desktop app features blog here. We also have a wallpaper you can enjoy by downloading it here (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/media/wallpapers/other?view=battle-net)!<br />
<br />
We also prepared an FAQ (https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/battlenet-desktop-application) in case you have any questions during the transition.<br />
<br />
We’ll see you online!<br />

Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
For PVE DPS, you'd never take a piece of gear with Vers on it as a pure DPS. It's a worthless stat.<br />
By &quot;never&quot;, you mean &quot;only when it's on a higher ilvl piece, or you value significant DR over slight dps loss.&quot; (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/502546157248081920))<br />

What's the intended number of healers for Mythic? 3-4, 4-5, or 5-6?<br />
5, though 4 or 6 on some fights is something I expect to see. If we see 3 or 7, we'd consider that a tuning error on our part. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/501884520862212096))<br />

Will mythic in 6.0 revert to same-server players only? Not sure because of the systems changes coming for raids to prep for WoD.<br />

<br />
I don't get this at all. Why is this a major pita? The experience requirements have been nerfed over and over and over again. It most likely took longer to level to 60 in Vanilla, 70 in TBC and 80 in WotLK than it is to level to 100 in WoD.<br />

<br />
I really, really like this idea. I would love to spend more time in either place while leveling; just got my goblin DK to Northrend (god knows how many DKs I've rolled, this is the first I've ever played long enough to get past Outland), and it felt like I only scratched the surface of Outland while playing through with her. I'll spend a bit more time in Northrend, as I have to hit 80 to move on to Cata. The amount of retuning necessary would be a huge amount of work, so I can see why they wouldn't follow through on it. How would they handle dungeons? Would there now be two sets of dungeons from 60-80? Would Hellfire Ramparts and Utgarde Keep be the same level? If I choose to level through BC, would I be queuing up for any of these dungeons, or would I stick with just BC ones? It'd be too much work to iron all these issues out, but I frankly would love to see how they could tackle them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it's true for any qualified job, especially when teamwork is involved, it does seem rather intuitive, I never quite understood how some people could think a workload can be scaled linearly.<br />
<br />
Software development (like, actual engineering, not automata-level-CMS-stuff) on very large projects satisfies both very specific training requirements (need to understand the home-made framework, their context, the culture behind it) and team synergy. If the new people don't blend in organically, that's not just bad at first, it can get pretty terrible down the road.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually, as someone who's been in the code development business for more then 15 years, those statements are only true if you're talking about adding, new, fresh out of college developers, any average programmer with more then 10 years in the field will take about 1-3 weeks to become productive. (heck i know of quite a few instances where a developer of this experience was fixing problems on his first day of work).<br />
<br />
the two problems with hiring this type of people are that<br />
a. they cost a lot more then your fresh from college worker. (and if they're good at what they do, you'll usually have to lure them off from their position, such people are seldom unemployed)<br />
b. you need someone qualified (read, not your average HR person) to evaluate and hire them (most very experienced developers will react poorly to some HR type reading from a list of pre-prepared questions they went past 5 years ago)<br />
<br />
and just to clarify, unless blizzard are coding in a super unique never heard of before variation of computer code. it should be obvious to a veteran programmer what a code segment does, the potential pitfalls, and if he's better then average he'll even be able to overcome lack of design documentation or code comments.</div></div><hr />

The Titan people were switched over in MoP. I'd say these are new hires, but if you check Blizzard's job opportunities most require at least 3 years experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Holy fucking crappola,... awesome! After all these years, dynamic shadows AND physics? <br />
But most of all, the look and feel of combat has me excited. I love this game and would love new reasons to play it, and this has always been an area I've felt could do it without making the game<br />
a new game. <br />
<br />
Wildstar has optional elements, I could see Blizzard doing it too. Frankly if Tera had WOW's characters and World and zone flow and lore and gameplay but with Tera's basic combat system, it would be my perfect game. I don't expect that to happen here, but anything approaching Blizzard making the combat more visceral and solid and more impactful will be great. Diablo 3 and Heroes of the Storm has combat that feels amazing, like slamming into stone and metal, ripping through flesh with tides of viscera pouring and splattering, shooting across the ground with your blade dragging through your targets like a bolt of lightning. <br />
<br />
Yummy.</div></div><hr />

True. But of course not every new employee is coder. You have artists, animators, designers and so on. And if you hire, let's say 20, new artists and tell them to start working on few sets or zones and they have never been working on WoW before you can just imagine what kind of mess they'll make. And since Blizzard uses in-house engine it can take a while to teach all the nuances to new people.</div></div><hr />

And yeah, training does take time and does delay absolutely insanely huge projects like wow.<br />
<br />
Let's remember this for later patches in WoD and the next expansion. Those should be finished quite fast when 30% of their team is trained.<br />

I mean, you pass Outland in a few hours currently, and Northrend isn't much slower. This can't be too troublesome for anybody that's honest to themselves. :P I think it's even rather enjoyable since the increased xp gains make you able to more freely choose what zones to do. Either stay and do 2-3 zones, or do a few questlines in each.</div></div><hr />

(heck i know of quite a few instances where a developer of this experience was fixing problems on his first day of work).<br />
[...]<br />
and just to clarify, unless blizzard are coding in a super unique never heard of before variation of computer code. it should be obvious to a veteran programmer what a code segment does, the potential pitfalls, and if he's better then average he'll even be able to overcome lack of design documentation or code comments.<br />
<br />
That doesn't hold up for very large projects running for 15 years with entire cohorts of people working on it.<br />
Experience will obviously lessen the requirements, not remove them. Depending on the complexity of the project's codebase it will still be a relatively difficult maneuver, especially so with as high a proportion as 50%, like stated.<br />
<br />
There is a big difference between a new developer that is able to help right away, and one that is completely involved into the development. You can take any random developer and make it produce useable code given clear-cut and well chosen boundaries ; if he/she has to delve more deeply and participate actively in the design, or develop more critical components, it takes time. I'm pretty certain that WoW's codebase is not the typical copy/paste e-commerce platform with a somewhat standard implementation of whatever frameworks you're used to.</div></div><hr />

Short term loss meaning over a year of SoO and subscription losses? Not sure if it's worth it.<br />

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Brooks' law is a claim about software project management<br />
<br />
The first point is to note that Brooks' law often applies to projects that are already late. Projects can be brought back into (or kept in) control if people are added earlier in the process. It is also important to determine if the project is really late, or if the schedule was originally overly optimistic<br />
<br />
The quantity, quality and role of the people added to the project also must be taken into consideration. One simple way to circumvent the law on an overrun project is to add more people than needed, in such a way that the extra capacity compensates the training and communication overhead. Good programmers or specialists can be added with less overhead for training. People can be added to do other tasks related with the project, for example, quality assurance or documentation; given that the task is clear, ramp up time is minimized<br />
<br />
If you want to be &quot;sensible&quot; you should probably read your own source, it is not an established &quot;law&quot; because it's simply called &quot;XYZ's law&quot;, and it contradicts itself in several areas, it could indeed be the reason but you are trying to make it cut and dry with &quot;guise it's XYZ law /end&quot;, when that simply isn't true.<br />
<br />
In one of Blizzards own videos, the round table or whatever it was called, I believe the second one, they flat out say &quot;We looked at features like Garrisons and thought we could do better, so we started again from scratch&quot; so which excuse is the real one hmm, some crappy bs about staff, or because they restarted major features of the expansion in the beta? I have no problems with delays if it creates a superior product, but Blizzard flat out lies about reasons sometimes and thinks people are dumb, THAT is the problem, if they were actually transparent I'd respect them a whole lot more, treating your customer on the same level goes a long way.</div></div><hr />

I have to be super careful here. See, for years I went on and on about how much I wished they'd redo the old world so we could fly there. Then they did and I loved it! But it seems most people didn't. <br />
<br />
Well, for the same amount of time, basically since I first heard about the PhysX physics accelerator that was going to be like the early 3D accelerators (kids: You used to have to buy a separate card to have rad graphics and colored lighting in your Quake FPS games. Get off my lawn.) I've been super excited for them to add Physics to the game. <br />
<br />
Now, I never thought they'd add it to the current incarnation of WoW. I assumed it'd be WoW 2.0 or something. And I want to make it super clear that I'm not advocating for any kind of BS twitch game like people have tried to make where you play with a gd console controller and &quot;dodge&quot; out of the way, which is what I'm afraid this'll end up being. <br />
<br />
No, I want things like gravity. I want downhill racing. I want StarSiege tribes-like &quot;skiing&quot;. I want lava that bubbles and rivers that flow and have currents. I want 3D dungeons with traps and Portal-like things, stuff like that. I want explosive shot to include a napalm-like burst which spatters on my enemies. I still want flying mounts but I also want air currents... I want weather. I want inertia and momentum. <br />
<br />
But I'm weird like that. I also want the day/night cycle to not follow that of Earth, and I want NPCs to go to other places at night - some to the Inn/Bar, some home (not available) and I want new/different NPCs to come out at night. <br />

If they're already working on Zones for 7.0, I'm happy to keep playing with nothing new for a month (or so, till 6.0)., knowing this is going to (hopefully) be the last year-long stretch of nothingness. <br />

<br />
Only a child with no work experience would say that. If they really did increase their staff by 50% in the last year, it certainly would slow them down A LOT<br />
<br />
WOW uses a proprietary program to create WOW. It is a huge program and everything is done directly in that one engine. Anyone they hire would have 0 experience using that program, and would probably takes weeks or months to even get a grasp of how it all works, and probably at least for the first few weeks, there would have to be someone teaching them.... and then for months and months after that, anything they produce (slowly) would have to have to have a supervisor giving a lot of feedback.<br />
<br />
It is the reason companies like Microsoft and Google begin to fail after they get too big.. because the guys with talent and ambition end up spending all their time teaching and managing and not actually producing product. It is probably what has been happening the past year. All the guys who really know the WOW engine were not actually producing anything, but instead teaching all the new hires how to use the engine.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't get this at all. Why is this a major pita? The experience requirements have been nerfed over and over and over again. It most likely took longer to level to 60 in Vanilla, 70 in TBC and 80 in WotLK than it is to level to 100 in WoD.<br />
<br />
And if you want you can just finish Outland/Northrend.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, they can, and will continue to nerf the EXP requirements to get to 100.. But the problem is that it is breaking the immersion of the game from 1-80. Already you really cannot level through a 1-60 zone without ending up with grey quests for the last 1/3 of a zone. While most of us certainly could care less about ´finishing´a zone, it is bad game design the way the game is set up now.<br />
<br />
For me, I would love if they would overlap Outlands and WOTLK so that you could do either. Despite having 11 lvl 90s now, only my main has seen anything but 2-3 zones in either expansion. It would be nice to be able to use all those zones for real experience. But right now, all of my alts have done Hellfire and Nagrand, and really nothing else in BC because they hit lvl 78 so quickly and can go to Northrend where the exp is much better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things like the thunder king fight show they can add ´physics´ like behavior to the current engine. They also did some things with inertia and the joust event in Cata.<br />
<br />
But there are a million things that could be called game ´physics´ and I hope half of them are never implemented. Having every river slowly move you downstream for no real purpose is just annoying.</div></div><hr />

One idea that came up was to make both Northrend and Outland a level 60 to 80 zones at half of their current speed and then allowing players to pick one to level through. Making this change would be fairly time consuming, so it is just an idea for now.<br />
<br />
I love Outland AND Northrend. The Cataclysm zones far less, but at least the portals are useful. I would much rather skip Pandaria altogether.<br />
<br />
Although if Blizzard did go through with the idea, I really hope that only the exp. required for those zones would be affected. The redesigning of Old Azeroth was a complete tragedy.</div></div><hr />

They also did some things with inertia and the joust event in Cata.<br />
<br />
But there are a million things that could be called game ´physics´ and I hope half of them are never implemented. Having every river slowly move you downstream for no real purpose is just annoying.<br />
<br />
Maybe, but having to use a bridge to cross a raging river would be kinda cool. Would also make flying mounts much more valuable. And yeah there's physics in some of the encounters, but there's nothing like standing on a slope, jumping once, and then holding spacebar to start skiing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_tYMRyaj8s</div></div><hr />

This is interesting. I had a similar idea to this except my thought were to make unpopular zones like Netherstorm and Shadowmoon Valley (who really sticks around in Outland long enough to need to quest in these zones?) scaled down to become alternative starting zones. Yes it would take a lot of work and revamping, but it would give those who, like me, are sick of Hellfire Peninsula a somewhat fresh alternative when leveling alts.<br />
<br />
This also spawned another idea in my head: why not make challenge zones? Designed specifically for those decked out in full heirloom gear, these zones offer a more fluid leveling experience and buffed creatures that might actually pose as a challenge for these targeted players. In these zones, the player would not likely find their quest log full of green quests 3 levels lower than them. The zones would feature 2 to 3 mini bosses tied to quests that have unique battle mechanics somewhat on the level of mild brawler's guild bosses. Quest rewards would only reward off pieces (slots other than what you could get with heirloom) as well as unique transmog gear and toys.<br />
<br />
I know blizz is mostly focused on end-game content, but as a player starting fresh on a new server, even with heirloom gear, I find my leveling experience dull and boring. Currently the only alternatives to questing are BGs and faceroll dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Nah, I would've done different, during the Cataclysm when they changed the quests and the entire desing of the zones I would make possible to level from 1 to 85 in Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdons, I would close the Dark Portal and shut down the Zepplyn services to Northrend and put portals in Caverns of Time to these two areas (It would make much more sense lorewise), then we would have two choices to level from 60 to 80...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mykro9</div><div class="date">2014-08-28, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My biggest problem with the zone/expansion flow is when I hit 60/70/80/85 mid quest, and the mob XP goes from 100 per kill to 10. I understand that they want us to move on to the new zones, but a lvl 68 mob in SMV should have the same HP and XP values as a lvl 68 mob in Borean Tundra, and if I want to stay in SMV and kill lvl 68 stuff, it should move my XP bar as much as in Borean Tundra. Ironically, I can sit in one place and do pet battles through 3 lvl's and the percentage of my XP bar stays the same as I gain lvl's. I literally have sat and killed the same 7 golden civets in the Vale by the Beast of Fable No-No and gone from 87 to 90 in like 3-4 hours AND lvl'ed a TON of pets.</div></div><hr />

Unlurking...<br />
<br />
And, everyone is focusing on the drag of getting new team members up to speed, which is a known phenomenon, but there's also disruption in the existing team, and there can be a lot of drama and such from prima donnas and people having power taken away, or having to share power (new managers and art directors, etc), and, resistance to having to change their methods, workflow and dynamics to use a bigger team. That's also a VERY well known phenomenon, and one I've seen personally as a graphics professional of over 20 years. <br />
<br />
I won't name names, but I've smelled prima donna exuding from several department leads at Blizzard. Their art department is VERY small considering the scope of the game, and they are no doubt a very tight knit group who fear change. Like hiring a girl artist. :) (They are pretty much a sausage party). Throwing new conceptual artists, and new artists for texturing, modeling, and gear design is no doubt something that takes a lot of reorganizing, and getting people to work in the Blizzard &quot;style&quot; and learning the workflow, but when you have some higher ups or veterans throwing monkey wrenches into the works because they're upset, that can slow down if not put on the brakes on a project instantly. I suspect this is part of their problem, along with mis-management, the turmoil from taking Titan away and moving all of them back (just the office logistics alone were probably a nightmare - take building with 1000 people, and this building with 800, merge smoothly and not interrupt the work. Good luck!), and some pretty high ranking people leaving, and the turmoil that causes...yeah, I kind of think Blizzard might have been a challenging place to work the last year or so.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like a big waste of time.<br />

What the fuck are you even talking about. How does this have any relevance to the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to stab whoever wrote this in the eyeball and slowly twist the knife. The mechanic wasn't &quot;cool&quot;...it was just clunky. Blizzard does something to update the most prehistoric class in this fucking game and idiots like this guy go and complain. I hate people who think that wholly embracing every terribly-designed mechanic makes the &quot;leet&quot; or something.</div></div><hr />
