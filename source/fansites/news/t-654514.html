Patch 3.2 BOP Items Trade<br />
A very nice feature was added to the game with the latest PTR patch, according to the interface files and a few in-game tests you can now trade BOP items with members of your raid who participated in the kill. This change will probably considerably lower the amount of GM petitions each day. <br />
<br />
BIND_TRADE_TIME_REMAINING = &quot;You may trade this item with players that were also eligible to loot this item for the next %s.&quot;; -- Time remaining to trade a bound item. Example: You may trade this item with players that were eligible to loot this item for the next 1 hour 30 minutes.<br />
<br />

They evolve in appearance. They're essentially season 5 sets, but with each season, more things get added on to the outfits such as glowing effects and additional armor details on top of the previous look of the set.<br />
<br />
Neat concept.</div></div><hr />

But all considered... it probably will be limited to the unorganized raidgroups.</div></div><hr />

Guilds're gonna know if a person who didn't win an item is suddenly using it; I'm sure most guilds'll quickly come up with a solution to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This change will probably make off-tier gear more wanted, as you you now get the option to give it away if you get the tier item you really wanted. given ofcourse that your guild is clearing pretty fast</div></div><hr />

Also with the Item Trading thing, I hope they aren't eligible for anyone under the same raid id, IE they HAD to be there for the kill, otherwise the market would be all over the shop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Priest set /drool <br />
<br />
<br />
A shaman should never ever wear pants!<br />
<br />
Theres a reason that the helm hides the face, as a shaman will never be able to show his face in public wearing this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For some reason I think of the priest set as a BDSM secret cult uniform O_o<br />
<br />
Edit: added mage and warlocks to my Awesome list.<br />
Edit2:<br />
Shaman set looks like a mix of Ulduar Tecnology with Ice. I dont like it anyway.</div></div><hr />

I remember it being the same spiky collar like the previous set, but with 2 big &quot;spikes&quot; or whatever I could call them, going down over the chest. Looked pretty good tbh.<br />

&lt;9.5 Vanq Shoulders Drop&gt;<br />
DK rolls, gets a 55.<br />
Rogue rolls, gets an 82.<br />
DK's friend, a mage, rolls, gets an 87.<br />
Mage doesn't need so much, trades to his DK buddy.<br />
<br />
That's exactly what could happen today... the only difference atm would be the mage having to create a GM ticket and make his lolknight buddy get the shoulders mailed.<br />

If you don't want to be cheated with loot, don't PUG.</div></div><hr />

i would say cut the plans for 3.2 as it is now, go back to drawing table and make a patch worthy of the name of wow.</div></div><hr />

You will probably only be able to trade it to people who was present during the kill itself anyways. No selling or giving to friends / alts will work. ONLY people present during the kill. Of course you could trade it to a friend who was present, but whatever.</div></div><hr />

Probably, but as long as it remains in the time limit. There's a 2 hour limit. Once that runs out, it becomes soulbound.</div></div><hr />

This change will probably make off-tier gear more wanted, as you you now get the option to give it away if you get the tier item you really wanted. given ofcourse that your guild is clearing pretty fast<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless they make it so it's automatically bound if you equip it; after all, it's not a screw-up if you intend to use the item, is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't think it'll matter if you equip it or not. You know the two hour buy-back thingy when you buy something from an emblem vendor? You can equip it, yet return it. The item will always say &quot;Soulbound&quot; but as long as the blue text remains, you can trade it - and it will stay even if you equip it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you look at each season sequentially I think it's really a great sign that the designers use each previous season to build upon the next one, keeping its core components while adding new effects and patterns.</div></div><hr />

&lt;9.5 Vanq Shoulders Drop&gt;<br />

Rogue rolls, gets an 82.<br />
DK's friend, a mage, rolls, gets an 87.<br />
Mage doesn't need so much, trades to his DK buddy.<br />

<br />
My thoughts exactly, but we'll see how it pans out.<br />

Also after seeing these arena sets I'm 99% confident that the 3 plate sets posted the other day weren't T9, because these are actually good and blow those out of the water, so they must have been placeholders or offset pieces.</div></div><hr />

About the BOP trading, i think it will be very good. On guild raids the masterlooter can just grab everything and take care of awarding loot later. I still remember taking 10 minutes to loot Onyxia and having to wait to skin her -_-, but that was a very long time ago.</div></div><hr />

The idea behind this change isn't to change the policy towards loot, but to free up GM time. I know that personally, maybe four out of the six or so petitions I've had direct GM contact with were about loot passing.<br />

as far as the BoP change, it's good. Great for guild raids. For pugs...meh...it's pugs what are gonna do...<br />

I do agree with you. It does seem to happen a lot with the item given to the wrong person. I think that will solve a lot of issues with that, I just hope master looters feel like they can be careless about loot now though.</div></div><hr />

Personally I think it's an amazing idea. My guild runs into 1-3 mislootings a month probably, the GM's probably hate our guild leader lol. You can only give the item to someone who was in the raid while the boss was killed anyways, and if you find yourself in a guild that would make you pay for it, you should leave now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No I completely understand. In ways it is a great idea. I'm not saying my guild itself but I am sure that there are players that are that shady that would do something to that to a fellow guildy/friend. I am sure that it will be a good add to the game. I won a roll last night on an item from KT and it got looted to the wrong person. So I know that It would solve a lot. and not having to wait for a GM to contact you or hoping the other player contacted a GM is also a pulse. You are right there is more positives then there is negatives.</div></div><hr />

As far as the trading BOP items in raid, I think that's a brilliant idea. That way it will cut down on Raid Leader who are in control of the Master Loot, messing up and having to petition the GM's. Wish that was enforce already. I know recently where this could have helped. A couple of guildies who wanted to trade items, one BOP and one BoE, couldn't. The Raid Leader had to petition a GM to switch the items.</div></div><hr />

Five minutes? I think what will be great about it being longer is that you can pass gear along that you had wanted a slight upgrade.. and then, say, try again for tier that drops later.<br />
<br />
Say... SPriest and a Lock roll on shoulders that are good for them both, lock wins.. but the lock really wanted his tier. *gasp* Later boss drops Conq (which NEVER happens! qq).. and lock wins. He can now pass those other shoulders to the priest and everyone is happy... and the other shoulders aren't wasted.<br />
<br />
Everyone has to be there for the kill.. so no selling or passing to randoms. And... if you only have five minutes... well, that could be an afk post-boss kill and then you are stuck with shoulders feeling bad that you replaced them in the same run.</div></div><hr />
