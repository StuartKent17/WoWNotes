Cross-Realm Functionality on RP Realms<br />
Patch 7.0 included some server-side changes to the way our cross-realm and sharding technologies work. While these changes were made to improve system and server performance, they inadvertently affected Role Playing realms and communities in a way we did not intend.<br />
<br />
We recognize the issue this has caused for the role playing community, and have been hard at work on some improvements to our tech that will allow us to disable it entirely in certain areas on RP servers. In those designated areas, players on RP realms will not be automatically mixed with players from other realms, nor will they be split into multiple “shards”. In other words, if you’re on an RP server, you won’t have trouble finding other people from your realm in these areas, and shouldn’t see very many (if any) players from other realms.<br />
<br />
Additionally, it’s worth clarifying that our previous rules which prevented RP realms from being automatically CRZ’ed with non-RP realms have not changed, even outside of these designated areas. However, please be aware that our party-based cross-realm tech is still in place, so if someone from another realm groups up with someone on your realm, you might see them.<br />
<br />
We’re currently applying these changes to Stormwind and Orgrimmar, and North American realms should be starting to see their effects. Realms in other regions will pick the changes up with their next restarts. Once we’ve had some time to see how these changes are working out in action, we’ll begin applying them to other common social hubs (such as other capital cities, Elwynn Forest, etc.), with the goal to eventually roll this out to the vast majority of the game world. The only exceptions will be a few very specific locations where sharding is needed to prevent major performance issues, particularly with the upcoming expansion launch.<br />
<br />
Again, our goal was never to disrupt the role playing community, and we apologize for any distress or confusion this has caused those players.<br />
<br />

New Comic: World of Warcraft: Legion #4 - &quot;Anduin: Son of the Wolf&quot;<br />
Blizzard has released the next Legion comic in the series!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/legionComic4.jpg (http://bit.ly/World-of-Warcraft_Anduin) <br />
<br />
&quot;My son. A terrible darkness has returned to our world.&quot;<br />
<br />
What is the price of peace? This is a question that Anduin Wrynn must answer as war against an ancient foe begins anew and hidden enemies threaten his very life.<br />
<br />
In &quot;Anduin: Son of the Wolf,&quot; a letter from Anduin’s father, King Varian, speaks of ill times ahead, prompting the young ruler to ponder leadership and responsibility. Anduin must face his fears and decide if he can defend Azeroth while still keeping true to his beliefs.<br />
We invite you to read and download the free comic here (https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_entry_media/io/IOBVHZGUWSES1469116501571.pdf). You can also experience the action and sound of this tale through the Madefire motion book (http://bit.ly/World-of-Warcraft_Anduin), available on desktop, mobile, and Apple TV.<br />
<br />

New World of Warcraft Site Preview<br />
As we prepare for a new chapter in Azeroth’s story, we thought it was an auspicious time debut an all-new World of Warcraft site. Consider it your future home for all things WoW, with an all-new home page, game section, new player and returning player guides, and much more.<br />
<br />
As with any new undertaking, this site is a work in progress and we’ll be updating it regularly with a variety of features, including updated player profiles, PvP Ladder information, and more.<br />
<br />
Once the new site goes live on July 26, you’ll also want to check out the updated forums, which can be accessed by clicking Forums at the top of the page. We’ve put a new coat of paint on things and tidied up a bit to give the forums a cleaner look. Don’t worry, though—all of your posts in the current forums will still be here for you when we transition over, so no packing for the move will be necessary.<br />
<br />
Check out the images below to get an idea of how the site will look.<br />
<br />

You mean, the furrys were actually facing distress and confusion over this?<br />
Seeing someone that wasn't from their server had them in a manner of distress?<br />
<br />
And they wonder why people get on those servers and give them hell. rofl<br />

It's more that people on Wyrmrest Accord had to deal with the shit tier roleplayers from Moon Guard being on their server. I'm glad this is getting changed though. Was sick of that garbage being on WrA because of CRZ.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dawnshadow</div><div class="date">2016-07-24, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue with RP realms wasn't just CRZ-- we've had that for years and it was tolerable, although not the ideal solution (there were major issues with players from RP-in-name-only realms griefing world events, which has had a chilling effect on world RP.) It was sharding linked to CRZ that was the problem. You'd have people you were actively playing with just vanish on you. You'd go to meet with someone in your guild and, even though you were both in the same place, you wouldn't be able to see them. <br />
<br />
And the shards were too sparsely populated. Normally popular areas were visibly seemingly abandoned-- you could count the number of people visible in the Trade district last Tuesday on your fingers, and the bars and Cathedral area had only a handful of people in them. Meanwhile, using an RP addon that shows the map positions of other people using the addon, you could also see that the areas were, in fact, very heavily populated-- yet you couldn't find anyone to play with.</div></div><hr />

I've been on both servers for more than a year each, and they're really not that much different from each other.</div></div><hr />

the sword and his father's body were brought back to SW along with the note he wrote to Anduin on the skyfire while on approach to the broken isles.<br />

Whats the deal with the timeline at the end of the comic?<br />
<br />
<br />
it either confirms that through the use of the exodar we go to argus, former homeworld of the draenei, now homeworld of the burning legion and take the fight to them after repelling them from azeroth, or, and this is my own personal speculation, the legion has overwhelmed azeroth and SW/IF have fallen, and the exodar is the last remaining outpost for the free people of azeroth, and this &quot;last chance&quot; may well be something that has the opportunity to win the war on azeroth and save the world from annihilation but comes with a heavy cost, hence why Anduin is slightly hesitant when getting up and issuing the order to execute.</div></div><hr />

I think the Legion and even Sargeras are no more at that point and Andwyn is taking the Exodar and leading the Army of Light to face the Void Lords. Fuck, this could even be the last campaign of Warcraft 4.</div></div><hr />
