Forbes has an interview (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/08/26/warcraft-classic-layering-and-realm-queues-ion-hazzikostas-explains-why-youre-waiting-to-log-in/) with Ion Hazzikostas about layering and launch day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Layering is the lesser of several evils when it comes to handling launch week populations.<br />
Many people have been waiting for this launch for years and are committed to the long haul, but there will also be tons of tourists checking it out at launch.<br />
The team is predicting a fairly steep drop off compared to the interest players are showing on launch day.<br />
Community is very important in Classic, so keeping the number of realms reasonable to ensure a healthy population is important. <br />
The team really really wants to avoid having to offer transfers or merging Classic realms later.<br />
Raising player caps on realms could be done but causes contention for finite spawn points and leads to bottlenecks. <br />
When you log in, you'll be assigned to a layer and will stay there for that gameplay session. <br />
The only way to change layers will be accepting a group invite from a player in another layer. Once you move to that new layer, that'll be your new layer for the gameplay session.<br />
The team expects to aggressively reduce the number of layers after the first few days.<br />
As the team goes into Phase 2, the goal is to have just one layer per realm.<br />
Layers will be removed with realm restarts or during maintenance. <br />
<br />

US and Oceanic - New WoW Classic Realms are Now Open<br />
Due to very high demand, we’ve opened two new WoW Classic realms in this region:<br />
<br />
Ashkandi - Normal - Eastern<br />
Kirtonos - PvP - Eastern<br />
Rattlegore - PvP - Pacific<br />
Kurinnaxx – PvP - Pacific<br />
Kromcrush – PvP – Eastern<br />
Yojamba - PvP - AEST<br />
<br />
We suggest that players choosing a realm consider one of these, as other realms currently marked as “Full” population will experience extended queues.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />
<br />
EU - New WoW Classic Realms Enabled<br />
Due to extremely high demand, we’ve established the following new WoW Classic realms in this region:<br />
<br />
Stonespine – PvP - EN-EU<br />
Noggenfogger – PvP – EN-EU<br />
<br />
We suggest that players choosing a realm consider one of these, as the other realms currently marked as “Full” population will experience queues.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

We also didn't have an unlimited supply of accounts available at day 1. I very clearly recall WoW being sold out in a lot of areas in the first few weeks, mostly because Blizzard didn't expect such a high demand.</div></div><hr />

I know a lot of people do, but not everyone - some people will desperately switch to servers without queues without considering the fact that they'll have a dead server on their hands before long.</div></div><hr />

Server capacity is literally ten times what it was in vanilla. No server is going to be so empty feeling it qualifies as dead unless more than 95% of the people filling it up quit. That will probably happen on full servers because of queue times, but the proportion of people giving up will be smaller on less full realms, and it only has to be a couple percent less before it all balances out.</div></div><hr />

I don't think tourists are sitting in 5 hour queue's, they have nothing to rush for. Maybe the demand for Classic is slightly bigger than Blizzard thought.</div></div><hr />

Say that to tipsout and other #nochanges people LOL<br />
You wanted it, you got it<br />
<br />
Tipsout made a ton of videos about how sharding &quot;is bad&quot; &quot;is not vanilla&quot; ect.... That's why I probably won't ever bother with classic after all, some people of my guild are playing and they have to &quot;queue&quot; to kill npc or get quest items, it's so fun to wait isn't it ?<br />

its 2019 - shame some people didnt notice <br />
<br />
if they wouldnt be so stubborn about fast removal of layering you wouldnt have any ques. <br />
<br />
admit it - the failure lies in fact that streamers were dead set on removal of layering. <br />
<br />
thats the culprit because blizzard admited they have technology to keep much more people online - they just dont want to use it because it would make fast removal of layering impossible</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude. Blizzard have opened up multiple new servers and suggested that people move to them. Multiple times. <br />
<br />
Right now I'm sitting at position 21000 in a queue with an estimated 448 minute wait time, and guess what? I'm not bitching about it because I could easily have fucked off elsewhere but have instead opted for a bit of initial pain in exchange for a populated realm down the line. In the meantime, I'm about to go and be productive because my whole life doesn't revolve around a binary state of either playing WoW or complaining about Blizzard because I can't play WoW immediately. <br />
<br />
The launch has been fantastic. Only a bit of lag at the start, and no major server downtime on my realm at least. <br />
<br />
Genuinely, what's your solution? The way I see it, the only other things they could do besides asking you to roll elsewhere if you're an impatient child would be to stop people rolling on full realms or just let everyone in and pray that the servers don't shit themselves. You would complain about every single one of those options.<br />
<br />
Tl;dr: When will the endless whinging fucking stop? Surely people have to at least take responsibility for problems that they've clearly created for themselves rather than insisting that Blizzard wipe their arses for them whenever anything doesn't go exactly as they imagined it would, despite mountains of evidence that those expectations were never going to be met.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aka, the issues players are currently having should simply be viewed as a necessary evil for a healthy future. <br />
Yet the outcry is severe.<br />
<br />
Yea....in 2-3-4 months we're going to see the crying about dead realms and realms needing to be merged.<br />
<br />
Blizz is 100% right, tourists are checking in and not going to stick around. Populations will drop immensely after a few days.</div></div><hr />

I created a new character in Noggenfogger as soon as it was avaliable. Left my lvl 16 in golemagg. There is a 5K queue in noggenfogger right now too since earlier today. Their solution obviously is not working.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either that, or it's day 2 and being impatient is obviously short-sighted considering how poorly it has gone every time servers are added at launch for the sole reason of getting queue times down.<br />
<br />
Great for day 2, not so great for day 200.</div></div><hr />
