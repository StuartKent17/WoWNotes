Dev Interviews<br />
A few more developers interviews appeared this weekend.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;80&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/trJiscnWZ8c?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Yogscast (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trJiscnWZ8c)<br />
<br />
The Demon Hunter was considered for the Burning Crusade, but the team wasn't ready to add another class to the game at that point.<br />
Distinguishing the Demon Hunter from Monks and Rogues will be important. Rogues are about stealth and crowd control, whereas the Demon Hunter is about in your face mobility and getting out when they are in trouble. Monks are a little more of a hybrid, with some self healing. <br />
The Eye Beam for Demon Hunter is a skillshot, as it is a narrow cone attack. <br />
Dalaran has some modifications for the storyline, changes to the center area, changes to the Underbelly, as well as updated textures.<br />
The current plan is for Dalaran is to have a free for all PvP area in the Underbelly. You can bribe the guards to make them go away for a while.<br />
It would be hard to eliminate existing talent trees, as some players would be upset of the removal of a spec they really liked. If the team could go back in time, there might have been a few that never got added, but now that those trees exist they will try to make them more distinct. <br />
Subtlety Rogues will keep doing down the ninja route, Combat will be a little more like a Pirate Swashbuckler, and Assassination will be about poisons and Damage over Time.<br />
The Honor system is changing from a currency style system to an experience style system. You get benefits from the honor levels such as opportunities to get loot or gold.<br />
The Prestige system will give hardcore players a reason to keep playing, even if their power doesn't increase. <br />
Gear will have less of an impact in PvP. There is no such thing as PvP gear anymore, so no Resilience,PvP specific stats, or sets. Beyond a commonly available item level, you will get drastically diminishing returns from increasing your item level. Somewhere between 5 to 1 and 10 to 1 diminishing returns. The best raider in the game might have a 7% advantage over a player that just hit the level cap.<br />
The team is considering allowing players to transmog their Mists of Pandaria legendary cloak and Warlords legendary ring, as they were available for a limited time. They want to avoid a situation like everyone farming Warglaives for transmog.<br />
It is possible that in a future expansion more races could become Demon Hunters, but for now it is only Blood Elves and Night Elves. <br />
You can use the double jump in battlegrounds and dungeons. The team will be careful to avoid breaking the game with Demon Hunters using double jump current content, such as groups that only want Demon Hunters to skip things in dungeons.<br />
Tanaan is a big and awesome zone with a lot of cool spawns. It has generated a lot of engagement with the player base. There are a lot of players doing it every day. The team wants to continue to evolve the endgame world content model though, as they aren't happy with the combination of daily quests and bonus objectives. They are two pieces of the puzzle, but larger ongoing story development is also important, similar to what was in Patch 5.1. Other mechanics to add more replayability and variation would also be good additions and there are plans for Legion to make better endgame world content. <br />
Gul'dan is the instigator in Legion, but not the big bad guy. He is a raid boss in the raids at launch, but not the final boss of the expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Millenium (http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x30y5is)<br />
<br />
Legion may be shorter than other expansion names, but it describes the expansion perfectly, especially if you understand the context of the word in Warcraft history.<br />
Azeroth is the only world (that we know of) that the Legion hasn't conquered yet. <br />
We will discover the motivations of the Burning Legion. They aren't just going throughout the universe causing chaos.<br />
The Broken Isles has been pretty quiet as of late, until the Tomb of Sargeras was activated. People knew it was there before, but there was no real motivation to go there. <br />
Tension between the Horde and Alliance is an important part of the game and this expansion. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tweakers.net (http://tweakers.net/reviews/4144/2/world-of-warcraft-legion-in-gesprek-met-de-makers-artifacts.html)<br />
<br />
The team hasn't decided if Blacksmiths or Jewelcrafters will be able to make items that modify your Artifact.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
All Druid forms connected with the Artifact weapon will be updated. (Keep in mind this is a translated summary, Moonkin was not specifically mentioned)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion Trademark<br />
It appears that we didn't see the trademark early this time because it wasn't filed until the day of the announcement. Blizzard also trademarked &quot;World of Warcraft Legion&quot; rather than just the expansion name on its own this time.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Rogue Order Hall<br />
Some Rogues were more enthusiastic about Ravenholdt as an Order Hall rather than Dalaran Sewers. <br />
As a rogue, #RavenholdtOrRiot<br />
no riot pls. the feedback has definitely been heard, and is something we'll discuss back at the office (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/630587454341414912))<br />
dalaran sewers has no essence for me as a rogue, im sure others feel the same.<br />
If I call it &quot;a hidden rogues' guild in the Dalaran underground&quot; is that any cooler? Sewer was not the greatest shorthand. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/630602817166815232))<br />
Let me guess: you guys already did put some work into it, right? Don't want to start over?<br />
Or, less cynically, I just want to make sure that feedback isn't being biased by &quot;eww, sewer.&quot; (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/630732442689740800))<br />
&quot;Seedy underground thieves' lair, right under the public's noses&quot; vs &quot;mansion out in the mountains in the middle of nowhere&quot;? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/630603373595615233))<br />
Light's Hope Chapel is just as &quot;middle of nowhere&quot; as Ravenholdt.<br />
It's a strong Rogue theme to be 'hiding right behind you'. Not so much for Paladins. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/630604577499262977))<br />
The fact is, players *aren't* lowly thieves. They are the best of the best. And those folks like mansions!<br />
Who said you were lowly? There are obviously preconceptions here, and any place can be portrayed poorly or greatly with copious use of adjectives with good/bad connotations. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/630633035612844032))<br />
<br />
This is the kind of thing you should put out innocent-looking blog polls for well in advance. A &quot;what location feels most iconic to your class?&quot; blog would tell you exactly where to put them.<br />
That would limit choices to existing locations. What if there's a cooler *new* place? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/630603871405015040))<br />

PvP Gear<br />
What Tom said was that someone wearing the absolute best PvE gear in the game might have a 7% advantage over someone who had just hit level 100 -- and thus, had not collected any gear at all. There was nothing about his statement at all that could be taken as &quot;the best gear for PvP comes from PvE.&quot; I have no idea how you could have gotten that from what he said, unless you're purposefully trying to stir up trouble.<br />
<br />
Our intent -- as it has been for several expansions now, and as it is currently in Warlords -- is for PvP gear to be the best available in PvP. That has not changed in Legion.<br />
<br />
I'm curious how you guys will accomplish that with the complete removal of &quot;pvp gear.&quot; Hopefully more info soon to clarify this gray area.<br />
Yep, definitely something that needs clarifying. At the moment, we're just waiting for developers to get back from gamescom so we can be sure we have all of our facts straight. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/383159-de-escalation-see-posts-50-blue-and-150/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18301009330?page=3#55))<br />
<br />
World PvP and PvP Talents<br />
The intent is that PvP talents activate in world PvP, similar to how PvP item levels currently activate in Warlords. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/383162-active-world-pvp-realists-pvp-talents/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300628406?page=23#452))<br />
<br />
Flying in Legion<br />
Judging by this quote, it would seem we are basically not going to be getting flying until long after the final patch in Legion.<br />
<br />
Intentional or not, the wording from Blizzard on this issue is deceptive. They would be better off just out and saying &quot;We feel the expansion is experienced better with no flying, but we will add it a while after the final patch&quot;.<br />
The quote is in reference to how you are able to earn flying for Draenor via an Achievement. If you read some of the interviews out there (and we'll try to make sure we gather them up for people), it's mentioned that you should be able to start working on the Achievement as of the start of the expansion. Again, it's very early and we only just announced the expansion, so we'll have a lot more information to share on this and many other things announced during gamescom. <br />
<br />
Flying for Draenor is coming and anyone who is able to help test it on the PTR is very appreciated. We want to make sure we have people in the air versus falling through the world.<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting. Whether I agree with your sentiments or not, I understand you're trying to put a positive spin on a situation you did not create.<br />
I'm just trying to add some balance where I can. I understand passion and understand people expressing that passion on a variety of topics regarding the game. But, expressing that passion can be done without resorting to hyperbole and code of conduct violations on the forums.<br />
<br />
You are so about to be rushed by angry fly-babies. It was nice knowing you though.<br />
People have been twisting my words or using them as &quot;promises&quot; for many years now. I'm not going anywhere. I also don't like the trend of calling people or groups of people names just because they have something they feel strongly about. It's not worthy of anyone who wants to have their thoughts taken seriously.

Pre-Order for Legion<br />
When World of Warcraft Legion will be available for pre order ? Im so excited I want to pre order it right now lol.<br />
We'll let you know when pre-orders become available. Don't worry. <br />
<br />
I know people have a lot of questions about what will be included in the pre-order, but I don't have those answers to share just yet. We'll make sure we cover as much as possible when we announce them though. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/383135-pre-order-for-legion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18301008352?page=3#54))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Legion<br />
Artifact's stats will still improve as you defeat BOSSES, Relics: completing major quest lines, DUNGEONS, &amp; RAIDS...<br />
The more difficult the content you do, the higher your weapon's DPS will be. That's been true since 2004, no? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/630609754210103296))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Did you just nerf Felblight x5 drop rates a couple hours ago? Was getting them ALL the time the past 5 days, now i get none.<br />
This was hotfixed yesterday. It wasn't intended for 5x Felblight to drop so frequently from profession resources in Tanaan. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/628683488883929088))<br />
<br />
Events<br />
There are three tents still marked as Under Construction at the Darkmoon Faire. What mini-games would you put there? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/628057043488772096))<br />
Had some real ideas for an Darkmoon faire but its been a while. Ill get back to you with them when I remember<br />
Already have plans for two of them so you'd better hurry &gt;=] (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/628058374077157377))<br />
Hammer and bell is kinda boring though... if there were no constraints, what would you wanna implement? <br />
No constraints at all? Darkmoon DDR. Like Flash Flash Revolution but with techno carnival music. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/628094099707396096))<br />

<br />
Well, I'm with you that they never got shadow to work...but I think it's not on the list. Simply cause I believe they would not make a &quot;pure&quot; healing or &quot;pure&quot; tanking class. In case of priest I think they would kill holy cause it's anyway not very unique(or maybe disc because absorbtion caused them a lot of trouble when it comes to balancing). If you'd kill 1 warlock and 1 mage tree(don't need 3 anyway) then you would have more free unique abilities for shadow too.<br />
I think especially the pure dd-classes all got at least one tree that nobody would really miss....since most people only seem to switch to certain trees when they are OP and not cause they like those trees. Might be an interesting poll for Blizz...like asking all level 100 rogues which tree they wouldn't really miss(in a situation where all three trees do the same damage).<br />
<br />
<br />
I gonna enjoy to call rogues &quot;Sewer Rats&quot;. As a shadow that's how I see them anyway....=)</div></div><hr />

<br />
like a barbers shop with chairs on the other side or a bottom floor that only rogues can interact it. Sitting instantly gives us a loading screen into the class halls area (assuming they are instanced) with the chair behind us on a raisable platform. Implying it &quot;descended&quot; into the underground base.<br />
<br />
It will be a good spy series reference ontop of a cool rogue thing.<br />
<br />
Or have a regular looking shop that everyone uses to repair, buy items or profession stuff BUT ITS A FRONT, the room in the back looks unassuming but has a book case/something that only rogues can use to access their class hall area.</div></div><hr />

This is such bullshit. Everyone is getting Ashbringer, Doomhammer and whatever else artifacts they come up with, but the old, incredible looking ones are not OK? The CLOAK?! Absolutely horrendous. I really hope they change their mind on this. Not &quot;everyone&quot; will farm Warglaives, and it will not be a mandatory fucking thing to do.

It still involves pure luck, so it's not like cities will be crowded with them. Look at what people said when transmog came out; &quot;omg everyone will use x set and it will be completely shit!!&quot; - no. That's not what happened, and the same thing goes for the legendaries.<br />
<br />
Are you mixing up artifacts and legendaries just to whine? The artifacts system, the non-weapon legendaries with spell effects, and the old legendary weapons not being allowed for transmog, are entirely different matters altogether.<br />
<br />
Also there is a vast difference between transmog for gear (which is absolutely numerous and varied) and legendaries, which are few in number and particularly unique, which makes them very likely to be commonly used if allowed for transmog.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way, if they loosen the reigns to allow the ring and cloak effects, maybe in the future they will be convinced to loosen them further and allow legendaries too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That could be cool.. otherwise it's largely pointless.. hide cloak on half my toons, ring is invisible. <br />
<br />
Not to mention I couldn't be bothered to get them on more than two toons before Blizz removed them from the game for no real reason (Well I assume this was a Blizz's patented 'indirect announcement via a third party website' that the WoD ring will be removed too).<br />
<br />
Considering they apparently find adding new content in a timely manner super difficult, you'd think they want to encourage people to go back and farm up old legendaries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so it is confirmed...another raid or die expansion..and people thought that they can progress their artifact weapons doing their favorite activities...not it will be just like any previous expansion..you will level your character, get some dungeon gear, all these in the first month and then you have to raid for good gear and relics. Dungeons will probably just give a nice bunch of artifact points the first time you do in the game, which sometime will be useless, as garrison resources that are rewarded now..<br />

No, not really. One of their biggest arguments has always been that they don't want everyone to run around with the legendaries and the unique look they offer. Now that changes, so the argument is pointless. It might not be the same system, but that's irrelevant, because we're talking about Transmogrification and the visual look of your weapons. <br />
<br />
It's great that they might allow Cloak to be transmogrified, but it is completely useless for so many people because we hide our cloaks look. I really wish Blizzard would allow us to make our own choice here. Let us transmog whatever we want, and those who want to farm all legendaries will have to work hard to get them / be lucky as fuck. The argument that it would feel too much like a chore or mandatory doesn't hold up.</div></div><hr />

No real motivation? You could say the same for Pandaria.

<br />
cloak and ring is mentioned, so iam assuming they mean the spell effects themselves. the non weapon legendaries can be excluded from the argument because they aren't in your face like the weapon models (outside of the temp spell aura/effects) and took an entire expansion to create and earn, . Plus they mentioned we didn't get to have them for too long (for something we spent do much time to obtain). <br />
<br />
Anyway, this is an option they are only considering that might or might not be included.<br />
<br />
With the other legendaries, the farming/luck is irrelevant. When available, people will keep working to get them and over time more and more of people will have them in hand. Though I agree that not everyone will get them because not everyone wants to mog them as much as people/blizz thinks.<br />
<br />
In truth I am all for removing the mog restrictions, I can see the reasons behind blizz's decision to not do so but I think that enough time is starting to pass that the reasons are eroding in value. Wont be the most ideal time to do this with artifacts coming, but the next expansion, IF they do the ring/cloak allowance for Legion? Then yes, they should totally remove them.<br />

<br />
&quot;less faction tension these days and more races pissed off with each other due to history&quot;. Did you think that through when you read it? That's one of the most common reasons for factional tension, the 2nd being resources (which guess what is also present and being fought for).<br />
<br />
The Alliance and Horde are still at each others throats and not cooperating at all. it is the class factions that are banding together now to ignore factional conflicts and do what is necessary while their governments screw around with each other<br />
<br />
Lost isles wasn't a good strategic foothold because no one knew it had any value and few knew where it was, it had no reason to attract any factions attention till now. <br />
<br />
With a MASSIVE demonic invasion being prepared there, its going to attract attention. Not difficult to figure out. its like the maelstrom, no one had any reason to bother with it till the cataclysm, why interfere with that elune-forsaken area? There are probably loads of minor land masses out in the ocean that have no reason to attract peoples attention unless something significant happens.<br />
<br />
Just a bare few major people would be aware of its location (it is not common knowledge) and even fewer would know of the Tomb of Sargaras, which was best left alone and uninterfered with, unless you wanted to send entire armies to be swallowed up without any discernible reason to do so. <br />
<br />
Maiev, Illidan and the Naga certainly aren't going to be very chatty, the wardens will have info on it but will judge it a beehive to be avoided and completely outside of their purpose, people like Khadgar and Malfurion most likely know of it but will be too wise to go messing about with it. There is enough shit constantly going on (outland portals, multiple undead invasions, old god infestations, iron Horde, the cataclysm, a major factional war spilling into a newly discovered land, without going to places to stir shit up even more up.<br />
<br />
Silithas was left alone because it had no reason to gain our attention until . People wont getting an itch to head to northrend for the same reason until Arthas purposely instigated events. Hyjal and the highlands were doing just fine until the cataclysm. We're going to the lost isles now because the legion is trying to end the world. that's a PRETTY big reason to start giving it attention.<br />
<br />
it is not hard to understand the concept of not going to places when you have no reason to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not even a Rogue and I couldn't care less but just look at the blue posts regarding the Rogue's order hall in Legion.<br />
<br />
The rogues were asking about a different order hall, one not inside Dalaran. The response they get:<br />
<br />
''It's a strong Rogue theme to be 'hiding right behind you'. Not so much for Paladins.'' - Then why are the rogues asking for it, why are the rogues hidden in Westfall, Ravenholdt and dozens of other places? And then why is there the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind, filled with Paladins? It would be more like the other way around if it wasn't for the invasions they had to deal with.<br />
<br />
Same thing counts for the Flying issue in Legion. The players think that the wording on the achievement means that they won't be able to get flying until the final patch in Legion, so they are asking about it. The Blue's reaction?: ''If you read some of the interviews out there (and we'll try to make sure we gather them up for people), it's mentioned that you should be able to start working on the Achievement as of the start of the expansion.'' - The blue basically just parroted what the players were asking about it and didn't give any answer to it. Get to the point please.<br />
<br />
I don't give a rats ass about Rogues Order Halls or whether there will be Flying or not, but please Blizzard, stop talking around questions and get to the point. Answer with yes or no or say that you agree or disagree with the player. Talking about ''scripted'' answers. <br />

<br />
Why not? The whole point is to bribe them so they go away long enough (i.e. &quot;for a while&quot;) in order for people to have some no-holds-barred PVP in the Underbelly. Makes perfect sense. Not sure what there is to not see, nor how you'd think that wouldn't work for an MMO?<br />
<br />
ETA:<br />
If they make the legendary cloak transmogable, I think they should make replicas available. <br />
Hear me out.<br />
I was working on the cloak questline at the time of its removal and unfortunately missed it due to having to take a week off from it for a family event.<br />
<br />
Was always salty that I missed it, so if they made it transmogable, they should make all of them transmogable, and make replicas available. Else they should just leave them non-moggable.<br />
<br />
I don't think they should be moggable period. If they're going to do that, might as well put the old non-obtainable titles back in, the non-obtainable mounts, etc.. They've always seemed pretty good about giving a nod (however small it might be) to people who have been playing a long time/who put the work in to get these legendaries. It seems cheap to just hand them out with no effort; it cheapens the work and time spent by people who were there when it was current. Not many people bother clicking for achievements to see FOSs, they look for titles and gear and such. <br />
<br />
While it would be cool to mog the Firelands staff on my casters, I'd rather just equip the thing anyway. Being able to mog it without getting the effect that goes with it just seems to make the whole point moot. Like they said, all it will do (if they activate it for other legendaries) is make ten million people all have the Warglaives or Thunderfury mog. <br />
<br />
When everything is legendary, nothing is legendary.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't seem as though they have gotten much past the story board step, which is a bit concerning when people are throwing around a 1st quarter 2016 release. I just cannot see them being able to deliver this, based on my current impressions of where they are in development, within 6 months. &quot;beta later this year&quot;, so December 31st 2015. That gives them 3.5 months, followed by 3 months of beta ... that seems like an awfully agressive timeline for an expansion that doesn't seem fully fleshed out yet.<br />
<br />
BTW, they need to ease up on the expansion only gimmicks: the farm, the garrisons, these are all throw away things. I'd imagine that some people might put some more effort into them if they were going to be useful later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For about a week. <br />
<br />
Honestly, this argument was used a whole lot about armor when transmogrification came out. &quot;Oh, every Paladin will run around with the Judgement set, every Warlock will wear the Malefic Raiment, every Priest will wear the Absolution Regalia&quot;... And as it turns out, most people don't actually wear those. <br />
<br />
If they'd add legendary items to transmogrification, everyone that has one would most likely wave it around proudly for a bit, and they'd go back to weapons that are much cooler to them and fit their set better. Or they'd go back to not caring about transmogrification at all like a lot of players do. <br />
<br />
My Paladin has a Thunderfury, a Sulfuras and a Val'Anyr. I'd have no interest in using any of them. I can already use an HD version of Sulfuras that I got from Firelands, so why bother with the legendary one? Thunderfury's effect is too distracting for me, and I don't really care for Val'Anyr's appearance. My Rogue wouldn't use his Fangs of the Father, it just doesn't fit the look I'm going for. I've never even had enough interest in the Glaives to farm them. I have Thori'dal on my Hunter but I wouldn't use it either, it's overly embellished and there are way cooler bows out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, the ring is going away, when 7.0 drops. Get it now! Don't be like me with the cloak, and think you can farm it later! <br />
<br />
The PvP changes are interesting, but c'mon. PvP should have rewards that aren't numbers on a menu item, the striking look of PvP gear was as much a reward as your rating. I just feel more and more the devs don't have a single clue what motivates players, or the budget is so lean, they can't invest in designing PvP gear anymore. Or both. PvP, by all rights, should be it's own ecosystem - it's own talents, it's own glyphs, it's own rewards. Now it's just Prestige points. Yay. So exciting. Now, if they add transmog gear for PvP looks based on the new currency system, that's fine...but how would that be any different than just designing PvP gear? You work to get a specific number of points or whatever, you get to change the look of your shoulders, wether it's by currency for PvP gear, or currency for a transmog. Oh, yeah - the new system, they don't have to design gear. <br />
<br />
As for rogues...I don't think they like them, I think the devs who did, and designed them, and cared left Blizzard long ago. Oh, we get stealth and CC. Wait, what's CC again? Oh yeah - those talents nobody uses anymore, because they're far too busy to sap anything in a dungeon or raid, time is gear, fella. Ravenholdt? You'll take the sewers and like them. <br />
<br />
&quot;Subtlety Rogues will keep doing down the ninja route, Combat will be a little more like a Pirate Swashbuckler&quot;<br />

South Sea expansion, confirmed.<br />

Nice to see the candle can talk in circles as good as the skull and the tree. They're getting rather salty over there. They haven't learned a fucking thing - the run up to this one, and the fallout when it releases is going to be the best free entertainment going. They talked a good game, but it's still the same old Blizzard, who knows better than anyone else, and doesn't respect their customers. <br />
<br />
Seriously, you're a community manager, and you're picking fights with paying customers. JUST. STOP. POSTING. You do more damage when you post, than when don't.</div></div><hr />

The Blizzard devs could design a game thats literally picking up cinder blocks from one side of the room, and carrying them to the other side, and would describe it as &quot;cool&quot;, because they slapped an achievement on it.<br />
<br />
Player: Nothing else to do, might as well go scrape Tanaan for some stuff. <br />
Devs: See? They like it! Design more like that! <br />

Does not bode well for Legion. They do NOT understand player motivation, or refuse to understand it.</div></div><hr />

We'll let you know when pre-orders become available. Don't worry. <br />

I know people have a lot of questions about what will be included in the pre-order, but I don't have those answers to share just yet. We'll make sure we cover as much as possible when we announce them though. (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)<br />

<br />
I bag on the CMs, but honestly, how could it be anything else? One hand does not talk to the other down there in Irvine. The CM defends their decision, and then Celestalon - who doesn't even design this kind of content, pops up with &quot;Maybe it's not either!&quot; <br />

It's not THAT big of an issue, but it's little snippets like this that show how dysfunctional and incompetent they are as a team. This is amateur hour stuff, not a seasoned, professional team of over a decade. <br />

<br />
Agreed. I think they sometimes mistake &quot;engagement&quot; (i.e. player activity) with fun... i.e. folks will do things because it is more rewarding, &quot;required&quot; for something they want (such as flying, legendary quest line, achievements, etc.), or because they don't have anything they want to do more after raiding is done.<br />
<br />
So, player activity doesn't necessarily equate to &quot;awesome&quot; any more than marketing necessarily equates to reality :)<br />
<br />
But yes, ever since mid May developer interviews, I've been pretty convinced they just don't get what a fair number of folks think is wrong with the game. Personally, I didn't like the dungeons being irrelevant to gear progression, that garrisons were a mindless grind that was also immensely rewarding for little effort or engagement, gathering was made irrelevant outside of garrisons, and that flying was prohibited in WoD which really pissed me off since I actually love quite a few of my flying mounts as well as my damn flight form!!!!.<br />
<br />
Some of it is PR spin, but more than I'd like is probably real game design decisions that just aren't for me (I quit at the end of June for Final Fantasy XIV after 10+ years of WoW). :mad:</div></div><hr />

One of their biggest arguments has always been that they don't want everyone to run around with the legendaries and the unique look they offer. Now that changes, so the argument is pointless. It might not be the same system, but that's irrelevant, because we're talking about Transmogrification and the visual look of your weapons.<br />
<br />
Except theres multiple different models and skins for each artefact, and then colour variations within that, so everyone won't look the same. With legendaries, every Thunderfury looks like every other Thunderfury.</div></div><hr />

The team wants to continue to evolve the endgame world content model though, as they aren't happy with the combination of daily quests and bonus objectives. They are two pieces of the puzzle, but larger ongoing story development is also important, similar to what was in Patch 5.1. Other mechanics to add more replayability and variation would also be good additions and there are plans for Legion to make better endgame world content.<br />
<br />
Don't act like that sack of shit zone is anything but forced. Is this for fucking real? &quot;There are a lot of players doing it every day&quot; No shit sherlock, you fucking gated flying and infinite stat runes behind it. Of course everyone's going to do it, we have to.</div></div><hr />

Sure its got rogue stuff, but is it a location that is ICONIC to rogues? Because thats what class halls were being billed as.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We also have Rogue halls in the capital cities, the rogue trainers in Stormwind have their own little complex there, which would make more sense than the sewers. They're sending the other classes back into old content for their class halls, why not rogues?<br />
<br />
Answer: they already designed it, and their ego is kicking in. You can almost feel it, by the way the CMs are rationalizing it. Ego seems to be a big problem for them, as hinted by Ion, and more vaguely, by Ghostcrawler. <br />
<br />
And, in the long run, who cares, from a dev point of view? They get paid, either way. Is this prima donna bullshit worth it in the long run? Is the location of the rogue class hall that important to their fragile egos that they'll risk angering and annoying rogue players? Just change it, for fuck's sake. It's just a fucking game, in 2 years, when the next expansion is rolling, nobody will give a flying fuck about class halls. <br />
<br />
Stockton and Brack need to start putting feet up asses over silly shit like this. Rogues want Ravenholdt? Give it to them. What does it matter at the end of the day? You don't have major awards and bonus checks riding on it. It's not a class balance issue, or a benefit to the class. Just. Fucking. Do. It.</div></div><hr />

You don't design the same, and you're not the only person playing it. There is a lot wrong with WoW right now, but I would never consider fucking Tanaan Jungle to be one of those things. It's a daily questing zone. They've had them in many different forms many different times. This is not new. The sky is not falling. No one is forcing you to quest there.<br />
<br />
I have actually enjoyed the zone quite a bit, and find it much preferable to daily-hubs we've gotten in past xpacs. Sorry if you don't enjoy it, but it's not a single player game. You're just one person.<br />

Too bad that's not why I go to Tanaan, or why I'm doing the quests. Your motivations are not my motivations are not anyone else's motivations. Some people enjoy questing. Some people enjoy just killing mobs. Some people enjoy world PvP. Some people just want to get Pathfinder and get out. Some people are in it for gear. Some people are in it for different reasons. I have never feel forced into going to Tanaan; no one is. <br />

Seriously. I don't see the issue. Sure Ravenpoop would be nice, but I always thought the underbelly was hella roguey anyway. It was a dank, dark, shady ass place with black markets, fighting arenas, and seedy ass little taverns build into a sewer. I'm not sure what the hell class rogues think they're playing, but that sounds perfectly on-point to me....<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed. I think they sometimes mistake &quot;engagement&quot; (i.e. player activity) with fun... i.e. folks will do things because it is more rewarding, &quot;required&quot; for something they want (such as flying, legendary quest line, achievements, etc.), or because they don't have anything they want to do more after raiding is done. So, player activity doesn't necessarily equate to &quot;awesome&quot; any more than marketing necessarily equates to reality :)<br />
<br />
You're still making the same mistake many others in this thread are making; assuming that your feelings are universal. YOU might be mistaking players actually enjoying this content for them just &quot;engaging&quot; with it because they feel forced to. There are any number of things I can decide to do when logging onto WoW. Whether or not I go knock out some dailies in Tanaan or solo my way through an old raid or something is entirely up to what I think will be the most fun. It has nothing to do with achievements or requirements. This is a game, not a damn career.<br />
<br />
<br />
But yes, ever since mid May developer interviews, I've been pretty convinced they just don't get what a fair number of folks think is wrong with the game. Personally, I didn't like the dungeons being irrelevant to gear progression, that garrisons were a mindless grind that was also immensely rewarding for little effort or engagement, gathering was made irrelevant outside of garrisons, and that flying was prohibited in WoD which really pissed me off since I actually love quite a few of my flying mounts as well as my damn flight form!!!!.<br />
<br />
Now these are all perfectly fair criticisms in my opinion. While there are certainly people who are unhappy with the content we have gotten, I think the much larger group of people is upset about the LACK of content. This xpac has been very limited in terms of having things to do outside of raiding at endgame, and I think people are being HYPER critical of what we have gotten because we've gotten so little. Tanaan is worlds better than Timeless Islands for example, but TI came out among tons of other content, and Tanaan is basically one lonely hub after months of playing the same two raids over and over. <br />
<br />
Think about it.... if you're giving out free food, the person who hasn't eaten in two months might be a lot more hungry, but they'll also be more critical of the food they get than the person who doesn't really care about it because they just had lunch. If their food sucks, they can shrug it off. No big thang. If the guy who hasn't eaten in two months thinks the food is crap, he's likely to get a lot more pissed off about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't act like that sack of shit zone is anything but forced. Is this for fucking real? &quot;There are a lot of players doing it every day&quot; No shit sherlock, you fucking gated flying and infinite stat runes behind it. Of course everyone's going to do it, we have to.<br />
<br />
Don't act like your feeling &quot;forced&quot; is somehow applicable to other people. I'm sorry if YOU have allowed yourself to feel &quot;forced&quot; to do things by a damn video game, but that only means that you desperately need some damn perspective in your life. Go outside. Find a hobby. Read a book.<br />
<br />
I've been doing Tanaan every day, and I've had my Pathfinder achieve for almost three and a half weeks now. What the fuck am I being &quot;forced&quot; to do again? I enjoy questing. I enjoy world PVP. I enjoy seeing other players while doing stuff. No one &quot;has to&quot; do anything. This xpac is almost over, and considering the fact that there aren't going to be any more content patches, you don't &quot;need&quot; flying in draenor to begin with. The only thing it'll be is a nice quality of life improvement, and a nice bump for leveling alts. <br />

YOU might be mistaking players actually enjoying this content for them just &quot;engaging&quot; with it because they feel forced to. There are any number of things I can decide to do when logging onto WoW. Whether or not I go knock out some dailies in Tanaan or solo my way through an old raid or something is entirely up to what I think will be the most fun. It has nothing to do with achievements or requirements. This is a game, not a damn career.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now these are all perfectly fair criticisms in my opinion. While there are certainly people who are unhappy with the content we have gotten, I think the much larger group of people is upset about the LACK of content. This xpac has been very limited in terms of having things to do outside of raiding at endgame, and I think people are being HYPER critical of what we have gotten because we've gotten so little. Tanaan is worlds better than Timeless Islands for example, but TI came out among tons of other content, and Tanaan is basically one lonely hub after months of playing the same two raids over and over. <br />
<br />
Think about it.... if you're giving out free food, the person who hasn't eaten in two months might be a lot more hungry, but they'll also be more critical of the food they get than the person who doesn't really care about it because they just had lunch.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't act like your feeling &quot;forced&quot; is somehow applicable to other people. I'm sorry if YOU have allowed yourself to feel &quot;forced&quot; to do things by a damn video game, but that only means that you desperately need some damn perspective in your life. Go outside. Find a hobby. Read a book.<br />
<br />
I've been doing Tanaan every day, and I've had my Pathfinder achieve for almost three and a half weeks now. What the fuck am I being &quot;forced&quot; to do again? I enjoy questing. I enjoy world PVP. I enjoy seeing other players while doing stuff. No one &quot;has to&quot; do anything. This xpac is almost over, and considering the fact that there aren't going to be any more content patches, you don't &quot;need&quot; flying in draenor to begin with. The only thing it'll be is a nice quality of life improvement, and a nice bump for leveling alts. <br />
<br />
Big fucking whoop.<br />
<br />
Feel better now?<br />
<br />
LOL. <br />
<br />
Edit, sorry, didn't see you were flaming and raging at more than one person. Well, at least you're efficient.<br />

If you voiced your opinion without swearing and insulting others, you realize people might take you more seriously? You just look like a child who had their favorite toy taken away or Mommy won't buy you a new toy at the store. Just because you're angry doesn't mean swearing (or violence) is the answer. Just walk away, calm down, and do something else while others who can voice their opinions without swearing or name calling discuss things. I've had my share of moments where Blizzard pissed me off. I chose to do something else that I do enjoy when that happens and come back to WoW later.<br />
<br />
In regards to the rogue hall, Blizzard can easily tweak Ravenholdt to be a class hall and then reuse the sewer hall for other things like vendors or even a new proving grounds area (if that makes a comeback again). We don't know how large these areas will be so the sewer one could be a solo scenario of sorts with traps throughout that players have to bypass to get to something (like the treasure scenario on Isle of Thunder). Or it can be a new proving grounds area where players have to use walls to LOS mobs, chase after mobs who teleport, avoid beams, etc. Beats open room MoP proving grounds which ultimately teach nothing but how to stand in one spot and tunnel vision your target. They could also do a new Brawler's Guild in there that's open faction that has new fights specific to Legion while also updating the current one while keeping the bosses largely the same. Blizzard doesn't have to scrap it if they give Ravenholdt to rogues. Sad part is, if rogues get Ravenholdt, chances are they will scrap the sewer hall rather than repurpose it.<br />
<br />
If they're afraid of screwing up Ravenholdt quests like the Fangs of the Father with Ravenholdt, then they can just add in a lower basement to Ravenholdt that's the class hall and leave the rest of the building unchanged. The lower basement could have been uncovered during the Fangs of the Father quest (unbeknownst to the player) leading to the remaining Ravenholdt rogues repurposing it for a class hall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't seem as though they have gotten much past the story board step, which is a bit concerning when people are throwing around a 1st quarter 2016 release. I just cannot see them being able to deliver this, based on my current impressions of where they are in development, within 6 months. &quot;beta later this year&quot;, so December 31st 2015. That gives them 3.5 months, followed by 3 months of beta ... that seems like an awfully agressive timeline for an expansion that doesn't seem fully fleshed out yet.<br />
<br />
BTW, they need to ease up on the expansion only gimmicks: the farm, the garrisons, these are all throw away things. I'd imagine that some people might put some more effort into them if they were going to be useful later.<br />
<br />
No. they have developed and know their direction. They just arent sharing it because its liable to change or be altered and if people know they go up in arms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As someone arriving to this thread late and having read the comments, you have some valid points but it does kinda get lost in the &quot;Mad-ness, Bro.&quot;<br />
<br />
You lost me by bringing up entitlement, though. What are you, an aging baby boomer shaking your fist at those &quot;lousy millenials?&quot;<br />
I wish entitlement were stricken from the dictionary. It's become such a powerless, lazy, catch-all word.<br />
<br />
I was around for late vanilla and through every patch after. I'll tell you--Tanaan is nowhere near as fun or exciting as Quel'danas was. Not even going to touch Skettis, Netherwing faction, etc. I think one of the biggest things those areas had going for them was a feeling of importance tied to story. Tanaan just feels like, &quot;Go here, kill x of y, okay great work go kill some more somethings.&quot; In Quel'danas we had servers working to unlock new rewards as a community. I remember yelling at people over trade to go do their dailies so my backwater server could get the badge vendor up.<br />
<br />
Was it perfect? No. But there's got to be a balance between storyless timesinks (Timeless Isle, Tanaan) and MOP--which, btw, didn't really have bad dailies. The issue with MoP which has been pounded into the core of Azeroth at this point is that they were too gated. You had dailies gated behind reputation gated behind dailies, and then beyond all that, you needed to earn resources to buy the rewards. It was absurd, and bad design.<br />
<br />

<br />
They intend to let the sewers be an optional (paid, gold) pvp free-for-all. While I like that idea, I want to make sure it doesn't turn into a hassle for rogues trying to get to their class hall. I like your Brawler's Guild idea.<br />
<br />
I'm not particularly partial to either area as a rogue spot, but I will say having class hall right next to the capitol is quite convenient.<br />
<br />
That said, I like seeing defunct places made purposeful again.</div></div><hr />

That is not fun that is stupid.. I like the way the Rare Spawns worked in MoP (not Timeless Isle) they don't always drop the item you want you had to actually farm them, then spawn rate was an hour and not every gets credit for the kill..

Well, I really can't help it if people ascribe a tone to my words that isn't there. I'm not shy about my opinions, and I don't pussyfoot around in stating them. That doesn't mean I'm &quot;mad.&quot; I'm sitting here at work posting on a video game forum... &quot;mad&quot; is so far outside of the lines that it's funny. Why would I get &quot;mad&quot; about other people misrepresenting their opinions? O-o People bicker on these forums all day every day, but the second I say someone people don't like I'm &quot;raging?&quot; Just seems like a cop-out to me. Any time people disagree or dislike something, oh that person must be a troll, or butthurt, or nerdraging. Obvious can't be that they have a point. Nahhh. I've come to terms with the fact that I apparently can't open my mouth or type a word without people assuming I'm being hostile or argumentative, so whatever. Might as well just own it and move on.<br />
<br />
Not sure where you're getting this whole &quot;baby boomers&quot; vs &quot;Millennials&quot; thing. This isn't an age or generational thing, it's a personality and upbringing thing. I have no idea what the ages of the people complaining are, and I don't really care. They could be 10 or 50, it's their behavior I find annoying. Sorry if other people overusing the term &quot;entitlement&quot; has left you with a bitter taste, but I do not use that term frequently; I use it here because it is applicable. People in this fandom often feel entitled to having the game designed the way THEY want it, and they go further to imply that the way THEY want it MUST be the way everyone else wants it. That's...pretty much dictionary Entitlement right there. They do it with their classes. They do it with general game design. It's just plain childish. I have absolutely no complaints about people voicing their opinions until they try to hold them up as facts or common beliefs. It cheapens their own position in the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Not even going to touch Skettis, Netherwing faction, etc. I think one of the biggest things those areas had going for them was a feeling of importance tied to story.

You had dailies gated behind reputation gated behind dailies, and then beyond all that, you needed to earn resources to buy the rewards. It was absurd, and bad design.<br />
<br />
I believe I've specifically provided Quel'Danas as an example of how this type of questing can be handled better. I specifically said, actually, that the type of forward progress during Q'D and Firelands dailies was something I wish they had done in Tanaan. That type of feeling that us doing dailies every day is actually moving the story ahead was really my single major complaint for Tanaan.<br />
<br />
That said, I didn't find Skettis of Netherwing any more &quot;fun&quot; or &quot;exciting&quot; than I have found Tanaan. They were all grinds, and they were all vicariously attached to the plot of the game. It's not like Skettis or NEtherwing really had any impact on the plot, and ignoring them completely didn't mean you miss out on anything. Tanaan is actually a lot more built into the plot of WoD than they were. I also still don't see what the difference is in terms of the actual quests. Telling me to go to the mines and kill a bunch of demons isn't any different from telling me to go to a maintain and kill a bunch of demons. Telling me to run around collecting crystals isn't much different from telling me to run around collecting treasures or missives. All the old dalies, even on Quel'Danas, were the same shit. They were killing things, or collecting things. Every once in a while you get a quest like the dragon race, or killing an elite, but for the most part it's all the same shit we're doing in Tanaan. It just didn't have a bar. That is the difference. A bar. It's like people would suddenly stop being angry about Tanaan questing if they stopped putting bars there to fill and just told them to kill 100 mobs instead. There is practically and functionally zero difference between the two approaches. Sure, Quel'Danas did a MUCH better job at making it obvious what we were questing for, but the WAY we were doing it wasn't really any different. Instead of a bar to fill, we had a statue to put up. K? and?<br />
<br />
Back when Nether and Skittis came out, that kind of daily hub was a new thing. It was exciting. Even more so for Quel'Danas as that type of ever-changing daily situation had never been done before. Over the years, the idea has gotten played with and reused, and I think people are just bored of it. That's not the quests fault.....</div></div><hr />

Healers 100% necessary all the time. Skill will matter LESS. No one wants to play against the same geared player all the time. Top arena ladder, sure. Skill matters there. Wheres the rewards for playing more? Non existant. Everyone will be maxed out on their perks and gear will be the same. Sounds like a plan to kill your own game. Melee hunter, thats a cool idea.

As for the legendary transmogs... I can sort of understand Blizzard's point of not wanting people to farm something like the Warglaives for transmog, but people farm for them regularly regardless do they not? I do. I don't really see how it'd be different whether they were farmed for collection purposes or transmog purposes. That's just my two cents.</div></div><hr />

Eh, I don't think it's that bad. I would at least go experience it. I just think it's dumb that these huge tents have been closed off for 4 years now. What is available, though, is somewhat decent. There are a handful of pets/mounts/toys to collect there, and I'm into collecting stuff, and there's also achievements, so I did all that. Used to do the dailies on all of my characters so I could buy everything. I've owned it all for awhile now, though, so I only bother doing the stuff on my main these days. It's a cheap and easy way to buy all the heirlooms and upgrade them. (Only to 90, though. And I already had most of the heirlooms grandfathered to 90 when the patch hit.) I don't even need most of the heirlooms anymore since I have mostly everything I want leveled, but I still like to collect.</div></div><hr />

In the past whats fun about pvping? Destroying those people who didnt have gear, which also drove those people with no gear to play more and get gear. Now everyone is going to hit like a sissy baby. Healers 100% necessary all the time. Skill will matter LESS. No one wants to play against the same geared player all the time. Top arena ladder, sure. Skill matters there. Wheres the rewards for playing more? Non existant. Everyone will be maxed out on their perks and gear will be the same. Sounds like a plan to kill your own game. Melee hunter, thats a cool idea. I like new stuff in the game. i dont however like making the game into a different game. Pvp has always been about gear. If you get no advantage over the noob in bgs and he gets lucky facerolling on his keyboard then whats the point?<br />
<br />
You're the noob if you are killing players with the disadvantage of lower gear. everyone being the same strength makes skill matter SO MUCH MORE, you honestly have to have poor logic to think otherwise.</div></div><hr />

Rofl, says it's fun to roflstomp people with no gear, goes on to say that everyone being on the same playing field gear wise will mean skill is less relevant.<br />

If they allow legendary weapon transmog:<br />
<br />
All 1h melee weapons tmogged to either glaives or thunderfury.<br />
All 2h weapons mogged to sulfuras or shadowmourne.<br />
All staffs mogged to Dragonwrath.<br />
<br />
Blizzard knows what unlocking legendary transmog would do. You'd never see another weapon skin again. There'd be rogues, monks, warriors and DKs all running around with glaives because they're huge and flashy.</div></div><hr />

Yea man that'd be insane, it'd be like if they gave every Paladin Ashbringer... and then made a class specific hub where you'd just be surrounded by identical paladins all wearing t2 and Ashbringer...<br />
<br />
Oh wait.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This statement right here tells me right here that Blizzard have too many specs to balance, Assassins need time to do damage which means the ONLY USE in WOW will be raid bosses and in raids.. Same as Afflicition might as well get rid of them altogether if they have an extremely niche role and nerf the other specs because of it.<br />
<br />
They could eliminate one spec altogether and create Rogue as 2 specs one with permanent stealth and one that's without and both do something different.</div></div><hr />

Give me a break, druid have been a better stealth class for the last 5 years. They are the masters of stealth not rogue, get over it, blame your own design. What a laugh to read such a thing. At the same time they said &quot;about&quot;, they never said they were the best stealth class. So they are taking us for morons in the face for once, not stealthed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stealth isn't even the real issue, as stealth only comes into play opening a fight, and in PvP. The real issue is the weight of CC, when the overwhelming majority of players ignore CC as much as possible, because &quot;GOGOGOGOGOGO!&quot;, and actually run around sneering at crowd control and claiming anyone who uses it is &quot;bad&quot;. <br />
<br />
In Blizzard's mind, rogues have two defining features - and one of them is irrelevant. That's not good. <br />
<br />
And, once again, rogues have no raid utility, which means they'll be passed over for Demon Hunters. <br />
<br />
Unless there's a substantial revamp of rogues going into Legion, I can't see it playing out any way else. They've stripped rogues down to their bare bones, we don't even have an effective AOE anymore. I can't see them being given raid slots in Legion. Solo play? They may be okay. PvP? If they stay where they are, every rogue is going to roll a Demon Hunter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Stealth is silly element, what makes rogues are able to self buff their own weapons + back damage.<br />
Stealth is shared across a few classes, like Druid and so forth so it isn't independent<br />
<br />
They won't do this but they should reduce the specs of rogue by 2 since Assassination is extremely pointless, they need DOT to able to get the full effect. So it's only situational on niche which is extremely pointless for a class.<br />
<br />
What they should have is Combat, Pirate Swashbuckler without stealth able to tank up to heroic dungeons and dual wield and have a gun for range and finishing moves. They should have Camouflage or something that means they don't show up on the map able to use tricks and poisons to disable the opponent.<br />
<br />
Think more like Adelt from Rokka no Yuusha.<br />
<br />
With Subltey be a full on Ninja with full on stealth only showing up when they attack the opponent and so forth using knives which don't do much damage but able to slow the opponent and use maybe some magic relating to shadow.<br />
<br />
And remove Assassination cause Ninjas and Assassins are essentially the same thing being radical like have one with stealth and one without stealth adds an interesting concept on a class.<br />
<br />
Warlocks also suffer from the same causes as Rogues, have too many specs for a class that only really needs 2. Demonology (may have a range and a melee demon out the same time (Which they do with implosion type gate effect) and Destruction. They don't need to have Affliciton as that suffers the same problems as Assassination.<br />
<br />
The classes in WOW Are not like Riots Champions, Heroes of the Storms or even DOTA Heroes. They have many abilities your controling an alternate personality in those games where as in WOW you want a defining role. Blizzard are almost there but they really really need to cut back on class specs less the better when they can concertrate on more roles that suit them and focus on their special abilites and what they bring into the game instead of trying to control the player with limited abilities cause ITS broken in PVP and PVE type shit.<br />
<br />
Like Paladins with Seals, Auras and Blessings.<br />
Shamans with Totems<br />
Druids with Forms<br />
Mage with Spells<br />
Locks with Demons<br />
Hunters with Beast, melee range<br />
Warriors with Weapons<br />
Monks with Hand to hand combat<br />
etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was a point until they announced the artifact weapons. Now every class-specialisation will run around wielding Ashbringer, Doom Hammer. If that's okay or wanted, why not make all legendaries transmogable?</div></div><hr />
