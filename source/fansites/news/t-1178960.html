<br />
Favorite things about this cinematic:<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually shows Humans and Orcs fighting. When was the last time we saw an Orc in our WoW cinematics, I ask you? A LONG F&amp;$*%ING TIME.<br />
Touches of comedy remind me of the sheeping Mage, the Warlock hellfiring Murlocs... just yes.<br />
Everything is beautiful -- the realism of everything in the graphics, with a great non-Uncanny Valley triggering of anything from the human (which I was a bit afraid of happening, but no need to worry after all. :D) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If this cinematic is capturing the spirit of this expansion, then I'm excited for it!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apom</div><div class="date">2012-08-16, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A bit different from the previous trailers..no great evil..maybe they could have included some Sha like in the first quests..<br />
Or maybe if the human was turalyon and not beaten to the ground..<br />
And lol at that blunt look a 2:30<br />
Also interesting animation of the orc and human..sometimes their muscles move like bubble gum, feels strange<br />
Overall I miss the seriousness and epicness..looks like the cinematic of licks and spits<br />
Cant beat Wow+Tbc+Wotlk ones. Cata maybe<br />
The smiling monk in the end is all I really liked :confused:</div></div><hr />

Let's hope they do the same with the other races and all will be well; make them look good, that is.</div></div><hr />

The first 2 minutes all I could do was think of the good things that we could be seeing instead of this boredom.<br />
The fight was cool. Should have interspersed it with other cool Pandaria stuff going on.<br />
<br />
It takes a lot to disappoint me, but somehow Blizzard managed to do it.</div></div><hr />

Nope, right there with ya.<br />
<br />
As always the art direction is stunning, but compared to the power and sheer scale of the previous cinematics, it was terrible. Where's the WAR in Warcraft, not the &quot;human and orc getting their asses kicked by one lone Pandaren&quot;?<br />
<br />
Disappointing.</div></div><hr />

I can understand that they dont have any important lore enemies to focus on but at least gief mass scale battle between horde/alliance and monks then making their appearance on large numbers also. <br />

It didn't have that WOW! feeling...<br />
<br />
Im really disappointed with the orc...its fighting style was so 'human'. I wanted the orc to be more bestial and distinctive...like the orc in the vanilla trailer - u know the one beating his mace on the ground.<br />
Plus the orc in the trailer; i would've preferred if his color was more of a natural green color like darker olive green rathar then emerald green. <br />
<br />
the graphics is awesome and it did feel like it was returning to a more vanilla style of game play: horde vs alliance. <br />
Although this did imply that the Pandaren were far superior.</div></div><hr />

Didn't have that sinister looming threat like the past cinematics. Ones that make you want to rise up and take down the big baddy. There wasn't even a hint of war in this besides the 2 seconds of naval battles. To much time was spent showing an orc and a human lost in a forest. There was some humor, but people want blizzard to reinforce the idea that this expansion will be serious, yet this just went against that. This didn't leave me excited for the expansion. It was a complete snooze. Great animation, but the &quot;story&quot; was lacking big time. They could have showed the turtle island, a vista of the pandaren cities, the sha. Something else. But this....meh. I was really hoping to be blown away. Just no.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, that's what I like about it. There's no epic boss showing off their powers, talking about how powerful they are, ending with a roar or bellowed statement. It's been done three times. <br />
<br />
As for the content, it covers the war, as well as Monks, as well as Pandaria. It had action, humour and was a pleasure to watch.</div></div><hr />

An alliance and horde ship were just sunk, killing who knows how many on each side all with the bonds of brothers that only can develop through war-fighting being shattered, and then the Orc and Human suddenly team up against a random panda monk. <br />
<br />
Far from grounded seems like to me. Overlooking these complex relationships for a cute and fuzzy factor is exactly why this expansion doesn't cut it for me.</div></div><hr />

Vanilla, epic display of races and classes<br />
TBC, epic display of races and classes and Illidan (minus the mage polymorphing the tauren)<br />
Wotlk, epic display of the Lichking and Sindragosa, really showed how powerful the final bosses was going to be.<br />
Cata, epic display of Deathwing, pity his voice over was slightly crap<br />
MoP, Cool fight until the disney parts (straightening the bamboo signpost and the human handing the orc the spear) I liked it apart from those bits which I find to be more akin to an animated film like Sinbad rather than WoW :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Forgottenone</div><div class="date">2012-08-16, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I enjoyed the new cinematic but as others have said there is a clear difference between the Wotlk and Cata cinematic and the current one.<br />
<br />
The Wotlk was dead serious as we were facing an enemy who had the potential to destroy BOTH the Horde and Alliance and it was an enemy they had been building up for quite some time and a lot of people were very familiar with. The Cata cinematic was just as serious because once again we had an enemy whose power was beyond measure but this enemy wished to destroy all of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
I think it would have been neat if they had been able to show a large scale battle between the Horde and the Alliance as well as show Garrosh and Varian potentially clashing blades. In the end though I found this to be pretty amusing, though I would rank it as the 3rd best or 4th that doesn't mean it is shit because all the cinematics have been amazing in my eyes :3</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now don't get me wrong though! I still think that Blizzard could've done some certain things differently, I was expecting a feud between the Alliance and the Horde but on a much bigger scale rather than 2 warships, from which only one person emerges per ship..</div></div><hr />

Seeing as how one of their main goals is to bring back the idea of Horde vs. Alliance, this portrays what they want very well. At first, it gives you what the game started as: Horde vs. Alliance, fighting for control of everything everywhere. Then it tells you oh, here's some new potential friend/enemy that is as strong as you, and has a new world for you to conquer and explore. For what it is, it was entertaining and fun. You're entitled to your opinion though, however wrong it may be :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shepherd57</div><div class="date">2012-08-16, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I liked it. It shows the humans and orcs hate for each other. Rather than get accustomed to the new environment, both the orc and human hunt each other down for a fight. Captures the essence of the Pandaren. I thought is was a funny moment when the human handed the orc his weapon, but was it appropriate. On one hand we have countless instances where horde and alliance band together to fight a powerful foe, but I think as a human I might have taken that opprotunity to stab the orc and deal with the panda on my own or run away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no need for the pompous epicness. People got used to that because of WotLK and Cata where you had to be omfguberbadasshero to save the world from giant evil and shit. And this trailer definitely brings the feeling of WoW was supposed to be. Epic adventure? Yeah, but with a wink. For instance this is why WoW has this cartoon style graphics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it is you should have the dictionary handy, this is far better than the Wotlk or Cata's trailer. Then again why I am arguing with a clown with a name of Trollem, obvious you are not to be taken seriously, neither is your &quot;opinion.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Which is great when it's jackie chan. But in WoW? Eh. It's just a bit too fluffy for me. No &quot;You are not prepared&quot; moment. But that's just my 2p worth. I'm sure lots of people will love it, which is fine too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However. Initial athmosphere was copy-pasted directly from Pirates of the Caribbean. Then fight human vs. orc, that's new and awesome... oh wait. As soon as the panda enters it reminded mildly of a Disney Pixar feature, will all those fast movements and subtile small gags. I'd have avoided such references if I was Blizzard, but it seems they need stolen appeal even more. Then as the fog clears the &quot;plot&quot; of the trailer is abandoned and it ends with a panorama view of Pandaria, that's it. A propper conclusion is missing entirely.<br />
<br />
I'm not really disappointed since I didn't expect much. Well at least they didn't let me down on this.</div></div><hr />

This x100. The cinematic was O.K. but not as good as any of the other cinematics except vanilla, this was better. The big scary boss is what makes cinematics look really epic.<br />
<br />
Oh, and also, WTB Black 2 EU release !</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZeroEdgeir</div><div class="date">2012-08-16, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome trailer. Loved every bit of it.<br />
<br />
Was it a little cartoony/campy? Yeah. But that is a portion of Blizzard's modus operendi. Saying it's too &quot;Disney&quot; as someone above did... guess where they based that concept on? Other media that came before. It's not like Kung Fu Panda (which is Dreamworks btw, NOT Disney) invented everything to do with martial arts, and created many of the stereotypes we see. Hell, Jackie Chan, in MANY of his movies, aims to keep his environment undisturbed/undestroyed during fights, even putting things back as they get moved during it (despite someone inevitably breaking/destroying it ANYWAYS).<br />
<br />
It is traditional imagery that monks like things to be just perfect, everything in there place.<br />
<br />
As to the whole &quot;Where is the big bad guy?!&quot; - You saw em. Orcs and Humans. The War they bring to Pandaria. THAT is our big bad guy. Cause that War us causing the problems. It's not about a unified front against a common enemy. It is about dealing with each other. You won't see it AS much in launch content (5.0), but it will escalate in each patch, as it goes from expeditionary forces (5.0), to full military might.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lushious</div><div class="date">2012-08-16, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't like it much either, don't get me wrong, the animation and all was very impressive as always!<br />
I think it needed a bit magic, there were no spells even cast in the whole cinematic, I like magic :-(<br />
As also stated, I'd like to see just SOME of the enemies we will meet during MoP, to me it felt like all there is on that island, are the Pandarens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is why we don't over-hype things kids :) I'd also be willing to bet all of the &quot;WoW is dead for me&quot; people are still subbed and have pre-ordered MoP and are going to play it. Just stop expecting SOOO much all the time and actually appreciate things every now and then. It's okay to be positive and not grumpy and negative all the time :)</div></div><hr />
