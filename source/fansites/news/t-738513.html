Q. Will there be account-wide Achievements? If so, can we expect to see things like vanity gifts for having multiple characters? 
A. It&#8217;s an idea we definitely want to do, but it&#8217;s pretty challenging technically, so it&#8217;s not on the immediate horizon. We can&#8217;t promise anything obviously, but I wouldn&#8217;t feel the need to get difficult Achievements on more than one character on the same account.

Q. Will there be account-wide Achievements? If so, can we expect to see things like vanity gifts for having multiple characters?<br />
A. It&#8217;s an idea we definitely want to do, but it&#8217;s pretty challenging technically, so it&#8217;s not on the immediate horizon. We can&#8217;t promise anything obviously, but I wouldn&#8217;t feel the need to get difficult Achievements on more than one character on the same account. <br />
<br />
Q: What about some class specific quests for Cataclysm? I enjoyed them in the early levels of WoW!<br />
A: It&#8217;s very expensive to create class-specific raids given the literally thousands of new quests we are already adding for Cataclysm; however, we are going to have class-specific dungeon quests for everyone at levels 20 and 50. These won&#8217;t be as involved as, say, the old Benediction quest line, but they will give you a way to get some blue loot that isn&#8217;t otherwise available.<br />
<br />
Q: What are your thoughts on there being guild housing as a possible guild leveling reward?<br />
A. Our design dilemma with guild housing relates to what players might do in a guild house. If you generally hang out there, and have vendors and banks and Auction House access, then you stay there all the time and it makes the cities feel pretty dead. In a game with instanced dungeons and now phases, we are reluctant to provide more reasons for players to not see other players. It&#8217;s a social game! If we can come up with a good role for guild houses then we&#8217;ll definitely do them in the future.<br />
<br />
Q: Will WoW ever get a new weapon type?<br />
A. Doubtful.<br />
A #2. Tauren will be able to dual-wield gnomes on a stick. <br />
<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Q. With each expansion boss mechanics become more and more complex. Don't you think that bosses will be overcomplicated soon?<br />
A. We have a lot of players who have been killing bosses for six years now. We think we need to keep it fresh for them. Having normal vs. Hard modes is our way of making sure the complexity doesn&#8217;t make those fights inaccessible for some players.<br />
<br />
<br />
Player vs. Player<br />
Q. Are all characters getting 5% stun/fear reduction baseline since they are no longer talents?<br />
A. We would rather adjust the crowd control durations to appropriate levels. Currently some crowd-control effects are so easy to get out of that only really layered (using crowd control effects of different diminishing returns) really matters. We don&#8217;t want all of PvP to be kiting each other around with instant nukes and heals. Knowing what average durations are (rather than having some classes with duration reducers and some without) will let us judge the baseline better. We think players are individually just looking at their own trees now and thinking that they were made less powerful without realizing how across-the-board all the changes are. <br />
<br />
Q. Is your goal to not having to use a talent specialization solely for PvP? If so, please elaborate on how you plan to accomplish that?<br />
A. This is almost impossible to &#8220;fix.&#8221; With the nature of talents min/max will always be possible. That said, we&#8217;re trying to move away from having purely PvP or purely PvE talents as much as possible, which will make the pure PvP specializations less painful to play in PvE and vice versa.<br />
A #2. We are removing many of the PvP talents, as well as trying to make some of the PvP talents a little more useful for PvE (for example, a talent that currently procs on taking critical damage could instead proc on taking any damage, including AoE damage, as well). While we recognize that very competitive players might still want unique talent builds for PvP vs. PvE, the hope is that more players might be able to use the same specialization more often for multiple aspects of the game.<br />
<br />
Q: I PvP a lot in the level 10-19 bracket. What are some cool new abilities we'll see at level 10 in Warsong Gulch?<br />
A. Since all players will be getting a signature ability like Mortal Strike, Summon Water Elemental, or Mangle when choosing a specialization at level 10, we think players will see a lot of new abilities in the level 10-19 Warsong Gulch bracket that have never been seen before. <br />
A #2. Since all players will be getting a signature ability, such as Mortal Strike, Summon Water Elemental, and Mangle for picking a talent tree at level 10, I think there will be a lot of new abilities seen in the 10-19 Warsong Gulch that we never saw before. <br />
<br />
<br />
Classes - Damage Dealing<br />
Q. Will the ability to run while shooting effect PvP or PvE battles more? What was the initial intention of the new ability?<br />
A. With how encounters are today, damage-dealing while on the move is increasingly becoming important. You&#8217;ll see in a lot of classes we specifically are giving new ways for players to still do damage while on the move. That said, your damage while standing still casting or on a target in melee range should always be optimal.<br />
<br />
Classes - Healing<br />
Q. Some of the new talent trees for healers seem to emphasize a style of &quot;mana regeneration by dealing damage.&quot; Is that intentional? If so, why?<br />
A. Yes. In almost any situation, there are periods where heals are not urgently needed 100% of the time. Today, you probably just cast heals anyway in case someone takes damage, since mana doesn&#8217;t matter much. But if mana did matter, the &#8220;right&#8221; thing to do would be to do nothing. Talents such as Telluric Currents provide an active way to recharge mana while contributing damage.<br />
<br />
Q: Do you expect anyone, alts or new players, to level as a healer specialization? Do you think locking them to Holy or Restoration early is bad?<br />
A. We expect leveling with as DPS will probably always be more efficient, just because killing things is faster than surviving longer while you kill things. Furthermore, we don&#8217;t want the healing specializations to be as good at killing things or the DPS specialization not to have a role. We do, however, think we can make leveling as a healer more enjoyable than it is today. Also, it will be a lot easier to use Dungeon Finder to level as a healer.<br />
<br />
Classes - Tanking<br />
Q: Any plan to make &quot;Crit Immunity&quot; passive from choosing a tank tree instead of spending talents on it?<br />
A. No, and you can blame the druids. We want a tanking specialization in Bear Form to feel different from a DPS specialization in Cat Form, otherwise it doesn&#8217;t feel fair to other classes when the Feral druid can do everything with the same talent specialization. We try to put crit immunity in talents you would normally take.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes - 31-Point Talent Trees and Masteries<br />
Q. With the 31-point tree, many talents still cost two or three points. Is this going to be changed, as it basically increases their cost?<br />
A. For the most part, yes. There are some overpowered talents that don&#8217;t need the boost, but many of the others will have their effects increased.<br />
<br />
Q. How do the mastery bonuses work now that they don't show up on the talent interface anymore?<br />
A. The mastery bonuses will be trainable passive bonuses somewhere around level 75. Each talent specialization will have a different Mastery available on the trainer with a base potency with 0 Mastery Rating. The character sheet interface will have additional information on the additional potency gained from Mastery Rating. <br />
<br />
Q. If every specialization is intended to take their 31-point talent, why is it not baseline at the level you could acquire it?<br />
A. Those talents are a good &#8220;brass ring&#8221; to work towards. They often change your character pretty dramatically when you get them, so it&#8217;s a fun moment. There is definitely an interesting philosophical discussion about talent trees and how many talents should be mandatory vs. optional. Some players would like a model where everything is on equal footing with everything else. Others want to make sure there are some safe decisions so that they don&#8217;t have to do tons of theory-crafting research every time they talent their character. We are trying to shoot for something in the middle where we have some expectation for how a particular spec will play (for example, we don&#8217;t want to have to develop and support the non-Chaos Bolt Destruction rotation) but players can still decide if say Blitz is something their Arms warrior will use or not.<br />
<br />
Q: How will pets scale with Mastery their masters' Mastery?<br />
A. The talent specializations that rely heavily on pets (Beast Mastery and Demonology, for example) have a Mastery that makes Mastery rating also increase pet damage. Other specializations that have pets, but whose pets do not benefit from Mastery, will have their Masteries balanced accordingly, taking into account that pets will not benefit from them. <br />
<br />
Q: Will there be a &quot;hard cap&quot; for Mastery rating (to avoid having 101% chance of getting a critical block, for example)?<br />
A, In the course of finalizing all of the Masteries for the various talent specializations, we will make sure that, in the expected gear a player can acquire from the final Cataclysm raid tiers, the player will not crash into a &quot;hard cap&quot; unless they go out of their way to stack Mastery more than is reasonable. This may require redesigning some of the Masteries as the rest of the class designs are finalized.<br />
<br />
Q: Ever thought of changing tiers to unlock with 3 Points instead of 5, now that 5 tier talents are gone?<br />
A. We considered this idea, but ultimately decided against it.<br />
<br />
Q: Are we going to be able to view the Mastery talent previews for Cataclysm soon as we can currently?<br />
A. With the talent tree redesign, all the Masteries need to be re-implemented, and, in some cases, redesigned. This will require at least a couple of weeks before they will be available on beta. <br />
<br />
Q: Can you provide some clarity on the 3rd Mastery that is affected item stats?<br />
A. We recognized the earlier implementation of Mastery in the beta was confusing. Mastery is no longer directly associated with a talent tree, but is instead a passive effect learned from a trainer at a later level. That passive effect will now grant the third Mastery bonus you formerly saw in the talent tree pane. The passive effect will have a base value, and then Mastery rating will increase that effect further. The other two Mastery bonuses previously listed at the top of the talent tree pane have been removed, but, in some cases, have been reimplemented as passive specialization bonuses. Currently, in the beta, you cannot see any of the Masteries, as they need to be reimplemented after the talent tree redesign.<br />
<br />
Q. Why not make each tier a 3-point system instead of 5 to advance?<br />
A. We considered this and decided against it. <br />
<br />
Q. Will we see these talent changes in Wrath of the Lich King, before the release of Cataclysm, like we did with the last expansion?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
<br />
Q: It was said that players would be allowed to choose based on their play style. Do you believe fewer talents will accomplish this?<br />
A. The talents that we are pruning are typically things like extra strength or coefficient boosts to spells. It&#8217;s hard to have a different play style based on talents like that. We are trying to keep the talents that really change gameplay. A Retribution paladin that feels like he can help out healing on 5-player dungeon runs might take the two-point talent to improve healing. A Protection warrior who tanks a lot of 5-player dungeons might want talents that help with AoE pulls, while one that is a raid off-tank might want, say, Safeguard and Vigilance instead.<br />
<br />
Q: With the new 31-point tree system, how will players use dual-specialization? Do we get to choose a new tree when we first use our secondary specialization (off-spec)?<br />
A. You can use dual-specialization for a different specialization in beta, if you choose, much as you can today. We are going to lower the level at which you can use dual-specialization, as well as the cost for purchasing it, because we recognize that using Dungeon Finder while leveling is likely to be popular.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes - General<br />
Q. Have some of the old talents been made into new glyphs?<br />
A. Usually when we cut a talent it&#8217;s because we thought it was a bad talent, but we might bring some talents that were so situational to fit in the new model back as glyphs. We are still designing glyphs. Players shouldn&#8217;t necessarily assume that any of their current glyphs are going to still be around. Some will, but many are changing.<br />
<br />
Q: How much of an impact will the new medium glyphs have on the fun factor of choices in the new 31-point talent trees?<br />
A. We hope it adds a lot. Part of the problem is that if there is, say, a Glyph of Mutilate, you feel like you have to take that as an Assassination rogue over anything else. The Medium glyphs are designed to let you customize your character a little more. They are the glyphs you would take if Mutilate didn&#8217;t exist.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, the new tiers are called Prime, Major, and Minor. Majors are the new Mediums. Glyph of Mutilate would be a Prime.<br />
<br />
Q. In general, do you expect mana-saving talents to be something all players take, or are they designed to be optional utility?<br />
A. For healers, we expect players will take most of these talents (maybe not the ones related to taking damage or dealing damage though). For non-healers, we make sure all of them have reasonably reliable ways to restore mana, but these often come with the potential for damage-dealing loss. In that vein, the mana-saving talents can be thought of as damage-dealing talents, and nukers can take them if they think they impact their bottom line. After all, we all know that the only thing that matters at the end of the day is who won the meters. :)<br />
<br />
Q: What class are you currently most happy with how the talents are currently set up? Is there one you feel needs more work?<br />
A. They all need more work! <br />
<br />
Q: Are there plans to give more procs to some classes to make the rotations a little more interesting?<br />
A. Yea, for classes or specializations that need them. Paladins are getting a few.<br />
A #2. Sure, we want all specializations to have interesting rotations. There is a point though when you can be overwhelmed by the amount of procs going on and the gameplay becomes erratic and not very fun. So it&#8217;s a constant balance between the two.<br />
<br />
Q. Will we be seeing more talents that reward use of rarely used spells (i.e. Destruction now opens with Soul Fire, barely used before)?<br />
A. Talents like this are intended to be used as openers for PvE, or for target-swapping in PvE and PvP. There are a lot of encounters where you have to kill newly spawned monsters as soon as possible, which these talents are great for. Or, when you need to change targets in PvP on a high health mob, boom instant critical with Improved Feral Charge, Careful Aim, or haste with Improved Soul Fire. <br />
A #2. Given the scarcity of action bar space, rarely used abilities are generally becoming more appealing or being cut from the game entirely.<br />
<br />
Q. Can we expect more fun talents and maybe even shiny new abilities in further iterations of the new talent trees?<br />
A. Yes, the current beta trees are still very much works in progress. As paladins in particular will see shortly, that ongoing work certainly can include fun talents and shiny new abilities.<br />
<br />
Q: What is the conversion rate for intellect to spell power for Cataclysm? Will it differ with each class?<br />
A. Each point of intellect grants one point of spell power, excepting the first 10 points. This is vaguely similar to attack power, where each point of strength or agility gives two attack power, excepting the first 10 points.<br />
<br />
We realize this slightly reduces the spell power per budget on items, so we also increased the amount of spell power granted by caster weapons, and that increase entirely makes up for the deficit. Those weapons will continue to have spell power as well as intellect, and the amount of spell power will be significantly larger than in 3.3.5.<br />
<br />
Q. How will brand new players know what a good leveling specialization is? Are they expected to know what site to visit and read up?<br />
A. We believe that the new talent tree design will make it much easier for a neophyte player to pick a talent specialization and navigate its talent tree successfully with a viable specialization.<br />
A #2. We hope that most talent builds are decent for leveling. Giving players a good ability at level 10 definitely helps with this. We are trying to avoid the traps of bad talents by just removing them altogether (Unbridled Wrath, RIP).<br />

Q. Is there any intent to bring back the On A Pale Horse talent for Death Knights, possibly in a different tree?<br />
A. Yes, On a Pale Horse is back as a sub-specialization-accessible Frost talent in our latest internal build.<br />
<br />
Q. What is the intent and thoughts on changing the rune cost of Scourge Strike?<br />
A. In Wrath of the Lich King, it is closer to being a clone of Obliterate with a slightly different feel than we&#8217;d like. We want to change that. We&#8217;re also very aware of the rotational problems inherent in decoupling the Unholy and Frost runes. Rest assured, our solution will not be expecting you to Icy Touch alongside each Scourge Strike.<br />
<br />
Q. Death knight tanks in Cataclysm seem to be gaining a lot of defensive buttons. As a death knight I love it, but will those numbers be changing soon?<br />
A. It&#8217;s possible that some of it may need to be scaled back, but we like the cooldown aspect of death knight tanking and would like to preserve it.<br />
<br />
Q. Since implementing and receiving feedback on the new death knight rune system, have you made any changes to it you can reveal to us?<br />
A. It still needs a lot of iteration. We don&#8217;t want there to be significant &#8220;dead time&#8221; in death knight rotations. Also, the Runic Empowerment ability has some bugs with displaying the current state of available runes, which complicate the situation. Look for more death knight changes in the near future.<br />
<br />
Q. Do you plan to give the Unholy tree a more centralized focus, instead of split between Scourge Strike, diseases, ghoul, auto-attack, Anti-Magic Shell?<br />
A. In a sense, that IS a centralized focus. Unholy death knights are about diseases and Unholy pets. Frost is about icy attacks and runic power. Blood is about tanking and self-healing.<br />
<br />
Q. Dark Simulacrum for death knight has a pretty long cooldown. What's the reasoning behind that exactly? (just curious)<br />
A. It&#8217;s been reduced to 1 minute in the latest build, but it&#8217;s also an extremely powerful ability with which we expect players to pull off fun and scary things. <br />
<br />
Q. Is there a plan to support dual-wield tanking for death knights (something like Threat of Thassarian versus Might of Frozen Wastes)?<br />
A. It will be technically possible to dual wield and tank, but it will not be optimal threat-wise.<br />
<br />
Q. Death knights are the only tanks without a stun, which is pretty key for a few things, like adds on Heroic Lich King. Any plans to give them one?<br />
A. There&#8217;s a video of a death knight solo-tanking 10-player Heroic Lich King. Impressive stuff. But just like stuns are incredibly good on Lich King, there are a number of fights where mechanics like Death Grip, or the ability to pre-drop a Death and Decay to pick up spawning adds, are incredibly useful. That&#8217;s part of class and encounter diversity.<br />
<br />
Q. It seems that our DPS with Runic Empowerment is very random, will that be changed?<br />
A. Runic Empowerment is being changed to a trained ability so that all specializations can access it without feeling forced to, since we see it as a core part of death knight gameplay in Cataclysm. The way the talent is engineered, it should never disrupt your rotation, but rather give you bonus resources layered on top of your rotation. The proc rate is high enough that the actual variability in procs over time shouldn&#8217;t be excessive. <br />
<br />

Q. Will druids finally get shapeshifting on a separate global cooldown like hunter aspects &amp; warrior stances?<br />
A. We have no plans to remove shapeshifting from the global cooldown. Shapeshifting can be used to escape Root and Polymorph mechanics, and so cannot have no global cooldown.<br />
<br />
Q. Is Moonfire designed to be a damage-over-time spell with an instant cast nuke, or the other way around?<br />
A. Both. We want the instant nuke to be more meaningful in Cataclysm, especially on the move.<br />
<br />
Q: Cat and Bear builds are only off by about 3 talent points. Why not just consolidate fully at that point?<br />
A. This is definitely one of our concerns. We don&#8217;t want a player to be able to have an optimal DPS specialization in Cat Form and be able to tank. We will definitely engineer the Feral tree such that being a viable tank, or even off-tank, will have some cost in terms of lost DPS while in Cat Form. The druid talent trees currently in beta are very rough and need more polish. <br />
<br />
Q: Will Arcane spells do more damage with higher Lunar power on the scale? And will more Mastery increase that bonus damage?<br />
A. Currently, the plan is for Mastery to increase the damage bonus of Eclipse (both Lunar and Solar).<br />
<br />
Q. Last time I checked the Feral druid tree, there were only 5 points in the first tier which means NO choices. Is that getting fixed?<br />
A. Still working on early Feral.<br />
<br />
Q: Last time I checked feral druid tree, there were only 5 points in the first tier which means NO choices. Is that getting fixed?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
<br />
Q. What's the deal with Typhoon? Is it going back into talents or will it be a standard druid spell?<br />
A. Typhoon is now back in the tree. Sorry about that. :)<br />
<br />
Q. Druids now get Swiftmend at level 10 for being Restoration, but it is a talent in the tree. What is the plan there?<br />
A. This was a data error and has been corrected.<br />
<br />
Q: Any word on that cosmetic Tree of Life Form glyph? Some players are sad to lose Tree of Life Form completely.<br />
A. The only new glyph we are ready to announce right now is the Glyph of Divine Shield, which reduces the cast time of your Hearthstone whenever Divine Shield is active. ;)<br />
<br />
Q. Druids were always a &quot;jack of all trades, but master of none&quot; and usually mocked when specializing. Will new talents change this?<br />
A. In my own raids, I find druids of all 3 specializations that excel at their chosen specialization. So, I don&#8217;t understand your question.<br />
<br />
Q. Why was the Feral druid's mana reduction cost removed from King of the Jungle? And what happened to two combo points on critical strikes?<br />
A. These are data errors that will be corrected. Neither is intended to be cut. <br />
<br />
Q: Moonkin: What are your plans for Eclipse, and why does it infect so many of our talents? What are your plans to make Moonkin fun?<br />
A. The model we are trying now lets Solar and Lunar Eclipse procs last for about 45 seconds, and each spell of the appropriate type that you cast moves the bar back closer to the middle again. The buff is canceled by reaching the middle. This should let Moonkin &quot;hold&quot; the buff for short periods of time when they need to move or get out of the fire.<br />
<br />

The buff is canceled by reaching the middle. This should let Moonkin &quot;hold&quot; the buff for short periods of time when they need to move or get out of the fire.<br />
<br />
Q. Skull Bash has a 1-minute cooldown. Is it supposed to be that way, or can we expect it to be lowered to the likes of Shield Bash?<br />
A. The base cooldown is 60 seconds to keep the ability from being used by Balance and Restoration druids to layer too much crowd control. A Feral tree talent reduces the cooldown to 10 seconds, putting it in line with Kick and other similar interrupt abilities. <br />

Q. What is the design choice behind the focus recharge in Aspect of Fox, is it meant to replace Viper?<br />
A. Aspect of the Fox is intended to be used for mobile damage or kiting. There is still some tuning to be done on Focus and this aspect, but that is the design goal.<br />
<br />
Q. Will Hunters be able to pet-tank through cata (even if just beast masters)?<br />
A. What, you didn&#8217;t see that video where some guy tanked Marowgar with his Gorilla? <br />
<br />
Q. How are you trying to separate the play styles of the hunter specializations? What makes Cobra Shot feel different from Steady Shot?<br />
A. Cobra Shot is ideal for Beast Mastery and Survival hunters because they don&#8217;t really have any other way of keeping Serpent Sting up (Cobra Shot extends Serpent Sting&#8217;s duration), and also for Survival because it is &#8220;Elemental&#8221; damage. It's also useful in PvP or in some other niche situations, say, when a creature is immune to physical damage. Now you have a solution.<br />
<br />
Q. Concerning Marksmanship hunters, why is the PvP talent Resistance is Futile a prerequisite for PvE talent Marked for Death?<br />
A. In an upcoming build it won&#8217;t be a prerequisite, and we want to change it to proc a free Kill Command instead of an instant critical.<br />
<br />

Q. Will each Mage talent tree be on a level PvE and PvP footing, or do you plan to make them bias to specific modes?<br />
A. The idea is to make them have equal footing. If that doesn&#8217;t work out, then we would prefer for one specialization to not be completely dead. But we want, for example, for players to choose Frost because they like Frost. <br />
<br />
Q. Will mages get pets for Arcane and Fire specializations at any time?<br />
A. No.<br />

Q. Any thought to having Retribution paladins use spell power plate to help put Holy paladins on equal footing as other healers?<br />
A. We think Retribution paladins needs to use strength plate. Changing this would require a lot of funky solutions, such as how we handle Crusader Strike damage, and trying to control Retribution from being too powerful a healer. We realize it&#8217;s odd to itemize spell power plate for one specialization, but we think all of the solutions to this issue are worse than just living with it. <br />
<br />
Q: What is the goal when re-designing the paladin class? How do you plan to change rotations, talents, etc?<br />
A. All of the paladin specializations will make use of a new resource called Holy Power. Holy Power accumulates from using Crusader Strike, Holy Shock, and some other talents. Holy Power can be consumed to augment a variety of abilities, including:<br />
<br />
An instant mana-free heal: Word of Glory<br />
A buff to increase holy damage done: Inquisition<br />
A massive physical melee attack for Retribution paladins: Templar&#8217;s Verdict<br />
Holy Shield&#8217;s duration is now extended by Holy Power<br />
Divine Storm&#8217;s damage is now increased by Holy Power<br />
<br />
<br />
We also introduced several new heals for Holy Paladins including Healing Hands (an AoE heal-over-time that is applied to all players standing near the paladin), Light of Dawn (a cone heal with a 30-yard range), as well as a new heal called Divine Light, which is similar to a priest's Greater Heal, and the new instant heal mentioned above, Word of Glory.<br />
<br />
Q: Are Protection paladins still going to refresh Divine Plea on melee hit (via a talent or trained ability)?<br />
A. Yes.<br />
<br />
Q: Can you give us a sneak peek at one or two of the new Retribution abilities or talents?<br />
A. Templar&#8217;s Verdict: An instant weapon attack that causes a percentage of weapon damage. Consumes all applications of Holy Power to increase damage dealt:<br />
<br />
1 Holy Power: 55% Weapon Damage<br />
2 Holy Power: 125% Weapon Damage<br />
3 Holy Power: 225% Weapon Damage<br />
<br />
<br />
Word of Glory: Consumes all Holy Power to heal a friendly target for a specific amount per application of Holy Power (0 mana cost, 0 cooldown, instant cast).<br />
<br />
Q: If Judgement of Wisdom is being removed from the game, are paladins getting a new Judgement so we don't all have to use Judgement of Light?<br />
A. There will only be one Judgement spell. This spell places a single debuff on the target with the effects currently associated with Judgement of Light and Judgement of Justice. The Judgement of Wisdom effect has been retired completely.<br />
<br />
Q: Are the improved aura talents going away? They were still present in beta.<br />
A. If you mean talents like Improved Devotion Aura, then those are gone. We still have talents that, say, increase healing on targets of your auras. Improved Concentration Aura still exists. In genera, though, you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about having raid buffs of different power competing with each other. <br />
<br />
Q. Are Protection Paladins still going to refresh Divine Plea on melee hit (via a talent or trained ability)?<br />
A. Yes.<br />

Q. Why is Vampiric Touch being changed back after the 3.0 Replenishment revamp?<br />
A. Talents like these are still in development flux. Players should expect most abilities to stay generally the same as they are today. For example, when revamping the trees we changed some ranks of talents down from five points to three, and didn&#8217;t re-balance the talent for three points. Most five-pointers that become three-pointers will be as strong as they were when they were five-pointers.<br />
<br />
Q. I'm excited about the Smite mechanic in Disc. Are you going to do anything about hit so that mechanic can be effective?<br />
A. We had a talent to give you a bunch of spell hit in a beta build, but spell hit on your offensive spells is a hard sell in the new talent model. But yes, we want to do something about spell hit for the Discipline Archangel specialization, possibly move up Twisting Faith to a tier that Discipline can obtain it in Shadow (so your spirit would convert to hit as Discipline/Shadow sub-specialization).<br />
<br />
Q. Please talk about Lightwell. There has been much wailing about it on priest forums. Are you intent on keeping it in?<br />
A. Lightwell is complicated because it deals very much with the healing philosophy we&#8217;re trying to resurrect in Cataclysm. Remember when your raid would make a conscious effort to survive before doing damage, would bring stacks of bandages and use them throughout the fight to save their healers mana? Lightwell is very strong &#8211; if not overpowered &#8211; in that environment. <br />
<br />
Q. Will Holy priests get some fun talents, like Evangelism and Archangel in the Discipline tree? At the moment it will be expensive for Holy to take those.<br />
A. While we still have a ways to go in design on the talents, we want Holy to be able to also do an Archangel sub-specialization if they wish. In some ways it may be stronger than the Discipline main specialization version. <br />
<br />
Q. Where do you see priests fitting in the healing world? They seem very 'jack of all, master of none' with the new trees.<br />
A. It&#8217;s difficult to judge healer strength right now, as all spells are still going to be tweaked with good mana cost/healing amounts. We will say we want both priest healing specializations to be unique, powerful and fun.<br />
<br />
Q: Will Leap of Faith get some sort of secondary buff? Pulling a high aggro target to a clothie healer seems dangerous<br />
A. This ability is intended to save party and raid members from imminent danger,such as pulling someone out of a fire that would otherwise kill them. It does not need a secondary buff.<br />
<br />
Q. A lot of Shadow priests' talents seem mandatory. Any chance for a trimmed down tree? We feel like we need to pick all of them.<br />
A. Some changes are underway for Shadow priest trees.<br />
<br />
Q. Still &quot;un-fun&quot; talents in the 3-point trees like Spirit Tap. Are damage-dealing specialization mana regeneration talents that may feel mandatory staying in game?<br />
A. Spirit Tap and other purely &#8220;leveling talents&#8221; are being re-evaluated.<br />
<br />
Q. Power Infusion: not in beta talents. Coming back, or gone for good?<br />
A. If it&#8217;s not in your build, that&#8217;s a bug! It&#8217;ll be back.<br />
<br />

Q. How does Smoke Bomb help me take on a Frost mage? Isn't Blizzard a pretty trivial counter to keep me in combat?<br />
A. Keep you in combat, perhaps. But Frostbolt you? Polymorph you to stop you from killing the stunned healer that you just shrouded in smoke? Nope!<br />
<br />
Q. What's the plan to give Subtlety some pressure versus plate? A slow-ticking Rupture isn't going to cut it. Shadow damage during Dance?<br />
A. That&#8217;s an interesting idea. Subtlety is probably going to end up as the lowest-damage of the three rogue specializations to make up for its superior mobility, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it's harmless, either. And no, Rupture isn&#8217;t intended to be the PvP solution to that situation. <br />
<br />
Q. The Combat tree seems really lackluster; i was taking talents like +armor and Recuperate to fill up my tree. Any plans to buff it?<br />
A. If you were able to spend all 41 points on nothing but increasing your damage, we&#8217;d consider that a failure in our current design, because those would be the only choices. But with &#8220;utility&#8221;; talents there&#8217;s no clear answer -- some rogues, even serious raiding min/max types, might have preferred to be able to use Sprint more often rather than taking Reinforced Leather, for example. In the end, we&#8217;ll make sure you&#8217;re able to do the damage you need to do, in order to have fun and feel competitive in all aspects of the game.<br />
<br />
Q. Recuperate makes me feel like a tiny unkillable god of death. ...you aren't going to nerf this are you?<br />
A. Wait, but it doesn&#8217;t make you hit harder, so how can it be overpowered? <br />
<br />
Q. How do you optimize the sub-specialization choices for an Assassination rogue? Some needed talents are not reachable in the current trees.<br />
A. Right now you have to spend too many talent points to get all the &#8220;essential&#8221; Assassination talents. You end up taking pretty much the entire bottom half of the tree. In the next build, things have been streamlined a little so that you should be able to credibly take spend 31 points there.<br />

Q. Do you consider Primal Wisdom or Shamanistic Rage &quot;required&quot; so Enhancement shaman won't run out of mana? Is running out of mana intended to be a danger?<br />
A. Yes, once high-level Enhancement shaman have all their abilities and are using them in sequence, Primal Wisdom will be required to sustain a rotation. We&#8217;d like to let shaman use Shamanistic Rage for survival or emergency situations, rather than assuming rotational use for mana. <br />
<br />
Q. With the new implemented Lava Surge, will Chain Lightning become useful for multiple mobs only?<br />
A. It always has had, and will continue to have, some niche use as a gap-filler against single targets when Lava Burst has around a second left on its cooldown. Lava Surge won&#8217;t always proc, but it&#8217;s likely to be more of a multi-target ability, yes.<br />
<br />
Q. Will Spirit Link make a return after all? Ghostcrawler mentioned he'd like to bring it back, but no sighting of it yet.<br />
A. Anything&#8217;s possible, but at this point it isn&#8217;t looking good for our beloved talent&#8230;. If we changed it to be an absorb or a different sort of mechanic, then it wouldn&#8217;t be the iconic Spirit Link that we all remember from Warcraft III. But that core damage-sharing mechanic poses major design and balance challenges (e.g. does a rogue really want to start taking damage suddenly because the shaman in his group decided to link him to the tank?). <br />
<br />
Q. With Elemental Fury becoming a passive for Elemental shaman, will Enhancement be seeing more physical based damage?<br />
A. Spells like Lava Burst and shocks will always be a big part of Enhancement&#8217;s damage, but yes, we&#8217;d like weapon attacks like Stormstrike and Lava Lash to be a larger part of Enhancement Shamans&#8217; damage in Cataclysm. N.B.: Mental Quickness is getting a boost to help compensate for the loss of Elemental Fury.<br />
<br />
Q. Are there any plans of making totems utility only (e.g. Earthbind, Grounding) and turning buff totems into auras or cast buffs?<br />
A. Not at this time. We&#8217;re aware of the concerns regarding the use of buff totems among some shaman, but the positional aspect is something that we consider inherent to the nature of totems. By increasing totem durations, consolidating some buff totems, and introducing the multi-drop totem spells in Wrath of the Lich King, we&#8217;ve attempted to mitigate as much of the inconvenience as possible, while preserving the core gameplay of paying attention to where totems are being dropped. <br />
<br />
Q. How does Deep Healing work? Will it heal severely less at high health that it is difficult to keep a target at a safe level of health?<br />
A. No, view it as a perk that boosts your heals when that extra healing is most needed. It&#8217;s a class-specific bonus, so healing overall won&#8217;t be balanced around the expectation that Deep Healing applies.<br />

Q. How will the Demon Soul talent work? Is it like a replacement for Demonology's Metamorphosis, another cooldown to pop, or...?<br />
A. While Demonology has potentially two (with Metamorphosis and Demonic Empowerment), warlocks in general usually don&#8217;t have a power-up ability they can cast for burst damage in PvP or PvE. This is what it is intended to be.<br />
<br />
Q. Can we finally have Soul Link baseline, or at least give each tree its own defense mechanic so that we aren't forced into Demonology for PvP?<br />
A. It is a possibility, we&#8217;re still talking about it.<br />
<br />
Q. Can Master Summoner become default for all warlocks? 6-second cast time is long enough for a pet.<br />
A. But how often are you summoning a pet? You can also use a shard to summon one instantly. We want killing a warlock's pet in PvP to be a meaningful investment of time and effort, and likewise we want summoning/resurrecting your pet to be a meaningful investment of time and effort. <br />
<br />
Q. You've stated warlock trees have a way to go. Any plans you'd like to share? Early Demonology in specific seems really boring.<br />
A. The first two tiers of all specializations are intended to be what we call &#8220;scaling talents,&#8221; or general percentage modifiers on abilities. Consider them entry-level talents -- easy to understand for newer players and good sub-specialization candidates. That said, a lot of early Demonology talents have changed in an upcoming build.<br />
<br />
Q. Any plans to alleviate Affliction's target-switching woes? Bane of Havoc used to be in reach of all specializations. Now it's only for Destruction.<br />
A. Maaaybe. <br />
<br />
Q. What are you planning for Doomguard and Infernal? That Demonology talent is quite... strange.<br />
A. Look now, they are now&#8230; Diamonds. I mean, guardians. The Doomguard does strong ranged damage and the Infernal is good for area-of-effect damage. They're shared cooldowns, so it's your choice which you want to use. 10-minute cooldown. No more stones or figurines! <br />
<br />

Q. Will rend (sigh) be refreshed by Thunderclap on all targets used with Blood and Thunder?<br />
A. Yes. The idea is that you Rend once and then Thunder Clap from then on. We still hope it&#8217;s an optional talent, not the only way warriors can AoE tank.<br />
<br />
Q. Slam's design is pretty archaic and not very fun. Is there any chance of Slam becoming an instant-attack baseline ability?<br />
A. We think it makes the ability feel different. Slam as an instant attack isn&#8217;t very different from some of the other attacks. As it&#8217;s designed though, Fury shouldn&#8217;t use Slam at all without procs and Arms should only use it with the Improved Slam talent. We tried (briefly) making Slam a low-level ability, but weren&#8217;t happy with it.<br />
<br />
Q: Are Fury Warriors still going to see a new attack to fill the loss of Whirlwind? Any insight?<br />
A. Yes! It&#8217;s called Raging Blow (at least for the moment), because we wanted to distance is a little from the old Enraged Assault. It's Fury-only and can only be used when Enraged, but does not consume the Enrage. It does indeed strike with both weapons (including the animation).<br />
<br />
Q: Will Whirlwind still be a part of a Fury warrior's rotation on single mobs or will it be multi-mobs only?<br />
A. Multiple mobs only.<br />
<br />
Q: Concussion Blow is rarely used these days outside of PvP. Any plans for it? Will you unlink it from Vigilance?<br />
A. It&#8217;s pretty useful on Mr. Lich King&#8230;.<br />
<br />
Q: How is Heroic Leap working so far? Is it progressing better than your last attempt at putting it in-game?<br />
A. We&#8217;re pretty happy with it so far. The version we have right now lets the warrior target where they want to leap, so they can use it as an escape tool as well. We all know paladins would never retreat from a battle, but warriors have been known to do so.<br />
<br />
Q. Why does fury have two 31-point talents? Wouldn't it be simpler to merge them so one doesn't have to re-specialize when new weapons drop?<br />
A. We feel the decision on which of these two talents to choose is based on play style (two fast weapons, or two slow two-handed weapons), not based on which weapons most recently dropped (like the former Arms weapon specialization talents which have been cut).<br />
<br />
We expect the player to decide which type of dual wielder they are and collect weapons and gear that fit that type.<br />
<br />
Q: What do you think warriors will be more unique for in PvP now that Mortal Strike is available to other classes and reduced to 20%?<br />
A. We don&#8217;t think warriors need a unique ability that is so awesome that you just have to have a warrior on your Arena team. That is bad mojo for all the other classes. We do want warriors to be useful in PvP, however. One ability we are trying out for Arms is &quot;Throwdown,&quot; which lets them knock an opponent to the ground for five seconds. Since it&#8217;s usable in Battle Stance, they can also use it as a Pummel in a pinch.<br />
<br />
Q: You mentioned Disarming Glare isn't likely to make it. Could you expand on this a bit?<br />
A. We cut it in exchange for the Throwdown talent above.<br />
<br />
Q: Why does Fury have two 31-point talents? Wouldn't it be simpler to merge them so one doesn't have to re-specialize when new weapons drop?<br />
A. We view swapping from two-handed to one-handed weapons as more of a play style choice than swapping from mace to axe because the axe has more DPS. You are rarely going to be in a situation where a boss drops two one-handed weapons that are superior to your two-handed weapon.<br />
<br />
Q: Hi, it's me Rend! I'm sort of terrible, but if tanks are having to use me in Cataclysm, may I be a good ability now?!<br />
A. Get back to the back of the bus, Rend.<br />
<br />
In all seriousness, though, we don&#8217;t want Rend to be the answer to Protection warrior threat. It isn&#8217;t going to keep mobs glued to you. We do think we have room to boost its damage though, even for warriors with a DPS specialization. One change we&#8217;ve made is letting it do a tick of damage immediately, so that you see and feel damage right on the application instead of waiting for the first tick.<br />
<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
Q: Are there any plans to add Ghostcrawler in-game as a critter or elite crab?<br />
A. Ghostcrawler would be very emo were he to gaze down from his Throne of Lies and behold the mass crustacean slaughter that would result in having more manifestations of his persona in the game. <br />
<br />
Q: I don't care about Real ID, new talent points, or ponies, but I must have a double rainbow in a city so all can bask in its glory!<br />
A. Due to company policy, I&#8217;m afraid we must reserve all rainbows for our friends working on Diablo III.<br />
<br />
Q: Let's talk fashion. Any chance we could get a tophat AND monocle to display at the same time?<br />
A. Why, yes. Indubitably. Tut-tut, my good chap and cheerio! <br />
<br />
Q: So, Worgen get top hats, and that's awesome. Are there any plans to give Goblins something cool? Maybe those sunglasses?<br />
A. Quadruple pigtails maybe? <br />
<br />
Q: What size shoes does Ghostcrawler wear?<br />
A. I generally go barefoot on the yacht. Around on the office, I am often carried on gnome palanquin, so shoes are not required. <br />

Answers to Common Community Questions Real ID<br />
Answers to Common Community Questions About Real ID&#8482;<br />
<br />
Since the launch of the Real ID&#8482; system in World of Warcraft®, we&#8217;ve received a number of questions from the community about our plans for the service, features like StarCraft® II&#8217;s Facebook® integration, and how we see Real ID evolving in the future. We've been keeping tabs on the conversations on our forums, social media sites, and fansites, and have compiled some of the most common questions to answer for you here. We hope you find this information helpful, and we look forward to hearing your feedback and continuing the conversation in the thread below.<br />
<br />
Q: Do you have any plans to allow players to not show their real name to friends of friends while using the Real ID system?<br />
A: As with any new feature we add to our games, we've been evaluating how Real ID has been used since its release to identify new functionality that would help improve our players&#8217; experience. The in-game Real ID &#8220;friends of friends&#8221; list is designed to give players a convenient way to populate their Real ID friends list with other players they know and trust in real life, allowing them to quickly and easily send Real ID friend requests to these people without having to enter their Battle.net® account names. However, we recognize that some players would prefer not to be displayed on friends lists in this fashion, so we plan to include an option that will allow players to opt out of appearing on their Real ID friends&#8217; &#8220;friends of friends&#8221; lists. We're anticipating this feature to be available for StarCraft II shortly after release of the game, and World of Warcraft at around the same time -- we&#8217;ll have more information for you in the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
Q: What are your plans for Facebook integration?<br />
A: With regard to Facebook, our goal is to help Blizzard gamers on Battle.net more easily connect to their real-life friends and family. For the launch of StarCraft II, we are introducing an optional Facebook friend finder feature to help achieve this goal. The friend finder enables players who decide to use it to easily populate their Battle.net friends list by sending Real ID friend requests to the people on their Facebook friends list who have Battle.net accounts. We hope players will find this feature convenient, but it's completely optional. In the long term, we hope to give players who use Facebook some fun, and also optional, ways to share what they're doing in Blizzard games with their friends, similar to the optional World of Warcraft Armory integration now available, but we don&#8217;t have any specific plans to share at present.<br />
<br />
Q: How does the friend finder in StarCraft II work? What's sent to Facebook?<br />
A: When you use the Add a Friend feature in StarCraft II, one of the options you&#8217;ll see is to search your Facebook friends list for people who also have Battle.net accounts in order to quickly send them Real ID friend requests. When you click this button, you'll be asked to enter your Facebook login information, and you&#8217;ll then see a list of your Facebook friends who also have Battle.net accounts. You&#8217;ll then have the option to send any of these Facebook friends a Real ID friend request in-game. (Keep in mind that for someone to appear on the list, their Battle.net account email address must match their Facebook email address. In addition, you&#8217;ll see the names of any Facebook friends who have registered Battle.net accounts, regardless of whether they have Blizzard games attached to their account or just, for example, created the Battle.net account to make a purchase on the online Blizzard Store.)<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s important to note that Blizzard Entertainment does not share any personal information with Facebook as part of this process. Keep in mind that as with other Real ID features such as the &#8220;friends of friends&#8221; list, our goal with the friend finder feature is to create convenient options to help players easily find people they know in real life on Battle.net without having to remember email addresses or account names. We hope players will find the feature easy to use and convenient.<br />
<br />
Q: How can I prevent World of Warcraft add-ons from accessing Real ID first and last names without my knowledge?<br />
A: As always, we recommend that you get your UI add-ons through reliable sources. It&#8217;s important to note that without installing a UI add-on specifically designed to retrieve that information, there&#8217;s no risk of it being accessed. On our end, we&#8217;re looking into the issue and are at work on some changes that we can make to help protect against these types of add-ons. We&#8217;ll provide further details as soon as we have more information to share.<br />
<br />
Q: Are you secretly trying to build a social gaming platform with the new Battle.net?<br />
A: It&#8217;s no secret -- as we&#8217;ve discussed openly since we first started sharing our plans about the new Battle.net, one of our goals is for it to serve as a social gaming service for Blizzard gamers. This was a deliberate and open design decision, driven 100% by the desire to create an even better online experience for our players by giving them powerful tools to compete with and stay connected to their real-life friends and family.<br />
<br />
Q: If my account was compromised, what information about my Real ID friends would a hacker have access to?<br />
A: We take account security very seriously, and we offer a number of ways to help players keep their account secure, including the Battle.net Authenticator and the free Battle.net Mobile Authenticator app, available for a wide range of mobile devices. Aside from your friends&#8217; first and last names, no other personal information is shared through the in-game Real ID system.<br />
<br />
Q: What&#8217;s a StarCraft II &quot;character code&quot;?<br />
A: When you first log in to StarCraft II, you&#8217;re prompted to choose a single character name. This is the only name you&#8217;ll use on Battle.net, and it&#8217;s tied to your StarCraft II license. In order to allow players to select any name they wish regardless of whether another player is already using the same name, we then generate and assign a three-digit character code that uniquely identifies the player. When posting on the forums of the new StarCraft II community site, players will be posting using their StarCraft II character name and character code.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the new StarCraft II forum posting name format (character name + character code) carry over into the forum communities of other Blizzard games?<br />
A: Following our recent decision to no longer use real first and last names on Blizzard forums, we&#8217;re still evaluating how we&#8217;ll move forward with our other forums. Our ultimate goal is still to promote constructive conversations and improve the overall forum experience for our players, and we think increasing accountability is an important part of achieving that. StarCraft II already uses a character name and character code combo in-game, which serves as a unique player identifier and fits well with our goal for the forums. World of Warcraft handles player identification differently, so we still need to determine whether adding a character code system like in StarCraft II is the best solution. Ultimately, we want to come up with a system that makes sense for each community and fits our long-term vision for the forums.<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to change the in-game Real ID system so that players will have the option to display an assigned user name instead of their real names?<br />
A: The Real ID system is designed to help real-life friends and family who decide to use it keep in touch with each other across Blizzard games, and our goal in using real names is to ensure that players will be able to maintain long-term, meaningful relationships on the service for years to come. One way it helps make that happen is by eliminating the need to remember who, for example, &quot;Thrall123&quot; really is when you see him or her pop up on your friends list again after months -- or years -- of being offline. Ultimately, we think this is the best way to ensure players who use Real ID are able stay connected with the people they enjoy playing with most in the long-term, and we don&#8217;t currently have any plans to change the system so it can be used with character names or alternate handles instead. That said, Battle.net is a living, breathing service that we will continue to evolve over time as we evaluate how players are using it and identify new ways to improve the experience.<br />

Q: What plans are there to improve moderation since the use of real names on the forums has been changed?<br />
A: Our new community sites&#8217; forums, beginning with the StarCraft II site, will have an improved moderation system as well as a post-rating system which will help our players promote the conversations they find the most constructive, as well as help forum moderators identify quality discussions. This, coupled with the unique StarCraft II character name and code, will help us to create a more positive atmosphere based on community interaction and accountability.</div></div><hr />

Like if they wanted to reduce cookie cutter builds why would they make it so u have no choices and everyone gets the same thing in the tree pretty much because theres barely any points that u can skip to move up the next tier?<br />
<br />
Or why hunter focus is 3 focus a second when rogues is 10 and the first idea was 6 focus a second and it got changed without any indication of it getting lowered or why it got lowered to the fact most hunters in beta says spamming focus it takes 20 seconds to go from 0 focus back to 100 and its almost unplayable as a class now.<br />
<br />
feels like this is going to be fail with barely info that needs to be answered, actually answered =/</div></div><hr />

A: The Real ID system is designed to help real-life friends and family who decide to use it keep in touch with each other across Blizzard games, and our goal in using real names is to ensure that players will be able to maintain long-term, meaningful relationships on the service for years to come. One way it helps make that happen is by eliminating the need to remember who, for example, &quot;Thrall123&quot; really is when you see him or her pop up on your friends list again after months -- or years -- of being offline. Ultimately, we think this is the best way to ensure players who use Real ID are able stay connected with the people they enjoy playing with most in the long-term, and we don’t currently have any plans to change the system so it can be used with character names or alternate handles instead. That said, Battle.net is a living, breathing service that we will continue to evolve over time as we evaluate how players are using it and identify new ways to improve the experience.<br />
Call me archaic, but isn't the same goal met by allowing you to add a note to the person's information? Kinda like how you can with the friend list in WoW right now? I've yet to see Blizzard, or anyone else for that matter, give an answer to justify the use of real names that using a nickname wouldn't do just as well for (and in most cases better). I still don't understand why they'd take a system of social interaction and move backwards with the philosophy instead of forward. I can't even see a monetary benefit from it.<br />
<br />
Q: I don't care about Real ID, new talent points, or ponies, but I must have a double rainbow in a city so all can bask in its glory!<br />
A. Due to company policy, I’m afraid we must reserve all rainbows for our friends working on Diablo III.<br />
<br />
Q: Let's talk fashion. Any chance we could get a tophat AND monocle to display at the same time?<br />
A. Why, yes. Indubitably. Tut-tut, my good chap and cheerio! <br />
Really?! That's two questions of wasted time that could've been put toward answering something that mattered. I'm all for having fun and joking around, but with a Q&amp;A that's on a strict limited time, that's not the place to answer retarded and time-wasting questions. Leave that crap for the forums.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2010-07-17, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">a. All of the paladin specializations will make use of a new resource called holy power. Holy power accumulates from using crusader strike, holy shock, and some other talents. Holy power can be consumed to augment a variety of abilities, including:<br />
<br />
* an instant mana-free heal: Word of glory<br />
* a buff to increase holy damage done: Inquisition<br />
* a massive physical melee attack for retribution paladins: Templar&#8217;s verdict<br />
* holy shield&#8217;s duration is now extended by holy power<br />
* divine storm&#8217;s damage is now increased by holy power<br />
<br />
<br />
we also introduced several new heals for holy paladins including healing hands (an aoe heal-over-time that is applied to all players standing near the paladin), light of dawn (a cone heal with a 30-yard range), as well as a new heal called divine light, which is similar to a priest's greater heal, and the new instant heal mentioned above, word of glory.<br />

A. No, and you can blame the druids. We want a tanking specialization in Bear Form to feel different from a DPS specialization in Cat Form, otherwise it doesn&#8217;t feel fair to other classes when the Feral druid can do everything with the same talent specialization. We try to put crit immunity in talents you would normally take.<br />
<br />
Now that was a stupid reason for it not being implemented.<br />
Why not make the crit immunity bear form only? That would solve it.<br />
And to ensure bear is not used effectively in cat specialization, the bear talents must be the main source of damage for bear.</div></div><hr />

At first I agreed with this. But after thinking about it and talking with a friend about it, I'm not sure there's as much money to be made there as most imply. Selling customer's information is something that the general public, not just gamers, are starting to take issue with. But that's an entirely different discussion. :)</div></div><hr />

More interesting, not necessarily more powerful.<br />

As for Holy Power itself, I am quite intrigued. While it probably won't be as game-changing as the new Soul shard system or Hunters switching from mana to focus, I am looking forward to experimenting with the new resource system.</div></div><hr />

A. The talent specializations that rely heavily on pets (Beast Mastery and Demonology, for example) have a Mastery that makes Mastery rating also increase pet damage. Other specializations that have pets, but whose pets do not benefit from Mastery, will have their Masteries balanced accordingly, taking into account that pets will not benefit from them. <br />
Does this mean that Marksman/Survival hunters and Destruction/Affliction warlocks will scale REALLY well with mastery rating?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would not solve the problem they are seeing, which is if they built the crit immunity into bear form, then a druid could spec for pure cat-form dps, then shift into bear form and would still be likely to be an effective tank. As long as it gets tacked onto other useful tank-only talents, it really shouldn't matter to any of the tanking classes where they get it from, so long as they can get it.</div></div><hr />

The idea is that they don't want a feral kitty being able to change into bear form and pick up a raid boss if it goes down. The goal is for healers to keep tanks alive, not ensure that every raid has a couple kitty druids who can do a ton of dps, then go bear form and pick up the boss if the MT goes down. You need to spec for DPS or spec for Tanking.<br />

<br />
Holy Power seems more comparable to combo points than the new soul shard mechanic, the only thing it has in common with the latter is the number three. <br />
Like Combo Points, you get them from using abilities and (from the current preview) they just ramp up the power of abilities. Soul shards are a resource that changes the way a spell works. That's not really similar at all.<br />

There's also only going to be 3 DK runes now, does that threaten your uniqueness as well?</div></div><hr />

The other question wasn't much better. It was pretty much &quot;Will frost be the pvp spec still?&quot; They're not gonna say yes.<br />

If fire and frost specs lose the ability to trigger arcane missiles, what's the point of having them as a proc? I was hoping frost would use them, but I guess not. Are the two extra arcane missiles additional to the five we have now? Do arcane or frost mages get molten armor too?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sulfuric</div><div class="date">2010-07-17, 07:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Q: What about some class specific quests for Cataclysm? I enjoyed them in the early levels of WoW!<br />
A: It’s very expensive to create class-specific raids given the literally thousands of new quests we are already adding for Cataclysm; however, we are going to have class-specific dungeon quests for everyone at levels 20 and 50. These won’t be as involved as, say, the old Benediction quest line, but they will give you a way to get some blue loot that isn’t otherwise available.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The man asks him about class specific quests, and he says class specific raids are expensive? Then goes to say there are low level class specific quests in dungeons which lack the complexity of the ones people are asking for? What a dodge, and how expensive could a quest be? Actually expensive or just more expensive than not making it at all? Nice to know cost is an issue when making the most lucrative PC game in the history of mmorpg's.</div></div><hr />

Like if they wanted to reduce cookie cutter builds why would they make it so u have no choices and everyone gets the same thing in the tree pretty much because theres barely any points that u can skip to move up the next tier?<br />
<br />
Or why hunter focus is 3 focus a second when rogues is 10 and the first idea was 6 focus a second and it got changed without any indication of it getting lowered or why it got lowered to the fact most hunters in beta says spamming focus it takes 20 seconds to go from 0 focus back to 100 and its almost unplayable as a class now.<br />
<br />
feels like this is going to be fail with barely info that needs to be answered, actually answered =/<br />
<br />
Holy crap... please try to make more readable sentences. Your sentence about focus is very long and very annoying to read. Also remember it's all still beta and they're working on it. If any of the classes is unplayable right now, it will surely be fixed when Cataclysm comes out.<br />
<br />
Also you say that a lot of these questions are stupid, but I beg to differ. Perhaps you only looked at one or two classes, but having read them all I must say there are some very interesting questions and answers. Especially about Paladins, that's stuff we haven't heard much about before.</div></div><hr />

That said, we’re trying to move away from having purely PvP or purely PvE talents as much as possible, which will make the pure PvP specializations less painful to play in PvE and vice versa.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A Protection warrior who tanks a lot of 5-player dungeons might want talents that help with AoE pulls, while one that is a raid off-tank might want, say, Safeguard and Vigilance instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
How can it's ok if the spec is the same in pvp and pve, but you have to choose some talents depending on raid vs 5 men for a same roll? in both cases, you'll need to respec for maximum efficiency.</div></div><hr />

Possibly because those two questions are far more ignorant than what's already being asked (with a couple of exceptions...).<br />
<br />
I can answer the first question just based on common sense alone. In fact, I'll answer it in two separate ways both leading to the same end result.<br />
<br />
A1: Because it's the FIRST IMPLEMENTATION and the not the FINAL one.<br />
A2: Because it's NOT FINISHED.<br />
<br />
Why would you think a massive overhaul to an existing system like this would be sparkly and shiny with its FIRST IMPLEMENTATION? To be perfectly honest, I'm surprised it's as clear and understandable as it is considering how badly they wanted the testers to get their hands on it for feedback. And before anyone goes on some random tangent, I'm not saying &quot;they don't want feedback&quot;. Quite the contrary, they do. But that question is certainly not feedback considering they stated from the get go that this is only a first pass.<br />
<br />
As for the whole cookie cutter thing; I really wish people would get off that shtick. There have been cookie cutter builds from the start. Yes, there have always been variations for SOME of the specs, but considering the current state of the talent trees, you cannot, with any authority, make the claim that they are not trying to reduce the cookie cutter specs. There's going to be variation choices with the final talent trees but instead of the having 5-10 points to wonder what to do with, you'll have maybe 3-6. The choices will be easier and more substantial and, dare I say it, more meaningful.<br />
<br />
<br />

PvP and PvE are not the same. While 5mans and raids are on different scales of difficulty, they are both PvE. Add to that, an OT is going to have a different spec than the MT most of the time anyway. An OT will, most of the time, be soaking raid damage or juggling multiple adds at once. Either one of those situations can easily require different abilities to be used and thus a different spec even while comparing raid vs raid.</div></div><hr />

Why not make the crit immunity bear form only? That would solve it.<br />
And to ensure bear is not used effectively in cat specialization, the bear talents must be the main source of damage for bear.<br />
<br />
The point is not crit immunity in cat form, the problem is that with the same spec, a dps feral druid can simply change gear and go bear to tank, without having to change their talents.</div></div><hr />

In any respectable guild, you change your tank's duties every raid not to be fucked when your &quot;MT&quot; can't make the raid. You take a spec to tank, OT or MT should not come into the equation for the spec. besides, the tank is more likely to do a 5men and a raid in the same day, than pvp/arena and a raid, for example. it's stupid to require 2 specs, or just different talents for your daily hc and a raid at night, just to have the feeling to be at 100% of your class.</div></div><hr />

By 'expensive' I believe he means in terms of time. They have a lot of quests to work on and it's just not as worthwhile to take the time and energy to create a quest that only a limited proportion of the player base will even have access to. The exception to this are quests where every class has a variant, such as they &quot;go find your trainer&quot; quests in the starting zones.<br />
<br />
Also, it's wanted but not needed. The needed quests are the parts of quest chains that every player will be able to progress through.</div></div><hr />

I hear you, but it kind of feels like you're only desperately defending your heroes... I mean come on? What game company wants its customers to play the same shit over again, without implementing some new stuff here and there? Business men wants that, not creative developers. If they reduced the endless amount of raids and 5m dungeons that will be consumed and thrown away after 1 month anyway, they might have had some time to spare for real changes, such as class specific quests or housing. <br />
<br />
&quot;We can't do housing with NPCs because people would stop being in the citadel&quot;, eh, okay. First of all, don't you WANT people out of the citadel to reduce lags and crashes? Second, who said a house need NPCs etc? A house can easily be instanced on the same spot for many people, allowing 1 person have one house for a large cost.

<br />
I wouldn't exactly call Blizzard my heroes. For example: here's the feedback I left for them on the new talent trees:<br />
<br />
<br />
If a talent does any of the following then it is interesting.<br />
* Gives spell, or a condition (such as an auto attack) an additional effect<br />
<br />
Examples include:<br />
* Warrios: Deep Wounds, Unbridled Wrath, Shield Specialization<br />
* Mages: Arcane Repulsion, Master of Elements, Frostbite<br />
* Priests: Evangelism, Inspiration, Improved Mind Blast<br />
* Rogues: Ruthlessness, Improved Recuperate, Relentless Strikes<br />
* Druids: Improved Eclipse, Infected Wounds, Furor<br />
* Hunters: Frenzy, Go for the Throat, Improved Serpent Sting<br />
* Warlocks: Improved Drain Soul,Improved Health Funnel, Improved Soul Fire<br />
* Paladins: Judgements of the Pure, Sanctuary, Eye for an Eye<br />
* Shamans: Elemental Focus, Flurry, Improved Water Shield<br />
* Death Knight: Blade Barrier, Runic Empowerment, Resilient Infection<br />
<br />
Some of these are new, some aren't, but all of them give your spell something that other specs of the same character, who did not choose those talent points, cannot do. That's what is most important about the talent trees to a lot of new players: &quot;how can I use this to make my character different to others?&quot;.<br />
<br />
If the talent does any of the following, and only the following, then it is not interesting and should be removed.<br />
* Increases a stat<br />
* Increases a stat by another stat<br />
* Increases the duration of an effect that the spell already does<br />
* Increases the range of a spell, or school of spells<br />
* Increases the damage of a spell, or school of spells<br />
* Increases the critical strike chance of a spell, or school of spells<br />
* Increases the number of times that a spell does something that it already does<br />
* Reduce the cooldown of a spell, or school of spells<br />
* Reduces the cost of a spell, or school of spells<br />
* Reduces damage taken<br />
<br />
In each of these cases it would be better to find a middle ground between the current stats of the spell and the stats with these additional talent points spend, then use that as the new base level of the spell. These are the kind of things that many people were hoping you would remove, so why were they left in? There is nothing even remotely interesting about &quot;Reduces the cost of your totems by 30%&quot; or &quot;Increases the range of your Icy Touch, Chains of Ice and Howling Blast by 10 yards&quot; and especially not &quot;Increases your shadow spell damage by 10%&quot;.<br />
<br />
All the current beta talent trees have far too many boring talents in them that would be much better if they were covered by Masteries, additional bonuses to stats based on class or just having more of a stat on gear (in the case of hit). There's a lot of promise in the talent trees, far more than in live, but still a very long way to go. <br />
<br />
Not exactly the glowing praise they were hoping for I think you'll agree.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean come on? What game company wants its customers to play the same shit over again, without implementing some new stuff here and there? Business men wants that, not creative developers. <br />
As someone who's worked in the games industry I can tell you that it's all about compromise. The designers may want to implement lots of cool features but they have to be realistic and take into account things like manpower, time for testing, how likely it is for massive bugs to be found and how easily it could break something else, which leads to even more testing time.<br />
<br />
The company wants to make money for the minimum amount of investment, whether it's time, money or effort. Everything else is secondary, regardless of what anyone who is part of the company may like to think.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they reduced the endless amount of raids and 5m dungeons that will be consumed and thrown away after 1 month anyway, they might have had some time to spare for real changes, such as class specific quests or housing.<br />
Most people will take at least a week or two for a new raid; longer if they want to go for heroic difficulty fights. Quests are done within hours. Which makes more sense based purely on how quickly it'll be consumed by the player?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;We can't do housing with NPCs because people would stop being in the citadel&quot;, eh, okay. First of all, don't you WANT people out of the citadel to reduce lags and crashes? Second, who said a house need NPCs etc? A house can easily be instanced on the same spot for many people, allowing 1 person have one house for a large cost. As the instance is so small, it won't put pressure on the instance servers.<br />
1. Lag and crashes are better than ghost towns. Think of how much work was put into Silvermoon and Exodar. It also makes everyone on the server become a community rather than being tightly concentrated within their guilds; that's what Guild Chat is for.<br />
2. NPCs will be expected.<br />
<br />
<br />
They simply don't want innovation.<br />
They need to compromise. This is the nature of any games company.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Imagine if they removed 500 normal quests, and instead took that time to make 1 long and epic class specific quest for each class, wouldn't that bring LOTS more joy to every player than the normal &quot;Collect this and get a green iten&quot; quests we all sleep through?<br />
Imagine how quickly everyone would finish it then complain that they wanted more quests, class-specific or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd rather have 500 epic quests...<br />
<br />
Edit: From the GUILD housing Question.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW why do you want a house?<br />
Just imagine the amount of resources that each house/character would need.<br />
<br />
<br />
500 epic quests? Do you honestly believe all the 3000-something quests will be epic? I would say around 500 TOPS will be cool or even remotely cool. The rest will be either updated old quests that are still pretty much the same, or new quests that are entirely pointless, only there to help you level up. Like I said, the general quest of WoW today is &quot;Hello stranger, I'm here to do a mission which I am specialized for, but now that a complete stranger with seemingly no talent for this came along, I might as well let you do it. So go kill 12 of this mob and bring me their toenails, and I will reward you handsomely with this green quality item that for no particular reason is twice as good as a legendary weapon dropped by the baddest and meanest thug in the world.&quot; Not only are they pointless, but players KNOW they're pointless, and often skip the texts. A lot of time invested in those quests could easily go to making proper quests that are funny and last for a long time.<br />
<br />
And I personally don't want a house in WoW as there is far too little athmosphere and depth to make a house worth while in my opinion, but there are others who wants one.<br />
What kind of recources? The easiest solution would be to design a batch of houses (say 5-10) that a player chooses between once he or she has purchased an instance slot for it. Then he or she can enter it as they will. Hell, the opening to the instance can even be the same for 500 individual houses, using instance IDs.<br />
<br />
What I'm getting at is there are so many options and possibilities to make even an old game like WoW tons better, but there simply isn't any will to do it from the developer's part, OR there is will, but no funding by the greedy owners. Thus, even if WoW has a few good sides, it is now not only an old game, but it is a never changing and BORING game, which will spell it's own doom within a couple of years.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">loftus</div><div class="date">2010-07-17, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this Q &amp; A really worries me.<br />
<br />
Not only am i against the 'stick to one tree completely until level 70 idea' but i hadnt even thought about the healing specs. How many people will pick holy or discipline, when picking shadow at level 10 makes levelling solo viable?<br />
<br />
I can see a real lack of healers in dungeons until level 70, as if that wasnt a problem already... followed by a large amount of crap healers from 71-85.<br />
<br />
Im trying to keep faith in blizz here but it's really difficult. I could handle the idea of having less talent points (even though it sucks) but then forcing us completely into trees and having no real choice in those trees is just depressing.<br />
<br />
when there are 6-7 points in a tier, and you need 5 to progress, while having to stay in the tier... who the hell is it not going to be cookie-cutter? blizz say they are doing this to remove cookie-cutter builds, but then reduce the amount of options people have so 'nobody can be wrong' and increase the chances of cloned builds by default.<br />
<br />
gah blizzard, get it together!<br />
<br />
EDIT: surely, just having a little think about it, the best thing to do in order to give people more choice and reduce the number of cookie cutter builds would be to include LOADS of talents, while giving us the same number of choices. That way it wouldnt be do i choose dps &gt; utility, which is always a one-sided battle, it would end up dps vs. dps talent and utility vs utility talent seperately, making peoples playstyles more important rather than 'what is best statistically'.</div></div><hr />

Holy Power is... Very interesting, to say the least. I can't wait to see what they do with it. I'm also excited that it seems Paladins are getting about 4 new heals. AoE HoT, Cone Heal, Big Heal, and Instant Weak Heal. Seems good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Not exactly the glowing praise they were hoping for I think you'll agree.<br />
<br />
<br />
As someone who's worked in the games industry I can tell you that it's all about compromise. The designers may want to implement lots of cool features but they have to be realistic and take into account things like manpower, time for testing, how likely it is for massive bugs to be found and how easily it could break something else, which leads to even more testing time.<br />
<br />
The company wants to make money for the minimum amount of investment, whether it's time, money or effort. Everything else is secondary, regardless of what anyone who is part of the company may like to think.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most people will take at least a week or two for a new raid; longer if they want to go for heroic difficulty fights. Quests are done within hours. Which makes more sense based purely on how quickly it'll be consumed by the player?<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Lag and crashes are better than ghost towns. Think of how much work was put into Silvermoon and Exodar. It also makes everyone on the server become a community rather than being tightly concentrated within their guilds; that's what Guild Chat is for.<br />
2. NPCs will be expected.<br />
<br />
<br />
They need to compromise. This is the nature of any games company.<br />
<br />
<br />
Imagine how quickly everyone would finish it then complain that they wanted more quests, class-specific or not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course the company wants maximum reward for minimum effort, that's a no-brainer.<br />
What I'm trying to say is, WoW, old as it may be, has tons of potential to be better, but they're simply not making an effort. They think their fans are retards who are happy with the same content over and over again. It's working for the extreme fanbois who's never played a different game in their entire lives, but it's boring the hell out of most people. <br />
<br />
I know I can simply leave WoW if I'm not happy, but I still enjoy the debate.<br />
<br />
Why would housing mean ghost towns? Give me one reason, bearing in mind there will still be things to do in the citadel such as auction houses, finding raids and pvp, guilds, etc. <br />
<br />
Besides, who's to say that's a bad thing, if they indeed did become ghost towns? I can't think of a single town in WoW that actually brings me pleasure and enjoyment. Some of them have a sort of cosy feel to them, but they are mostly poorly designed, boring to log on at, makes players lazy, and cause lag. Why not just stop designing stupid citadels instead? Which, by the way, they are doing in Cata, so there's one problem solved regarding housing.<br />
<br />
You say people will get bored of the epic class quests as well. Well certainly, that happens to most features in WoW, but during that time as they enjoyed it, they've felt slightly more unique than their fellow classes, they've had an epic and rewarding experience, and all at the cost of very little development time compared to say, instances.<br />
<br />
All dev's need to compromise, but from what I've seen in WoW the past few years - they've done nothing BUT compromise. Every new cool feature is removed before implementation or even before design, and what we--the customers--are left with is the same garbage over, and over, and over again.<br />
<br />
In what way did BC differ from vanilla in end game, apart from a few mechanics changed? Same question for WotLK from BC? And soon from WotLK to Cata? I'm telling you, it's like going to work, only the curtains are changed once in a while.<br />

Ghost towns = wasted time. They might as well not exist.<br />
More ghost towns = far less likely to create any more towns in the future.<br />

It always boils down to a raid full of players trying to work out how to win an encounter. What exactly were you expecting? That's all end-game content is every going to be in World of Warcraft and it's the reason I enjoy it. Gearing up your character, researching each fight, trying to work out how to improve on the tactics you've seen / read about, figuring out how to improve your personal performance, comparing the drops to see if it's an upgrade for me and what I'd be sacrificing in terms of stats, etc, etc. That is PvE Endgame.</div></div><hr />

Are you joking me? Do you even know how big companies work these day? They have different divisions of employees. Based on A) What game you work on, and B) what part of a game you work on. The standard is if your people can't get the job done, you find new people and either replace the old ones, or let the new ones take some burden of their shoulders. Blaming how poor a game's design is on the number of employees is just stupid. <br />
And tbh I don't see where the &quot;caring&quot; enters the philosophy of a WoW dev. They might care, but can't act out on it due to producers, or they don't care, and it shows through their work. <br />
<br />
It's obvious WoW is the dying cash cow kept alive to fund the projects they DO care about: SC2, D3 and the new secret next-gen MMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of people are happy with the same content over and over again, but I agree with you on the second part.<br />
<br />
Well then I'm very happy for them; they've found the perfect game to match their needs.<br />
<br />
<br />
The vast majority of people in towns like dalaran, stormwind and orgrimmar are just sitting around. They aren't doing any of the things you mentioned.<br />
<br />
Precisely - they're just sitting around. You log out in Dalaran, you log on in Dalaran. And then what? You never leave, unless someone in trade chat says &quot;LFM ICC25HM&quot; or &quot;WG is up&quot;, because LFG tools teleport you anywhere you want, and there's no reason for anyone to go outside of the stinky towns anymore as there's no support for having fun in any other place. Is it better to have a ghost WORLD rather than ghost towns? I guess one could go enjoy the really old zones once in a while, but this got boring after about the 20th time I did so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghost towns = wasted time. They might as well not exist.<br />
More ghost towns = far less likely to create any more towns in the future.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying they should make ghost towns. I'm saying towns become ghost towns because of their design. They force people into the same spot, whether they want to or not. If they stopped making huge towns now (which they are) the problems are solved. It has nothing to do with features such as housing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I never said that they would get bored. I said that they would be finished extremely quickly then people would go back to being bored.<br />
<br />
How is this relevant? If a quest is good - it's good. If you can design 50 of these epic quests (I mean really long) during the time you made one dungeon, it would be a win. Who here enjoys Halls of Stone these days? Every time you leveled up, you would love an epic class quest, imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's because you're focusing on what you've seen get thrown away rather than what's been added to the game.<br />
<br />
So tell me, what's added? Apart from purely mechanical things to improve server load and such, like 10/25m, etc.<br />
I've seen phasing, that's about it. Hardmodes is a crappy solution, so don't bring that up.<br />
<br />

And that's not a good thing. By the way, don't you tell me the average raider figures out how to solve a boss by putting their keen minds together, while having lots of fun.

No, and I'm not kidding you either. I'm not blaming the poor design of the game on the number of employees; I'm blaming the lack of new, interesting features that you so desperately want on the number of employees. <br />
<br />
And tbh I don't see where the &quot;caring&quot; enters the philosophy of a WoW dev. They might care, but can't act out on it due to producers, or they don't care, and it shows through their work. <br />
From my experience it's almost always due to the first option if a feature gets cut.<br />
<br />
<br />
Precisely - they're just sitting around. You log out in Dalaran, you log on in Dalaran. And then what? You never leave, unless someone in trade chat says &quot;LFM ICC25HM&quot; or &quot;WG is up&quot;, because LFG tools teleport you anywhere you want, and there's no reason for anyone to go outside of the stinky towns anymore as there's no support for having fun in any other place. Is it better to have a ghost WORLD rather than ghost towns? I guess one could go enjoy the really old zones once in a while, but this got boring after about the 20th time I did so.<br />
It's never going to be a ghost world because people will always be grinding experience (levelling), grinding mats (farming), grinding rep, etc. Just because there's nothing you want to do doesn't mean there is nothing out there to do. Even the people who have earned every available achievement still need to get prepared for whenever the next patch comes out.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not saying they should make ghost towns. I'm saying towns become ghost towns because of their design. They force people into the same spot, whether they want to or not. If they stopped making huge towns now (which they are) the problems are solved. It has nothing to do with features such as housing.<br />

No, that would be a fail. Each person would do all those quest chains once while the dungeon can be visited again, and again, and again... it doesn't matter how often it is actually visited, only the number of times it can be theoretically visited. Heroic dungeons mean that it will continue to be visited for the entire expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
So tell me, what's added? Apart from purely mechanical things to improve server load and such, like 10/25m, etc.<br />

Hmm...<br />
Dungeon finder and random battleground finder?<br />
Wintergrasp? Despite all the redesign that's gone through<br />
Vehicles?<br />
Dual spec?<br />
Achievements?<br />
<br />

The average raider may not, but that's their choice. Personally the guild's I've been in have used encounter videos only as a rough guide (&quot;The boss is here, we are here, if you get a big bomb you run over here...&quot;).<br />
<br />

That'd probably be a nerf, as HoJ's duration is about as long as stuns get. If it did happen, hopefully they'd lower the cooldown a bit to balance it.<br />

I'd also like the ask the people who claim that ret paladins are already OP, what game are you playing? Ret paladins are nearly the worst class-spec you'd want in arena right now, stop living in 3.0.</div></div><hr />

I'm not blaming the poor design of the game on the number of employees; I'm blaming the lack of new, interesting features that you so desperately want on the number of employees. <br />
<br />
From my experience it's almost always due to the first option if a feature gets cut.<br />
<br />
<br />
You were a minute ago. If you have 50 employees that are all pro within their field, somewhere someone should be able to think of a few good, new, innovative and maybe slightly original ideas. In fact, a lot of the designers should be able to, if not all. Now, of all these ideas being pitched perhaps even daily, a few SHOULD make it into the game, and at expansions, MANY should make it into the game. How many do we see yearly? 0.75, of which most are crap?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's never going to be a ghost world because people will always be grinding experience (levelling), grinding mats (farming), grinding rep, etc. Just because there's nothing you want to do doesn't mean there is nothing out there to do. Even the people who have earned every available achievement still need to get prepared for whenever the next patch comes out.<br />
<br />
Well, first of all; people leveling up a character or doing some grind doesn't imply the world is alive. It only implies someone wants another char at the end game to chill around Dalaran and do some raids/pvp. We all know grinding in WoW is terrible, and the only reason you do it is either because a new faction has just been installed, making it profitable to grind for them, or because you are terribly bored, but can't figure out what to do besides WoW at the time being, so you start pointless little mini projects like hoarding gold for next expansion or a mount, getting exalted with every faction for an achiv, or collecting mini-pets you will never use for another stupid achiv. <br />
<br />
Again, doing these things in WoW isn't enjoyment, it's something you do because the game offers so little to do, you see little option. I know I'm generalising here, but I do so with good cause and source.<br />
A simple proof of my claim is the fact that everyone is always desperate for a new content patch or expansion, and browse the web like crazy daily for a year after an exp was announced (like MMO-Champ), simply because they are so bored. A proper game with a really rich game world and things to do wouldn't let you go bored after two years without major updates. WoW bores people within a couple of months after an expansion, how do you explain that?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Silvermoon became a ghost town because it wasn't Orgrimmar.<br />
Exodar became a ghost town because it wasn't Stormwind.<br />
<br />
And Orgrimmar/Stormwind became what they are because of an easily attainable AH, bank, and so forth. People know the cities (including IF) so well, and the important stuff are centered in one area of the city, making it easier for people to gather there. I doubt many people actually ENJOY being in any of those cities, as it doesn't even feel as if you're in a living city.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, that would be a fail. Each person would do all those quest chains once while the dungeon can be visited again, and again, and again... it doesn't matter how often it is actually visited, only the number of times it can be theoretically visited. Heroic dungeons mean that it will continue to be visited for the entire expansion.<br />
<br />
The point isn't how many times you CAN do it, the point is how much you enjoy it. The ONLY reason people keep visiting HC dungeons is because they A) level an alt and need some starter gear, or B) farm badges or rep. I know personally, and all of my friends with me, get bored as hell inside most HC dungeons these days. They were okay for a month or two, but not now... atm they're a waste of development time, if you compare them to what could be done instead. It doesn't matter if an epic quest gets boring by the third time you do it. First of all it will still be a different experience for any class you do it with, so it will last for at least every alt you make, and most of all, it's the fact that something NEW enters the came now and then that matters.<br />
<br />
The basic formula for WoW content is pretty clear: Release some half-assed new bit of lore, along with a few dungeons, some raid dungeons, and perhaps some new areas ans factions. It's ALWAYS the same thing. The only thing that change are the names of things, and the increased stat points on items - NOTHING ELSE. If you consider this good game design, I can see why you no longer work in the industry.<br />
<br />
I'm an aspiring game writer myself (going to Univ in 2 months), and already my head is BURSTING with a million new ideas for games such as WoW, and ways to implement them. If someone who IS a game designer can't do this, then I'm speechless. Money and time are valid factors, yes, but they aren't the only factors, and they don't govern everything.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm...<br />
Dungeon finder and random battleground finder?<br />
Wintergrasp? Despite all the redesign that's gone through<br />
Vehicles?<br />
Dual spec?<br />
Achievements?<br />
<br />
<br />
How are these good implementations to help create a richer world? Vehicles and Dual spec might earn you a point there (even though I personally dislike them both), but the rest are only UI and technical stuff that doesn't mean anything to the world itself. They don't enhance your RPG experience - they make your game a little easier and quicker.<br />
<br />
<br />
The average raider may not, but that's their choice. Personally the guild's I've been in have used encounter videos only as a rough guide (&quot;The boss is here, we are here, if you get a big bomb you run over here...&quot;).<br />
<br />
But isn't the average gamer what atually counts? Sure, every type of gamer should get his or her fair share of love, but surely the masses are what defines the general experience. How is your usage of videos different from anyone elses? You just said that you learn tactics from videos, thus you don't embark on some epic journey of great peril and adventure...<br />
<br />
<br />
I like to improve my character and my ability to play my character in any way I can. I also enjoy the raid environment of achieving something enjoyable with my friends.<br />
<br />
Hi. My name is TobiasX and I'm a Raider.<br />
<br />
What's your game?<br />
<br />
I like certain aspects of raiding too (like 10% of it, and mostly in the past), but you seem to have a pretty strong misconception of what raiding is. The real deal with raiding is: You enter a new raid, read guides, learn bosses, get them on farm, improve your items slightly by a few stat points through vast periods of time, until the bosses are so worn down you can almost see through them. You get hungry for new &quot;content&quot;, the next raid is released, repeat. There's never anything different about this, ever.<br />
<br />
My game used to be WoW, but after growing out of my pointless teens, discovering more games produced today, and learning something of the industry (including embarking on my own little designer-to-be adventure), my mind is wide awake, and I now see WoW for what it really is: Utter crap, and a thorn in the side of any decent game dev with his honour intact.</div></div><hr />

Q. With each expansion boss mechanics become more and more complex. Don't you think that bosses will be overcomplicated soon?<br />
A. We have a lot of players who have been killing bosses for six years now. We think we need to keep it fresh for them. Having normal vs. Hard modes is our way of making sure the complexity doesn’t make those fights inaccessible for some players.<br />
<br />
<br />
LMAO, really? Bosses are too complex? What boss isn't a recycled mechanic with a small wrinkle? Outside of Ulduar Hardmodes, almost everything was a variation of a pre-existing boss mechanic that was already in the game. Anyone that believes that they are too complex hasn't played from the beginning, so everything is fresh to them and the reason why Premo and Vodka smack bosses down so easily. At least there isn't a 10 phase fight yet that explores the worst mechanics in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sounds to me they are gonna turn paladins into Warrior priest (WAR). Giving the class a SECOND limit (not only mana but also Holy Power) makes the class even more limited than ever before. WHile other healing classes will push a group heal button requering mana - holy palas need to have mana; have holy power, position themselfs, and then hit the button. <br />
<br />
I have played few classes through the years with cone abilites. They always turn into a disaster cause ping is diffrent for one person than another and what looks to be in front for some - actually is behind from the server side. So... as a healing mecanic - this will not work at all.<br />
<br />
But they are at least admitting that Paladin needs more group healing abilites. The problem ofc - like usually with Blizzard. They are experimenting with it big time and not even testing it properly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paladin changes seems interesting and will be fun to try it out when it's deployed on beta. I love how everyone says paladins will be OP before it's even been tested by players. <br />
Great thing about playing a paladin is that it's a new class every expansion.<br />
<br />
The reduced HS cast time when Devine Shield is active glyph made me smile to. But I think it's something they're considering since Bubble Heart is something close to the core of the paladin class and with the reduced duration of Devine Shield it's not impossible this will be a minor glyph since it's not game changing and will keep Bubble Heart alive.</div></div><hr />

A. No, and you can blame the druids. We want a tanking specialization in Bear Form to feel different from a DPS specialization in Cat Form, otherwise it doesn&#8217;t feel fair to other classes when the Feral druid can do everything with the same talent specialization. We try to put crit immunity in talents you would normally take.<br />
<br />
Glad they answered my question, even if I dont much like the answer. My concern in spending talents to become crit immune is that each tank has to spend a different amount of points on it. <br />
<br />
What would make me VERY happy, is if they attach the crit immunity to &quot;Toughness&quot; since every tank has that talent (Bears with Thick Hide). Lower it down the tank trees a bit so dps cant subspec for it, then that should solve the issue.</div></div><hr />

Seriously man? Just because something new is implemented doesn't mean it's going to add ridiculous amounts of power. They are going to scale everything to balance it like they always do, it might take a couple weeks, but it will happen. Mainly because of people like you who would yell that paladins are getting a buff no matter what they are changing. They could declare &quot;We are removing all paladin abilities except crusader strike which will have a 1 second cooldown now&quot; and people would still yell OMG PALLIES ARE GETTING EVEN MORE OP. The exact mechanics aren't even released yet so freaking relax.<br />

<br />
Oh yeah, roleplaying is totally ruined when the names on your FRIENDS LIST are real names, because we all know that's where the role playing happens, on the friends list. Also, if your RP friend is named thrall123, he needs to learn to RP.</div></div><hr />

Your sentence about focus is very long and very annoying to read. Also remember it's all still beta and they're working on it. If any of the classes is unplayable right now, it will surely be fixed when Cataclysm comes out.<br />
<br />
Also you say that a lot of these questions are stupid, but I beg to differ. Perhaps you only looked at one or two classes, but having read them all I must say there are some very interesting questions and answers. Especially about Paladins, that's stuff we haven't heard much about before.<br />
<br />
There were a few good questions, but id say over 60% of them were horrible. And sorry about the rant but reading the questions like the bullshit ones about &quot;putting ghostcrawler mobs in&quot; were just annoying me because they were wasting time that could be used to answer real questions.<br />
<br />
Id say paladins/druids/priests/warriors/dk got ALOT of attention which is good, but hunters are being totally revamped and should have gotten a good amount of attention. I know at least 4 people on there who asked 5-8 hunter questions each and not one got answered. <br />
<br />
While i understand its beta and things are subject to change and definately will, alleviating concerns and insuring these changes are in the works are what needed to be said, go look on the hunter forums of cata, nothing is being said about their concerns when of all the classes right now they have the biggest concerns. I planned to reactivate my account for cata because i want to play a worgen hunter which is why im becoming sketchy on their plans for the hunters right now.<br />
<br />
I mean read the first 3 hunter questions.... All questions answered in previous dev posts and the pet tanking heroics? thats just a stupid question to say the least, the only worthwhile question hunters got answered was the 4th one. Questions that needed to be answered was: <br />
- Are you planning on bumping the focus generation for hunters back up to 6? because atm 3 is far to low and makes hunters stand around for awhile doing nothing.<br />
- With trying to remove the ability to run around 24/7 spamming abilities do you have any intentions to remove the deadzone of ranged for hunters? because atm players just run into melee range and spam instant spells etc and hunters cant generate focus from steady etc, and since alot of the melee moves have been removed/reduced to ensure hunter as a ranged class they are sitting ducks at that point?<br />
- From the question above you also run into the problem of key abilities like disengage costing 30 focus, and it being a key ability of suriving melee. Are there plans to remove the focus with the current system or will hunters have to keep 30 focus always for an ohshit button?<br />
<br />
Just some of the questions i personally and i know alot of other ppl would have liked to seen answered about hunters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can answer the first question just based on common sense alone. In fact, I'll answer it in two separate ways both leading to the same end result.<br />
<br />
A1: Because it's the FIRST IMPLEMENTATION and the not the FINAL one.<br />
A2: Because it's NOT FINISHED.<br />
<br />
Why would you think a massive overhaul to an existing system like this would be sparkly and shiny with its FIRST IMPLEMENTATION? To be perfectly honest, I'm surprised it's as clear and understandable as it is considering how badly they wanted the testers to get their hands on it for feedback. And before anyone goes on some random tangent, I'm not saying &quot;they don't want feedback&quot;. Quite the contrary, they do. But that question is certainly not feedback considering they stated from the get go that this is only a first pass.<br />
<br />
As for the whole cookie cutter thing; I really wish people would get off that shtick. There have been cookie cutter builds from the start. Yes, there have always been variations for SOME of the specs, but considering the current state of the talent trees, you cannot, with any authority, make the claim that they are not trying to reduce the cookie cutter specs. There's going to be variation choices with the final talent trees but instead of the having 5-10 points to wonder what to do with, you'll have maybe 3-6. The choices will be easier a<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok while you were hostile towards me im not gonna take the same route. Heres the thing while it is beta and it is the first implementation, THIS IS THE BIGGEST CONCERN OF BETA ATM. It should have been getting the most attention to &quot;reduce&quot; peoples fears. Have you even read the beta forums? <br />
<br />
http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=25969039843&amp;sid=2000&amp;pageNo=9<br />
<br />
90% of the feedback is bad, you have to take pretty much ever talent in a tree to move up to the next tier removing ALL CHOICE. While there was always and will always be an optimal build, you should have to think about the build before you just start throwing talents in. A build should not be so simple that you take 5-10 seconds thinking about it, you should have to weigh each talent and decide which will help you the most, not be spoon fed it. Just because its the first implementation also, doesnt mean thats not the route they are going, because if you read Ghostcrawlers posts via the dev tracker about the 31 points, youd actually see that THEY ARE PLANNING for the player to have LITTLE choice, for it to be new player friendly. So when i said what i said its justified because even tho it is beta and the first implementation after further reading the dev's posts on the matter it establishes the fears alot of people have as of the direction of the 31 point trees.<br />
<br />
At this rate they could just remove talents all together and make us click a tree and have it automatically go as we level, removing the time it takes to click the talents, because thats pretty much how the new tree will be unless drastically changed.</div></div><hr />

I can't agree more. and this doesn't apply only to holy. if your class is balance around this holy power to make the same dmg as the other class, you get kited CCed whatever, holy power will go down since I can't imaging it's not gonna decrease over time. So when you hit, you will hit for less. I want to see some changes, but honestly, it's gonna be totally lame for pvp at least. Classes balance around energy are limited in their ability depending on energy not on how hard they hit, you CC them, they gain rage/energy/RP, they attack, they use some, not the other way around. It's already stupid as ret to use mana on a judgment to regain some imo, now they want to make us oom and hit for even less, I don't get it.<br />
Through if they make something like energy when you start at full, it will likely be better for pve, since right now ramp is horribly long, but too powerful for pvp burst. I guess we'll see. <br />
My fear, like every patch, is they want to make something, and can't balance it in time, and go back how things were before before the patch..</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Q: What about some class specific quests for Cataclysm? I enjoyed them in the early levels of WoW!<br />
A: It’s very expensive to create class-specific raids given the literally thousands of new quests we are already adding for Cataclysm; however, we are going to have class-specific dungeon quests for everyone at levels 20 and 50. These won’t be as involved as, say, the old Benediction quest line, but they will give you a way to get some blue loot that isn’t otherwise available.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The man asks him about class specific quests, and he says class specific raids are expensive? Then goes to say there are low level class specific quests in dungeons which lack the complexity of the ones people are asking for? What a dodge, and how expensive could a quest be? Actually expensive or just more expensive than not making it at all? Nice to know cost is an issue when making the most lucrative PC game in the history of mmorpg's.<br />
<br />
The expensive resource is the time of the skilled people it takes to do the work within the constraints of the beta and release schedule, probably not the actual cash to pay them</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm... I wonder why they bothered to make 10 classes... Its too... Expensive ? <br />
<br />
The greatest part about WOW in the beginning were the class specific quests. But ofc they grew out of date as the game gets older. But what BLizzard is saying... that they are not bothering to make those anymore... But hey... thats the same Blizzard that is creating 3 main role classes in the game.... And maybe just 3 classes while they are at it.</div></div><hr />

Then moderators can check in on these users to see if they're just being tards and temp or perma ban them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&lt;walloftext&gt;<br />
<br />
Firstly, this reworking of the talent tree is starting to confuse and irritate me quite a bit. The original arguement was to give players more interesting choices; these new 31-point trees basically eliminate choice down to whether you're PvE or PvP, which is exactly where we are now. Looking through the proposed changes, I haven't taken any &quot;fun&quot; talents. My main is a shaman, and there are run speed buffs all over the trees, but I can't take any without losing healing or damage viability. So what's the point?<br />
<br />
One poster made a good comment: Fun talents are those that add abilities or change existing ones such that their class and spec feel unique. I wouldn't be quite that strict, I would argue that lower cooldowns and a few other things that poster rated as not &quot;fun&quot; fit that definition he gave, but this is on the right track. Most of the talents in these new 31-trees just feel mandatory, so why bother? While this is only the first iteration, Blizzard wouldn't post them if they weren't similar to what the ultimate goal will be.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the debate between Tobias and Mojo is like all other internet forum debates in process, but there are good points of substance here. The epic class quest idea is a really good one to me. It would certainly motivate me to see them all if they existed and were implemented well enough. And the major problem with WoW is that content is made passe too quickly at this point. A unique quest at say .. level 50 .. would take weeks to get too, x10 if you wanted to see them all. Asking to change the entire landscape of WoW though isn't reasonable. WoW was built around the level-gear-grind-raid-repeat formula. Asking to change to something else is like asking a racing game to let you start winning the hardest races by harvesting raddishes somehow. WoW is also certainly not a thorn in gaming development, every MMO made today &quot;borrows&quot; heavily from the major advancements WoW made on the MMO genre. While WoW itself has done its own fair share of borrowing, *cough**cough*Arenas*cough*cough*, it certainly improved on all the major flaws in the MMOs (read Everquest) that existed at the time.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, people are hilarious. Anyone claiming anything to be OP or UP at this point is a joke. Even if ret pallies got the ability to let their forbearance wings fly them around the battlefield while raining smiting fists of lightning on the poor sods beneath wouldn't mean squat if 4 other classes got the ability to insta-kill flying players. And please dont tell me that the game is easier now then it was then. You're using thoughts and ideas (Detailed boss strats, WoW Math, different raid compositions and synergies) that were non-existent back then. Vaelstraz and Garr (properly scaled of course) are probably not doable with todays raid comps, but Saurfang and Putricide would have broken up guilds if they existed back then on strat complexity alone. <br />
<br />
The simple fact Im seeing is this one. MMOs have a shelf-life. That's it, period. After awhile, the award winning-trend setting-money hoarding formula that won you fame and accolades will start to fade and grow mold. For most well made MMOs, it's about 5 years. WoW's unprescedented success has earned it probably 7 good years when it's all said and done. Blizzard knows this, thats why all the focus on SC2, D3 and the new MMO. They've already admitted that unique membership has probably plateaued. Quite honestly, the thing that would please me the most would be to see a semi-conclusion to the story (not necessarily killing the cannon). Kill off Deathwing/Kil'jaeden/Mal'Ganis/whoever else is still around save one or two big enemies, and watch as the races rebuild their empires in a relative peace as the camera pans out to a setting sun or whatever. Or have a near apocalypse with only a few survivors ... you know, whatever.<br />
