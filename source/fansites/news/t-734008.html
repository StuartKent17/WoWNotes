Cataclysm Class &amp; Mastery Systems Update<br />
When we first announced our design goals for class talent trees back at BlizzCon 2009, one of our major stated focuses was to remove some of the boring and &quot;mandatory&quot; passive talents. We mentioned that we wanted talent choices to feel more flavorful and fun, yet more meaningful at the same time. Recently, we had our fansites release information on work-in-progress talent tree previews for druids, priests, shaman, and rogues. From those previews and via alpha test feedback, a primary response we heard was that these trees didn&#8217;t incorporate the original design goals discussed at BlizzCon. This response echoes something we have been feeling internally for some time, namely that the talent tree system has not aged well since we first increased the level cap beyond level 60. In an upcoming beta build, we will unveil bold overhauls of all 30 talent trees.<br />
To Recap<br />
When players reach level 10, they are presented with basic information on the three specializations within their class and are asked to choose one. Then they spend their talent point. The other trees darken and are unavailable until 31 points are spent in the chosen tree. The character is awarded an active ability, and one or more passive bonuses unique to the tree they've chosen. As they gain levels, they'll alternate between receiving a talent point and gaining new skills. They'll have a 31-point tree to work down, with each talent being more integral and exciting than they have been in the past. Once they spend their 31'st point in the final talent (at level 70), the other trees open up and become available to allocate points into from then on. As characters move into the level 78+ areas in Cataclysm, they'll begin seeing items with a new stat, Mastery. Once they learn the Mastery skill from their class trainer they'll receive bonuses from the stat based on the tree they've specialized in.<br />
<br />
We understand that these are significant changes and we still have details to solidify. We feel, however, that these changes better fulfill our original class design goals for Cataclysm, and we're confident that they will make for a better gameplay experience. Your constructive feedback is welcomed and appreciated. <br />
<br />
Talent Tree Vision<br />
<br />
One of the basic tenets of Blizzard game design is that of &#8220;concentrated coolness.&#8221; We&#8217;d rather have a simpler design with a lot of depth, than a complicated but shallow design. The goal for Cataclysm remains to remove a lot of the passive (or lame) talents, but we don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s possible with the current tree size. To resolve this, we're reducing each tree to 31-point talents. With this reduction in tree size we need to make sure they're being purchased along a similar leveling curve, and therefore will also be reducing the number of total talent points and the speed at which they're awarded during the leveling process.<br />
<br />
As a result, we can keep the unique talents in each tree, particularly those which provide new spells, abilities or mechanics. We&#8217;ll still have room for extra flavorful talents and room for player customization, but we can trim a great deal of fat from each tree. The idea isn&#8217;t to give players fewer choices, but to make those choices feel more meaningful. Your rotations won&#8217;t change and you won&#8217;t lose any cool talents. What will change are all of the filler talents you had to pick up to get to the next fun talent, as well as most talents that required 5 of your hard-earned points.<br />
<br />
We are also taking a hard look at many of the mandatory PvP talents, such as spell pushback or mechanic duration reductions. While there will always be PvP vs. PvE builds, we&#8217;d like for the difference to be less extreme, so that players don&#8217;t feel like they necessarily need to spend their second talent specialization on a PvP build.<br />
<br />
The Rise of Specialization<br />
<br />
We want to focus the talent trees towards your chosen style of gameplay right away. That first point you spend in a tree should be very meaningful. If you choose Enhancement, we want you to feel like an Enhancement shaman right away, not thirty talent points later. When talent trees are unlocked at level 10, you will be asked to choose your specialization (e.g. whether you want to be an Arms, Fury or Protection warrior) before spending that first point. Making this choice comes with certain benefits, including whatever passive bonuses you need to be effective in that role, and a signature ability that used to be buried deeper in the talent trees. These abilities and bonuses are only available by specializing in a specific tree. Each tree awards its own unique active ability and passives when chosen. The passive bonuses range from flat percentage increases, like a 20% increase to Fire damage for Fire mages or spell range increases for casters, to more interesting passives such as the passive rage regeneration of the former Anger Management talent for Arms warriors, Dual-Wield Specialization for Fury warriors and Combat rogues, or the ability to dual-wield itself for Enhancement shaman.<br />
<br />
The initial talent tree selection unlocks active abilities that are core to the chosen role. Our goal is to choose abilities that let the specializations come into their own much earlier than was possible when a specialization-defining talent had to be buried deep enough that other talent trees couldn&#8217;t access them. For example, having Lava Lash and Dual-Wield right away lets an Enhancement shaman feel like an Enhancement shaman. Other role-defining examples of abilities players can now get for free at level 10 include Mortal Strike, Bloodthirst, Shield Slam, Mutilate, Shadow Step, Thunderstorm, Earth Shield, Water Elemental, and Penance. <br />
<br />
Getting Down to the Grit<br />
<br />
Talent trees will have around 20 unique talents instead of today's (roughly) 30 talents, and aesthetically will look a bit more like the original World of Warcraft talent trees. The 31-point talents will generally be the same as the 51-point talents we already had planned for Cataclysm. A lot of the boring or extremely specialized talents have been removed, but we don't want to remove anything that&#8217;s going to affect spell/ability rotations. We want to keep overall damage, healing, and survivability roughly the same while providing a lot of the passive bonuses for free based on your specialization choice.<br />
<br />
While leveling, you will get 1 talent point about every 2 levels (41 points total at level 85). Our goal is to alternate between gaining a new class spell or ability and gaining a talent point with each level. As another significant change, you will not be able to put points into a different talent tree until you have dedicated 31 talent points to your primary specialization. While leveling, this will be possible at 70. Picking a talent specialization should feel important. To that end, we want to make sure new players understand the significance of reaching the bottom of their specialization tree before gaining the option of spending points in the other trees. We intend to make sure dual-specialization and re-talenting function exactly as they do today so players do not feel locked into their specialization choice.<br />
<br />
A True Mastery<br />
<br />
The original passive Mastery bonuses players were to receive according to how they spent points in each tree are being replaced by the automatic passive bonuses earned when a tree specialization is chosen. These passives are flat percentages and we no longer intend for them to scale with the number of talent points spent. The Mastery bonus that was unique to each tree will now be derived from the Mastery stat, found on high-level items, and Mastery will be a passive skill learned from class trainers around level 75. In most cases, the Mastery stats will be the same as the tree-unique bonuses we announced earlier this year. These stats can be improved by stacking Mastery Rating found on high-level items.<br />

Blue posts<br />
&quot;Old&quot; masteries<br />
I would not focus too much on the old masteries, except for the third one that scales with gear. That one is still around. <br />
<br />
Vengeance for tanks is still around and dps get damage and healers get healing and that sort of thing but the system has changed quite a bit overall (and partially as a result of community feedback). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
Next beta build will be interesting<br />
We want to unveil the entire enchilada in the next beta build or so. Everyone here worked really hard to get the whole package to a relatively playable and polished state. In essence we're not announcing a future plan -- we're telling you how the game works today. It's all done.<br />
<br />
It's hard to offer timelines for when we will do a new beta push, but we're talking days or a few weeks, not months. All of the passives will be visible then. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
Talent Points gain rate<br />
About one every other level, but there are some exceptions. We are trying to alternate new abilities and talent points where possible. You will have 41 talent points at 85. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
Spec abilities scaling<br />
Specialization-defining abilities that are unlocked (e.g. Mutilate, Penance, Water Elemental and Mortal Strike) will scale based on a character's level and reflect an appropriate amount of damage, healing, and mitigation, etc. With the proper balancing, having these abilities at level 10 won't trivialize the leveling experience, but instead enhance it by allowing players to incorporate unique spells and skills that highlight their specialization into their rotations at a much earlier level.<br />
<br />
We'll be closely monitoring how these new talent changes affect gameplay in the beta and will make adjustments to the system if necessary to ensure that our original goals are met. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626580696/wont-getting-these-powerful-skills-early/))<br />
<br />
Dual Spec<br />
Dual Spec won't change. If you choose Protection paladin at level 10, you can respec to Ret paladin at your class trainer. Once you unlock Dual Spec, you can have 2 Prot builds or a Prot and Ret build or whatever you'd like. It will work almost exactly the way it does now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626050750/new-talent-changes-dual-spec-and-you/))<br />
<br />
New Talent system is ZOMG AMAZING<br />
It's ZOMG AMAZING. We wouldn't go through all the work it is taking if we weren't convinced it was 100% win.<br />
<br />
On your first point, too many of the specs didn't really feel like their spec until they had spent a lot of talents in the tree. All mages pretty much played the same until level 30 to 40 or so. Even with the Cataclysm changes, a Holy, Prot and Ret paladin would pretty much be using Crusader Strike and Judgements until they had several more abilities unlocked.<br />
<br />
On your second point, we know some players liked the option of spending some points in the first tree and then some in the second tree. Often this was just a trap for new players though because it delays your getting the 21, 31 and other &quot;gold medal&quot; talents that really define your tree. Experienced players might learn to get a 5/5/5 build or whatever and then respec once they could reach the 31, but we could also just make better trees that didn't ask you to do that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25712376053/talent-tree-changes-article/))<br />
<br />
How big are the new trees?<br />
They have 38-42 or so points in them. You could spend all 41 points in one tree, though often you'll want a 5/5/31 or a 0/7/34 build instead. Every talent is 1, 2 or 3 talent points. Earlier levels have about 8 points on them (typically a 2, 2, 3) and deeper levels have about 5 points on them (typically a 1, 2, 3). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
New Talent trees overview<br />
They look superficially like vanilla talent trees, but they are far more interesting.<br />
<br />
Almost without exception, the talents we cut were the ones everyone took or the ones nobody took. There will still be very attractive talents that probably everyone takes, but there are also definitely choices where you can only take A or B and want both. Typically you might see a useful (but not necessarily dps-enhancing) ability in your own tree, but also a really attractive one in another tree.<br />
<br />
This is a good thing. It won't surprise me to see a knee jerk reaction from some players that we're removing their favorite talents and &quot;dumbing down the trees.&quot; However, I'd challenge them that there can't be that many players out there that play Arcane because of Mind Mastery or Arms warrior because of Strength of Arms. Yet, if you skip either of those talents, you're just making your character less effective.<br />
<br />
A Cataclysm goal is to remove lame or boring talents. Yet we don't want to replace all of those with procs or game-changers. Really the only solution is to have smaller trees where nearly every remaining talent is a big deal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
Hybrid builds and active talents<br />
You typically won't get active abilities from a second tree. The most you can get in a second tree is 10 points, and usually the active abilities are deeper than this. We think it makes the distinction between say a Frost and Unholy DK more pronounced when all of their talented active abilities are different rather than being able to cherry pick the best from each tree. It does end up killing any chance for a build that goes halfway down two trees, but usually we would consider such builds failures because it meant the bottom of &quot;your&quot; tree wasn't good enough. These were most popular in PvP when players felt compelled to get &quot;must have&quot; PvP survival talents in multiple trees, and those are the kind of talents we want dead anyway.<br />
<br />
With these changes though, the talent trees are going to be even more rebuilt than we were already planning with Cataclysm. Talents are moving all over the trees and every tree has new talents as well. We'll give you a chance to see the trees soon (tm). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
Current talents are too complicated<br />
The new model theoretically buys us several more expansions of not having to mess with the overarching talent tree design. In a broader sense though, one of the challenges of working on World of Warcraft is adding new content without making the game totally inaccessible to new players.<br />
<br />
I have used this example several times, but we have one very senior designer at Blizzard who isn't working on WoW but obviously knows the game very well and has been very active in PvP and raiding at various points in time. He took a short break from the game (I suspect to play Modern Warfare 2) and when he came back, we had messed around with his class's talent trees and reset his talent points, so he felt like he couldn't jump back into the game again without spending 45 minutes researching what the community thought a good build would be. We're hoping with simpler (but still deep!) talent trees, players like him will feel more comfortable picking their own talents. He might eventually go poke around in theorycrafting forums to min / max his build, but he won't have the moment of being completely overwhelmed when looking at a blank talent tree. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
In previous expansions, more choices were given to the players in terms of how they built their characters. Players were freely given the choice to spend points however they want. <br />
[...] While that is true, they were also given ample opportunities to make mistakes, what we call &quot;traps.&quot; A forum-savy player may know which are the dumb talents nobody takes or which are the mandatory ones that might at first glance seem too bland to take. But why have &quot;choices&quot; that are just there for new players or people who just want to swim against the stream just to be different? We'd rather have actual legitimate choices, which we feel like we can offer by having a stable of fewer good talents.<br />
<br />
To use one of the infamous GC analogies, the best restaurants are not necessarily those with a lot of entrees on the menu. The best restaurants probably have very few choices, but you know that anything you order will be great. They don't bother cooking it if they know it will suck. That's a real choice as opposed to the diner with fish on the menu that everyone, ever the waitress, whispers under their breath that you should never, ever order. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
Dungeon Finder and new talent system<br />
We expect a lot of players to use Dungeon Finder while leveling up. The feature works great for that, and we're spending some effort to update the older dungeons to not be so overspawned and in some cases to even fit into the zone quest content better.<br />
<br />
Likewise, we're making an effort to let tank and healing specs be more effective when soloing. DPS specs will still probably be more efficient leveling, but if you just love the Resto shaman tree, you should be able to quest and run some dungeons without even having a dual-spec. It won't be spectacular, but it will be a huge improvement from today.<br />
<br />
Tanks and healers will get basic abilities before level 15 (when Dungeon Finder is available) to do their jobs, but it's also true that the lower level content is more forgiving of your talent spec. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
Vengeance<br />
You get it at level 10 for choosing a tanking tree. It already scaled with your health and incoming damage, so there isn't really a need for it to scale with talent points spent (especially since nearly 100% of tanks spend the most points in a tanking tree).

Feral builds with the new system<br />
Feral is a challenge. We still want to have a cat-centric, bear-centric or hybrid build. It has always been one of the more challenging trees to work on. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />

Holy signature ability<br />
We think healers will expect to get an actual heal (or some kind of defensive ability) as their signature spell, but we also want something that's actually useful at level 10. Lightwell, Circle of Healing and even Spirit of Redemption are very signature Holy abilities, but none are very useful when soloing gnolls in Elwynn.

Preparation<br />
It's a design flaw that rogues and locks are so dependent on Prep and Soul Link respectively. Those talents are currently holding the classes back. Now we can't balance around the assumption that you have those talents so your classes need to function without them. Maybe it means lowering base cooldowns....

<br />
Shadowstep<br />
Naturally, the 31-point Shadow Dance is totally inaccessible to Rogues speccing other trees. But what about Shadowstep? Is that a tree-specific, unpointed talent that is totally inaccessible to all other specs? <br />
Inaccessible. Shadowstep is essentially no longer a talent. There is nowhere to buy it. You don't get any passive bonuses for picking your second tree. Essentially you choose at level 10 whether to be an Assassination, Combat or Subtlety rogue, and while you can change your mind later, that determines what special ability and what passives you get.

Cool talents aren't going away<br />
Warlocks are hard. :) <br />
<br />
With a mage, you can keep Frost from throwing a lot of Fireballs just by making Frost do Frost damage. The warlocks don't have schools like that, and they have some shared spells, so it's tricky to get them to use the spells we want them to use sometimes. None of the cool talents, the ones that change up what you're doing, such as Molten Core or Backdraft, are going away. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />

Toughness stays, Vitality is a passive bonus<br />
Protection has one passive talent, which is Toughness. They get Vitality as a passive for choosing Protection at level 10. The other talents are a mix of threat and defensive abilities, but none are as passive as Deflection. There are (hopefully) attractive talents in the first two tiers of Arms and Fury. The other tank trees will be similar but not identical (Feral as always will be the least similar). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />

The Arms one for the moment is Two-Handed Weapon Spec (+10% damage with two-Handed weapons) and Anger Management (free rage). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))<br />
<br />
Arms - Mastery bonus in Cataclysm<br />
Mastery still exists, but the design is a little cleaner.<br />
<br />
Before:<br />
Arms got some passive damage per talent point.<br />
Arms got some passive armor pen per talent point.<br />
Arms got a chance to proc a swing per talent point, which is enhanced by mastery rating on gear.<br />
<br />
Now:<br />
Arms gets whatever it needs as passives at level 10.<br />
Arms gets a chance to proc a swing at level 78(ish), which is enhanced by mastery rating on gear.<br />
<br />
Mastery now means &quot;proc a swing&quot; for Arms and that's all it means, which is easier to understand. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626290470/31pt-talent-trees/))</div></div><hr />

As long as it is still &quot;good&quot; I don't really care actually. Of course it will be strange leveling and only getting one talent point every 2 levels. But I guess the one point is really worth more then that with the changes.</div></div><hr />

good way to get rid of a lot of &quot;useless&quot; and &quot;boring&quot; talents<br />
<br />
I'm more impressed about how it locks you into the first tree you start putting points on, forcing you to focus on that decision until you get to the 31-point talent</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't really expect them to have 51 cool talents for each tree. It's unreasonable. I'd rather the trees be smaller but have every talent be interesting than 50+ talents with 20-30 of them be akin to 'reduces mana cost of X by Y%' talents.<br />
<br />
Concept is a cool one, lets see how they fare with it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">evan_s</div><div class="date">2010-07-07, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty major change. Hard to say how it is going to end up because it is such a major change and we will have to wait and see what the trees look like and what abilities are automatic etc. I am not too surprised tho. Of the 3 classes I play, 2 have had some decent amount of changes in their talent trees already and they both struck me as rather underwhelming. Removing the &quot;boring&quot; talents seemed to kill a lot of the synergy that was available in your secondary tree. Even going up the main tree you seemed to be so lean on talents that you ended up with a cookie cutter build because there were just so few talents that were worth taking that you all ended up with the same thing after avoiding the PVP talents etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they are indeed reducing the amount per level. at 85 you will have 41 points to spend/spent, so a tree would look like 31/10/0 or 31/5/5 for example.<br />

anyways, i like the change.</div></div><hr />

One of the biggest problems I always found when I level a new class is that I feel unable to weigh up the benefits of a given talent at the earliest tiers without an idea of what my final spec will be like, and for that I always end up referring to external sources like Elitist Jerks. Hopefully this will make taking talents feel far less of a straitjacket and more focused into the kind of a &lt;class&gt; that you want to be.</div></div><hr />

I imagine it's so they'll have less unknowns to balance which I guess is good. This and the realID announcement yesterday just seem like complete 180's of what Blizzard used to say. &quot;We don't want you to feel you have to pick X, we want variety&quot; to now &quot;Well if you want to play in the spec then you gotta get all of these then you can spend leftovers elsewhere&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having less talent points to spend isn't tragic if there are less talents overall, and having less talents isn't sad as long as the ones they're removing are the genericy gain X damage Y crit Z haste ones. I'd welcome the opportunity to have more utility talents because some of my DPS increasing talents became passive. <br />
<br />
Also, hooray to getting core spec abilities early for choosing that talent tree. Being an assassination rogue without mutilate, or an enhance shaman without dual-wield, or a shadow priest without shadowform, has always been frustrating for those first forty levels.<br />
<br />
Also, it is a very small change but:<br />
<br />
<br />
When players reach level 10, they are presented with basic information on the three specializations within their class and are asked to choose one. <br />
<br />
Is a great and much-needed change. I have long lamented the fact that there is very little in-game that explains talent trees adequately for new players, and there's actually nothing that tells you you ever have them if you're not the kind of person who tends to &quot;explore&quot; by talking to NPCs and checking their options. Most of us began playing because of friends so it's not an issue for us, but really new players who maybe don't know anyone, it is. I didn't realise this myself until my father and uncle began playing together and I checked up on them at level 30 and saw neither had spend any talent points. Oops.</div></div><hr />

It's definitely interesting. Can't go either way on this decision. I'm just worried about those specs where all 3 specs are very very similar (Hunters/Rogues... Yes I know there are differences in play styles, but not enough) How are they going to make each spec feel like their own little snowflake. It seems that getting rid of most of the passive talents may just leave some specs empty husks with filler. Sadly that filler is usually the passive talents. So idk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why are you removing the PvP utility from priest talents that can be used for pvp then?<br />
<br />
Fx the one reducing dmg to you, and increasing healing if you get critted, but also gives 3% passive crit, you ruined that talent for PvE disc who likes BG also.<br />

A talent point every other level, rather than ever level. So you'll have somewhere in the neighborhood of like, 38 talent points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of us do prefer to level in the spec we intend to play at the cap, because we want an intimate familiarity with them that takes awhile to get if you just respec to it at the cap. I realise that folks like me are the minority, but we are out there. The new LFG tool also helps significantly with this, as people can level entirely through this means. Lastly, as part of the change of trimming out passive damage/healing/avoidance/mitigation/whatever talents in the talent trees means that a lot of people can afford to take &quot;DPS&quot; talents in their non-DPS tree. If you're getting a talent in holy that makes Smite rock -- and you're not taking it at the loss of a talent that buffs your healing -- it might be a nonissue.</div></div><hr />

I leveled a pally and warrior 1-70 (and then 80) as prot, and a shaman and priest 1-80 as healers. To the contrary, I think it will make being a tank and healer at lower levels better, cuz you will have some of the tools to help you do your job correctly at low level now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, NO... first of all... 31 points means that's how much it is for the final talent, not how many points are in the tree total. We have 51 point talents now, but most trees have a lot more then 51 points being able to be spent in them. You will not have to fill in one tree 100%.

<br />
They did anticipate this, and they said that it could be possible in the early levels for melee DPS classes to tank. That announcement itself sparked it's own brand of bitching without any thought.<br />
<br />
Just like people are bitching about this now. All of you have level 80s, and this does not concern you, this is not adding content, this is a plan to completely restructure the talent trees. So that when you DO decide to make an alt to play through 1-60 cataclysm, it won't be boring. IT.WILL.NOT.BE.BORING<br />
<br />
BORING. REMOVE THE BORING. Remove the passive bonuses that level 80/85s do not care for because they already have the points required, <br />
<br />
Do you people understand? as soon as you hit level 10, it GIVES you, an explanation of how the talent tree you want to pick works, and it gives you skills, that would normally be out of your reach until level 20/40/50/etc. <br />
<br />
I can't wait to see how they handle this. That's IF they decide to go through with this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
K Bye.<br />
<br />
OT, I love the idea of these new changes. Extensively playing around with my trees in the talent calculator gave me a wierd feeling idd. As somebody mentioned before. They were too bloated, and we simply had too many talent points to spend. Choices litterally meant nothing, as you could take as talents in your main tree, and you would have enough. Enough points to use the entire tree if you wanted to. That is not good at all. Now, 41 points to spend simplifies things a lot. 31 mandatory points in your main tree, 10 elsewhere. I'm sure the trees will still have a lot of choice. But all the annoying pointless ones will be gone. That is a good thing. <br />
<br />
Think to the future, level 100 toons with 91 talent points to spend. Rediculous. Something had to be done. As good a time as any imo. <br />
<br />
Anyway, nobody here at all, has any right of opinion untill we see the trees themselves. Cataclysm is NOT Wrath. Forget all you know about WoW when considering new info like this. Hold judgement until we learn more on the issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They say that they are going to fix the trees by giving less talents and then force everyone to spend 31 points in the trees. This is just lame. Why don't they just remove talent trees altogether and just let us select what tree we want. This will take all the thinking out of it for us and let blizzard fine tune it to a degree where they don't have to worry about balance because everyone will have the same talents. In the end everyone will be running with the best spec for raiding or pvp for the tree of that spec anyways.<br />
<br />
What blizzard should do is remove talents altogether and give us all the skills and let gear make the difference as to how we play period. We all know a class like a pally can tank, heal, or dps so why not just let their gear make them optimal for this?</div></div><hr />

You rarely do that anyways now - you go for the strong 51 pointer and then the rest of the talents is abit meh n meh..It could be great if endleveling ( 75-85 ish) had more powerfull talents too pick then now - but on he other hand, the higher lvls is rewarded with new abillitys and spells ( Magelust, Dust balls, Warlock Wings etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Also, I'm all for removing passive talents that are almost mandatory when picking a spec. You have a choice when making a spec, and that's the right way, or the completely wrong way. At least this way, I won't have to play with players who pick the wrong way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They say that they are going to fix the trees by giving less talents and then force everyone to spend 31 points in the trees. This is just lame. Why don't they just remove talent trees altogether and just let us select what tree we want. This will take all the thinking out of it for us and let blizzard fine tune it to a degree where they don't have to worry about balance because everyone will have the same talents. In the end everyone will be running with the best spec for raiding or pvp for the tree of that spec anyways.<br />
<br />
What blizzard should do is remove talents altogether and give us all the skills and let gear make the difference as to how we play period. We all know a class like a pally can tank, heal, or dps so why not just let their gear make them optimal for this?<br />

This is really the only way they can give out spec-defining abilities from the start. Without this restriction, what's to keep someone from (for example) saying they are an enhancement shaman to get dual wield and then putting all their points into elemental or resto? This new system is kinda like a loan: &quot;we'll give you top-tier abilities from the start, but only if you promise to actually spend enough points eventually to qualify for those abilities&quot;.<br />
<br />
I agree that its too bad we don't have more freedom under the new system, but I think getting those key abilities from the start without having to worry about balance concerns where other specs could get stuff they shouldn't will out-weigh any negatives of these restrictions.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think this should be a really cool change and can't wait to see the new trees! :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pojodan</div><div class="date">2010-07-07, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like this for the following reason:<br />
<br />
In a given class' talent trees currently there are 3-5 talents that actually alter the way the class is played. I'm a Combat Rogue, so I'll use that as an example.<br />
<br />
Adrenaline Rush, Blade Fury, Killing Spree, non-dagger, fast off-hand/slow main-hand. Those are what define combat rogue.<br />
<br />
31 points means 7 tiers, if they keep with the 5-points-per-tier model.<br />
<br />
With 5 talents that define the class, that leaves only 2 tiers with filler talents, making each step up the talent tree all the more thrilling.<br />
<br />
Also, it opens up the realm for a lot wider talent trees for more 'filler', but lots of possibilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can see there being three different groups of 'filler' talents that populate every tier: Damage Mitigation, Damage Evasion, Utility<br />
<br />
Say I'm in a guild with 3 other combat rogues. At present, only one of us is bringing anything unique to the raid, the rest are just plain DPS. I perform average in dealing with boss encounter challenges, one other rogue dies constantly, and the other is flawless.<br />
<br />
I would thusly spec myself for Damage Evasion, talents that make me move faster or let me escape one insta-death per boss fight, or talents of that nature for my occational slip-ups. The second rogue would spec in Damage Mitigation, talents that reduce AoE damage, lessen big damage hits so they aren't insta-death, and slow DoT effects, letting the healers keep them alive a lot more easily despite their poor performance. The last rogue would spec utility as, since they can be trusted to move to the right spot and do the right things, they can be the one that improves the raid with extra physical damage debuffs, extra threat redirection, extended smoke cloud duration, things of that nature.<br />
<br />
Of course there will be min/maxing by selecting all the utility talents, but it opens up extra leway for less skillful players to survive better, as well as giving options for guilds struggling with boss fights to re-spec into survival-oriented talents across the board so that learning a difficult fight is less stressful.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping it works that way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fcdwn777</div><div class="date">2010-07-07, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that a lot of people that disagree with this change did not read the whole post and/or put words into Blizz's mouth. I think this is an amazing change. Leveling a new character has never been very exciting skill wise. I mean, once you hit level 10, a lot of classes only had choices to start putting talents into the &quot;Increases the damge you do with x by x%&quot;. BORING. When you level a toon talent points are only exciting if you are putting them into a fun talent, which many of them are not atm. Our talent trees are bloated and need to be trimmed down. I heard someone say something to the effect of &quot;I used to look forward to spending talents points each time I level and now I will get nothing!&quot; Well, this is not true at all. They said they are going to alternate getting new skills and talent points. And if we are honest, most of the time new abilities are more interesting then a talent point to increase your damage by 1%.<br />
<br />
But you are still going to be getting talent points every other level that will be more meaningful then they ever were. As far as Blizz forcing you to go down one tree till 70, it seems this is mainly done for new players. Sure there is more freedom at the moment to spec however you want, but imagine how this can be for new players. SO many options with no real guidance as what to do. Correctly spent talents can be the difference between a great leveling experience and a bad one. I welcome this change also and cant wait to actually have fun and meaningful abilities at level 10. I mean, shadow step and lava lash at leve 10? How awesome is that? And it totally makes leveling a character much more engaging and playable. Kudos to Blizz on making this much needed change. People need to realize that more does not equal better.<br />
<br />
On another note, I saw someone say that now you just have to sit back and watch the talent trees fill themselves out? WTF? Did you even read the post? It said nothing of the kind in there, you will still have to choose all your talents. You will just be restricted to one tree until level 70. And people are actually claiming that trimming the fat from our bloated talent trees and making points more meaningful and exciting is catering to casuals? If making my low level toons more fun to play by giving them things like shield slam and mutilate is catering to casuals, bring on the casuals then.</div></div><hr />

Where are all in the post that is says that all they are doing is cutting out the boring talents and keeping the same talent trees? What I got from the post is that they will be overhauling the talent trees like they said they were doing anyways and giving us new talents and new abilites, and trimming the useless fat off the talent trees.

<br />
What I would rather see is the ability to custom tailor a spec with abilities that I want. Sure, get rid of the useless abilities and junk no one uses. But let me be the type of warrior I want to be. Let me pick and choose abilities from different trees. Let me hybridize a cross between being a protection and a fury warrior (if I so choose). <br />
<br />
I don't see this at all as allowing people to make talent choices &quot;that feel more flavorful and fun, yet more meaningful at the same time.&quot; If each tree is just 31 points, that means you have to take everything in a tree. No picking and choosing. I really think that's what is needed. Like this, as a fury warrior, I'll be just like every other fury warrior.</div></div><hr />

This new system is kinda like a loan: &quot;we'll give you top-tier abilities from the start, but only if you promise to actually spend enough points eventually to qualify for those abilities&quot;.<br />
<br />
I agree that its too bad we don't have more freedom under the new system, but I think getting those key abilities from the start without having to worry about balance concerns where other specs could get stuff they shouldn't will out-weigh any negatives of these restrictions.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think this should be a really cool change and can't wait to see the new trees! :-)<br />
<br />
^This totally. I can't wait to level a new character in Cata with meaningful talents right away and a revamped Azeroth to level through!</div></div><hr />

Some talents will always be better than others, there's no way around it.<br />
The point is, with this new system you will be COMPETITIVE without having to give up fun talents. No-one is going to truly care if you sacrifice marginal max DPS in order to have fun talents.* <br />
<br />
* - Except min/max progression guilds, but their fun is defeating content and not 'fun' rotations or abilities.<br />
<br />
Edit: I find it very ironic people pine for the days of Vanilla before &quot;casualization&quot; and then an announcement of returning back to the same depth for trees won't be &quot;enough choice&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I healed my (arms warrior, 2 handed tanking) wife through RFC and Deadmines last night as a spriest.<br />
<br />
Whilst I realize those are super easy instances to tank and heal through Blizz has stated that they wanted to allow a warrior to tank a non heroic instance simply by slapping on a sword and board and switching into defensive stance.<br />

People who specialize in a tank or healing spec will simply be better at their chosen job. With the new additions of higher end/defining skills they will be even more effective.</div></div><hr />

A trimming of the trees is a logical consequence.<br />
<br />
I'm not a fan of the restriction to spending talent-points in 1 tree and I'm not sure why it's needed.<br />
<br />
As has been stated before, the reason you are locked into a talent tree is because they are offering you deep tier abilities at level 10 that usually take till level 40 or beyond. Since they are doing this, it only makes sense that you need to spend your talents in the same tree as the abilities you are given, because if not you can have a Ele shaman with deep tier enhance abilities if you are not restricted to a certain tree. I for one think this is a fine trade off to make leveling interesting again in the lower levels.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">elrenno</div><div class="date">2010-07-07, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like this for the following reason:<br />
<br />
In a given class' talent trees currently there are 3-5 talents that actually alter the way the class is played. I'm a Combat Rogue, so I'll use that as an example.<br />
<br />
Adrenaline Rush, Blade Fury, Killing Spree, non-dagger, fast off-hand/slow main-hand. Those are what define combat rogue.<br />
<br />
31 points means 7 tiers, if they keep with the 5-points-per-tier model.<br />
<br />
With 5 talents that define the class, that leaves only 2 tiers with filler talents, making each step up the talent tree all the more thrilling.<br />
<br />
Also, it opens up the realm for a lot wider talent trees for more 'filler', but lots of possibilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can see there being three different groups of 'filler' talents that populate every tier: Damage Mitigation, Damage Evasion, Utility<br />
<br />
Say I'm in a guild with 3 other combat rogues. At present, only one of us is bringing anything unique to the raid, the rest are just plain DPS. I perform average in dealing with boss encounter challenges, one other rogue dies constantly, and the other is flawless.<br />
<br />
I would thusly spec myself for Damage Evasion, talents that make me move faster or let me escape one insta-death per boss fight, or talents of that nature for my occational slip-ups. The second rogue would spec in Damage Mitigation, talents that reduce AoE damage, lessen big damage hits so they aren't insta-death, and slow DoT effects, letting the healers keep them alive a lot more easily despite their poor performance. The last rogue would spec utility as, since they can be trusted to move to the right spot and do the right things, they can be the one that improves the raid with extra physical damage debuffs, extra threat redirection, extended smoke cloud duration, things of that nature.<br />
<br />
Of course there will be min/maxing by selecting all the utility talents, but it opens up extra leway for less skillful players to survive better, as well as giving options for guilds struggling with boss fights to re-spec into survival-oriented talents across the board so that learning a difficult fight is less stressful.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping it works that way.<br />
<br />
I don't see it that way. What I read is that each tree will be 31 points. You will have to put a full 31 points into a tree (until level 70) before you can put points into another tree. What this tells me is that every combat rogue will be exactly the same. No customization. No variety. I don't see how this is an improvement at all. Makes it kinda boring if you ask me.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crash</div><div class="date">2010-07-07, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I, for one, am already liking this new system.<br />
As an Arms warrior, I had to wait a long time to get Mortal Strike, and then wait some more to have it improved, and then wait some more to have it glyphed, and then wait some more to have the stuff that goes with it, and then...y'know what I mean.<br />
<br />
This new system grants any warrior who choses to specialize in Arms, the possibility to actually USE this spec-defining ability quite early in their levelling. And this goes for all classes and specs.<br />
<br />
Putting this out of the tree will give us some choices and uniqueness.<br />
Of course there will still be some mandatory options, but with only 41 points to spend, shortened trees, no more &quot;5 points to get the max awesomeness&quot; abilities (I'm hoping 3 for MAX), and possibly new talents to choose from in each tree, I think we finally have what everyone has been claiming for for ages : trees will be our own choices !! Not a random copy-paste from a random website that claims itself for l33ts. Ours.</div></div><hr />

From what I read, at level 85, you would have 41 talent points to spend. So it would be more like 31/10/0.</div></div><hr />

I believe they really try to put as many exciting passives and spells they can into the talent trees without homogenizing the classes. So, reducing the overall size of the trees makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
My only concern is, how many possible talent points you can spend in each tree, ie how specialized in each individual tree you can be. For example they said you would have 42 points to spend by 85...will there will 40 points of talents in each tree....50? I realize there is not a ton of specialization in each tree as is, but I hope this new, shorter talent tree won't make spending points a no-brainer since you can't put points into other trees, and hopefully does not allow for more cookie-cutter builds. Choosing talents within your tree should be hard, and makes things more fun, hopefully there is still some options you get in choosing talents, as opposed to just having enough points for everything.<br />

Reread it they said 31-point talents not 31 talent points. Just look at the current trees. We've got 51-point talents currently but there are a lot more than 51 points available in each tree. I can guarantee that they aren't making trees that you have to pick one which then automatically fills up because you get as many points as there are talents in the trees.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Semiraghe</div><div class="date">2010-07-07, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some important information people seem to be missing is that the trees are going to be 31 points deep, not 31 points. Blizzard even said the following.<br />
<br />
&quot;and aesthetically will look a bit more like the original World of Warcraft talent trees&quot;<br />
<br />
Those trees were 31 points deep if I remember correctly, but you still had other places to put your 31 points. Thus the important thing to rmember here is that to get the last talent in the tree you will have to put 30 points in, just like you have to put the 50 points in now. They might be saying that you have to take the last talent to get the other trees but I'm reading it as your tree will just be 31 deep.<br />
<br />
Now I could be wrong and I think blizzard made a mistake in not releasing some trees to go with this annoucment. They could have answered a lot of questions right there. I think this has the potential to be really good from a couple of perspectives.<br />
<br />
1. It makes talents you choose more fun. More fun is more better. It could turn out this fails and just is a cookie cutter creater, but I'm hoping not.<br />
<br />
2. I think it helps the casuals, which helps you. This one requires a bit more explanation, but it boils down to the fact that you have someone play a certain way for 40 to 60 levels and then it suddenly changes with one new skill. Giving you those early skills early on lets you learn how to play the way you are going to play at end game. Thus the casuals who don't read forums like this are going to understand their class role better due to less drastic changes by getting those changes early. If they understand their role better they are going to play better, which makes your raids and bgs better.<br />
<br />
Edit: I feel like they should change the lock in. Perhaps allow you to put 1 point in the other trees for every 2 points you spend in your spec tree. This keeps you from being ret build with a prot spec for the bonus like they are trying with the lock in, but allows you to pick up useful talents earlier if you want.</div></div><hr />

A complete and total overhaul of the talent system isn't particularly surprising. They're overhauling the basic mechanics of the game, why not overhaul one of the defining features of the game as well? For those of you crying about the loss of your 'specs' that don't utilize a full tree; you're complaining based on knowledge of the current talent system. You have no idea how the new talents will be set up or the abilities you'll get just by being X/Y/Z spec of a class.<br />
<br />
As for the RealID forum bit... meh? There's no way it'll hit production. At least not where everyone in the world could see your name. It'll probably be more of a port from the current set-up in-game, and they'll limit it to your RealID friends that can see your real name, and everyone else would see a nickname of your choosing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">h3lladvocate</div><div class="date">2010-07-07, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not looking forward to these changes for a couple of reason. First of all, I believe this allows for less customization rather than more. Only have 31 talent points allowed for a tree, unless each talent is a 1 or 2 point max talent, there is going to be a clear cut winner, and you wont have the talents to spare to pick up something &quot;fun&quot;. <br />
<br />
Another problem I feel this has is, for example, I love the current Disc tree. It has a lot of fun and interesting talents. A few mandatory ones, but still, Borrowed Time, Archangel, PI, and so many other talents are really cool. I just don't see it being possible to take that tree, make it into a 31 point tree. And add some more &quot;filler fun&quot; talents and still get the same affect plus some fun, non-dps/heal/tank talents to choose from and NOT lose anything valuable in the tree. <br />
<br />
Lastly, this is just bad PR on blizzards fault. All the feedback, including mine is made of assumptions. And since change almost always adheres to bad assumptions, everyone gets mad at blizzard. They should of at least released 2-3 example talent trees so we know what they are talking about and we can compare and see if this would actually work well. Right now, most of us, including me, are assuming there will still be lots of 5/5 talents and with only 31 points per tree, 40ish points total at 85, there will be little to no customization, and I don't like that. In fact, the talent system is one of the best features of WoW over other MMO's. Not many others have such a high level of customization where there are 3 different tree's per class and dozens of way to play each tree, although not all ways are widely accepted. I think we'll just have to wait and hope blizzard knows that the hell they are doing... This could make or break cataclysm in my opinion.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">elrenno</div><div class="date">2010-07-07, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems that a lot of people that disagree with this change did not read the whole post and/or put words into Blizz's mouth. I think this is an amazing change. Leveling a new character has never been very exciting skill wise. I mean, once you hit level 10, a lot of classes only had choices to start putting talents into the &quot;Increases the damge you do with x by x%&quot;. BORING. When you level a toon talent points are only exciting if you are putting them into a fun talent, which many of them are not atm. Our talent trees are bloated and need to be trimmed down. I heard someone say something to the effect of &quot;I used to look forward to spending talents points each time I level and now I will get nothing!&quot; Well, this is not true at all. They said they are going to alternate getting new skills and talent points. And if we are honest, most of the time new abilities are more interesting then a talent point to increase your damage by 1%.<br />
<br />
But you are still going to be getting talent points every other level that will be more meaningful then they ever were. As far as Blizz forcing you to go down one tree till 70, it seems this is mainly done for new players. Sure there is more freedom at the moment to spec however you want, but imagine how this can be for new players. SO many options with no real guidance as what to do. Correctly spent talents can be the difference between a great leveling experience and a bad one. I welcome this change also and cant wait to actually have fun and meaningful abilities at level 10. I mean, shadow step and lava lash at leve 10? How awesome is that? And it totally makes leveling a character much more engaging and playable. Kudos to Blizz on making this much needed change. People need to realize that more does not equal better.<br />
<br />
On another note, I saw someone say that now you just have to sit back and watch the talent trees fill themselves out? WTF? Did you even read the post? It said nothing of the kind in there, you will still have to choose all your talents. You will just be restricted to one tree until level 70. And people are actually claiming that trimming the fat from our bloated talent trees and making points more meaningful and exciting is catering to casuals? If making my low level toons more fun to play by giving them things like shield slam and mutilate is catering to casuals, bring on the casuals then.<br />
<br />
The problem I've read here is that each tree will be 31 points. You will have to put a full 31 points into one tree before you can put points into another tree. So that means that every combat rogue will be exactly the same, talent-wise. No picking and choosing. I feel like this pigeon holes everyone into a specific type of game play. <br />
<br />
I'd rather see something that says you have 10 talents to pick from, choose 6. Or something like that. Then, as a fury warrior, I could have talents that make me somewhat unique. <br />
<br />
I'm just not crazy about this setup they've proposed.</div></div><hr />

This is not lazy as some seem to think. Lazy was adding more and more onto the existing trees bloating them more and more every time.<br />
Certainly the lack of a point per level will be missed with it being seen as something to aim for, but levelling should be about more than just getting the next point.<br />
Locking into a tree has potential, particularly when you get that bonus as a result of it, just it will lock you out from other useful talents as someone brought up the subject of Omen of Clarity.<br />
Taking longer to reach your signature, and often pretty damn useful end-talent is not likely to be a popular move, and I hope there is enough in the tree to provide sufficient utility for your role to make up for that.<br />
As to how well it will work out, we have to see, but most of you should stop flaming an idea which you do not like, before we have even seen it, and providing no arguement whatsoever other than your opinion.</div></div><hr />

I think the general idea is to cut all the mandatory talents out (brain dead stuff like Cruelty, core tree abilities such as Mortal Strike) and move them to passives through specialization so that you're given more talent options at each tier level. It'd give you the opportunity to take talents that you wanted but had to ignore to flesh out your 51/x/20 spec in WotLK.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Genju</div><div class="date">2010-07-07, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is not a single bad thing about the changes.<br />
They get rid of all &quot;You deal x% more dmg,y%crit&quot;, aka all the talents u had to skill to not get called &quot;n00b&quot;,&quot;rofl how u skilled&quot;,......<br />
and its not like you lose those which separates you as a DD from a non-DD spec, cause u get them passivly.<br />
<br />
With this system leveling a twink is way more entertaining, and nearly every talent point u get is like &quot;oh hey now i get a funny new talent&quot; and not like &quot;hey i got a lvl up, yay now i put my third talentpoint in a row in +1% dmg &quot;/cheer&quot; .<br />
<br />
About the commitment to spend all 31 points in a row in a talent tree:<br />
who doesnt do this atm? 99% of all twinks go all out in one talent tree to get the one special active skill you need to level more satisfied. Now u get it from the start. -&gt; big improvement.</div></div><hr />

You will have to put a full 31 points into one tree before you can put points into another tree. So that means that every combat rogue will be exactly the same, talent-wise. No picking and choosing. I feel like this pigeon holes everyone into a specific type of game play. <br />
<br />
I'd rather see something that says you have 10 talents to pick from, choose 6. Or something like that. Then, as a fury warrior, I could have talents that make me somewhat unique. <br />
<br />
I'm just not crazy about this setup they've proposed.<br />
<br />
Um. You do realise that isn't how talent trees work right. They're talking about the depth of trees, not total points. Current trees are 51-points deep, that doesn't mean you can only spend 51-points in them. The whole point is you CAN choose talents you want without being penalised in your role beyond marginal &quot;maxed out&quot; difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to be honest, im not sure i agree on these changes though. Having less talent points &quot;might&quot; seem boring with it now takes you 10 levels to max a talent insted of 5. I cant even begin to think what they will do to the Ret Pally tree, as most people have 20 free talant points to spend on NOTHING anyway. While Enhancement shaman and maybe MM hunters all have some pretty exciting talent trees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You didn't read good enough, or didn't understand what you read.<br />
&quot;31 points deep&quot; is different than &quot;31 points tree&quot;.<br />
Today, we have 51 points deep trees, not 51 points trees : you need 51 points to use the last talent, but you can put more than 51 points into that tree.<br />
The latter is what we're getting for Cata : more than 31 slots to put talent points into, but the last talent in said tree will be 31 points.</div></div><hr />

And to those saying that all specs will look the same then you obviously didnt read the blue post. All they are doing is restricting you to 1 tree once you choose where to put your first point.<br />
<br />
And once you get your 31 points in that tree all that happens is the unlocking of the other trees, this does not mean that you are done with your first tree and you have to switch to another. You can always continue filling it up if that's what you like.<br />
<br />
All in all this is going to make the leveling experience awesome for veteran players and for the new ones(i can already imagine it level 10 druid in boomkin form and priests with shadow form =D).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to have the 31 point talent regardless. Hybrid split speccing will be a thing of the past. It makes perfect sense since trying to balance a hybrid is much harder than trying to balance around pures. Of course, since you are required to have the 31 point talent, the 31 point talent will be part of your maximum performing spec.</div></div><hr />

As for the scaling in each level, you'll still have increased stats and the ability to use higher level items with each increase. So its not completely neutered it.<br />

I'll reserve judgement until I see this first hand.</div></div><hr />

Where this change really shines is in the early leveling, top level toons will simply have all the same abilities/buffs/etc just in less points. Imagine running Deadmines with an tank, healer and dps group that are actually specced for their roles and able to use all/many of the abilities of high level toons just less powerful. I think it will bring ALOT more fun to running early dungeons.<br />
<br />
What this change does is it makes players actually play a role rather then be a mess of inefficiency. Plus with Blizzard making big moves to have healers and tanks deal more damage it makes speccing as a tank or healer viable with leveling.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has said that 31 points will be needed before spending in other trees but it doesn't say how many point options will be available per tree. I pressume there will be many options and not JUST 31 points worth of choices. Therefore you will have diversity and variation one resto shaman to the next, although not to the point of overwhelming us with options.</div></div><hr />

I think it's more you'll have tanks and healers at level 10 instead, since you'll get your signature abilities immediately upon selecting a specialization.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suspect that there will be options to go down still making you have a choice and that early tier talents on the other trees will be universal to all build but each providing different effects.<br />
<br />
Who said that omen of clarity wont be a tier 1 talent hmm. Cause i know that all druid builds pretty much want it. Heck maybe with the change they will make omen of clarity passive because every druid does want it.<br />
<br />
I say don't fly off the handle when your full of it. Wait and see what happens with the talent trees. Now if only we had an actual date for when we get to see these new builds.</div></div><hr />

I see it as its okay but, maybe blizzard should make it so yes you can go between two specs but that first talent point you get and talent it into one tree grants you the mastery to that spec and that spec only regardless of how many talent points is in another spec. By doing that someone could yeah get dual wield elemental but they would be a really bad one because of no mastery to help them out.</div></div><hr />

You know very little about the game in general if you honestly think you have to fill in all talents to get to the 31 point talent. That has never been the case. There have always been choices below that 31 point talent and there will continue to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably everyone that wants to have an instance dungeon queue come up instantly instead of waiting for 30 minutes to run one dungeon. Lots of people level as tanks and healers now because doing so in the random dungeon system is faster than questing. Also, healer and tank specs normally have a much easier time questing with less down time and easier completion of group quests.</div></div><hr />

Which is that you'll be making choices between utility, fun talents. Some may increase you DPS, or w\e, but a lot are survivability things, or utility. <br />
<br />
So as a Destro lock I could decide, do I want Shadowfury to stun those adds, or should I pick up Nether Protection to make me easier to heal on that one fight. <br />
Or as Demonology do I want Improved hearthstones for the raid or do I want Demonic Resilience to help stay alive. <br />
<br />
Things like that, sure some talents will always be better...But you can't really say that your going to use shadowfury in a DPS rotation, and its a DPS loss not to get it.</div></div><hr />

If this one class that you've played for so long happens to be an 80, this change should not even concern you that much, unless it's a class which you'd normally wouldn't gun for the 51 point talent and go for something else. IF that's the case, you're going to see some changes there.<br />
<br />
You people need to understand WHY locking the trees until you've spent 31 points in the one you have chosen. They are doing away with so many passive talents, and keeping the important ones around, this applies to the other tree as well!<br />
<br />
If you keep all of them unlocked, and you get to a certain level where you get a spell from one tree and one from the other, it could be a potential gamebreaker.<br />
<br />
I want to see this idea go through. I can only see the &quot;pigeon holing&quot; that is necessary to be the only problem, unlike path of the titans, which had a vague system or guild leveling, which could break a guild just because someone is not agreeing with the talent points spent (It can happen).</div></div><hr />

<br />
With a change like this, they would have to implement the new trees for all classes at the same time. Judging by the fact that Blizzard has been trying to keep a lid on major changes while they are being developed, and the fact that the blue post mentions the next beta patch, I fully expect to see at least a first pass of the new talent trees for EVERY class perhaps as early as this week.<br />
<br />
This also explains why we haven't gotten any new info on revamped talents since that first batch was released a while ago. They must have decided that it just wasn't working how they wanted with the first set, so they set off in a new direction and have just gotten it to the point where the new system is ready for the beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because you'll get class defining abilities you wouldn't otherwise get until late?<br />
<br />
If you 'picked' one tree, but then leveled up the rest of your points in a different one, you'd be getting major talents from tree 1, and then more abilities from tree 2.<br />
<br />

I think you missed his point. He's arguing why lockout the other trees until 31pts are spent in one tree, not that you needed to put points in every talent.</div></div><hr />
