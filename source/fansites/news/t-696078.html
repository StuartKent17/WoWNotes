Addon Review - Altoholic<br />
Today I'll highlight an addon I've been using a lot lately: Altoholic (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/altoholic.aspx). Basically, this is the ultimate tool for anyone who spends too much time logging in and out of the game to check if something is or isn't on an alt. It lists pretty much every info you could need about your characters and you will never have to go through all the chars on your account to find who is exalted with the Ebon Hold, or who has 300 Stone Keeper shards in his stash.<br />
<br />
Altoholic on Curse (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/altoholic.aspx)<br />
<br />
Features<br />
Languages supported: enUS, frFR, deDE, esES, ruRU, zhCN &amp; zhTW.<br />
<br />
&lt;ul&gt; Account-wide data summary:&#13;&lt;ul&gt; Characters' talents: Full talent trees &amp; glyphs are supported for both specializations.&#13; Money, /played, rest xp for each character, subtotals by realm, and grandtotals for the account.&#13; Bag usage: see at a glance which characters should get bigger bags (bag size, free slots and types included)&#13; Characters' skills: skill summary on one screen, namely the 2 main professions + the 3 secondary skills as well as riding. I may add more if there's demand.&#13; Reputations: a list of all the reputations of the current realm's characters. You can see at a glance if all your alts are at least honored with Honor Hold if you want to get the new 2.4 blue PVP set. Suggestions on how to grind reputations will be available soon.&#13;[/list][/list]<br />
View containers (bags, bank, keyring) of all alts, on all realms.<br />
Guild banks : You have 10 alts in 10 different guilds on the same server, all of them with access to a guild bank ? Not a problem, you can see them all here.<br />
E-mail: allows you to see which alts have mail without having to reconnect them. The addon will tell you when mail is about to expire on a character. Threshold configurable (up to 15 days). Multiple realm support as well. Mails sent to a known alt (one you've logged on at least once) will be visible in the addon without having to reconnect it.<br />
Equipment: See the equipment of the current realm's alts in one screen. Very useful when purchasing stuff for your alts at the AH. Multiple realms supported. Right-clicking any equipment piece will allow you to find an upgrade, this feature is similar to the official wow armory feature, and is quite performant, even though it doesn't match the accuracy of the official one.<br />
Search: the most important feature of the addon, it uses an AH-like frame to display search results. You can either search bags on the current realm, on all realms, or a loot table. The loot table is a table based on AtlasLoot, but which contains only item id's, and therefore keeps memory usage minimal.<br />
The Search menu allows you to find items based on their name (even partial), level, type or rarity, almost like at the AH. It is also possible to search known recipes.<br />
Quest Log: See the quest logs of all your alts, as well as an indication of which alts are on a specific quest. Clicking on a quest link in the chat log will tell you which alts are on that quest.<br />
Suggestions: Currently, only profession leveling suggestions are available when mousing over your current level in a specific profession. Suggestions are based on the leveling guides posted on the official US forums (credit goes to their respective authors). The addon also suggests you where to quest/grind xp depending on your character level. Suggestions were also added for the most recent factions. More to come later.<br />
Auction house: You can see which auctions/bids you've placed with an alt without being logged in or being at the AH.<br />
Professions: You can browse all known recipes in a thotbot like frame (see screenshot).<br />
Mounts &amp; Pets of all your alts.<br />
Achievements are tracked for all you alts (see screenshot).<br />
Guild Members: a list of your connected guildmates, along with their alts (if they're using Altoholic too), and their average item level. Clicking their AiL will also allow you to &quot;remotely&quot; inspect their equipment.<br />
Guild Skills: a list of altoholic users in your guild, along with their alts and direct profession links. All professions are available in one click.<br />
Guild Bank tabs: a list of altoholic users and the time at which they last visited the guild bank. If you haven't visited the guild bank for a few days, you can remotely update your local data without going to a capital city.<br />
<br />

Blue posts<br />
Big Love Rocket Droprate<br />
The drop rate for this mount is indeed lower than 1-2% and that is intentional. We are okay with the number it is at right now and will continue to see how things for this event. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23214152934-big-love-rocket-drop-rate-bug.html))<br />
<br />
Sticking with the same role<br />
I'm not entirely sure what the goal of this thread was, but World of Warcraft is a game with a variety of play styles that are there for players to play and experience as they see fit. Just because you started out as a healer (or whatever else) doesn't mean you need to stay that way forever. It is hard to really argue that doing the same exact thing for 5+ years won't be taxing in some way.<br />
<br />
I know some people who love healing and in the situations where they end up DPSing (like when dropping down to two healers in a raid or something) they complain a bit that they don't have as much impact on the raid. There are also the healer types that have nothing but healing specs since they want the responsibility of taking care of the raid and don't want to put that in someone else's hands (these people also tend to get especially irritated when these other healers are causing problems that they wouldn't have done themselves). Then some others may end up being &quot;forced&quot; to heal a fair amount to help out the group and any good guild I've been with tries to prevent the situation where that one person ends up carrying the load week in and week out with no end in sight.<br />
<br />
What I'm getting at here is just to remind players that if you aren't in the mood to do something anymore, try out something else. Whether that's Battlegrounds or a hunter or changing to that other spec you haven't had a chance to try out yet, give it a try and see how it goes. You may find a new style to play for the next few years or you may end up being good buddies again with your original play style.

New Wallpaper: For the Horde!<br />
Blizzard has just added a new wallpaper to the World of Warcraft Wallpaper Gallery (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/wallpapers.html) featuring some sporty scenes of snowboarding in the Storm Peaks. Take a moment to check out this snowboarding orc (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/wallpapers/wallpaper174.html) in action! <br />

<br />
Best part is that if you have multiple accounts (like I do) that you can enable a sharing feature and see all the same info on both accounts from either one. This really helps cut down on the swapping back and forth and login spam.<br />

Altoholic alerts tradeskill cooldowns too. Well, it does it for me. I can track my Warrior's transmutes, my Mage's cloth, and my Paladin's titansteel.<br />

Because gear isn't every one's reason to play WoW ? It sure ain't my reason.<br />

I think he said a while back he uses another char for main raiding as he was getting spammed from people reading the website, making lvl 1's and asking him questions all the time.<br />
<br />
Also - if your not playing for gear in this game, what do you play for? <br />
It can't be to see everywhere as you need the gear to see the latest places... Social interaction is ok i guess, but msn / facebook do it better... Heroics if your anything but super casual are a 1x daily boring grind for your 2 frost marks and professions are that weak they are kinda pointless with each proff having 2 - 4 items that sell at any sorta speed for it to be interesting. I'm not bashing the game as i like it, but i find people who say they dont play to make their char better very confusing</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play the game to have fun. I don't enjoy raiding too much and I find it boring.<br />
One of the things I do for example, is BGs. BGs currently are only there for those who enjoy it, since you can get way better gear from other location.<br />
So if I took a screen from my PvP character, if would also just show ilvl 213 gear, yet I have fun with it.<br />
Another example is my hunter which I collect minipet with (currently 72) and it's Salty title ... yes, some people do enjoy fishing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Level 10x 80. Gain about 8-9k gold from quests while doing so = profit. (altho takes a long time, and don't buy gear/epic flying.)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainCZ</div><div class="date">2010-02-17, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Altoholic is amazing but eats toooooooooooo much memory</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Then why'd he just make a post listing all of his alts? And Boub is clearly his main by the amount of playing time listed. And why would you have an 80 of every class on one server and have your main on a different server? Highly unlikely. <br />

Actually, now that I look at it, his DK has better gear than his hunter, but it's still not great gear.<br />
<br />
Anyway, IF he said that, he probably just said that to keep people off his back.</div></div><hr />

Yes he has a lot of gold but I currently have a little over 100k gold, and reason behind that is there isn't any money sink and its just SOOOO easy to make gold on this game, if you don't have 5-10k right now you aren't even making a very small effort. Hint: Alchemy.... that’s all I am going to say.<br />
<br />
Also I can believe if Boub has another alt because of everyone that could be messaging him ALL the time. I would have to have a separate character to play on if I had this web site just to stay away from troll's...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rogel</div><div class="date">2010-02-17, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then why'd he just make a post listing all of his alts? And Boub is clearly his main by the amount of playing time listed. And why would you have an 80 of every class on one server and have your main on a different server? Highly unlikely. <br />

<br />
<br />
It does support this and can even pop up messages in your chat frame warning you that icy prism, CD cloths, alchemy research and pretty much anything else are about to become available.<br />
<br />
Been using it myself for almost a year now and its an indispensable tool in my eyes.</div></div><hr />

I chuckled. This is a pretty solid addon, btw.</div></div><hr />

However, I would encourage anyone who likes it to check out Armory (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/armory.aspx) - I like the interface a little more, as it mimics the character pane as it appears in game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">danmart1</div><div class="date">2010-02-17, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This addon is great. It sure beats going throgh every rying to find my eternals. Plus knowing the rest xp on low level alts is helpful. The one issue I have is that the interface feels clunky, just a little bit though. Not enough for me to not recommend this to everyone with more than 2 or 3 alts. Again, great addon.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funkyfloyd</div><div class="date">2010-02-17, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just wanted to say ive been using altoholic for months now and its been a life saver.<br />
<br />
however, the worst part about it is it has a horrible profession search.<br />
truly horrible.<br />
<br />
for example. for enchanting the drop down lists 'enchanting' 'created' etc to sort. which is a horrible way to try to find a listing for say all wrist enchants. <br />
<br />
one would think the drop down to sort would be identical as it would be in the actual profession window. which is odd because JC does have the correct sort options in its drop down in altoholic.</div></div><hr />

I used to bounce around off and online and people thought I was being hacked. Now I just open the addon and see what its my inventory or what quests I have, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, Thanks for this. I had no idea such an add-on was even available, and im the kind of person that logs on all characters just to find one precious item. This will save me a colossal amount of time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jackdemenzes</div><div class="date">2010-02-17, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've used Altoholic for ages and loved it.<br />
<br />
It came in really handy when I was hacked actually, I had a complete list of all my character inventories based on when I last logged out...though it does lack an export feature, had to go digging around in DataStore_Containers.lua for awhile, but the info is there if you need it.<br />
Though I realised later that rather than staring at .lua code for ages, it would've been better to install Altoholic on a friends machine, copy that .lua file over, then ask them to log in long enough for you to copy the info out.<br />
<br />
Eh, anyway, but it *is* fantastic!</div></div><hr />

I've been using altoholic for over a year now, it hands down beats any other similar addon I've tried.</div></div><hr />

It's not nearly as robust, but worth noting that you can get a lot of this functionality with a combination of ArkInventory and Ara_Broker_Tradeskills with, I imagine, a lot less memory overhead.</div></div><hr />

Not exactly sure how old is old too you, but my system is over 5 years old and I run it with no problems.</div></div><hr />
