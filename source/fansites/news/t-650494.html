Europe - Cross-Language Battlegroups are here!<br />
If you can't remember where your server is, check the Battlegroups page (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/battlegroups.html) on the official site! <br />
After successful testing on the PTR, we are pleased to announce that the first Cross-Language Battlegroups were created last Wednesday. This new feature combines Battlegroups from different languages into one, expanding the pool of players keen for PvP action in both Arenas and Battlegrounds. We plan to proceed with the next batch of Cross-Language Battlegroups on Wednesday, June 3rd during the weekly maintenance.<br />
<br />
Players from realms of different languages will only ever face each other as opponents in battle and will not be playing on the same faction in Battlegrounds, ensuring that those playing on your side will speak the same language as you.<br />
<br />
Please note that not all Battlegroups will be joined into Cross-Language Battlegroups, and this feature will not be affecting the Russian language Battlegroups. Please see below for a full list.<br />

Gaining XP in battlegrounds<br />
It's something we're very interested in doing. I'm confident you'll find out more soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367882158-4-years-now-and-you-still-cant-level-thru-pvp.html))<br />
<br />
Mount Skills<br />
We're looking at the whole mount and skill system currently. We may make some changes in the near future, but I doubt that making mount skills account wide will be one of them. Still, we agree that some changes may need to be made. We will have more information on this in the future. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367882242-epic-flight.html))<br />
<br />
Badge System<br />
We have some new things in store for the badge system to help with the current end game progression curve that exists (as you noted: Heroics &gt; Naxx &gt; Ulduar &gt; 3.2 &gt; Icecrown ). We're looking to put together this information for you and will provide it as soon as it's ready to go. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367881984-valor-difficulty-5-mans.html))<br />
<br />
New PvE Gear in the Coliseum<br />
In patch 3.2 the coliseum will hold new 5, 10, and 25 player challenges, so gear has to come with that especially since Arena Season 7 will start and we can't introduce new PvP gear without PvE gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/17367881473-ironboundrusted-protodrake.html))<br />
<br />
Arena representation and game balance<br />
There is a correlation between representation and balance, but it's not 1.0. Certain classes are more popular than others because players like the idea of that class or the play style. Certain classes are in low representation because they are countered by others who are higher. Certain classes maintain a high representation just because they counter other classes that are high.<br />
<br />
It also matters how you measure representation. Are you comparing Arena representation to representation of the class at level 80 overall? Are you looking at all brackets or just 2s? Are you looking at all Arena teams, just the high ranking ones, or just the top 100? Or top 10? Those all give you different answers.<br />
<br />
Some classes require more player skill than others. What you see in a situation like this is that among lower ratings, the class isn't effective because some of those players lack the requisite skill. Then you see at very high ratings, the class comes into play again because in the hands of an expert it's deadly. Does this mean the class is unbalanced because only experts can make it work or balanced because at the highest echelons where skill matters the most, it is in equal representation?<br />
<br />
As the OP points out, being able to hard counter someone in very strict rock-paper-scissors style may be balanced but it's not fun. We don't actually go out of our way to make sure X is a class that beats Y. Certain classes will have advantages over the others just because of the way the class mechanics work out. We're okay with that to a point because it keeps things interesting, but we don't want you to feel you've lost when the doors open and you see who is on the other side. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367811581-representation--balance.html))<br />
<br />
Giving a Mortal Strike debuff to casters<br />
It's an interesting question that comes up a lot. Would caster comps be more viable if they just brought MS? Would things feel more even if MS was a 20% debuff instead of 50%?<br />
<br />
One of the things we've noticed from feedback is that players who feel like they just can't stop healers often lack MS on their team. On the other hand, teams that feel like they get clobbered be melee nearly always have the MS debuff on them.<br />
<br />
We experimented with giving the debuff to shamans early on Lich King, but ended up backing off of that because it just felt like we were homogenizing classes too much. But you can make the argument that it's such a game changer that it's almost mandatory in Arena.

Bugs with rage generation? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367760070-newly-discovered-rage-ghost-nerf-unveiled.html))<br />
We investigated this issue and found it was not true – the rage generation formula has not changed anytime recently. So we looked into it further to figure out why this was being brought up and here are some of the problems we came across:<br />
<br />
In the formulas people are using, there is a constant value which is labeled as ‘c’. At some point in the past, someone calculated a formula for determining c based on their level and that formula is not correct past level 70 as this value needs retuning from time to time like when a new expansion comes out. The value listed for c is 320.6 when it is actually 453.3.<br />
<br />
We modified the system for displaying power bars in Wrath of the Lich King to have the client display its best guess of how much power they have, which is very deterministic for mana or energy, but not so much for rage. This most likely results in the displayed rage being off slightly at times, making the data collection more difficult. The client displays its best guess and the server validates the power usage against the value it knows they actually have - the two can be out of synch occasionally which throws the data off.<br />
<br />
Some of the testing was done with ungeared characters hitting for very small amounts. There is a component to the calculation we haven’t previously mentioned that will make the rage gained from those attacks sometimes not match the formula. Basically, the normal formula is Rage = (7.5d/c+f*s)/2. However, that result can never be larger than (7.5d/c)*2. This essentially means that very low damage attacks have a limit on how much they can be averaged up by the f*s component of the equation.<br />
<br />
To try and clarify things for the number crunchers, conceptually, here is the formula for rage generation:<br />
<br />
1) Determine rage based on damage done divided by a level constant (7.5*d/c)<br />
2) Determine how much rage would be 3.5 rage per second when factoring in the hit made and the weapon’s speed (f*s)<br />
3) Average the two of them together (the divided by 2 part).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't really say that... 2s are something anyone can organize to play at any time.. It takes just you and your partner, unlike 5v5 where it takes you and 4 more people who would have to be free at the same time every day to play daily... Not to mention it needs to be some sort of a balanced 5 men group...<br />
<br />
This is why EVERY (almost every) character who does arenas has a 2v2, but not everyone have a 3v3 and even less a 5v5...<br />
To force a class to play a 5v5 to say it is just as good as other classes in arenas, and for it to be represented in nearly same numbers as other classes, is a little unfair...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would interpret it like they think about to change all the colour from warlock's fire-spells (Shadowflame, Incinerate, Immolate, Conflagrate...) to a green one. Like the Chaos Bolt-green or so. <br />
As a contrast to the 'normal' fire from the mages and to underline the demonic power in them. <br />

QFT<br />
<br />
Mount Skills<br />
Some reasonable solution would be to make riding skill like 50% cheaper for alts (on the same server). Totally free would be too much.<br />
<br />
Coliseum<br />
I am not really sure of my opinion towards that new party/raid instance. If it's just some &quot;small&quot; Arena where you fight the bosses one after another, it wouldn't justify a whole new tier of gear in the term of an epic challenge.<br />
What i would really like, would be something like a huuuge Coliseum, where you not only fight in the arena but have to fight your way through the &quot;backstage&quot; areas and such - like Thorim but a lot bigger.<br />
<br />
Mortal Strike<br />
I don't really do PvP, but reducing Mortal Strike (and similar effects) from 50% to 20% would require a lot of changing in the other parts of the affected classes. A warrior with only 20% MS wouldn't be viable anymore without otherwise compensation. But taking it slowly and reducing it only to like 40%, and look how it plays out, could work. Or the other way round, adding small MS effects to abilities (e.g. Mangle debuff or Vampiric Touch -20% healing. These are just examples... where and how an MS could be added remains subject of further research)<br />
<br />
Green Fire for Warlocks<br />
I like that idea! It might take some time to get used to it, but i would encourage that change.<br />
<br />
Rage Formula<br />
If there is a bug or not, the fact that blizzard starts to come out with the exact formulas for game mechanics (like they did with armor penetration) is very welcome. A lot of formulas are already known through testing, but official proof is always a good idea.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JUNOX1</div><div class="date">2009-05-30, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">MS to casters do sound kinda silly.(stabs warrior with hes wand and the infection reduces 50% healing) :o<br />
<br />
but yea its true some classes cant be killed without having healing reduction on them. (disc,resto druid) i currently have two 2v2 teams 1 is lock/mage the other rogue/DK. as a mage its pretty hard to burst down a disc priest with pain supress and penance since my lock partner is 90% of the time first 1 to get targeted.<br />
<br />
sadly my rogue is in blues and junk and he does way better. since druids cant run do to the constant cripling and wound and disc penance becomes a lil easyer 2 kick with mindnumbing.<br />
<br />
teams that feel like they get clobbered be melee nearly always have the MS debuff on them. <br />
like they sayd rock paper scissors. that might cause the only 1s that can stop you are the classes with ms since you probably dont notice the ones your rollover.<br />
<br />
Instead of MS give all casters Manaburn i wanna give them priests some payback</div></div><hr />

&quot;Twinks are people staying back a grade to be better bullies in the playground.&quot;<br />

<br />
This. I hated twinks so bad when I was leveling all of my toons.<br />
<br />
Seems like they are taking those drakes out a bit early too.<br />

Seriously, learn that not everyone plays their class or spec because it's the new FotM, and that some of us DO genuinly enjoy playing that class or spec.<br />
<br />
<br />
You didn't understand what he meant. Sure there are a lot of people who genuinely like their class, may it be lore or play style, but the &quot;FotM&quot; concept has been affecting class numbers a great deal since the introduction of arenas.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nathanyel</div><div class="date">2009-05-30, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't go as far as saying;<br />
&quot;People play classes that are good/op not because its fun. Remember back in the day Warlock's were awful and useless. Did you see many of them? Nope.&quot;<br />
<br />
Simply because it's not that simple and that's a very gross generalisation, and quite insulting to people who do play the class or spec because they enjoy it as opposed to how well it does in certain situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Erm... Druids. Compare Vanilla numbers to nowadays. Sure, you can say the class became a lot more attractive, but you can also explain this increase by the Resto OPness during BC, I think Balance was OP at some point, too, and in WotLK we've seen nerfs of Feral's burstiness already, plus the general better raid viability of all 4 PvE specs. <br />
<br />
To me, one major sign that a large number of those new players is not really dedicated to the druid class is the rise of the so-called nickname &quot;dudu&quot; in the German community since mid-BC. As far as I and other long-term druid players know, it was an insult at some point, an abbreviation meaning &quot;dumb durid&quot; (aaand... another thing, so I heard) to mock the players' interest in a weak class or whatever. It is my speculation that, sure not the majority, but a certain number of the players who rerolled druid &quot;because it's cool now&quot; used to call druids like that back then, and then continued to address their own new class that way, (deliberately) forgetting the original meaning, and introduced this term to other new and unknowing druid players, who accepted it as a &quot;cute&quot; nickname. This then crept back to the other classes, who started to use the term, too.<br />
Now, whenever someone complains about the widespread use of the term, because of the original meaning or just because it sounds like baby language, the contradicting replies usually come down to &quot;I like it lol&quot; and &quot;I call you like I want you effing dudu&quot; - yes, the latter posted with level 80 druid avatars.</div></div><hr />

That's a valid assumption but still only an assumption. Although it did occur to me the drakes could simply be &quot;upgraded&quot; to the new instance instead of them creating a new set of non-heroic and heroic mount rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't twink anymore but i used too and i enjoyed it immensly. Most people twink because while they may have a lvl 80 that they pvp with, using that lvl 80 over and over again is boring. So instead of leveling another character to 80 and sitting through terrible bgs at 80 you level a character a short amount and gear him out and pvp with him. Its simply an easy fun way to pvp with a different class. As for the whole &quot;twinks are just bullys because they have way better gear&quot; recent nerfs to enchants really reduced alot of twink stats. Sure a twink will be better against a kid in white/green gear its not different from lvl 80 bgs? Me and my arena partner do alot of bgs with each other, me pocket healing him. We have a mix of furious/deadly gear and to be honest its not even fair most of the time. Im not trying to sound like im bragging, but a 19 twink vs a 18 non twink is about the same as me and my partner against 3-4 allies in green leveling gear in a level 80 bg.<br />
<br />
I hope i shed some light onto why people twink without looking like a total ass. When i was on my twink it was no fun to kill low levels if anything it was more fun to fight with other twinks. Sure there are the kids that twink just for the satisfaction of killing lowbies but dont judge the twinking community by a bunch of asshats that say &quot;non twinks need to L2P etc etc&quot;</div></div><hr />

Actually if you knew anything about twinking you'd know that twinks would prefer to fight twinks. People don't just twink to roll people casually leveling up and doing a BG once in a while. <br />

If you're a twink, yes.<br />
<br />
If the claim that twinks prefer to fight other twinks is true, then having their own BG to fight in would solve a lot of problems, wouldn't it?

Isn't OS before Naxx in terms of progression or I'm missing something? And screw that new PVE season system that they regurgitate from their arena system.

<br />
If that claim is true. Just like hardly anyone would play on a &quot;Classic Server&quot; for longer than a few weeks, about 95% of the twinks would continue to pwn normal BGs unless there was XP through kills/objectives. And I don't think Blizzard would implement a separate form of BGs just for a group of mostly stereotype-came-to-life &quot;kiddies&quot; to continue their niche of nonintended usage of the game.</div></div><hr />
