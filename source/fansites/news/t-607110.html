No. Seal of the Crusader will still increase your attack speed and will still nerf your damage done with other attacks than Crusader Strike. It's still a useless seal, it just won't nerf the shit out of you if you activate it too early in order to reapply Judgement of the Crusader (which is an entirely different spell)</div></div><hr />

And exactly how many of those Druids are Feral Specc'd?<br />
Rather than Resto, who use Shapeshifting as nothing more than a way of escaping, and who's contribution to their team principally revolves around humanoid form?<br />
<br />
It is a big hit to feral druid versatility vs hunters, while doing very little to bother Resto or Boomkin.<br />
<br />
Why is there no reciprocal instant Hibernate?<br />
Or an instant Turn Evil for palas for that matter?<br />
It's not like either of these have any impact vs a player directly, just their pets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
first of all, hunters are not OP, there are so many things working against hunters its amazing. secondly, it is consistent with blizzard's strategy to try to equalize the distance between overrepresented classes and underrepresented classes in arena. you may say, &quot;hunters are in low numbers at higher tiers b/c most hunters suck.&quot; well, to this i respond that most druids are in higher tiered arenas not because of their skill, but because the druid class is the easiest to be dominant with in arena (read: this &quot;buff&quot; will only expose those of you who suck). thus the direct nerf to druids and buff to hunters. besides, our cd is 30 seconds, so really, quit your crying.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rav</div><div class="date">2008-04-25, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the range boost on scare beast is a good change, though instant cast might be a bit much. <br />
<br />
agree though this hurts ferals even more, here is what I would do<br />
----<br />
Cat Form Shapeshift <br />
35% of base Mana<br />
Instant cast <br />
Shapeshift into cat form, increasing melee attack power by 40 plus Agility. Also protects the caster from Polymorph and Scare Beast effects and allows the use of various cat abilities.<br />
<br />
The act of shapeshifting frees the caster of Polymorph and Movement Impairing effects. <br />
----<br />
<br />
Ever see a resto druid go cat form other than to prowl? <br />
<br />
Could do something similar for Moonkinform, though at least balance can go caster form and still do some dps. Feral druid cant do that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kor0su</div><div class="date">2008-04-25, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point of this, is now this ability goes from being completely worthless, to worth having on the bar. Like Cobrakai said, if this &quot;totally counters you&quot; then you suck and were leaching off the tit the druid bandwagon, although if this change leads to many crushing defeats in arena for you, i can't imagine you have won many arena games in the first place. <br />
<br />
Lets take the facts into consideration. this is a 30 second cooldown, and a 30 yard range, still entirely kitable, all this means is druids might have to pay attention instead of throwing a few hots up and then just running around in bear, you might actually have to be conscious of where you're running/kiting and when to try to interrupt with bear charge. <br />
<br />
Granted it makes it hard to prevent an instant cast spell, but I have no sympathy for druids there either having their spell book packed with instant cast spells and abilities.<br />
<br />
All in all these outcries of injustice are pretty much people just whining that a skill that has been pretty much useless throughout the entire game and now it can be used against them and they feel slighted like they should have been given something in return to allow them to counter this new OP once every 30 second threat to their dominance.<br />
<br />
And enough about ferals, they whine because they're underpowered in arenas, I think the real problem is that they go from being so set as resto in pvp, that when they switch to feral and find out they might have to try harder to do something, they feel it's because they're gimped. I've seen plenty of feral people (granted not many in arena) that do plenty of damage. I will admit i don't have much experience with ferals in pvp through personal use, and i'm sure there are some drawbacks to the spec, but i do feel that the situation is probably not nearly as bad as they say.<br />
<br />
This is blizz, i'd be willing to bet they either add the cast timer back on or reduce the duration or something, now that the ability is going to actually be used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
God damm Blizz! They should change feral forms type to &quot;shapeshifter&quot; and not &quot;beast&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yea. As a feral druid, this will be just like facing a warlock, a simply impossible win. Funny that 2 patches ago hunters were one of the classes we did well vs.<br />
<br />
This one will hurt. I cannot remember the last WSG I was in that didn't have 4 NE hunters.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">frankie</div><div class="date">2008-04-25, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ummm I don't really care any longer because I stopped playing a few weeks ago, but to be honest, the druid nerfs are a getting out of hand.<br />
<br />
First, there's the speed reduction from 161% to 140% in cheetah form. That doesn't just mean you've lost one third of your speed bonus and as such will take 1 1/3 times as many hits / as much damage from melees before you can escape. These missing 21% mean that a warrior can hamstring you one more time so you've got to shift one more time and need like 3-5 seconds more to fully escape. And that's when his super-long intercept cooldown kicks in :P<br />
I didn't play for too long in patch 2.4, but from what I've seen, it takes way, way longer to escape from warriors and rogues.<br />
<br />
Second, there's the range reduction of cyclone from 30 to 20 yard, meaning you've got to expose yourself in order to cast a cyclone. Pretty dangerous to do so since travel form is way slower than before. Those two changes got some kind of an anti-synergy bonus :o<br />
<br />
Third, the change to natural perfection means Druids lose a 4% up to 12% dmg reduction talent against melee classes (given the scenario that you're receiving damage from melees only). <br />
<br />
So, in total, druids have to get closer to a warrior to cyclone him, have a way harder time escaping from him and receive a noticable amount of additional damage while trying to escape. Great. And now hunters get a 30 yard instant fear on a 30 second cooldown. Makes me not wanna come back to WoW really :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, Class vs. Race is not the same as Class vs. Certain Spec Class, but is quite like &quot;the same&quot; just more specific.<br />
<br />
At the same time, both Hunter and Druid share the same &quot;nature allegiance&quot; which in game term means, that neither of the class should be an &quot;anti class&quot; of the other!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
you've missed my point entirely. <br />
<br />
if this buff means that you will now lose all your games, yes, you do suck. i'm sorry, but now you're going to learn to eat fears from classes just like the rest of us do. while this might mean doing something different from your druid rollface strat, im sure a smart player like yourself can work around it.<br />
<br />

also, bliz has stated that not every spec will be viable for arena. the reason you dont see many BM hunters qq'ing that they dont want to spec MM for breaking that 2200 mark is b/c they realize you cant do everything with every spec. same to you ferals out there - get used to going resto, cause thats what bliz sees your arena future at.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, Class vs. Race is not the same as Class vs. Certain Spec Class, but is quite like &quot;the same&quot; just more specific.<br />
<br />
At the same time, both Hunter and Druid share the same &quot;nature allegiance&quot; which in game term means, that neither of the class should be an &quot;anti class&quot; of the other! <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Why the hell would you run behind a pillar if you're feral specc'd? You want to be in melee range to deal damage. As it stands at the moment vs hunters, you have to be pretty switched off to miss a scare beast cast, and rightly deserve the spanking you get while feared.<br />
<br />
IF this change was inteded to address the druid imbalance in arenas I can't see it being successful at all as most of the druids playing arenas are resto specc'd and don't rely on their shapeshifting for anything other than escaping. And while doing so are shifting from one form to another repeatedly, giving the hunters a very small window (with lag) to hit them in beast form.<br />
<br />
It will hurt feral druids the most, and lets not beat around the bush, they sit next to the prot wars and shadow priests in arena viability as it stands at the moment. Sure with a really good player, they can be successful (I don't want to hear about &quot;your&quot; feral druid in the 2.2k band as &quot;proof&quot; that ferals are great for PvP), but they are not the reason for the Druid arena imbalance.</div></div><hr />

if this buff means that you will now lose all your games, yes, you do suck. i'm sorry, but now you're going to learn to eat fears from classes just like the rest of us do. while this might mean doing something different from your druid rollface strat, im sure a smart player like yourself can work around it.<br />

<br />
yet all 3 specs of a hunter are in general the same, range dps bla bla...<br />
but a druid has a healing tree a caster tree and a melee tree, quite not the same, therefor if a class should have the right to be able to play with any spec in arena n be able to compete with all the rest, this class would have been druids/shamans n paladins since their 3 specs differ from each other.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, most ppl cant see this and they are only thinking that all druids play a resto, no we are not all playing restos and this is a deadly change for ferals against hunters. Ferals are already gimped for arena and haven't yet seen a change that will make em atleast able to compete somehow.<br />
<br />
p.s. am a feral and yes i used to play arena, stoped after getting my s3 staff as a feral seing that the effort i had to do for getting that was way more it should have been. I can't see many ferals getting s4 weapon with the new ratings, and for those who will, hat off, (i will definetly not go for it, the effort i have to pay for that is not worth it)<br />

wrong.<br />
<br />
ask any top rated hunter - hunters, while a damage dealing class, have a role in arenas centered around crowd control, interrupts, and mana draining. we dont just pew pew like we would if we were raiding. as such, the vast majority of 2000+ rated hunters are a variation of the MM tree (either MM/Surv or tri-spec). <br />
<br />
i for one dont think that the entire talent trees of every class should be built around equal arena viability. some specs are suited for pve, others for pve. it would literally be impossible to balance every spec in every class for BOTH pve and pvp and have EVERYONE satisfied. deal with it.</div></div><hr />

You really don't get what the other poster was saying... which is just plain sad.<br />
Hunters are essentially the same, it doesn't matter what spec you play, for the purposes of arena.<br />
Guess why?<br />
Because you get one set of gear for all three talent trees.<br />
Yeah, I know this is really hard to understand, but stick with me.<br />
Feral gets one set of gear, it is high in armor content and str. agi.<br />
Moonkin gets a DIFFERENT set of gear, one that focuses on (I know, this is probably hard for you to understand) spell damage.<br />
Resto gets a third set of gear, different from the other two... focusing on, you guessed it, healing.<br />
<br />
No matter what spec a huntard plays, the gear you will be earning is the same.<br />
How is this a hard concept to wrap your brain around?<br />
Oh yeah, huntard.<br />
And any huntard who needed a buff against a feral druid in arena is so massively fail at WoW that I doubt they are able to dress themselves IRL.</div></div><hr />

all you L2Play. lmao. insta-cast 30 yard range, lasts 20 (10) seconds with 30 sec recharge? exactly what is our counter to it? take it and like it while waiting for diminishing returns to finally kick in? at least when it had a cast time, a good druid would pay attention and when a hunter started casting, shift out of beast form.<br />

last time i checked sk-gaming it was about 40% druid 2on2 teams above 2,2k in the world. and this 40% were just 3 setups: druid + warri/lock/rogue<br />
<br />
but youre right, there wasnt really a point in buffing scare beast. it was a good tool to force druids to humanoid form anyway. 30 yards and instant is a buff for hunters and there was no need to buff a class thats already strong enoungh.<br />
but still there is a 30sek cooldown, and it wont effect resto druids as much as ferals.<br />
<br />
now you guys will say: thats exactly the point! ferals are sooooo bad in arena!<br />
<br />
just have a look, how many of these specs do you see playing arena:<br />
prot pallies, prot warrior, holy priest (the circle type), destro lock, survival hunter and so on<br />
<br />
there are some specs that are just not as strong as other specs and there are still some really good players out there playing arena, and playing 2on2 highrated with specs that arent nearly as strong as other specs for there class. just get used to it or discuss with the rest of the world about how imbalanced some specs in 2on2 are. but for gods sake do it where no one else has to listen.<br />
the whole &quot;im pve specced i cant pvp!&quot; discussion is older then arena, please just stop. practice, and kick some buts. there are ferals out there playing highrated. watch there movies, practice more and you might succeed.<br />
<br />
again: youre right, there was no need for this buff. scare beast was useful before, now its a strong tool against druids. but remember, its still one skill and only strong against one class. whatever class youre playing with, there are ways to counter it.<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
druid/warri has found a strong combo which they couldnt just crush in a half like they do with nearly every other combo, congratulations! youll still beat 2343245 combos in no time and youre not a freewin, stop complaining.<br />
druid/lock, you can fear the other druid no matter what form hes in (without 30sek cd) and guess what, you also can dispell scare beast ;)<br />
druid/rogue, your opponent has a tool to escape from youre rogue but you still can counter traps and dmg better then all combos out there.<br />
<br />
its a buff, against one class, fav combinations with that class are still not just free points. and a specific spec is complaining, come out of your corners prot pallies!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
see you guys<br />
<br />
and yes, i play a hunter and i play with a priest, not a druid, but i play my druid more and my pally the most ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
/edit that gear argument 2 posts above is just godlike. thats youre argument for not being resto? well, get that blue set for 100g, spent 50k honor, grab a warrior, play for 2k as resto in crap gear, get youre feral shoulders for a spec thats not so good for pvp.<br />

Hey Ghorak, <br />
Learn to read, smart ass. That post two above yours was in response to another post referencing a post before that.<br />
The huntard did not understand the point the previous poster made, much like you completely missed mine with your sub-mediocre reading / comprehension skills.<br />
<br />
Also: ROFL @ Rubin. <br />
Yes, let blizzard take back the MS ability on Aimed Shot and we will see just how little hunters care... <br />
But keep at it, maybe someday you will be able to understand what you read, and that threads have a certain level of continuity to them at times.<br />
<br />
Your example of poor prot pallys gear not being available through pvp in regards to feral tanking shows your lack of knowledge for tanking in general.</div></div><hr />

you alone made this post about gear, while saijeh wasnt referring to gear in any way.<br />
lets take the tournament realm, saijehs post would be the same and you wouldnt even had posted your whole &quot;huntard&quot; crap because gear doesnt matter with premade chars.<br />

btw i never mentioned any word about feral &quot;tanking&quot; gear, i was only referring to gear for every spec the paladin has. druids atleast can get descent feral gear pretty easy when they just go resto, while there isnt prot gear for warrior or paladin.<br />

I'm not really sure at all what this is supposed to mean, but the MS Aimed shot is useless and most high end hunters don't even attach a hot key to it. Heck I have a hot key for counterattack even, but aimed shot is a worthless waste of casting time.</div></div><hr />

It's definitely a very powerful change, on one side I'm pretty happy since I'm going to play with a hunter for s4, this is a serious buff to any 2s or 3s with a hunter since there's so much druids; on the other side, playing a druid myself, I think the change is a bit overpowered, too much anti-druid, changing range is fine, but making it insta-cast.. scare beast will be the only cc with a cooldown under a minute that will be insta cast.<br />
Also who cares about feral, blizzard should make balance tree a more viable arena build first, if you want to play feral, go pve or reroll a rogue, no, not all specs need to be good in arena, do you see protection paladins or warrior asking for a arena buff?<br />
As for hunters in general they are neither weak nor overpowered, statistics are mostly crap to look at class balance, and even if you could argue about 2s and 3s (which is more about the right setup to play against anyway), if you think hunters are weak in 5s then you need to L2P.<br />
<br />
Anyway if they change scare beast, they should definitely change paladin's turn evil and make it insta-cast too, because right now this spell is almost useless since counterspelling turn evil end out the same as counterspelling the next heal.<br />
All in all about classes balance, druids don't need any more real nerf, else, 2s would then be dominated by double dps or priest teams, and 3s by RMP. What they need to do though, is slightly buff shamans and paladins for 2s and 3s, and a slight overall rogue nerf, because rogue control+dps+survivability=imba right now, but that's just me, because I hate that fricking class and their lame grief inducing gameplay.</div></div><hr />

WOOOOW thanks for opening my eyes with you retarded argument.<br />
<br />
i understood it completely when i posted and my point still stands. you think that just b/c bliz provides diff types of gear that you're entitled to have every spec viable in arena? again, the fact that diff spec gears exist doesn't change whether bliz cares that you want to spec feral for arena. i'm sorry if you cant understand this very simple simple point. just because i have one set of gear available to my hunter, doesn't mean that all three specs are just as viable given my ROLE in an arena match. LIKEWISE, just because druids have 3 sets of gear doesn't mean bliz cares about changing what has evolved as the primary ROLE of druids in arena. all they care about is balancing class representation, not the specs those classes use. <br />
<br />

It won't ever be the difference maker in a fight, nor do hunters use aimed shot in small arenas in most cases. It is a useless &quot;buff&quot; that wasn't thought out and although hunters needed a buff, this was not the right decision to make. It doesn't fit in with the class and did little to solve the essential problems that hunters have in arena.</div></div><hr />

Get your head around this:<br />
Beastmaster, Marksman, Survival: different specs<br />
Balance, Feral, Restoration: different classes (=playstyles)<br />
<br />
Each druid &quot;spec&quot; is not just a different way to deal dmg or different CC/escape/utility skills, it's a completely different gameplay style.<br />
Of course, every druid is free to re-spec at any time, esp. restos often respec to level/farm (not much experience with the farm spec needed for that), but in the end, you stick to one talent tree, and spend most of your time playing exactly that &quot;spec&quot;, whether PvE or PvP, and have the most experience there. Telling a Moonkin or Feral to respec Resto just to be able to pvp is like telling a mage or rogue to reroll priest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Did you actually notice, anywhere in this thread a feral druid asking for a buff?<br />
Perhaps you should take some time and read again.<br />
<br />
The issue is, in response to a tremendous PvP imbalance that sees druids unfairly represented in all Arena brackets, Blizzard seem to have enacted a balancing change that will in all probability hardly impact the specific spec (resto) causing that imbalance at all. While it will completely change the dynamic between hunters and a completely different spec (feral), which is one of the less favourable arena specs.<br />
<br />
It is comparable to giving Mages an instant cast, 30 yard range (30 sec CD) fear that only works vs humanoids in Shadow form, because Disc/Holy priests are over represented in PvP.<br />
(though this is obviously an extreme example for illustrative purposes only)</div></div><hr />

&quot;Scare Beast: The range on this spell has been increased to 30 yards and it is now instant cast.&quot; <br />
and then comes the growl nerf because charge was bugged (fixing charge wasnt enough , growl needed a nerf ) ~~<br />
1 completly retarded and not needed nerf and INSANE buff ..like hunters would need it ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you look at the numbers lately? Hunters indeed needed a buff. Do only COMPLETE retards post here lately? Is this the 10year-old-cry-forum or what?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although i do actualy disagree about it beeing a instant cast fear spell.<br />
At least each fear (not horrifying effect) has a casting time, to make it interruptable.<br />
Although that wouldnt be fear against the CD on it.<br />
<br />
So id say yust life with it druids (rerolled druid as well here!)<br />
Still, at the end, skills will decide the outcome of a arena match (with a little help from gear).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The buffs hunters were given before, dispelling arcane shot and MS Aimed shot can be taken back for all any hunter cares. They are useless. This buff actually takes a small step toward addressing the problem.<br />
<br />
On the topic of shamans, I think they're doing better with the changes to ghost wolf, you'll just have to give that change some time to start showing in the numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're ridiculous if you think hunters have it bad. Given the fact that they completely take a shit on mages and priests (hi viper sting and arcane shot!) - well at least dwarf priests can last longer... and are starting to become the new fotm of 2v2 via the form of healer + hunter... are you still sure you wanna say that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The only reason why hunter numbers are down is because 90% are keyboard turning clickers that can't play worth shit. It's one of the classes that people play ez-mode in battlegrounds because there isn't any LoS collision and they hop into arenas thinking they're just gonna stand there shooting at things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many ppl just said, spend 100g farm 50k honor get ur resto gear go up to 2k rating get ur feral shoulders n be happy. Yes i can easily do that, get some sort of healing gear and get my feral shoulders, but will this make me happy ? <br />
<br />
I rolled feral for a reason, cz i ENJOY(got it?) playing this spec, it's a playstyle i love and i will stick to it, i dont rly care about the gear, itemzation was crap after tbc -imo- anw. It's just sad cz restos are kinda a bit op in the small bracets of arena for the rest trees to be hurt as well. Affli locks are kinda op as well, do they keep tossing destro nerfs to make the afflis less op ?<br />
<br />
Some ppl will say its just an ability that only hurts 1 tree, who cares? that tree cares cz that tree already sucks and keep getting nerfs while there are bugs for the last years that devs cant fix, range bug any1 ?<br />

peace.</div></div><hr />

I don't make stuff up. This is how it actually is. Hunters, Shamans, Paladins and Mages are the ones getting $%* on by druids, rogues, warriors, priests and warlocks. But mostly druids, warriors and rogues. So yes, I'm still sure I want to say that.</div></div><hr />

So.. By your logic most people who play the druid class are just absolutely amazing and theres nothing else going on? The people playing shaman are horrible too for the most part, but those who roll warriors are generally really skilled players who just dominate because of their skills<br />

I only said hunters and possibly shamans. The problem is that these particular two have high learning curve BUT when played correctly can be deadly (see: Hamchook / Beasteh (hunters) and GC (shaman) for example). Mages and Paladins not so much are on a different ballpark. By learning curve and ONLY in the case of hunters I'm referring to pvp awareness only since Hunters in order to be good have to outgrow the whole BEASTMASTERY LOL IM RED AND SHOOT AT THINGS mentality they get while leveling up and by raiding. In the case of shamans, it's a whole different learning curve. <br />
<br />
How could you argue the fact that mages are absolutely fine in terms of balance and they still got a low number representation? The fact is balancing due to number representation is flawed considering certain classes have something that's called SYNERGY and numerous other factors. You can pair a druid with a rogue, a warrior, a warlock and a hunter - however you can't say the same for a mage, for example.<br />
<br />
Furthermore these graphs do not reflect actual rising trends (for example: the number of rising Hunter + Druid teams in 2s since the start of s3).<br />
<br />
And to answer your question yes, I DO believe it's because they (hunters) are keyboard turning clickers that can't play worth shit. I dare you to prove me wrong.<br />

Mages are balanced till you get to the very high rated teams. They are unbalanced there, but no more severely than hunters and shamans. Furthermore, you cannot argue that because a few extremely &quot;talented&quot; players have done well. Take a look at the tournament realm, that does in fact take into account the recent changes. It must be an exciting tournament...the GREAT WOW Druid and partner tournament, where every player in the world rolls a resto druid and gets a warlock rogue or warrior as a partner. Sooooo...keep arguing that anything to curb the resto druid problem is a bad idea. And obviously hunters are not unbalanced, they all just are bad at playing their class cause everyone on the interwebs says huntards so they all must actually be much worse than the 10 year olds rolling warriors.</div></div><hr />

Haha how could you argue Mages are balanced until you get to the top without any sort of reason as to why your point is valid and then dare to mock my whole argument around the fact that anyone can say anything in the internet. <br />
<br />
Please finish your sentence about &quot;talented&quot; players. Here's hoping you can argue why I think the classes have steep learning curves which is what I was arguing when I mentioned these stellar players.<br />
<br />
Also since when is the tournament realm 2v2? Sounds like you know shit.<br />
<br />
Lastly: who gives a fuck about Druids? Cause I don't. Where have I ever argued in favor of druids in this whole topic? Please quote where I did. Either way (back to my point) hunters do not have it bad and you still haven't proved otherwise. I am speaking from experience here instead of your random and completely absurd attempts at rebutting my every sentence. <br />
<br />
Please save yourself the trouble and stop posting cause if you play as well as you argue then no wonder you think hunters need balancing. Pro tip: you can chase people in arenas since the dead-zone nerf and still shoot them instead of standing in the middle and hoping your opponent peeks out.</div></div><hr />

dude, stop talking...you look like a fool. Wait, you are a fool. But you shouldn't want to look like one in front of the whole internet. The whole WORLD(of warcraft) is figuring out that nothing you say makes any sense at all. There are 2v2 teams on the tournament realms. 3v3 and 2v2 are pretty close when it comes to balancing. Mages have consistently been shown to be well represented in 2v2 and 2v2 until you reach the 2200 bracket by many, many scans of the top players in the world. Hunters have consistently been among the bottom classes, along with paladins. I never said &quot;hunters have it bad.&quot; But as of now they have one legitimate playing option, resto druid. And that is true for most classes. That is why this scare beast has been implemented. And to finish the sentence, you cannot argue that because a few extremely &quot;talented&quot;(talent in parentheses because being good at a video game is a lame thing to call someone talented at cause they are wasting their life) have succeeded, does not mean the class is balanced. Druids should not take less significantly less skill than all other classes to succeed at.</div></div><hr />

BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH making no sense.<br />
<br />
1. The tournament is 3v3. The 2v2s are worth nothing and they are played only for fun.<br />
<br />
2. You're only talking about high rated 2v2. What's up with the 3s and 5s?<br />
<br />
3. Giving a new skill to an already versatile class is Blizzard's answer to &quot;balancing&quot; druids? Give me a break. Next we're gonna give Shamans a instant cast 30 yard fear that works on Warriors even with Berserker Rage and on Rogues even if they're CLoSd just to &quot;balance&quot; their number representation in arenas. <br />
<br />
4. Stellar players DO show that their class is just fine. How could you argue against that? You're asking for a class to become &quot;EASIER&quot; and more casual friendly when it is already fine. Do you think a skilled individual could take a prot warrior to #1 in a difficult battlegroup? No, because that would be next to impossible. But it can be done with hunters and shamans - so what does that tell you?<br />
<br />
5. The reason druids are high in numbers isn't because they are &quot;easier to play&quot; even if this is part of the problem. It's because of the nature of how Blizzard implemented their healing past TBC is what makes them the best (HoTs). You can move around and heal as well as CC. How can you compete with that with other healers? You can't. Therefore people move to playing druids instead of the traditional paladin (hi S1!) that had to stop and cast a heal. If you want to balance a druid in pvp take away his HoTs and make cyclone dispelable - then you have balance across the board with all the other healers. But that's not gonna happen.</div></div><hr />

Those are the numbers so far for the 3v3 tournament played among the best players from across all battlegroups. That is why hunters are getting buffed at druids expense. If you want to continue to argue against blatant facts that everyone is shoving at you then please continue to talk about other random theories you have. Blizzard seems to see a problem with the game they created, maybe you should go bring them your philosophy on why all hunters, shamans and paladins are just innately worse players than druids.</div></div><hr />

So by your reasoning we should imply that Blizzard's solution to druids which you say is their problem is giving an unheard-of instant cast crowd control spell to a class that most likely will never use it to its full potential?<br />
<br />
In a tournament that the final prize is a shit-load of money I don't expect teams to fuck around but instead choose whatever is best to counter-comp their opponents (welcome to 3v3). How can you base your whole argument around a tournament which has so much variability when it comes to class utilization? And once again only a handful of players can take the hunter class as far as 2200 rating so it isn't surprising that the numbers aren't high at all. <br />

Ever heard of intimidating shout? How about blind? Last time I checked neither have cast times. No one has ever heard of those though. And you continuously refute yourself...&quot;And once again only a handful of players can take the hunter class as far as 2200 rating...&quot; soooo, wait; does this mean the hunter class is extremely difficult to get a high rating with so Blizzard should do something to help it counter the most over powered class in the game? I'm willing to bet that all those hunters who managed to get 2400 ratings on the live realms tried to do it again on the tournament realms and failed.

Every 3 out of 4 topics is pvp nowadays. And it's not like there's a lot to talk about. Just PVE vs PVP, PVP vs whinyPVP, moar rating vs less rating. C'mon seriously.<br />
Agreed. I keep getting notifications of new replies to this topic for days, yet nothing new ever is said. *unsubscribes*</div></div><hr />

Wait, you are a fool. But you shouldn't want to look like one in front of the whole internet. The whole WORLD(of warcraft) is figuring out that nothing you say makes any sense at all. There are 2v2 teams on the tournament realms. 3v3 and 2v2 are pretty close when it comes to balancing. Mages have consistently been shown to be well represented in 2v2 and 2v2 until you reach the 2200 bracket by many, many scans of the top players in the world. Hunters have consistently been among the bottom classes, along with paladins. I never said &quot;hunters have it bad.&quot; But as of now they have one legitimate playing option, resto druid. And that is true for most classes. That is why this scare beast has been implemented. And to finish the sentence, you cannot argue that because a few extremely &quot;talented&quot;(talent in parentheses because being good at a video game is a lame thing to call someone talented at cause they are wasting their life) have succeeded, does not mean the class is balanced. Druids should not take less significantly less skill than all other classes to succeed at.<br />
<br />
<br />
To all - please use paragraphs.<br />
<br />
Class representation:<br />
<br />
The worse 2v2 class atm are mages, with palas, shamies and hunters not much better (well shamies a bit better). Only below 1600 rankings (quite below) do mages outnumber hunters (which means that their median classification is bellow hunters - well, actually bellow every other class).<br />
<br />

<br />
If you mean by &quot;well represented&quot; being at 27% of the target representation (100%) @ 2000, well you are a natural born politician :P<br />
<br />
One could also digress about the hunter design should actually be - by far - the worse performer in the arenas - and that their poor standings reflect more of the arena design failures than any hunter class frailties.<br />
<br />
Anyway, imo arena is a sidegame that should simply be removed from wow into the CS minded realms - like the tournament one :)<br />
<br />
Btw, does anyone knows if it is being popular or not really?</div></div><hr />

This is a over exaggeration, right? I'd suggest you arena at 2k with a hunter and get back to us.</div></div><hr />

I do, he's called Hamchook. Look up his info and let me know. Obliterated BG9 teams in WSVGs even before hunters got their dead-zone buff and dispel/ms.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ever heard of intimidating shout? How about blind? Last time I checked neither have cast times. No one has ever heard of those though.<br />
<br />
Yea because those are really practical for CC right? I mean not that they have 3 minute cooldowns or anything. Not to mention the fact that hunters already have other means of crowd control.<br />
<br />
<br />
And you continuously refute yourself...&quot;And once again only a handful of players can take the hunter class as far as 2200 rating...&quot; soooo, wait; does this mean the hunter class is extremely difficult to get a high rating with so Blizzard should do something to help it counter the most over powered class in the game? I'm willing to bet that all those hunters who managed to get 2400 ratings on the live realms tried to do it again on the tournament realms and failed. When it comes down to it, hunters are going to lose to the best of the best every time. And that is an issue Blizzard is working on.<br />
<br />
&quot;And once again only a handful of players can take the hunter class as far as 2200 rating... at the tournament realm&quot;. Thanks for taking my sentence out of context. &quot;Does this mean the hunter class is extremely difficult?&quot; Not extremely, but like I've replied again and again it takes more of an effort to play a hunter in arenas that it does in any other aspect of the game... therefore since most cannot make the transition, they fail.<br />
<br />
This is what you're not getting: WHAT THE FUCK does balancing hunters have to do with reducing the number of druids in arena? NOTHING. Because when all is said and done, even with an instant hunter fear, the number of druids WILL NOT decrease. What do you think priest will take the helm or something? Yea cause they aren't already counter-comped by Viper Sting and double melee teams? <br />

wow, did you realy say you guys need a buff? There are other classes which should get buffed!! (e.g. Shamen).<br />
Anyway, there are to many &quot;Legolas&quot; running around which have no skills and cry till they got their &quot;easy win button&quot;. I know so many Hunter, that are soooooo bad in this game it hurts and many of them are also on the Tournament Realm and thats why it looks like you guys have a huge disadvantage. Skilled player switch to healing classes, cause this is today the biggest challenge in wow; in arena and pve. Its not dps'ing and not tanking.</div></div><hr />

I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume English is your second language. Anywho...I don't think a Lord of the Rings character and some bad hunters you know is enough to attribute hunters' lack of representation in higher arena brackets to the players just being bad. I know a ton of really terrible warriors who just picked the class because 'warriors are the coolest.' How does this factor in to warriors being hugely represented? Shouldn't they not be in the top arenas cause kids just pick it to be cool and stink at their class?</div></div><hr />

You're mistaken, it's 3 minutes - also what set bonus? Are you referring to priest's fear? Even if I think its absurd that they're buffing other classes just to reduce the number of druids (the should just buff if a class actually needs it and not in relation to any other class) in arena I'm intrigued as to how it will play out. If anything they should have given the fear to shamans and just increase the range on hunter's fear beasts instead of doing that and making it instant. Either way I can guarantee you any change that is made in this patch will not decrease druid numbers. Like I said before, if Blizzard wants to decrease the number of druids in arena they should just remove their HoTs so they actually have to stop and cast something. The druid is the mobile healer, and while that remains true it will not make druids any less desirable in Arena.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest there is no reason why there needs to be no cast time on the fear. Simply increasing the range to a more reasonable number would have been substantial. I already use fear beast quite often against druids, but 10 yards is quite quite short. A shaman with a fear may be overpowered I am afraid though. Sort of like resto druids with cyclone I suppose...But still, we will have to see how this all plays out. I think it will significantly impact the healing balance and make those few teams that challenged with hunters/non druid healers compete better.</div></div><hr />

You’re on an arena tournament realm bud.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
btw. You’re view is based on what a fear buff does to druid popularity. But if you look at the whole picture you'll realize that the buff is meant to impacts druids and increase the demand of hunters in pvp. That is why this buff is being considered for hunters instead of a druid nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, I'm not Hamchook, I've played with him though.<br />
<br />
Nobody is arguing whether its a buff or a nerf for any class. The whole argument is that if Blizzard did in fact do this for hunters just to decrease the number of druids, then what's stopping them of adding some gimmick OP ability to the next form of pvp when say, for example a certain class becomes the popular one? It's flawed logic. <br />
<br />
Don't worry though... cause when Paladins (or shamans) become the #1 healers again they will have to give hunters a Paladin/Shaman fear.<br />
<br />
Either way I guess at least shitty hunters will realize they had that fear in the first place - which I bet have never even thought of using in arena.</div></div><hr />
