That would be a rap for legion now , wouldn't. speaking of order halls, hope they would be faction shared , and the temptation of Chaos bolting that clueless new player to the twisting nether would be a delight, and yes, don't mind getting reckt by the guards instantly.</div></div><hr />

This is a direct result of people asking for a few more moonkin models, after seeing the pletora of new cat and bear models / skins that come with the artifact weapon.<br />

You make it sound like Excuses are a thing Blizzard has in short supply and must use sparingly. They will make excuses for every failed/scrapped,dumb downed feature ever... Just as they always have. Never underestimate Blizzard ability to generate excuses for their failings and poor communication/actions towards their customer base.<br />

Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhh those new bears. I love the level of detail, I HATE the model, so much. It just keeps getting worse with every update; the butt is WAY too high, the back looks broken (although the druid's mane sort of hides that a little), the head is too big, the back isn't long enough. Mostly it's how high the butt is/how low the head is that bothers me the most. That's not what bears look like, Blizz.<br />
<br />
Also I'm finding the tier sets really underwhelming so far for all classes.</div></div><hr />

No the idea of the missions is they go &amp; scout out than come back &amp; inform you. Than we go out with them. <br />

If you see the mission is only 15 secs.</div></div><hr />

Let's keep calm until the feature is ready to ship and can't/won't be changed. For me the purpose of alpha/beta is not only test to find bugs it is also to test features, mechanics a.s.o. - but on the other hand - blizzard nor or seldom change features they invested time in due to customer feedback - the phrase &quot;we listen to you&quot; is just a lip service ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
In any case, I don't want to see the effing command table anymore. It's not fun at all. I want to quest not to assign random guys with a command table to unlock a mission or whatever.<br />
<br />
They just want to recycle their command table and followers UI and for me it's a huge no-no. There are enough point and click facebook games out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They made the right choice NOT to let lava burst always crit, so it can actually scale well with crit and be more balanced for PVP and do good instead of wussy base damage, because it's not always a crit. Now they've changed it back... Too bad.</div></div><hr />

Nope - irrational or constructive every feedback is (seems) getting ignored (sometimes it feels like they have a phobia to accept an idea from the community - I think they fear that the guy can stand up and say - hey that was my idea my feature - now I sue them for cash). <br />
<br />
But I must say that the majority of the feedback given to them is utter crap. Rarely a feedback met there understanding of the game and in such cases it seems they have listened. Can you give me some examples of feedback that they accepted (just curious)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not how that works...but it's funny that you think that. They have also used tons of ideas from the player base over the years. Which makes it pretty damned apparent that just because they don't respond to every special little snowflake that thinks they deserve a response, doesn't mean they don't actually look at them.<br />
<br />
But this will just get me called a white knight...because if you don't agree with &quot;blizzard ignores us&quot; you're a white knight apparently.</div></div><hr />

Raid and dungeon boss balancing, ship mission durations, flight, mount cast times, heirloom mgmt, death of the hybrid tax, etc. So many things have come directly from user feedback.</div></div><hr />
