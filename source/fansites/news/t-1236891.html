Ion Hazzikostas Interview<br />
Today's interview is with Ion Hazzikostas (Lead Encounter Designer) on ConvertToRaid (http://converttoraid.com/home/m/2780615/article/1156167). A summary of the main points is below, but listening to the full interview is worth it if you want to hear the full answers!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Looking back at the daily quests, anything that rewards player power feels mandatory to raiders, but this has to be balanced with giving purely cosmetic rewards. There has to be enough of a reward to encourage players to do some quests, but not so much that it feels mandatory for everyone.<br />
The Patch 5.1 daily quests took in to account the Golden Lotus daily quests that rewarded you with more daily quests and kept the number being added this time more reasonable. <br />
Blizzard wants to keep delivering content and storyline progression through daily quests, because it gives you a better understanding and connection to the faction you are assisting. Tabards ended up with the player running dungeons for rep and never learning anything about the faction whose tabard they had on.<br />
Valor Points being necessary for raiders due to item upgrades feels better than daily quests because of all of the different sources for earning Valor Points versus only being able to do daily quests for reputation. <br />
Brawler's Guild is working out well, with the limited invites keeping queues reasonable.<br />
Showing the number of LFR bosses that are dead was making it very slow to fill groups. <br />
The addition of LFR has allowed Blizzard to target Normal difficulty more towards organized guilds that play together regularly and use voice chat. Previously, Normal difficulty was used by both organized guilds and PuGs, which made it somewhat easier than intended.<br />
Staggering the release of the raids worked out well. <br />
Heroic Sha of Fear was a worthy end boss in terms of the amount of time it took to defeat. It is almost impossible to make encounters that the best guilds won't be able to beat in a matter of days when they are spending so much time raiding. Only 28 guilds (http://www.wowprogress.com/encounter/sha-of-fear-heroic) have killed Heroic Sha of Fear so far.<br />
Larger patches in the past needed everything to be complete before shipping, which sometimes caused delays. With separate patches for raids and the other content, we are able to see more frequent patches.<br />
Patch 5.2 is coming Soon™ (http://www.wowpedia.org/Soon) and will include a large and more traditional raid tier. It has been a while since we had a raid zone that was as large as Ulduar or Icecrown Citadel. Blizzard will talking about what will be in it and how many bosses soon! <br />
<br />
<br />
Method Interview<br />
Manaflask (http://www.manaflask.com/en/article/2115/the-tier-14-king-method-triumphant) had the opportunity to speak with members of Method (http://www.manaflask.com/en/article/2115/the-tier-14-king-method-triumphant) about their thoughts on the first set of Mists of Pandaria raids. They seemed happy with the staggered raid releases, pointing out that it worked as promised by allowing them to not have to try and do all of the bosses at once. <br />
<br />
Method agreed with what Ion said in the interview above, saying &quot;In my opinion the difficulty of these encounters are harder than ever, people are judging the content on the speed in which top guilds are beating these encounters when they shouldn't be. The quality of the guilds in the Top 10 now are so high it's impossible for an encounter to stay alive more than 1 reset unless its either bugged or impossible&quot;.<br />

Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
Pet Battle Abilities that use a shoot or missile animation will now properly display their visual effect.<br />
Disabling Loss of Control in the Interface menu will now also disable the red cooldown swipes on the action bar in addition to the notification in the center of the screen.

When Loss of Control Alerts are enabled, the red cooldown swipes will not be displayed for abilities that were already on cooldown and in situations where that cooldown will last longer than the loss of control.<br />
Night will now fall at the proper time on all realms.<br />
Objective icons in Scenarios will no longer incorrectly persist until the Scenario is complete.<br />
Fixed an issue that could cause crashes during Pet Battles.<br />

Patch 5.2 Monk Changes<br />
The following changes are currently on the table for 5.2:<br />
<br />
Life Cocoon (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/116849) will be undispellable and won’t interrupt the cast at the end of the effect (and players will also be able to jump as well).<br />
We’re working to resolve the issues with Renewing Mist (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115151) not being able to be used while mounted, though it will dismount the caster after it is cast.<br />
Soothing Mist (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115175) will no longer be able to be Purged, so it will work in a manner similar to the Priest's Penance (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/47666). It will still be considered a periodic Heal (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/2050).<br />
(Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/247681-a-few-mistweaver-qol-changes-pvp/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7379317872#2))<br />
<br />
CC in PvP<br />
CC in general is totally out of control, too much instant !@#$ going on<br />
We would very much like to make it so that more crowd controls start going back to having a cast time. We feel that instant cast spells should be something that's rare to see and we admit that they have become far too common. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/247647-world-of-stuncraft-why-didnt-deathwing-kill-us/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6133773365?page=1#7))<br />
<br />
LFR Boss Counter Removal Feedback<br />
&quot;oh no someone decided they didn't want to chaperone the mouth-breathing astounding idiots, we better penalise them for valuing their own time.&quot; Your logic, and apparently Blizzard's too.<br />
One of the reasons why the counter was removed was to reduce the amount of players fishing for a fresh instance. It was something that was becoming an issue for all the players that were stuck in on-going groups waiting for new players to join. <br />
<br />
When those groups were waiting at, say 2/3, the queue would start looking for new replacements, those replacements would see the queue and decided to skip it in favor of a fresh instance, creating and endless loop for the guys inside the instance where more people would leave as they grew impatient, making it harder to complete the run.<br />
<br />
As it is right now, if you enter an on-going run, you're pretty much guaranteed a fresh instance on your next visit. In addition, the developers are considering adding a buff that players in LFR might receive if they wipe on a boss that would boost their stats, which they also hope it might help those impatient players that will leave their current LFR run after a wipe. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/247646-wy-are-we-forced-to-accept-any-half-lfr/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6101760586?page=1#9))<br />
<br />
Future Challenge Modes<br />
Will you guys ever consider adding more CMs, perhaps old dungeons like Ragefire Chasm/Wailing Caverns?<br />
Actually, the developers would like to add Challenge Modes to existing dungeons from previous expansions. No timelines or anything, though, but it's definitely something they're considering. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/247637-the-future-of-challenge-modes/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6101570229?page=1#5))<br />
<br />
Bonus Roll Feedback<br />
While I understand that getting an item that you already have can be somewhat frustrating, this is actually nothing new, since the very beginning of WoW that players have been killing bosses and getting completely randomized loot.<br />
<br />
The Elder Charms of Good Fortune are supposed to be an extra chance at getting loot, if anything, having this option the way it currently is, might be already too loot “friendly” in my opinion. <br />
<br />
This option was added because we understand that sometimes players can be after a specific item (remember those Dragonspine Trophy hunting days…), this way they get to decide which bosses are the most important for their characters and have a higher chance of grabbing a specific item that they’re so anxious to get their hands on. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/247636-gold-coins-changes/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6101020432?page=2#25))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Character<br />
RE: Player Model Upgrade difficulty; Greg, can you elaborate for laymen what makes the project &quot;huge&quot;? Implies more than skin.<br />
Look at the Pandaren as an example. New textures need new models which need new animations. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273166112781369344))<br />
<br />
I would say overall &quot;too little to do&quot; has not been feedback we have heard often for MoP. For Cataclysm, yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273179487598952448))<br />
<br />
Can a new 90 alt catch up gear-wise this arena season with conquest being usable for item upgrades? MoP seems alt-unfriendly.<br />
We agree we need more alt solutions. MoP was designed to be compelling without alts. That means if you have alts, there's too much (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270995686827360256))<br />
<br />
Hey can we get an option to mail guild invites to alts?<br />
Would love to see that (with some kind of guildmaster control). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270700729054920704))<br />
<br />
Yes that may be true but did you guys ever stop to think and listen to people saying gating isn't fun.<br />
Yes. The opposite of gating tends to be epic grinding followed by nothing to do. We try to strike a balance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272792552640495617))<br />
<br />
&quot;There was no alternative to the head enchant. There are plenty of alternatives to valor gear.&quot; what are they?<br />
Killing raid bosses for one. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273178341874466816))<br />
<br />
UI / Addons<br />
The new item tooltips are a mess. Whoever though this looked or conveyed information better was wrong. Please revert.<br />
We like it. Can you elaborate? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273552106974236672))<br />
<br />
The addon that let us paint the world? That could've been fun, but you engineered the game to stop that.<br />
it wasn't to nerf fun. It took all the individual responsibility out of raiding. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/271386351784587264))<br />
<br />
Talent/Glyph + D.Journal taint bug is starting to drive me nuts. Reload UI 2-3 times to use stuff Bliz pushed as key features?<br />
Taint bugs are almost certainly caused by mods trying to access stuff they shouldn't. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273167027043180544))<br />
<br />
Hey will WoW's taint detection be worked on? I am pretty fed up of my addons being blamed for things they don't even look at.<br />
If the addon goes after a protected feature, it gets the taint. It's pretty cut and dried as far as I know. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270595501202755584))<br />
75% of my raid has to /reloadui to change glyphs/talents. Taint spreads like defile! Very difficult to debug.<br />
I am sympathetic, but we can't debug all of the addons players develop. There are great sites out there that attempt to do so. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270624444458868736))<br />
<br />
Why are UX /UI changes slow in WoW vs. system changes?<br />
Depends on the change, but UI often involves code changes while many class changes can be done through data (by designers). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/270633823224594433))<br />
<br />
Can we have a UI feature to show how much of an enemy absorb we have left to break through? Absorb Absorb Absorb isn't helpful<br />
Yes that's definitely on our wish list. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/272427001686654976))<br />

Yep, now the frost mages will be even more op with the critical mass buff and being to spread their combustion to another target<br />
<br />
Oh wait...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phuzi0n</div><div class="date">2012-12-11, 02:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inferno Blast now spreads Ignite, Pyroblast, and Combustion to 3 surrounding targets.<br />
Are they done picking on fire mages yet? Yeah fire was strong at aoe but it takes time to build up and they already nerfed the hell out of combustion 50%. There are plenty of other classes/specs that are still amazing at aoe and others that are not but none of them are being touched.<br />
<br />
Back in classic every aoe spell had unlimited targets but few classes had aoe's. Then they put damage caps on aoe's that made them do a maximum amount of damage regardless of ap/sp (but crits didn't count toward the cap) so that aoe dps vs 10 mobs would be the same as vs 100 but that they would design encounters to never need to aoe more than ~10 mobs. Then they added aoe for every class so that nobody would be left out even though many of the aoe's were still garbage and have a min or max number of mobs that are needed to be effective.<br />
<br />
Now we're left in this ridiculous situation where there's no consistency at all when it comes to aoe's and they put a few huge ~10-20 mob trash pulls in all the raids. Some classes/specs have aoe's that are uncapped and do huge damage often through dots (any tanks, dk's, ass rogues, sv hunters, etc.), some have uncapped aoe that does pathetic damage and doesn't become viable until the mob count is relatively high (combat/sub rogues), some have capped aoe that is usually mediocre at best for 5-10 mobs (things like arcane explosion, blizzard, rain of fire) and get terribly out-shined by uncapped aoe's as the mob count increases, while not technically aoe - some have multitarget &quot;cleave&quot; type spells (chain lightning, blade flurry, sweeping strikes) which excel at low mob counts.<br />
<br />
While variety is good, the disparity between aoe's is far too great. They need to bring all true aoe's closer in line with each other and decide whether to uncap them all or to cap them all and stop designing encounters that exceed the caps. Cleave type abilities should also be reigned in to not provide such large dps increases because it makes class/spec stacking more mandatory.<br />

Critical mass is a fire spec passive that used to give 1.5x crit chance but was nerfed and is only getting a minor buff that is still much less than it originally was. Inferno Blast is a fire spec spell getting a HUGE NERF that cripples fire spec aoe and turns it into a spec that can only cleave 3 targets. Neither of these affect PvP much at all.</div></div><hr />

Are you daft?<br />
<br />
The inferno blast change is a buff. It used to affect 2 nearby targets with our dots, now it does 3. Totaling 4 targets now instead of 3.<br />
<br />
4 &gt; 3<br />
<br />
Also fwiw, if you are trying to help down 10 target adds, change up your bomb to Frost Bomb. Ya ignite spread is still limited but this helps.</div></div><hr />

Forgive me for not noticing that they had nerfed it to 2 targets when it was 5 at release and back in cata before inferno blast we had infinite spreading... So it's another minor buff after a huge nerf, praise the blizzard gods? It still doesn't change the fact that there is a huge disparity between aoe capabilities that is far more important than these minor changes.</div></div><hr />

I just tire of the knee jerk post crying when we've had target limits for awhile now, including long before the original nerf. Having your facts that wrong from the get go just make you look like an uninformed whiner. If you play fire as you seem to indicate, you would most assuredly have known about the target limit by now and if you didn't, it invalidates your opinion imo. <br />
<br />
My take (as a fire mage who IS paying attention and forming my own opinions based on my own raiding and experience with the changes) is that they are &quot;fixing&quot; us in the wrong way. The CM boost is negligible but whatever, but the fights we still excel at (Garalon, Amber Shaper, Wind Lord, Empress, Stone Guard, etc) were already due to dot spreading, adding another target to that only makes us better at something we are the best at, but that isn't the problem. We lag in single target. The combustion change hurt this hugely, instead of adding more cleave (which phuzi0n is really the only person I've seen butt hurt by this) they just needed to boost fireball, pyroblast damage or coeffs a bit. I like critting more because it makes the rotation more dynamic, so I'd rather CM was left at 1.5 and have reduction on some of the abilities to balance, in either case this hotfix is puzzling, it's just the wrong fix. <br />
<br />
TL:DR: To fix the overnerf they added cleave which wasn't our problem to begin with. Please look at single target damage blizz!</div></div><hr />

Wind Lord Mel'jarak and Grand Empress Shek'zeer have large aoe phases. <br />
<br />
Garalon, The Stone Guard, and Amber-Shaper Un'sok are heavily cleave favored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing you're talking about dungeon bosses based on your post. The saurok boss in Mogu'shan Palace is good for cleaving.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play many classes and yes I overlooked that it was a minor buff after a long series of nerfs to fire but please explain how that completely invalidates my opinion that there is a huge disparity between forms of aoe? Do you think it's fair that certain classes/specs do 2-10x as much damage as others depending on the number of mobs? On my rogue I have to constantly switch between Assassination and Combat because Ass has huge poison dmg for ~5+ mob aoe but Combat has huge cleave damage, but at least I have the option. On my mage fire spec is good at pretty much everything that matters (it only lacks in massive uncap aoe) so I don't really care too much about minor changes, I'm just sick of so many changes that are hard to keep track of. On my other classes sometimes there's just nothing I can do and have to put up with whatever aoe limits it has.</div></div><hr />

Ragnaros was the end boss of the second tier of raiding of the last expansion while Sha is the end boss of the first tier of this one...terrible comparison. Also, if a guild that's fully cleared it says it's quite difficult, then I'd probably side with their argument over someone who I can't verify.</div></div><hr />
