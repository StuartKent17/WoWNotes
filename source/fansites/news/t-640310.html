Guaranteed slam crit following charge for Arms. If only slam was usable while moving, eh?<br />

Imp. zerker buff along with a switch to strength should help fury a bit to recover from the nerf.<br />

Warbringer affecting everything... is not a change, i thought it already did that.<br />

Dissapointed for the third time. First was spirit change, second fire still crap in pvp and now this.<br />

<br />
First, they nerf the burst by halving damage, but also halving cooldown. Result? Less damage per runic power.<br />
<br />
Now, they halve the duration even after that. Dancing rune weapon now lasts 11 seconds with 100 runic power, 14 seconds with 130. If glyphed, it gains 5 more seconds.<br />
<br />
Just by doing uptime vs damage, you gain 6,11% more dps, but then again, you waste a good bunch of runic power. Sounds like unholy blight is more tempting <br />
imo, or just coil it all away.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Change to DRW glyph just arrived... seriously, this is total crap. It better be 100% now, but I know it's not.</div></div><hr />

That scorch &quot;buff&quot; is still a sad excuse to make it better.<br />

<br />
Warlocks won't be counted on to keep up the debuff. Casting one scorch every 27 seconds or so is far from crippling, and it is at least more reliable considering how Warlocks like to send their pink fluffy beams as soon as the boss gets under 35(?)%.</div></div><hr />

Gms think it is OK that a retri critted me or 22k im not under geared and im plate...<br />
<br />
Didn't know Thaddius was able to write posts :) Now seriously, a 22k crit is impossible without big damage modifiers.<br />
<br />
And I really hope that in next build they add any other PVE Ret buff, since it's very likely ret paladins will fall down in dps compared with all the other hybrids (lets not talk about the pure dpsers)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
the fact that if you want a mage to bring that debuff requires him to use glyph of improved scorch says enough.<br />
<br />
If they dont get that glyph in the start of the fight they have to cast it 5 times in a row which is just riduculous when you look how a warlock applies it.<br />
Secondly, taking that glyph leaves no room for Glyph of LB, which a mage will need if it wants to keep up with the warlocks buffs.<br />
<br />
A good guild and mages/warlocks will see which class is the best to bring this debuff.</div></div><hr />

Giving Ret some tools is awesome. Crusader Strike is now useful. As of right now, Ret plain sucks. They have nothing offensive except a stun everyone can get out of, trinket or whatever. Oh yeah, and the crappy repentance.<br />
<br />
Seriously, shut it. Ret are not that strong at all right now, just got high burst damage, Holy is dominating.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget Kings scaling - it puts the AP output roughly at the same level. And you scale better with Horn of Winter/Totem now.<br />

They probably put in the change to get Warriors away from using leather items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In most raid situations, at least one Paladin has Kings. Since Kings scales and AP does not, this is a 10% buff on the AP bonus from Str. Therefore, more accurately, it's ~1000 Str + 10% of that, or 1100 Str, which amounts to around 330 AP. Tbh, the amount of AP lost is pretty negligible.<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage<br />
Glyph of Improved Scorch -- The Improved Scorch talent now generates 5 (up from 3) applications of the Improved Scorch effect each time Scorch is cast.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So we only cast scorch once at the beginning of the fight instead of twice, but still have to use a major glyph slot for a talent warlocks apply on one cast of their main nuke, yeah ok that makes sense. <br />
<br />
Also increases crit of scorch LOL. Is that suppose to be a selfish benefit? More crit chance on a spell we don't cast? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlocks won't be counted on to keep up the debuff. Casting one scorch every 27 seconds or so is far from crippling, and it is at least more reliable considering how Warlocks like to send their pink fluffy beams as soon as the boss gets under 35(?)%.<br />
<br />
<br />
And mages want to cast fireball or frostfirebolt as soon as the boss gets under 35%. Why is it fine that we have to but you can't? Especially since you can get a free shadowbolt from nightfall procs. There no dps loss by casting 1 free shadow bolt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, as far as the paladin thing, GC said the crusader strike change will NOT be in 3.1. He said that it was something they were playing around with and was accidentally included in this patch, not intentionally. He said it would be too big of a change to make for paladins since they dont currently have an interrupt or MS and this would function as kind of a hybrid of both.

<br />
* Crusader Strike is now An instant strike that causes 110% weapon damage. In addition, if you strike a player while they are casting, their magical damage and healing will be reduced by 50% for 6 sec. <br />
<br />
That is not an official change. It is something we were experimenting with, but not a change we are going to make for 3.1. <br />
<br />
The short story is that while we want to make Crusader Strike a more exciting ability, we don't think that this is the way to go about it. The &quot;Overpower debuff&quot; won't really give them anything more interesting in PvE. In PvP it isn't as game-changing for a warrior who already had access to an interrupt and the Mortal Strike debuff. Giving both of those to a paladin could be very game-changing and not the kind of thing we are ready to do without a lot more testing. <br />
<br />
Sorry for any confusion. Sometimes in our haste to update the PTR as often as we can, you get a chance to see behind the curtain a little more than we intend. :)<br />

<br />
Yep what he says is true. Shadow Bolt is the main nuke for 1 warlock build, affliction. Which you might see less of since according to simcraft, it has been dethroned by another spec as the top dog. <br />
<br />
Every other raiding spec besides affliction uses incinerate as their main nuke. So keep that in mind. And below 25% mob health, you arent going to see many shadow bolts because affliction warlocks will be using drain soul. So far even with the changes made to drain soul, it is still a dps loss if we use shadow bolts below 25% health and not drain soul.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm.. Yeah your totally right, instead warlocks don't even have to waste a glyph slot, they get 5% applied automatically on one cast by speccing into the talent.<br />
<br />
<br />
shadow bolt has significantly longer cast time, and travel time as well so timing is an issue.<br />
I don't see how this fact makes it 'harder' to time.. your still having to time both shadowbolt and scorch.. just cause they have different cast times changes nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
just like scorch is a dps loss, spamming shadow bolt to keep the debuff up is also a dps loss.<br />
you don't need to 'spam' anything, you cast shadowbolt once every 30 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
not that many warlock builds can afford to spend those 5 talent points, since they dont use shadow bolt at all.<br />
Just like all the best mage specs/rotations will miss out scorch in 3.1, there are plenty of other talents we can take instead.<br />
<br />
Overall from keeping up scorch we lose: <br />
<br />
One glyph slot<br />
Three WASTED talent points<br />
Having to use a spell which does significantly lower DPS than our main nuke.<br />
<br />
Warlocks Have:<br />
5 talent points which also give 5% damage on their main nuke, so they would get it anyway if they are using a spec which casts shadowbolt.<br />
<br />
and no downsides 0.o<br />
<br />
It's up in the air over who applies the debuff, I havn't discussed it with my guild yet, but from the looks of it if a warlock is specced for shadowbolt anyway then they will be keeping the debuff up as it's much easier for them.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
below 25% mob health, you arent going to see many shadow bolts because affliction warlocks will be using drain soul.<br />

Mage Spell - Molten Fury (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=31680)<br />

This is actually a nerf. The epic plate itemization is HORRIBLE and switching to plate from near full leather will net you less total AP and net stats than you would leather. Not to mention they've killed off oh, just about every freaking scaling ability from trinkets all the way to DPS rings for warriors.<br />
<br />
And GC's comment on the Imp Zerker Stance was like reading one of Tseric's old fistfuls of misinformation. Makes me glad I can't be bother to play anymore, they're so out of touch it's ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

where are rogues balanced? oh you mean visual pvp balance? yes may be rogues are fine atm and working as intended, but wtf other 9 classes are better? nerf them or buff rogues back..really we received our nerf bats when ppl had no gear, no resilence..etc etc..now when my 60 energy muti crits a mage or lock for 3k in end game pvp gear.. yeah this is balanced..or better thing equip PVe gear in PVP and die 4 sec earlier..because rogues have no survivability, you should know that<br />

imo the best way to balance ferals and buff shadow priests at the same time, is to move Feral druids &quot;reduced damage by 30% while stunned&quot; to the shadow priests tree, ferals don't need that... they got bear form =\</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cant think of any Hunter that cares about TNT stun being removed, since its very enoying when a Hunter is fighting a Hunter as well.<br />
But i just cannot believe they nerf every single bit a Survival Hunter has going along with it. (dejavu BM perhaps?) <br />
<br />
Nerf DMG from explosive shot, and then introduce a completly useless ability for PVP that shared CD with traps.<br />
Nerf Wyvern sting back to 1 min CD, and on a 6 sec duration. Why not nerf blind, fears, sheep and every other 10 sec CC to 6 sec as well?<br />
Nerf Entrapment from having 25% random roots 4 sec to having it 1x root for 6 sec, and now nerfing it AGAIN to 1x root for 4 sec.<br />
Nerf the 1 talent Trap Mastery from increasing trap duration by 30% and dmg by 30% (freeze didnt even work in PVP), to a 3 talent increasing trap duration by 10% and for the rest it stays the same. 9 more snakes? Even if it was actually 90 snakes no Hunter would use a shit trap like snake.<br />
<br />
These arent even all the nerfs.. but Blizzard is making the same mistake for the 3rd time in a row now.<br />
<br />
1st, nerf BM to shit because everyone was BM (me included). Instead of nerfing only the 2x BW which was the only OP thing, they also took away pet dmg and steady shot dmg wich was actually the only thing a BM was all about. Then they try to make up for it by giving some pet dmg back a few months later.<br />
2nd, buff Survival so everyone goes Survival (me included), giving it some insane dmg and cc abilities. Random roots and stuns lawl.<br />
3rd, nerf Survival to shit because everyone is Survival now. Not only nerf TNT stuns and random roots wich was the only thing that made Survival OP, but also take away Explosive shot dmg, wyvern sting duration and cd, explosive shot crit, sniper training. And what did they get in return? Another ability Black arrow wich shares CDs with TRAPS (wich is the main thing a Survival Hunters is all about btw), and +3% agility to Hunting Party (cheers). With my 1.2k agility that makes up for 32 agility! Zomg huge increase indeed -.-.<br />
4th, buff MM because nobody is MM, and in 3.1 everyone will be MM. <br />
-100% chance to daze a target for 4 sec on a 10 sec CD shot.<br />
-3 talent points for a 5% dmg increase on ALL ranged attacks.<br />
-100% chance to get a bleed effect when critically hit doing 30% of the dmg dealt over time.<br />
-And dont forget about Wild Quiver, New entrapment (its still nice to have a timeable root), and Silence shot wich just became Hugely OP compared to Wyvern Sting. Silence shot: silence a target for 3 sec on a 20 sec CD and also deals dmg VS Wyvern Sting: Sleeps the target for 6 sec on a 60 sec CD, breaks on dmg, can be dispelled, and does dmg over time.. Hard choise indeed. <br />
<br />
Seriously if you have checked the new MM, its getting hugely buffed.<br />
<br />
I predict a nerf to MM about 1 month after 3.1 gets released, mark my words for it. Btw this was not a QQ, just stating facts and thinking out loud here.<br />
Also classes that dont play Hunter, dont respond to this, youve caused enough allready.</div></div><hr />

Yep they overnerf 1 spec and overbuff another. I will try to see how Surv feels after 3.1 but I think I end up respeccing MM for pvp (I think surv will be fine for pve)<br />
<br />
One bad thing about MM though: While the bleed will be nice against rogues and general dmg increase it will hurt the CC opporunities - breaks scatter and freezing (yes serpent does too but u can counter that with putting on another sting - u cant remove the bleed when needed)</div></div><hr />

Hard choise indeed. <br />
<br />
Seriously if you have checked the new MM, its getting hugely buffed.<br />
<br />
I predict a nerf to MM about 1 month after 3.1 gets released, mark my words for it. Btw this was not a QQ, just stating facts and thinking out loud here.<br />
Also classes that dont play Hunter, dont respond to this, youve caused enough allready.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup, I agree entirely. To be honest, I have never liked the Surv tree, though I'm going to miss 110% Stam and 115% Agility. I'm fine with respeccing marks, it has a much higher &quot;skill&quot; cap than Surv anyway (Readiness). Fuck I hope they don't massively nerf MM in 2 months.... That would just be a complete slap in the face.</div></div><hr />

Thats simple to explain. Those Rogues didnt know how to play the class properly. Same way as Druids that do bad in Arena now dont know how to play their class properly. Rank 1 on one of the BG's is a freakin Druid/Warr. Just because Druids, Warriors, Rogues, Warlocks cant faceroll to Glad rank anymore doesnt mean they are worthless.<br />
<br />
As you can see. Hunters are now owning in Arena because they got some rly good abilities (which they lose in a few weeks). The same thing happend for Druids, Warriors, Locks, and Rogues but they lasted for over 4 seasons. Start learning to play, rerolling DK wont help you 1 bit in 3.1.</div></div><hr />

ZOMG, let the nerf tears fall. BTW, the gap closes as STR goes up which it will if you toss that leather junk away. Roll a warr? Act like a warr.<br />
<br />
1200 STR and 3900AP = old one 390AP, new one 360AP<br />
1500 STR and 4500AP = 450AP each way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also start using weapon with strenght instead of atk power like those &quot;hunter&quot; weapons, lol. Of course sometimes you can't help but using the only 226 weapon, but guess things will change in 3.1 in the weapon area. I remember seeing necklace with str too... finally. So yes, maybe STR users will finally get good (and end-game) neck/ring/trinket/weapons with STR instead of ATK POWER.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it costs mages 3 talent points and a glyph. It costs warlocks 5 talent points and a spell, unused by any except one spec, that has a much longer cast time than Scorch. Looks like either class may have to make sacrifices.<br />
<br />
Rogues are looking pretty good on PTR, I wouldn't expect many more positive changes on that front. Pretty happy with where my mage sits, too.<br />

Not overly happy about the flask change...I somehow doubt that's going to drive the prices of them down any.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does anyone know how Fury's are doing in the test realms at the moment.<br />
<br />
I really enjoy being Fury and (although am obviously not that skilled though as in my guild I am only in the top 6-10 spots on an HC - I'm still waiting for a Naxx weapon drop!) but I enjoy the game so heh, who cares about not being near the top :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was wondering how much of a decrease in DPS Fury's are experiencing. I note the latest build notes say '10% Physical damage' I am hoping this equates to a 5% or so drop in real DPS. I can't imagine it could mean a 10% drop as that would be too Draconian.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for reading this.</div></div><hr />

Every minor PTR change that Blizzard tries to test turns into a raging QQ from said class(es) until Ghostcrawler shows up and points out the obvious that it's called &quot;Public Test Realm&quot; because they are testing stuff.

LoL, and its ppl like you posting graphs like these on official forums. OFC DK has highest activity! Its a new class, and everyone wants to try em out.<br />
Its logical Rogue activity has gone down. After the nerf they stopped trying. Believe me Rogues are very valid for Arena.<br />
<br />
Same for Paladin and Hunter. They got buffed and can finally compete in Arena, unlike 4 previous seasons. It only makes scense that more Hunters and Paladins are playing now.<br />
<br />
Show these graphs again over another 6 months, and maybe then you'll convince me Rogues are really bad.</div></div><hr />

Actually it's a bit worse than that, you also loose the main benefit of Heroic Strike Glyph (it doesn't give back any rage anymore), and yet another nerf has been made on the bersker stance (increases strengh instead of ap...) sooo the loss is about 20%. Our fury went from about 4k on boss model on live to 1k8 on PTR. On live on Patch he does about 6k2 dps. Premonition warriors on PTR dps for about 5k dps, which is roughly 1 to 2k dps less.<br />
So be thankful you juste like the game, not the dps rankings, because you won't be getting much of those :p</div></div><hr />
