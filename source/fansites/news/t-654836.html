A lot of people suspected there was something wrong with the kill of Yogg+0 by Exodus a few days ago. They were right and Exodus (http://www.exo-guild.com/) has been banned for exploiting a bug in this fight. Obviously, their kill has been removed from the Hall of Fame (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=864).<br />
<br />
Offense: Abuse of Game Mechanics<br />
Details: Circumvention of normal combat mechanics to defeat the Yogg-Saron encounter inside the Ulduar raid instance.<br />
<br />
In our many attempts at trying to figure out a way to defeat Yogg zero watcher, we found a way to use bugged game mechanics to make phase 3 easier in zero watcher then one watcher.<br />
<br />
The bug is when someone is left inside the brain room of Yogg-Saron, they can still get aggro on the adds that spawn in phase 3. That means if you have someone getting healing aggro in the brain room, they will get aggro on the adds, which cause them to evade in place and allows for all of your raids dps to be focused on Yogg.<br />
<br />
We discovered this mechanic on a wipe, and decided to see if we could actually get it to work. The first attempt after that wipe, we realized it worked, and went with it and killed it on that attempt.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This bug has been hotfixed on all servers. <br />
Immortal Guardians are now able to target players in the &quot;illusion room&quot; of Yogg-Saron with their summoning ability. This hotfix has been fully deployed to all regions.<br />
<br />
We're also in the process of deploying a hotfix for an issue with Immortal Guardians that could cause them to pause their movement before reaching melee range. This fix will also prevent the Immortal Guardian from running away if their target is stunned.</div></div><hr />

Just to make clear i don't agree they shouldn't get punished, but a bann c'mon...make a instance that does not have a bug on each boss.<br />
Next instance guilds will be so scared to even make a shot for Realm/World first because &quot;someone&quot; will just randomly acuse them of exploiting.<br />
<br />
Also i agree on the fact it is not fair Nihilum/Ensidia never got banned for their exploiting on bosses in the past.<br />

We wouldn't have had to use this technique to kill this encounter if it was actually killable to begin with, so please, Blizzard, make your encounters killable in the future. Lets take a moment to think about the other encounter that was deemed not killable mathematically in Ulduar.. Oh yeah 2min Hodir, I remember a certain guild killing it in this state by using an exploit.. they were not banned, any reason why Blizzard?<br />
<br />
First off I just want to say, if I was given the chance to erase history and do it again I would without question do it. These last 72+ hours watching Ensidia cry &quot;Exploit!&quot; and bitch non-stop have been absolutely hilarious. You guys are like a lot of other little european babies, who lack sportsmanship. Pretty sure when you guys exploited your way through this instance and past instances, my guild didn't cry non-stop until you were banned. Pot calling the kettle black?<br />
<br />
What about when you guys exploited Freya trash to kill Hodir? Not only that, but then you proceeded to e-mail your Blizzard contacts and had it hoxfixed before anyone even knew that you exploited it in this manner. This allowed for you to focus on more fights with your new 239 ilvl items that you got from exploited a kill, while everyone else was holding their dicks because you exploited and got the exploit fixed the same day.<br />

No, it only became common knowledge in the communiy AFTER they were banned... also it was very different, as Overrated modified the game files in order to exploit AQ40... whereas Exodus abused the game's mechanics.<br />
<br />
@Gammer: You shouldn't care so much about Ensidia...<br />
<br />
1 - pretty much no one likes them, why try to be like them ?<br />
2 - most people know they would do whatever it takes to be able to say 'we did it first', though most people aren't really interested;<br />
3 - by being a guild of 'ordinary people' you guys will gather much more interest from the community, since they are able to relate to what you do on raids... whereas everyone knows we can't compare ourselves to Ensidia because they spend their whole day on wow - it's what they do for a living.<br />
4 - pointing fingers is simply silly and everyone has been joking about Ensidia doing that... why the hell do the same ? Let's just forget about them and enjoy the game...</div></div><hr />

What was that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone on WoWHead explains this well:<br />
<br />
<br />
Quoted from -Removed-:<br />
<br />
In the worst kept secret in the game department, there's an exploit involving the rare non-combat pet oozling. As part of its cute properties, the oozling casts a minor debuff on you. Sounds harmless, right? Well, the thing is that you can make a macro that activates the oozling quickly thirty-two times, summoning and dismissing it in rapid succession. Doing so so quickly, you end up with 16 oozling debuffs on you, which pushes off any other debuff on you. Priest and warlock dots on you? Gone. Mortal Strike on you? Gone. Crippling poison? Gone.<br />
<br />
The biggest place where this comes into play is on the C'Thun encounter. During phase 2 of the encounter, people get swallowed up into C'Thun's belly. Inside the belly, there are two tentacles that you have to kill to make C'Thun vulnerable to attack outside. However, when you're inside the stomach, you get a stacking dot that gradually ramps up to the point that it would kill you very quickly, so normally players who get swallowed only get a short time to lay as much damage on the tentacles as possible before they have to leave the stomach. However, someone with the oozling can just knock off the stomach acid debuff, stay in the stomach indefinitely, burn through the tentacles in rapid succession, and make the C'Thun encounter almost trivial for the people outside the stomach as C'Thun goes vulnerable far more often than he would normally.<br />
<br />
This exploit has been known and around for a long time. In fact, the first world C'Thun kill shot has an oozling macro on the guy's hotbar. I've been queasy about reporting this bug here in that I didn't want to encourage more people to use the exploit, but it's so well known now -- and some people aren't even bashful about it -- that it seemed silly to hold back on the information any longer. I can't understand why Blizzard hasn't hotfixed such a major exploit, especially when it's being used so commonly to beat the biggest baddest boss in the game. All they have to do is remove the oozling debuff temporarily until they get their better debuff system put in place. <br />
<br />
So seems this little bugger played a big part back in the day.<br />
<br />
However, this exploit became obsolete with the small pet changes in 3.0.</div></div><hr />

The Disgusting Oozeling gave (and still does I think) the owner a debuff, a macro could be made to switch the debuff on and off 32 times, and that would dispell any other debuffs. So when someone got in the stomach of C'thun, they had as much time as they needed, seeing as they weren't affected by the debuff.</div></div><hr />

When ever someone accused them of exploiting, they never replied saying that it was a legit kill.<br />

Can you be sure though, that if Exodus weren't the first, that Ensidia wouldn't have exploited it themselves and report it after the kill like in Hodir's case? :P I know, an endless debate, but there are tons of &quot;what if's&quot; in this whole drama and imo it was just a matter of who did it first.</div></div><hr />

The exploits are not the same, please get that into your thick skulls. <br />
<br />
For one, why Ensidia didn't get banned for Hodir, was probably becuse blizzard realised they fucked up when they changed Hodir AFTER the race had started, y'know, making him impossible and all.<br />
<br />
Secondly: They actually had balls, admitted that they abused Pollinate right off the bat. They didn't seek more E-fame like some desperate, cellardwelling, stuckup retards.<br />

Quite certain they wouldn't have. They abused the flower buff on hodir becuse it had already been killed, and then buffed afterwards. Which is also why they probably didn't even get a warning, due to blizzard admitting fucking up the PvE race.<br />

I don't think they decided to report it instead of publishing it because they didn't want anyone else to use it, I think it's more because of how exploiting a bug is bad, but telling the whole world how to do it too is much worse, and they probably didn't want to risk a longer ban.<br />

Don't mistake clarification of facts for defense. I don't take any sides in this. In fact, I was among those who believed ensidia were simply being butthurt(and being made to eat my words now, ha.) All I did was correct someone who said that ensidia only confessed to flower power after blizzard found out, which is untrue, as blizzard found out because ensidia used and reported it to them.<br />
<br />
On whether they were justified, i will not say, but it did screw up the progression race by making the fight literally impossible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few people have mentioned that Ensidia gets paid to play WoW, so they have the resources (time, money, etc) to do the 'miraculous' things they do. I don't find this 'awesome' in any ways. If a competent group of 25 people in any country were under these circumstances, then they'd get the first kills.<br />
<br />
Someone else mentioned that this isn't as interesting as a 'real' guild getting the kill down. I completely agree with this. Hearing that a professional runner wins a marathon isn't all that exciting. Hearing someone who has a full career and runs for the passion has won, way better story. <br />
<br />
Ensidia has exploited before. You can try to justify it in any way you want in either direction, but an exploit is an exploit. Is it wrong if someone steals a car? What if someone just steals a pack of gum? Either way, no matter the scale, it's still stealing. <br />
<br />
Exodus should have seen this coming. They knew they were using an exploit, but tried to hide it. They should have just admitted to it and hoped that Blizzard allowed them to keep their kill. <br />
<br />
/end review</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because using an existing spell to gain an existing buff is exactly the same as evade-bugging the encounter and making the entire thing trivial.<br />
<br />
If I remember correctly, not only was Ensidia PISSED that they had to do that to even come close to the kill, they managed to pull it off with like.. less than a second left on the timer, to boot. Not trivial at all.<br />
<br />
Unlike Exodus, which first LIED and said that they were lucky (obviously not, P3 becomes tank/spank if you're not dealing with a single add), then proceeded to RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGE when they were caught. Cheating. Hands down. And lying. Hands down.<br />
<br />

I don't take any sides in this. In fact, I was among those who believed ensidia were simply being butthurt(and being made to eat my words now, ha.) All I did was correct someone who said that ensidia only confessed to flower power after blizzard found out, which is untrue, as blizzard found out because ensidia used and reported it to them.<br />
<br />
On whether they were justified, i will not say, but it did screw up the progression race by making the fight literally impossible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good point. My apologies friend = )</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astyan</div><div class="date">2009-06-30, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand why people are upset and angry at Ensidia, especially coming from the US.<br />
<br />
But let's have a look at the whole banning thing. You claim Ensidia should now be retroactively banned for using Flower Power on Hodir HM, so that the whole thing is fair.<br />
<br />
Now,<br />
<br />
1. Ensidia may have benefited from the fact that the exploit was fixed right after their kill, but they did immediately report it, which is totally different than claiming a World First for an achievement that was proved impossible to accomplish, and stick to it for days. It was pure hypocrisy on behalf of Ensidia, BUT they never ever pretended their kill to be legit, and they were even saying it was impossible before deciding to do it that way in order to keep going on HM, seeing how Blizzard wouldn't fix the encounter.<br />
<br />
2. When it comes to the &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot;, my judgment may be biased but I see quite a big difference between a Mage cleverly stealing a buff from a mob and using it to defeat a boss through hyper-inflated dps, and evading a whole bunch of deadly adds in order to totally trivialize an otherwise overly difficult encounter. Both are exploits, but while evading is purely a bug and an abuse of game mechanics, spell stealing remains in the realm of &quot;normal&quot; gaming, and is merely the result of an error on behalf of the development team.<br />
<br />
I think Exodus lied, refused to confess the lie, and made a much worse abuse of game mechanics than Ensidia for Hodir. Past actions from Nihilum then Ensidia are clearly questionable, but when it comes to Hodir HM, I don't think there should be any sanction now that Exodus is banned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hi, it's totally our fault we cheated to get the world first on the impossible encounter but we would first like to shift the fault to Blizzard for making an impossible encounter. Before I continue, I'd like to also divert your attention to the guild that exploited Hodir that got away from it. Though, unlike us, where we bragged about having the perfect execution and luck granted by the gods, they did report the bug. <br />
<br />
If we were given the chance again, we'd still totally do it because it was so funny to see people crying &quot;Exploit!&quot; when we actually did exploit the encounter. I'd also like to point out that all you Europeans out there are crybabies without sportsmanship just because we hate Ensidia for beating us to world firsts. <br />
<br />
&lt;Insert more claims that Ensidia exploited here (without actual proofs)&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;Insert more claims that Blizzard is siding EU (without actual proofs)&gt;<br />

<br />
First I'd like to say I'm an American. I don't feel effected by this at all, one guild made a fatal mistake and got punished for it. However the biggest mistake I see is not the fact they exploited. It is the fact they chose to turn this into a USA vs. Euro fight. In the end we are all gamers we are all people and that should not be effected by where we live.<br />
<br />
I feel that one guilds mistake is flaming off into people's view of my country. This guild made a mistake and is being punished for it. However all americans aren't cheaters looking for the next exploit. We are here to have fun.<br />
<br />
So I'll end and say......<br />

Oh wait.<br />

I will not make any claims for Ensidia's past transgressions (other than the fact the the Hodir 'exploit' is far and away less significant than evade-bugging an encounter in order to beat it), but Exodus did this by themselves, totally on their own. What's worse, and I can't overstate this, is they fed a bald-faced lie to the community about how they did it, obviously thinking they would somehow not be caught.</div></div><hr />

Ensidia uses double judgment bug on mimiron: Its fine (yes, it was a double judgment bug abused, seeing as how you would judge wisdom and light with 2 paladins, and not double light. Yes it was 2 different paladins since in the combat text on the video you can see the name of 2 different paladins for JoL healing)<br />
I am unsure about the torch bug for twins, but the fact that there was no video is quite odd.<br />
Then there is of course the 500k shield slam on vashj... clearly legit claim to world first.<br />
Exodus uses a bug (hay guiz, I was just stuck in here healing a warlock we didnt mean to evade bug srsly!): Immediate suspension<br />
<br />
The only boss that they admitted to abusing is hodir, and they only told blizzard AFTER they killed it. There is clear favoritism from blizzard, and it is disgusting.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nudge</div><div class="date">2009-06-30, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It gets better, however, when Ensidia states on their forums:<br />
<br />
&quot;We found the exploit that makes phase 3 a tank and spank and the easiest phase of the whole fight almost instantly (its so easy to pull off, im suprised it took this long for a guild to use it), of course we arent going to kill it like that&quot; -Zemme of Ensidia<br />
<br />
Now, I respect Ensidia as a guild and all but this just reeks of irony considering they blatantly exploited Hodir and attempted to effectively burn the bridge for everyone else by reporting the bug right after; whether they'll admit that this was their angle is another story. Zemme repeatedly attempts to justify this on their guild forums by differentiating the types of exploits and claiming that theirs was much less severe and how spell-stealing the Pollinate buff on each of their mages stacking up to 10 times each for 250% damage bonus resulting in 40k DPS doesn't trivialize an encounter like evading Yogg adds. Good joke.<br />

i doubt it, i think they though just to get away with it.<br />

I dont give a shit about ensidia, i admire guilds who have a regular player base and manage to kill bosses fast however (guilds who kill the stuff as 10th-20th guilds etc)<br />
anyway, to the point.<br />
<br />
Whoever uses a huge bug as this and then pretent they killed it the way its intended, sorry, but c'mon.<br />

and that USA vs Europe stuff, can you go any lower? this stuff is getting worse and worse lately and making a fool out ur self, doesnt help preventing this.<br />

On topic: Exodus deserved the suspension, but Ensidia deserved it much earlier. And still haven't got suspended despite the &quot;use of clever game mechanics&quot;. I really dont care about who's better between this stupid US vs EU shit. But for Ensidia to cry to high heavens because they weren't &quot;World First&quot; is just a bunch of flexing your e-peen. Both guilds could've handled the situation in a more mature manner than they did.</div></div><hr />

Something tells me, the drama on MMOChamp PALES in comparison to what is happening in the echelons of Exodus right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty much this. How many (if any) people objected to using the exploit before the kill attempt, and are now royally pissed that it's blown up in their face? How many are going to leave now because their guild name is basically trashed?<br />
<br />
The most vocal members may be putting on a &quot;we don't care lawl USA!&quot; front, but I'd imagine that there's an equally large part of the guild that isn't very happy right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
And as far as the &quot;they make USA look bad&quot; crap...garbage. The US still has some very good guilds. Exodus used an exploit to get a world first, lied about it, and when caught, shifted the blame to Ensdia, Blizzard and anyone else but themselves. They're tools, and they only people they've made look bad is themselves.</div></div><hr />

Spellsteal buff is hardly an evade-bug exploit, and Ensidia already knew of this evade-bug exploit before the kill was downed by Exodus - and yet didn't follow through with it.<br />
<br />
In any case, the ban is wholly deserved, as is the removal of any loot/achievements.All of this would be wonderful, if Exodus had said outright 'the only way we were able to beat this was by evade-bugging it.' But they didn't. They claimed it was all god-given luck and skill.<br />
<br />
Like I said, exodus deserves the suspension. And the JoL bug is pretty easy to do when you raid with near lan latency like ensidia. It also HAS to be intended because it happened for more than half of the fight. Considering around 4 minutes of uptime on it when its got a 20 sec duration... thats quite impressive luck! There is also the fact that you would have at least 1 paladin judge wisdom in such a long fight to help improve DPS of the raid...<br />
<br />
If ensidia knew of the bug for yogg for so long... WHY NOT REPORT IT?</div></div><hr />

exodus deserved the ban, but so did ensidia and nihilum everytime they did exploit game mechanics in a boss fight.<br />
72h suspensions would have been fine, but doing NOTHING is just wrong. it's like ensidia isn't even trying to play legit.<br />
<br />
so blizzard made an unbeatable boss... now what?<br />
you don't have the right to kill it, if it is unkillable.<br />
just live with the fact that you'll have to be patient and will not be able to kill the boss right now.<br />
blizzard didn't do anything wrong, but the exploiters did.<br />
in fact, it is extremely offensive, childish and dumb to blame blizzard even though YOU cheated.<br />

so i'm playing monopoly and because parker brothers won't le me build a second hotel on park lane, i'll just take away a hotel from whitechapel road and put it on park lane, chargin twice the cost for every player.<br />

Flower power was clever use of game mechanics that didnt take the difficulty out of the fight, it just added a buff to the players. Plus ensidia automaticaly reported it while exodus lied about it. <br />

This is the big difference between the Ensidia's Hodir kill and Exodus' Yogg Saron kill.<br />
<br />
During the first week Hodir was successfully killed, on his hard mode (3 minutes) and harder mode (2:30) by 2 kills. This meant that they had a boss down towards Algalon.<br />
Blizzard, for whatever reason, then chose to make the encounter harder. This effectively locked all guilds except for the 2 to get it in the first week out of Algalon. <br />
<br />
Ensidia's basic reply was: &quot;We are going to break this boss and Blizzard is not going to get us out of having a fair shot at Algalon&quot;. <br />
<br />
They then proceeded to break Hodir. By 0.06 of a second. The beat the hard and harder mode timers without the buff. <br />
<br />
Yogg Saron with 0 Watchers has not changed since Ulduar was released. Nobody had killed it before. It had not been done.<br />
<br />
Exodus used a cheat to get the World First. That is the issue.</div></div><hr />

Exodus congrats for the few days off. Feel free to see how life is outside for a change. If there were some in guild who disagree with the fact that their guild exploited they should just look at the bright side of a few days of variety.<br />

Now then, I'm from the U.S. and its true, the vast majority of us, or the ones that are publicized are completely immature, moronic and indecent people. Exodus did what they thought was a legit kill, or just did it because, and they got banned for it, and it was rightly deserved.<br />
<br />
Evading mobs to trivialize an encounter is an exploit of the most devious proportions and Blizzard had every right to ban them permanently, but they softened the blow to the U.S. by making it only a seventy-two hour suspension. Exodus should have known from the get go that what they were doing was a bannable offense and doing so would be unintelligent.<br />
<br />
To all those that claim Ensidia should also be banned for what they have done in the past, Ensidia's previous expansion world firsts (Nihilum and SK gaming) that are questionable, are so far in the past that banning based on those would be purposeless. The hard mode of Hodir from this expansion though, some still question. There is an enormous difference between using a readily available resource, albeit unintended, and forcing mobs to evade during the supposed hardest phase of the encounter, turned easiest. As for the Mage that got banned utilizing the same idea of spellstealing buffs, the difference here is the bosses weren't impossible to kill, and that Mage solo'd it.<br />
<br />
Again, the U.S. isn't completely full of people that give us that horrible image and reputation, you just have to look a little deeper beneath the surface to find decent people.</div></div><hr />

They should have the rewards stripped but banning someone because they took advantage of something that's the developers fault is no reason to ban.<br />
<br />
It's like banning someone for calling you out on you're own sloppy mistake.<br />
<br />
But what should we expect, blizzard is a sell out for the masses. Just wanting to make more money (Not that they were not making enough as it is) what they dont realize is they will probably make less money over time with a alot of thier loyal costumers quitting instead of new ones who will play a few months and quit.<br />

<br />
I'm from the United States, and even I can say that what they did was an absolute disgrace. It's because of this, that the US is under such scrutiny, so often.<br />
<br />
Please, not all Americans are like the people that post here. Intellectual, down-to-earth and reasonable people still reside here. They're just hard to find.<br />

Exodus killing YS0 is now in the past, and therefore should not be further discussed. They are top in the world now since they completed the encounter. Or wait, is there a statute of limitations on this sort of thing that would conveniently make it so that Ensidia/Nihilum is immune but Exodus can still be punished? I bet there are...<br />
<br />
While I don't believe Ensidia would have exploited the encounter in this fashion, if there were a more subtle way of doing it, they without a doubt would have. The only thing preventing them from doing this to get another world first is the blatant obviousness of it and the backlash which you can see is occuring right now. If this bug was instead something like being able to kill the guardians by some sort of placement or spellstealing a buff that allows you to do 8k dps, Ensidia would have this encounter downed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... and that would've been fine, assuming they admitted it, because the argument about YS0 seems to always have been &quot;we cannot do the damage fast enough&quot;. This was also the issue on Hodir and nothing happened to Ensidia because they didn't make a key fight mechanic nonexistent (e.g. they didn't stop Flash Freeze being cast); they just made their dps harder. That's all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When Ensidia exploited Hodir, <br />
<br />
a) they weren't a world first &amp;<br />
b) they denied nothing &amp; even publicly announced how they did it.<br />
<br />
Exodus said &quot;they got lucky&quot; and that they didn't have any bugs or anything. Evading a mob is bugging the encounter therefore they deserved what they got.<br />
<br />
Using a buff from a spellsteal to defeat a boss isn't an exploit.<br />
Making an encounter trivial by bug-evading the mobs which are meant to sit at 1% battering everyone in the raid is an exploit.<br />
<br />
If you can't work that out then you're clearly stuck in the World that is Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

Well, my point went completely over your head.<br />

This was all in a recent timescale. From the MOMENT THAT THEY KILLED YOGG+0, this entire ordeal has been under investigation by almost everybody. To apply my point to something, that by definition in the past, but not the issue itself, is just semantics.<br />

PS: Considering the bulk of hodir is easy, and the only hard part was the timer, getting a buff that gives you 40k+ dps is indeed trivializing the encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know about the other encounters as I haven't looked them up but considering they only managed to defeat Hodir with seconds to spare on the enrage it is pretty clear that there isn't really any other way it can be done.<br />
<br />
Yogg-Saron however was never deisgned for someone to bug-evade the mobs. That's the whole idea of not having the keepers there, thus the mobs staying at 1% and making it stupidly hard. There is no comparison to this and Hodir. With Hodir they still had everything else around happening as normal. The only key difference is that they had to find more dps from somewhere to beat the timer. They did this by using a spell that ALL mages have and taking a buff that was clearly stealable and used it to help them. If you can see something wrong with that you may as well remove spell steal from all mages.</div></div><hr />

WHo said anything about retroactively banning ensidia? The point is that Exodus shouldn't get banned. (or lose their world first for it) Ensidia has done it and nothing happened, but a less well known guild does it an gets banned. Its a double standard and its just plain stupid.<br />

Big difference was the fact that it was a single person doing that. That and did the person actually report his findings?<br />
If you find any exploits and then use them to your own advantage and don't tell anyone then expect the worst.<br />

Last I checked, the first 70% of the fight remained just as difficult. C'thun bug took out an entire aspect of the encounter, as it let them stay inside to kill tentacles without taking the usual damage debuff (imagine doing yogg except you never have to leave the brain). Vashj, supposedly some bug happened that took off 50% of her health (they claim shield slam bugged and crit her for 500k). And many others.</div></div><hr />

Incorret. Even with the buff they managed to beat the timer by 0.06 seconds (e.g. The timer was at 1:59.94 when Hodir went friendly). The buff wasn't significant enough to make the entire mechanic irrelevant.<br />

<br />
Ensidia(Nihilum) has done similar things in the past. True.<br />
<br />
We can argue all day that Ensidia's exploits were 'not' cheating, whereas Exodus was 'clearly' cheating. AFAIC, theres no point. Blizzard has shown a profound favoritism towards Nihilum for years. Nothing can or will change that.<br />

<br />
And anyone saying &quot;QQ OMG ENSIDIA EXPLOITED HODIR!&quot; plz look at the facts. The timer was originally 3mins, something they could have done in their sleep. Then it was 2:30, a lil more challeging but still very manageable. Then it got put to 2 minutes after plenty of guilds had already gotten the achievement and were able to progress further on Alg. 2 minutes was impossible. It wasnt fair to them to let guilds get the achievement and then make it impossible when they attempt it. The only reasons why the used it was so they could progress on, and not be cock blocked while other guilds had done it. And they wrote blizzard after for the hope that theyd change it, not so other guilds couldnt do it. Hardly any other guild would have been able to do it even with flower power.<br />
<br />
I'm from US and im genuinely embarrassed by all of the EPIC FAIL from the US posters. I dont care about EU vs US, all i care about is facts. Exodus is fail on so many lvls and they do belong in the hall of shame<br />
<br />
Maybe Nihilum used some exploits on C'Thun and Twins, but that really seems irrelevant doesnt it? Are you trying to say its their fault that blizzard didnt ban them?</div></div><hr />

That's corroborates what one of the Ensidia members said in this thread: http://www.ensidia.com/community/post/2265/?page=88#25793 about the Vashj kill. They didn't bother with a legitimate kill because everyone was just so damn sick of the boss. Next time please post that at the beginning instead of random crap :)</div></div><hr />

A exploit removes a certain aspect from a fight (like the guardians in the Yog fight) where as using a buff in a place it wasn't meant to be at first is just using something at your disposal.<br />
<br />
Kind of like mind controlling void reaver trash to stack the armor debuff on him (got hotfixed of course).<br />
The oozeling is a exploit but that was what... 3 to 4 years ago? Blizzard isn't allowed to change their minds about these kinds of things over the course of several years? :P</div></div><hr />

Even if they didn't intend for her to drop to 1 HP, they took advantage of the bug by killing Vashj in the manner at which they did. It, any way you look at it, is an exploit. Did they have to use the SS when they saw Vashj reset to 1 HP and use shadow word death, no. Did they, YES. Exploit any way you look at it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aleom</div><div class="date">2009-06-30, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to jump in here and pose a question that I think would solve this Hodir/Flower Power discussion, or at least shed some light on it from a different angle. <br />
<br />
For those who do not know what that event is referring to (although most here do) The exploit/not exploit they are speaking of is when Ensidia kited mobs from Freya trash into Hodir's room, then spellstole the Flower Power buff from them to their 8 mages in ordeer to INSANELY increase their DPS output to reach the 2 minute timer. <br />
<br />
Blizzard's stance was that this was not an exploit but rather a &quot;clever use of in-game mechanics.&quot; (Despite the fact that the same use of in-game mechanics got mages banned when they did it in Naxx but whatever...) Some people claim this trick was not an exploit, others do. An easy way to test this would be to ask yourself this question: <br />
<br />
If the Flower Power trick was done to any other boss, would it still be considered clever? Or be considered an exploit?<br />
<br />
Just two examples:<br />
Freya: Flower Power on Freya with the 8 mages would be putting out MORE than enough DPS that it would make her healing regen buff completely irrelevant, thus circumventing the normal design of the fight to beat her. <br />
Iron Council: It would be quite the kite, but if you walked into Iron Council with the Flower Power debuff, you could easily have nuked the three bosses in Hardmode order. In fact, Steelbreaker would probably have died so fast, the raid would have circumvented the hard part of the encouter: the tank death.<br />
<br />
Had Flower Power been used on any other boss fight BESIDES the two minute Hodir, I'm convinced that Blizzard would have been singing a different tune about their &quot;in-game mechanics.&quot;<br />
<br />
Afterall, we need look no further than when Mages were spellstealing Bone Armor in Naxx. Spell-stealing a buff, using the buff to increase DPS on bosses...sounds very familiar except one gets the ban and one is called &quot;clever.&quot; <br />
<br />
I think we can at least agree that Blizzard's stance on what is or is not an exploit depends on how they feel that day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me clarify the diffrence becuse you're obviously not getting it:<br />
<br />
You're fighting a boss, any boss, it bugs out and drops to 1% Hp, but the raid didn't die. Whops, due to a boss bug you didn't know about, you killed the boss, exploit.<br />
<br />
It's abit diffrent here but it applies, if they didn't intended for the Hp drop to happen it was an error on Blizzards behalf, not on the raids end.<br />
<br />
Either way it's pointless to argue as it took place years ago and it won't change anything Exodus did this previous friday. It won't redeem them, make them look any less stupid or arrogant, nor will I get Ensidia banned. <br />
<br />
I suggest something new and fresh: leave it up to Blizzard to decide punishment. They're 'sadly' all powerfull when it comes to these kind of events, either accept what they do or quit, becuse it won't change. Ensidia didn't get banned, Exodus did, therefor I draw the conclusion that there was infact something diffrent between those two scenarios, and that you should accept it, or ofcourse quit in a moment of nerdrage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one would have cared half as much and they did. This is basically what Ensidia said with Hodir and the encounter was fixed and they continued progression without a suspension. No the fights were not the same as Ensidia didn't cause mobs to Evade making them a non-factor in the fight, but it is principle. Just don't lie about accomplishments and say that &quot;we just got lucky.&quot; That is a blatant lie and that is why all the flaming has happened. Be honest and no one will care.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand you completely in that that they didn't intend for the HP to drop. My point is simply this, boss bugs as they die and they use DI for wipe protection. As you can see clearly from the combat log, the priest used his SS and killed the boss while it was bugged. This was an intentional exploit of the bug. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying they should have been banned, not saying exodus shouldn't have been. Blizzard is all powerful, I'm simply saying that they have, in the past, taken advantage of a bug in game to get a kill. <br />
<br />
Let me re-iterate, they didn't expect the bug to happen, but when it did, used it to their advantage. Thus, exploit.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if I would call it an exploit, even tho it is, but you gotta admit there's a giant diffrence. The shadowpriest in question had a short ammount of time to react and I doubt any information was passed between the DI bug happening and the shadowpriest using the soulstone. He saw a window to escape an endless wipefest on a bugged to bits encounter and took it, so in reality, the shadowpriest exploited but it wasn't a guild decision like in the case of Exodus and Yogg+0.<br />
<br />
It's semantics I know, but I atleast doubt I'm wrong when I say that the two scenarios were diffrent. As a weakass reallife example, there's manslaugther and there's murder, one has a weaker penalty.</div></div><hr />

This. The single biggest problem was that they claimed the kill to be legit and when they had no proof to back it when they always show it, people started suspecting something's amiss. All they would have to do is go &quot;yeah, we killed him, math showed that legit kill is impossible, we found a bug and killed it, we reported the bug&quot; and things would be over right there and then. One lie messed it all up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
It wasn't just Ensidia in this. You have to understand that by taking &quot;this kill was legit&quot; stance, Exodus backed a few very powerful players into corner - endgame guilds were trying to figure out just what the hell happened, EJ mathematicians were 100% sure of their math, etc. Something's bound to backfire in such a situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can agree that there is a difference to what ensidia did vs. what exodus did. Regardless of the mindset of the priest in question, the exploited kill should have been handled in some way by blizzard. To my knowledge however, nothing was done about it. And to go with your &quot;weakass&quot; which is actually a good example, there are penalties in both manslaughter and murder, one is in fact weaker but there is a penalty none the less. Restated, to my knowledge, no action was taken on ensidia, or the priest in question.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I rather trust blizzard to do what's right, atleast they probably aren't biased, than anyone on this forum.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree, Blizzard has little to gain from being biased so they're the best judges. I'm simply stating that, due to many of the examples posted and what they consider to be or not to be an exploit has been rather inconsistent. <br />
<br />
But let's do that exercise and look at some surrounding circumstances in many cases, here's just a few examples:<br />
<br />
Flower Power on 2 minute Hodir ---- Considered not an Exploit<br />
Flower Power on (say) Freya, or Iron Council --- I'd wager it would be considered an exploit, but that's just me.<br />
<br />
Bone Armor solo of Military Wing --- Considered an Exploit<br />
A mage or two, in a full raid, spellstealing Bone Armor to increase their DPS --- I don't believe this should be considered an exploit as this event is identical to that of a raid of 8 mages with FP for 2-minute Hodir which is entirely acceptable.<br />
<br />
If (if) we agree that Flower Power on any other Ulduar boss would be considered an exploit, then that would make little sense for Hodir to be an exception. The same way that we would say a mage soloing Military quarter is an exploit, but the exception to that rule would logically be if he was just doing it in a normal raid environment. I don't think Blizzard would agree with me there, which, again, makes be believe their &quot;rule sets&quot; for determining exploits involves some form of archaic Alchemy and possible virgin sacrifices...</div></div><hr />

Here is what it sound like to me.<br />
<br />
Scenario1 <br />
<br />
A man is taken to court for being a sex offender.<br />
While the man is explaining the reason he preys on kid and why he did it, he thinks to himself and says &quot; mhm i feel good now that i took that off my chest.<br />
The Judge then says that was quite brave of you for being honest. <br />
So the judge decide that the man should just go on free without any punishment because he admitted the truth.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Completely different scale. How in the world can you compare sex offenses to a video game?<br />

Regardless of the mindset of the priest in question, the exploited kill should have been handled in some way by blizzard. To my knowledge however, nothing was done about it. And to go with your &quot;weakass&quot; which is actually a good example, there are penalties in both manslaughter and murder, one is in fact weaker but there is a penalty none the less. Restated, to my knowledge, no action was taken on ensidia, or the priest in question.<br />
<br />
<br />
With this, I agree. But you also have to consider that Blizzard themselfs knew at that point that the encounter was bugged to hell, and that's probably why no actions were taken.<br />
<br />
I like to belive that the same can be applied to Hodir hardmode, Blizzard, without saying anything ofcourse, admitted a fuckup on how it was done, and spared Ensidia due to how much attention the endgame PvE race brings to the game and their new content.<br />
<br />
Yoggsaron+0 is another example of where an encounter is impossible but made possible by using a bug. Now, you could claim that for that reason alone, Exodus should be spared. They did however try to pass it off as a legit kill, probably without even reporting it, which surely has an effect on the punishment.<br />
<br />
There are also cases where people charged with manslaughter has walked away, nearly without punishment. They are few however and it requires quite special circumstances, but it has happend. I think it tends to be called justifiable homicide.</div></div><hr />

Telling Blizzard about it rather than everyone is a much better thing to do to avoid having other people exploiting it. Makes less work for Blizzard too. Part of me wants to say they should have said something on their website about it, but I really don't understand how they could have said anything without revealing that there was in fact an exploit. Then having a bunch of other people go out and try to find said exploit, some being successful, and creating more work for Blizzard's banhammer. <br />
<br />
No idea if Exodus' comments about Ensidia cheating are true, but if so I guess there is no honor left in rai...yeah I can't even say that without laughing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, I do NOT think they should have been banned at all. They should hotfix it, let them keep their title and mount. Creative use of game mechanics.<br />
<br />
If they are going to ban people, they should take a MUCH harder look at Ensidia and a number of other guilds, as there seems to be at the very least rampant speculation going on that there has been a history of exploiting.<br />
<br />
And for fark sakes, who cares what country any of these people are from.</div></div><hr />

Your completely missing the point,<br />
The point is that even if the person does something wrong and admits it that they should still be punished for it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc1256561eea</div><div class="date">2009-06-30, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, Blizzard has little to gain from being biased so they're the best judges. I'm simply stating that, due to many of the examples posted and what they consider to be or not to be an exploit has been rather inconsistent. <br />
<br />
But let's do that exercise and look at some surrounding circumstances in many cases, here's just a few examples:<br />
<br />
Flower Power on 2 minute Hodir ---- Considered not an Exploit<br />
Flower Power on (say) Freya, or Iron Council --- I'd wager it would be considered an exploit, but that's just me.<br />
<br />
Bone Armor solo of Military Wing --- Considered an Exploit<br />
A mage or two, in a full raid, spellstealing Bone Armor to increase their DPS --- I don't believe this should be considered an exploit as this event is identical to that of a raid of 8 mages with FP for 2-minute Hodir which is entirely acceptable.<br />
<br />
If (if) we agree that Flower Power on any other Ulduar boss would be considered an exploit, then that would make little sense for Hodir to be an exception. The same way that we would say a mage soloing Military quarter is an exploit, but the exception to that rule would logically be if he was just doing it in a normal raid environment. I don't think Blizzard would agree with me there, which, again, makes be believe their &quot;rule sets&quot; for determining exploits involves some form of archaic Alchemy and possible virgin sacrifices... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are other factors that need be considered, I sadly have to repeat myself: Blizzard did fuck up on Hodir, made him an impossible cockblock after guilds had killed him. They probably had understanding for Ensidias action and therefor decided not to punish them for it.<br />
<br />
The spellstealing of Bone armor did not just increase a mages DPS, it made them immortal and capable of soloing bosses. Not the same playing field, it would be if the mages that spellstole the buff could've engaged Hodir alone and killed it, but as that wasn't the case, it's not in the same playing field.<br />
<br />
It's iffy, and no one can give complete answers to why guilds are treated diffrently, but I personally belive that Blizzard goes with a case by case standard when dealing with the PvE race, rather than the mass bannings of Leviathan+4.<br />
<br />
Either way, I'm fairly sure Blizzard isn't biased becuse Ensidia is sponsored. I doubt the Prince of Dubai or whatever/whoever the hell is sponsoring a computer game crew has the influence to affect Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Enjoyed the debate with you but there comes a time when it has to end. Unfortunately work will be calling before I can get much sleep so I need to jet. <br />
<br />
I leave you with the bolded text. According to the post on exodus' website, they indeed reported the bug. I however, cannot confirm nor deny that they did.<br />

Hopefully some sort of Blizzard response can shed some light on the grey area we call &quot;clever&quot; or &quot;abuse&quot; of game mechanics.</div></div><hr />

Yea, maybe they should've been, but they weren't. It's not up to us to call the shots, all we can do is speculate becuse Blizzard doesn't go offical about matters such as these.<br />
<br />
Trust in Blizzards ability to manage their own game and it's community, they're a respectable company with lots of credibility, there's no reason to accuse them of bias or bad calls unless you can somehow prove it, without knowing all the facts as you're an uninvolved observer.</div></div><hr />

In both cases, the exploits were used for a (in my opinion) legitimate reason. The encounters are impossible. Hodir as he was, without the Flower Power buff, was totally impossible, just as Yogg+0 is totally impossible without evade-bugging the adds.<br />
<br />
The difference is the way it was handled, and the factors beforehand. First off, the Hodir encounter had been buffed to impossible status... AFTER other guilds had already done it, thus destroying the fair progression of the 'race to world firsts,' which Blizzard has said they rather like. They were also quite pissed that they had to finish the encounter that way.<br />
<br />
In Exodus' case, they first claimed that they'd cleared it with a combination of god-given luck and amazing skill (that blog post will haunt them forever), and when they were caught, put up a bitchfest about it. That's the primary difference behind the reasons of the exploits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 encounter was made harder after being successfully beaten and locked people out of the race for one of the &quot;final&quot; progression bosses due to being made impossible without cheating.<br />
1 was designed to be practically impossible and it turned out they forgot to include the &quot;practically&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Has less to do with them being smart, and more to do with other guilds who found it in 10 minutes and decided they were above exploiting.</div></div><hr />

Yes, if you intend to run the fight to its normal length (dps through at least 15-16 mill p3 yogg hp) you will end up with that many adds.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget TBC where Nihilum (half of Ensidia) got the World First Vashj kill because she bugged and fell over dead when phase 3 started.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the next kill didn't come for 3-4 more months when she got nerfed to hell.</div></div><hr />

In theory, it's totally realistic. In Yogg+0, the Immortal Guardians are ACTUALLY immortal. You can get them down to minimum health, but they do not die, because Thorim is not there to finish off the last 1%.</div></div><hr />

I'm not an Ensidia fan boy and sometimes I dislike their way but I should say that there is a big difference between exploit and being clever.<br />
<br />
Using external buff (seasonal, mob buff, etc..) it's being clever, not an exploit.<br />
Kitting a mob or putting people in a particolar position is not an exploit.<br />
<br />
Bugging a mob till it &quot;evade&quot; it's an exploit.<br />
<br />
For istance Blizzard didn't banned Ensidia when they killed Hodir HM in 2 minute using external buff for 2 reasons:<br />
1) they simply used something acceptable inside the game (in fact blizzard simply put the timer back to 3min, it didn't removed that buff).<br />
2) they posted it instantly to blizz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been raiding since EQ days, including high end raid guilds in both EQ and WOW, some of which were top 10 in the world, does this surprise me none? no it dont.<br />
<br />
I honestly think GMs aid some guilds, I was in one that broke up back in Vanilla WOW into the TBC era that was like this, so apparently blizz GMs were watching over this or something?<br />
<br />
Exploiting happens every day, Botting as well, but the odds of getting something done about that seem slimmer then jim.<br />
<br />
I have little sympathy for many of the end game guilds in WOW today, mostly for this reason, others being jokers are always able to get in them with no problem outside the fact the game is built where bad players can bang their head against the wall for 15 hours a day for a month and eventually down something due to a little luck or less horse play during an encounter.<br />
<br />
Why Exodus stated they never be doing it again, because they wouldnt be able to in the first place unless they spend another 400 hours at it and they might get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
So this leaves me to the next question.<br />
<br />
<br />
But what does Blizz have against Exodus?<br />
<br />
Are they trying to get another guild the Yogg +0 kill 1st?</div></div><hr />

The above is just exodus being assholes. Its that simple, a couple members tried to pass it off as a legit kill.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;GMs watching&quot;. Devs watch alot of first kills, and even if they aren't watching they have logs of EVERYTHING. It was very easy for them to check if they were exploiting or not.</div></div><hr />

But if this ban was just today, why did it take blizzard a week or so to implement it?<br />

it dont see right for the fact its something exodus took advantage of in which the bug should of been hotfixed ages ago.<br />

I know what happens with 0 watchers I just thought the spawn rate would be slightly more forgiving... looking at the adds left during that fight you'll need 23 tanks 1 dpser and 1 healer for phase 3 O.o<br />

<br />
Exodus reported the bug to Blizzard after they killed Yogg. That's how Blizzard found out about it.<br />
<br />
Honestly, this ban irritates me a little bit. Far be it from me to say exploiting is right; it isn't. However, Blizzard should have better sense than to put an encounter into the game that is mathematically impossible. Couple with that, the fact that the bug was reported immediately after discovering it (despite the kill, and knowing that Ensidia did the same after killing Hodir in 2 min), and this seems like a harsh over-reaction on Blizzards part. People can try to discredit them all they want, Kaywarrior still has the mount to prove that they did it (or, at least, he's not said anything about them taking it away). To me, this exploit is simply a way to circumvent a mathematical impossibility, and I really don't think they deserved the ban. But, whatcha gonna do? The overlords have spoken...</div></div><hr />
