Glacial Tidestorm (https://www.wowdb.com/items/166705-glacial-tidestorm) will now only drop for players who have not acquired the mount previously (but it will remain tradeable).</div></div><hr />

So it wasn't working the same way the mount did for Mythic Gul'dan?</div></div><hr />

I bet Ian and his team would like to remove all water walking mounts from the game too.</div></div><hr />

Logic from a 12-year old. <br />

Just a hint: Not everything Blizzard does has to do with subs, Ian or especially YOU.</div></div><hr />

Wasting resources fixing issues? Jesus people really stretch for a reason to be mad at Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

There was no reason to remove all the portals they removed to start with. This was a &quot;bug&quot; they intentionally created. And I'm not mad, I'm amused.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, there was a reason. You just don’t like it so you choose to not acknowledge it. I don’t really care about the portals as it’s not that much of an inconvenice. Instead of going from a starting point to 1-2 other portals to get where I want to go, I now go from a starting point to 1-2 other areas to get where I want to go. The only portal removal that bothered me was CoT.<br />
Now you are saying they intentionally created a bug. Either your phrasing needs work or you literally think Blizzard made a problem just to have to fix it later. Since I hope you are smarter than that, I’m going to assume it’s a phrasing issue and point out that you are still wrong. They changed an in game design, that doesn’t mean they mean to cause a bug in the coding.<br />
I’m curious as to why you are amused. Are you not a fan of the game so you take pleasure in the company having to fix something so you can point out something wrong that happened or are you a fan that just takes a sadistic pleasure in something going wrong?</div></div><hr />

Neither one of you can prove one way or the other. You're countering his opinion with your own opinion.</div></div><hr />
