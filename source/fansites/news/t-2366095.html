Patch 7.3.5 PTR - Build 25848<br />
The latest PTR build flagged the client as a Release Candidate. <br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 7.3.5 - Artifact Instability<br />
Patch 7.3.5 adds the send off for our Artifact weapons (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7235-Patch-7-3-5-Artifact-Weapon-Ending-World-Changes-Command-Boards-New-Racial-Icons). A recent PTR build added some visual effects of the instability that results from the send off.<br />
<br />
The latest build also changed how the Artifact Power numbers increase or decrease once your Artifact is unstable. Now your Artifact will increase in (displayed) Artifact Power until February 2nd, then the total Artifact Power displayed will decrease until March 2nd. On March 19 it will begin to increase very very rapidly.<br />

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria: Pet Battles<br />
Pet Battles were added in Mists of Pandaria and are still around today. This new content allowed players to collect battle pets and face off against other players, trainers or battle pets. The initial design had some features such as certain pets only spawning under very specific conditions (i.e - time of day or weather). The basics of the system were a level 25 cap with 6 total abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Spell Animations in Patch 5.2<br />
Warlocks, Rogues and Monks got updated spell animations on this PTR build. The spells that were updated were Nimble Brew, Ring of Peace, Hit and Run, Marked for Death and Blood Fear. Some of these abilities, such as Ring of Peace, have been updated in later patches as well.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Swift Windsteed<br />
The newest addition to the Blizzard Store was the Swift Windsteed, which is the Pandaria themed mount floating on a cloud. As with all store mounts, this one scales with riding skill and is available to all characters on the account that purchase it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Chinese Gaming Theme Park<br />
China opened a theme park which featured a variety of gaming titles. In 2013, a Reddit user shared some pictures from their trip to the park, which had a few Warcraft and Starcraft features.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 6.1<br />
The first content patch of Warlords of Draenor brought small updates to a variety of systems as well as Twitter functionality within World of Warcraft. After the new character models were implemented, there were a few complaints which got fixed during this update. We also saw the addition of the Heirloom tab to make it easier to navigate and create heirlooms on alt characters. The Death Recap panel also got a small upgrade which made it easier to figure out what killed you during combat.<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 7.1.5<br />
The first major balance patch of Legion brought a large number of changes to the game. The most important was the increase of secondary stats on jewelry. Secondary stat amounts on jewelry were increased to make them have a larger overall impact on stats since jewelry doesn't have primary stats. This patch also brought two new pieces of content with the addition of Mists of Pandaria Timewalking and the return of the Brawlerâ€™s guild. Hunter traps and the Mage Barriers also got new animations to better fit the specs.<br />
<br />

A new patch (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2364653-Heroes-Of-The-Storm-Patch-Notes-%E2%80%94-January-9-2018) released for Heroes of the Storm on January 9th, 2018. Highlights include the introduction of Blaze (http://us.battle.net/heroes/en/heroes/blaze/), the new hero from Starcraft!<br />

Overwatch released a new patch (https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/game/patch-notes/pc/) on January 9th to go along with the start of the first stage of Season One for the Overwatch League (https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/) going on now through January 13th. The patch includes new skins for each hero with color schemes coordinating with the different competing teams.<br />

My guess is visual until BFA launch at which then, with the exception the ilvls provided by the relics socketed in them, they'll be completely depowered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They added more levels to the concordance buff. If the effects are to be true, it means that ap will be added to the weapon over time, then nerfed, then insanely increased. It the most logical sense, otherwise theres no reason for blizz to add more levels to the concordance buff. <br />
<br />
It makes sense, this is blizzards answer to nerfing the last tier like they always do each expansion near the end.<br />

<br />
Now your Artifact will increase in (displayed) Artifact Power until February 2nd, then the total Artifact Power displayed will decrease until March 2nd. On March 19 it will begin to increase very very rapidly.<br />
<br />
It will increase, decrease and then rapidly increase as it is unstable. You are not actually losing anything until Battle for Azeroth. Your traits will still be there.</div></div><hr />

It will still be there, but you can only access them during the last 2 months of a patch via grinding out the Talents Pathfinder achievement. And even then, the talents won't be available in all content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea it's beyond hilarious and depressing at the same time , this whole expansion was one BIG AP grind 24/7. They messed up so bad with this system..</div></div><hr />

<br />
And well... front page posts can't look too short unless it's super extra emergency announcement, I guess.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather just have the artifact weapons destroyed with a big boom at the end of the expansion instead of them slowly withering away. It just feels super bad like that. And isn't it almost a year til the next expansion? This could have waited til shortly before the new expansion is released.</div></div><hr />

If it was actually history. This had 7.1.5 which was just months ago. I'd love posts about what was happening this week 10 years ago...</div></div><hr />

I know you are joking, but just in case someone scrolls past and do miss them they are found here: https://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/<br />
<br />
You have to sort out the non wow ones though.</div></div><hr />

Everything is interesting to someone somewhere,</div></div><hr />

<br />
But some things aren't interesting to most people, and thus not worthy of the space it takes up. I mean if it was ancient WoW history I could understand it, but stuff that happened merely a few years ago?</div></div><hr />

The first content patch of Warlords of Draenor brought small updates to a variety of systems as well as Twitter functionality within World of Warcraft. After the new character models were implemented, there were a few complaints which got fixed during this update. We also saw the addition of the Heirloom tab to make it easier to navigate and create heirlooms on alt characters. The Death Recap panel also got a small upgrade which made it easier to figure out what killed you during combat.<br />
<br />
a few complaints which got fixed lol <br />
If you mean by that they only fixed &quot;a few&quot; of the complaints from the complaints filling hundreds of pages on the forums, you got it. They simply ignored the rest. Good job Blizzard. :D</div></div><hr />
