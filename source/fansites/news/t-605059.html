This change seems to be already active on the last PTR, as reported in the US PTR forum (Molten Armor proccing on ranged attacks just like on melee).<br />
Since I didnt really do much testing on my druid (the lifebloom change would have been easy to spot) I cant be sure about the others, maybe they just forgot to change the patch notes for the last build, that was patched a few days ago.</div></div><hr />

2) Nurturing Instinct increases your healing spells by up to 50/100% of your Agility, and increases healing done to you by 10/20% of your Attack Power while in Cat form.<br />
<br />
This gonna give a big boost to druid in PvP. 20% of 2k AP = +400 healing to whoever heal you.</div></div><hr />

It got like insta replaced to the regrowth bonus due to the massive complaints.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm very annoyed about the lifebloom nerf though.<br />
Resto druids atm in raids are ok'ish certainly not overpowered.<br />
Balance and feral druids in pvp allso do not need this nerf.<br />
<br />
I'll be very glad if they decide to throw arena out the window, really it's messing things up if they will continue to balance around it.</div></div><hr />

It's still opposite of what feral issues are. They lack a group utility. The time spent out of dps is a bigger loss than the healing, not to mention the mana involved with shifting. That +400 healing ON the individual druid is nice. But since there are next to no feral in 3v3 or 5v5, how is this going to make them desirable? If it was added to lotp as a group buff, sure thing. Might turn some heads. As it stands, another solo druid only thing is not all that helpful. <br />
<br />
A snare to make up for the hit box bug would be nice (since they won't fix it). A heal debuff like other melee dps (and hunter) would definitely get some feral group time. A valid spell interrupt wouldn't even hurt.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm thankful they're thinking of feral druids. It's just that they're in opposite land at the moment. If they introduce 1v1 points system, then sure. But as for group PVP, it's a wee bit lacking :-\</div></div><hr />

Word, that was a badly thought through band aid by Blizzard, and I have still heard zero feedback on how the drinking nerf affects decently rated small bracket PvP in the long run.<br />

Did the speed bonus of the legendary bow covern your conclusion?<br />
I don't know if that affetcs the final dps of the bow or not, because I don't know what the max speed bonus of quivers are that you can get atm.</div></div><hr />

Shamans have gotten enough shit, a smart idea would to make Ghost Wolf instant as base for all specs, and make the talent remove snares and immobilizes at a chance of 50/100%.<br />
<br />
<br />
even tho its instant they still have to stop moving so yea that sucks, altho making them like druids would be pretty op, earthbind/frostshock and run away, lol sounds like someone is jealous of another class :D</div></div><hr />

Not counting arrows brings the 50dps back ;]<br />
Legendary bow - no arrows dps.<br />
Epic bows - lower dps, but arrows dps as well.<br />
So it's perfectly balanced and again, leaving your inventory 20 slots bigger. Woot for that imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And now shamans - instant GW... Who said it's instant (this change is not on PTR yet!)? Base cast time 2sec, but what if they changed talent to reduce 0,5/1sec only bringing it back to 1sec cast like now? Would help only those that did not take that talent, and not much anyway as it still doesn't break roots/snares.<br />
And it's not a shapeshifting, it's only a magical (dispellable) buff but the funny thing is you can be scared by hunters in it, polymorphed and slept by druids... so it has all disadvantages of all druid's forms (feral and caster) and no advantage those have (apart 40% more speed than in caster form).<br />
<br />
Elemental shamans got nerf bat badly... /bye for burst dmg with NS/EM shared CD, -1% crit and 25% spell pushback resistance down on PVP set, and to that of course PI change (most probably changed to that and not just this change added to the former effect - as it's indirect elemental shaman nerf too for 5v5 arenas).<br />
<br />
Now, the question is - will they buff other aspects and adress other problems shamans have in PVP or just nerf all specs and leave it as PVE-only class?</div></div><hr />

I just wouldn't say it's super duper amazing, and you could easy get along with any other weapon in the game.<br />
A warlock can still outdps a rogue with twin warglaives.... without legendaries.<br />
<br />
But otherwise agree, Thunderfury is a amazing weapon \o/ , we used to have a holy paladin using it on the adds in Solarian's room ;D<br />
<br />
<br />
he was referring to 1.0, as in molten core and bwl for tanking goblins on those wonderful dragon trash packs or generating high threat and stacking with tclap (for a small time granted) and the toughest raid bosses. <br />
<br />
as you said a lock can outdps a warglaives lock, but tfury gave you the potential for threat gen more than any other weapon pre-tbc.<br />
<br />
solarian should never enter the discussion talking about thunderfury 1.0 :D</div></div><hr />

No, I think it's the highest personal rating of that team, not the highest personal rating of any team they're involved in. So basically if a full s3 dude joins a 1500 team, he'll still have a personal of 1500 so it doesnt really make a difference. Unless im wrong about how this works. If not, it really doesnt change much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To make this a valid PvE talent they should have the + healing done to you work in Bear form as well as Cat. Usually a druid will only have 1500ap or so in bear form (though this changes with gear lvl) so the + healing wouldn't be hugely OP but an extra 300 + healing on an MT would be awesome especially cause our tanking is geared more towards having high HP and Armor versus standard mitigation. <br />
<br />
Just a thought. :)</div></div><hr />

Exactly, I can't see any real benefit to this change. All it means is that if one person has a high rating they just have to leave the team and rejoin then the problem is gone away. Unless they are going to make your personal ratings persist through teams it doesn't really make any difference.<br />

<br />
It's meant to be a buff for feral in arena, but I doubth it have any effect. Personaly I would still not pick that talent. Primal Tenacity is so much better for both PvP and PvE (after the fear mechanics changed.)<br />

The only thing to fix now is to make point gain based on personal score rather than team score. If you combined those two changes then you'd have something. Either that or make personal scores persist through teams.</div></div><hr />

When will devs realise we aren't OP and are the squishiest class even though we wear mail because we have no escape/cc options.<br />
<br />
1. Nerf Elemental crit by 1% for no apparent reason (been like this since beta)<br />
2. Nerf Elemental using NS and EM at same time (been like this since TBC when you could actually get both)<br />
3. Nerf Elemental spell pushback from 70% -&gt; 50% uncalled for, when focused fired or with a rogue on me I still struggle to get a LB off due to pushback and kick and we are too easily CC'd and spell locked out.<br />
<br />
The buffs aren't enough, 30% dispell resistance is not enough because we can't stack as many buffs as druids/priests. They get so many buffs when they get crit, hots, shields, fort/motw it's not funny. A shaman has bloodlust, ES (if resto), SR (if enhance), water breathing. Our buffs will be dispelled too fast still.<br />
<br />
2sec Ghostwolf is a step in the right direction for enhance, but it's dispellable, can be slept/sheeped, and it doesn't break snares/roots. It's like a really lame druid with all the bad aspects, and none of the good except for the speed increase. It does nothing for elemental that need to get out of melee range.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what they would do is drop the team down to like 1100, then invite the sucky player, and they would 2v3 the low ranking team. This will slightly push up the weak players rating. You do this until the team rating was at like 1700. Then you have the sucky player leave and drop the team rating down to 1100 again. You have sucky player join again and work his rating up. After some time he would be at 2k. Then you invite a 3rd good player and those 3 get the team up to 2k. Now sucky player has access to good items.<br />
<br />
what this will do is when they drop it back down to 1100, and sucky person joins, it will match up against 1700 rating teams, so they can't power level a sucky player. <br />
<br />
On a side note, i wish it was personal rating or average rating for all teams. That would help keep those full S3 people out of the 1500 brackets.</div></div><hr />

Druids don't take less damage than all other tanks. Less damage on a hit? Yes. Over the course of a fight? Druids are certainly taking more damage.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't think Bear tanking is &quot;fine.&quot; The basic one is that Warriors and Druids still can't AoE tank in any capacity compared to a Prot Paladin. I'm not claiming Warriors or Druids should be the &quot;best&quot; or even necessarily &quot;equal.&quot; But I find it a stupid, stupid flaw on Blizzard's part to have 10 man content designed for a specific talent spec. In a 25 man, its not unreasonable to assume you could potentially have access to any of the 27 specializations in the class, but in a 10 man dungeon it just gets out of line.<br />
<br />
The second flaw I feel that is Feral Druid specific is purely itemization. By T5 and T6, Bears should have much more HP and Dodge than they currently have available.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully they'll never put in average rating for all teams. I know many of my friends/guildies that play at a certain bracket as their primary &quot;competitive&quot; team and will then play another bracket with the wife/girlfriend/boyfriend/sucks at pvp buddies.</div></div><hr />
