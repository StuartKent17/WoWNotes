<br />
World of Warcraft has had quite an eventful year. We released the newest expansion, Warlords of Draenor, on November 13. The first raid (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/16863396/warlords-of-draenor-journey-into-highmaul-12-2-2014) opened up in early December, and players have had a go at some of Draenor’s most fearsome foes. We marked the 10-year World of Warcraft (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/16889478/world-of-warcraft-10-year-anniversary-celebration-begins-11-20-2014) and 20-year Warcraft anniversaries in-game and with an incredible celebration at BlizzCon last month; debuted a new documentary, World of Warcraft: Looking for Group, on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyPzTywUBsQ&amp;list=PLY0KbDiiFYeNgQkjujixr7qD-FS8qecoP) and Hulu; and released a new pet to support the American Red Cross and their Ebola relief efforts in Africa—and we’re not done yet.<br />
<br />
We’re excited about what’s ahead in 2015, and we wanted to give you a glimpse at some of the long-term projects we’re working on, as well as some features planned for the Patch 6.1 update, which will be hitting the Public Test Realm (PTR) soon.<br />
<br />
Feeling Legendary<br />
We hope everyone is enjoying the Legendary quest line with Khadgar, the next step of which opens up with the Blackrock Foundry raid in the new year. We’re already working on the steps after that, and the quest line will continue in Patch 6.1, where the first-ever Legendary Follower (with suitably Legendary abilities) will be available to join your Garrison. If you’re a fan of collecting Followers but haven’t set out on the Legendary quest line, now is a good time to get started!<br />
<br />
Pepe’s Favorite New Feature<br />
We’re working on the ability to send out Tweets—including screenshots—directly from within WoW, making it easier than ever to let friends know about your Achievements and item drops. We’ll be testing this functionality on the Patch 6.1 PTR.<br />
<br />
Flight Master Competency<br />
We have some new tech in the works that will allow flight masters to provide more-direct routes to your destination, regardless of the flight points your character knows. This’ll mean fewer roundabout routes; the flight masters will instead always try to send you on the shortest existing route. Hopefully, this will get you to your destination faster.<br />
<br />
All About That Base<br />
Garrison improvements, tweaks, and additions are on the horizon. While we’re working on some bigger additions for later on, we have a lot of other changes and additions you’ll see on the next PTR. We’re working on making visiting your friends’ Garrisons even more rewarding, with a daily visitor to set you and your friends on a fun random task (complete with rewards, Achievements, and a meta-Achievement for finishing all of the tasks). We’ll have awesome new items to spend your Garrison Resources on, new Missions to complete with fun new rewards, new items to change your Followers with, a new tier of Garrison-invasion difficulty for the most tenacious of defenders among you (can your Garrison withstand a world boss?), new profession-building Missions, and a whole lot more!<br />
<br />
New Ways to Play<br />
We’re exploring the possibility of giving players a way to buy tradable game-time tokens for the purpose of exchanging them in-game with other players for gold. Our current thought on this is that it would give players a way to use their surplus gold to cover some of their subscription cost, while giving players who might have less play time an option for acquiring gold from other players through a legit and secure system. A few other online games offer a similar option, and players have suggested that they’d be interested in seeing something along those lines in WoW. We agree it could be a good fit for the game, and we look forward to any feedback you have as we continue to look into this feature.<br />
<br />
Collecting Your Heirlooms<br />
We’re pretty far along in development on the much-talked-about Heirloom tab. This will bring the whole Heirloom system into a single account-wide collection UI and provide a clear purchase/upgrade path for all items. Heirlooms already on characters will be collected into the new UI (similar to other Collections features), base-level Heirlooms will be purchasable from vendors, and upgrade tokens that can be used on Heirlooms to raise their effectiveness to additional level caps will be obtainable through different forms of content. We’ll be looking for your feedback on the new system when the 6.1 PTR goes live.<br />
<br />
eSports’in<br />
The new War Games skirmishes feature allows anyone to run an online tournament (http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/about/community-tournaments%C2%AD), and we’re excited to see even more community-run tournaments in 2015. We’ll of course be running tournaments with our eSports partners as well, and will release details as those plans are finalized. As you saw at the Arena World Championship, we’ve come up with an improved UI to help viewers better follow the action, but we’ve been working on a complete overhaul for next year—with the goal of making it widely available for use in player-run tournaments, partner tournaments, and online casting. We hope to be able to share more soon.<br />
<br />
You’re More Beautiful Every Day<br />
As we discussed in the recent preview, new Blood Elf models (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/16940815/artcraft-blood-elf-update-11-25-2014) are on their way, and we’re looking to get them in-game in an upcoming patch. Alongside the new Blood Elf models we’ll also be implementing a couple of tweaks and fixes for other character models, based on player and our own internal feedback, with some additional changes to come in future patches.<br />
<br />
Ashran So Far<br />
We’re continuing to focus on realm pairing and tech changes to help ensure more even fights between the Alliance and the Horde, as well as reduce the queue times to get into the PvP zone for those realms experiencing them. Further into the coming year our focus will be on updating and expanding the content Ashran offers in big new ways, but we’ll have more info on that as we get closer to patches beyond 6.1.<br />
<br />
Game Ogre<br />
Raiders are continuing to enjoy Highmaul in all its ogre-y glory, and we’re watching how things play out as the last couple wings open in Raid Finder difficulty. While progression through Highmaul continues, Warlord Blackhand is eagerly awaiting your arrival in the Blackrock Foundry raid. We’re expecting Blackrock Foundry to become available in February. We’ll announce specific dates once we’ve seen more of how Highmaul progression . . . progresses.<br />
<br />
. . . And Beyond<br />
We have a ton of awesome content planned for next year, as well as some fun surprises, and we can’t wait to share more. See you in-game!<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.1 Heirloom Changes<br />
Below is a rough translation of a post from the EU forums. Please keep in mind it is a translation and isn't perfectly accurate. <br />
I'd like to take this opportunity to provide some information about heirlooms:<br />
<br />
<br />
We plan to them available again with patch 6.1. They are currently being redesigned to fit the new stat system.<br />
The heirlooms will be sold for gold and base level will go up to level 60. Once you buy a heirloom, it will be available for all characters on your account, as toys and pet are now.<br />
The base heirlooms can be upgraded to Tier 2 (usable up to level 90) and Tier 3 (usable up to level 100) in exchange for emblems that will be obtained as a reward for some tasks completed within the game.<br />

<br />
Dungeons, # of quests, exploration. Lots of things they can do. The pvp heirlooms can be # of kills, honor point accumulation, etc. <br />
<br />
Lots of ways they can offer emblems for doing stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll take direct flightpaths over personal flight any day. WoW is FUN again, and the world feels a lot more alive when players are forced to remain grounded. As much as I enjoyed flying over the years, the game lost a lot of it's fun. Roaming around Draenor, discovering new treasures, or new rares has been an absolute blast. I hope they continue on this route in the patches/expansions to come (just wish the Rare Mob loot was Bind-on-Equip, or at least Bind-on-Account).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That concerns me a little because the whole point of heirlooms is to kit your alt out and blitz the content and get it done as quickly as possible. It's going to suck if you're going to ding 60 and not have enough of these things to upgrade the heirloom. And if the answer is you'll always have enough.. why even bother to have an upgrade system in the first place? It just strikes me as a weird change. Upgrading level 90 ones I can understand... but lower levels?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if he is, any friend who comes to visit your garrison must be showed around first by Khadgar's Servant before they can access the phase their friend is in. This tour includes the lands around the garrison, including the mines, garden, Druid of the Claw place, front door, each individual building (as well as explain their purpose and status), town hall, and the outside of the garrison wall. At the end of the quest, you must then decide if you still want to have friends, or if you will abandon them for the sake of escaping Khadgar's Servant.<br />

Esports: Naa.. if I want ESports I'll go and play Dota. WoW istn't the right game for that.<br />
Money &lt;~&gt; Gold: Well I have a job and therefore do not care about 12-13 Euro a month.. And I have enough gold because I loved AH trading before WoD. So it's basically a nice to have.. Clearly build to push ingame/shop transactions<br />
Heirloom tab is ok, but all my classes are already at least 90. how about a freaking account reagent bank instead? now that would be helpful!<br />
Legendary Follower.. Yeah.. Now wait, in Feb all my followers will be Epic and I will have any issues with any missions anyways. So.. Nit that interesting.<br />
<br />
New Raid? So that's the only interesting thing here. Unfortunately I do not raid atm due to a lack of free time (which was no problem in SoO due to Wings). So... Well maybe I should just quit.,:)</div></div><hr />

Doesn't have to be done on the alt. I imagine it would be like now where you do that on your main to earn the upgrade and then the alts benefit from that.</div></div><hr />

3 of the things listed in your list is related to garrisons. so lets just say &quot;new garrison gameplay features&quot; because thats what 3 of the things you listed pertain to.<br />
<br />
the other 2 are related to content that was either supposed to be in at launch, or is being reworked because theres issues with it.<br />

again, im not looking to argue, and im not trolling, its easy to see how some people might feel a little let down because from my own personal view/opinion, it does look like theyre using a lot of words to hype up the patch.</div></div><hr />

We hope everyone is enjoying the Legendary quest line with Khadgar, the next step of which opens up with the Blackrock Foundry raid in the new year. We’re already working on the steps after that, and the quest line will continue in Patch 6.1, where the first-ever Legendary Follower (with suitably Legendary abilities) will be available to join your Garrison. If you’re a fan of collecting Followers but haven’t set out on the Legendary quest line, now is a good time to get started!<br />

Asia has different rules than we do here, which is how they were able to do it. Plus Asian gold farmer could viable here. <br />
<br />
So it isn't a viable way of p2w, when their market is different from ours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No chance they'll do that as long as morons riding the Hyperbole Train are around saying how FUN the game is NOW when it wasn't BEFORE despite flying being there for 8 fucking years and even through the expansion most people hail as the greatest of them all.<br />
<br />
Pah, people are suckers when they can't even decide for themselves what is fun and require being FORCED into a certain kind of gameplay.<br />
<br />
Just because people hail one expansion doesn't mean they hail everything in it. Flying mounts is still one of the worst design choices they ever conducted.</div></div><hr />

What a joke these developers think they're stars and people spit out the shit they're swallowing to agree.<br />

I have to disagree with you on that, I'm using twitter regularly for updates, news, patch notes, servers issues and customer support etc.<br />
Never have I felt that Blizzard or any other person/company I'm following is condescending or spoken with contempt.<br />
<br />
So i'm guessing that you're just butthurt because Blizzard didn't cater to your specific desires? The game didn't go the way you wanted?<br />
There's always someone hating for no apparent reason. (based on your posting history, you're bashing blizzard in 50% of your posts -_-)<br />
<br />
As for Twitter, someone you don't like? don't follow them, simple as that.<br />
And IIRC they're implementing The ability to send tweets from in game. not read existing tweets, you won't be reading tweets from Devs (yet at least).<br />
<br />
Edit: Twitter is huge in America, by far more used than in Europe, Europeans mostly use facebook (which is by far worse than Twitter when it comes to site content just fyi).</div></div><hr />

One of our raiders in MoP had a great job, no kids, and no real responsibilities other than work. However he worked like 65 hours a week and would routinely buy game cards and sell them to friends for gold. Now he only did this for friends, and the people he did it for were more than happy to farm gold for a week and buy game time for the next two months from him. This will no allow folks to buy from folks they dont know without the fear of getting scammed with fake game time codes.

You can only take what, 20k with you? So they must've bought hundreds of thousands of gold on each server.<br />

Sorry, You might want to buck up and get that butt really tight, because I doubt flying is not coming back to the game and if the routing system works well they very well might put it in the older content as well. I am so used to not flying now, I have not used one in the older content since the expansion dropped and I was wanting flying to come back, but I have adapted to the new way of play the game, which is the very old way of playing the game that I enjoy back then as well. <br />
<br />
Though they do have a lot of my money and gold, which I would take some about 20k gold for and say have nice day to never see flying again. I know I have paid more that in both time and money for the various levels of flying across some 20 characters and let not forget those store mounts the simply look stupid on the ground.</div></div><hr />

There are few mmo having the &quot;plex-like system&quot; (like Rift) and there are still goldsellers on those games. Instead of selling gold, they're selling the game's &quot;plex&quot; much cheaper than the official ones.<br />

We’re exploring the possibility of giving players a way to buy tradable game-time tokens for the purpose of exchanging them in-game with other players for gold. Our current thought on this is that it would give players a way to use their surplus gold to cover some of their subscription cost, while giving players who might have less play time an option for acquiring gold from other players through a legit and secure system. A few other online games offer a similar option, and players have suggested that they’d be interested in seeing something along those lines in WoW. We agree it could be a good fit for the game, and we look forward to any feedback you have as we continue to look into this feature.<br />
Now I'm interested, i have time to play but i can't play, i hope this will be implemented soon :D<br />

We have some new tech in the works that will allow flight masters to provide more-direct routes to your destination, regardless of the flight points your character knows. This’ll mean fewer roundabout routes; the flight masters will instead always try to send you on the shortest existing route. Hopefully, this will get you to your destination faster.<br />

Its 6.1, its a minor content patch. Putting it in perspective, 6.1 for MoP was the Domination Point stuff in Krasarang wilds, so expect something to that degree. I'd imagine Tanaan Jungle would be a major content patch with a raid tier, like Isle of Thunder was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Yay, now I don't need to pay for WoW anymore.<br />
<br />
I really do hope those heirlooms can boost upto 50% xp from 1-100<br />
<br />
Would really love to level all my toons to 100 but the leveling progress is just sooooo boring. It's more boring to level then to stare at a wall. Got all classes at 85+(2 still at 85 that I cba lvling, cause meh) and the remaining ones are 90 except 1 93 and 1 96. It's not that the zones are boring or anything like that, it's just that having to level every single expansion, including in classic just gets so boring after a while, nothing really impresses me or motivates me to level. I would gladly pay money(if I had any) to boost all my chars to 100, cause I'd rather work then level, but max content is just so much fun I kinda have to level more toons to 100.<br />
<br />
And yeah no more paying irl money for game time wohoo, inb4 1 month = 100k gold. But if it's gonna be around 20k~ ish it will be a great deal. :D<br />
<br />
Though I have no idea how this trading process will work, is it an item you just trade through the trade windows and when consumed it loads game time to your account lol? Anyways hope it wont be too expensive and a safe trade.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Feeling Legendary&quot; hardly, so far the questline is ok...yet nothing special, it might turn out to be an easymode legendary for everyone, thats hardly &quot;legendary&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pepe’s Favorite New Feature&quot; ./facepalm i can´t be the only one that wishes for them to focus on more important thing than this stupidity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flight Master Competency&quot; yeah still no flying, sitting on a taxi from point A to B is still the norm, even if its faster. Why again have we flying mounts in the game?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;All About That Base&quot; we will see...i don´t believe anything anymore when it comes to this half ass executed feature.<br />
<br />
&quot;New Ways to Play&quot; Ah yes here we go, something i predicted years ago, the slow path to the option of F2P. Don´t get me wrong this is not such a bad thing. But it only works with a healthy player driven economic system (see EVE). Now that works. We don´t have that in WoW, infact with this addon they totaly destroyed professions, the only thing worth something is enchanting. With no healthy economy ingame, this is a stupid thing to do and just shows that the people now working on the game have no fucking idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Collecting Your Heirlooms&quot; whatever, lvling is faceroll anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;eSports’in&quot; laughable, even more so if you take the current situation of class balance in perspective. WoW will never be an esports game. They tried this years ago, and no esport organization, except a console one(!) took them, and that got cancelled. The only game they ever made, that got into esport outside of the Blizzard fanbase was and will be SC. No hearthstone should not be considered (especialy with the the first real &quot;everything random&quot; expansion&quot; an esport game. It isnt one.<br />
<br />
&quot;You’re More Beautiful Every Day&quot; i hope they will take in account the critics about male NE animations etc. The textures are great, the animations are borderline bad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashran So Far&quot; lots of blabla it will stay a zerg fest, it was designed as one, thats fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Game Ogre&quot; Thats fine, but if Blackrock Foundry comes out in two months...how long will it take for a new content then? That is the burning question. <br />
<br />
&quot;. . . And Beyond<br />
We have a ton of awesome content planned for next year, as well as some fun surprises, and we can’t wait to share more. See you in-game!&quot;<br />
<br />
yeah i know how that usualy turns out...lots of time of waiting...more and more from every addon to addon....*snore*</div></div><hr />

Me and my friends are loving Draenor so far -between Heroic progression, Garrisons, Followers and the usual grinds it's hard to find the time to do it all, but it just feels right. Everybody I know has something to do and is pretty much having a lot of fun doing it!<br />

We have some new tech in the works that will allow flight masters to provide more-direct routes to your destination, regardless of the flight points your character knows. This’ll mean fewer roundabout routes; the flight masters will instead always try to send you on the shortest existing route. Hopefully, this will get you to your destination faster.<br />
<br />
<br />
Will it affect old world? You know old world flightmasters were horrible :D<br />

&quot;Feeling Legendary&quot; hardly, so far the questline is ok...yet nothing special, it might turn out to be an easymode legendary for everyone, thats hardly &quot;legendary&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Pepe’s Favorite New Feature&quot; ./facepalm i can´t be the only one that wishes for them to focus on more important thing than this stupidity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Flight Master Competency&quot; yeah still no flying, sitting on a taxi from point A to B is still the norm, even if its faster. Why again have we flying mounts in the game?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;All About That Base&quot; we will see...i don´t believe anything anymore when it comes to this half ass executed feature.<br />
<br />
&quot;New Ways to Play&quot; Ah yes here we go, something i predicted years ago, the slow path to the option of F2P. Don´t get me wrong this is not such a bad thing. But it only works with a healthy player driven economic system (see EVE). Now that works. We don´t have that in WoW, infact with this addon they totaly destroyed professions, the only thing worth something is enchanting. With no healthy economy ingame, this is a stupid thing to do and just shows that the people now working on the game have no fucking idea.<br />
<br />
&quot;Collecting Your Heirlooms&quot; whatever, lvling is faceroll anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;eSports’in&quot; laughable, even more so if you take the current situation of class balance in perspective. WoW will never be an esports game. They tried this years ago, and no esport organization, except a console one(!) took them, and that got cancelled. The only game they ever made, that got into esport outside of the Blizzard fanbase was and will be SC. No hearthstone should not be considered (especialy with the the first real &quot;everything random&quot; expansion&quot; an esport game. It isnt one.<br />
<br />
&quot;You’re More Beautiful Every Day&quot; i hope they will take in account the critics about male NE animations etc. The textures are great, the animations are borderline bad.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ashran So Far&quot; lots of blabla it will stay a zerg fest, it was designed as one, thats fine.<br />
<br />
&quot;Game Ogre&quot; Thats fine, but if Blackrock Foundry comes out in two months...how long will it take for a new content then? That is the burning question. <br />
<br />
&quot;. . . And Beyond<br />
We have a ton of awesome content planned for next year, as well as some fun surprises, and we can’t wait to share more. See you in-game!&quot;<br />

<br />
Most of the changes are okay, would like more information about the dick rip involved with getting heirloom currency and why they want them usable to 100. Also, how the compensation for people that already have heirlooms coming into this system.<br />
<br />
Game time tokens were a long thing coming and will just deflate gold, allowing more gold for those with expendable real life income and more game availability to those with limited income. Legendary follower seems like a shoehorn, hopefully they raise follower cap or alternatively make the legendary follower have his own slot.<br />
<br />
The tweeting from in game is as annoying as ever, even more of a reason to avoid social media outlets when you can start throwing shit at them in mainstream games now.

According to COMMON SENSE those of us who have upgraded our old 1-80 heirlooms to 80-85 will get the tier 2 heirlooms (a.k.a. the ones that scale up to 90) and all the rest who still possess the 1-80 will get the tier 1 heirlooms (a.k.a. the 1-60 ones). Which is a bit disappointing since you get penalized for having the 1-80 and end up losing 20 levels, but yeah mysterious are the ways of Blizzard's logic. <br />
<br />
What worries me the most is what happens with the enchants already on them (if any). Will they stick or will we have to re-enchant the heirloom in question every time? And if this whole thing is to work like the toy box tab will I be able to kit two of my toons with the same item at the same time? Or will it gray out once &quot;removed&quot; from the tab to be equipped by a toon becoming unavailable? We need more valid info on how the compensation for people already in possession of various levels of heirlooms (and enchants on them) will work out, other than some simple two liner announcement.</div></div><hr />

I can understand this logic, but at the same time I really can't think of any of the best items being sold for gold? PVP gear needs points, and PVE gear needs apexis crystals. It certainly would mean you could buy your way into vanity items if you so desired but I don't really see how that's winning.<br />

<br />
Ultimately this is what will happen since the economic system in WoW is broken - if we got rid of all the concept of soulbound (expect for items that have been equipped) then something could be done. But right now the crafting system is totally broken and tens of new gold sinks have been created with many more to come. So what is going to happen is that gold will become scarce, this is where pay to win will kick in, maybe not by Blizzard's design, but it will certainly happen like that.<br />

FFS. <br />
<br />
They aren't selling GOLD, they are selling *tradeable* little chunks of game time for cash. <br />
<br />
The players are going to sell that for gold but since they specifically say it is tradeable then there's no reason that gold has to be the currency. It could be any kind of tradeable item, maybe 200 stacks of ore, or 3 level 25 battle pets, or whatever. People should get creative with it.</div></div><hr />

I think in another couple months the fanfare will largely be over the treasure and elites will have long since seen the light of day and the only daily in the game is starting to largely repeat itself. I have been seeing a lot more people camping out in Warspear, its the new Org or Shrine now. The illusion of will be largely over once the patch with no new world content and only garrison and raiding content coming. Well the masses that are out now grind everything and consuming as fast as possible will way themselves eventually to the cities complaining about nothing new to do. By the time 6.1 drops those that will have leveled and ground rep will be gone and the landscape as bare as it always is about 3-5 months out. The only ones that will be around are the altoholics that level endless amounts of characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup. And Blizzard wins because at a minimum the people with plenty of time to play but no money to pay for it can have their subs covered by people who just want to buy gold. <br />
<br />
WoW gets more and more like Diablo 3 all the time. Wonder why?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe I'm reading this wrong, but it seems like the new Blood Elf models could come before 6.1 (everything else was expressly stated to be coming in 6.1). <br />
<br />
Here's hoping this turns out to be the case. It's disappointing that it wasn't in the game already, but I'll be content if they get here asap. Waiting until 6.1 for something that should have been implemented at launch is irritating. Better late than never, though.</div></div><hr />

They aren't selling GOLD, they are selling *tradeable* little chunks of game time for cash. <br />
<br />
The players are going to sell that for gold but since they specifically say it is tradeable then there's no reason that gold has to be the currency. It could be any kind of tradeable item, maybe 200 stacks of ore, or 3 level 25 battle pets, or whatever. People should get creative with it.<br />
<br />
Are you daft?<br />
<br />
Blizzard sells a product (game time) that has an ingame value, whether it be gold, ore or fucking Abyssal Gulper Eels. They are basically saying 'we give up on trying to figure out clever ways to prevent rich kids from buying with money what others have to farm for, so instead lets put ourselves in a position where we can profit from it. Fuck the normal people who do need to actually play the game to get their ingame currencies.'<br />
<br />
The &quot;if you can't beat em, join em&quot; approach to gold sellers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard is so far gone.. so out of touch with their player base. Do they have some kind of deal going with Twitter? It's just getting a bit ridiculous. So many people have already complained about hating important information showing up on it instead of the official website or forums.<br />
<br />
What could possibly be so important that you couldn't alt tab or pick up your phone to tweet something? I don't know a single person IRL that even uses the stupid thing.<br />

<br />
* Account wide reputation. This ability does not need to be specific to a character when considering either legacy reputation or current ones after a certain period of time has been accomplished. With the fact that toys, mounts, pets and other items now account wide, why not move to the next chapter of changing this so people doesn't have to grind old reputation just so they can get an item for transmog or other purposes. <br />
* Ability to send gold or BOE via mail to other realms: Would love to see this one day, makes this at least account wide only and not to other characters to be more secured. <br />
* World Bosses Re spawn time change: As of the Moment People still farm world bosses from pandaria but finding a world boss dead and then know that you have to wait 1-2 hours for re spawn tends to break groups. Is the a possibility to have this change for such bosses like Oondasta and Galleon at least to the same re spawn timer like sha of anger or nalak? this would be good for those farmers out there. <br />
* Summon Stone World Boss: Would like to have a summon stone at the world boss location to help out with the process in getting people there faster. We have this for raids and dungeons, why not world bosses?<br />
* Account Wide Tabards: Enough said :)<br />
* New Heirloom items: When can we expect belt, hands, boots, neck, etc... heirloom items? With the boost availability to 90, can we expect these to show up in the future for those people that dont wish to pay but rather play using heirlooms? <br />
* New Boost option in store: Have a boost option for those people that wish to boost from 90-100 with the purchase of USD on the store. Hopefully we see this on 6.2 or 6.3 patches....<br />
* Store Transmog Armor Set: Full armor set as beautiful as those old challenge mode sets. Dont just sell 1 part to be use with other but a new full armor set would be cool. <br />
* Scale down lvl and ilvl in old dungeons: This would be nice to bring to the game for those people out there that wish we can play firelands not as lvl 90 or 100 but as it was in current lvl 85 with 378 or 391 gear scale down. This could bring other challenges to the game. <br />
* Garrison mission for transmog gear: Send garrison follower to old content to farm epic gear for transmog purposes. <br />
* SLI Capabilities in future patches and Expansions<br />
<br />
On the side note, blizzard keep doing a good job. Love seeing all these changes that were brought to WOD. Have a Merry Christmas All.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elaszunne</div><div class="date">2014-12-24, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">6.1 Patch features I would like to see are as follows:<br />
<br />
*Features that will make it less painful to level alts, like the lowering the price for Garrison plans or eliminate the price all together for alt characters as well as the gated wait time to get them.<br />
*Secondary Professions that are account wide.<br />
*Account wide reputation.<br />
*Allow group members to share the daily garrison quest with other members of their group ( had several folks forget to take the garrison daily and have to go back) or allow a quest giver at the daily location.<br />
*Account bound weapons like in Mists once you made it and leveled a character to 90 you could pass it to another character to help with leveling. or make Heirlooms scale to 100 for alts.</div></div><hr />

Y'know, I really wish they would give some kind of enhanced archeology features. That profession really got the shaft this expansion. Sure, there are a couple BoA items and pets, but there is a real loss for flavor items of toys. Also, they crates just make you go back to pandaland?! I mean... It's like blizzard half assed trying to include the Arrakoa to the archeology line, but just left it at &quot;do some jumping puzzles for added fragments!&quot;.</div></div><hr />
