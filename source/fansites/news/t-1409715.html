Warlock Solo - Immerseus 10 Normal<br />
Today we are taking a look at clever use of boss mechanics that allow warlocks to solo Immerseus. <br />

<br />
Addon - BossesKilled<br />
The BossesKilled addon (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/bosseskilled) is a nice addition to the Raid Finder and Flex Raid UI that quickly shows you how many bosses you have killed in each wing, without having to select each one to check. Clicking a button will select that wing and the buttons will highlight if you are queued for that wing. <br />

<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Character / Items<br />
Is your intent for hybrids to have to carry spare gear or can we get a glyph or something that makes armor/spirit boost dps?<br />
Less extra gear than you do today for sure. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403637080586072065))<br />
<br />
In Warlords of Draenor, are crafted items likely to be able to acquire the bonus stats/socket?<br />
Considering that just so they can compete. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402646022158966784))<br />
<br />
A little confused what tanks will gear for on normal items? Mastery/Haste?<br />
Yes, and even crit and other stats. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403318682710851584))<br />
<br />
I'm assuming gems and enchants will still have spirit options, even though we're paring down. Correct?<br />
Gems, yes. Still debating exact enchanting mechanics. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403318504926896128))<br />
<br />
you can literally double your dps from one pull to another with different trinket rng right now. Not fun.<br />
That's all a problem with the pull though. Otherwise RNG variance evens out over the course of a fight. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402536847848378369))<br />
We want to make the &quot;line up all CDs do do 50% of your DPS in the first 10 sec&quot; thing go away. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402536961077829632))<br />
I feel like Stormlash, Skull Banner and Prepot are huge contributors. Would be ok with all of them disappearing.<br />
Except for prepot, none of the CDs offend us alone. It's the synergistic effect that is out of control. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402559542468169729))<br />
Yet rules about X not working while Y is active can also be annoying, so it's not a simple fix. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402559626249388032))<br />
Sure it is! Just don't add so many cooldowns to the game! If you see two spells too similar on 1 class, axe one<br />
That pitch would mean no Recklessness for Fury or GoaK for Ret. Think there would be no outrage? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402655486618529792))<br />
<br />
Shouldn't DPS roles in raid be rewarded for following trinket procs? I default UI still and have no problems being in top 98%+<br />
Yeah, totally. That's the point of having them proc. The pendulum just swung too far the other way. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403951403879505920))<br />
<br />
and all trinkets/CDs on the pull is fun/interesting, not having anything proc in the opener is boring and lowers skillcap.<br />
Again, disagree that it's skillful. It might be fun to see big numbers but it's frustrating when you don't get the big numbers. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402546113229516800))<br />
We then get pressure to basically insure that you get the big numbers, at which point pulling them off isn't exciting any longer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402546250722979841))<br />
Fixing things like snapshotting and less &quot;on the pull&quot; emphasis can keep it exciting without failure being debilitating. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402546342225903616))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Possible to give pets 15% exp/remove &quot;always behind&quot; in pet AI? Causes many issues that this easily solves<br />
We don't really want pets standing on top of tanks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402654294471487489))<br />
<br />
Not sure right person to ask, but will there be any change about asia's different lockout and ilvl things in WoD?<br />
Our hope is Asia can use the same model now. It will support multiple raid lockouts, which the current system does. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402646530022051840))<br />
<br />
So is 1 in 50 players having their guilds merge/disband acceptable casualties? A &quot;courageous&quot; idea<br />
That argument is an easy one to swing around. There are players who liked downranking or spell components. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402538839425560576))<br />
But sometimes the game needs to change for the good of the game as as whole, even if individual players don't agree. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402538962566123520))<br />
<br />
I'm confused on how loot lockouts will work. do normal, heroic and mythic all share a loot lockout?<br />
No. A loot lockout only applies to one difficulty level. Mythic works mostly like heroic today. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402537580471664641))<br />
<br />
Cant you keep difficulties same as now, adding Mythic on top of it? People wont careas much at that level is all about progres<br />
It is possible to have too many difficulty levels. Aren't you asking for a 7th? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402537240493961217))<br />
<br />
But do you PREFER to let them decide that? It's often 1 person thinking for the group, w/o consulting them.<br />
That seems like a social issue if you mistrust your guild or pug. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402536357207080961))<br />
Even pugs need to have some teeth, or they are just back to LFR's level of no responsibility for anyone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402536477034172416))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
You overuse &quot;depth&quot; like players overuse &quot;clunky.&quot;<br />
I'm a former scientist, so I try to use words precisely. &quot;Depth&quot; to me means that there is more going on than first appears. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403640446959628288))<br />
That's a useful feature of game design because it plays into easy to learn / difficult to master. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403640605869228032))<br />
The problem with &quot;clunky&quot; is many players just use it to mean &quot;I don't like this,&quot; which lacks precision. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403640714765942784))<br />
Our original, internal use of clunky, which likely spilled out onto the forums, had a precise meaning. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403640809385242624))<br />
We originally used &quot;clunky&quot; to mean something that was unintuitive and required extraneous steps to achieve. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403641520223309824))<br />
An example could be old Berserker Rage for a tank -- stance dance out of Defensive, break the fear, stance dance back. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403641675173470208))<br />
<br />
Yes, I agree, swing the nerfbat much much harder at removing cooldowns with dumb visuals :P<br />
Thinking something like GoAK for Prot, wings for Ret, Divine Favor with a better visual for Holy. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403605169834700800))<br />
I like it. Guardians should &quot;guard&quot; after all. Does that change Divine Favor mechanically for Holy at all?<br />
I don't know. It was raw idea more than a design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403637338753880064))<br />

I distinctly remember a mage soloing a good chunk of a Naxx wing and a rogue soloing patchwerk in WOTLK. I also recall a warlock soloing Hydross in Serpentshrine Cavern in BC and various other hilarious things like rogues reaching 100% evasion and tanking bosses like Illidan so they had to put a -% dodge debuff in Sunwell because of them. Gimmicky stuff has been around since the beginning, fellas. This warlocks pet is immune to the debuffing breath as far as I can see, which trivializes the encounter, that is all.</div></div><hr />

It's actually quite helpful if you've got a handful of alts (7 90's including my main) that you're running through LFRs every week. Granted, I only run maybe 3 toons throughout the week, but I certainly can't keep track of each boss I down on which alt. This is super helpful for someone such as myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 hour, 14 mins. You can see it at the end of the video<br />
<br />
http://i.imgur.com/Fk49x94.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
This warlocks pet is immune to the debuffing breath as far as I can see, which trivializes the encounter, that is all.<br />
<br />
Not immune, but all pets (hunter pets too, IIRC) have a 90% damage reduction to AoE abilities. Corrosive Blast is a frontal cone AoE, so the damage reduction applies to it, effectively trivialising the ability. It works because if there's nobody in melee range of the boss, he just casts Corrosive Blast on the nearest player (or pet). The warlock in this video positions his pet so that it's out of melee range, but closer than the warlock himself, and off to the side so that he doesn't get hit by the frontal cone too. Then it's just a matter of out-ranging the Swirl if it's going to cross your path, and not standing in the shit on the ground. When the boss enrages, the enrage actually only lasts for 30 minutes, so you just need to continue the boss fight without getting hit for 30 mins until he un-enrages, and the fight continues like normal until he's killed.<br />
<br />
Sidenote: The same warlock attempted the boss on Heroic too on the next reset, and lasted over an hour, but only got the boss to 86 energy in that time, so gave up because he didn't want to sit there for upwards of 6 hours to kill it. <br />
<br />
Also: Ji-Kun works in a similar way to Immerseus, in that if there's nobody in melee range, it continually casts Quills. There've been a few warlocks who've solo'd Ji-Kun already, just by keeping up enough self-healing to negate Quills damage. (Supposedly ~23k HPS).</div></div><hr />

I managed to get it down to around 40% in total before I lost concentration and fucked up on my Frost Mage (with only 548 ilvl)<br />
<br />
However, yes. I does take a very Very long time (took my about 90mins to get it down to 40mins)<br />
<br />
ps. The people that say pets take 90% less damage from aoe are correct. However, they take 90% less damage from Unavoidable aoe. They take 100% less damage from Avoidable aoe. As all the damage apart from the explosions when the boss remerges is avoidable then the pets take no damage at all apart from that 1 point where you can very easily heal them back up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a mage you can simply rocket boost + invis past it. Hunter I'd say you could either use 2 invis pots and wait in the middle. With lock you can soulstone yourself. Jump down into the pool and get as close to the pack on the left as possible, put a gateway up to the middle between the trash pack and the 2 big guys. Jump, ress yourself when you pull, then do the same again to get past the big guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you get inside jump straight down to where those blobbs spawns instead of walking on the sides then use one invis pot to get past the first pack, go and stand between the first and the second pack then soulstone yourself and send a pet to pull the second pack use burning rush and run towards immersus, use dark bargain if you need it to get far enough so that you can ress without pulling anything. Now just keep soulstone up during boss tries so you don't have to do it again.</div></div><hr />

You guys are acting like everyone is doing it. It's only few skilled and dedicated players doing it, not everyone in timeless gear. Besides it's Immerseus - first boss of the tier. It's not like he's supposed to be hard.</div></div><hr />

They need to be nerfed for other reasons. Namely, their extremely high damage, extremely high survivability, extremely good raid utility. . . Really, the only reason you can't use 5 Warlocks in a 10-man raid is because they'd be geared far too slowly. Thankfully, they are being nerfed~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes all classes with pets can do it (Frost mage, Lock, Hunter and DK, but it wil take ages as dk since all you can do is ranged attacks), just make sure your pet makes the first hit and then move it so it wont stand in melee range. But I wouldnt call this clever use of game mechanics, its more of an exploit since you simply removes the possibility of the boss to do melee attacks and you remove the enrage timer.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I would assume it'd be possible for any class to solo a boss that roots its self in place (durumu, ji'kun, immerseus etc) as long as they have some way of dealing with the mechanics they do when you're out of reach. Ji'kun spams quills if there's no one in melee, Durumu spams &quot;gaze&quot; (50% weapon dmg ranged attack on entire raid), Sha of fear and pride spam reaching attack... Immerseus just continues to do the same thing he always does, and that makes it a much more trivial boss to solo. There's in theory very little healing you actually have to do to be able to kill him as you can avoid swirl, and move out of the sha puddles.<br />
<br />
So yeah, you could do it as a hunter. Just put it on passive, and put it outside melee range, but closer to the boss than you and it'll soak the breaths. You'll just do a little less damage is all.<br />
<br />
Immerseus is weird for a rooted boss, every other boss this expac that roots themselves in place has something they do if no one is in melee... Elegon, vizier, sha of fear, ji'kun, durumu, megera, phase 2 ra-den, Sha of Pride. Every one of those will make you heal through something if you're not in range (or in elegon's case he'll yank you to him). Immerseus is just like &quot;hurrrrrr i'll breath you every 30 seconds and put puddles on the ground&quot;.</div></div><hr />

For some reason the pets are completely immune to it though (rather than 90% reduction), and for some reason he doesn't target the highest aggro unit but the closest instead (but he does target the highest aggro target if the pet is in melee, which makes it even weirder)<br />

<br />
It has never been impossible. There is always someone soloing current content raids. Either by cleaver mechanic usage or flaws in the mechanics(such as pets being immune to the debuffs and such). Mages were able to solo all of Naxx during the start of LK by spell stealing the bone shield buff from the DKs there and just dragging one around with them to keep the buff refreshed. Blizz ended up making that spell immune to spell steal to fix it because it was such a damn powerful spell to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Get the glyph that lets you chain MD to your pet, put your pet on passive &amp; standing ~30 yards to your right, kgo. You'll need to remember to keep the MD refreshed constantly, but it should work fine.<br />

You'd also need to be a bit more careful on the damage, but deterrence will deal with the slime explosions from p2 even better than a lock &amp; your healing talent tier should be enough to clean up any incidental damage.<br />

Feral druids could reach 100% evasion by the end of T6. Twas a fun time :)<br />
<br />
I also remember a rogue hitting 100% evasion and doing Gruul solo back in TBC. People will always find shit to complain about.</div></div><hr />

If you have a class like a warlock soloing current content, then IMO, blizz is doing it wrong. Back in Wrath and the previous expansions, this was IMPOSSIBLE to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
come on really? i remember warlocks soloing hydross in burning crusade so don't tell me its &quot;impossible&quot;. its happened every expansion before and will continue after. The sentiment &quot;theres always someone better&quot; comes to mind</div></div><hr />

When he enrages he one shots the raid now. I know this because we were doing the achievement for it a few weeks ago, and he berserked cause we took our jolly time with stopping oozes from reaching the middle.<br />
Video was posted on Nov. 20th. Also, we're talking about a pet class.<br />
