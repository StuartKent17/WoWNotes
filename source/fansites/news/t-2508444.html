We expect these free character moves to remain open until 11:00 a.m. PDT (2:00 a.m. EDT) on Monday, September 16. Please note that restrictions apply:<br />
<br />
<br />
A character cannot move if the character:<br />
<br />
is a guild leader.<br />
has active auction listings or bids.<br />
has mail.<br />
<br />
You may be required to change your character’s name once you’ve reached the destination realm.<br />
You cannot move a character to a PvP realm where you already have a character belonging to the opposing faction.<br />
This is a one-way, irreversible move. Blizzard Customer Support cannot monitor or modify a free character move.<br />
<br />
<br />
During periods of high usage, free character moves may take up to several hours to complete. This service may be closed at any time, without warning, should a destination realm become full. We strongly encourage players who wish to use this service, especially in coordinated groups, to do so as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

Every day I stray further down the path of never ending wipers I pray for the day when I can solidify my poo without the need to wipe away all the goo.</div></div><hr />

The faction balance is slightly horde favored, but only about 60/40. Much better than some of the ridiculously lopsided pvp servers out there. Join us!</div></div><hr />

Westfall hasn't had a queue since day 1</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
I tried Pagle on release, 6pm EST Aug 26th, never got to play. Tried Westfall Aug 27th, Aug 28th, and Aug 29th (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday). Was able to play each day, but suffered a queue each time, without fail. Made the decision to play Ashkandi Aug 30th Friday afternoon for a queue-free weekend, deleting my reserve characters on Pagle and my level 5 on Westfall early Sunday morning.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you enjoyed no queue during the time you play, but during prime time hours after my day shift, Westfall had a queue the entire launch week. I've even seen Westfall say &quot;Full&quot; on the realm list over this past weekend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My server is typically medium population (sometimes high), and even I have experienced queues a couple of times.</div></div><hr />

why you don't post the EU ones?<br />
its not the first time and I got news for you... you have EU viewers as well, unless you don't want them or you don't care.<br />
Trying to be polite as much as I can, but like I said, its not the 1st time.<br />
EU servers have also queues and these migrations post need spotlight as well.<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is my life bro. I used to be a red is dead kind of guy, but if you live by that philosophy it's actually impossible to level because there are people everywhere. <br />
<br />
I had to take a break from murdering alliance just so I could get some levels.</div></div><hr />

Not many Americans care about the outside world. Many barely knows it exists. Something about America being the greatest* country in the world. I blame education.<br />
