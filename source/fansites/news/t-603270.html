Hunter Bugfixes<br />
The hunters nerfs are definitely here on purpose and have been added to the patch notes. You should still be able to drink during trash mobs fights. <br />
Fixed a bug in which Hunters were able to use Readiness in conjunction with Freezing Trap on two different targets.<br />
Fixed a bug in which Hunters were able to disengage from combat using Feign Death during boss encounters. <br />

Skald fire elementals bug<br />
According to this blue post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2968178446&amp;postId=29491835017&amp;sid=1#2), it seems that the fire elementals in Skald (north of Blade's Edge Mountains) are bugged and instantly respawn. I checked it this morning and it's still working so I guess it could be a good time to farm primal fires. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
3 or 4 days of blue posts so I had to filter out a few of them but the most important posts/issues should be reported. You can almost consider this as a 2.3.1 / 2.3.2 patch preview, tons of bug fixes to make you happy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">salty</div><div class="date">2007-11-16, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There were 3 spots I've noticed where the pet pathing bug was evident and applied to more than one Hunter. In every instance, when I use Kill Command, my pet will path to the mob and attack it successfully, but then bug out and run backwards through the instance.<br />
<br />
1) Karazhan - Our group was fighting on the incline between the platforms immediately adjecent to Shade of Aran and Illihoof. We pulled the four ghosts onto the incline and fought them there. While on this platform, when I sent my pet to attack a mob standing on the incline, my pet was sent dashing for the instance entrance down through the library the way we came.<br />
<br />
2) Serpentshrine Cavern - The first pull in the instance. While standing on the platform at the top of the 2nd Elevator and fighting the mobs as they were tanked on the platform at the bottom of the decline (near where the pack hangs out), my pet and another hunter's pet pathed forwards through the instance along the bridge (towards Hydross), pulling all packs along the way. I was standing either on the decline or on the platform adjacent to the elevator.<br />
<br />
3) Serpentshrine Cavern - Hydross encounter. During the 1st phase, Hydross is standing on his platform, doing his frost aura debuff, all hunter pets are able to attack him normally. But when the first transition takes place, our raid moves Hydross off of his platform and tanks him on the slightly lower level. While on this level, Hunter pets are unable to attack him, and instead path towards the front of the instance along the bridge.<br />

When I get home I'll post the screenshot I took during scenario #3 somewhere.</div></div><hr />

Wow, this will piss of a LOT of hunters. Maybe they will know how it is when Rogues vanish in a boss encounter only to still be in combat 1 second later.</div></div><hr />
