WoW Cataclysm @ Dreamhack<br />
As you probably know, the Dreamhack Winter 2009 (http://www.dreamhack.se/dhw09) was held in Jönköping this week and people could play Cataclysm here. I never had a chance to post in-game footage of Cataclysm in the past and I thought it was a good occasion to do it since &quot;someone&quot; was nice enough to provide decent footage with a decent (=not too awful) quality, thanks to him/her/it. <br />

If I remember correctly, neither goblins nor worgen will be able to play as paladins or shaman. Sorry to burst your bubble (unless I'm wrong)<br />
<br />
Edit: I was mistaken. Goblins and Worgen share classes, with the exception of Goblins getting Shaman, while Worgen get Druids. Neither can be Paladins, however.</div></div><hr />

The reason why Thrall asks the goblins to join the horde is because in the goblin starting zone, you save Thrall after he's been captured</div></div><hr />

Worgen: Oh so dissapointed I am :( I mean look at the running animation, have you guys ever had the worgen debuff while fighting shade of arugal in grizzly hills? That's the way they should be running ^^ If they can't run that way all the time, atleast run that way with that sprint-like racial.

Yeah I agree, if you look at the convos they all mention a previous sotry, from the gomblins: He's the one that made us able to live now&quot; or such. <br />

Worgen animations look hilariously stupid though. I can only hope they are placeholders and if not, lol at worgens then.<br />

My only hope is that the rest of the game this kind of treatment. Although, with regards to the starting zones, I'm hoping that you aren't forced to play through them, so a Goblin could go and do the orc starting zones in much the same way you can now.<br />

I think the running animation is fine apart from the floppy arms. It doesn't look like he's uncomfortable or awkward so much as it looks like he's been made numb at the shoulders and they're flapping about in the wind.<br />
<br />
The same with the casting animation, the arms are too exaggerated and floaty. It's like when people are about to fall over in cartoons and they flail their arms in circles to steady themselves, except in slow motion.</div></div><hr />

it's easy to complain,<br />
but let's be honest,<br />
if you want your worgen to show it's gear when in worgen form, running on all four would never work<br />
the oversized shoulders all gear has would have bad movement, would probably clip into the head..<br />
<br />
you can be sure, everything you're complaining about, blizzard have already tried, attempted and ruled out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So because the Blood elves got a silly casting animation, we should make all new races look ridiculous? :P<br />

Also, if that's why Worgen run funny, I'd imagine they'd rather run on all fours as opposed to having their enemies laughing at their inadequacies.</div></div><hr />

There was some goblin race contest for some rewards on friday, so all those pots and food and green items you get from turning the quest in were to make the race better and faster (for those who would remember to use it) ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nekosom</div><div class="date">2009-11-29, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering both scenarios begin after some sequence we haven't seen yet, I would love if we saw a Metroid-like scenario, where you start out as a level 85 with many of your final abilities, holding off a horde of enemies in a DK-like phased zone. Then during the battle you are injured, and lose most of your powers. In the case of the Goblins, it could be a case of amnesia, while with the Worgen you could be weakened by the curse and subsequent cure. It would certainly beat starting as a level 1 that can do nothing but use one ability and beat things with a stick. I think it would serve as an appropriate tease to get new players WANTING to level up, so they can have that same awesomeness they had at the beginning.<br />
<br />
There is one thing I worry about however. Will they revamp the starting experience for other races? Just from the small peek it looks like Goblins and Worgen will at the very least have a more refined beginning experience. I'd love to see that for the other races as well. Have Gnomes and Trolls begin by taking back their home. Have humans and orcs begin by saving civilians in their capital during the Cataclysm. Night elves could...battle creatures from the Nightmare while Blood Elves fight their High Elven brethren over the Sunwell. I don't know, I'm just making this up as I go along, but it would be great if the starting experience were more epic for all involved. I don't know how much I'm getting in touch with my race by killing boars and wolves and running errands. Save such mundane tasks for when we actually care about our characters and are willing to endure the pain. Otherwise, in a year or two there will be nothing but Worgen and Goblins around. I can't count the number of toons I've abandoned before level 7 because I just couldn't take the awfulness of the starting zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I can see, I like the Worgen running animation. It's almost as if they are trying to prevent themselves from running on four legs, trying to retain as much humanity as possible when transformed into a Worgen, so it looks clumsy to others. As far as casting goes, I'm just glad I prefer melee classes ^^<br />
<br />
With the Goblins, I know that I'll roll one simply to go through their areas. The Lost Isles look friggin amazing, and their animations are just what you'd expect of them :)<br />

Blizzard took Heroic Leap from warrior away cause it was exploitable and to fix that they had to remake the whole Azeroth. And now thay are giving it to goblins as racial ability... really nice Blizztards.. really nice. <br />
<br />
Also.. I think blizzard now supports Chinese government as they are planning to give goblin a worldwide bank access..... On second thought I really do hope that they deploy this racial ability to ruin the m'fucking economy and then the whole f'ing game. Perhaps after that, I seriously mean perhaps they would frikking learn to think what they are giving access for the players.<br />
<br />
And then to worgen... <br />
<br />
Overall I like the worgen graphic.. I really liked the transformation etc<br />
But oh no.. Blizzard race developement team were high again when doing this race. Worgen racials = brutally suck ass.<br />

The animation looked funny, but did anyone else find themselves used to it by the end of the video? It seems like something I could get used to as easily as I can get used to playing a gnome character. And the transformation is simply badass.<br />
My only real qualm with Worgen is their feet. Their paws are HUGE.<br />
<br />
I like the goblins, but I will most likely avoid rolling one because I've never managed a Horde character past level 15. As well, all of the goblin male faces looked almost exactly the same. Their starting zone is also really good.</div></div><hr />

I've yet to see any people going &quot;yiff&quot; over Worgen, just a lot of people complaining about furries that I've yet to see.<br />
Worgen are based on Werewolves, which are a classic mythological figure, same as elves, goblins, or Minotaur. They're based off of something classic, but people can't help but see everyone who likes them as what is, in fact, a small population on the internet. Christ, people who play elves aren't accused of having an &quot;ear fetish&quot;. People who play trolls aren't accused of having a &quot;tusk fetish&quot;, why is it that people who will play Worgen will be accused of having a &quot;fur fetish&quot;?<br />
<br />
And the new model is there for playability and customization. The old worgen models had almost no room for change and would have looked completely idiotic wearing, say, a full suit of armor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are NOT the starting zone!!! If you look well at the video in HD, you will see that in both cases, they are level 6 ( and they have powers of a caracter lvl 6 ).<br />
So Blizzard is not yet willing to revel the &quot; real &quot; starting zones<br />
<br />
<br />
I think You are wrong. On the first info about new races Blizzard says they begin at level 6. Check old MMO info about Cataclysm</div></div><hr />

Actually, the characters starting at lvl6 was deliberately there, so that the Lore and whatnot from levels 1 to 6 were kept a suprise.</div></div><hr />

Ok, for the ones who haven't figure it out...about races looks, what the Horde has that the Alliance doesn't? BIG beasts , ...what the Alliance has that Horde doesn't?? small people.<br />
<br />
If you people haven't figure it out yet, Worgens are meant to be the Taurens of the Alliance and Goblins the Gnomes of the Horde, what does it mean?<br />
<br />
Alliance now has a race with the same slow motion running , camara problems in tunnels, and other problems the Tauren have, but you learn to deal with it because you love your beast.<br />
<br />
Horde now has a race with the same advantages gnomes have , like pissing off people , hard to target in bgs , and other things gnome are so loved for in their faction and hated in the other.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is the reason why those 2 race, one small one big.<br />
<br />

I would honestly hope they did. The only realistic fur options are brown, black, grey and white. If they were missing ANY of those, Worgen would be missing some major customization options.<br />

On topic: I'll admit the casting animation of the worgen looks .... odd, but I still love the race its self. I'm especially going to have fun playing on just to annoy several /b/ tards because I hate them more than &quot;furries&quot; that seem to be the bane of their existence.</div></div><hr />

One flaw there; homosexuality is beginning to become more socially accepted in society, but it's not like everyone is becoming gay because of it. Bestiality is a preference far more rare than homosexuality, do you really think that would happen?<br />
Back on track, Worgen =/= furfags or twilight fans. They're a fantasy creature, just like elves or goblins. Just because of a small population out there and a book series, that whole race is taking an unnecessarily hard beating. It's not quite fair.</div></div><hr />

The question here is: Do you really think I was serious? :P<br />

Personally, all the unnecessary beating I dish out here is aimed at those who will create a Worgen to appease their perverse fantasies or contaminate the awesomeness that is Wolfmen by associating them with a writings of a sexually oppressed woman. <br />

I like who ever said something about them being uncomfortable in their new forms, granted, they wont be uncomfortable with their forms by the time we hit 85, its still....interesting I guess. I think if they toned down the arm flailing just a pinch they'd be fine.<br />

Also, Im very excited for both races, and will definately be rolling 1 of both. :)</div></div><hr />

I can't wait to make both a Goblin and Worgen. I think the Goblins are amazing looking, so far. And, both starting areas look incredible. I'm a little disappointed with the Worgen, though. Their run/walk animations just seem overly hulking. I expect them to have a bit of a heavy footed walk/run, because of what they are. But, it's a bit extreme right now. They're far too hunched over and they look clumsy and silly, rather than feral and fierce. Hopefully this is something that's being taken into mind, though, and worked on. And, chances are, by the time the expansion hits, their animations could look entirely different. <br />
<br />
And, the water looks superb! I can't wait to see the way Azeroth changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah, but Dranei are not big as Taurens, they have no camara problems in tunnels, or doors , and don't look like they run in slow motion.<br />
Now there are Worgens which are just like Taurens , big and even look slow when they run lol , and are real beasts, (dranei are not beasts they are just aliens) <br />
<br />
So, I stick with what I said:<br />
<br />
Worgen = Tauren (beasts with slow motion running feeling, camara problems,easy target in bgs, but you learn to deal with it)<br />

I saw this all over the place after BC came out. It died down, and now a lot of people who would have said that now agree that female draenei are the prettiest characters in game. A lot of people still think they're ugly, but that's a personal preference; I never see the goat fetish thing anymore, though.<br />
Worgen are a different story in that they are actually tied to wolves in appearance, but I'm almost positive the whole &quot;furry&quot; argument will die down within a couple weeks of Cataclysm.<br />

<br />
My only gripe is that I wish Blizz would allow race changes to Worgen/Goblins at launch. There's little incentive to put more time into my Priest if I have to start from scratch (to play Worgen) and ditch all my mounts, titles, etc. :(</div></div><hr />

Although the racials have me kinda concerned atm in the over powered depeartment but I'll wait to see what happens to every other racial before I make my mind up. As for the worgen as much as I like the look of the new ones and the fur tones avilable, the walking animation is looking to be the only nice thing about them. The jump seems strange, casting is horrid (was hoping to see more of a feirce casting) and the speed boost should really make them go on all fours (And yes people will say there trying to be more human or what ever but do you see a bear running on two feet?) And as much as the transformation looks great I would preffer a permanent worgen form, transforming looks more of a gimmik (I have no idea what bennifets are gained from it so please do tell) The other concern I have is worgen druids, do they have to transform to a worgen to transform to somthing else? if so then &quot;hey we heard you like to transform!

<br />
What really counts is game mechanics and those have not changed a bit so far (at least in the videos/demos). What I am really curious about is the new/modified zones, new skills, modified talent trees, the whole guild achievement stuff and of course the character streamlining process.<br />

Why is everyone so f**king excited about that crap? You spend a couple of hours at most in the starting zone and never come back. And who pays attention to character animation after a couple hours playing? It's still the same game!<br />
<br />
What really counts is game mechanics and those have not changed a bit so far (at least in the videos/demos). What I am really curious about is the new/modified zones, new skills, modified talent trees, the whole guild achievement stuff and of course the character streamlining process.<br />
<br />
When it comes to it, WoW is about 2 things: character leveling and endgame (PvE/PvP).<br />
<br />
<br />
*shrug* Different people, different values. Who are you to say what counts and who does not count in terms of enjoyment for others?</div></div><hr />

They are werewolves, they aren't SUPPOSE to move like a normal person. That transformation? Badass! I can't wait to roll one! Not sure what class yet tho. Also I am actually relieved that they made them look totally different from the already ingame models...because they are NOT the same &quot;brand&quot; of Worgen, so making them look the same would just be silly. Goblins..meh. I am so over the short races. Would be funny as hell tho to see a Goblin and Gnome duelling. Awwww, look at the lil guys scrapping!</div></div><hr />

Obvious is obvious<br />
<br />
<br />
even more obvious is people like new things. :o<br />
<br />
you are very good at stating the obvious which everyone knows already but you are not good at seeing the obvious.</div></div><hr />

Really?.. I mean really? Horde who have all the coolest armor sets in the game, and Alliance who's armor sets are comparable to Corky from Life Goes On.<br />

I think goblins look badass, and I am for sure making a female goblin lock named Broccoli or asparagus or something :)<br />

Not sure who in there right mind would chose anything but worgen now when the Xpac comes.<br />
<br />
By minor i mean, cleaning up some awkward battle animations / running animations that exist. Maybe redo the human face to look more fleshed out like King umm Varyian? &lt;--fail i know.<br />
<br />
One change i'd like to see is somehow with the death of arthas it somehow effects the power of sylvanas and her people allowing them to look more &quot;fleshy&quot;, less bones, maybe more &quot;vampirish&quot;? I honestly think they could've done so much more for the horde models to make them look more badass and less fugly without necessarily ruining any of the classic lore.</div></div><hr />

I thought there was mention of being able to choose, but that certainly wasn't indicated in these videos. I wish we had more than just concept art of the female Worgen, but I hope the fact that there isn't anything yet means they are working very hard at perfecting it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I very much agree about the human form issue. I really hope that when Cataclysm hits shelves, that such an option will be available. Even though, I don't intend to use my human form often, I truly do hope that I, at least, have a say in the matter of what that side of my toon will look like. I'd prefer to not have it decided for me.<br />
<br />
And, I hope so the same thing about the Worgen females. Hopefully, they're working really hard to make them look just right. And, even more so, hopefully they won't be nearly as hunched over or hulking as the males currently appear to be, when they run/walk. I expect and welcome the idea of the Worgen being heavy footed and having a bit of a hulking and hunched over walk/run and general appearance. But, I'd just prefer them not look so clumsy and Frankenstein-like. They seem very goofy to me, right now, when they walk/run and it looks silly, rather than feral. <br />
<br />
But, there's a lot of time left, before the expansion is even released. So, I'm sure that these are things that are being worked on and chances are, the Worgen animations will be greatly changed by the time it comes out.</div></div><hr />

#1 They've said you'll get to customize both, so relax.<br />
<br />
#2 Females are always given the most aesthetically pleasing model possible. I do hope that the males will retain some of the savagery in their posture and gait, without being so ridiculously exaggerated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Agreed. It looks to heavy and chaotic. That's why I never ever played draeneis or orcs because I think they're too heavy, also female humans...<br />
<br />
I like lightish animations like gnomes and undeads...</div></div><hr />

Yes you do get to customize your human form. Its been mentioned by blizzard i believe. At the moment the rumors going around are thatt 1-5 is a flash back of when your still human. At that moment you design your human.</div></div><hr />
