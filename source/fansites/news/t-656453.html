Yeah Kungen's quote was super sleazy. I like how he claimed that no one cared about anything after algalon... which clearly is not the case given the massive attention given to stars (and previously, exo) in these cases. Considering they DRAW A SALARY TO PLAY A GAME, their response is pretty ridiculous, but entertaining nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's because they're treated like second-class &quot;citizens&quot; of Azeroth with patches. Now I assume that Blizzard doesn't do that intentionally and there's probably some reason as to why they get their patches at least a week later than EU/US, but it does put Stars in a bind with regards to the world-first race which they want to be a part of.<br />
<br />
Or maybe it's just because people consider them an exotic guild containing players outside of the demographic EU/US players are used to.</div></div><hr />

sorry ensidia is awsome , but from the stars kill they are currently #2 in my book.<br />

sorry if you want to be the best you have to step up your game ensidia, and dont come up with lame excuses like .. ooh the boss was boring , it just <br />

LOL! But as to my understanding, it's true that Chinese ARE big AMD enthusiasts, ;D especially among geeks , since in China most geeks DIY their PCs. <br />

Well this is actually first time I realize Stars get some sponsorship , too. But same as Ensidia, I bet most members of their guild won't get any money for playing...the sponsors' money mostly goes for websites and maybe a new CPU every year? ! ??? :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Kungen 1 day, 5 hours<br />
<br />
The main race in Ulduar was always Algalon and nothing else. Once he was dead the motivation to finish another hard mode that isn't even in the Heroic: Glory of the Raider kinda goes down by a few million miles.<br />
<br />
The only reason people make such a huge deal about these kills is because we didn't kill it and that's about it. People always URGE to bash on the current top guild and that's life. It's been the same for about 4 years now.<br />
<br />
Some facts: We never ever said it was mathematically impossible or just impossible because it was so hard. I have no clue who made that up, probably the same people that make up shit about us exploiting things in the past. The only reason we haven't progressed on it is because our members weren't motivated to do so with new content just around the corner and Algalon already being dead.<br />
<br />
I respect Stars a lot for pushing so hard on Yogg 0 watcher and it's quite an accomplishment. But saying they are the best because they killed a boss that we and many other top guilds didn't even bother with is kinda over the top. Especially when the race of Ulduar already was over. I'm sure &quot;fans&quot; of the other guilds want to believe that the &quot;RACE IS STILL ON (METHOD STYLE)&quot; but really it wasn't.<br />
<br />
But big grats to Stars once again for pushing it so hard!<br />
<br />
Now all jealous and bitter people go ahead and make more new accounts to bash us<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, the red line is just vintage Kungen, isn't it ? :P ;D ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok , one thing they proved their worth in the wow world and actually showed with their tactics that math is all there is , they finely tuned it because of math!(check out what stars is telling in their post , they redid the math dumbwit! ). get it ?. however the EJ guys or wherever those rumors( truth be told i have only heard it from the top guilds with no sense of proof ) got from was just plain wrong.<br />

its just numbers and it can all be calculated no matter what vodoo priestess you belive in , however you need to account for all the variables, but missing out on important variables like locks doing shit with their eyes closed is a sin.</div></div><hr />

Well, the red line is just vintage Kungen, isn't it ? :P ;D ;D<br />

<br />
He's right though.<br />
<br />
Did most guild say<br />
<br />
1. Algalon <br />
or<br />
2. Yogg-saron with 0 watchers<br />
<br />
is the main goal when ulduar went live? Yeah that's right, 1.<br />
And since it was stated early on that yogg+0 was impossible (&quot;impossible&quot;), most top guilds didn't even bother trying to claim the world first. That is their own fault though. As I've said before, big gratz to Stars.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, and therefor the main goal was always Algalon. It's understandable that motivation wasn't so high after Algalon.</div></div><hr />

Still its quite incredible that ensidia says now that its still not a big deal for them , and since the boss is so boring they probably wont try that much and is going PTR to get a headstart on the next easy bosses. even when they have the strat + video. its pathetic tbh. atleast for a guild who glooms themselves in the #1 spot.<br />
<br />
they will always be remembered for this , no matter how many guilds they beat in the future. spineless, because ..ooh its booring.</div></div><hr />

They just though its impossible, and now even another guild got the kill thanks to Stars not being assholes and releasing strategy. Ensidia can go suck their thumbs, since Paragon proved its possible with a good strat. Excuses like &quot;We didnt feel motivated&quot; are lame, since it is the hardest encounter in WoW. If its not, how come many beaten Algalon, and only 2 Alone in the dark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- A majority of players consider Ensidia to be the top guild in the world.<br />
- They get paid to play World of Warcraft.<br />
- Ensidia purposely exploited Hodir Hard Mode, and 'immediately reported' the issue. This exploit, unlike their ex-Nihilums supposed 'accidental' Vashj bug, required premeditated planning.<br />
- Exodus isn't a fun guild to flame, because they trolled on purpose and they're too cool to care. <br />
- Stars was behind Ensidia on several 'World First' kills in Ulduar, and they recieved their releases after Ensidia (WoW Europe).<br />
- Stars was not credited on several progress tracking sites, such as wowprogress.com.<br />
- Stars wasn't even in the minds of people for Yogg+0, as all the attention had been on Exodus (US) vs Ensidia (EU).<br />
- Ensidia said the encounter was 'mathematically impossible'. Elitist Jerks did not. <br />
- Stars not only proved the 'top guild' in the world wrong, but they're outside the whole &quot;US vs EU&quot; argument that has persisted since Exodus.<br />
- Many people had the mindset that Stars would actually be ahead of Ensidia if they recieved their releases at the same time, and if they were in the same timezone. This has been true long before WotLK, when Stars downed Illidan in a much shorter time frame than Ensidia (some of them were pictured still wearing T3 gear, and I believe it was three weeks after their Burning Crusade release, where Black Temple and all prior raid instances were included), though this didn't recieve too much attention as it came several months after - and the fact that there have been several strategies made for Illidan including videos.</div></div><hr />

Would like to know this as well. I've also seen a hunter (in an algalon kill video I think) with a similar mod. Anyone know what the name(s) of this/these mod(s) are?<br />
<br />
Also huge grats to stars, and as others have said, alot of people have lost respect for ensidia for how they have reacted to being #2.<br />
<br />
Edit: is that mod also able to be configured/used by hunters? The one hunter in the video I'm thinking of had one that showed the shot rotation based on priority as well as showing the cooldown timers / dot durations.</div></div><hr />

This same thing happened back when Stars came out of nowhere and destroyed KJ in record time. Nihilum just laughed at it and said it was because &quot;strategies were leaked&quot; when none were around that I had ever heard of. It's easy to claim the race was to Algalon when Ensidia was beating on him before Stars even had access to Wrath. For christ sake, they had to move to the TW servers to even play Wrath.<br />
<br />
And Stars did one thing Ensidia would never do. They made no fanfare about attempting it, beat it, and then promptly told the strategy. &quot;Here's how we did it, go try it yourselves.&quot; And now look, Paragon is higher in ranking, haha.<br />

<br />
Because I am tired of seeing same name over and over on top.<br />
<br />
Because of their attitude when they lost the hardest encounter, which takes insane tactic, not just plain brute force zerg.<br />
<br />
Because Stars dont get all cocky by beating the hardest encounter in WoW.<br />
<br />
Because Stars are cool to help community by releasing tactic :D<br />

Ensidia would bite dust if Stars had access to Wotlk at same time as they did, as they just proved by beating Yogg +0.</div></div><hr />

Ok then using drain soul (a finisher move) at the start of the phase when the boss is no where near dead and doing bonus damage becuase of the health modifiyer...

Um, yeah, thats is kinda the point of skill. Stop your trolling, you think if executing was cheating, blizz wouldn't fixed it for bosses already? They are not banned, so the kill is fine by Blizz. Butthurt Ensidia fanboy is butthurt :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like a lot of people I dislike the attitude that Ensidia have displayed regarding said feat, but I don't really see a reason to hate them for it.<br />
<br />
As for who is the better PvE guild, I would still say Ensidia as they have been there for a long time and Stars getting world first on Yogg+0 does not nullify those past feats.<br />
<br />
Until we see a comparative race between Ensidia and Stars, I find it difficult to be 100% sure who really IS the best. Let them start on some new content at the exact same time and the one who finish first will be the #1 PvE guild.</div></div><hr />

(Yeah i know one might say ...&quot; but they had all the tactics&quot;... but look at this kill it exactly prooves that they dont need other ppls tactics)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There is no exploit using this spell. He's &quot;no where near dead&quot; like you say, but check his %.<br />
If I'm not wrong, Drain Soul acts like Execute with %. If boss is at a certain % you can use it. No Exploit indeed.<br />
<br />
&quot;No where near dead&quot; means he has roughly 15-16 million HP in this phase, but out of his HUGE HP Pool, he's near death :)<br />
3 Days ago Starts killed him, and they used warlocks also using this, Paragon used the same ability and successfully killed him.<br />
<br />
I can be wrong, but every &quot;top&quot; guild attempting this boss from now on, since there is not 1 specific tactic to do him (Paragon said they had their own tactic!), they'll have for sure 1 Blizzard employer checking their attempts and see if they exploit it, like Athene had on his quick levelling time.</div></div><hr />

Also..me myself got overall 1000 deaths in dungeouns while progressing with my guild since wotlk....the mt of these guys just died 700 times on yogg+0 ..... ::)<br />
<br />
Since everything what Ensidia archieved....its summer and since they killed Algalon ,they maybe just want to take a break and enjoy sweet summertime like normal human beeings ;)<br />
<br />
I can imagine that these guys are just burned out now...or they are just really nolifers ...1month everyday atleast 700 wipes :D I mean when you cannot beat an encounter after 700 attempts you should quit wow ...<br />

Big kudos to them, as well as to ensidia, if they are able to get paid (a little bit) for playing a game - unlike the other 11 mio players out there. GJ<br />
<br />
One man who is #2 DPS of Stars in the battle, is a senior manager of AMDchina .<br />

<br />
Like a lot of people I dislike the attitude that Ensidia have displayed regarding said feat, but I don't really see a reason to hate them for it.<br />
<br />
As for who is the better PvE guild, I would still say Ensidia as they have been there for a long time and Stars getting world first on Yogg+0 does not nullify those past feats.<br />
<br />
Until we see a comparative race between Ensidia and Stars, I find it difficult to be 100% sure who really IS the best. Let them start on some new content at the exact same time and the one who finish first will be the #1 PvE guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
yea stars has been an amazing guild since vanilla (world first gothik). you must not know what you are talking about seeing how much of a disadvantage they are at and how fast they progress when they do get content</div></div><hr />

Person B is running a extra round after became second, now hes running in slowmotion with his left leg behind his head and after days he managed the 100meters he claims the gold medal....got me ?^^<br />
<br />
I bet if Ensidia even was interested and tried that hard for this &quot;special round&quot; (one leg behind the head u remember) they did it in less then half of the time, thinks of Mimiron hm.<br />
<br />

I'll paint you another picture. <br />
<br />
It is like Roddick wanting to be named Champion of Wimbeldon, despite losing to Federer in the final. After all he has never won against Federer at Wimbeldon and has shit loads of losses and just 2 wins overall against Roger, so he can claim it is impossible for him to beat Federer. <br />
<br />
Or if you prefer WoW analogy - then Nihilum should stop bragging about clearing Naxx first since Kel'Thuzad was their only world first in there. Talking about vanilla WoW of course. <br />
<br />
Finally i like how most Ensidia fanbois have short memory when it comes to defending their guild. Seriously doesn't anyone remember they stated during start of Ulduar progression that their main goal was getting Yogg easy mode, Algalon and Yogg 0-keeper world first. Trying to diminish the importance of the latter after not being able to get it is quite crappy attitude. <br />
<br />
The only fact is that Stars completed Ulduar first so they won the race this time, admit it and just prove in the next one you are better.</div></div><hr />

No offence, but in 10 years you will get a &quot;Wait, what game?&quot; back as answer. <br />

Not to mention that being best is not equal to being most popular. Ensidia got most first kills over past years and got far more publicity. Yet Stars are leading now in PvE.</div></div><hr />

For the past, we all know who is the best. But who knows sure for the future, things change and nothing lasts forever. With this kind of attitude, it is dangerous, especially for the Ensidia members. Don't live in the past, future is more important. And attitude decides.</div></div><hr />

Geez, I thought you &quot;peaced out&quot; already.<br />
<br />
It's pretty amazing what people will pull out of their ass to defend some lost cause. I personally adored Ensidia, and I still do, but regardless of reason - or excuses for that matter, one simple truth remains: Stars got 0 keeper while Ensidia claimed it was impossible to do. Stars are no lifers? Ensidia is more &quot;l33t&quot; in skills? Ensidia won because they had Algalon first and lost motivation? IT DOESN'T MATTER. WoW progression is measured in one thing and one thing alone: did you down the boss first? Stars did, and that makes them better, at least for the time being.<br />
<br />
Again, Ensidia is, without a doubt, a great, if not the greatest guild in WoW, but people like you who cannot admit defeat - however minor this defeat may be, will eventually hurt Ensidia.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right and when guilds like LR and EJ spend less time/tries on a boss you say it is because they had the tactic handed out to them.<br />
<br />
Get over yourself Stars won the race in Ulduar fair and square and can really claim they are currently the top guild. To use another sport analogy - if you win an Olympic gold medal you are the champion until the next Olympics. So until 3.2 Stars are the top guild. <br />
<br />
Of course there is the minor inconvenience that the PvE race can never be fair with the way instances are released, but there isn't much one can do about it. The current case is an exception as the guild that got access last won it. <br />
<br />
As for which the best guild is - that is impossible to determine. It is totally personal preference. There are too many factors to consider in order for one to make totally unbiased conclusion.</div></div><hr />

The RL of stars said ,he though they tried no more than 600 times on Yogg-Saron+0<br />
And , as the had already down alg on june 9 , that means the had at least a whole month to try on Yogg-Saron+0<br />
<br />
no more than 600 times in more than one month, 10+ times per day , that is not too much.<br />
<br />
PS duel to server problems , the can only raid from 23:00+ to 4-5:00 next morning, that is really unbelievable..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jin84</div><div class="date">2009-07-13, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this guild wiped atleast 700 times on that hardmode....they are not better they just had more people willing to wipe that much as i said before Ensidia would manage this in less then half of the trys...<br />
<br />
700 wipes a atleast 10 minutes + running back 3 or 5 min in....10500 minutes = 175hours = 7.29666666666666666 days <br />
<br />
so they had a raw progression time of 7 days....hello?! Like i said before...gratz on beeing that stoic but that not make em better at all.....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Newsflash: Your idol Kungen said they did not bother to pursue Yogg+0, because Algalon was already in the bag. This was already very disappointing in itself. And Stars came up with their own strategy, that's why they got the first kill of Yogg+0.<br />
<br />
lolfanboyism.<br />
<br />
FYI, I was one of those who respected Kungen, until I saw his fail of a &quot;gratz&quot; to Stars.</div></div><hr />

rofl....so I am a racist by saying china got a communist regime who shoots people and put em in jail for nothing ...interresting. Such bullshit can say just some1 whos totally retarded and brainwashed or some1 whos insolved by himself in such things.<br />
<br />
Like I said they spend 7 days raw progression time on that encounter...every decent top5 guild that spent so much time would finally pick up the right strategy but that makes them NOT better then any other guild top 5...<br />
<br />
Show us some other WFs in the next year and I would say yes thats a nr1 guild...<br />
<br />
but NOT for 1 kill which was just based on time investment...<br />
so again gratz for beeing that stoic ;)</div></div><hr />

Although you are trying very hard trolling around, but you are just spending lots of time posting idiotic posts here... Show us some brainy comments, and I would say yes you are the No1 troll on board.<br />
<br />
But gratz for being that stoic . ;D</div></div><hr />

Thats for like 99% of the Stars fan posts try to bash Ensidia, show some fooking respect for what they archieved,....you aint got shit untill you proove some more wfs in the next months,.....untill that this the kill on yogg+0 was just pure time investment in my opinion...be happy with one small piece of the Ensidia / Method cake and keep trying.<br />
<br />
and bringing out the strat so early...help the community ? LOL they just beeing selfish, prevented that someelse can step up without beeing insulted using the stars strat, i call that foulplay....<br />
<br />
Dont you guys wonder Ensidia and Method didnt even tried ? Showed me alot about their belief in their own skills and abilitys that they can proove everytime and to anyone whos number1 in the world.<br />
<br />
Every topguild in the past, waited atleast 2 weeks to give others a chance to find it out by themselfs. Mimiron hardmode comes in my mind with an 18days delay by Stars ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: and liupang....i dont care about what anyone from the internet thinks of me over a dieing mmo anyway...I got my beautiful wife my art and my friends...thats all what counts for me. If you cant stand the facts that this kill was all about a time investment of atleast 7 raw ingame days, dont insult me for trolling.</div></div><hr />
