Armory Stats - Player Raid Completion Rates<br />
Today we are taking a look at the overall raid completion rate of players. Now that achievements are account wide, we can group characters by account and get an idea of what percentage of players (not characters) have completed a raid at least once, based on earning the achievement for the final wing. <br />
<br />
The data used today is a sample from 6.3 million characters from 2.5 million accounts. The sample is slightly biased, as players who are not in a guild are much less likely to appear in our sample. You can leave suggestions for future stat posts in the comments!<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Raid Finder<br />
GC, lack of tanks has to be one of the main problems you guys need to work on - 45+ min LFR queue as DPS, is just not cool. <br />
It seems to have gotten worse with 5.4. We're looking at the data to try to understand what's going on. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/389858726368145409))<br />
If you want to know why there is less tanks. Please tank a lfr and you will have your answers.<br />
If that was the only issue, it would likely be a gradual decline not a sudden drop at 5.4. That implies it's flex (or a bug). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390986088149286912))<br />
<br />
then take a look at it before you say it doesnt guarantee everything.<br />
There are guys in LFR doing 10K dps because they don't realize that e.g. you should use abilities as fast as you can. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388719648419487744))<br />
In that environment, being able to do any kind of PG will help teach that player how WoW combat should really be played. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388719876665126912))<br />
And yet the enrage timers in SoO LFR are tuned as though this was not the case.<br />
Hitting enrage timers in LFR is nearly always a lack of understanding the mechanics rather than just low DPS. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388836780968906752))<br />
That's still on us to fix, but we'd rather not just dial down all the mechanics until you can just ignore them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388836864125202433))<br />
My concern and experience is that SoO LFR seems to be tuned for a level of skill and gear that the mode no longer attracts.<br />
The feedback was very similar for ToT LFR until players knew the fights better. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/389108952371171328))<br />
<br />
No PG experience can be a substitute for the 10 years of raiding that many of us have, but it can serve as an introduction. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388720061407432704))<br />
Did i get you wrong that it should be an additional prerequisite? Or would it either be ilevel or pgs?<br />
Yeah, we would never require PGs for LFR. It would just be a way to demonstrate that you didn't need the ilevel. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388839274788831232))<br />
<br />
Just heard the best description of LFR &quot;If someone tells me to eat a pile of crap for $10 million, I'll eat the pile of crap&quot;<br />
I get that, but there are also heroic raiders who get bored once the loot stops rolling it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388720423463944192))<br />
So you can't just argue that every activity must be so fun that the rewards don't play into someone's desire to do it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388720578632232960))<br />
<br />
Please don't remove the ability to enter LFR purely on iLevel. Forcing PG medal would effectively shut off LFR for too many.<br />
The idea I floated, and Olivia even referenced, was PG letting you enter with a lower ilevel because you know what you're doing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388435203690991616))<br />
<br />
what is the future for lfr now you have split its community in two with flex raiding. it seems from in game play lfr is done.<br />
LFR is still more popular than flex. However we think flex will be more fun for many of our players so we don't mind some transition (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/387970442624892928))<br />
<br />
Why is kick protection a thing? having people do nothing and be toxic intentionally is rather frustrating<br />
It was originally to protect folks in 5-player content from e.g. being kicked so they couldn't roll on loot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/391326436029505536))<br />
We are considering that kick rules might be too strict on 25-player LFR, where one toxic player can affect a bunch of others. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/391326607974998017))<br />
<br />
I dont understand why people get so hyped about LFD being unsocial. It isnt.Without it, only a few would see content<br />
It's pretty unsocial but it still serves a valuable purpose. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/390983634145923072))<br />
<br />
Class Balance Discussion<br />
there are dozens of fan sites for that. The entire point of having an official forum is to talk to the devs directly.<br />
Just to be clear, that is not our goal for the official forums. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388726401563521024))<br />
question and run stats on the collected data. Allows massive and robust sample.<br />
Agreed, but it has one massive downside, in that there is no back and forth discussion among players, which I really value. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388836093690269697))<br />
Regardless, the forums serve two purposes: people complaining to Blizzard; people trolling those people.<br />
While that exists, I find that view a little cynical. There are good discussions with a lot of back and forth as well. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/389109872668577792))<br />
We learn a lot when there is back and forth between two sides, especially if we can ascertain why they feel a certain way. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/389111565359656960))<br />
<br />
I always see the same people trolling for nerfs and crusading against certain classes. Everyone Is OP except me<br />
As a team, we're a lot more interested in fun than balance. It's just for some players they are tightly connected. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388834025302810624))<br />
And of course fun is subjective, so one can't just play the &quot;X isn't fun for me - change it&quot; card. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/388834182954102784))<br />
That there is too much content that requires balance and not enough content that encourages variety?<br />
It's concern, but we're a lot better at making the &quot;balance&quot; content than we are the &quot;variety&quot; content. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/391326138498158592))<br />

<br />

<br />
Just US and EU. Comparing the different difficulties is slightly harder since you can't use achievements anymore, but I am going to look into using the kill counts that you see at the bottom of armory profiles to do so. Not sure how accurate they are, as there are fun bugs like Paragon kills never showing up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good lord, where did all of the raiders go? Would be interesting to see current sub numbers.<br />
<br />
I shared some incomplete US numbers (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlhGFxXGEsQadHQ0YjJZX2J0eml0RC1fUDJEbFdJWFE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0) a week or so ago if that would be of interest. The DB has already added another 100k characters since then though, so keep that in mind when looking at them.<br />
<br />
As far as where the raiders are, most can't complete Siege of Orgrimmar on Raid Finder yet, as the last wing isn't open. The last wing just opened on flex this week, so most flex raiders may not have done it yet. The previous raids have had months of time and cross realm groups going on for a while now, which is also part of why they are higher.</div></div><hr />

(and now i see you referenced that yourself in your comment :p)</div></div><hr />

This makes sense. Thanks for sharing the document.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's the latter, then I think there is little reason to be concerned at the moment. Mostly because LFR wont show up yet (Wing 4 unlocks on 22nd) and Flex has only been open for 1 week. Since this is where the bulk of the raid-base is now, I'm not shocked by that chart. If it still looks like that by Christmas, then we need new underwear (or at least show this to people that claim raiding is easier than ever), but right now? Nah. <br />
<br />
However, since achievements are date-stamped, can you compare &quot;completion&quot; rates based on time since release? Such as, how many 100%'d ToT by 15th of April, since that would be more reflective of the SoO figures as a comparion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good lord, where did all of the raiders go? Would be interesting to see current sub numbers.<br />
It is interesting. Was LFR really just an example of a new feature and the holding power of such or are there other things going on. Players can also skip ToT now and could not for vaults. Despite this Blizzard reduced some alternative content options and placed more importance on doing ToT for rep and long term engagement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My toons are guilded but in different bank guilds of mine. If I had shared achievements enabled, could you still connect them to the same account?<br />
An easier or alternative way to connect characters to an account, are the shown battle pets. They are the same for every account and therefore for the character - regardless of the achievements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess it could have been clearer, but for this I just used the achievement that included the last boss, assuming that players are able to kill the ones that come before the last few. <br />
<br />
I'll come back and update this chart again at some point in a few months to see how things have changed (if I remember!).<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'll try and see what I can do about player completion dates. Character completion dates are much easier! Added the quick output for that below.<br />

How are characters gathered and how does being in a guild ties into that?<br />
<br />
My toons are guilded but in different bank guilds of mine. If I had shared achievements enabled, could you still connect them to the same account?<br />
An easier or alternative way to connect characters to an account, are the shown battle pets. They are the same for every account and therefore for the character - regardless of the achievements.<br />
<br />
As long as shared achievements are on they will show up as belonging to the same player. I started with a sample of characters we used in Cataclysm, updated all of them, updated all of their guilds, went through auctions a few times to get more guilds. I would imagine this caught a significant number of players, but it will likely take another month or so to get an even better sample.<br />
<br />
I don't use pets right now as only ~2% of characters have account wide achievements off, so they just aren't included in any samples.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ive stopped tanking lfrs cause i got fed up with all the bitching from retarded dps that go all out on everything and often before the tanks even have a proper chance to get agro wich cause the tarded dps to get all the agro and die and the moaning and bitching starts, i know plenty of tanks that tanks raids with their guilds without any problems but they also stopped tanking lfrs for the same reason as me.<br />
<br />
why should us tanks queue up just to get constant abuse from retards? and the majority of the tards is from kazzak..</div></div><hr />

Very much this. I've killed the Paragons three times now, and Garrosh once, but due to the armory bug not listing the Klaxxi kills I've got under my belt, it's listing me at only about 83% completion of SoO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does your armory show that you earned Downfall (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8462-downfall)?<br />
<br />
<br />
i think its to due with soo not being completed in LFR yet, and its still a new raid, most guilds are probably still struggling on normal<br />
<br />
WoWProgress only shows ~4k guilds that have completed it. I have only come across 123k characters that have Downfall (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8462-downfall) and 508k characters that have The Underhold (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/8461-the-underhold).</div></div><hr />

The guy is probably just pointing to 80% of player base is pretty much LFR's. So since that boss isn't out yet the charts looks funky. Now next week when you run it there will be a huge jump</div></div><hr />

It says completed a raid on any difficulty. First of all LFR difficulty is not included for SoO but is on all of the others. Secondly some people will consider part 1,2,3 of SoO each its own seperate raid that should count. It would be clearer if you titled it % of players who have killed final raid boss on any difficulty.</div></div><hr />

it released this week on flex, its only lfr its not released on. but its early in the patch, most guilds still havn't killed him on normal im betting, do this graph in a few months and it will look different.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how accurate they are, as there are fun bugs like Paragon kills never showing up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I shared some incomplete US numbers (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlhGFxXGEsQadHQ0YjJZX2J0eml0RC1fUDJEbFdJWFE&amp;usp=drive_web#gid=0) a week or so ago if that would be of interest. The DB has already added another 100k characters since then though, so keep that in mind when looking at them.<br />
<br />
As far as where the raiders are, most can't complete Siege of Orgrimmar on Raid Finder yet, as the last wing isn't open. The last wing just opened on flex this week, so most flex raiders may not have done it yet. The previous raids have had months of time and cross realm groups going on for a while now, which is also part of why they are higher.<br />
<br />
So then why release such a premature graph if you know all those sources of error? That just skews the data and makes it look a lot worse than it really is... why not just wait another week or two?</div></div><hr />

I blame the community not the player honestly. IF we has a community enforce people actually having to play their toons (vote kick like crazy anybody sub 50k dps, people in current raid tier with no gems/enchants) then we will actually have a change in the community as these players would get fed up with always being kicked after 1 fight in LFR. <br />

I've done my share of kicking trolls and bums from LFRs. Unfortunately, something was messed up when 5.3 was released that rendered a lot of people unable to initiate vote-kicks whatsoever (yay 2/4 hr error). This resulted in an increased tolerance for bad players because what else are you to do if you can't vote-kick? Leave the LFR and hope you don't get an hour-long queue or more?<br />
<br />
The error has mostly gone away in patch 5.4, thankfully, but I've a hunch we'll be feeling the effects caused by 5.3 for a good while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aren't DPS and heals also fed up with LFR? Why are tanks so much more fed up than the other roles?<br />
<br />
I've tanked LFR and I'd say it's actually the easiest of the three. I suspect the real issue is you can't afk as a tank. Also considering their near-zero queue times a lot of tanks are kind of prima donnas.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blur4stuff</div><div class="date">2013-10-21, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">tanks have more responsibility. dps and heals are easier to play with more room for error. also, you'll notice that older lfr raids don't have as bad of a tank problem. it's easier to do content as an undergeared dps or healer than a tank.<br />
<br />
without making tanking easier, the only way you're gonna get more tanks into lfr is to provide incentive. the cta bonus bag isn't nearly enough since it's usually just a little gold and a useless item. if the cta bag had a significantly higher chance at rare items with a higher gold reward it would help. it also needs guaranteed spirits of harmony, not motes. toss in bonus valor and justice for good measure.<br />

if that's not good enough then one way to erase the tanking problem is to add items to the cta bag that are no longer obtainable. items that were never obtainable in the game to begin with, too. if you put asian only pets in there, blizzard event rewards from the past, etc... the tank issue would disappear.</div></div><hr />

Or they could make tanking fun, instead of lazily throwing useless rewards out to try and bribe us. It's a game, you play it to have fun not to do something you don't want to do because there might be a mount in the bag.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, not sure what purpose there is of even putting that chart up there. It just begs to be misinterpreted. Flex has only been out for a short time, and LFR not at all. This chart should have been put up the week before 5.4, or else waited another month. The only thing it really shows is how few people raid compared to how many do LFR.<br />

<br />
But really, if anything, this graph should be a huge b-slap at those people who want LFR removed. What this graph does show is that the vast majority of people clearing a boss, are doing it on LFR. If they removed LFR, then the dev time that would be devoted to raiding would be slashed significantly to match the % as seen on this chart for SoO<br />

<br />
The whole irony of LFR and vote-kicking is pretty much the only people I ever see get kicked out are tanks.<br />
<br />
We will see what they have to do, but I think it is just the success of Flex. If you are a decent tank, there is no reason to be in LFR now. Flex does the same thing and you are grouped with people who are socially accountable, which makes all the difference. Tanking LFR is easy, but it is painfully slow. I did a Immerseus recently and it felt like it took a year to kill him. There was no chance of wiping, and nobody was dying.. but phases were just taking forever... I dropped group and said never again. My top raiding will be Flex mode, but I can tank all the bosses already, so getting an upgrade in LFR doesn´t feel that important to me, not enough to deal with how long it takes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should be easy enough to distinguish normal vs heroic as you gain Ahead of the curve on normal and Cutting Edge on heroic, though don't think there is anything to separate LFR/Flex as both will just gain Downfall afaik.</div></div><hr />

The vast majority of normal mode and even flex raiders have not cleared SoO. A bunch of progression oriented guilds that do heroic modes later on have also not fully cleared normal. First you complain about players jumping the gun and misinterpreting the SoO numbers and yet you do it yourself.</div></div><hr />

Tanks usually have more responsibility and less room for error than healers, which again have more responsibility and less room for error than dds. But I wouldn't say they are harder to play. Just because errors have harsher consequences doesn't mean that errors are also easier to make.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they sampled 2.5 million players (in the west) and 75% of them completed..say Mogushan Vaults, there you have your 1.8 million ppl that raid and this number is higher than raiding participation even in ICC with weekly quests and a 30% buff was. These 1.8 million are everyone from heroic to LFR<br />
<br />
The &quot;real raiders&quot; are the 50 000 ppl that are 14/14 normal according to wowprogress or possibly including flex the percentage that is shown on the graph (5%?). Wing 4 isn't even open on LFR, right?<br />
<br />
http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3461-SoO-Raid-Schedule-Cataclysm-now-part-of-Battle-Chest-Flex-Mechanics-DLC-411 - right! Flex wing 4 opened last week, LFR opens this.<br />
<br />
So..not sure what you mean where all the raiders are? The first raids have been available for months and months, all content is not yet availabale to all difficulties.<br />
<br />

Well I better get used to off hand remarks like your, naturally I cannot. I like to call you a baddy with the same rights if you haven't finished 14/14 HM. <br />
Then again, it is ignoring that only 2.5 million raiding people were sampled apparently and this is a completion rate. Millions of others DO NOT CARE about raids<br />
<br />
Lastly: LFR cannot yet access wing 4 of SoO<br />

Thus is the danger of statistics.<br />

Yes, that is fair, so tell them. But remember: You are not the center of the game or the universe. What if your reason was &quot;My wife had a baby&quot;? How would we balance the game around that info?<br />
<br />
And the devs are clever enough (certainly more than players) to know that even around THEM the universe does not revolve. What shitstorm would happen if they went &quot;We play the game, we think it is fine&quot;. Ofc they play the game. Still...feedback and data from 100 000 players is better than from 10...or just from you.<br />

I don't need loot there, but did some for the satchel - then it didn't drop. So I raised a ticket and basically got told &quot;yeah we know it's a bug, if that's the only reason you do LFR right now we suggest you don't, you're not getting the satchel awarded after the fact&quot;<br />
<br />
So, that being my *only* reason to ever do LFR, I did as the GM suggested and stopped doing it.<br />
<br />
And yes, it is also frustrating that people like me demand PG, achievements, tactics and 550+ ilevel for Flex and so folks can't get in(and I kick people who can't show they know tactics) but honestly I am finding LFR level people trying to do Flex, who lie about knowing the tactics and wipe us repeatedly, especially using oQueue. At least with those things I stand a chance of them having looked at the tactics and having a clue. I get a ton of abuse for it, but all I am asking is 15 minutes spent reading a site and looking at a video. <br />
<br />
If LFR actually starts offering a decent reward for people like me, we might come back and tank or heal it, but meanwhile the reason so many of us won't do LFR is down to *LFR players* not down to Blizz. It's just that Blizz aren't rewarding us for taking the pile of crap that comes with putting up with those players</div></div><hr />

I came every week prepared and ready to down him so after that happened without the raid leader letting us know I left the guild.

I would like to get more of my friends into the guild and raid but most of my friends are on at different times and have RL stuff and don't have time to raid.

<br />
Cataclysm I mained my Blood DK and I loved everything about it. I could compete in PvP in both arenas and BG's doing what I wanted to do (Tanking). I loved running dungeons and raids because it was fun rather than purely loot driven. <br />
<br />
But taking vengeance out of PvP (It definitely needed adjusting, not scrapping), the changes to tanks in PvP in regards to flag carrying, queueing as a tank rather than just queueing as a player, vengeance getting nerfed every other patch. They have taken away so many times and rarely give anything back. <br />
<br />
The drop in 5.4 is from the mechanics of SoO LFR. Its just frustrating to play through and coordinate. I'm not saying take them out so we can ignore them, i'm saying tone them down so that if a few guys get it wrong once or twice, its not a complete wipe for everyone.<br />

If you want to know why there is less tanks. Please tank a lfr and you will have your answers.<br />
If that was the only issue, it would likely be a gradual decline not a sudden drop at 5.4. That implies it's flex (or a bug). *<br />
<br />
The better players have flex on top of normal and maybe heroic now. As a result the quality of lfr-players did drop. This in addition to some pretty hard lfr mechanics(stop-damage+very crucial waves of adds) results in many wipes. Why should tanks that always have an instant invite go lfr if they can get better loot at flex with less wipes...while the mechanic pretty much stays the same for the tanks? And not to forget: The tanks are the princess of WoW...for many expansions already they got instant invites and jump ship whenever something isn't working instantly. In lfr we got 2 tanks...5 or so healers...and the rest is dd's....still I think I see way more healers and tanks leave than dd. That shows the attitude of many, many tanks...(how about some &quot;can't join another flex or lfr untill group finished and 30 minutes penalty on top of that&quot;? That would make them think twice).</div></div><hr />

Another thing to consider is that these data don't show the number of players that completed each raid. It shows the number of characters that completed it.

Basically you're right. I came back for 5.4 and I'm doing what I did in 4.3 except this time instead of being 19 ilvls behind normal raid after &quot;catch-up&quot; mechanics, you're basically 50ish ilvls behind and the only way to get back into the 25 range is to run LFR or move to Flex.<br />

Now after Blizzcon might get some players back, myself included. A long break don't hurt at all on LFR level content patches. Then again I did do first and second wing before my sub ranout.<br />
<br />
the release schedule was the same as always.. LFR is always released in stages months later</div></div><hr />

Can this be broken off into its own section?<br />
Also why the bias against people not in guilds?</div></div><hr />

It is just harder for me to come across them. I don't constantly check auctions for new characters we haven't seen yet, only a few times a week, so we will only discover them if they have an auction up while I am checking.</div></div><hr />

I only bothered before to catch up in certain slots or for the legendary quest while my guild was still working on normal's. <br />
<br />
Now, im allready at 550ilvl, and all of my gear from TOT was allready upgraded. the LFR loot is just not enough of an upgrade for me to want run SoO an extra time while dealing with some really horrible people at the same time. I could use the valor (i happened to get a glut of gear the last 2 weeks, and haven't upgraded it all yet), but the valor reward amounts simply are not enough for me to bother with the time investment over h scenarios or daily heroic which i can pretty much carry any amount of bad in and be done in about 10 mins. <br />
<br />
Flex can fill in the slots better than LFR, can be run with a small group of players who are organized and is more engaging. My guild is also 7/14 normal now, further reducing the amount of slots LFR would benefit us compared to gear we are getting on raid nights.<br />
<br />
TLDR: the reward structure is bad for those who arnt strictly raiding LFR</div></div><hr />

Blizzard keeps trying to force people to go against their actual wills. That is something that takes years of practice. There are plenty of people that play MMORPGs simply because they are never ending video games. These people really do not desire to be social at all, and Blizzard keeps wanting them to be more social. The people that want to be more social are already in guilds and are already in raiding guilds if that is what they desire to do. There is definitely two separate groups of gamers in WoW. Those that do not desire to have social ties are not suddenly going to get them. <br />
<br />
Blizzard feels that these people are more likely to leave the game because they lack these social ties. That is far from the truth. The truth is that these people are more likely to leave the game because Blizzard continuously treats them like second class citizens, and getting a piece of gear with &quot;Raid Finder&quot; attached simply because this group does not want to form social connections (more like social ass kissing) that is needed in order to get &quot;Heroic&quot; gear is simply something that this group simply does not want to do.</div></div><hr />

Then you could compare apples to apples.<br />
<br />
SoO may be low, but were previousl raid wings equally low after the same amount of time?</div></div><hr />

We don't track Asia, as the API is slow and buggy for those countries. I might be able to break it down for US/EU though!</div></div><hr />

It's like GC has never even actually tried LFR. <br />
In one SoO LFR, there was this Hunter doing 18K... and after every wipe where Nazgrim hit the Enrage mark, he would proceed to order around and tell people how the fight goes. He wasn't wrong, which indicates that this was his alt and he had done the fight properly before... which means it IS just low DPS or not knowing how to play that alt class, rather than not understanding the raid mechanics. Or simply not giving a hoot, a lot of people just lazily coast on through LFR to be carried, which GC should also actually acknowledge and address.<br />
<br />
I also like Pacster's solution for tanks who bail on LFR: &quot;How about some &quot;can't join another flex or lfr until group finished and 30 minutes penalty on top of that&quot;? That would make them think twice.&quot;<br />

In my opion its just a matter of the number of ppl over gearing things. I have friends that raid msv because they simply dont have the raiding skill to do current stuff. I have many friends that went back and did the old raids they never did once they over geared it. I dont think its because of deliclining raiding. I think as time goes by more people have time to go back and do the older stuff. <br />
That's really interesting to see that steady decline in raiders. I wonder if they quit, are leveling alts, or are focusing more on PvP.</div></div><hr />

The percentage of the different tank (can be done with heal or dps in another query) specs who have gold medal in proving grounds. It would show the average percentage of the tank classes. And i would like another one, what is done only to that ppl who have already gold proving grounds - the percentage of completion of the endless wave achievement. It would show if how much % of druids\DK\warrior\monk can get endless waves achievement from the guys who have already gold (so using proving grounds). I wish to know if there is any class who statistically better in the endless wave than the others.<br />
<br />
The thing behind is, i got gold but cant improve in the endless, and i am curious its cos i am noob or its cos my class is not optimal. Plus would be nice to see the real tank (heal, dps) percentage to see which is the popular classes.<br />
<br />
thank you</div></div><hr />

We can't do anything with gold, as the achievement shows up for every character. Endless is possible though.</div></div><hr />

Oh, you right, i didnt think to this. As i see, the endless achievement show for every character too. :(</div></div><hr />

Every character has an individual Endless score in their statistics that we can use.</div></div><hr />
