Subtlety Rogue Hotfixes 4/29<br />
The following hotfixes are scheduled to be live this week.<br />
<br />
Shadowstrike no longer deals reduced damage in PvP (was a 10% reduction).<br />
Eviscerate no longer deals reduced damage in PvP (was a 15% reduction).<br />
Mastery: Executioner is now reduced by 20% in PvP (was 33%).<br />
<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: We’ve been keeping an eye on Subtlety’s damage during Season 2 and have identified a few prior PvP reductions that we’re going to relax to help with its overall damage throughput. With this improvement to Eviscerate combined with the existing PvP-only reduction to Night’s Vengeance (Azerite Trait) and the removal of Shuriken Combo we feel Subtlety’s potential Eviscerate damage will be brought into an acceptable range for PvP combat. Subtlety will continue to keep its PvP-only reductions to their stackable cooldown strength, but we also felt that it was necessary to increase throughput outside of those windows.<br />

Is there really a cap for the Heart of Azeroth?<br />
Or it's a &quot;seasonal cap&quot; preventing you from achieving more lvl than intended during the current season?<br />
<br />
Whatever, what's the, current or not, cap?</div></div><hr />

when you do things that rewards artifact power it still says you gained the power, but progress line is at 0.</div></div><hr />

It is known if it's only untill 8.2 or permanent ( finally no more grind, or just a pause from the grind )?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zequill</div><div class="date">2019-04-30, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The &quot;grind&quot; (I can't believe people actively seek Artifact Power, you get more then enough just doing normal stuff) is back in 8.2, this time to unlock a Legion like traits pattern on the neck itself, no more unlock past level 50 on Azerite pieces.</div></div><hr />
