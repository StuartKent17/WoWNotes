You really think boosting base damage is a massive dps boost? I think it goes from 480 to 744 damage (direct hit) and dot's base damage is low anyway (so no big difference there either).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would be funny to see those huge crits at 80, but the thing you're forgetting is that they are rebalancing basically EVERYTHING and the way everything works. I'm sure that the numbers will be balanced and overall a Destro lock will do the same damage as everyone else. Also, not sure if you looked over it or not, but its a bump to BASE damage, not AS huge of a deal (although by today's standards, yeah, pretty big).<br />
<br />
Remember when wrath was about to hit and paladins got to 'double dip' ap into spellpower for the first time and everyone was like WTF IS THIS? There was a short time where all you saw was retadins lol... it'll pass even if it is big.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes i know that, but its broken, numpty<br />
the warriors threat when multitanking on the ptr is almost non existant, singletargets is no probs<br />
paladins have simmilar issues with RF, we just dont gain enough threat to keep up with the large amount of agro the dps do.<br />
even a healers have a higher threat gain than the tanks...</div></div><hr />

I hate that it could be used as a clue to where a non tank may have to &quot;tank&quot; a boss again.

Yeah no. They won't patch it before giving the rewards for Season 8 and letting people spend their Arena Points before the conversion. So I would say 2 weeks: October 26th, right after Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here goes my first post,<br />
<br />
Mind Spike is a lead into Mind blast. It currently is a big part of my rotation/priority in beta. I mindspike twice(to reduce MB cast time to 0) and immediately hit Mindblast. If I don't have to refresh my dots at this time, I mindflay in between. It is now a timing issue of how much time do you have to get in two Mindspikes before your mindblast comes off cooldown. <br />
<br />
Other than that, SW: Death should always be on cd for mana regen reasons.<br />
<br />
If I'm not careful, I can easily top a tank in aggro with the burst I get during a MS, MS, MB, SW:Death combo. I honestly don't think it needs the threat increase. Maybe people are just spamming it regardless of other CD's and noticing a dps increase? I haven't looked into it. but I'm pretty sure blizzard wants the 2 MS's, and 1 MB combo to only occur a bit before MB is off cool down.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents.<br />

Well considering Patch 3.0.2 was released on October 14 2008, the same day that Arena Season 4 finished, I'm not really seeing the problem. Arena points are automatically converted into Conquest Points anyway, and there's no hardcap until Patch 4.0.3 is released, so there's no reason why Patch 4.0.1 can't be released on the 12th of October 2010 alongside the end of Season 8.</div></div><hr />

Half-right. Yes what you stated is right. However, a few weeks later, we get the pre-event, which then kicks in the new 1-60 world at it's climax, and THAT is when the new race/class combos open up.<br />
<br />
Goblin/Worgen req a Cata Account, same with 80-85 zones.<br />
Guild Achieve/XP/Rep is disabled until Cata goes live.<br />
Flying in Azeroth and Archaeology are questionable. Blizz said they aren't sure on Archaeology yet. I'd like it before-hand, and flight would make it easier, too.<br />
<br />
When Cataclysm comes out, I doubt you will have anything to install. Just upgrade your account, and play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4.0.1 won't include the new Race/Class combinations. That's in 4.0.3, alongside the new zones, etc. Azeroth flying, the new races, Archaeology, Guild Leveling and the 80-85 zones are Cataclysm-only. (Actually Guild Leveling might not be Cataclysm-only, but either way it will most likely stay disabled until the expansion is released.<br />
<br />
4.0.1 WILL introduce the new talent trees, pre-Cataclysm quests and events, Reforging, and the end of Season 8.<br />
<br />
<br />
if they release the patch on the 12th, am i allowed to assume Boub's Secret Source was wrong? and it won't be a december release?<br />
<br />
The patches are apparently on target for their respective release dates, but the expansion itself was likely delayed until late November. I doubt they would release Cataclysm after Thanksgiving Day, apparently games released after that day see reduced sales. That and Blizzard have never released a game or expansion after Thanksgiving, from memory. For once I actually doubt Boub's accuracy on this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this right or...?<br />
<br />
There will be two pre Cataclysm patches, unlike previous expansions. Check out this blue post:<br />

&quot;New race/class combinations and changes to the old world (including quests) should be patch 4.0.3. I know it's kind of confusing since we typically release one major patch right before the release of the next expansion. In this case, many of the systems changes will be added in 4.0.1, while a lot of content changes will be added in 4.0.3.<br />
<br />
The expansion will then provide players with access to the new races, new zones, level 85 cap, flight in Azeroth, Archaeology, etc. &quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having fun and feeling like you are contributing is what's important, regardless of whether it's bosses or trash.<br />
<br />
If Shadow Priests are feeling encumbered by their ramp up time on mobs that are dying quickly then they are not having fun. It's not a concept that's very hard to understand and it's not about DPS.<br />
<br />
I also see the increased threat on Mind Spike as something that should not be necessary. If it is currently doing so much damage that it's a big part of the normal spell rotation used on bosses then shouldn't there be some other method of limiting its use in that context other than increases the threat it generates?</div></div><hr />

Nop. They say need 1 week to give titles so 4.0.1 should come after that becuase I 4.0.1 will not change azeroth but will change all badges to money and justice points and arena points to new honor points. Maybe a change like this can mess up data and is better they give away the tittles, etc before anything change to the systeam. 4.0.3 Should come 3/4 week after 4.0.1 so probably 4.0.1 come late in october, .4.0.3 in november and a few week after, december come the expansion. This is my tip.</div></div><hr />

Actually just copied my mage onto the latest ptr build and arena points are definitely getting changed to the new honor points and so far they took out all the current pvp vendors.

Which is because the season is over, there's always an arena point reset after the end of the season. Don't see how they can't hand out titles etc after 4.0.1 rolls around - as far as I know, the frostwyrms aren't handed out to the people who have the most arena points! x)</div></div><hr />

Maybe coz you don't have to gear up at bg first like in past days. Now Arenas and bg's have analogical rewards and ppl will be able to play and gear up in the one they like.<br />
Or maybe coz we already have somekind of currency converted from old ones to buy starting gear and go pew-pew.<br />
However, maybe Blizz want's to try something new.<br />

That was after the Christmas Holidays. Games don't sell so well between Thanksgiving Day and New Years Day. Which is why most games are released around October-November or January-February, to take advantage of the pre and post Christmas shopping rushes.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I particularly buy this argument. Someone who shopping for someone else for Christmas or whatever might see a certain video game on a big display (like on release) and grab it on a lark, but that has to be a somewhat small percentage. It's an expansion after all. I can't think of anyone I know that plays WoW that wouldn't run out and buy Cata because it wasn't on sale at the right time of the year. Whenever it comes out they're ALL going to get it.</div></div><hr />

That might be because they removed all the passive -x threat talents. So you have dps doing tons of damage, and way more threat than they used to, while you as a tank are doing less. This is at least true with warriors and paladins. Our threat generation..blah why rehash something that is already know. The blues even posted about it, but yeah. <br />

<br />
Personally I feel that perhaps your itemization is off. I found that the largest portion of my DPS came from white hits. It was consistantly about 35%. I made sure I was hit capped, and I mean 24% with precision hit capped. Then, all other reforging went to Haste. In my red slots I have Bold Card's (+20 STR), Yellow slots are Fierce Ametrines (+10 STR / +10 HST) and my blue slots are Etched Ametrines (+10 STR / +10 HIT). It is important to note that they are known as Etched Ametrines on live however, on the PTR HIT was converted to a blue gem and therefore the name has changed on the PTR. 2 of my blue slots are straight HIT just so I could get that last bit for the cap. I managed to pull 7k consistantly on the dummy. On live I'm honestly only able to manage around 5.5k to 6k on the test dummies. for me 6k on a dummy translates to 13k in ICC with the full 30% buff. I'm hoping that I see the same correlation when the new patch drops.<br />
<br />
Try out the settup. The worst that happens is you decide I'm an idiot and do something different. After all... It is only the PTR. :P</div></div><hr />

Searing pain does far less aggro than Incinerate, simply because it doesn't do any damage ;) Priests are in a completely different situation with their mindspike...<br />

With all the major changes in gear itemization, gemming and enchanting I think it'd be a bad idea to let people spend money on gear right before 4.0.1 ships. I'm going to throw my money on 4.0.1 coming out the same day season 8 ends.</div></div><hr />

Mind Spike is a lead into Mind blast. It currently is a big part of my rotation/priority in beta. I mindspike twice(to reduce MB cast time to 0) and immediately hit Mindblast. If I don't have to refresh my dots at this time, I mindflay in between. It is now a timing issue of how much time do you have to get in two Mindspikes before your mindblast comes off cooldown. <br />
<br />
Other than that, SW: Death should always be on cd for mana regen reasons.<br />
<br />
If I'm not careful, I can easily top a tank in aggro with the burst I get during a MS, MS, MB, SW:Death combo. I honestly don't think it needs the threat increase. Maybe people are just spamming it regardless of other CD's and noticing a dps increase? I haven't looked into it. but I'm pretty sure blizzard wants the 2 MS's, and 1 MB combo to only occur a bit before MB is off cool down.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents.<br />

They're trying to keep it out of main rotations while not messing with its usefulness in PvP. Adding more threat to it hardly seems like the answer to that, but meh. Baby steps.<br />

Regardless of its effect on final balance, it makes me grumble that Warlocks are getting the real Heroic Leap and warriors aren't.</div></div><hr />

That's in 4.0.3, alongside the new zones, etc. Azeroth flying, the new races, Archaeology, Guild Leveling and the 80-85 zones are Cataclysm-only. (Actually Guild Leveling might not be Cataclysm-only, but either way it will most likely stay disabled until the expansion is released.<br />
<br />
4.0.1 WILL introduce the new talent trees, pre-Cataclysm quests and events, Reforging, and the end of Season 8.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The patches are apparently on target for their respective release dates, but the expansion itself was likely delayed until late November. I doubt they would release Cataclysm after Thanksgiving Day, apparently games released after that day see reduced sales. That and Blizzard have never released a game or expansion after Thanksgiving, from memory. For once I actually doubt Boub's accuracy on this one.<br />
<br />
I don't know about the reduced sales thing. After all, if it came out on December 7th or 14th like some people think it would be hitting just in time for the tons of people, including anyone that is under 18, to be buying it up like candy for christmas gifts</div></div><hr />
