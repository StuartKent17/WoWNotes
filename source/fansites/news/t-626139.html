The layout of the original post has been slightly changed to make it more readable<br />
We have talked about making some of these changes and wanted to provide more details. You should be able to try these out yourselves on the PTR before they go live.<br />
<br />
Our reason for most of these changes should be obvious, but some common themes are:<br />
Making tanking still rely on cooldowns, but rely on them a little less.<br />
Make Blood a more attractive spec, and particularly for tanking.<br />
Chill out some of the defensive capabilities all DKs have in PvP.<br />
Avoid having to use Death and Decay as an out-of-combat runic power generator.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
General<br />
All multi-rune abilities generate 15 runic power.<br />
New runeforge rune -- Rune of the Stoneskin Gargoyle (two-handed only) now grants 25 Defense and 2% Stamina.<br />
Many death knight glyphs have been changed. In many cases the negative consequences were removed.<br />
New death knight sigils are now available, primarily from vendors, including a tanking-oriented sigil. <br />
<br />
Blood<br />
Rune Strike (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=56815) -- damage decreased from 200% to 150% but threat increased to 150% from 100%.<br />
The healing of Blood Aura (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50371), Blood Presence (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48266) and Death Pact (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48743) has been doubled.<br />
Heart Strike (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55262) – we overhauled this ability. It no longer has a haste debuff but will now be able to strike two targets like a cleave. It still hits for more than Blood Strike, but you can still use Blood Strike if e.g. you don’t want to break CC.<br />
Bloody Strikes (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49395) – the bonus damage from Pestilence has been moved here to help Blood AE slightly.<br />
Vampiric Blood (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55233) -- in addition to its current effects, also adds 20% health temporarily.<br />
Will of the Necropolis (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50150) -- now reduces the damage of any attack that takes the DK below 35% health by 5 /10/15% instead of boosting armor when wounded,<br />
Dancing Rune Weapon (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49028) – cost reduced from 60 to 40 runic power.<br />
<br />
Frost<br />
Icebound Fortitude (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48792) – now reduces damage by 20% instead of 50%. The amount of damage reduced increases with bonus Defense (to about 35% for 540 Defense, but it can go higher). The stun immunity is intended to be its primary role in PvP.<br />
Frost Presence (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48263) -- bonus armor increased from 60 to 80% and magic damage reduction increased from 5 to 15%. We wanted to reduce the effectiveness of cooldowns but bring up base mitigation to reduce damage spikiness.<br />
Horn of Winter (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=57623) -- now has no cost and grants 10 runic power in addition to its stat buff, but has a 30 sec cooldown.<br />
Hungering Cold (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49203) – cost reduced from 60 to 40 runic power.<br />
<br />
Unholy<br />
Anti-Magic Shell (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48707) -- cooldown lowered to 45 sec from 60 sec.<br />
Bone Shield (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49222) -- mitigation reduced from 40% to 20%.<br />
Corpse Explosion (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=51328) -- damage increased substantially, added 5 sec cooldown, and changed cost to 40 runic power.<br />
Night of the Dead (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55623) -- now grants 40/70% passive area spell avoidance to your pet in addition to its current effects.<br />
Outbreak (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55237) – this talent no longer receive bonus damage from Pestilence. The bonus from Plague Strike and Blood Boil has been increased slightly.<br />
Pestilence (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=51429) -- no longer has a 10 sec cooldown.<br />
Raise Dead (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=46584) -- now split into two spells: Raise Dead now raises a ghoul or pet ghoul (if talented). Raise Ally now raises a fallen party member (at no reagent cost).<br />
Shadow of Death (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49157) -- duration reduced from 45 seconds to 25 seconds.<br />
Unholy Blight (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=51379) – cost reduced from 60 to 40 runic power.<br />
<br />

Now i have a reason to go blood... i missed those little wurms (especially Larry and Jim-Bob) from the old OMG NERF DK!!!!!! beta days.<br />
Also... huzzah Corpse Explosion!<br />
<br />
Only one little minor tiny little minor minor tiff. First enchant(ish thing) that scales with gear? And no, I don't include the old armor pen system and executioner. QQ gimme back my 5% tauren racial lulz. On the plus side i can finally use a different rune ~~</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously aside from that IBF nerf which bugs me for pvp the rest seems awesome.<br />
More Incentive to go Blood can only be good as everyone and their mother is Unholy atm. And of course Bone Shield nerfs sucks hairy balls... <br />
<br />
Though is it me or they totally forgot that frost existed too ? It only got nerfed more then others as IBF is 18 second duration for Frost DK's ... That's kinda lame since no one is frost, frost dps sucks, frost tanking is less and less popular too. I guess the only ''reason'' to go frost tanking now is because Bone Shield got nerf'ed, but that doesn't give anything to Frost. Weird imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the point of this new change?<br />
<br />
<br />
It raises them as a ghoul. The point is that some specs (*cough* unholy) felt it more advantageous to rez their own pet, assuming it will stay alive for longer than 45 seconds than to rez another player who will have limited use over a short period of time.<br />
This change removes that little problema.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the point of this new change?<br />
<br />
<br />
Raise 45 seconds as a ghoul. The point ? well... now it's gonna be usefull for something instead of being a pathetic feature. <br />
<br />
Before that you had the choice between you had to sacrifice your ghoul to raise a player that way which was beyond pointless... Now you can have both, thus it works as a short-timed dps oriented battle res.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If 540 defense gives you a ~35% damage reduction (up from 20%), then you're getting about 15% mitigation for 140 defense. This boils down to about 0.1% mitigation per defense. Defense enchants run in the 20ish rating range, meaning dropping a defense enchant means you lose around 0.3% damage reduction on a CD with ~15% uptime. That means a hit that would normally do 6500 damage w/ IBF up will now do 30 less damage. I really doubt IBF will be good reason to stack defense past 540.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the point of this new change?<br />
<br />
there were many times when I wanted to raise a ghoul after a wipe but I &quot;rezzed&quot; my party member instead who died very close to the boss. After that we wiped again &gt;.&lt; It chooses automatically the closiest humanoid or an ally corpse. So that's a necessary change.</div></div><hr />

Bone shield lost it usefullness (even tho i dont use it much in lvling XD) they least should have increased the damage bonus<br />
not too big changes on my beloved unholy which i see as good thing<br />

1) IBF was necessary.... melee classes might as well have just turned around and bent over when facing an Unholy DK with BS and IBF up. Trust me, i play both sides of the coin. Being OP is fun, but playing a T7 MS war who can barely dent a green/blue DK is rather sad.<br />
<br />
2) Already given, in two different flavours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to trust Blizzard that the IBF nerf tradeoff with the Frost Presence buff will result in not much change in my tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
At least they didn't touch our Unbreakable Armor.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see the changes they have in mind for the glyphs. Hopefully they remove the damage nerf aspect of the Icy Touch glyph.<br />
<br />
Unholy and Blood do better DPS, but I've surprisingly find myself liking Frost.</div></div><hr />

Healers hate hate hate hate damage spikes. For those of you that were around when Karazhan was new and exciting (and difficult), remember Prince's phase two crazy ass frenzy? Remember how healers hated that? The changes smooth out Frost's mitigation, making it fit a straight line more than a sine curve (of frustration and death).</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but I didn't know Frost took spikier damage than Unholy. From everything I've read, Unbreakable Armor is superior to Bone Shield until your gear is good enough to keep the Bone Shield up for near its full duration. I may be mistaken, though. So maybe I could consider it a buff that Unbreakable Armor was left alone! :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fugazi</div><div class="date">2008-12-10, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IBF and BS nerfs hurts and I am speaking from DPS PvE point of view. On the other side we can use AMS more often and most &quot;bad&quot; things are magic so...<br />
<br />
Now the big things are:<br />
- Corpse Explosion is worth taking now! Especially 50/0/21 spec will enjoy this, awesome.<br />
- Night of the Dead and 70% anti-aoe for Ghoul - FINALLY, that sucker loves to die everywhere and I cannot express how much that was needed.<br />
<br />
I am just curious that Unholy aoe got buffed even more, UB and CE changes were needed but it just feels strange. I expected more Blood aoe buffs but well HS aoe buff seems huge yet 3 targets would work better I think.<br />
<br />
Anyhow from my pov (dps + tanking heroics in dps spec) I am looking forward to all those changes. Granted there are some nerfs but also many great buffs, oh and we will get some sigils finally oh my god!</div></div><hr />

Well it doesn't persay. But hey, now you can get all the benefits of being a DK tank without BS being a must have, and saving the IBF for spikes. And if that's not a buff idk what is.</div></div><hr />

Don't tell me that. I'm finally almost out of the Iron Ore stage of mining and Blacksmithing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eldadelin</div><div class="date">2008-12-10, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome. Love the changes, mainly for blood. A little :'( about removing the haste factor from heart strike, as I REALLY wanted to test that in arena ( If it works like I believed, gear haste/winfury/blood lust where all negated) if not, then turning it into a 'cleave' is awesome, now not only do I have something more to help clear trash, a boss like maxxena won't make me change my rotation to much to help down the adds (they go down quick, I just hated not being able to help much). Rune strike 'nerf' is nothing big for dps/pvp, &lt;3 it for tanking. <br />
<br />
Now, frost presence buff seems great, but I don't think it makes up for the IBF nerf. 20% From 50% is just to great a number imo. OP? Not very. I understand the 'stun' part was meant for pvp, but they should have left it at 35% At the very least, I tresured this as an ohshit button vs. Melle (bg's aren't that serious, but this let me get off the final hit I needed to kill whatever before I died.) the CE change is GREAT. I'm considering picking it up for an unholy spec I'm going to try soon. <br />
<br />
BA nerf kind of hurt, again, the % Change was to big, FP change will not make up for that. The blood buffs overall (Dps) Make me very happy, and I might even be able to do something with blood ' tanking ' once PTR is up and I get a chance to test it.</div></div><hr />

Bone Shield change is kind of weird. As DPS, I use it as a nice buffer if I pull agro or get adds on me.<br />
<br />
Corpse Explosion is another runic dump to use! yay.<br />
<br />
Increase survivability for pets in AoE is great. There are plenty of groups of trash/bosses that I don't even bother spawning my pet for because of the AoE.<br />
<br />
I wonder if they'll put some limits on Raise Ally. like a separate cooldown? Only one allowed? No reagent for it is going to be sweet.<br />
<br />
Can't wait to jump on PTR and test this out.</div></div><hr />

The fact that I can be lazy and stand in shit on bosses while barely taking a tickle of damage because I have bone shield up is enough reason to nerf it you ignorant sod. Don't even get started on PvP.<br />

Awesome changes. Nerfs what needs to be nerfed, fixes what needs to be fixed.<br />

Well I am glad all of you PVErs are happy because they DESTROYED us in PVP. Bone armor GONE, IBF GONE, survivability GONE. I think that reducing IBF was needed but 35% period, not just for tanks.

<br />
25 Def Skill = 1% Parry + 1% Dodge + 1% Chance of being Missed ( thanks to the 0.04 you get for each of these for each def skill ).<br />
<br />
So all you do converting 1% parry into a whooping 25 def skill and 2% stam You also swap 2% dodge for some minor avoidances compaired to parry but thats a price i am totaly fine to pay so i can get rid of def trinkets and can go more avoidance or stam based. Still, for end game and after uncritability isn't hard to achieve i see this runeforging going into history for some players, it will always be acttractive thanks to its scaling posibilty (2% stam ) and that we can use it in the next expansion again.<br />
<br />
Altough i am sure i will keep using this new neat baby basicly so I can have some diversity in gear and trinkets mainly. The stam makes it only more attractive.</div></div><hr />

- all I see is that blood DPS gets nerfed...&quot;for better tanking, ofc&quot;<br />
- Frost gets sum bump up the arse, but that is not &quot;so&quot; worse...<br />
- Unholy gets buffed... again.<br />

Show me where Blood's dps went down?* They made none of our skills weaker, and now Heart Strike hits TWO targets, and still does the same damage it does now.<br />
<br />
RUNESTRIKE, if that is what you are talking about, is actually FROST. It's even in the FROST TAB in your spell book. It should be listed under the frost changes of the list, not blood.</div></div><hr />

On the whole though they needed to balance the specs for DKs, whether this will do it or not we'll have to wait and see. We're already doing pretty well as a class so it'd be pretty silly to go begging for more buffs where they really arent that needed.<br />

I'm sitting at 15k armor out of frost presence<br />
<br />
I go into frost presence currently and go up to 24k<br />
<br />
If i go into the 80% frost presence post patch, i go up to 27K armor<br />
<br />
The difference from 21k to 24k is about 3% physical midigation. meaning 24-27k is going to be 1.5-2%<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So let me get this straight. I'm trading 18% midigation on pretty much everything (lets face it, BS is almost never down once you have high evasion) in exchange for 2% midigation &quot;all the time&quot; (even though BS is up almost all the time anyway)<br />
<br />
And you're all raving about these changes?.... I guess all of you are blood spec, huh? =\</div></div><hr />

In blue crafted gear with the chest enchant and Dabiri's enigma I was at 540 defense the moment I dinged 80. I think the problem is just most DKs were too lazy to get the stuff made.<br />
<br />
As for the changes, in general they seem pretty nice though Bone Armor does seem a little lackluster now. A 20% reduction just doesn't feel like its going to save your ass from a damage spike. Though with 20% more armor and much better spell damage reduction it will more than make up for it I think. Making it scale a little with defense probably wouldn't hurt. They could at least remove the rune cost from it now I think.<br />
<br />
In fact, I think they missed the point a little on DK tanking abilities. The reason neither Bone Armor nor Unbreakable Armor can be used reactively is because you will never have the rune available when the damage spike comes. It is hard to use either of these as a panic button when you have to wait 10 seconds for the rune to light up. Plus, by making the reduction offered by the abilities less spectacular it pushes them into being used even moreso as passive reduction than they are at present, basically doing the exact opposite of the intended effect.<br />
<br />
In PvP the changes are a very distinct nerf. Yeah, DKs were relatively strong against melee (though some people who think ganking people while they quest is PvP really are overstating that strength). The problem is that the DK is the easiest class to kite for any half competent ranged DPS. Having a 35 (or 25) second cooldown on our only closing ability means that pretty much every ranged class can use their &quot;get out of melee&quot; ability more often than DKs can use their &quot;get into melee&quot; ability. Our snares are all dispellable with no way to increase chance to resist dispel on them. The damage reduction seemed to be how DKs were supposed to deal with kiters, they just have to suck up the damage for the 25 seconds until you have a chance to close again, now the only way to do that is to go to a presence where you lose your increased movement speed, a catch 22.<br />
<br />
With these changes there is pretty much no way a DK can last 25 seconds to close distance again against any half competent ranged DPS which will make them a free HK for most of the classes in the game not to mention gutting them as an arena class. I expect DKs will struggle in arena though, single target DPS, no CC, a very long cooldown on the only range closing ability (though the most fun one it has to be said), dispellable snares and a dispellable combat system. Being good at shutting down holy paladins is hardly a viable niche. Melee burst DPS is a role much better done by both warriors and rogues. <br />
<br />
On the other hand its still way too soon to judge I guess. What is good to see is that Blizzard are being quick to fix class issues so if it does show as a problem hopefully it will get sorted out then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, going from 21k ~60% mitigation to 24k ~63% mitigation means that instead of taking 40% of damage you will now take 37% of damage. So you will be taking 37 / 40 = 92.5% of the melee damage you were taking before so it will give you about a 7.5% reduced physical damage.</div></div><hr />

Right, but the problem is, when you upgrade to epics that have less def rating than the craftable blues, what happens to your defense?<br />
<br />
My DK tank set right now is half blue half epic, and I have 542 defense, but it sure is a dick trying to keep it that high, and I've dipped to 538-539 a few times since first hitting 540.</div></div><hr />

While I agree IBF and BS were incredibly overpowered, they didn't throw us a bone at all to stay competitive with frost. Time to go frost for Unbreakable Armor weeeee.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard should have considered other options rather than flat our nerfs to abilities. Surely there must be a way to change a spell so it does things differently depending on a PvP or PvE situation. For example, when zoned into an instance, IBF stays at 50%. <br />
<br />
Also, they need to give us a new 4-piece bonus for T7, since they just destroyed the usefulness of IBF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
An Unholy DK can now get a flat 20% spell damage reduction (24% if you use the spell damage rune) as well as full magic immunity for 10 seconds out of every 75 if you glyph your anti-magic shell making them arguably the best magic damage tank in the game. For physical damage yeah a Frost tank is probably going to retain the advantage but it still means it is worth having one of each available. <br />
<br />
The 20% on bone armor does feel rather weak though. Starting at 30% and reducing by 5% per hit so you get 30, 25, 20, 15, (10 with glyph) damage reduced on successive attacks would probably be more useful. <br />
<br />
All changes however have to be taken in the context that you are getting a constant 20% increased armor and 10% reduced spell damage taken which is, quite possibly, the single biggest tanking stats buff any class has ever gotten.</div></div><hr />

ive got 1 piece of crafted tanking gear and no defence trinket with one t7 piece and the heroic badge tanking neck pice and im sat at a comfortable 545 defence if i were to go get the HoL trinket i could easily get 3/4 more pieces of t7 armour and gem them properly to keep max defence.<br />

Pull kill target behind a pillar to LoS them from heals? yes thanks. Worse you could daisy chain with 2 DKs to bring them automatically 50 yards or more out of range (and behind a pillar) which gives 3-4 DPS plenty of time.<br />
<br />
It is too soon to tell with some of these, but I think the nerfs to survivability were necessary. Coming from a previous warrior, currently the amount of damage avoidance the DKs can have while still putting out good dps just by being in a stance (frost presence) is sickening. warriors get their damage nerfed by being in defensive stance...<br />
<br />
Anyways. As a frost DK tank, I'm pleased with the changes. And contrary to what some have suggested I'll prolly push for 590 defense just to have 40% on IBF. the extra parry dodge and miss will also be welcome =D Although I'm sure rating wise it would be smarter to socket for straight out dodge/parry, but whatevs.</div></div><hr />

BS does still however increase damage by 2% but that's an expensive point if you're Unholy DPS considering the reduction in damage you'll take. But, if played correctly you'll be behind the target reducing that damage anyway. For solo questing however I've found BS to be quite a help.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if it's better to just keep UB spam'd now with the rune power cost reduction. Thoughts?</div></div><hr />
