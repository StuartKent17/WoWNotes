<br />
Nexus<br />
In the Borean Tundra (2nd starting zone with Howling Fjord) will be the Nexus. This is where you will find the blue dragons splitted between 3 instances :<br />
A level 70-71, 5 players instance (Ice Caverns).<br />
A level 80 instance that let you fight on big magical rings that float above the grounds (o_O)<br />
A rift in the sky where you will be able to fight Malygos with a 25 person raid. (Like Gruul or Onyxia, it will be a short raid) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dustwallow Marsh<br />
A new goblin town will be added to Dustwallow Marsh with new quests. <br />
<br />
Faster leveling<br />
In a future patch (before the expansion), levels 20 to 60 will have the experience required per-level reduced and quests will yield 30% more experience. <br />
<br />
Heroic Badges<br />
As long with the tons of new items added to the heroic badge vendor in 2.3, they're considering the possibility to add armor sets as heroic badges rewards. <br />
<br />
Utgarde Keep<br />
The first dungeon of WotLK will have two wings. The first one being Utgarde Keep, a level 70 instance for 5 players. The second one is Utgarde Pinnacle, this one will be level 80 for 5 players. Both instances will have heroic modes.<br />
<br />
Inscription profession<br />
They don't want a profession to just do spell improvements like +100 damage, instead they want it to be something that let you increase the radius of your frost nova, or increase the root timer of the spell, etc ...<br />
<br />
Hunters<br />
Hunters may get a &quot;woodworking&quot; profession in the future, to let them create arrows. (But it will be released much later, don't expect it for WotLK)<br />
They're trying to improve the desirability of hunters in arenas, one of the idea is to give them a mortal strike-like shot that reduces the healing effectiveness on the target.<br />

Oh no please not more Mortal Strike-like spells, one again instead of reworking the spell they give it to more :( Hopefully they implement something to ignore such spells as a healer for a short time or nerf the %</div></div><hr />

The WoW lore is going downhill imho! Who's next? Alexstrasza? Nozdormu? Oooooh, how about Ysera? Yeah, no more Emerald dream, sorry Druids, no more hibernation for you guys :P<br />
<br />
Seriously, personally, I think it's retarted killing off one of the 5 Dragons. The Titans bestowed powers upon them for a reason! Sure, Blizzard can do what they want with their Universe. I just feel that the characters and creatures in the Warcraft universe we've come to love, are being slaughtered one by one.....<br />

<br />
Alexstrasza and the red dragonflight will be HELPING us against Malygos due to the promise she made to Rhonin after the events of the Day of the Dragon novel.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not stated anywhere that we actually kill it, just that he's gone mad. He could very well come to his senses after a good beating.<br />
<br />
<br />
Malygos is sane again actually... and it seems he might not be able to remember a whole lot from when he was insane.<br />
<br />
This quote should explain everything i just said:<br />
<br />
<br />
The following afternoon during the WoW Lore Panel, Chris Metzen elaborated more on the now hostile Blues. Tyrygosa - having taken the Nether Dragons under her wing - has brought the ethereal dragons to Northrend. The exposure to their physiology has helped cure Malygos and the Blue Aspect's sanity is returning to him. Malygos, with clearer eyes, takes note of the large number of mortal spellcasters running around Azeroth, recklessly using arcane magic, and decides they will attract the Burning Legion to Azeroth again, as the Highborne once did (one of his last few memories before going mad). Thus he proceeds to declare war on all magic users. Dalaran travels to Northrend to combat the Blue Flight, and the Red Dragonflight - keeping Alexstrasza's promise to Rhonin after the events of Day of the Dragon - has stepped up to defend the mortals from their cousins' crusade against spellcasters.</div></div><hr />

Patch 2.3 I believe it is... could be patch 2.4 just as well though, depends on when they are done I suppose.</div></div><hr />

I actually haven't read any of those books except from the first book of the sunwell trilogy when blizz hosted it on their wow sites, the reason I found out about tyrygosa taking the netherdrakes to Malygos and all that was actually something I read on a forum somewhere. I can't remember where, I found the info again through google, but was unable to find a proper source for it.<br />

<br />
<br />
Most likely, yeah, but it's still unknown if Malygos does remember anything from when he was mad or not. As for Tyrygosa getting hold of some netherdrakes, there's a nifty little quest series in Netherstorm where you actually help her get those, so you basically helped Malygos regain his sanity :P<br />
That little quest series starts here (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=10270) from an ethereal.</div></div><hr />

Kewl, thanks, I will look into it :)<br />
<br />
As for The Sunwell Trilogy, try and get it! Really a great story! I couldn't wait to roll a Blood Elf after I read somewhere on the Internet, probably WoWwiki, about undead Dar'khan Drathir in Ghostlands! I like how they implemented that storyline into the Blood Elf lvl 10 -20 zone :)</div></div><hr />
