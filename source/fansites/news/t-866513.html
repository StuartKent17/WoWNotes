Blue Posts<br />
I guess we finally know why Ghostcrawler is gone from the forums: we can blame the europeans (but not me) and the whiners who don't take the time of reading posts when they come from a blue tracker. There, that's why the daily classes update are gone, but now we have super fast updates to patches hotfixes! <br />
Why Ghostcrawler stopped posting on official forums<br />
These forums have always been about players talking to players. We don't want to foster the expectation that it's going to get a blue response if someone tries hard enough (lol I'm replying to a thread calling for a blue). While GC added a lot to these forums (and I say 'these forums' because he only posted in the North America forums) we think we can reach more players, particularly those in other regions, more directly through the blogs, or concerted Q&amp;A's. Blogs also tend to be a better medium for getting the message out there loud and clear, but does have downsides that it removes the conversation that we know is appreciated quite a bit.<br />
<br />
While forum posts do lend themselves to that conversational approach, they actually have a lot of downsides to them from our perspective of attempting to get clear and clean information to the players. They aren't very visible is really the first and maybe biggest problem. You can liken forum posts and the information given in them to some of the displeasure surrounding how hotfixes are communicated. I may reply to a thread 20 times and in my #13 reply I say something really important regarding class balance. Who is going to see that? How quickly will that knowledge actually permeate? Will the message be kept clear? Will my clarification in post #17 that explains what people are misunderstanding in #13 be seen by everyone that read #13? People tend not to read past the first blue post in a thread, or skip around and don't read them all, so if you have a correction/addendum to the first post, or just expound upon a thought, it's generally lost on the majority of readers. Blue trackers can help with this, but we're generally not having to explain that &quot;post #13 wasn't the end of the thought and it's being taken out of context&quot; to people who just go to blue trackers. Forum posts also tend to be fairly quickly written by one of us without much in the way of peer-review, and anything written off-the-cuff like a reply to a thread can tend to be more precarious than a more substantive outlet that has an official process of review and correction before its posted (like the blogs). Much to the dismay of many forum goers I'm sure, there's just an infinitely smaller chance we'll say something stupid or mess up in a fully published blog post.<br />
<br />
As with anything we do, we never believe we're perfect. There's always room to improve. The blogs may not be the best outlet but we're continually working to improve upon the content we're delivering, and have some pretty exciting stuff planned. We're also working to make the comment system for the blogs a bit more like the forums so conversation can be held there more easily, as well. Of course you've no doubt see we're running a recurring global Ask the Devs Q&amp;A. It's one way where we're hoping to fill that gap of direct developer interaction that the blogs probably just can't hit. We think the Q&amp;A's are going to be extremely popular and fill a big part of what made GC's interactions on here so useful. And we’re going to continue collecting feedback and posting when appropriate, but we'll also be trying to come up with additional ways to facilitate the communication between the developers and players.

Recycling content in future patches<br />
There definitely is not a hard and fast rule about updating existing content. If we feel revamping existing content makes sense in the current state of the game and lore -- and we think it will be fun -- sure, it's a possibility. You definitely shouldn't expect this every patch though. In the grand scheme of World of Warcraft's history, we've reintroduced very little existing content per patch and expansion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/163078/is-old-content-going-to-be-redone-every-patch))<br />
<br />
And let's get real - we know why you're recycling old content. With the next Starcraft 2 expansion, Diablo 3, and an &quot;unannounced MMO&quot; all in production, I'm guessing the art team has its hands full. Recycling old content is an easy way to create a &quot;new&quot; instance with old art assets.<br />
There isn't a singular Blizzard Entertainment art team. Each franchise has its own art department. We don't just pull resources from one project to give more attention to another in the sense you're suggesting. This is why we have multiple development teams (which include art teams for each) and can work on multiple franchises simultaneously. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/163078/is-old-content-going-to-be-redone-every-patch))<br />
<br />
&quot;OMG ALL THE DEVS ARE GONE!&quot;<br />
That wasn't at all the context of the post to which I was responded. That player was suggesting that a singular art team directs their attention away from WoW to work on art for our other games. That's not true.<br />
<br />
Now, if an individual person does move onto a new project, their position is filled. Therefore, the resources are still there (which is why I said &quot;in the sense you're suggesting&quot;). This is how career advancement works at any company. How else do you account for a company's growth? You bring in new talent (or move them up from within the company) and train them under the current folks so they can eventually fill the vacancy.<br />
<br />
This talk about losing WoW developers, or that WoW is left to a &quot;B team&quot; is getting tiresome. There is no finite pool of talent and we have every intention of making sure WoW development remains very strong.<br />
<br />
All of this is practically besides the point anyway. All you've been told is some talented people who helped build WoW into what it is today have moved over to another project to help bring it to fruition. You don't know who those people are, what positions they held on the WoW team, or how many of them have moved onto other projects. Most of them, in fact, are programmers working to develop the systems and tech for a new project. And the programmers WoW has now are amazing. They've taken the original systems and improved upon them many times over.<br />
<br />
Just as an example, think back to how slowly UI improvements would be implemented in vanilla and TBC. Now there are scores of great UI improvements nearly every patch. That team is incredible and very experienced. Just the same, the class design team has hardly changed in years, save for a couple of additions (read: not subtractions).<br />
<br />
Every department at Blizzard has expanded immensely over the years to accommodate the growing playerbase, as well as our ambitions for the future of the company. You can look at our job opportunities page just to get an example for the talent search we have constantly going on.<br />
<br />
Bringing in new talent and growing the company from within is far from a bad thing. It's a great thing and has allowed us to develop several projects simultaneously without short-changing any of them. Anyone who says otherwise is working on an incredible amount of speculation and assumptions.<br />
<br />
And even still, the WoW development leadership remains largely unchanged. Every time I stop by to chat with these people -- the same people I've been interacting with for years now -- I'm inspired by their creativity, their talent, and their dedication to making this game mega-awesomesauce. ;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/163078/is-old-content-going-to-be-redone-every-patch))<br />

Ragnaros Model<br />
The problem is that you have no context or perspective on the model you've seen a static image of.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Standing next to the full-sized, animated model will give you a very different perspective when you're looking up from his toenail<br />
2) Knowing that he will only come out of his lava pool to reveal his full figure in a Heroic-only phase of the fight will give you a bit more context<br />
<br />
<br />
He's not just going to be running around the moment every raid reaches him. :) <br />
<br />
I don’t think a lot of you understand; perspective is a large part of art design. The designers probably designed the model looking upwards from his feet. I bet you Rags’ll look epic when you see him in person<br />
This is sort of what I was getting at with my first point. The perspective is completely different when a player character is standing near him. The proportions were designed with that in mind, which is why the screenshot of the model really doesn't do Ragnaros justice at all.

why does it mater? Its not going to be the same mount, and will probably not look as cool. Both the tiger(now the panther) and raptor mounts have been changed and are really lame compared to there previous models, and I highly expect the war bear to be the same way. I wouldnt even put it past them to just recolor the black bear mount lol.</div></div><hr />

No, he just isn't posting on the forums like he did. he is writing regular blog-style posts to describe changes, and probably is still coordinating things, but he's not going to post like he use to.

A lot of famous statues have this same issue. Typically, a statue that is of a over-scaled person, say David, are carved to be looked at from below looking up at them. So if you look at them head on, or from above, they're gonna look wrong. Looking at that picture, the scale of things very much felt to me like that's what was going on, that it was meant to be view from an angle other than head on.</div></div><hr />

awesome! Thanks for the response mate! Makes me sad though, GC's posts were always extremely insightful and I always felt like, even though the fanbase didn't &quot;know&quot; him, we sort of were on a good friends basis with him, he was the face of blizzard in terms of fan/company interaction.

All you have is a Datamined picture. You have no context, nor even confirmation it's finished. Stop acting like some high-and-mighty know-it-all. <br />

Agreed. There's only one mail bracer in all the endgame - off of Chimeron and I've downed him 5 times without seeing it. I had to form an arena team to get a +346 mail bracer, and it's loaded with resistance that I find useless. It's especially annoying since they're putting in gloves, which we have inspades (Purchase Tier, BH and off of lowly Halfus. Plus there's multiple good 346's while there's only one good 346 mail). THat's the only thing that's annoyed me about this update. Hopefully we can let them know and they can change the loot table.</div></div><hr />

You will only see his legs if you're on heroic mode in a particular situation. Read the post before you cry. <br />

The whining will shift to &quot;AMAGAWD Why is it only hardcore pve raiders that get to see Rag with legs!!&quot; and that will result in Blizzard changing the encounter, so that Rag will riverdance in the respective hometowns of everyone.

You people make me sick...if youre raiding and equipping 359 gear and up...WHY DO YOU CARE?<br />

Heaven forbid players who dont raid...or play for FUN....should be able to obtain some sort of decent gear<br />
<br />
Please...someone...ANYONE...explain to me with any shred of common sense why this bothers you in the least<br />

Shouldn't bother anyone really.. They're half decent upgrades from jp and hc blues, but still inferior to 359's</div></div><hr />

T11 gear will be on the Justice Point vendor, just not sure when. I'm assuming it's when Firelands comes out. <br />
<br />
Regardless, there's nothing to complain about. If you've been farming Heroic 5-mans as long as my casual ass has, you're probably sick of seeing Halls of Origination's loading screen 3+ times a week and the first PuG in there says &quot;full clear pls&quot;.

Ok, I'm annoyed with you people. Isn't Armani some clothing line or something? The bear and troll tribe are called AMANI. No R! Once they start wearing fabulous silk shirts and fancy pants with shoes, then they can change their names to be more stylish.<br />

<br />
Sure, because there aren't any epic quality items (even 359) that you can't disenchant, right? You can't guarantee that they'll be disenchantable when the patch goes live. There have been items that simply can't be disenchanted, and I'm sure they were that way in PTR as well. There's logic why they couldn't be disenchanted, though of course it would be great if they could. <br />
<br />
Also, I always welcome new mounts. I have the Amani War Bear that I prefer to use as my ground mount, and I don't have anything against gaining another mount in addition. There are people who prefer the new look and people who stick with the old, but who cares? You don't lose anything because someone else gains something. (Note: I got my bear the &quot;proper&quot; way with guild runs)</div></div><hr />

You got epics for doing TBC heroics........................<br />
Seriously people, a lot of the &quot;wrath babies lulz&quot; guys started in wrath themselves and just hoped onto the bandwagon but got not freaking clue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawlers forum posts were never good, they never said anything of importance, the reason why he wont post anymore is because people kept quoting his older posts which were totally contradicted his new posts. And that is not surprising, he is an employee of a big cooperation and just has to get the company line out there, it is not necessarily what he believes.<br />

Wow. Okay, apparently trying to be reasonable rather than spewing mindless venom is being a 'fanboy' now. Okay. Apologies if I upset you somehow. Let me use an example instead of a statement then. <br />
<br />
Look at the four mini-elemental bosses in the vault of lights. They all have a very simple base model - in a render, you'd see a very very dull entity. But in-game, with the transparency effect on the airboss, and the fire effects on the fire boss, etc, they come to life. That's what I meant by 'context'. If you've never worked with a render environment, fair play to you - but the particle effects make the game, especially this one. The engine can't really handle pretty models in bulk, so particle effects are used instead, giving a similar effect for far fewer resources.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong - I'm not a huge fan of the WoW graphics. I'm not big on cartoony styles. But somehow Blizzard makes them engaging, and I can't quantify how. So, I trust them to get it right. You obviously don't. That's cool - a pain for you, I get that - but cool. <br />

Ok sorry I apologize, I exclude you from fanboys since you are reasonable.<br />

My point is that the model just looks goofy, I know that there will be tons of effects and stuff and maybe it will look better. But look at the &quot;normal&quot; elemental models that came with Cata, I think they look pretty bad ass even in modelviewer, the other elemental lords look great too imo.</div></div><hr />

Do you know Deathwing, the big black dragon that's supposedly the icon of this expansion? Ever since the release people have been saying how impressive it was to see the model in the game and how huge he was compared to the images they had seen of him. The thing about images is that they're flat and two-dimensional and it's actually a third-dimensional animated model that you can really only experience fully in a third-dimension environment.<br />
<br />
So it's not your &quot;opinion&quot; that counts here because you can't form an actual opinion until you've actually seen the model for its worth, you're presuming it looks &quot;goofy&quot; which is the same as judging a book by its cover.<br />

I also think it's a really reasonable change to take the developer feedback to a blog and let communication go through moderated questions and feedback because truth to be told the forums are so chaotic/vulgar/messy/rude/pick your word at times it's not only bothersome for the designers to communicate with their own community but also bothersome for the individual to read through the trash people come up with in a forum thread.<br />
<br />
For instance, I tried to start an in-depth discussion on the Colossus Smash change affected Warrior mechanics and design philosophy and half the responses were &quot;trolls&quot; that only read and replied to the title widely misinterpreting the meaning of it, then after the second page a &quot;regular forumer&quot; began picking arguments with the actual debating posters and derailed the thread completely by the third page. Meaningful and constructive discussion just don't last five minutes on massively large public forums - it is a fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He stopped posting in December because he finally realized what we all have known.. the official forums are garbage and he is wasting his time trying to communicate in an intelligent way. No matter how he tried to explain things, his threads were always filled with ´ghostcrawler lost an arena match against my spec, that is why he is nerfing us´ or ´gc doesn´t play my class and doesn´t understand it´. The noise ratio is way to high and everything he did say was twisted out of proportion. It happens to every dev in every game.. there is never a dev that can have a ´conversation´with players... they are either monologues (where the dev doesn´t reply to comments) or else the ragequit because of the idiot posters.<br />

These items cannot be disenchanted (as of now) and I doubt they will be, if they really wish to keep them very rare (since they did remove alchemy trinket disenchanting ability etc).<br />

I suspect that is temporary and will change on live realms. There is no way that they are going to have two heroics full of vendor epics. Worst-case I can see them having the 353 epics DE to heavenly shards instead of maelstrom crystals, but sooner or later the maelstrom crystal market will crash and the high-end enchants will become more affordable.</div></div><hr />

Also the only epic mail enhancement/hunter bracer are those from Chimaeron. On all those listed 353 epic slots you currently have atleast two 359 options. Why not add a minor option to the only slot that has only one chance to drop per week? That just totally not listening to what people report in the PTR forums...</div></div><hr />

Ever since the release people have been saying how impressive it was to see the model in the game and how huge he was compared to the images they had seen of him. The thing about images is that they're flat and two-dimensional and it's actually a third-dimensional animated model that you can really only experience fully in a third-dimension environment.<br />
<br />
So it's not your &quot;opinion&quot; that counts here because you can't form an actual opinion until you've actually seen the model for its worth, you're presuming it looks &quot;goofy&quot; which is the same as judging a book by its cover.[COLOR=&quot;red&quot;]<br />
<br />
You are talking about size, the Deathchin model would still look awesome if it were the size of a kodo although it would be a lot less intimidating.<br />
<br />
And dude, a model is nothing but a cover, a model is only visual. Your comparison doesn't hold water, you cannot judge a book by its cover because the content is important but here you only get the visual and the visual sux. Maybe the fight will be the most epic in history of mmorpgs but rag would still look retarded.</div></div><hr />

What? No I'm not. Deathwing's appearance in the game is more than just model scaling. When Deathwing appears in a zone the sky turns red, he flies above the player like a large shadow and his breath leaves a large trail of sprouting fire. This is all part of the impact the model makes in its in-game appearance.<br />
<br />
You can't judge a 3D model on a 2D canvas. Animation and environment are a large part of a game model's artwork and neither of those are present on a data-mined screen-shot. What you are doing is exactly like judging a book by its cover. You're not seeing the whole picture, only a fraction, and the only opinion you can form from that is of that fraction. You're trying to say the model looks bad, but you haven't seen the model. You've seen a data-mined flat printed screen-shot of a model. What model looks its best like that? That was the point about Deathwing, not size.<br />
<br />
The only thing you can conclude is that the model might look bad from your opinion on the screen-shot, but you know you have no idea how Blizzard is going to render it and their experience at least gives them the benefit of the doubt.</div></div><hr />

I'm looking forward to doing ZG and ZA with my guild, but as someone else said, I feel they're just giving baddies epics. Of course, baddies won't just be able to queue up for ZG or ZA, you need a 346 ilvl? Either way, I still know baddies with 346 ilvl, but whatever, at least the super baddie arms warrior who lost a duel to a disc priest won't be getting loot, hopefully.(he doesn't have 346 ilvl, woot!)<br />

It still looks like shit regardless of the context. If I made a boss that was just a grey gouraud cube and said &quot;No way, it doesn't suck, it will turn into a rainbow unicorn on heroic mode, so it's good.&quot; no, it is still terrible shit. Most people never see heroic modes and the legs look bad, regardless of any context.<br />

What? I am talking about the model and the model of Ragnaros SUX with those goofy legs. Animations and environment wont make those god forsaken legs look good. Deathchin always looked awesome, the fact that he does crazy things makes him even more awesome, but if the model sucked it would suck in game too.<br />
I don't see a god damn difference between the Deathchin from the SW screenshots and the Deathchin in game, they look the same.<br />
You can make a good Judgement about a model just from screenshots because the model doesn't look different once you see it in the game, what your monitor shows you is 2D anyway.<br />

No, sheeple need to stop defending blizzard like they're their 5-yr old lil brother. Recycling has gotten out of hand and is getting even worse as time marches on. I don't want this old content revamped anymore, I want NEW content. This &quot;theme&quot; for Cata with the old world coming alive again is a spectacular fraud pulled off by blizzard to cheap out on the art and development teams, that's it, and that's all. Just like their &quot;item model&quot; teams too, the amount of recycled gear is disgusting. Druids looking like Tiered Rogues... DK's looking like Tiered Wars...

No Warrior DpS Ranged weapon. I realise that it's difficult as that Warrior Ranged Weapon would only be beneficial to one class, but make it so it'll be good for Tanks too. Master / Expertise or Mastery / Hit would be good, or even Expertise / Hit. But hey ho.<br />

The problem is that you have no context or perspective on the model you've seen a static image of.<br />
<br />
* 1) Standing next to the full-sized, animated model will give you a very different perspective when you're looking up from his toenail<br />
* 2) Knowing that he will only come out of his lava pool to reveal his full figure in a Heroic-only phase of the fight will give you a bit more context<br />
<br />
<br />
He's not just going to be running around the moment every raid reaches him. <br />
Do them really believe that bullshit? No perspective can change the fact that he fell out of character with legs. They could have made a joke about the Old Gods bargain was giving him legs (OMG Little Mermaid), they could have created some lore stuff, showing that taking a form with legs would be part of a plan, or some side-effect of empowerment; but simply saying it's perspective? Come on... That backfire on them.<br />
P.S.: As stating that those legs always have been there, but a twirl from lava pools hid them. Oh, come on...</div></div><hr />

I LOL at the people, who doesnt want anyone else get their bear, because THEY got it long time ago...<br />
<br />
Most bear owners got the mount by bribing a better guild for a raid spot, they got the mount with bought Chinese gold... then they jumped around outside AH with their epeen pretending they did something extraordinary. Now that the mount is coming back, their epeen isn't amused. That's what all this whine is about.<br />

Hey look, another one that tries to justify their bitching by calling anyone who disagrees with their opinion a fanboy (or sheeple)! Here's how it works for you folks who don't quite understand the concept of video games and free will. If the makers of a game implement something that you don't like, you can always quit, and it's even alright to go out with a bang, and insult the crap out of the companies mother! However, for those of us who will continue to pay for the game because we may actually like the changes (GOD FORBID!!), we would prefer not to be insulted by some immature forum goer on an ego trip who thinks his/her opinion is almighty.<br />
<br />
I'm not defending Blizzard, but you're merely insulting people for liking something you don't, and that makes you a not nice person, don't be one of those....</div></div><hr />

Well this particular dagger speed does not fit either hand correctly. 1.8 are usual main hands and 1.4 are usual off hands. Using that dagger as an off hand would be less dps than using a green level 85 dagger. As a MH i'm fairly sure blue daggers would still be better if they were 1.8's.</div></div><hr />

Like I said before, I am hoping this isn't a full list, as stated by Boub too, it doesn't seem to be, I'm a moonkin and while the spirit to hit conversion is nice, there doesnt seem to be much haste/mastery spell leather, all spirit/crit... didn't even notice spell leather shoulders, the cloth list looks alot more filled out.<br />

FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF<br />

Seriously, what kind of crack are they on? Every other class has multiple options, albeit not all are the best, but OPTIONS none the less for primary weapon. Combat has a bunch of options for some reason, but there remains ONE raid MH. One that hasn't dropped for my guild since we've been killing Omnotron, 14 weeks in a row. And we have 3 good and active rogues. Does nobody else see a problem here? Don't even get me started on offhands. One on the last boss of a raid, and the only other an exceptionally rare trash drop in the raid that has almost no trash? HHHHHNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGG.</div></div><hr />

I never said it was, those are your words. When I draw an illustration, which is still a largely different art from animation and modeling, I go through a process that has some similarities to creating the visual impression of a concept. Simplified, I am talking about the impression you get when you first lay your eyes on a piece of artwork or a scene in WoW. If I wanted to draw, say, Ragnaros I could begin with sketching him and drawing his figure on a white canvas. This would be the equivalent of seeing a screen-shot of a model alone because when I make such an illustration I also consider the scene, the background, the colors and atmosphere, all things that are part of the illustration's visual impact. For example, it is one thing to see a drawing of Ragnaros on a white canvas, it is another thing to see a drawing of Ragnaros in a large cave filled with magma with the red atmosphere from the lava facing off against an army of adventures.<br />
<br />
When you visualize a boss in a third-dimensional environment you have many more advanced elements to work with like animation, sound, dimension and so on. All these things are a very important part of the visual effect and the experience of the encounter. No one has seen these things yet, they have just seen a flat screen-shot of the model and that's also the point Blizzard is trying to make.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, I have to tip my hat to you - your icons are really nice and way better than the default WoW icons! Do you work as an industrial pictographer (designer of pictographic manuals and safety toons and such) irl? And is there a mod that can swap your really nice icons for the default WoW icons?<br />
I just finished graduating from what would be a college and work as an artist as a hobby where I do art commissions as a spare time job. I have written a guide on icons here (http://bogrim.deviantart.com/journal/25531826/).</div></div><hr />

The perspective of those legs changes nothing. If he was bigger than Deathwing, or even as big as he is in Molten Core, it wouldn't change anything. Why? Because he has legs, and those legs look like crap.<br />
<br />
QQ QQ QQ. People really make too much of a big deal of somethings as stupid as Ragnaros having LEGS. For real people this has got to be the stupidest thing Ive ever had to see people act like cry babies over.</div></div><hr />
