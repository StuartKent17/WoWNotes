Warlords of Draenor - Death Knight Tier 17 Armor Sets<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Death Knight Tier 17 sets, now complete with the Mythic set that was added in the latest alpha build.<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3940-Warlords-of-Draenor-Raid-Finder-Armor-Sets-Draenei-Guard-Armor-Set-Blue-Tweets-Art). <br />

Warlords of Draenor - New Character Model Animations<br />
Muffinus reminded everyone that animations on several of the new character models aren't final and still a work in progress, so don't worry if your favorite new model isn't perfect just yet!<br />

Blue Post - Where is WoW Going?<br />
It's an interesting question!<br />
<br />
If we stay on a steady course we would be a game with ever increasing complexity. More and more abilities, more systems, and more and more choices, all layered on top of each other--to a point where it would be impossible to realistically develop the game. We have to be constantly mindful not only of what we're implementing that's new, but of allowing systems to grow increasingly complex over time. Expansions are always a good time to take stock of the systems we have, the complexity that exists, and be really critical of ourselves and the choices we've made that got us to where we are. Two of our big design philosophies as a company are &quot;concentrated coolness&quot;, and creating compelling gameplay through interesting choices (vs. lots of choices for the sake of having lots of them). These tend to overlap a lot, especially in the case of ability bloat, which we're trying to reign in specifically in Warlords. <br />
<br />
To your point about talent trees, they weren't concentrated or cool. There were a bunch of buttons, and most of them were things like 2% increases to stats. They definitely felt more &quot;gamey&quot;, like you were smart for figuring out interesting builds, but at the end of the day there was effectively one or two right answers, and figuring out interesting builds for the most part meant you were actually just sub-optimal and didn't know it. Many dozens of insanely smart designers played/worked on/gave feedback on the old talent trees for years and years, and we went through a lot of changes and iterations, and we came to the long-time-coming conclusion that talent trees just don't work for us and the types of systems we present in our games. We keep that learning experience with us.<br />
<br />
Anyway, back to the real topic, it's no ones fault but our own that systems become increasingly complex over time, and so it's our job to be mindful of when systems are becoming overly complex and bloated with choices that aren't interesting or fun. It's normal and healthy to stop, take a moment, take a close look at what you're doing, and if those are the right choices. Constantly charging ahead with no self introspection leads to a situation that is less and less manageable, and potentially dangerous or damaging.<br />
<br />
Deep and engaging gameplay doesn't need lots of choices to be fun as long as the choices are interesting, and feel rewarding when you make one.<br />
<br />

Beasts of the Savage Lands - Shadowmoon Valley<br />
The lush Shadowmoon Valley appears peaceful and idyllic, lulling many would-be adventurers into a false sense of security as they explore its rolling hills and violet forests. But countless hidden perils lie waiting behind the tranquil façade, and only those well-armed with knowledge can hope to survive. What dangers lurk in the shadows?<br />
<br />
Riverbeasts<br />
Adventurers are often misled by the seemingly docile riverbeasts. Though slow to anger, once disturbed, a charging riverbeast is a ferocious sight: 4,000 pounds of fat and muscle storming toward its target like a runaway tram. Roaming draenei rangari have long been astounded by how much damage a rampaging riverbeast can take before it’s brought down, and draenei children are taught to keep a wide berth of shallow waters. Riverbeasts are characterized by their rock-like skin, likely developed during the early days of Draenor’s prehistory, when creatures of stone dueled for supremacy against the chaotic flora. Those looking to take a riverbeast as a trophy should take note of their durable armored flesh and tendency to charge unexpectedly. <br />
<br />

http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/mvbar853.png<br />
<br />
Podlings<br />
A number of Draenor’s indigenous species blur the line between plant and animal, and the so-called podlings are the most vicious and chaotic of their ilk. Small and seemingly harmless, they work together to capture their prey, attacking only when they have numerical superiority. Explorers who pay attention to the color of podlings’ flowering buds can ascertain whether they favor poison, ensnaring, or physical attacks to incapacitate their victims. Once podlings have overwhelmed their quarry, they will drag the unlucky creature down into the weeds to fertilize a new generation. The clear lesson for adventurers: looks can be deceiving!<br />
<br />

<br />
Elekk<br />
The majestic elekk graze contentedly across the grassy plains of Draenor, relying on their huge size and the support of the herd to keep predators at bay. Draenei explorers have determined that the animals pose no threat, as long as their young aren’t endangered or their water supply jeopardized. With the endurance to cover great distances and the ability to defend themselves by ramming or stomping attackers, these beasts have emerged as the draenei transport of choice. Explorers should take note of persistent draenei rumors that the Thunderlord Clan orcs torment and twist terrified elekk into vicious weapons of war, covering them in armor plating and inciting them to rampage when turned loose on their foes. Beware!<br />
<br />

<br />
Draenor Ancients<br />
It was only very recently that draenei rangari managed to communicate with these enormous sentient trees, but wildly different ways of life—not to mention a completely different perception of time—have made further interaction difficult. The ancients get their name from their analogues on Azeroth; they are tied closely to a prehistoric plant lineage that unites much of Draenor’s flora and places them in opposition to the creatures of stone. These enigmatic ancients remain in the same area for hundreds of years and are reluctant to move unless their home is threatened. Adventurers should be cautious when harvesting the valley’s lumber, as they may find the forest fighting back.<br />
<br />

Shadowmoon Valley is a dangerous place, but there are many deadly threats still to be discovered across the savage world of Draenor. Until next time, stay alive . . . if you can.<br />

Dislike Sniper Training. Not fun imo. A class that has a dmg-on-the-move niche is now discouraged from moving.<br />
Not &quot;discouraged from moving&quot;, but rather &quot;encouraged to move strategically.&quot; Big difference. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/488112231372959745))<br />

New Elemental mastery, procs on Multi-Strikes? Searing Totem? Fire/Earth/Air elemental attacks? (including melee) Thanks.<br />
It's automatic when you've recently attacked something; doesn't &quot;proc from&quot; anything. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/488115168019087360))<br />
ah so no proc, just auto applies on damage/100% uptime, so more mastery increases the damage? (sry if bad ?'s, not in beta )<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/488119629080838146))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Please make Conquest cap obtainable in Ashran (if slow). Plenty of us want high-end pvp in the world outside of 2v2-10v10.<br />
There will be ways to get conquest in Ashran but no way to increase your cap. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/488324609465253888))<br />
<br />
Any plans/intention to stop melee dominance on beta? Do you agree that their mobility and caster lockdown is too good?<br />
Definitely an issue we continue to discuss. Solid feedback is starting to come through. Keep it coming. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/488325263038894080))<br />

We wouldn't make such a drastic change. But it could use a visual update and some graveyard fixes. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/488326144349831168))<br />
<br />
Using seamless transfer tech to run/balance Ashran separately from rest of Draenor. People in your Ashran should be drawn from the same pool of players as your CRZ group. So no crossover between PvP, PvE, RP, and RP PvP realms. What's less clear is exactly how to balance it. Need to cap population per &quot;instance&quot; on some realms. Should say &quot;realm groups&quot;. Sorry. What exactly this pop is, and what to do when we exceed is something we're testing on Beta. So play Ashran and give feedback. We'll be watch Ashran server perf to see how to balance pop vs. lag. (kurtismcc (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/490328521915387904))<br />
key takeaway is that the Ashran battle takes place in a completely different instance than the faction city (nite_moogle (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/490328833120161793))<br />
Yeah, I think the cities are just outside. Ashran is convenient, but not integrated. (kurtismcc (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/490329276806209537))<br />

In other news, today we successfully hotfixed two spawn changes on beta that previously would have required restarts<br />
I am probably in the minority but I find all the tech changes in WoD absolutely fascinating.<br />
You'd be surprised how much tech is refactored quietly in the background. We're constantly trying to improve even the oldest code (SeTec9 (https://twitter.com/SeTec9/status/490361750567809025))<br />

<br />
So when devs make a stupid change you think they prefer no feedback? Regardless if you consider it to be whining or not. <br />
<br />
We should whine about it.. especially considering we're going from a god damn Orc raid in MoP to even more Orc raids in WoD and we get to enjoy our slack time in either a quickly put together Orc centered faction hub OR our very own Orc garrison... I'd be less annoyed by this entire change if it wasn't yet another Orc camp but something from ANY of the other races. I can only imagine Alliance people getting fed up with human camps everywhere they go aswel.<br />
<br />
Karabor/Bladespire would've been a nice change of scenery and it's worth whining about tbh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Stupid&quot; is subjective. Player feedback gets boring when the same moot points are getting thrown at you over and over again. I feel bad for the devs and CM's, they should just stop responding to anything about the cities, its obvious that the only answer whiners will be happy with is &quot;Okay, we'll spend some extra time modelling, texturing and populating new cities&quot; - no winning for Blizzard, so they have to just stay quiet and wait for people to get bored of whining.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure he mentioned twice that they're trying to make an exceptional game which will actually get released - I guess it's more about starting to work on a load of plans and art assets for X and then being pressured to drop all of that work and focus on something completely different which only has its exterior complete. I'm sure they have a timeline and its internally more complicated than what most people are saying.</div></div><hr />

If the expansion's not finished, it's not finished. I know money's an issue and all that and unlike other games, if we stop playing they're going to lose a lot of it. But still, as tired of MoP as I am, i'd rather wait longer for the expansion than needed if it means getting the game to as perfect a state as ever. Cutting massive things like an entire city to get it out faster is.. blegh :(<br />
<br />
I've been playing the WoD beta and the game is gorgeous, the zones are beautiful, it's an improvement on so many levels and I can't wait for everyone to play it - But this Ashran hub crap is so... eugh. I'm not as bothered about it now as I was before because Draenor is still exceptional and it looks like we'll have plenty of reason to continue to run around the zones regardless of whether or not our city is there; But it's still incredibly disappointing. Bladespire and Karabor could easily be the coolest looking cities to date, and we've just been massively cock blocked. I don't know about the rest of you, but i'd wait months for them no problem - We're already waiting ages. But then I guess it does just come back down to that sub count thing, I guess I don't blame them too much, but it's still disappointing.</div></div><hr />

This happens on pretty much any game ever, its just the players don't get to see all those games in detail 2 years before they're released to see the process happening. Its not like they took Karabor and the horde ogre city away from you, because you never had them, they never existed, they were never made, plans were changed. If you can't understand the process and are just going to whinge like a spoilt child every time something changes, maybe you just shouldn't read about the expansion until its in a more final state and save yourself the pain.<br />

Honestly, Blizzard are damned if they do and damned if they don't. If they don't release info and wait until the game/expansion is furthur along in development so they can give solid details, they get crucified for not giving out any new info (even though is how about 99% of games are developed anyway), but then they go the extra mile above and beyond to make the community part of the development process and share the details with everyone as they evolve, and they still get crucified for changing things.<br />

I think most players are just curious as to what the hell Blizzard has been doing with all this seemingly uninterrupted design time for Warlords of Draenor and why there seems to be so much &quot;sacrifice&quot; needed.<br />
<br />
I could be wrong as I have no idea how much time/work it takes to create an expansion, but in the past, they've seemed to have so much more on their plate in terms of balancing new content being created for the existing expansion, and content being designed for the new expansion. They do not have that problem with MoP as it's been mostly &quot;maintenance&quot; for the past 10 months.<br />
<br />
Again, I'm just speaking from an outsider's prospective. I could be completely wrong.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, this is what they get for trying to be so transparent. Personally, I don't like it. All the Twatter feedback and giving us glimpses of what's under the hood. And of course, the biggest culprit yet is all this fucking data-mining. I remember when there was a time when the entire player base was almost completely in the dark concerning the development of an expansion. Alpha was pretty much hush-hush, beta was extremely light and we just let Blizzard do their thing with the confidence that they knew what they were doing and we get what we get.<br />
<br />
But now, it's just a bunch of bored and tired players complaining about the loss or change of X feature, all because Blizzard shoots their mouth off or a site like MMO-Champion is so desperate for traffic that it posts every single scrap of information they can dig out of the game files. Afterall, who knows how many features were scrapped or changed in previous expansions - it's just that we didn't know about them.<br />
<br />
I think there's something to be said about the phrase &quot;the less we know, the better&quot;. All of this negative feedback Blizzard is getting from the playerbase is the result of telling us too much and jumping the gun about features that were no where near finished.<br />
<br />
It used to be that the expansions sold themselves; we didn't need Blizzard to show us or tell us how awesome they were going to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a difference between a &quot;wishlist of features&quot; and advertising said features. This is not some unique standard Blizzard is held to; every developer is going to get serious shit from their fans if the game they show in previews and the game that ends up getting released don't line up. And in the case of the capitals, every explanation Blizzard comes up with sounds like a big fat lie. Especially when the truth is so obvious.<br />
<br />
I mean, good lord, the fact they've actually managed to convince people that building two locations from the ground-up was somehow less time consuming than retrofitting locations that they had already built is amazing. Just goes to show that if you repeat a lie often enough, no matter how obvious, people will begin to believe it. Do you really believe the Shrines, for example, were specially designed to be &quot;ideal capitals&quot;? Of course not! They put up a building, and fit the NPCs and portals wherever they could. They didn't even bother considering that people might actually want to use their mounts, so they stuffed in that stupid fast-running mechanic to compensate. ZERO thought was put into that design, so to imply it would take some massive redesign to make already existing locations into capitals is just silly. With how many mini-hubs (like Lion's Landing/Domination Point) are just NPCs and portals lined up in a row, it should show you just how easy it is.<br />
<br />
I don't agree with complaining for the sake of complaining, but I think it is very reasonable to believe that Blizzard will cave if the fanbase applies enough pressure. Using faction hubs to encourage PvP participation is simply not worth the cost. We want real faction hubs damnit!</div></div><hr />

What players seem to want is more more more more ad infinitum, and when the reality of dev time kicks in their yell about laziness.<br />
I guess that's the price for transparency in development. Can't bitch and moan about things we never heard about. Apparently that's better, somehow.<br />
<br />
I don't know why the faction hubs would take so much time to finish, but I do know that means they focus on something else. Kinda the way resource management works.<br />
<br />
Also, this endless talk about where we go to afk is getting old</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's such a disappointment !!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and BTW, they really said at Blizzcon that Bladespire and Karabor would be the new capitals. They said it, and now they say they never intended to.... They just lie to us. And I went into the untextured Karabor and I can put every NPC in the right place to make it a capital. In the hall behind, with big stairs : portals on the mezzanine, quests NPCS at the bottom (like in the Shrine), in the big hall when you enter the place, make it just like the hall in the Shrine but you have the bak on the small platform behind the big textured thing, and the AH, the you have two smaller rooms on each side of that big hall, make it the same as the Shrine, one room is the hearth, the other is about professions.<br />
<br />
Voilà, you have a capital that's far better looking than a level 2 Garrison put in front of Ashran...</div></div><hr />

At blizzcon they said they were ahead of time in terms of development of the expansion in comparison to MoP. Yet all they seem to be doing lately is cutting corners to make a release date. I don't care if they have to change things like hubs or anything really, but the fact that they don't say we got set behind due to x,y,z we are doing our best to get as much content as we can into the expansion, however due to those circumstances we have to cut back on a,b,c.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They told us that those would be our new capitals for the entire x-pac- then they scrapped it. They recieved over 20 more people from the titan project and still this is the longest drought of content in the history of WoW and half of what they said we would get with WoD we aren't getting because they don't have the time? Not to mention at blizzcon they said WoD was further along then any other x-pac. Seems to me that blizzcon is there just to tell the playerbase nothing more then half truths.<br />

Perhaps original concepts were designed, even in-game, and scrapped. This seems very possible, given the fact that we were originally going to be able to pick where our Garrison would be. It's definitely possible that they had gone fairly far down that road artistically before they decided that option didn't make sense for the game (or maybe THAT would take too much art time). It's unfortunate, but I don't think we're being snowballed on this specific issue.<br />
<br />
That being said, we have plenty of reason to be frustrated. The lack of content is driving us all a bit batty.<br />

I haven't gotten to spend as much time with the alpha/beta as I'd like, but I do like what I've seen so far. That much is reassuring to me.</div></div><hr />

No one feels &quot;entitled&quot; to anything.

Blizzcon development panels aren't really advertisements. You can't be too upset when your challenging dungeons, dance studio or path of the titans gets scrapped after only being mentioned briefly at a Blizzcon panel. It will only result in Blizzard being less willing to share interesting concepts and ideas, and instead force them to only share the boring stuff that has already been developed or which they are 99% sure they can deliver on.<br />
<br />
Basically, a vocal minority ruining it for the rest of us who take Blizzcon panels as a grain of salt.<br />

<br />
Activision Blizzard is making a huge mistake and it is going to backfire on them in lower sales and dropped subs. (The cuts are most likely a result of corporate pressure to meet a deadline) Many of the PvPers in in the Beta are even unsatisfied with the way it is all designed.<br />

And even more sad to see what the community has become because of the constant lies and shady practices done to them.<br />
<br />
Who ARE YOU Blizz!?<br />
<br />
Look at Diablo 3 and what we were shown/told and what vanilla D3 turned out to be.<br />
Remember when Blizz said they learned their lesson and that they would never repeat the long wait that we had from ICC to Cata release and then they did it again in DS and now even worse in WoD? Cuttiing corners for WoD all over the place. Scrapping all kinds of originally advertised features etc... Starting over with Titan. The whole company seems to be a mess. Something we have seen a few times in the past when Activision takes over another company. It eats it from the inside out till they end up just liquidating it and still slapping its name on the box of a game to try to sell more units.<br />
<br />
I mean what is the point of paying hundreds of dollars for a ticket to Blizzcon when 70% of the information you are told there is completely false?<br />
<br />
I think I am really done with WoW after 10 years of playing off an on. I think Im done with Blizz products all-together. This isn't the Blizz from my youth that made amazing quality games. Just another group of cash grabbing shady game devs that are trying to squeeze every last cent out of us they can until their ship goes under from the Activision Iceberg they hit.</div></div><hr />

Seriously I don't mind the hubs being posted outside of Ashran, it makes sense somewhat to have us near the field of battle.

These two iconic locations, huge parts of Warcraft lore, left open for use in future expansions, where we might actually be able to do some really cool shit there. Raids, dungeons, scenarios, possibly world events! Instead of a place where people go afk before their raid starts, or spam trade looking for 2s carries and YOLO RBGs, or troll with anal [random achievement/ability] idiocy.

Exactly! It's not like the shrines were a master piece. City hubs are just places of convenience where everyone can congregate.<br />

Unless they're wanting to save these places for something else in the future and don't want to waste a potential patch on a city hub losing some future content they have planned. I don't know.<br />

Would be cool at some point if we could just retake Shattrath for good and turn that back into a city hub.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
My guess here is that the Garrisons ended up taking a lot more art time than they originally anticipated. Perhaps original concepts were designed, even in-game, and scrapped. This seems very possible, given the fact that we were originally going to be able to pick where our Garrison would be. It's definitely possible that they had gone fairly far down that road artistically before they decided that option didn't make sense for the game (or maybe THAT would take too much art time). It's unfortunate, but I don't think we're being snowballed on this specific issue.<br />
<br />
That being said, we have plenty of reason to be frustrated. The lack of content is driving us all a bit batty.<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten to spend as much time with the alpha/beta as I'd like, but I do like what I've seen so far. That much is reassuring to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's especially disappointing thinking that Garrisons could have put everything so much more behind schedule when you consider the fact that they will probably be main features of this expansion and then forgotten or never updated again. I could be wrong, it may be different. If it stays around I see it sticking around because they find a way to incorporate cash shop items into it. But even at that, they still don't seem like something that would take a team of people that have been designing games for 10 years months upon months to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We should whine about it.. especially considering we're going from a god damn Orc raid in MoP to even more Orc raids in WoD and we get to enjoy our slack time in either a quickly put together Orc centered faction hub OR our very own Orc garrison... I'd be less annoyed by this entire change if it wasn't yet another Orc camp but something from ANY of the other races. I can only imagine Alliance people getting fed up with human camps everywhere they go aswel.<br />
<br />
Karabor/Bladespire would've been a nice change of scenery and it's worth whining about tbh.<br />
<br />
No, you shouldn't whine about it. Whining is NEVER a good thing.<br />
<br />
Constructive feedback, critical or positive, is useful. As is knowing the reasons for a change, and knowing how to ask questions in a polite and inquisitive manner.<br />

Biggest expansion to date? LOLOLOLOL.<br />
<br />
Disprove the assertion rather then 'loling' as a responce. <br />
<br />
WoD seems to have a huge amount of content in the works. Just because it lacks a new playable race or class doesn't mean its not a huge expansion.<br />

<br />
Man, I get that they'd like to be open about criticism and respond, but I would not have chosen that jerk-off. Every word he writes is just confrontational. There is literally nothing Bashiok or anyone could say that would make them reconsider their &quot;Blizzard are lazy money-grubbers who'd rather rehash than innovate&quot; stance.<br />
<br />
Shouldn't even respond to asshats like that guy. Find someone who makes the same point (there are quite a few) without being an abrasive jerk, and respond to them.<br />
<br />
Very much in agreement.<br />

Stupid, stupid, fucking stupid. The whining about these damn faction cities in WoD is getting downright ridiculous. All the devs should just tweet &quot;NO MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT KARABOR/BLADESPIRE WILL BE ANSWERED BY ANY BLIZZARD DEV.&quot; (Perhaps an exaggeration, I know) Think critically for a second. These two iconic locations, huge parts of Warcraft lore, left open for use in future expansions, where we might actually be able to do some really cool shit there. Raids, dungeons, scenarios, possibly world events! Instead of a place where people go afk before their raid starts, or spam trade looking for 2s carries and YOLO RBGs, or troll with anal [random achievement/ability] idiocy. If these fucking pinheads can look past their own damn noses and get over their childish &quot;but you PROMISED!!!&quot; attitudes, maybe they will see that there is a chance for something greater to be added to the game.<br />
<br />
Yep. Potentially both locations are now freed up for more usage as actual content - dungeons, raids, questchains, etc. Plus if the Vale was a proof of concept, potentially Draenor's landscape can change over time...<br />
<br />
Plus we can still AFK there while waiting for queues. No biggy.</div></div><hr />

WoD seems to have a huge amount of content in the works. Just because it lacks a new playable race or class doesn't mean its not a huge expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why? They never listed why they believed WoD is the biggest expansion to date.<br />
<br />
But let's see. What ARE we getting?<br />
<br />
Stat squish, new stats.<br />
Garrisons.<br />
New continent and 10 levels.<br />
Gear tech.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I missing something? Oh, and character models which have been advertised as a feature since day 1 but will come for free in a patch regardless of whether you purchase the expansion. As with the stat squish. So I don't really count those in terms of expansion features.<br />
<br />
They do still take dev time though, so I'll give you that in terms of what's taking so long. <br />
<br />
Ashran. Not followed it too closely but we had Wintergrasp in Wrath and Isle in Cataclysm so I fail to see how it's some huge deal. I feel like it's going to be a bit of a flop once everything gets out. Or something they just keep having to go back and work on. <br />
<br />
The new continent and a few dungeons/raids/raid difficulty is stuff that they should have a pretty good process down for making at this point so I doubt they're struggling on that front.<br />
<br />
Gear tech they probably had a pretty decent idea how to do, as with the new rares due to these being implemented at least a little bit on Timeless Isle between tokens that adjust to your spec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, I finally remembered what I'm missing that makes this the biggest expansion to date!!!!<br />
<br />
Thrall is getting ANOTHER model update! We lost 2 raid tiers but we got the newest addition of popped collar Thrall added to the game. Why should we give Yriel a completely unique model when we could just slap on a few custom features and let Thrall have some more time in the spotlight? Yessssss!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, you are missing something. WoD is the expansion that is actually bringing in new character models and the stat squish. Without WoD, you wouldnt have those items so regardless of how you view it, they are still part of 6.0 and given out to every previous expansion for free. Count em.<br />
<br />
Also noteworthy is the stat squish affects every aspect of the game from vanilla to Warlords. It's not just a Warlords stat squish or character model.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This is still new content nonetheless and they've learned from history and put a lot of emphasis on this much like Wintergrasp v2.0 (ignore the Cata pvp zone).<br />
<br />
<br />
The new continent and a few dungeons/raids/raid difficulty is stuff that they should have a pretty good process down for making at this point so I doubt they're struggling on that front.<br />
<br />
Agreed mostly. They've only had an expansion to get the &quot;process down&quot; though so there's still a learning curve, esp tied into the stat squish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gear tech they probably had a pretty decent idea how to do, as with the new rares due to these being implemented at least a little bit on Timeless Isle between tokens that adjust to your spec.<br />
<br />
Indifferent here. Not seeing this point you are making. It's a side note and not a real feature so maybe that supports your general argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Ignoring this troll comment since we all know modelers and texture artists for 1 model dont equate to missing entire raid tiers involving many different departments.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets not forget all of the different tier sets require a much larger art department. Not many comments have been pointing this out but there have always been complaints about not enough differentiation or variation from tier sets. PVP simply gets a recolored blah blah. That hasnt been the case this current expansion and WoD is adding on to that complexity in different tier models by giving the highest tier raiding a new and unique look. <br />
<br />
Garrisons is going to be a large part of your WoD gaming too. Extra bonus roll in raids? I hardly doubt raiders (non LFR) will ignore that aspect.<br />
<br />
Whether or not this is the biggest expansion we wont know until it's over but you certainly dont look at it with a clear mind. Besides, who says they've told us everything (like the tech behind network coding to make the game feel responsive)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Troll comment? I guess I should have put a disclaimer that it was a joke. I forget that people conveniently leave their sense of humor at the door as soon as they enter these forums and decide to take everything literally in hopes it will further help them in an unnecessary debate.<br />
<br />
&gt;:(<br />
<br />
But anyway. I'm not so sure that the drastic differences between raid difficulty item appearances are really an appreciated change though. Just the difference between normal and mythic is insane. Has most of the player base been asking for heroic/mythic raiders to have better looking gear than everyone else? Those people make up a fragment of the player base. I for one didn't ask for them to do more than just a recolor of each tier set for each difficulty, and I definitely didn't ask them to add a couple more gates before I get to my favorite gear set. <br />
<br />
I can't speak for the majority, but I don't think Blizzard is really concerned about the majority either judging by this new tier model.<br />
<br />
<br />
And as to the new models and stat squish in 6.0 and being part of the expansion. They've said they were going to do it for two expansions now. I'm not pleased with the fact that they decided to push it off and start it as a selling point of an expansion instead of releasing them over the course of an expansion or in a separate patch. I would think most other people wouldn't be pleased with it either, especially when it's not even guaranteed that we will get them all at launch and when they've been presumably one of the biggest development feats of the expansion as opposed to other things such as a new race, or a new class, or more dungeons, or more zones, or whatever the case may be. <br />
<br />
Either way, it's all just my opinion and you can argue as much as you'd like. I'm not going to pretend I know what goes on at Blizzard or what the development process is like, and I'm also not going to repeatedly praise them or defend them as if they're the Jesus of the gaming industry. I'm just another customer with another opinion, and found it amusing that someone said this was the largest expansion to date when I can't personally find a single thing to validate that claim.</div></div><hr />

My thoughts as well.<br />
<br />
I honestly wish they would just push the expansion back to do everything that they planned and mentioned in their Blizzcon panel. Looks like corporate is not going to let that happen. <br />
<br />
I actually agree with him on this one. People will QQ that they dont get faction hubs they expected for a little while people will QQ a lot harder and longer if the game comes out in June/July instead of this year. Plus the loss of subs is probably already high do to the lack of content. SoO will likely have been out for 13 months before WoD which is already a stretch. Imagine 20 months of SoO or longer....</div></div><hr />

And I fully understand Bashiok's point on these issues.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, faction hubs are a CORE part of the game. A place where the average WoW player spends a large % of his playtime. <br />
It HAS to be FINISHED. Not some half assed *generic town #3* shit, because that would really ruin the immersion of many players.<br />
<br />
You can avoid a lot of outposts if they look ugly, but the main capital hub is something you'll always have to return to.<br />
I hope when WoD comes out this is in tiptop shape, as Blizzard is renown for doing, because anything less just seems like a total sellout for fast cash (EA / Activision style).<br />

<br />
You know you're a fanboy when…<br />
<br />
There isn't one example in game where they have gone back to something they abandoned and then used it in a future expansion. There were walled off portals / raids in Vanilla they never implemented…the underwater raid in Cata was never developed…etc etc…<br />
<br />
the closet examples of what you are talking about are rehashes like Naxx (which required all new assets etc meaning if they did miraculously use these assets again they would be different assets) and Archeology (Path of Titans reduced to the worst, most boring &quot;profession&quot; in the game and that's coming from a guy who had max fishing on 3 toons at the end of Cata).<br />
<br />
but, the reality is that each expansion takes them basically in a new direction and what was previously left on the chopping block never sees the light of day again.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't really matter, does it? For what I've gathered, we are gonna spend most of our time in our own garrisons most likely.<br />
<br />
I do understand Bladespire is an awesome place, it really looks stunning, but I don't think Durotan would feel comfortable hosting a shit ton of people using the most ridiculous looking transmogs for 2 years, turning their comfy home into a hell of a mess (see what the alliance and horde did for the pandaren shrines). Even though it would be great to walk around the halls of Karabor with that dejavu feeling, I think that all the alliance shit they would have to add to the place would take its unique feeling away. So why not have those Ashran hubs? Most people are gonna spend their times around the island anyway.<br />
<br />
If you REALLY want Bladespire or Karabor as your home base, I'm pretty sure there will be an Inn Keeper at each location and some sort of lvl 100 quick transportation beetween these locations and the hub and the garrison.</div></div><hr />

Ok, bye.<br />

Enjoy paying that sub for no content for over a year. Hell why not make it two years of no content? Might as well, you idiots still pay for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The real question is why can't Blizzard seem to manage things so that they are releasing decent and finished xpacs in a reasonable amount of time? My wife works in software and so I know it is complicated and that herding geeks is a tough job because the very things that make them great at their jobs often also make them very hard to manage.

My guess here is that the Garrisons ended up taking a lot more art time than they originally anticipated. Perhaps original concepts were designed, even in-game, and scrapped. This seems very possible, given the fact that we were originally going to be able to pick where our Garrison would be. It's definitely possible that they had gone fairly far down that road artistically before they decided that option didn't make sense for the game (or maybe THAT would take too much art time). It's unfortunate, but I don't think we're being snowballed on this specific issue.<br />
<br />
That being said, we have plenty of reason to be frustrated. The lack of content is driving us all a bit batty.<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten to spend as much time with the alpha/beta as I'd like, but I do like what I've seen so far. That much is reassuring to me.<br />
<br />
Dear gods . . .are you playing the beta? Because if the garrisons actually took up a lot of art time then something is terribly, terribly wrong. They are extremely bland and uninspiring.<br />
<br />
I suspect that too much time was spent on some relatively minor features that are quite nice but . . .still minor. In other words: Bad project management. This is a common problem in any kind of tech development when people who have been with the company awhile are promoted into management when they are not at all gifted at that kind of work. Being a great programmer, or a great artist, or being great at any other detail-work that goes into game-making does not mean you are going to be good at managing a team of human beings and making big decisions about where the team's effort should be directed. <br />
<br />
Managing a big project takes certain skills that a lot of people do not have. Promoting people who are good at sweating the small stuff into management because they have worked at a place for eight years is a bad way to run a company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hate to break it to you, but this has happened for every Blizzard release, no matter how much they try to avoid it. Some of the better known ones: <br />
<br />
Starcraft 1: two unpolished Terran campaign missions (one of which fixes a plot hole in the Protoss campaign)<br />
Starcraft 2: Protoss and Zerg campaigns<br />
WoW the original: Aszhara and Silithus were blatantly unfinished on release, and Aszhara never got finished<br />
WotLK: Azjol Nerub zone and raid completely scrapped<br />
<br />
Diablo 3: PvP got scrapped and another difficulty was made to fill the gap. Not to mention the launch day fiasco with error 37.<br />
Cataclysm: Abyssal Maw Dungeon, originally planned to be released alongside Firelands, got scrapped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I was subbed for only 4 months of this patch. Mostly because I'm an adult and don't need my life to revolve so much around WoW that I bitch and cry and moan about how long a content drought is or how the game is bad because they changed minor thingd in the development process. <br />
<br />
But guess what? If people still are subbed it is because they actually still enjoy the game they are paying for which makes you one of those self-entitled cunts that thinks because you don't like something that it is unfathomable that other people still do.<br />
<br />
Move out of your parents basement and get some help if a game you aren't forced to pay for or play gives you such an intense anger.</div></div><hr />

Basically it comes down to they were taking so long to get WoD ready, that making decent proper, interesting cities would have pushed it back past the 20th November (or whatever) date they gave, and instead they went for a cop out, lame, boring, easy, copy pasted pile of crap instead.</div></div><hr />

3. I'm actually a casual player, not someone who has nothing to do but play WoW, lol. I just actually think a lot about things I have any interest in.<br />
4. Not everyone who has a wife is male. Welcome to the present day.<br />
5. My opinions were not expressed to make you feel bad. If you felt bad, that's on you. I didn't call you mean names or otherwise do anything provocative enough to elicit this kind of vitriol in response. I mean, seriously, if my casual conjecture on some game forum got you frothing at the mouth like this, maybe it is you who kind of need to step back and consider who is overly invested in the game, you know? EIther that or maybe get some help for your rage problem in general.<br />
<br />
My opinions, like most of those expressed in any sort of forums, are just conjecture on my part, obviously. It's what we do here. Chill. It isn't personal when we don't agree with one another.</div></div><hr />

I thought Blizz was all about quality over quantity and this move goes in the opposite direction. What's a month extra of work if it means the area would be the way players would enjoy it more?<br />
<br />
Sounds like the shareholders are starting to be the voice behind the game design. Before, they would take their time but now they seem rushed.</div></div><hr />

I don't even play World of Warcraft and his valuation seems to be at least somewhat accurate, even if fed from mostly bitterness. I gotta say, Blizzard does appear to have management issues. You can see it across all of their games, their entire company. Significant issues? I don't know. Any worse than the average company? Probably not. They've been re-working their engine again obviously, and that takes a lot of work to just add something new like Garrisons into the game. Face it, that IS the expansion. New artwork across the board, new additional animations. Testing, feeling, playing, modifying, altering, etc. Once again, time. Introducing new zones and instances. That is a lot of work to do, even for a big team. Because in the end you gotta make sure it all comes together and doesn't break every 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
That being said, management issues. I see public relations are managed horribly, and always have been. Whoever decided these are the best methods of communicating with your community, Twitter and forum lashbacks, obviously lacks some sense. The people in these positions shouldn't even really be there anymore, they've been there too long. They too are becoming bitter and unhelpful. They're creating more problems for their company then they're helping resolve, and feedback is nothing but loud noise because they have no idea how to manage it. It's a problem they don't even care to acknowledge, recognize, or even consider or think about because it's their jobs and pride on the line. And since they can't manage feedback very appropriately (thousands of good suggestions are buried in mountains of bullshit whining) and instead just fight back against all of that stupid whining with whining of their own often, the company comes off as a big joke. They don't act professional half the time, so it's really hard to give them that respect. They design their games, however they feel like most of the time because they actually literally can't handle the feedback. They ask for it, they say they listen, make no indications that they're listening except when someone says something really stupid. <br />

<br />
1. I didn't interpret anything, I'm talking about what you said, and I get to talk about what you said, because you posted what you said in a public forum. See number 5 of your post. What I need to make clear though is this: Because I posted what I posted does not make me a rager. This is clearly another attempt to SHAME anyone who disagrees with you, because you don't want to admit that possibly you have no idea what you're talking about. I assure you I am calm, and collected, and that you are in fact the more likely candidate for someone who is angry, or clearly your post would have been very different.<br />
2. You seem to be forgetting what you wrote, but here is the important part: &quot;But clearly Blizzard has some real problems at the management level and above because their dysfunction is simply obvious to anyone who isn't just an apologist for the company.&quot;<br />
3. Not sure I care.<br />
4. Not sure I care.<br />
5. My opinions were expressed to point out that you made up a whole scenario to fit your idea that the company has &quot;In other words: Bad project management&quot; when in reality, nothing is late, project is fine, forums are whining, and you're dying for more content. If my posting this causes you to &quot;froth at the mouth&quot; then maybe quit saying stupid shit. See it works both ways. You post something. I post something. You say you're not mad. I can then say I'm not mad. You shame me. I shame you back. BUT... who is the one who is actually mad? I think you need to think about this one for awhile, since you have this ability to think, as you claim.<br />
<br />
<br />
My opinions, like most of those expressed in any sort of forums, are just conjecture on my part, obviously. It's what we do here. Chill. It isn't personal when we don't agree with one another.I am not taking it personally, I promise you. Still you can't stop me from posting. &lt;3<br />

I'm sorry, but what ARE we supposed to think of you then?And this post went past the extra mile, and into extreme whine mode. Wow.<br />
<br />
None of what you said is true, but here is something that is true: Blizzard makes computer games for kids, and they always take their time, and they always have huge hits. Serious business. Guys. You. Are. Hilarious.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean fuck, they've had 10 years to implement a simple FEEDBACK forum. Separate all their games, and their variety of features so people can specifically comment on specific issues without getting buried in a mountain of tripe.

Unless it's a game-breaking bug, they don't care. And unless they ever want to start designing games for their communities instead of themselves, then I don't care either.Well, I doubt they want your fair and balanced feedback. But I'll try to help you out with a little knowledge. They get feedback, just not from forums anymore. The players made it that way. Why, because posters just say stuff to get what they want. They will say ANYTHING... to get what they want. That is bullshit and you know it. If you really have some valuable feedback that they can't live without, then send them an email. The forums should be for discussion anyways, not &quot;Blizzard fails again, to give me what I wanted&quot;.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Stupid&quot; is subjective. Player feedback gets boring when the same moot points are getting thrown at you over and over again. I feel bad for the devs and CM's, they should just stop responding to anything about the cities, its obvious that the only answer whiners will be happy with is &quot;Okay, we'll spend some extra time modelling, texturing and populating new cities&quot; - no winning for Blizzard, so they have to just stay quiet and wait for people to get bored of whining.<br />
<br />
So because you accept less we should too? that right?<br />
<br />
If they would give an answer the questions may just stop. As it is and was all they did was say &quot;here, /rage&quot;. <br />
<br />
And could possibly be so hard about adding npcs, some music, portals, bank, and god knows what else to a city? They've done it a hundred times now. You'd think they had the tools to automate some of it.<br />
<br />
What bash really wanted to say was &quot;the ROI wasn't enough so we threw in these corney bases for you because ROI &gt; players wants and expectations&quot;.<br />
<br />
Can't blame them for being a publicly traded co. but can blame them for being so slow and inefficient.<br />

Amazing patience shown by the people answering questions at blizzard. <br />
I would flip the fuck out on a daily basis reading these amont of mouth breathing butthurt from self-entitled brats all day everyday. <br />
Great work, you da real mvps!<br />
<br />
Queue the floods of QQing!<br />
<br />
More proof why blizzard is more and more minimalist, corny, and cheap. People like this will take whatever is thrown at them. It's not entitlement to expect more for your money. Go ahead expect less and here you are getting less and less every day.<br />

Just check out the reviews on glassdoor.com: http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Blizzard-Entertainment-Reviews-E24858.htm<br />
<br />
A common thread seems to be a lack of strong management, no room for advancement or advancement unfarily rewarded, and lower than average pay.<br />
<br />
wow some of those reviews are just sad. It's clear some of the old heads and the creators of the good games of the past all left because of the politics and idiots they had to work with. <br />
<br />
The idea that blizzard is great any more are pretty much put to rest in my mind. They suck.</div></div><hr />

No, I never said you should accept less because I do. I don't care about the cities being moved that much, it would be nice to have them as planned but I am not going to question the Blizzard CM's constantly on their decisions and in some cases come up with lies to make them seem like the devil. And plopping down npc's here and there doesn't create a good looking city. Private servers do that, and they all look shitty.<br />
<br />
And yes, I don't blame Blizzard if they decided that human/orc bases are better both for gameplay &amp; world pvp on pvp servers (Cities next to eachother), and just generally a better ROI than creating a horde and alliance city completely separate to eachother.<br />
<br />
There are bigger faults in the game that people should care about. Here's hoping the people who are getting extremely upset over this are the ones to leave, they are likely the ones who fund the cash shop mounts and have a panic attack when they get killed by another player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true. I know company reps have a vested interest in not being disrespectful, but it surely helps their case. When I read the tweets from the public, all I think is that they are complete jerks, and I have a difficult time agreeing with their points.</div></div><hr />
