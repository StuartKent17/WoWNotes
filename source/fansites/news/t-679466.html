Icecrown Citadel testing has been progressing very well over the last few weeks, and this has been a huge help to the encounter design team. We want to thank everyone who has logged onto the PTR and tried the encounters there.<br />
<br />
As we're now getting closer to the release of 3.3.0, we wanted to talk about our plans for access progression within Icecrown Citadel. Icecrown Citadel is going to be broken up into four distinct sections: The Lower Spire, Plagueworks, Crimson Hall, and Frostwing Halls. We plan on releasing these four sections of Icecrown Citadel over time and not all immediately when patch 3.3.0 goes live. At this point we can't give precise dates for these release dates as they are determined by when patch 3.3.0 goes live. Once dates are known with more certainty, I'll update the community so they can plan appropriately.<br />
<br />
The first section that opens will include the Lord Marrowgar, Lady Deathwhisper, Icecrown Gunship Battle, and Deathbringer Saurfang encounters. Progress beyond that point will be prevented for several weeks. Then the Plagueworks will open with Rotface, Festergut, and Professor Putricide becoming available. After another period of time, the Crimson Hall will open and you can then fight the Blood Princes and Blood-Queen Lana'thel. The final Frostwing Halls unlock then occurs after that, making Valithria Dreamwalker, Sindragosa, and the Lich King available. We believe a staggered release of the content will allow players to experience Icecrown Citadel at a sustainable, measured, and ultimately more enjoyable pace.<br />
<br />
There are other elements that gate access along the way. Players may not attempt any Heroic versions of 10 player encounters until they have defeated the Lich King in a 10 player raid. Similarly, players must defeat the Lich King in a 25 player raid before they can attempt a Heroic 25 player encounter. So players must master every normal difficulty encounter in Icecrown Citadel before attempting Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
The Lich King may not be attempted until Professor Putricide, Blood-Queen Lana'thel, and Sindragosa are defeated. Furthermore, the Heroic difficulty of The Lich King encounter may not be attempted in any week unless the three aforementioned encounters have been defeated in Heroic difficulty that week.<br />
<br />
The Ashen Verdict provides reinforcements and material for players to assault Icecrown Citadel, but this support is not endless. Raids will have a limited number of attempts total each week to defeat the four most difficult encounters in Icecrown Citadel: Professor Putricide, Blood-Queen Lana'thel, Sindragosa, and the Lich King. As these boss encounters are unlocked, the number of attempts available per week will increase. The initial number of attempts provided for defeating Professor Putricide is only five. When Blood-Queen Lana'thel unlocks, the amount of total attempts remaining will increase to 10. Then when Sindragosa and the Lich King unlock, 15 total attempts will be available to defeat all four bosses. After a raid has exhausted their attempts for the week, the Ashen Verdict must withdraw their support and the four most difficult bosses all despawn and become unavailable for the week. The limited attempt system is a feature of both Normal and Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
There will be no explicit rewards for defeating the Lich King with a specific number of attempts remaining as there was with Trial of the Grand Crusader. There will also not be an achievement to complete Icecrown Citadel without being defeated by a boss encounter, or letting a raid member die. (i.e. A Tribute to Insanity).<br />
<br />
In the weeks and months after all twelve encounters are unlocked, additional attempts against the final four boss encounters become available. This represents the Ashen Verdict growing more powerful and gaining a stronger foothold in Icecrown Citadel. To further help raids, Varian Wrynn and Garrosh Hellscream will begin to provide assistance by inspiring the armies attacking Icecrown Citadel. This is represented as an additional zone wide spell effect applied to all players that will increase their hit points, damage dealt, and healing done. This effect will also increase in effectiveness over time. Players may opt out of the spell's effect if they so wish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: For you people that can't read properly, it said &quot;% attempts per last boss of each wing at the start&quot;. That's 5 for each boss when they become available.<br />
<br />
It then says <br />
<br />
In the weeks and months after all twelve encounters are unlocked, additional attempts against the final four boss encounters become available.<br />

so, the whole point of the limitations is just to... limit? so people don't trample through heroic content in 1 week?<br />

Several weeks is extremely gay. The weekly gate openings are a decent system but 2+ weeks between gates of 3-4 bosses seems like a way to stretch out content length going towards the expansion rather than to add an &quot;epic feel&quot; to the dungeon.<br />
<br />
I do however greatly like the limited number of attempts thing rather than 50 in ToGC.</div></div><hr />

Alot of those cooldowns have been reduced in timers. I doubt you will be waiting around &quot; THAT &quot; long for another try.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sinister Knight</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is excellent. Expect massive QQ from Ensidia and...well, I guess Ensidia (read Kungen) are going to be the only ones bitching about this. Too freaking bad. This leashing system for progression is excellent, I really have gotten tired of the top guilds blasting through the content after extensive PTR testing, then whining about how it was too easy, or they bash their heads against it and either find a bug to win or bitch that it's overtuned until it's nerfed, blah blah blah. The restricted attempts is great, which means top guilds with great coordiation will have a challenge but it won't be overly difficult, and casual guilds will have to wait a long time before they get the support (aka raid buff) that they need to finish it themselves. The requirement of beating the whole thing on regular before even attempting heroic is also a good way to go as it keeps the progression linear. <br />
<br />
@ Kalx: You think it's not comforting that people can't trample through it in one week? That's rather silly. <br />
<br />
@Abb: Nope they may not like it, but they really don't have a choice now do they? *grin* Besides, most of the bosses are already being tested by the top guilds in the PTR, so they're going to have strategies already in place, I don't think the 5 attempts is going to slow them down very much. Either that or it means they're going to have to crack down on their weaker/slower/dumber raid member even more, which is a win regardless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you cant do that.. but if you do then we limit that, and even if you get past that then your no longer able to do this and then finally when you get to this bit.. well we stop you finishing that as well.. Finally when 12 of your earth years have passed we may let you look at the Lich Kings Toe!!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zaneosak</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What a sad way to make Icecrown Citadel last until Cataclysm release. My 10 man group has been sitting in toc/togc for months bored as hell and you're telling me we're only going to be able to kill four bosses the week ICC comes out and YOU KNOW they are going to be easy as shit, they said let all casuals see the content on normal modes. Some of us REALLY excited for new content, why can't you just let us play it at our own pace, and just make the encounters CHALLENGING like it should be, its Icecrown Citadel not Deadmines.<br />
<br />
Such epic fail. If you're going to LIMIT attempts at least reward PERFECTION... Making it easier with that buff is just kinda lame, you're gonna get discredited if you missed a week cuz of attendance or something didnt clear the hardest modes &quot;pre-song of battle&quot;<br />
<br />
On a side note, I do like the fact that to attack arthas on heroic mode, you will really have to be on your a-game and beat Putricide, Lanathel and Sindragosa on heroic mode to attempt Arthas on heroic mode, but in a way its kinda lame depending on the encounters. Imagine having to do Firefighter and Knockx3 every time you wanted to try algalon.<br />
<br />
A great finishing touch to this shit sundae is if Blizzard makes the Heroic Modes like ToC and just increase hp / dmg and not add new mechanics or make anything unique about them. <br />
<br />
Disappointing for the people who really are ready for some new raid content :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
My issue with # of attempts stuff isn't a matter of difficulty, though I admit my guild is especially vulnerable to it (we're a silly bunch), but this whole annoying stress on every attempt / oh god wait for rezzes / is lust up / oh boy soulstones / oh god someone disconnected shit makes content either stupid or frankly covers for bad design. It's just a less enjoyable way to play the game.<br />
<br />
But, anyway, I guess this means cataclysm is much further behind schedule than people had hoped. Not to say I'm quitting, but I think this might be the point where I actually drop sub and pool game cards til Cata. Sigh.</div></div><hr />

Ok, so it's gonna be a bit frustrating knowing that there is content 'out there' that you just can't touch, but clearly Blizz are having to turn a lot of attention to Cata and we're gonna be high and dry for a few months with no new patches. This is basically a way of turning one patch into 3 and, personally, I think I'm going to appreciate having more content to look forward to.<br />

top guild will have to wait for next boss to be implemented<br />
casual will have to wait for respawn of last boss because they wiped a lot.<br />

if even normal modes have lots of limits it will be really hard to make a raid planing.<br />
<br />
it's already hard for some little guilds, but now we can't try something with a little team, cause the good players of the guild are needed to do the last boss, and there wont be some attempt left when these guys will be online...<br />
so need to wait for them, and perhaps lots a day or two, or try and lost a chance to go to the last boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What's actually going to happen is you'll see pugs blasting through the content complaining how easy it is too. It does *not* take a top raiding guild to make it through an instance in a couple of weeks after release. My guild killed twins hardmode for the first time last week, and each boss in toc easy died on Tuesday each week it was released. All this means is you will have more gear creep, which means guilds who go to the second wing will have several weeks of wing one gear under their belt, likely trivializing most of the new bosses.<br />
<br />
Gated system does not make it harder, all it does it make the instance easier and more boring. Expect to see *way* more qq about how easy icecrown is compared to ulduar and toc. It won't even have hardmodes for months.</div></div><hr />

you do know that cataclysm is still a ways off right? this has got to last you at least until then. if they gave you all unlimited tries each week, and left the raid un-gated you guys would fly though it in a month, and then start complaining that you don't have anything to do until cataclysm comes out.<br />
<br />
to put it simply. you guys are all fat kids, and blizzard is the parent with the cake. YOU WANT THE CAKE BAD! but blizzard knows that if they give you the whole cake you will just inhale it in one bite, and likely have another stroke. so they are being the responsible parents that they are, and are letting you have one slice after you finish your green beans.</div></div><hr />

^this<br />
<br />
This may be the worst thing blizzard has ever implemented for a raid... No hardmodes for 2-3 months? And when we finally get hardmodes we have FIVE attempts per week for the actual hard bosses? This must be a cruel joke... Why can't we have a proper race again? It takes all of the fun away from following WoW<br />
<br />
This isn't QQ from a hardcore perspective, this is QQ from a rational, casual player. It doesn't take a hardcore to wtfpwn normal modes and be 4/5 or even 5/5 in ToGC... this is a major let down in what could have been an awesome instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only good things are:<br />
- need to defeat lich king on normal mode before you can unlock hardmodes<br />
- limited ammount of attempts for the final 4 bosses of the instance<br />
<br />
the bad things: simply the rest... the number of attempts on normal mode for the final 4 bosses and the delay of content for several weeks are simply the worse part.<br />
<br />
I enjoy raiding, i could live with sunwell's gate system, i could live with TOC because it was yust a filler content that needed to drag out but the final instance with a system like this will definately make it less epic.</div></div><hr />

Oh, it wasn't constant. I took breaks every so often to keep my sanity and stay in shape.<br />

There were even worse people on my server. Top guild at the time, used to go 6 days and would actually have people on call (phone numbers and shit) when they needed backup. And know what? These people stopped whatever they were doing (provided it was plausible) and played.<br />
<br />
I regret spending 5-6 nights a week. It's nice that I can do other things while still seeing content and keeping current with the crowd.<br />

<br />
maybe blizzard has a desire to have players see the 5 man content they created and have that actually be worthwhile to raiders as well as more casual players?<br />
<br />
ive always wanted this game to have a 2 day MAX raiding need, there are other days of the week you can do OTHER things in game and out. this, at first, can artificially create a 2 day raiding schedule (togc, 25 and 10 after first 4 bosses normal icc and maybe an ony in there for measure can all be done in one night by seasoned guilds). then once you become better and better and (and the buff builds for the bosses you have on farm to make them even easier) you can spend the same amount of time and forget about togc 25 and 10.<br />
<br />
then you have 5 nights to... hang out with friends... learn to knit.... apply for jobs... level jewelcrafting.... grief lowbies, whatever.<br />

<br />
Honestly from a upper progressed guild this is a let down - its not because the limited ammount of tries, or the gated system. Its because we have to wait. Sounds like what in reality is this: Blizzard doesn't have there crap in order and wants to retain players while they spend the next 4 weeks after releasing the instance, designing the last half of it and fixing bugs.<br />
<br />
As to all those scrubs who have a knife out for the hardcore guilds, Pfff. All this does is ensure that the hardcore players that are in successful guilds have more geared alts that are higher GEARSCORE then yours. Get over it, and to the claims of the QQ HC Guilds QQ about easy content and wanting more gear. They finished there food and will likely finish it again before you even get to your mashed potatoes so shut up an eat.</div></div><hr />

It's tailored to more Hardcore Guilds, which I support (although I'm not a part of a seriously hardcore guild), but it seems like it's a built-in type of tuning. The buff that the Ashen Verdict will give will eventually make pugging super easy, no? I'm sure it will top out at a certain point, but we'll see. I do think that the attempt cap hurts Guilds that don't participate on the PTR, as most top-tier will have already seen the fights (to an extent of course).<br />
<br />
I agree that it will make Guilds respect honest attempts. Will have to adjust for Soulstone'less attempts, people who love pulling Threat, survivability, etc. <br />

<br />
to put it simply. you guys are all fat kids, and blizzard is the parent with the cake. YOU WANT THE CAKE BAD! but blizzard knows that if they give you the whole cake you will just inhale it in one bite, and likely have another stroke. so they are being the responsible parents that they are, and are letting you have one slice after you finish your green beans.<br />

Why should they re-activate on day one of this patch ? The patch barely brings any new content on day one.

Of course, but the whole concept of limited attempts doesn't always mean artificially increasing difficulty. It just means you can't spend 5 hours on one boss.</div></div><hr />

As for the limited attempts, it is ONLY for the final boss of each wing, a la four horsemen, Maexxena, Loatheb, and Thaddius. I'm guessing that these bosses are going to be quite difficult, but the others getting up to them will be easy. Since the wings don't SOUND like they're sequential (if they are, it's stupid), you can skip from wing to wing. Again with the Naxx reference, if you use up your attempts on four horsemen, you can still go clear patchwerk, grobbulus and gluth, just not thaddius.</div></div><hr />

Much better solution than the &quot;you have to do this or that to activate said hardmode in Uld crap&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd also like to know how many posters here complaining about this have actually done any of the ICC encounters on the PTR. Or are they just going by what they've heard from others?<br />
<br />
To those using the &quot;this is LKs last raid before Cata&quot; card to support their disapproval of this system I can use that card to. Since this is the last major raid of Lich King don't ya think they wanted to make it especially epic feeling? What's so epic about staying up all night in order to clear the raid in one go just so you can stroke your e-peen on some pointless world first crap?</div></div><hr />

<br />
My thoughts on this idea is that it's BS. They're limiting attempts, bad enough, but the fact that they aren't rewarding people for not wiping is bullshit. I pushed people in TotGC10 to get Insanity. Not for the rewards, not for the achievements, but to say &quot;We're better than the average guild, let's show what we can do&quot;. Now, they're taking that away from us in ICC. What is there left to &quot;prove&quot; after we kill the LK?<br />
<br />
It's bad enough they called TotC an instance, and Faction Champions an encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
I recall a blue post saying: &quot;Arthas Hard Mode says hi&quot;. I could be paraphrasing that...<br />
<br />
Besides, it means you just need to push people to not mess around. Oh, and your reward for not wiping is loot. Maybe an achievement depending on what boss/bosses you kill. Or say other things. Besides, you also have to take into account Icewell Radiance. So...<br />
<br />
Just simply be thankful its not going to be as easy as ToC.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree... Seriously, cut the crap about this nolifer 5 nights a week, 4 hours a night. You can clear the hardest raid in the game in less than an hour, and still have time to go wtfpwn all of Ulduar hardmodes in the same night. This is getting very silly...</div></div><hr />

The amount of pressure and hate directed at directed at a single person causing a wipe, whether through stupidity, lag or disconnect is going to create a lot of tension and grief.<br />
<br />
I would suggest the following:<br />
<br />
Limited tries for hardmode only, so if you fail you can at least finish up and improve the guild's gear as a whole even if you miss out on Arthas.<br />
More tries. 1st week with 5 tries is going to cause some grief quits when 1 person costs the guild 20% of their attempts.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard itself is still under the control of Mike Morhaime. What makes you think anyone from the parent company has any say in how Blizzard designs their content?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rambaral</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It also sounds like a way to get 3.3 out earlier, since it's possible they may still do a little work on the latter part of the raid while the first bit is live. I'd rather be able to start enjoying the content this year and work on the first part of it instead of sitting on my alts waiting for 3.3 some time in February.<br />
<br />
It's also likely to be equal to an average raiding guilds progression, so it may be transparent to a guild that would likely not be up to the 4th or 5th boss in a few weeks anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
4 wings. Each wing not getting unlocked &quot;for several weeks (wtf)&quot; means we won't even see Arthas on Normal until like 3 months AFTER the patch comes out. Also it means anyone who is picked to get Shadowmourn for their guild won't be getting it for like at LEAST 6+ months from now if you calculate the 1000 mobs that need to be kill'd after you kill the bosses (which will be locked) AND also get the fragments needed. <br />
<br />

Alot of guilds are going to end up running into a wall on one boss and being simply unable to progress, trying new things could lock them out for that week and basically screw them over. The attempt limit was fine for ToGC, I don't really see why it needed to be put into normal modes aswell. Not every guild has people that are as on the ball as the hard mode raiding guilds, and this will cause more frustration than ToC did boredom. <br />
<br />
I generally hate the 'gating content' model though, it's basically forcing you to wait around for the rest of the content so that you're bled more money. If the instance is quality, set it up like Ulduar, most everyone loved Ulduar and still run it regularly. If they're just trying to stall until Cataclysm is launched next year sometime this is a really poor way to go about it.</div></div><hr />

My guild has 4/5 bosses on farm status in heroic trial of the grand crusader. But we also go to Ulduar 25 man to do some hard modes and achievements there.

Gating is useless, people can take whatever time they need to master encounter. This isn't a justification for preventing &quot;better&quot; guilds to progress faster. Other guilds will just take more time to get to Lich King, just like what happened in Uld and any other raid that made sense.<br />
<br />
Plus we're locked out of Heroic for so f'ing long. My guild does 25's and 10 Heroic was a nice alternate way to get more gear at first, but now we'll wait for who knows how long cause they're too dumb to release the whole raid at once.<br />

All this means is you will have more gear creep, which means guilds who go to the second wing will have several weeks of wing one gear under their belt, likely trivializing most of the new bosses.<br />

Gated system does not make it harder, all it does it make the instance easier and more boring. Expect to see *way* more qq about how easy icecrown is compared to ulduar and toc. It won't even have hardmodes for months.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never said gating would make things harder. And I will laugh if pugs (true pugs, random people picked up in trade channel) are &quot;blasting&quot; through the content in the first few weeks. I really will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This may be the worst thing blizzard has ever implemented for a raid... No hardmodes for 2-3 months? And when we finally get hardmodes we have FIVE attempts per week for the actual hard bosses? This must be a cruel joke... Why can't we have a proper race again? It takes all of the fun away from following WoW<br />
The hardcore raiding guilds initially complained that raiding was too easy, after blasting through the content in weeks. Now that they can't race through it wearing diapers and living off Red Bull, and have a gated system restricting how fast they can progress.. they complain it will take too long. Sometimes you can't win for trying.<br />
<br />
As for the attempts; I think you missed the two significant notes about it:<br />
1) Unlocking more bosses = more attempts possible.<br />
2) As time progresses more attempts will be made possible per week.<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't QQ from a hardcore perspective, this is QQ from a rational, casual player. It doesn't take a hardcore to wtfpwn normal modes and be 4/5 or even 5/5 in ToGC... this is a major let down in what could have been an awesome instance.<br />
Not really. As a casual, it will hardly affect you since that you can do all the normal modes, then do the heroic mode for that same wing after. Voila. And if you're so casual that you can clear 4 wings of a raid on hardmode out of the box, then my understanding of what 'casual' means must be way off base.</div></div><hr />

Either way, they're giving us the same content.<br />
You're just saying they should spread it out. That wouldn't mean they're doing any more work as a developer.<br />
They're just giving us a MASSIVE content patch with plenty to do, and enough time to do it all before Cata comes out. The hardcore players have a chance to achieve lvl 80 perfection, and the casuals can pug heroics and get emblem gear so they can pug ICC 10 and 25 and down the Lich King eventually. Everybody gets the time to do exactly what they want. <br />
<br />
As for the limited attempts, at least it doesn't limit attempts on EVERY boss. Only the hardest boss in each individual section. So it doesn't lock you out from TOO much loot if you use up all your attempts</div></div><hr />

You're assuming he has ANY say in what Blizzard does by assuming this system is to &quot;milk&quot; players for their money and he's behind it. It certainly isn't stealing when every WoW player bought the game and subscribed out of their own free will.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is a business yes but do you believe every Blizzard employee is only in it for money? Money they have. Subscription numbers in the millions they have. The best of the best employees who love what they do they have.<br />
<br />
A lot of people stick with a crappy job because they need the money to live but Blizzard doesn't operate that way. These people love the game as much or more than we do - they just can't always give players what they want. Their reasons may not always be clear but I'm sure they do have them.<br />
<br />

A lot of people are happy with this change. Read all the posts.<br />
Blizzard employees are gamers too ya know. But they also know they can't give everyone everything they want. Think of it like a parent and their child. Just because the child wants a cookie before dinner doesn't mean they should get it. It's up to the parent to decide what's right and wrong and in the best interest of the child.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The last 3 paragraphs however... wow. Not only do we get stuck with a gated system to hold back raiders but we also get miniscule attempt limits slapped on as well?<br />
<br />
Gates and Attempt limits do not make a raid more difficult for hardcore raiders, it just annoys EVERYONE.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I can understand the need/want for a gated system on Blizzards end, they dont want us to complete icecrown in the first day, but i really dont think they see why its not fun for any mid level raider and up. For most guilds each gate will only take a day or two to complete leaving the raiders having to go back to previous content to fill in raid days. In sunwell and ToC it wasnt all that bad as most guilds still had reason to go back to the previous raid tier thus filling up a raid week... however at this point its completely different with the size/difficulty of ToC. ToC only has 5 bosses, is a complete joke on normal, is a complete joke on heroic up till anub, not to mention anub is an incredibly boring fight and we will all most likely be full up on gear minus the few random items that never seem to drop. I just figured that they made 3.2 so miniscule because they wanted to pimp out icecrown... but its starting to look like that isnt the case.<br />
<br />
As a raider i raid 5 nights a week, its what i enjoy in wow and thus is the only reason i choose to log into the game, i personally dont enjoy anything else. This kind of gated and attempt limit system is what ruins the only fun i find in wow. I surely know not everyone feels the same as me but i personally do not enjoy having the amount of content i can experience at a time being segmented by gates yet to be opened simply to keep the top handful of guilds in the world from clearing an instance in a matter of hours. I could however live with this inconvenience if there was other content to do, sadly ToC is already cleared in a single night by most guilds leaving us nothing to do but go outside. <br />
<br />
The attempt limit system (and algalon hour) is even more infuriating. I can understand the theory behind it, those who learn fast progress, those who cannot will not gain access, it sounds good on paper but sadly wow is an online game. Being punished for something you have no controll over is the wrong way to design a raid instance. Having players internet disconnect and cause a wipe is something that cannot be predicted, buggy encounters (hi gormok the disconnector) wasting precious attempts, server problems and all the other glorious random things that happen now and then actually determine if you can even engage a boss that week rather than simply cause your raid to run back is ludicrous. These things happen and waste attempts all the time and we live it with, its unavoidable most of the time and can be quite hilarious every now and then. The fact that nomatter how skilled we are we could still have something unfortunate and unavoidable happen and lock out our raid week is just plain wrong. Having an entire raids fate rely in the hands of the unknown is a great feeling. Thats not to say its going to happen every attempt and ruin everything, but you see what im saying, having something random just be random is ok, but limited attempts makes randomness into the premature end to your raid week.<br />
<br />
The worst part is that they say &quot;several weeks&quot; between gates being opened... 1 boss/gate per week was annoying... but now we will have to wait &quot;several&quot; weeks between gates being opened? We will actually have to go outside after we clear the current progression bosses in a single night and find something else to do for the rest of the week. I surely hope &quot;several&quot; turns into &quot;each week&quot;, 3-4 weeks between new bosses would just make it obvious they have nothing else planned between now and Cata and want to string us along.<br />
<br />
They could certainly overtune the bosses to be insanely difficult but lets be realistic, ToC was easier than ulduar and they seem to want to make &quot;normal&quot; modes be childs play so they can let everyone see everything. Hopefully im wrong but right now it just seems to be a huge mash of everything annoying from previous raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, you get limited attempts on the last bosses of the 3 final wings + Arthas.<br />
<br />
If you run out of attempts on one of those guys you still have all the other (non final) bosses in each wing to kill.<br />
<br />
You gain more attempts over time, (read each week you'll probably gain 2 or 3 more tries) So in a couple months you will have 20+ attempts plus raid buffs + better gear.<br />
<br />
The only thing this hurts is the PUG community. But since blizz is putting a stronger emphasis on guild leveling in Cata, this kind of 'bring who you know and your A-Game' progression is what is needed. This will weed out the bads and force people to find guilds and learn to work together. <br />
<br />
More time for alts is a good thing imo.<br />
<br />
Personally I wish they would tie in the opening of gates to dailies like they did with Sunwell and make it into a server event when a new wing opened.<br />
<br />
And those saying they won't have shit to do in this game: <br />
<br />
You'll have time to do other stuff in the game instead of raiding. In the last week I've made 10,000 gold just having fun with the auction house and finding neat isolated places to farm for 90 minutes at a time. Things I didn't have time for when I was raiding 5 nights a week. Work on achievements, do Ulduar hardmodes. OS 3D. Naxx Undying. 40 exalted reps. Find ways to challenge yourself!</div></div><hr />

Casual doesn't mean bad, man. Casual means you have less time to spend on the game than others, I can believe there are guilds with ToGC25 cleared as casual guilds. Gear is a non-issue as Blizzard has thrown it at us in this expansion, so assuming people know how to press 4 buttons on any class DPS/Tanking/Healing isn't an issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Casual Triumph badge farming with the new system leading to..<br />
<br />
2) Easy killing of the normal mode ICC even by casual standards thus boring even casual (epic in its own right)<br />
<br />
3) Being so tired of ICC front encounters, that when you finally make it to Arthas, you're like, finally, can we just get this over with, I'm tired and wanna go to bed...<br />
<br />
Honestly, for [us] endgamers, (and I can fully understand and even I side with casual access) there is nothing to strive for save, &quot;finish this quest-line&quot;. I agree and think everyone needs to have access to every fight. But if there is no reason to achieve a perfect clear etc, then honestly Blizz, your just truly saying to endgame guilds that try hard to be the best they can, &quot;Sorry guys, sit this one out till Cataclysm&quot;<br />
<br />
The only accomplishment I ever felt in ToC was clearing it with 50 left. We don't even get that in ICC. Sorry, but I honestly do feel disappointed. (it took that blue post to make me post my 2nd time ever on MMO)</div></div><hr />

&quot;Raids will have a limited number of attempts total each week to defeat the four most difficult encounters in Icecrown Citadel: Professor Putricide, Blood-Queen Lana'thel, Sindragosa, and the Lich King&quot;<br />

<br />
First, you get limited attempts on the last bosses of the 3 final wings + Arthas.<br />
<br />
If you run out of attempts on one of those guys you still have all the other (non final) bosses in each wing to kill.<br />
<br />
You gain more attempts over time, (read each week you'll probably gain 2 or 3 more tries) So in a couple months you will have 20+ attempts plus raid buffs + better gear.<br />
<br />
The only thing this hurts is the PUG community. But since blizz is putting a stronger emphasis on guild leveling in Cata, this kind of 'bring who you know and your A-Game' progression is what is needed. This will weed out the bads and force people to find guilds and learn to work together. <br />
<br />
More time for alts is a good thing imo.<br />
<br />
Personally I wish they would tie in the opening of gates to dailies like they did with Sunwell and make it into a server event when a new wing opened.<br />
<br />
And those saying they won't have shit to do in this game: <br />
<br />
You'll have time to do other stuff in the game instead of raiding. In the last week I've made 10,000 gold just having fun with the auction house and finding neat isolated places to farm for 90 minutes at a time. Things I didn't have time for when I was raiding 5 nights a week. Work on achievements, do Ulduar hardmodes. OS 3D. Naxx Undying. 40 exalted reps. Find ways to challenge yourself! <br />
<br />
<br />
How can they make it challenging when you only have 5 attempts per week on the boss?<br />
<br />
That sounds to me more like they're limiting the challenge of the fight, because if it's too hard, people'll blow through the attempts week after week, get frustrated, post tons of whining, and cause Blizzard to nerf the fight.<br />
<br />
Artificial limitations on attempts, especially when coupled with existent disconnect bugs (we still have players, for example, that disconnect every time when Thorim is pulled, or at certain points in Anub'arak and Onyxia) is not a good way of promoting challenge and urgency.<br />
<br />
Good way of promoting challenge and urgency are things like hard modes and speed kills. The limited attempts mechanic is just rife with ways that players can be screwed by things completely out of their control, such as latency and disconnects.</div></div><hr />

Never said casual was bad, man. Like I said, I want to see proof of guild that consider themselves casual that have Anub 25 GC down. <br />
<br />
If people actually stopped to realize just how fast time flies, the gating thing isn't going to be an issue for very long at all. Hardcore progression guilds will still get their &quot;firsts&quot; in because they'll be the first ones to figure out the proper strategies+have the right people to no screw up, best connections, all that stuff. Slower guilds will progress slower, it all really will not matter in 3 weeks and you know what, those 3 weeks will fly by before you know it anyway. Just look at ToC, it's already been cleared, hardmodes have already been completed.<br />
<br />
It really is not going to be nearly as bad as people QQ it is. And if you really are sitting at your computer whining about waiting for the next wing to open via the gating instead of doing something constructive with your life, you really ought to rethink your current situation and future. You just make yourself look like an idiot and a bitch QQing on a forum about something that isn't even out yet.</div></div><hr />

It basically allows people to get the appropriate gear before moving on, well at least a bit. It does spread the content over time, but really... who wants the content cleared straight away in a week. It gives you something to look forward to, which no doubt is what blizzard wants, but im pretty sure its got to be what you want aswell. Nothing to look forward to = game quit (loss for both sides). <br />
<br />
It definately seems more thought out than the other previous waiting systems, as if its actually been thought out, though alot of you are insistent that any system like this is intended as a kick in the face to the hardcore guilds. It is in fact doing a favour for the hardcore guilds, they are not going to have to wait up all night for the patch to release, just to be lagged out by everyone trying to log in. Ofc this may happen on the week when the hardmodes can be started, but it willl be less pronounced as it is only hardcore raiders desperate to log in. The system allows heroics - which are really what the race is going to be about - to be released all at once. With everyone who want to compete being prepared for it. And have a real race.<br />
Ofc the 5 attempts system doesnt sound great, but it provides a challenge and causes guilds who try and get through by just attempting fights over and over again until they get it right by force, to step back and think about the fights a little...<br />
<br />
People need to stop finding faults and think of the good points, blizzard are really just trying to make a better game, this reallly isnt going to get complaints from the majority. And dont try and suggest us forum goers are the majority... (oh and dont try and suggest we are all the most hardcore raiders as pretty much everyone acts (also dont try and make the point that you are a hardcore raider, way to be annoying))<br />
<br />
(additionally some people seem to have forgotten that all the buffs that are going to be applied as the time passes, are entirely OPTIONAL, thus you see blizzard learning from their mistakes... well until actual nerfs come along but there should be less)<br />
<br />
All I see here is blizzards design getting better as time goes on.</div></div><hr />

A year ago I would have raged about this announcement. Now I love it. I would have gotten super stressed if we needed to raid 22 hours a week in 25 man to clear as much as possible and then do the same on 10 man on weekend just to keep our server ranking and reputation.</div></div><hr />

If they love this game let them play. Everywhere in life you're better if you take more time to improve your skills/knowledge etc. If they have fun playing 10h+ a day and 7 days a week where's the problem? We're generation INTERNET, many persons play with friends, just chat etc. It's life after all. Forget word combinations like real life, everything you do IS real. You really think its better to chill around with your friend at 6PM and drink bear or do shit? What's up with all of you? Let people live their damn life how they prefer to live it. It does not have to be your business. Not anyone is interested in being a playboy like you who has a life (can't say this with a serious face ::)). And to give an example. I am chilling in WoW often, online every day of the week. But i also go dance an club a little bit on monday , thursday and saturday. If some one does not like clubbing or chilling with friend in a shopping center ,like you definitely do, why the hell do you have to QQ about them? Wtf is up with you?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some things people should realize:<br />
1 - This 5+ attempt rule only applies to certain bosses. You can wipe as many times as you want at, say, Lord Marrowgar and the Gunship fight.<br />
2 - Raid leaders can switch raid difficulties between fights. If you wipe 3-4 times on one of these bosses, switch to Regular mode to clear him. On the next limited boss, you can switch back to Heroic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The hardcore raiding guilds initially complained that raiding was too easy, after blasting through the content in weeks. Now that they can't race through it wearing diapers and living off Red Bull, and have a gated system restricting how fast they can progress.. they complain it will take too long. Sometimes you can't win for trying.<br />
<br />
You can, but Blizzard isn't prepared to implement it for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
The content is too easy? Then it should be made harder. We all know (and some of us utterly HATE) that Blizzard eventually nerfs everything to the utter ground so that people who are bad at the game (whether Hardcore or Casual) get to see everything. I don't mean &quot;you failed at Vezax once and wiped the raid&quot; bad; I mean &quot;You jumped in and out of the fires on Shade of Aran for 3 months after the raid leader personally told you before every attempt not to do it&quot; bad.<br />
<br />
The content takes too long? That's because Blizzard is artificially making the content last long Because It Isn't Difficult Or Challenging Enough To Last That Long Against Extremely Hardcore Players. This is a fault of their design, nothing else.<br />
<br />
Content should be made much harder so that cockblock situations (gates, resistance gear specific fights, restricted number of attempts) are not necessary.<br />
<br />
In short: Make it less forgiving and keep luck to a minimum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5 attempts the first week. When the next wing opens you get 10 attempts total. Then when the third wing opens you have 15. By the time the third wing opens Putricide will be easy, and you will still have 15 attempts for the other 2.<br />
<br />
It's seriously incentive to learn the fights and not dick around. If it makes you feel better, then think of it as perma death if you fail too many times. Oh sorry, no loot this week. Try harder next time! Hey look! No more free epics.</div></div><hr />

We're not getting a wing each week, we're getting a new wing whenever the hell Blizzard thinks it's ok to release the next wing. I don't want Triumph badges, I have nothing left to spend them on, and I've geared up TWO freaken characters in full ToC loot. The only reason I log in now is to spend 2 hours in ToC (1 hour for each character). <br />
<br />
Hell, this even delays Cataclysm because we're doubtfully going to see it until 5-6 months after the Lich King is dead. With them saying &quot;you might not have a lot of attempts until WEEK AND MONTHS after the Lich King is added&quot;, you can freaken guarantee there's no new expansion until at least this time next year.</div></div><hr />

They won't allow hard modes till Arthas is defeated, and Arthas won't be available for over a month? Like I said, I'm no where near hardcore, but this seems like a definite smack to the face of the people who are. They *have* to run nothing but regular modes for over a month before they even get to *try* any of the hard modes? I mean, the whole point of the hard modes was supposed to be to let the better guilds have a greater challenge. Seems to me that if they *really* want a challenge, let them just go straight to hard modes. Why not? It doesn't hurt the rest of us to let those with too much time on their hands beat their heads against difficult content. <br />
<br />
Personally I'd advocate taking any gate off of the hard mode. Release hard mode and regular mode of each wing at the same time. Let the people that bitch that &quot;beating the same boss with more HPs isn't epic enough&quot; go straight to HC. They lose the right to bitch about how easy everything is, and the rest of us are completely unaffected. I'm not going into hard mode till I'm well and truly confident in my ability to beat regular mode, but I don't see any reason to hold back those who are good enough, or stupid enough, to try.</div></div><hr />

As I was going along, I noticed that for every 3 pages I read a new page would pop up and I'm pretty sure they all contain the same QQ bullsh*t about the attempts.<br />
The reason we cant kill Arthas at release date is because the Ashen Verdict offensive has just started. Look at a real war, no matter how many troops you have or how advanced your weapons are, you cant win a war in just one day.<br />
<br />
Also. Could someone sum up all the ICC bosses for me? I would like to see the total of bosses and the ones on wich you have attempts on.<br />
<br />
To the people that find it stupid that you have to kill Putricide, Sindragosa etc before you can kill Arthas, think of Naxx. Or better yet a corridor with 3 doors. In order to go through door number 3, you have to pass door 1 and 2! Simple.<br />
<br />
One more thing. What is the average number of attempts a normal guild gives a boss if they keep wipping on it? At 5 wipes tanks are in yellow/red gear and the most of the players dont feel like dying anymore, theyd rather go grind some rep or badges! Offcourse there are hardcore players that only quit after 20 wipes but thats the minority!<br />

I'm not from any of those super hardcore guilds. I raid a lot but i'm not going around killing hardmodes and saying everything is too easy.<br />
<br />
From my point of view this is bad for hardcores, casuals and everyone in between. To me this is a big F you to all hardcore raiding guilds and a big F you to all casuals who raid as well.<br />
<br />
On the one hand you have hardcores who HATE the limited attempts thing and will have to wait a long time to do all the content that they really care about.<br />
<br />
On the other hand blizzard is FORCING this limited attempts and gate crap on everyone else (including casuals) who want nothing to do with it.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one who doesn't really care about hardcore vs casual or heroic vs reg, but just wants to raid all the content? I want to see the Lich king beaten. I want to finish the story like any good RPG.<br />
<br />
Casuals who feel the same way as I do (want to see the lore) are going to hate the limited attempts and the gate system. Lets say a casual raiding guild uses up all of their attempts on a boss one week, so they can't finish the raid that week on normal. They will feel like they're being punished for not being leet enough for this raid. <br />
<br />
And i'm not an impatient person, but I've been waiting for this boss fight since I first finished naxx. Now I find out when this raid comes out i'm gonna have to wait even longer? It would be like if when Halo 3 came out, bungie says oh wait sorry we're only gonna release 1 level per week, and if you die 5 or more times in a week then you have to wait another week to play. So you will need to wait longer to &quot;Finish the fight&quot;. Do you know how much bitching there would have been?<br />
<br />
I thought blizzard's goals concerning wow were to make it more accessible to all people. To let us play the game the way we want and to have a good time with our friends while we do it. What is so wrong about wanting to raid without the stress of limited attempts and having to wait for all the bosses to be released? Honestly though, the gate system has me angry, but forcing limited attempts onto reg mode makes me want to quit come Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
Heh I was planning on rerolling warlock in Cata, but Gears of war 2 online 10 hours a day doesn't sound so bad right about now. At least Epic games won't say F you, you don't get to play anymore today.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortred</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was trying to read through all the posts to see if anyone took the Lore in concideration in all of this. <br />
As I was going along, I noticed that for every 3 pages I read a new page would pop up and I'm pretty sure they all contain the same QQ bullsh*t about the attempts.<br />
The reason we cant kill Arthas at release date is because the Ashen Verdict offensive has just started. Look at a real war, no matter how many troops you have or how advanced your weapons are, you cant win a war in just one day.<br />
<br />
Also. Could someone sum up all the ICC bosses for me? I would like to see the total of bosses and the ones on wich you have attempts on.<br />
<br />
To the people that find it stupid that you have to kill Putricide, Sindragosa etc before you can kill Arthas, think of Naxx. Or better yet a corridor with 3 doors. In order to go through door number 3, you have to pass door 1 and 2! Simple.<br />
<br />
One more thing. What is the average number of attempts a normal guild gives a boss if they keep wipping on it? At 5 wipes tanks are in yellow/red gear and the most of the players dont feel like dying anymore, theyd rather go grind some rep or badges! Offcourse there are hardcore players that only quit after 20 wipes but thats the minority!<br />
<br />
Why do we humans always look at the 1 bad thing out of 10 good ones?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkelementz</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like this plan, I'm excited by this!<br />
<br />
To anyone saying this is screwing the hardcore players, think of Sunwell back, way back in BC. That place was gated and over a month or so, the barriers all came down and Kil'Jaeden was defeated. This is Blizzard remaining consistent, and also reminding us of the days when you would spend weeks wiping to get ONE boss down. Plus the bosses are harder, and the extra time would be better.<br />
<br />
Also it doesn't say if the limited tries are on the RESPECTIVE bosses (Putricide, Lana'thel, Sindragosa, Lich King) or on any boss. If it is for the specifics, that will be cool.<br />
<br />
Also, this moves to make you more concerned about your character's well being, weeding out stupid mistakes and making us focus. Plus it makes finally downing Arthas and getting Light of Dawn that much more of an achievement, not like the one night Ulduar clear by Ensidia or the 2 day clear of t7 content from release. We actually have to WORK for our free epics now. (gasp!)<br />
<br />
Also, if you are a hardcore raider and complaining about how &quot;This sucks because we need to wipe to learn the fight.&quot; then you are not a hardcore raider. If you were a hardcore raider, you'd be on the freakin PTR every test learning the fights or reading the strats and therefore wouldn't need to wipe. I'm also pretty sure that the week Anub'arak came out a 10 man guild got the 50 tries remaining, so QQ somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's seriously incentive to learn the fights and not dick around. If it makes you feel better, then think of it as perma death if you fail too many times. Oh sorry, no loot this week. Try harder next time! Hey look! No more free epics. <br />

Modern Warfare 2 is owned by this guy, the same person that has made all these changes to World of Warcraft happen, and i refuse to buy it.<br />

He is the same guy that owns all the Guitar Hero and Band Hero games. There is an increasing number of people boycotting his games, because of the way he does things.<br />

No, this will mean that server-first ICC won't go to the actuall top-server guild - it'll go to the jackasses that log on first the day the Arthas encounter is released getting several hours head-start.<br />

With easy flipping of normal to hard they had to do something like this. Force players to actually complete the instance on normal before being able to jump to hardmodes. Much better solution than the &quot;you have to do this or that to activate said hardmode in Uld crap&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd also like to know how many posters here complaining about this have actually done any of the ICC encounters on the PTR. Or are they just going by what they've heard from others?<br />
<br />
To those using the &quot;this is LKs last raid before Cata&quot; card to support their disapproval of this system I can use that card to. Since this is the last major raid of Lich King don't ya think they wanted to make it especially epic feeling? What's so epic about staying up all night in order to clear the raid in one go just so you can stroke your e-peen on some pointless world first crap?<br />

Limited attempts is a daft artificial way of limiting a fight which opens up a group to being completely screwed not by any failure on their part, but by the simple fact that the intertubes are fickle and prone to failure. <br />
<br />
<br />
If the same people are disconnecting at the same points on the same fights week after week, then they are using an out of date addon in their raid UI and are too lazy to figure out what it was and update it or disable it. They are getting spammed by LUA errors and getting booted. So those folks need to fix their UIs simple as that. If it was an ISP issue, then their ISP sucks, but that too is an easy fix by calling your ISP and asking &quot;what gives?&quot; But ISP issues would dictate random DCs. You described broken addons booting people. I was having DC issues myself until I realized it was a random titan panal gold counting addon that was broken. The mod in particular had nothing to do with raiding. But it would always crash my connection at the worst times.<br />
<br />
My point still stands. Ask yourself, how do the extreme hardcore raiders avoid DCs and the like? It's because they run with no addons that could potentially disconnect them. They keep everything updated all the time and don't just click the &quot;Load Outdated Addons&quot; button on patch day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have to announce that since the release date of Cataclysm is being delayed and another troll raid would be lame we need to get as much juice out of the last raid instance as we can. So we're implementing this delayed access thing and not actually open the whole instance for God knows how many weeks. Also we''re implementing a NoT (Nerfing over Time) on it. I hope you continue enjoying your ToC.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Overweight</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, i find the system sort of elegant...<br />
<br />
gated content sucks, i agree, but atleast its more than one boss. OK<br />
<br />
As far as the attempts go, it's only the final boss of each wing, and will be increasing over time. 5 attempts per boss doesn't seem unreasonable, and as you get good at the easier ones it leaves more attempts for the more difficult fights... cool<br />
<br />
Having to beat the other hard modes before you can fight hard arthas is great. It leaves the casuals to see him on easy, and leaves the best of the best loot in the hands of top tier raiders... sure, it may not be totally unique, but even the cloaks in toGC are a good example of standing out. Honesly, I kind of hope hard arthas has another tier of gear just a step above the hard modes... really makes things cool. <br />
<br />
As far as the buff goes, the fact that you can turn it off makes me think you'll have to for hard modes, which means easy modes get even easier for casuals, while hard modes stay hard. <br />
<br />
At first glance, the system sucks... but when you actually stop and think... its actually a fairly elegant idea.</div></div><hr />

Ulduar for 4 months was acceptable b/c it was fun, you could spend alot of hours in there and progress and really feel accomplished when you beat the hard modes.<br />

blizzard just turned the milestone instance into a snooze fest, who the hell wants to be excited for four bosses then wait &quot;Several Weeks&quot; for new content, these assholes should of released this shit the minute Anubarak ToGC died if their gonna make us wait 1 month for every 3-4 bosses.</div></div><hr />

Icecrown CITADEL. The home of Arthas, the Lich KING. <br />
<br />
Do you really, REALLY think Blizzard is going to want 25 schmucks to blast their way through without hardly breaking a sweat and &quot;killing&quot; the Man himself? <br />
<br />
It's a fortress, that literally ARMIES have not been able to break into. Hundreds and Thousands of undead at his command. <br />
<br />
If you think for one moment that it should be fantasy-movie style 2 1/2 hours and the final boss is dead format, you're sadly mistaken.<br />
<br />
The gating lets it play out like a story. You progress slowly through the chapters, absorbing the content and enjoying the detail and effort put into it. <br />
No one likes the guy who skims over the plot just to find out who killed the main protagonist/antagonist and how the story wraps up. &quot;Hey guys did you know that Vader is Luke's father? Man that's a great twist!&quot; &quot;...&quot;<br />
<br />
If you're not the cream of the crop in the Forward Vanguard of the assault, you will get chopped down and you will have to retreat and treat your wounds and recuperate from your losses. Wait for reinforcements and try the assault again. If however you are that top 1%, you will learn the bosses' weaknesses, acquire your upgraded armor and weaponry, and study battleplans while you wait for the next assault to commence. You will still know that you were the first to conquer the adversaries that were available, while the Lich King shakes his fist at you from high on top of his parapets and prepares for the next wave of assaults on his home. Either that or he chuckles in his Frost Rune platemail, clutching his beloved Frostmourne and smiles knowing that the would-be heroes have yet to see the true power of his lieutenants and champions (aka Heroic versions). <br />
<br />
Hardcores will want to download all the episodes from pirate websites and watch them all over 12 hours in 2 days, bitch about the cliffhanger ending and then QQ about how long until the next season is out. Casuals are content to wait for the special edition DVD box set and see everything at their leisure even if the new season has already started. <br />
<br />
True fans will watch the episodes as they come out, eagerly waiting for the next episode to air, talking about the good and bad of the episode they just watched while they wait, maybe even watching it again to see a particularly cool scene or look for something they might have missed the first time. They know when the next episode will be, and they accept that. I suggest you all do the same. That is all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have 2 things going on. The first gating (only certain bosses available at all upon release) means the later bosses don't need to be finished at patch release, buying them more time.<br />
<br />
Second, it keeps people actively subscribed longer. Once people are more or less done with ICC raids, there's nothing but waiting until Cataclysm hits. Solution? String the raid out.<br />
<br />
Me? I have no worries. Once raiding starts to fizzle out in the Cataclysm countdown, I'll be back to what I did while waiting for WotLK; leveling alts with friends.</div></div><hr />

People have debated for years the ethics of the crack-like marketing of the MMO, that it encourages physical and social unhealthiness. Well, this is the responsible answer. Encouraging poopsockers is unethical business. Keeping you &quot;around&quot; in one form or another is smart business.<br />
<br />
There are multiple demographics and lifestyles that make up the WoW community. Placing the &quot;winner's circle&quot; in a place only attainable through unhealthy practices is just asking for trouble, in a world where McDonalds is sued for a customer's obesity.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents. Raiders and casuals are all, potentially, good people, and I have respect for everyone's right to pursue their fun in their way, but don't be surprised when limitations for your own good AND theirs are put in place. This is their sandbox you're playing in, after all.</div></div><hr />

Icecrown CITADEL. The home of Arthas, the Lich KING. <br />
<br />
Do you really, REALLY think Blizzard is going to want 25 schmucks to blast their way through without hardly breaking a sweat and &quot;killing&quot; the Man himself? <br />
<br />
It's a fortress, that literally ARMIES have not been able to break into. Hundreds and Thousands of undead at his command. <br />
<br />
<br />
I love the lore, I love the story and it holds 1/2 of my excitement for the new raid. But blizzard can't have it both ways. You can't say &quot;Ulduar is gonna be hard, but not really, do easy modes and thats what casuals are for, Hard modes are for the people that want to progress and be the best&quot; and then flip the script and give 1/4 of the raid content a month, then put attempt limits on hard modes and gate the instance. Casuals get to go to ICC and raid and pug easily on normal mode. If a group of 10 or 25 people want to burn through to Arthas in the first week and then focus on hard modes and bang their heads into the brick wall of the zone until the nerfs happen thats their choice. It's just fucking retarded to do this to people after sticking us in ToGC with 5 trivial bosses for 3.5 MONTHS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Raids will have a limited number of attempts total each week to defeat the four most difficult encounters in Icecrown Citadel: Professor Putricide, Blood-Queen Lana'thel, Sindragosa, and the Lich King. As these boss encounters are unlocked, the number of attempts available per week will increase. The initial number of attempts provided for defeating Professor Putricide is only five. When Blood-Queen Lana'thel unlocks, the amount of total attempts remaining will increase to 10. Then when Sindragosa and the Lich King unlock, 15 total attempts will be available to defeat all four bosses. After a raid has exhausted their attempts for the week, the Ashen Verdict must withdraw their support and the four most difficult bosses all despawn and become unavailable for the week. The limited attempt system is a feature of both Normal and Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Limited attempts are for the last 4 bosses of ICC only, not the entire zone. You may wipe every 5 minutes, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for the first 6 bosses.</div></div><hr />

this is stupid they should release the content and let people play it.<br />
also i can't beleive there are no rewards for no one dieing and attempts remaining in icecrown lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sucks doesn't it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, no. It sounds like a fairly stable business model. $15 bucks is $15 bucks. &quot;Casual&quot; money spends just as well as &quot;hardcore&quot; money.<br />
<br />
As for your so-called &quot;True WoW fan&quot;: A true &quot;fan&quot; probably wouldn't have a tantrum and quit because they couldn't get all of their toys to play with at once. <br />
<br />
What I think you meant was &quot;Hardcore Raiders, and people who are &quot;hardcore&quot; anything are usually a pain to deal with because you can never really please them. There's ALWAYS something to complain about. The sky is ALWAYS falling somewhere. EVERYTHING is ALWAYS being dilluted, compromised, or ruined.<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it, I don't know how they manage to drag themselves out of bed every morning...</div></div><hr />

Now i'm glad i don't play anymore.<br />
<br />
HaHaHaHa, you're all addicted and your being forced into wasting your money.<br />
<br />
I feel sorry for those that can't stop playing :-*<br />

This betrays a vast ignorance of why people play WoW at all.</div></div><hr />

First Hardmode Kill in April I guess.<br />

Welcome to world of casualcraft, the place where Hardcore Guilds raid less time than Casual guilds.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erom</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard started milking wow since WotLK reliase. Most changes are cosmetical, casual friendly. You should log in into game and feel like a knight on a white hourse with a shiny blade, feeling like outsider among others is bad so here comes ingame comunism.<br />
<br />
People who played through vanila WoW should know how did game change during these years. From loosing EPIC feeling of raiding throught MC, BWL, AQ to total casualisation of any part of the game. Why make content for both casual and hardcore gamers when you can just choose one and the choice is onbvious. Fun for masses = more money, easy as that. And now even raid content is being manualy longered in order to milk players even more.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's next steps : you cant level up your proffeson for more than 50 points a week.<br />
you cant level up your charecter for more then 5 levels a week if its an alt.<br />
you cant get more than 7k honor a day.<br />
you cant earn more than 300g a week.<br />
you cant raise your arena rating for more than 50 a week.<br />
+ Cataclysm sounds like a HUGE masked recycle fest. Change some locations for abit, change some quest routes, add some new quest, remove some old quests, draw few new locations , add 2 new races - here you are, new expansion with epic story is ready.<br />
<br />
Im so glad i quit this game for good</div></div><hr />

Then what do you care? Why are you here?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nexiom</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand why they don't just allow the heroic version of the bosses after you've completed either the wing the bosses are associated with or the actual boss. So you kill Lord marrowgar in the first week on normal and then next week you can kill him on Normal and Heroic. <br />
<br />
Seems like a better thing to do.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrRight</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like it! Seems like a good way to make Arthas last longer then 2 weeks, even on normal mode, without making him so hard that casuals couldn't kill him, and without having to rely solely on the lame gate mechanic.</div></div><hr />
