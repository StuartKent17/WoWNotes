Traditional Tier Set Bonuses Removed in Battle for Azeroth<br />
Gameinformer (www.gameinformer.com) released an interview with Ion Hazzikostas (http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/11/14/world-of-warcraft-removing-traditional-raid-sets-in-battle-for-azeroth.aspx) today that stated raid sets with bonuses will be phased out for Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid set bonuses are being retired for BfA.<br />
Gear will be more heavily themed to the place it comes from.<br />
The team wants gear customization to be expressed through the Azerite system.<br />
Tier sets lock down character slots and limit choices. <br />
Tier has begun to feel more like a drawback with so many different sources to obtain gear today.<br />
Options from these sets will be rolled into how the Azerite system works for more customization in enhancing spells and abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Interviews<br />
We're continuing to take a look at new information from the BlizzCon developer interviews. Method (https://www.method.gg/) Interviews Steve Burke and Chris Robinson at Blizzcon 2017.<br />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard pays attention to what artifact appearances are the most popular and consider that in future art design.<br />
World quests and scaling technology is changing how the team creates the world in game.<br />
There are no plans currently to recreate Gadgetzan in WoW to match the Hearthstone version.<br />
The team will look at revamping faction cities only if it makes sense for the story.<br />
The hubs of BfA reflect the lessons learned from previous hubs.<br />
Allied races will add depth to classes. They will be able to be hero classes if it fits the lore.<br />
Class options for Allied Races are based on the fantasy of the class and not just which faction needs another race option for a specific class.<br />
PVP Warfronts are being talked about, but not something that has been decided on yet.<br />
Low lying fog is something that was planned for Legion but wasn’t implemented until 8.0<br />
There will be visual updates as you progress your Heart of Azeroth.<br />
The team wants the Heart of Azeroth to feel more like the excitement and progression of the initial launch leveling of the Artifact Weapon and not so much the infinite trait artifact power dump from later in the Legion.<br />
It is possible for players to keep multiple gear pieces from the Heart of Azeroth slots to switch between for certain encounters in the game.<br />
Murlocs are not currently planned as an Allied Race.<br />
Allied Races have been completely remapped from their NPC versions to fall in line with current playable races.<br />
There are no plans currently to separate ranged dps and melee dps in the group finder, but it is possible in the future.<br />
<br />

Class Balance in Classic Servers<br />
I personally think its fair to have a discussion about classes/specs in Classic, considering class balancing as a philosophy didn't exist back then as it does now. The idea of a &quot;hybrid tax&quot; was obviously not very good in the grand scheme of overarching class design and it made some specs arguably not viable/unplayable. I'm not suggesting we make huge changes or even small changes at all for that matter, but that it is a worthwhile conversation to have. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20759242036?page=7#127))<br />
<br />
<br />
We've been reading and talking about Classic within the Community team almost every day. Before BlizzCon we were all so nervous and, really, amazed that this project was actually going to be announced at the show. But we do need to make sure things are kept in perspective - we don't want to jump onto too much of a hype/posting train, as its still all coming together and there's not much that is concrete.<br />
<br />
I can guarantee you that the Classic team will be listening, and we will be forwarding as much along as we can. We know this project means a lot to a lot of players, and it means a lot to us too.

Seriously though, tier armor was one of the only things keeping people actively raiding. Now, you'll see the boss once, watch the end cinematic, then farm dungeons for the entire tier until you're geared higher than the Mythic raiders.<br />

This is a terrible idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
is a bad idea when.<br />
A. some people wear even shitty artifact apperances because they were hard to get, and have to show them off to feel better<br />
B. when you had to wear a hidden skin so you could unlock the other colors for completion rate.<br />

I don't really care too much about the set bonuses, but not having a &quot;mage set&quot; or a &quot;warrior set&quot; visually is really awful. I don't like this at all.<br />

<br />
What I am happy about is sets looking more like the places they come from. I mean honestly look at some of the sets from ToS and tell me they look anything like the gear that should be dropping from a legion infested titan ruin.</div></div><hr />

Lolwat. The non-tier gear was recolors of tiers, not the other way around. For example a random drop cloth piece would be recolor of either mage, warlock or priest tier item (or matching belt etc. non tier piece). Or pvp set would be a recolor of a raid set (tradition started in TBC, came back in WOD - Legion). But each patch was bringing 12 different designs in Legion (11 in MOP - WOD, 10 in WOTLK - Cata, etc.). <br />
<br />
Now they don't need to design 3 cloth sets, 4 leather sets etc. What people are worried about is they can design 1-2 sets of specific armor type and call it a day, because they don't need as many as there are classes. <br />
<br />
Also I hope you guys like Trolls and loved the TOT sets, because another Troll raid is incoming with armors designed to match the place they drop in...</div></div><hr />

TOS sets were homage to t6 from TBC (reference to Illidan and Black Temple), uprezzed with extra details. Since the whole expansion is about finishing Illidan's storyline we get touches like remade t6 and Black Temple timewalking to relive the nostalgia.

Anyway, I like the set idea a lot, as long as they still take their time and make nice-looking armour. I find I really dislike sets as a concept for bonuses, at least when there is only one set that's relevant each time (well, 95% of the time). People should be rejoicing if we're moving away from its rigid system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having half your gear locked down for 6 months because of artifacts, legendaries, and tier in a world with Titan forging was so dumb. <br />
<br />
How does it kill raiding? How many people raid just to get tier bonuses? Most people can get 4pc within 4-5 weeks anyway do you all just quit after that? There’s obviously many other reasons people raid. There will still be the heart of Azeroth gear (that doesn’t titanforge, so mythic raids will always be the best), trinkets, and I imagine many other best in slot stuff. Not to mention... *gasp*.. the fun of it. <br />
<br />
Transmog? They are obviously going to keep cosmetic class sets going. You honestly think they would just ditch that for entire pvp seasons and raid tiers?<br />
<br />
Solid change Blizz. Now getting an upgrade will actually be getting an upgrade.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathranis</div><div class="date">2017-11-15, 03:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, 21 tier sets in, I'm finding that the class-themed designs of sets are getting kind of old.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that they'll still be doing sets for each class, but I wouldn't mind taking a break from class-themed armor for some more variety. It would be nice to get some race-themed armor for each armor type, there are a lot of race/class combinations that don't have any armor to reflect their unique identity. Typically the only time we've gotten any sort of racial armor is when we're fighting enemies of the same race (blood elf themed gear in Sunwell, troll themed gear in ZA, etc.)<br />
<br />
I know they said we'll be getting Horde/Alliance themed armor, but so far from what they've showed it's actually more like Orc/Human themed armor.<br />
<br />
Gnomes, night elves, worgen, tauren, Forsaken, goblins, and blood elves are all kind of lacking in themed armor (at least modern armor with decent resolution textures) these days.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Poshadin</div><div class="date">2017-11-15, 03:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am in favor of this. They are right having gear slots locked by tier is kinda lame. Granted with no &quot;legion legendaries&quot; it wouldn't be as bad, but as a prot pally my best legiondaries were helm, shoulders, and sometimes legs. Those are also all tier slots so 6 gear slots are &quot;locked&quot; if I get anything in that slot it's an automatic DE. <br />
<br />
The Azurite armor is basically &quot;the new tier&quot; it is the reason you will want to raid and push progression. It will not TF so a mythic raider is always going to have better than a heroic who will always have better than normal. The progression on the azurite armor will be like tier bonuses.</div></div><hr />

You forgot the Heart of Azeroth gear which is literally a better and more enticing version of tier sets. It also doesn’t Tita forge so you have to mythic raid to get the best version.</div></div><hr />

it doesnt matter, removing set bonuses further pushes raiding down, mythic+ already gives better loot, so now other then trinkets, its close to pointless to raid unless you are a top tier mythic raider who does it for prestige.</div></div><hr />

As it stands now there is no changes to the M+ system, which means you could net a heroic level Azerite piece from just running a dungeon and every week you could get a mythic level one, raiding is not the only way to get those pieces, and Dungeons can offer more itemization variety.<br />

Thing is what a lot of M+ &quot;Titanforging&quot; is is a base level. 915 Mythic 10 Titanforged is the same as just saying 915 Mythic 10. And the limits with the TF system may only lie in the 3 pieces plus chance at tfing being lowered, they have no solid answer on it yet though.</div></div><hr />

No, we should assume it will stay as it is now since they said they're happy with M+ and will just be looking to make improvements.<br />

We can assume max M+ level will still give a heroic level piece baseline with the chest giving mythic baseline.</div></div><hr />

Fuck no, actually havign a slot finished because you got your item was great. The same way WoW worked right until it went to shit with garbage like titanforging and random upgrades. Get a BiS drop, done for that slot. Not grind 24/7/365 for a 0.1% chance of a 0.1% chance of a 0.1% chance it upgrades 50 ilvls.

Raid set bonuses are a pillar of MMORPGs. And no Blizzard, we don't give a f about your dungeons sets aka &quot;Increases versatility by 300 against female demons with black horns&quot; when you equip 2 shitty rings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
why exactly? the bonuses you get from tier will be rolled into the heart of azeroth feature. The raids themselves will have themed &quot;tier&quot; (think Firelands) which I think is way better than dull ass tier sets. Tier sets haven't been interesting looking for a long time anyway. Let's also remember that when you have tier, you lock those pieces regardless of certain clear upgrades, but you don't wanna lose that bonus. Now you don't have to worry about it. It's a win win. Leave it to the community to cry about something that's actually a clear as day amazing change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, what, we're just going to get a cloth,leather,mail and plate generic set that everyone uses from the dungeon now? like its TOGC? so the entire visual identity of raids just gets boiled down to some gimmicky instance-themed universal armor set for everyone of your armor type to wear? no unique class themed set every tier? no unique set bonuses altering your playstyle and giving you big boosts to your performance that can only be gained through raids? is there anything else we can take away from raiding in this game and shove it into some lottery slot machine titanforge system or into 5 man dungeons? Can't wait to see every leather wearer coming out of the troll raid looking like some retarded voodoo gimp, whether they're a druid or a demon hunter. Really fits the class fantasy and makes those months spent progressing in mythic worth it so the ball gag on your gimp outfit that literally half the raid is wearing can be purple instead of blue.<br />
<br />
If this tier set removal ends up being as bad as i think it is(which is always a safe assumption when blizzard does something), there is no way in hell i'm continuing to play in BFA. A boring, lame pvp centric expansion where blizzard is doubling down on titanforging, making m+ even more necessary than it already is, and screwing over raiding and raiders yet again by taking away even more of the very, very few unique rewards offered from it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously though, tier armor was one of the only things keeping people actively raiding. Now, you'll see the boss once, watch the end cinematic, then farm dungeons for the entire tier until you're geared higher than the Mythic raiders.<br />
<br />
This is a terrible idea.<br />
I disagree. True progress raiders (whether hc or mythic) don't go for just the loot and tier set. They go for the kill, gear is an extra to help the progress of the raid team.<br />
<br />
Personally I welcome this change and I agree with Ion's reasons behind it. Giving up 10-15 or more ilvls and/or an optimal stat distribution (to feel the spec smoother to play) for a mere setbonus is out of question for me (having crit and no haste on an item as prot warrior, just feels awful, not to mention the possible ilvl difference - stamina, strength, armour).<br />
<br />
Raid tier set bonuses would be more desirable and useful if we would still have reforging and stats wouldn't matter so much on a single item. Also the multiple sources of gearing is fine to nowadays standards. Admit it, you yourself like to have a few upgrades on each week than waiting for a single item for months.</div></div><hr />

Guys you gotta understand: Usually when Blizzard makes a change that they think will be controversial they give assurances on what is and isnt going to change and are in-depth about them. For this and WPvP they are not answering questions, they are not giving assurances, etc. Its looking grim for WPvP communities, and for unique class sets themed around the particular raid tier. We've had 13+ years to figure out how blizz talks and thinks, and most of us arent surprised anymore when our &quot;knee-jerks&quot; in the right direction, and waiting and seeing only gives it time to be implemented and blizzard to ignore it when people realize it sucks as much as they thought it would.</div></div><hr />

I've been raiding since BWL in Classic and I've mostly been going for the tier. Either be it stats, or looks. Now you can call me lame or whatever, but to me this was something new and fresh that kept me playing all this time. New raid, new character appearance, etc., etc.<br />
<br />
If they remove that, especially the appearance and make it just raid themed for Plate/Mail/Leather/Cloth, like those 'transmog rewards' we were getting from some raids in Legion, then I really don't see the point anymore.

With bonus rolling it is very common to have 2-set or 4-set within the first two weeks of raiding now, and from then on you can only get item lvl upgrades on those 4 items - not fun at all. And with Legion it is even normal to use 2-set and 4-set effectively having 6 items locked down because of bonuses. <br />

You are completely reliant on them because otherwise you can't even compete in damage, so you have to run all difficulties every single damn week just to get your hand on the best in slot ones.<br /> All the people whining about raiding becoming irrelevant:<br />
Bullshit.<br />
<br />
With the titanforge change you can only get max item level azerite pieces (which are by the way the replacement to set bonuses and legendaries, so they are important as fuck) from mythic raiding, rated pvp or mythic+ weekly chests.<br />
Good luck trying to get the exact piece you need from a weekly random loot.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is simply opening up the wow endgame to more than just mythic raiders, why are you so god damn bitter about that? Some of you act like the world is about to end just because they try to open the game to a bigger audience.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you realize it, but the absolute raid expansion WoD, where the only endgame was high tier raiding, was a complete disaster. Blizzard needs to implement more ways to enjoy the endgame and they need to consider, that most players don't want to commit 20+ hours each week in mythic raiding, just to have a challenging and fun experience.<br />
<br />
I despise this &quot;Oh you cannot raid? Go do worldquests or something lmao&quot; attitude. As a mythic+ player I can just as well argue, that I am forced to do your stupid raids just to get the god damn best in slot set-pieces.</div></div><hr />

It does worry be a bit though.<br />
Like when I look at my raid group I know that 50% give or take is only there for the gear. <br />
If Blizzard takes away &quot;reasons&quot; for those people to be there.. like taking away tier sets (which is 1 of the 2 reasons to raid for those people.. trinkets being the 2nd) then I might lose half my raid group over night.<br />

Don't get me wrong, I actually like the change. However, it allows blizz to be even more lazy when it comes to designing tier sets for new raids. For instance, all leather could share the same raid tier. As long as we still get our class specific tier sets, i'm all in for this.</div></div><hr />

I doubt that since you were raiding there was not a point, at any time that you hesitated to equip a certain piece to get the bonus instead of a much better item that you already used.<br />
<br />
What do you think, why are there more than 4 pieces of a tier set, despite the setbonus comes with 4? Because not all of them have optimal stats and at least they give you some choices. However having more than 2 out of 6 tier pieces with terrible stats and equipping them just for a not too good bonus feels &quot;forced&quot; and ties my hands.<br />
<br />
This time, on this warrior I chose the stats over any tier bonus. Despite I have all tier pieces, I have only the 2 piece bonus, because those pieces have the proper ilvl and stats that mean upgrade to me. If I would insist strictly to tier pieces, the spec I play would feel (and would be) slower to perform, because of the lack of haste. A few items with or without haste can be gamebreaking, because you can definitely feel a 6-8% difference in the class mechanisms. Less Shield Slam resets, slower autoattack (Devastator), longer cd-s on abilities, less rage.</div></div><hr />

Like when I look at my raid group I know that 50% give or take is only there for the gear. <br />
If Blizzard takes away &quot;reasons&quot; for those people to be there.. like taking away tier sets (which is 1 of the 2 reasons to raid for those people.. trinkets being the 2nd) then I might lose half my raid group over night.<br />
I'm not sure why changes like this are needed. We need more incentive for people to raid, not less..<br />
They are going to compensate set bonuses with that heart of azeroth thing (as I heard). <br />
<br />
Also if there would be a raid only with legendary item shards dropped from bosses, and you would need like 3 months of farming before it becomes obsolete, ppl would still go there, because it gives them upgrade.<br />
<br />
The same thing happened with MoP hc dungeons. Everyone farmed them, because they gave upgrade tokens to your current gear, despite they were faceroll content.<br />
We also have artifact power now which is an upgrade. Ppl no longer go to EN or NH to get gear and tier set. They go for AP and possible legendaries, so they still go and farm them, because they are somewhat relevant.<br />
<br />
So you should only create a content which upgrades player power on a unique way, be it only a specific raid or dungeon, players will go there to grab their upgrades, call it tier set bonus, artifact power or valour token etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again Magni said. And on Wowhead it seems the quest was added today.<br />
<br />
But what do I know. I can't find a new quest at least.<br />
<br />
The first cutscene with Aggramar and Sargeras is named Vision of torment. This new quest is named Vision of fear. You might be correct man, but the wording of the questinfo and quotes are different.<br />

It was the staple of raiding since the very beginning of WoW and suddenly, 13 years later it doesn't work? Also it was one of the main things for many of people to oven enter raids (yes, your great group of hardcore raiders is there for the progress alone but a lot of people are there only for the gear) so now getting raiders will be even harder.<br />

Let's also remember that when you have tier, you lock those pieces regardless of certain clear upgrades, but you don't wanna lose that bonus. Now you don't have to worry about it. It's a win win. Leave it to the community to cry about something that's actually a clear as day amazing change.<br />

Seriously though, tier armor was one of the only things keeping people actively raiding. Now, you'll see the boss once, watch the end cinematic, then farm dungeons for the entire tier until you're geared higher than the Mythic raiders.<br />

<br />
What I am more concerned about is class identity through tier appearances. I enjoyed having unique class appearances, like paladin's Judgement set, or shaman's Ten Storms.

Quite the opposite, removing tiers from raiding creates a great filter mechanism.<br />
Some people will stop feeling 'forced' to LFR, so their community should be better and less toxic now.<br />

Raiding is about downing bosses and achieving as part of a team, especially on mythic. Getting that extra notch in the belt and working towards that next kill is what it's about, even if you don't get Cutting Edge. Tier is just a bonus along the way. Honestly, besides the way my new tier set looks each raid tier, I never got excited about it like I did back in the day. I'm looking forward to seeing and learning more about the Azerite system to freshen things up again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard needs to aknowledge that there are, in fact, those of us who also hate Mythic + as a system. Those of us who don't think adding random affixes that unfairly punish certain classes/specs just for the sake of added difficulty isn't fun.<br />
<br />
With this change, I assume that... at best... 50% of BiS gear will be from raids and 50% will be from Mythic +. This means that, no matter what, if you want to partake in high end raiding you'll be forced into doing copious amounts of M+ because of titanforging. It also means you'll be forced to run a majority of the same keys in order to target the slots you want to earn. <br />
<br />
I always like that once I had Mythic tier, I had at least some amount of 'best-in-slot'. It was a comforting feeling. At the moment on my balance druid I have 4 piece Mythic Tier 20 and 2 piece mythic tier 19. I have two legendaries and an Arcano Crystral. These are all BiS. this leaves me with One ring, one belt, one neck and one trinket slot to fill. I was fortunate enough to get a Tarnished Sentinel's Medallion so this leaves me with 3 slots to fill. Oh, and boots, 4 slots to fill.<br />
<br />
In Legion, secondary stats are almost unfathomably powerful compared to how they used to be. Going as far as being better than primary stats. Forgoing my opinion on whether or not this is good for the game, the point remains that it makes a piece with 'the perfect stats' completely incomparable to a piece with the worst stats. In a raid, there will usually be at most 3 pairs of boots that drop (one to match each set esthetic). Let's consider how many permutations of secondary stats there could be with the 4 stats we have, that number comes to 6. <br />
<br />
Thus how I got to my number of 50% of gear.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of rerolling to hunter for the next expansion, but this system means I can't possibly do that with my limited time to play. No matter how good of a hunter I am (I'm mid 80s on WCL for hunters, nothing spectacular), I don't have the sheer playtime to sit there being spam declined from groups all night.<br />
<br />
Especially at the start of the expansion, when M+ is truly challenging, the stigma around classes that are considered &quot;bad for M+&quot; or &quot;bad for this week's affixes&quot; makes the game practically unplayable for these classes under the new system.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to be melodramatic but this change more than likely signals the extension of the break I'm currently on to extend at least past the first tier of next expansion. I'll wait for the Relinquished vendors to come out. It'll actually be the first time I don't play an expansion on launch. =/ <br />
<br />
I just can't support World of Titanforgecraft and that's where we're heading more and more, it's both frustrating and disappointing to me that they took this design path but I do understand it. WoW is a business for them and the players who put the most hours in make their game look good. Maybe I'm just old and the game isn't geared towards people who can only put in 3-4 hours a night (which I already thought was more than most people).<br />
<br />
Truth is, if you want to play any other game, 3-4 hours won't be enough any more. 1/3 of that, if you're lucky, will be looking for keys and 2/3 will be running keys and you can draw a swift X through all other content.<br />
<br />
Again, very disappointing.</div></div><hr />

Quite the opposite, removing tiers from raiding creates a great filter mechanism.<br />

To me this means that the gear will not be class specific design, and it will be armor type specific to match the theme of the raid. So they will only create 4 different armor sets for a raid. Kinda lame =/</div></div><hr />

What you say is total bullshit. Mythic+ is the best way for gear catch up. If you even have friends who will get you through lvl10-15 runs right after hitting 110, its a full faceroll race to the current hc/myhic level gear. From there you can have your own key and spam decline others if you want to for your &quot;max level&quot; key runs. I dont know if taking set bonuses is good though, they are the last remaining incentives to find a guild and raid with them. I havent raided in this expansion, only pugged the curve achies, yet my ilvl was always at the same level as mythic palyers ilvl. Mythic+ is already an alternative to raiding, with set bonuses gone the mythic raiding will decline even more. I dont know, i dont give a shit, i dont like to suffer because 1 of the 20 people will almost guaranteed to fuck up something...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is an awful idea.<br />
<br />
And current form is so great? <br />
<br />
I have so many nontier pieces in my bag that dispaly 15-30% upgrade after simming and yet I cant use them because they would break my set and lower my dps. And I cant really use another slot for tier because other slot is occupied by BiS legendary (shoulders). <br />
<br />
So maybe decision to move &quot;set bonusses&quot; to the new azerite system is not that bad idea?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garoh</div><div class="date">2017-11-15, 05:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I disagree. True progress raiders (whether hc or mythic) don't go for just the loot and tier set. They go for the kill, gear is an extra to help the progress of the raid team.<br />
<br />
Personally I welcome this change and I agree with Ion's reasons behind it. Giving up 10-15 or more ilvls and/or an optimal stat distribution (to feel the spec smoother to play) for a mere setbonus is out of question for me (having crit and no haste on an item as prot warrior, just feels awful, not to mention the possible ilvl difference - stamina, strength, armour).<br />
<br />
Raid tier set bonuses would be more desirable and useful if we would still have reforging and stats wouldn't matter so much on a single item. Also the multiple sources of gearing is fine to nowadays standards. Admit it, you yourself like to have a few upgrades on each week than waiting for a single item for months.<br />
<br />
This is my point, though. Like you said, progression raiders are there for the kill, but 4-6 weeks into progression when you've got AOTC, what's to keep your raiders motivated then? It used to be we had filling in that last BiS slot, or getting your last few tier pieces you finish your set. A good raid team wouldn't mind running over and over even when fully geared either to help the last couple of raiders fill in those spots. But what's to keep them there now? <br />
<br />
I realize I'm in the minority here, as I raid lead a rather small group (6-7 core raiders and we pick up a few along the way). But it's disheartening to see the small groups get shafted over and over. We used to run heroic 10 mans back in the day, but my only hope of getting us into mythics now is to recruit, and Blizzard keeps taking away everything I have to keep my raiders from losing interest.</div></div><hr />

You would be out of your mind to not have tier and try to do a 21 key as dps. And lets not forget pvp while we are at it. A lot of pvpers still feel compelled to do non pvp because gear is much easier to get (and control what pieces you want).<br />
<br />
Furthermore, for those who don't understand what is happening next expansion, and it looks like many of you still don't, we basically get evolving tier bonuses ALL EXPANSION. Several of your items will have tier bonuses that you pick from, combining effects. Removing the old tier bonus system was a design choice to avoid the painfully obvious redundancy of tier bonuses with the new system.<br />
<br />
Lastly, you can get tier bonuses from LFR in the current game ... LFR? Is someone really going to cry and tell us how unique and special something is that you can get in LFR?!</div></div><hr />

I agree with you. My Main was a WW Monk in MoP and in WoD, but during WoD and now Legion the class/spec has changed so much (removing of abilities) that the class is no longer fun. The spec has been simplified to no end, I feel like I am playing a Diablo 3 character when I play my WW Monk now. Even the stats in our character screen has been simplified big time. This is why I can't wait for the Vanilla server and other old school servers.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be surprised if they in the next expansion told us that we wouldn't get more new expansions tbh, I got a feeling that they are intentionally trying to phase out raiding in favor of re-playable content like Mythic+ and Timewalking and they're going to downsize Mythic to 10 next expansion before WoW goes to maintenance mode.</div></div><hr />

A big benefit to set bonuses is just the idea of completing a set. Which is a big deal. Without it, the only reason to have them is transmog, which is compelling for some, but not for most.<br />

We used to run heroic 10 mans back in the day, but my only hope of getting us into mythics now is to recruit, and Blizzard keeps taking away everything I have to keep my raiders from losing interest.<br />

If it's a DPS loss it's not an upgrade now is it? That's always been part o this game, for 13 years, change for changes sake is always bad.</div></div><hr />

who could have guessed that once they removed set bonuses, they wouldn't make individual class sets at all anymore. ROFL</div></div><hr />

Instead of having to design 12 different armor sets they now only need to design 4 (1 for each armor class).<br />
<br />
Kind of sucks for the transmog mixing and matching.<br />
<br />
Transmog is not really needed for beating demons and dragons or other players.<br />
<br />
The stats what counts.<br />

<br />
Animations delayed, fewer new assets being added to the game per tier.<br />
<br />
I wonder what Project Titan 2.0 is being funded.</div></div><hr />
