5 New articles have been added to the site, most of the articles for the Patch 3.2 should be here now but I'm still missing a few things that I will try to post in a few hours.

They technically didn't do it for S6 ending either. They said it would end with the patch but no typical &quot;2 weeks, son.&quot; it was just &quot;It's over.&quot; when it finally came.</div></div><hr />

1600 - Chest<br />
1650 - Battlemaster's<br />
1750 - Cloak<br />
1800 - T1 Weapon<br />
1900 - Helm<br />
2000 - Shoulders<br />
2200 - T2 Weapon</div></div><hr />

<br />
If what's on the PTR is what there's going to be, there are no NEW Heirloom Trinkets, just the same two PvE and one PvP (one per faction) that currently exist. There are just PvE chests being added (at same price as shoulders), and two new weapons (including, finally, one for feral druids), and all current PvE heirlooms will also be purchasable for Champion's Seals at ~150% their Emblem of Heroism cost (60 for chest/shoulders/1H weapons, 75 for trinkets, 95 for 2H weapons).</div></div><hr />

It's not as fresh as I hoped it would be.<br />
The tournament thing seems rather boring, they change arena seasons too fast and they should have added those xp chests a lot earlier. I mean seriously I waisted all my emblems on frozen orbs -_-'.<br />
Well I guess wow just starts to bore me...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fugazi</div><div class="date">2009-08-03, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) What about BG XP? Was it tested by anyone? It works? What are values?<br />
2) What about JC? How we get tokens back?<br />
3) Deadly PvP sigils stay and you can buy them for 15300 honor at apprentice arena vendor.<br />
4) Rating of everything went down - furious is 800 to 1350 rating, rest is in post above. New sigils req. 1800 now also.<br />
5) You can still buy T1 Weapon for 2v2. Only T2 weapon and shoulders req. 3v3/5v5 ratings so it seems whole drama change won't really affect 99% population.<br />
6) Shields and &quot;book&quot; OH went down from 1950 to 300 arena points cost.<br />
<br />
TLDR, most important things:<br />
1) You can buy PvP sigil for honor only.<br />
2) You can buy T1 Weapon with 2v2 still.<br />
3) 3 pieces of new ilvl251 set gear is easy to get now - 1400 for gloves, 1550 for legs, 1600 for chest. As VoA drop legs and gloves only it will become much less important now.</div></div><hr />

Click on the heirloom item page, click on the kind of armor you want to see, read the stats. <br />

I don't believe there has been an official confirmation or denial, but I feel quite confident in saying that the faction change is not coming out with 3.2</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;New chest heirlooms are being introduced in the next content patch, note that the 10% experience bonus stacks with the one from the heirloom shoulders. They can be bought for 40 x Emblem of Heroism or 60 x Champion's Seal &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Two maces have been added to the game. They can be bought for 40 (1H) / 65 (2H) x Emblem of Heroism or 60 (1H) / 95 (2H) x Champion's Seal &quot;<br />
<br />
^^^^<br />
<br />
well... cant say it 100 % sure, but i don't think ull need crusader title for it (hope not too 0.o), didnt read it anywhere</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exotic Mounts vendor in Dalaran. Cold Weather Flying trainer/vendor, Hira Snowdawn in Krasus Landing. (Thx jvv! :D)<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry if I missed any details on them, but wasn't there talk of Heirloom Trinkets? I seem to remember a blue post about them... Has anyone seen them on the PTR or have they not been released yet?<br />
<br />
Same as the existing trinkets (no changes except can now also be purchased with seals).<br />
<br />
<br />
Has it, at any point, been confirmed that the ability to faction-transfer will be available when 3.2 comes out? <br />
<br />
No. Faction Transfer is &quot;soon&quot; status, not in 3.2.<br />
<br />
<br />
well i dont think its comeing on live in the next 2 weeks.. since we have still not seen the Priest and Rogue Q &amp; A.<br />

So the question remains.<br />
<br />
<br />
All the items with no pictures are ALREADY available in the game, and none of them are changing their stats at all, so there's no reason to put the info on a 3.2 changes page. Check Wowhead or in-game on Live for info. (The only change to EXISTING heirlooms is that they will ALSO be available for Champion's Seals in addition to their current Emblem of Heroism availability. That's it.)</div></div><hr />

indeed, it was one of my fav lookin maces, the only weird thing is why now? why did they wait to add the 1h/2h maces? when all other weapon types have been accounted for... damn blizzard logic</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have it as 213 gear, however, when you scroll over the item it is clearly 219 gear... so is Heroic Champion 213 or 219 gear<br />
<br />
Please clarify - thank you</div></div><hr />

It won't have a lock out, though it won't drop Emblems of Conquest or Champion's Seals.</div></div><hr />

FAP is no longer listed exclusively on an item. It is now included on any item with a DPS higher than 55. You will not get much/any FAP until you are in your high 50's probably, but it will have FAP just like any other weapon does now.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I was wondering the same thing. These are new slots for WG gear; will they be upgrading the current ones with better loot, and if not, will the old gear still be available for purchase?</div></div><hr />

&quot;There's two ways you can get the new heirlooms. If you purchase them with Champion's Seals, you will need the Crusader title to get the vendor to sell to you. If you purchase them with Emblems of Heroism, you don't need anything special besides the currency.&quot;</div></div><hr />
