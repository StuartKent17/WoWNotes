Blizzard has previously stated that legendaries will never simply &quot;drop,&quot; they will always require some crafting.<br />
<br />
Perhaps we could be seeing artifacts in the near future?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">insaneRyu</div><div class="date">2007-06-25, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">mh.<br />
still missing: <br />
lvl 70 Dmg-Caster Legendarys, lvl 70 healer-Legendary, lvl 70 Ranged-Physical Legendarys and sort of a lvl 70 &quot;Hybrid&quot;-Legendary<br />
<br />
i fail to see, why Blizzard distributes Legendarys in such a unfair manner.<br />
they did it in the lvl 60 endgame and now they are continueing in the same way for the lvl 70 endgame...<br />
<br />
but anyways. grats to Forte and the lucky one who got the Glaive</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Regis</div><div class="date">2007-06-25, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess the reason no more legendary weapons are in the game is because they are just that - legandary. They require a lore behind them, and/or be wielded by a epic enemy. Like Sulfuras from Ragnaros, Thunderfury from the Thunderaan, or the Warglaive's from Illidan. Or Ashbringer.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nialyah</div><div class="date">2007-06-25, 02:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well rumours about Book of Medivh is out even that there might be 2 books?<br />
There's plenty of lore too pick on.<br />
The Skull of Gul'dan could be a nice sight. It'd be nice to see Blizzard actually giving Legendaries a special abbility in this case it could give you shadowform alike or whatever something that fits the current use Illidan gets from it. <br />
<br />
With an upcomming patch we could may face something many have been waiting for, Neltharion aka Deathwing. It's not known if he really died or not but it seems not. With him in the game we could see much more about the currently pretty unknown Chromatic Dragonflight and maybe get to know another Legendary, The Demon Soul or The Dragon Soul.<br />
<br />
I think the &quot;problem&quot; is that the evil overlords the incredible masters of doom has yet to use healing maces and cudly small harry potter sticks (look at ateish &gt;.&gt;) (/sarcasm off) but instead a mofo big weapon of mass destruction (look at hand of raggy)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nihilum downs Kael'thas First, Forte gets Phoenix<br />
Nihilum downs Illidan first, Forte gets Legendary<br />
<br />
I'm hoping that eventually Medivh's Book shows up as a legendary offhand =x or maybe some other random (hopefully caster) item, I'm tired of seeing so many warrior items..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Acccording to an NPC, Neltharion still lives, so it's possible we'll see him eventually. But the Demon Soul was destroyed by Rhonin. When it went, the power that all the dragon flights put into it was redistributed back to each dragon. The Demon Soul won't be popping up again. Even if it did, it's too powerful according to the lore, and would probably remain a GM Weapon.<br />
<br />
But casters and non-melee need some Legendary Lovins, I'll agree to that. Atiesh was a nice gesture, but it seemed like it came too close to TBC, and now there are plenty of &quot;better&quot; weapons available than it. And since we're still waiting on Ashbringer, that'll be yet another melee legendary :(</div></div><hr />

I mean look at Hand of Rag vs atiesh, I bet warriors wished they had a naxx legendary.</div></div><hr />
