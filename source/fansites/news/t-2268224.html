So they could just print high number relic to get trait everyone want.<br />
<br />
My issue with the present system is that you have a double RNG. You want a specific relic WF/TF then you want it to roll a not awful Rank 2 crucible trait and the Rank 3 trait you really want.<br />
<br />
Also, that screw the loot system where people will always want to keep/roll for relics to see what kind of trait they will roll. People might no longer trade them, what awesome with the personal loot system we have atm.</div></div><hr />

Reforging had lots of downsides, such as trying to perfectly get the hit or expertise cap.<br />
Every item that doesn't have your best two stats you would reforge to have your best stat. This didn't really make for interesting choices.<br />
This also narrowed the distinction between items, making them feel more similar.<br />
It also made it harder to evaluate upgrades, as you had to look at the item in its current state as well as how you could reforge it.<br />
There were some good parts, such as giving players choices to make.&quot;<br />
<br />
I get a choice now.... Does the item have haste or not? No then pass. Wait for RNG to give me a haste item. If you want me to choose the iLVL over what secondary stat the item gives me then just have a primary and no secondary or all secondaries are equal. <br />
<br />
Honestly reforging to me was fun but I like number crunching.</div></div><hr />

You don't need to wait for anything, the whole region will be at AK41 (16 million%) on day 1, and AK55 (630 million%) 14 weeks later<br />
<br />
Even playing field.<br />
<br />
The second you hit 110 on an alt or returning main then you could get 60 traits within a day at AK55 since they also remove the pre-requirements for 3rd relic slot and 7.2 traits.<br />
<br />
AP rate will increase by about 157.5 x the speed, without increasing current AP trait costs.<br />

<br />
5 days or 7 days, doesn't matter much. The 4 hours thing was more of a band-aid fix.<br />
<br />
Sure I agree it's a bullshit timegate of 3 months, but they just don't want people to farm at 630million% for 3.5 month.<br />
<br />
Even then, if 7.3.5 lasts longer then 6 months, maxing a weapon to 101 is certainly possible for the most hardcore.</div></div><hr />

True I agree but he may also have said that because he can't really talk about 8.0 yet. My point really is I would have thought by now they'd have a solid &quot;You'll be able to do &lt;this&gt;&quot; answer to the question rather than &quot;Err we're still thinking about it&quot; type answer. Personally I don't see what's so bad about the current weapon system that would make them want to abandon it all and revert in 8.0 to normal weapons.</div></div><hr />

Blizz still making bosses, where rouges needed, else the whole fight fucked up (rouges example for this post, since they have the most utility spells to surive almost any dmg). You cant bring xyz other spec not because their dmg sucks, but because they dont have tons of broken utility like rouges. They could simple address it, by removing/balancing utility spells, or make boss &quot;soaking&quot; spells which deal tons of dmg, to ignore such utility spells, (example iceblock, blessing of protection, divine shield, and rouge feint/cloak of shadows). Until this one not fixed, peps forced to play &quot;broken&quot; utility classes (talking about progress guilds), or they wait until the bosses nerfed to dust. <br />
<br />
This was the same like TBC. All raids (25 players), used atleast 5 shamans , cos broken utility spells (bl, totems). If you played shaman in TBC you had fix spot in raids.</div></div><hr />

Try doing something that should've been account wide on 12 characters and see how you feel when you're done, idiot. <br />

Use your brain before you comment. It's a long ass chain that takes months to complete and you're bound to do it on every character as they were incapable of making it account wide which the entire community has been pretty vocal about. Nobody likes it the way it currently is. <br />

They also just said they probably are not going to be removing those appearances availability for transmog post-Legion. So come next expansion you will be able to solo most, if not all of that chain. I thingk that's fine.

As everything else, your catching up will start as soon as you're back, not while you're away.<br />

So yes, you'll be behind others. But with the increasing AK, you'll catch the others just like you do now. You'll never be the same as someone who plays non-stop, but you'll be a lot closer (like currently unlocking your concordance faster, but not getting artifact 60, 63 or more like the rest).</div></div><hr />

From people in top guilds I've been friends with progression for the next tier starts the moment they kill the last boss. They don't really get to skip split runs and stuff so it's not like it's any better for them. They're just good enough to get it done with in a day.</div></div><hr />

Legion is coming to an end as the story doesn't seem to be progressing that much beyond 7.3. And for what's it worth some of us have been working almost day and night to unlock this stuff and are still nowhere close to finishing. <br />
<br />
The last 7 months i've been working on 6 characters and nothing but artifact appearances, that obviously contains doing the content in the expansion, but i haven't enjoyed doing some content, it's just all about doing what the next unlock requires. 6-7 times I don't even know how many of doing Balance of Power progress every week, worst fucking design ever. PVP hasn't been about pvp anymore, it's just what gets you the fastest prestige, cause it's the slowest thing ever. And of course the skin you want is the last tier one.<br />
<br />
I've done the bare minimum to raid or anything really so I can get as many of them as possible on as many characters as possible. Yet I haven't even touched a single challenge yet outside my main, no time simply. And for PVP i've pretty much had to choose only one character to go beyond the first tier of unlocks cause it takes so much time to prestige. <br />
<br />
I just completed Balance of Power on all the characters I needed it with. <br />
Next week will be all about doing the Glory of Legion Hero and more pvp grind, i'm prestige 5 so 10 more levels to go. Intentionally i've saved the challenges for Argus and 910 gear hoping that's enough to bruteforce some of the specs that I don't play as much hence don't have the experience or skill with, but i'm not sure. Main is now 911 and cannot do the challenge yet, 80% is the best attempt of it on the best day with optimal setup and luck, he should be 915 or 920 in 7.3 so not really worried about that, it's the rest who can't be geared that high, just simply on the matter of the fact that it already takes 3 entire weekdays to do 6 toons through all LFR wings, cause that's the highest one can pretty much go, with the amount of time needed. There's no time to do guild raiding on one character cause that's a 2-3 evenings and only gets you one character high enough, when you need every toon to be that minimum 910-915. Heroic KJ, just buy the kill at some point with gold, no time to progress there. Same for RBGs, just buy 10 wins with gold. <br />
<br />
It was already said the system was meant to encourage to be played only by one character at launch, but Blizzard should know better that people will go above and beyond it.<br />
I already just had to cut half of my alts out of this progress on the basis of who had the best skins cause 1-1,5 year expansion simply even as a full time job is not enough time to unlock every skin that you want. At launch and after WoD I myself was expecting at least the minimum of a 2 year expansion maybe 3 or 3,5 years of Legion to do this, but it doesn't look like it.<br />
<br />
This is a working task that doesn't even have confirmation are we doing this for nothing? I've given up my other life outside this game to unlock these things that may or may not be usable in the future, just to prevent another CM mode set setback that if you didn't unlock them now you can't use them. Would be nice to know if we spend the entire year of doing something that if it's still there or not, cause this is something some of us actually care about. Last 4 years my WoW has been transmogs, nothing more, would be nice to know with a 100% certainty not a guess of maybe at this point that i'm not spending my time for nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Use your brain before you comment. It's a long ass chain that takes months to complete and you're bound to do it on every character as they were incapable of making it account wide which the entire community has been pretty vocal about. Nobody likes it the way it currently is. <br />
<br />
So yes, it's insanely long.<br />
<br />
I'm doing it on every char, start new one every two months. It's still only 9 dungeons and around 5 total raid clears (+few quests). Doable in 2-3 weeks (and you must dedicate only few hours a week for that). I give you numbers, you call me idiot - yeah, arguments are clearly on your side.<br />
<br />
And this &quot;vocal community&quot; is like children than ask for more candy, eat everything and cry that there is no candy left. I like to play all chars, after I saw how apperances works, I set reachable goal - I will get only basic, recolors are impossible to get on every char - and distributed my time between different chars. I will never be burned out or have nothing to do.</div></div><hr />

Still on the fence whether to come back full time though knowing me I will end up doing so and playing this alongside FF14, GW2 and Skyforge.<br />
<br />
Glad that it's only 3 weeks of gating rather than the long boring wait that was 7.2 and Broken Shore.<br />
<br />
On Raid Finder though if they want to make it harder then they need to stop listening to those crying it's too hard. Otherwise we end up with Fallen Avatar LFR where they remove a big part of it. I agree with them on wanting to go back to the difficulty it was in Mists.<br />
<br />
However they have nobody to blame but themselves for making the fights too easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is this in any way worse then we had before?<br />
<br />
Instead of every player doing a research that takes 5 days, now the system just automatically increases the rank by one every week. If you join a couple weeks later, you're not behind, you automatically get to the same place that everyone else is.<br />
<br />
The 4 hour research was solely for catch-up purposes for players that were behind the curve - which is not something that will happen to anyone in this system.<br />
If you were at the top of the AK research curve, it always took 5 days to research.<br />
<br />
If anything, this makes it far easier for alts and people coming back later. Hit level 110 and be immediately at current max AK, do one world quest and have Concordance unlocked from the huge multiplier. Alts could possibly buy catch-up tomes now, but returning players could not.<br />
<br />
If you saw the 4 hour research time on your characters, you probably were not all that active of a player, and the automatic catch-up should benefit you even more.</div></div><hr />

Somehow you think getting the Corrupted Ashbringer is going to be 'easier' in later expansions? Or that you can overgear the RNG of the Withered Army Training chest? <br />
<br />
Your time investment is hardly changing in those since most of those hidden appearances are not actually tied to your gear level.<br />

They made it a little too hard, but that allowed them to nerf it. Hundreds of hours of testing took place internally.<br />
This tier increased healing requirements across the board by increasing raid damage, but they went a little bit too far.<br />
The internal testing team was better than anticipated on this fight and has been getting better over the years, so when they increased everything by a percentage to make it challenging for the top guilds that was a little bit too much.<br />
<br />
Really? Are they arguing that their internal test team is WF level? Better than Method etc? And if they tested for hundred of hours how did they mistune the fight so badly??<br />
<br />
<br />
The team learned a lot from how Patch 7.2 unfolded. Day 1 it felt like there wasn't a lot to do after the intro.<br />
<br />
<br />
SO tired of this line. I knew that 7.2 felt bad the first day I played it - it was dead obvious that there wasn't a lot you could do. How the hell did they not get this internally/</div></div><hr />

everything else so far, good to see more account wide stuff. what i've done on ptr, that is an ok amount of questing upfront, that's pretty good.<br />

Anyone who is level 110 well automically go to AK40 when they Ding, or whatever AK we are on that week, for example, If someone just starts playing when 7.3 hit they will hit 110 and be AK 41. If some hit 110 2 week after, they will be 43, like everyone else.</div></div><hr />

Some of these guys making this were there when the game was good but they push this as if it was as good. I remember in vanilla when we read the patch notes, each chapter was like a new game, they were adding, creating, amazing us all. But since WOTLK and only until first half as second half was poor, something very bad happened and the game suffered. We have every right to complain. If you had bottled WOTLK you would still be making as much. I bought CE, I have seen the prod work behind the scenes. That is clearly not the case now. So one wonders, and I have just prooved it to myself by logging in on my last free offerd day to see how many people are on on a major merged server (that never was a good idea) and it's totally dead - what is the plan. <br />
<br />
What is clear the major creatvity behind Wow has left for one to two years already. What is also clear is that this is one of the biggest gaming franchises ever. And it's dead. Also, nothing new from blizz for a while.<br />
<br />
What happens next is Wow 2. I say it every month but it's so obvious.<br />
<br />
ALL the wow players will come back. They will get 20 million subs in one week after launch, ok month after free launch. Feautures:\<br />
<br />
- Dynamic world: quest zones dynamically spread, friendly zones might not be same day after - ongoing struggle but home bases still fighting opposition<br />
- war zones - factions advance and retreat<br />
- sub classes/sub races -cusrtomisable class identitities<br />
- professions - etude/uni - long path to excellemce, no 60 min AH buy/max, have to make it to the top<br />
- improved AH<br />
- back to vanilla dungeons like strat/dm/<br />
<br />
christ I will stop there. It's so sad - Blizz why kill the game, YOU CAN TURN THIS AROUND. Wow 2 will be announced this year.</div></div><hr />

No WoW 2 won't be while WoW is still successful.<br />
<br />
But if you want to believe they are killing the game because you don't agree with the direction then go for it I guess. You are entitled to an opinion after all.<br />
<br />
And if you really think they will go back to Vanilla design then that is hilarious. Vanilla design is dated at best.</div></div><hr />

After Legion. The +15 skins and Mage Tower challenge ones will be unobtainable. If you already have them then you don't have anything to worry about.<br />
<br />
After Legion. Any other skin can be obtained but it will still be tied to Legion related content. According to that interview the devs are trying to decide how to tie it in.</div></div><hr />

In WoD, we spent like 10-15 hours getting the Gold CM, and in Legion, some of us, spent hundreads of hours, getting the different skins, for the 12 classes, and then we have to do it all over again... maybe not the same way as we did in Legion, but still.

The other skins can still be obtained after Legion. And if you want to go back and get them you can but anything you have now you keep.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus it feels bad to go back to greens, blues, epics... meh. Oh well, we'll see how it unfolds.<br />
<br />
I like the artifact system, too, but in the end i'd be okay with going back to normal weapon drops.... as long as we get to keep our artifact apperances. If we don't get all unlocked appearances as a transmog apperance, i'm going to throw a giant shitfit.</div></div><hr />

The MMO-Champ guys wrote it wrong. You are right, that it makes no sense really :)<br />
<br />
I think they were supposed to write &quot; The Team isn't satifsfied with letting people keep getting the Artifact Apperances after Legion is over&quot;. Ion said nothing about not wanting people to keep the apperances, that they have already earned in-game.</div></div><hr />

There is a part of this community which values exclusivity and doing something unusual to get something unique. Blizzard are trying to give this crowd a carrot, which i think is much needed. The challenge skins are indeed hard to get right now, but it is very few people who with dedication and a bit of tranning, that can not get the challenge skin with Argus gear. Even with ToS gear, the many dps requirements are pretty much gone and it is all about playing well and using your classes tools.<br />
<br />
So if you play during Legion, you will have the chance to get the skin. You have pretty much a year to get it. If you can't get it, then you actually don't deserve it. It is a reward for diving into a spec and nothing else. Having people get it in later expansions, where the challenge is made trivial, would be sad and would remove any reward the skin had. <br />
<br />
<br />
And in the end, it is 1 single skin. It is like not being able to get a mount anymore. So not much is lost especially when some people actually get something valueable they can show off in later expansions.</div></div><hr />

Has nothing to do with the scaling. It's a prestige thing. Basically making a challenging reward unobtainable after the current expansion is over. <br />

That's with the exclusion of the people outside those who need prestige, challenge and reward in their game. What about the ones who play this game for skins and maybe that 1 skin or in this case 4 including the variations or well 12 if you include all specs. Doesn't really do much to observe someone else having it if you don't later on. And it's always the best looking skins or models CM sets and weapons, tier 3, removed mounts, elite pvp sets. In order to main in transmogging you have to excel at top tier in other things. The ToS gear is depending on difficulty if it bypasses the dps requirements. LFR gear doesn't cause it's shitter than world gear currently, normal ties world gear and well normal gear isn't even enough to pop some of the shields in some of those fights in dps constantly without cds. Argus gear depends again what level you play at 910 is world gear and i imagine lfr will be 900. So basically if you want them you need to raid to get higher gear. That's highly probably achievable in a year or little less we have if 8.0 is around january or feb, on your main. Then there's 11 other classes needing the same shit or even higher cause you're less experienced and skilled with some of the specs. If that's something the game needs that depends on who we are asking, for a completionist the game already has way too many unobtainable things, they are pretty much waiting to obtained the next 20 years until abandonware private server code is available if even then, depends how long this game is going, might be 50 years until there's a source you can do whatever you fucking want with and run however you want.<br />

Now the most challenging content gives the best rewards.<br />
If you wanted the gear from doing a +8 or +10 previously, you needed better gear than was rewarded by the +8 or +10.<br />
What kind of asinine backwards logic is this? They increased M+ difficulty across the board by a flat percentage and then went back to nerf some of the harder ones but you'd still need more gear to clear it than you would have before.<br />
<br />
Reforging had lots of downsides, such as trying to perfectly get the hit or expertise cap.[...]<br />
Then itemize your shit properly. One plate bracer in all of ToS with shit stats, a second (far superior) one patched out before release. BiS-Legendaries that force people into 4 specific Tier-pieces because they take up the other slots with both the required T-pieces and the Legendaries having bad secondaries. With Legion we could need reforging more than ever before.<br />

<br />
The 1 or 4 or 12 skins are a tiny small amount of the overall transmog system, that will be locked. You might be a completionist when it comes to gathering skins, but then you should be ready for that somethings are not just gonna be collected. If you wait for Argus, you proberly need to have half LFR gear and half normal raiding gear to be able to ignore any form of DPS requirement in the challenges. If you can't get that gear, then you are again not deserving of getting that exclusive skin. <br />
<br />
Again, this is a tiny small thing to give away to the exclusive crowd. You as a transmog collector have been able to get 99.9% of all the games skins and you saying, that that is not enough is simply bafling. If you want a skin, go do what it requires. If you want ALL the skins, do what it requires and get them, but if you can't or don't think it is worth it, then these skins are simply not worth it for you and that is okay.<br />

<br />
.... But then you would change the challenge. The current challenge is not scaled. It would not be the same challenge anymore if you gave people a set item lvl, stats and old talents. They would have to go back and balance the mage challenge every time they buffed some talents or change classes abilities in the future expansion. <br />
<br />
It would either be harder or easier then before and people would get mad either way. Some players who have it now would proberly also complain, that bad players could just wait for the next expansion and defeat the challenge in a easier version, no matter if it was actually easier or harder.<br />
<br />
Blizzard have also told, that it would remove any chance for players to play the way they want. If you like playing with alot of haste as a druid tank, Blizzard don't want to say, that you instead have to play a mastery based druid tank to get the challenge done.<br />

Depends on the player i guess. I've spent 33 days /played at 110 only to get my main rogue the assassination and outlaw challenge skins, nothing more, no other reason to gear that guy up. Haven't cared for anything else in Legion but those skins and then when more skins came out and for other specs those were more reasons to keep playing, until I was neck deep in shit with obtaining all these skins right now right here before yesterday so I can finally stop.<br />
Heck I meant to quit the game and not play Legion at all after WoD, but when those concept pictures of those two sets game I was back in the game, two fucking pictures of weapon models that said get them or life has no meaning.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad someone else picked up on that. This falls directly on Ion's shoulders - this is his job. If his teams are'nt communicating, that's on him. His job is also to look at the game as a while and DIRECT the content creation. Last Q&amp;A he admitted that the lack of content on the Front was on him, because he didn't realize...and then Titan falling apart because of the same thing...sounds like a systemic problem at Blizzard that isn't being addressed well, or at all. <br />
<br />
I don't remember this kind of thing happening when Stockton was in charge. <br />

I do agree, that Blizzard should have set up an ideal scaled character for people to jump into and complete the challenge... But that is not how they went and we have to live with that reality. While i am a person who understands prestige and who wants prestige to be in the game, i don't think the mage tower challenge should be the feature where prestige is focused. They should really have set it as an eternal challenge for players and it would even work as a time-machine back to Legion, when future expansions have launched :)<br />

I do think, that the mage towe can not just be fixed and made to work with scaling tech. To quote Watcher it is important to make sure the cure is not worse then the diesase. Blizzard can change things with the challenge, but they might make more people upset then they actually make happy.</div></div><hr />

But that is not how they went and we have to live with that reality. While i am a person who understands prestige and who wants prestige to be in the game, i don't think the mage tower challenge should be the feature where prestige is focused. They should really have set it as an eternal challenge for players and it would even work as a time-machine back to Legion, when future expansions have launched :)<br />

I think it would be cool in future xpacs to have a mini holiday where the people of a azeroth celebrate defeating the burning legion, and part of that would be access to the mage tower fight. You're right though the reality is that Blizzard is removing it and the people who don't want it gone need to move on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redecle</div><div class="date">2017-08-04, 12:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 1 or 4 or 12 skins are a tiny small amount of the overall transmog system, that will be locked. You might be a completionist when it comes to gathering skins, but then you should be ready for that somethings are not just gonna be collected. If you wait for Argus, you proberly need to have half LFR gear and half normal raiding gear to be able to ignore any form of DPS requirement in the challenges. If you can't get that gear, then you are again not deserving of getting that exclusive skin. <br />
<br />
Again, this is a tiny small thing to give away to the exclusive crowd. You as a transmog collector have been able to get 99.9% of all the games skins and you saying, that that is not enough is simply bafling. If you want a skin, go do what it requires. If you want ALL the skins, do what it requires and get them, but if you can't or don't think it is worth it, then these skins are simply not worth it for you and that is okay.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well i'm on the path to get them i've been on that path for a year now. I just really don't feel like spending a year trying to work for something and then not being able to reach it, that's a year i could have spend doing other things. I started on solely without even knowing if the skins are usable after Legion, which was already a shit place to be, I haven't enjoyed the skins in Legion, I've been basing getting them so I can actually make use of them after when I don't have to wear hidden skin to farm 1000 honor kills instead of the cool one I want to wear, just in case that in the future i might like the hidden skin more than I like that one i would like to wear in Legion. <br />
<br />
The difficulty of the challenges is subsided in the end by the gear, possibly or possibly not on all specs, then I'm to do what i did with the warlock greenfire quest in MoP. I'm going to spend 3 months and 600+ or something pulls of ramming my head to a stonewall until it's done. In the end I fucking hated that questline and I hated my warlock, I still do, if I have to enslave one more demon ever again i'm going to find the dev who put that spell in to the game and force feed it to them, but hey I got a title. <br />
<br />
The bigger problem is that there's not enough time. Getting there takes enormous amounts of time and I pretty much do this 12 hours a day, every day on multiple characters. Still i'm afraid the it's not going to be enough, that it's not even possible to do this in the given time frame. Specifically if I have to start bruteing some challenge tactics with my head to the stonewall for months on end like that warlock, months that I possibly don't have. That we really don't even know cause no one wants to tell us. It's estimated that 7.3 will hit in the next months and last raid tier opens in november. <br />
<br />
Lessons Blizzard learned from WoD was not to dryspell content between expacs, meaning we might very well be looking at the next expac in january or february depending on gamescom announcements. Essentially leaving about 6-7 months to complete it all, when getting to this point has taken already what 11 months and it's not even close there yet. And highly likely getting fully geared towards the very end, meaning it'll be up to the very last weeks of working the challenges. Something I did with the MoP CM sets, I was in there pushing 24 hour days in the last week just to get my shaman set and again I hated doing that, but in the end I got the set. I hated playing the shaman after so really it's bittersweet to have the set cause playing with the class now is just bad memories and source of immense stress. There's no prestige or reward in challenge, only stress. It's nothing but a ball of ugly growing stress that's just going to burn you out in the end.<br />
<br />
Heck the only toon I play to reach pvp prestige cap like mad man, more hours than my main just because eu alliance pvp is so shit, is currently at prestige 5 and needs to be level 15 to unlock their skin and I've played that char now for 6 months out of the 11 to get that far, it's looking like it's going to be mathematically impossible, not much more you can do when you're already grinding stuff 12 hours a day every day. One thing is already sure if I ever get to that prestige 15, i'm never ever ever going to heal anyone in pvp again. If there's something that makes you hate other people and humanity it's that, be a healer in pvp and get ready for apocalypse after.</div></div><hr />

I think this actually promotes the opposite. &quot;I'll quit paying my sub, and even when I come back, I'll be on par with everyone else with AK.&quot;<br />
<br />
I understand it might lure some players back, but I think it would also make people more comfortable with what they'd be losing if they stop paying for the game. I think that's something Blizzard wouldn't want.<br />
<br />
If 7.3 content doesn't bring you back, you're telling me automatic AK research will? What type of players do we want coming back, exactly?<br />
I think, in general, it's better for the long-term health of the game if people resub because they want to see new content, rather than people being afraid to unsub because they'll fall behind.<br />
<br />
I would imagine players who constantly re-sub/un-sub are older players who play off and on based on nostalgia (raises hand). Those people are also probably people who pay for character services more frequently precisely because they have more spending money.</div></div><hr />

I mean we have scaling tech in the game now, so how hard would it be to implement that for this scenario?<br />
<br />
Because classes never change between expansions? Heck, nowadays you can solo most of the stuff that used to require full party at that level, at least the oldest content left. Shadow priests used to wand their way through most of vanilla zones, power creep is a thing people oh so eager to forget. <br />
<br />
People value exclusivity, or what's left of it, in a world where you could be wearing LFR gear while raiding mythic, if you were (un)lucky enough. Is it reasonable to complain that your mage does not have corrupted ashbringer transmog, because you were a druid up to wrath? Or didn't even play? No, I don't think so. Would a Black Qiraji Battle Tank even be a prestigious mount if anyone could go back and farm it? No, it would just be another bronze drake. <br />
<br />
Plus, be glad you have a warning about exclusivity of the skins. +15 skin can be done easy enough, or carried through, even bought if you don't have guildies willing to do so. And when argus drops, you'll be able to get a full set of 910 without ever stepping in to a dungeon, well enough to do the mage tower challenges. Or are you saying you want to get things other's had to work for, but without putting in at least some effort?</div></div><hr />

The other changes looks fine. My Mage is 110 since Monday and I hated wasting my time doing the billions of nonsense quests to unlock Points&gt;34, third relic, Illidan and all. Even without the time-gated content (they're still time-gated, just a bit less than before).<br />

<br />
The team is hoping to make difficulty closer to Mists of Pandaria difficulty than Warlords. There are some fights that are too easy still.<br />
So buff the &quot;some&quot; fights that are too easy. No need to return to the wipefest of MoP LFR that had screams of complaints on the forums. The people who do LFR as their endgame have spoken. It is the organized raiders who are complaining. Queues are significantly lower and runs faster than that of MoP. Todays LFR is casual friendly.<br />
<br />
Tier sets have always been one of the things you can get from raiding. Even if you can get similar item level loot from other sources, you had to organize a larger group to earn the sets.<br />
For a large chunk of WoW's history this has been false. WotLK and Cata had tier gear available to people who never touched foot into raids and since the introduction of LFR aside from WoD players have did not have to organize a large group to get tier gear. The following point trumps all their reasons. <br />
<br />
The team doesn't want to remove too much of the incentive from raiding by providing the same rewards to players doing Mythic+<br />
Devs need to keep shoving non-raiders into raid content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the tower chalenge wont scale at all so yes you will be able to bruteforce most of it with argus gear - but +15 ? i think that 7.3 will be best time to push it because you will get significant boost to output with extra artifact things and 910 catch up will push your toons to +/-920 itlv. (because im afraid with 7.3.5 and opening of argus raid they will bump difficulty and rewards in there again )<br />

He just chose an odd way to express what he was trying to say.

yup - their participation ratio must have been abysmal low in first tier thats why they went full wod-retard mode and removed any incentive outside of raid once again - oh gosh wonder how will it end<br />

also that bs about participation ratio of mythic + - anyone playing knows its straight lie just from the size of how many groups are quing in group finder - they lost at least 60-70 % of players the moment those changes went live</div></div><hr />

this can be so easily resolved for PvE - just make any soaking type of mechanic that can be cheesed a kill mechanic.

Its part of their &quot;tuning process&quot; that they dont want players to have only best stats on gear. Currently class balance and itemisation in this game is worse than any JRPG I've ever played, and developer - player communication is just as bad.</div></div><hr />

+15 is just a color right ? I think I can live without it<br />
<br />
I thought I have read somewhere that the Mage Tower scaled with your stuff (more health). Is that true or is it simply not scaling (in that case, it may indeed become really easy with higher equipment) ?<br />
<br />
Fortunately, my main has always been a SP so I couldn't care less about the Artifact skins. I'd just be a bit sad to never have the DH challenge appearance (even though maybe one day I'll be able to get Azzinoth xmog).</div></div><hr />

I hope this fight is not scaling too much and that we will hopefully be able to bruteforce it with some higher stuff, because I kinda suck with some toons, and it seems like I have microlags on my connection making me fail some encounters (I don't even try anymore).<br />
<br />
The other changes looks fine. My Mage is 110 since Monday and I hated wasting my time doing the billions of nonsense quests to unlock Points&gt;34, third relic, Illidan and all. Even without the time-gated content (they're still time-gated, just a bit less than before).<br />
<br />
Great for the &quot;worldwide Artifact Knowledge&quot; as well. I didn't even think about resubbing after missing a few months, because I knew catching up with AK would be painful back in time. The 4-hour research was perfect, the new proposed system for 7.3 looks fine too.<br />
<br />
Gear surely matters. My first try in the Fire Mage challenge was about 890 (without maxed out artifact, without set bonuses or overwhelming trinkets, and without the Dragon Breath legendary or survival Robe) and I barely made it into phase 2. Some weeks later, I got both legendaries, a better trinket combination, item level of 910 and some points in the last trait (still without set bonuses). After adjusting my strategy a bit and getting priorities right, the boss went down in a smooth way. So I guess, without getting your priorities right, it will be harder to brute force the thing even with better gear.<br />

I actually think you have a good idea with the micro holiday :D But it would proberly need to happend in 9.X before the outrage would be small enough<br />

I think it should be up every time a TW event happens. Waiting a year for some days to get the challenge is overkill if you are playing alts.<br />

Challenge Artifact Appearances<br />
Any unlocks that require doing a thing while using another appearance are being changed to doing the thing after earning the base appearance.<br />
Now you can get your 10 Rated Battlegrounds wins as any spec or appearance.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, does that mean that I will get the skin unlock for killing all dungeon bosses on my other artifacts before I get the base appearances, or will they automatically unlock when I get the base appearances for other artifacts, so I will not have to repeat the process all over again? Or does it mean that I have to get the base appearance for the challenge for every artifact, but don't have to use it to get the other skins, and have to repeat the process after every other challenge skin unlocks?</div></div><hr />

Isn't the entire &quot;locked after expansion style&quot; THE original and most rewarding way, if you didnt participate you cant just go back 2 years later and faceroll it.<br />
If you care this much about transmog/apperances do you not want them to be special?

Heck, nowadays you can solo most of the stuff that used to require full party at that level, at least the oldest content left. Shadow priests used to wand their way through most of vanilla zones, power creep is a thing people oh so eager to forget. <br />
<br />
People value exclusivity, or what's left of it, in a world where you could be wearing LFR gear while raiding mythic, if you were (un)lucky enough. Is it reasonable to complain that your mage does not have corrupted ashbringer transmog, because you were a druid up to wrath? Or didn't even play? No, I don't think so. Would a Black Qiraji Battle Tank even be a prestigious mount if anyone could go back and farm it? No, it would just be another bronze drake. <br />
<br />
Plus, be glad you have a warning about exclusivity of the skins. +15 skin can be done easy enough, or carried through, even bought if you don't have guildies willing to do so. And when argus drops, you'll be able to get a full set of 910 without ever stepping in to a dungeon, well enough to do the mage tower challenges. Or are you saying you want to get things other's had to work for, but without putting in at least some effort?<br />
<br />
Power creep when you're scaled down? That doesn't make sense. If you read my other posts, you'd see that I said your precious little prestige is the date you got the achievement. How do you feel knowing that anyone can go back and get the title and mount from mythic archimonde? If you see someone with them does it diminish what you felt when you finally killed him while he was current content? <br />
<br />
BTW, i hold this opinion because it's stupid to remove fun content from the game NOT because I can't complete this challenge.</div></div><hr />

If they were to have a shared loot lockout the gearing would literally be Aids, i have 1 main (931 Equipped) and 3 alts.

You could use gear upgrades to complete Warlock green fire challenge easier (and clever use of game mechanics, aka special potion), and you could use specifical BIS gear for MoP and WoD CMs. So, I don't mind that these challenges get easier if you get better gear. Especially since they have not implemented scaling to a specific item level from day 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For this case, I would prefer them downscaling the character in a similar way as we get in TW, tuned somehow to the difficulty level of end of the Legion expansion.<br />
<br />
I don't like removing content, and since they have scaling technology, I would want them to use it to keep the content somehow equally challenging.</div></div><hr />

Scaling a &quot;challenge&quot; like this is basicly impossible and requires tons of resources which could be better spent somewhere else. ilvl, templates, talents, current spells, legendaries, tier and trinkets, just way to many factors to make it work. The healing challenge (part 1 which is the hardest part (arguable) for some healers) is already mundane if you just get a glaive trinket from tos :/.</div></div><hr />

:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
The team learned a lot from how Patch 7.2 unfolded. It wasn't clear what you were supposed to do after the intro.<br />
Problem was that 7.2 was really in beta on live servers. The activities were clear enough, the problem was that they were hotfixed repeatedly and players were unsure what was going to be rewarding that day when they logged on.<br />
<br />
Argus has five chapters and three sub-zones and a ton of stuff available right away.<br />
but not all chapters or zones. At least it seems to all unlock in a much shorter time than 7.2, so that's good.<br />
<br />
You will be able to play through the first two chapters on Day 1 and unlock world quests and other world content.<br />
Quest for a bit and then do dailies again. wait for next tuesday for story, cool. At least the scope is much larger than just an island.<br />
<br />
There is a lot to do on Argus and the team wants it to be clear what you should be focused on rather than having many things competing for your attention right away. <br />
I guess this is what they learned from &quot;The team learned a lot from how Patch 7.2 unfolded. It wasn't clear what you were supposed to do after the intro&quot;. They go from thinking they didn't show us what there is avaiable properly to &quot;actually, we don't want you to make decisions, so we're now your tour guide. Please stay on the marked path.&quot; There's tons of middle ground between the two.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many players mostly care about power and would race through the content to unlock the Netherlight Crucible if they could do it on Day 1.<br />
Why is that a bad thing? Why are you not letting those players enjoy the game how they want? Solution: Don't gate the crucible behind the story. Unlock it day 1 and weave what the hell it is into the chapter quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many of the content unlocks on Argus are account wide, such as the dungeon, most of the Argus world quests, travel to the sub-zones, and the Netherlight Crucible. <br />
This is very good news, thanks for thinking of alts.<br />
<br />
idk, this game didn't become so popular through gated content, is all. Whether it's just a shitty end-of-the-game-cycle content-&quot;lengthening&quot; stall tactic or just how games are these days, not letting us choose how to play is definitely is a worse experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why does stuff need to be special or unique? What does it matter or affect a person if you have something no one else does.<br />
Bragging rights, ego boost, virtual length of epeen. Why does anything other people do matter? In general and in a game, specially in a game? It's not like one is here to spend thousands of hours to look at what other people are doing, no you're spending those hours to play yourself. Unless you're literally not playing and watching someone stream a game.<br />
If you want something you get it because YOU want it, not because someone else has it. <br />
If after something is removed someone else has something you don't, well I guess good for them. It doesn't make me respect or admire them anymore than I do, which I don't. Everyone is of same flesh and bones, status is human made garbage.<br />
Same deal even if stuff is not removed, if there's someone walking around in full mythic tier set of current tier or in full raid gear back in the day, don't get anymore respect from me, that required time consumed to get, nothing else, behind they are the same shitty ass human i am, who happen to play the same game i am, for.. I guess for fun, since it's a game. I don't need to feel unique in front of others, I just want to have fun, which transmogging the things that look good to myself not others is in this game. If another enjoys the same skin, good for them, use it as you please. Don't really care if you do it or not.</div></div><hr />

Atleast for myself, and almost all my friends all our insanity to push to the limit came from back in vanilla when you saw people running around with full tiers and you stood in awe with all your green gear and said &quot;i want to be like that guy&quot;, theesedays everyone can be like that guy, just play the game one expansion behind and cakewalk through everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;<br />
Prestige isn't account wide because PvP on different characters means something different.<br />
The experience you have when playing a Rogue vs a healer is very different.<br />
Unlocking things per character reflects the experience you had on that specific character.<br />
If prestige was account wide, you would probably focus on getting a high rating on one character, but what would you have to work towards on other characters if everything was already unlocked?<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
The only benefit to prestige right now, outside of unlocking the initial talents, is achievements mounts and small toys. The gold is marginal from every few times you ding a level.<br />
<br />
Everything about these comments would suggest that prestige actually has some impact on the way you play your class or the feel of playing something different. How do achievements mounts and toys change your gameplay experience?<br />
<br />
On his last comment, that someone would gain a high rating with account wide prestige then have nothing to work toward... all the current system is doing is forcing someone to play one class. Just like the &quot;100 wins in each battleground&quot; achievements. Blizzard can't be so blind to not see that we want to play different classes but feel like we're stunting our progression if we do. This is 100000% the reason why I log in the game and don't play PVP casually. If I'm not working toward something (aka playing my prestige-locked class) then I'd rather be doing something else. PVP for me is simply logging in, doing the PVP world quests (time-value) and stopping. It's sad and unfortunate that they think people are excited about &quot;working toward prestige&quot; when they are actually feeling obligated and turned off.</div></div><hr />

Artificial delays generate longer subs and more money. It's not necessarily developer thinking, but it's business thinking.<br />

It's depressing. But hey - at least they are happy with everything - that's what's most important.<br />
<br />
- They are repeating their mistake from 7.2.5 about content pacing on Argus. Two weeks is a long time for something who thinks they got new content to be content with doing a handful of intro quests and a bunch of world quests.<br />
<br />
- Split raiding could be solved very easily by locking the first 2 weeks of a new tier to personal loot only across all difficulties.<br />
<br />
- Players have made clear they want reforging to get rid of the endless RNG, yet they still trot out the lies that it's too complicated (post hit/exp removal). No - the current system where you have to simcraft on yourself only to find out the item that's 30ilv lower than what you received is better than the new &quot;upgrade&quot;.<br />
<br />
- Damage balance has been a sad joke and struggling specs have been left out to hang for entire tiers.<br />
<br />
- Class stacking is happening because of the inane ability pruning they did. I wager they try to solve the problem they created by nerfing class with immunities instead of giving back the abilities they stole during pruning.<br />
<br />
- and, of course, avoided most of the questions like ilv scaling, no-flying, etc where they don't want to explicitly say: &quot;yeah, well, f- you all, that's why&quot;.<br />

<br />
You're right, but we're also talking about a dev team who's leadership under Ion are obsessed with engineering every aspect of the player's experience in the game, and controlling it as much as possible - what you can do, when you can do it, and the only freedom they allow is loot drops, which have been handed over to the RNG team, because that's &quot;fun&quot;. (It's also part of the addicting gameplay that brings people back, pulling that slot machine handle. Diablo II was based on that entirely.)<br />

Prestige can't be account-wide because different character means something different? So how is raid titles, raid-mounts account-wide? Why is everything else I achieve on a character account-wide? It's always done with a certain character and it's as prestigious or even more than this honor farm stuff.<br />

I don't play pvp for the prestige, but because I want to play pvp. And no, it's not prestigious it's a grind that keeps me subbed. There you have your honest reason, Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

(It's also part of the addicting gameplay that brings people back, pulling that slot machine handle. Diablo II was based on that entirely.)<br />

I agree 100%. they are total control freaks and any time players deviate from what they &quot;expect&quot; they freak out and stop it. Never mind that maybe players are having fun. Nothing they didn't &quot;intend&quot; is allowed because anything players like is immediately regarded as suspect, too rewarding, and has to be stopped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DARE say that their internal testing team is so much stronger that WF guilds <br />
<br />
That's not what they said. They said their internal team is better than previously, and then when they increased the numbers to make it challenging for WF guilds, they increased it too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;<br />
Prestige isn't account wide because PvP on different characters means something different.<br />
The experience you have when playing a Rogue vs a healer is very different.<br />
Unlocking things per character reflects the experience you had on that specific character.<br />
If prestige was account wide, you would probably focus on getting a high rating on one character, but what would you have to work towards on other characters if everything was already unlocked?<br />
&quot;<br />
<br />
The only benefit to prestige right now, outside of unlocking the initial talents, is achievements mounts and small toys. The gold is marginal from every few times you ding a level.<br />
<br />
Everything about these comments would suggest that prestige actually has some impact on the way you play your class or the feel of playing something different. How do achievements mounts and toys change your gameplay experience?<br />
<br />
On his last comment, that someone would gain a high rating with account wide prestige then have nothing to work toward... all the current system is doing is forcing someone to play one class. Just like the &quot;100 wins in each battleground&quot; achievements. Blizzard can't be so blind to not see that we want to play different classes but feel like we're stunting our progression if we do. This is 100000% the reason why I log in the game and don't play PVP casually. If I'm not working toward something (aka playing my prestige-locked class) then I'd rather be doing something else. PVP for me is simply logging in, doing the PVP world quests (time-value) and stopping. It's sad and unfortunate that they think people are excited about &quot;working toward prestige&quot; when they are actually feeling obligated and turned off.<br />
<br />
especially when you get the reward second time, it gives you nothing</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand it might lure some players back, but I think it would also make people more comfortable with what they'd be losing if they stop paying for the game. I think that's something Blizzard wouldn't want.<br />
<br />
If 7.3 content doesn't bring you back, you're telling me automatic AK research will? What type of players do we want coming back, exactly?<br />
<br />
This.<br />
No point in playing untill AK is maxed out. Might as well stay unsubbed.<br />
<br />
Really odd idea. I don't see the point in having AK at all to be honest</div></div><hr />

I think the raid design team was mistakenly thinking the raid was called &quot;Tomb of Soak Your Ass&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything they do has to be looked at in light of how many hours of player time it will consume and they have to skirt the fine line of wasting just enough time to maximize their metrics without making people see the man behind the curtain and quit.<br />
<br />
I don't mind a business trying ot make money but I do hate how some go about doing it when they clearly know its not what gamers like and enjoy. blizzard goes directly against that enjoyment in their design. <br />
<br />
So in creating that &quot;Artificial delays generate longer subs and more money&quot;, I just renew a sub till well after it's all in and I can enjoy it at my own pace and not the pace blizzards metrics decided. Thats not inherently enjoyable.<br />
<br />
&quot;F&quot; that over engineered experience with artificial delays.</div></div><hr />

Oh I agree. Unless you want to gather and cash in on the new expansion gold rush, there is no reason to play wow at the beginning of an expac as most of the gates will be moderated or removed after a few months. I didn't play legion until AK catch-up was in and even then jumped the gun a bit. Waiting another month or two would have my characters exactly where they are now for far less time input.</div></div><hr />

Please Tell that all The windwalkers! This Speck was once overtuned which was Art The Besinnung of WoD. <br />
It got nerfed After 3 or 4 dass with a hotfix! <br />
<br />
Fire mage was op in Legion for over 3 months.<br />
Fury Warriors were op for The entire nh raid<br />
Rouges are op atm and dont seem to be nerfed in and way.<br />
<br />
So that is what you call &quot;Each of The dps speccs is viable&quot;<br />

I mean... The windwalker Haus serveral issues which were all named by babylonius and some other class theory crafters <br />
And still we have Not a Single answer to all the work they did.<br />
