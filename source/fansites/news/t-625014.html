<meta name="description" content="Sartharion (10) + 3 Drakes video by Method 
As you probably know Method did the World First kill of Sartharion with 3 drakes up in 10 players mode. According to most raiders that's the hardest encounter available in Wrath of the Lich King, mostly because it's fairly hard to control 3 adds + Sartharion with only 10 players. You can now check out a video of the fight.

Nothing really new here, but a few words from Ghostcrawler about raid difficulty.<br />
Raid difficulty and tanking<br />
We definitely wanted to make tanking, especially 5-player dungeons and the introductory raids, a little easier. We also wanted to improve the AE-tanking capabilities of all tanks.<br />
<br />
We don't think the threat game is what is fun about tanking. It's a largely invisible and confusing number that traditionally required a mod in order to be tracked. We do want tanks to care about threat (or else they just stack mitigation and blame threat on the rogue) and we want them to care about dps too.<br />
<br />
Remember that the old Naxx was the pinnacle of 40-player raiding. The new Naxx was designed to be more like Karazhan, or even a litle easier, considering that some of the Kara fights (the dragons, Prince and Aran in particular) required a lot of coordination.<br />
<br />
Ulduar and subsequent raids will be a step up in difficulty, and I would also expect to see a lot more of the &quot;hard mode&quot; challenges, like &quot;3 drakes up.&quot; We want to give players a chance to really test their mettle and have &quot;server first&quot; mean something and all that. We just want to do it without shutting 90% of players out of the instances -- arguably one of the coolest aspects of the game considering all of the customized art and sound -- and especially not the first couple of raids.<br />
<br />
If we're having this conversation about Icecrown, then I would admit we have a problem. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13130045504-tanking-too-easy.html))<br />
<br />
Raid composition and upcoming dual spec<br />
It would be elegant if a 5-player run took 1 tank, 3 dps, 1 healer and a 25-player run took 5 tanks, 15 dps and 5 healers.<br />
<br />
It just doesn't work out that way. We don't think we can offer enough interesting encounters if they all have to require 5 tanks and we would have to severely punish stacking healers if the encounters were designed for 5, otherwise you'd probably be able to trivialize the encounter. (Usually we do that in the form of berzerk timers.)<br />
<br />
It's just two competing design goals and we're pretty okay with how it has landed. We did try and make it so that non-tank specs can tank 5-player dungeons, and dual spec will help as well.<br />
<br />
Our goal with dual-spec though is more that you can tank heroics on weekends and raid as dps during the week, not that you tank the trash then switch to dps for the boss. Doubtless players will still do the latter, but we aren't designing raid encounters knowing that players have access to dual spec. Don't expect to see 12 tank fights or that sort of nonsense. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13129955769-tank-scaling-is-terrible.html))<br />
<br />
Itemization and class diversity<br />
It is not our goal to make sure that every piece you can get is perfect for your class or spec. A lot of the game's depth comes from those tough decisions when you're not sure if a piece is really an upgrade or not, or if that wasted stat is worth the other enormous stat on the piece, or if you are better off passing a minor upgrade to someone else for which it is a huge upgrade.<br />
<br />
Upgrades are also boring if every piece = your previous piece but with +2 on all of the stats.<br />
<br />
If someone just can't do their job because they lack critical gear, that's a slightly different issue. There have been cases where a critical item (say a tanking shield) was too rare, or upgrades were too hard to come by (say druid or paladin tanks in Sunwell). We think there is a little bit of that going on at the moment, but not too much, and of course we like to add more drops, vendor items, craftables and enchants and gems over time (and need room to do so). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13129106158-could-we-get-a-statement-on-itemization.html))<br />

Tanking gear and defense cap<br />
I think DKs may end up stacking a lot of dodge and parry just because they can't benefit from block percent or block value. They aren't designed to be avoidance tanks though -- they do have a lot of armor and some very strong active abilities for mitigation.<br />
<br />
DKs may have a harder time hitting 540 defense than warriors or paladins just because they don't have the shield slot, which often has defense on it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13129105916-any-plans-on-fixing-dk-tank-mitigation.html))<br />

Tree of Life and other forms not being able to move for a few seconds after a stun wears off<br />
We'll look at the stun issue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13129065650-resto-druid-bugs-and-notes.html))<br />
<br />
Parry as Feral<br />
These are all interesting ideas. We're probably less excited to make parry into a useful stat for druids just because one of the interesting things about druid tanks is that they don't care about parry. But that isn't to say we wouldn't do it. Healability, damage reduction or some other ideas nobody has come up with yet are all possible too. This one is going to take some discussion to figure out though. More input is certainly welcomed.

<br />
I am realy scared when i am reading this words. Tanking is very easy now. Tanks are able to do a lot of dps, a lot of damage, a lot of threat and they have very good aoe tanking. Most of encounters are about aoe tanking and aoe dps. I can see any cc very rarely.<br />
<br />
I am feral tank and i dont have problem with threat and control groups of mobs. I dont use marks, because they are not needed now. I pull one mob with faerie fire, maul+mangle him and then swipe all group of mobs, while dps aoe them down. If any mob change target, i will taunt him with lame 20 yards taunt (omg lol) back. The same is for our warrior tank.<br />
<br />
This is fun once, twice, maybe little more, but not every encounter. What Blizzard wants make easier ? The game is realy easy now, even tanking. WotLK brings a lot of good, nice and funny things, but almost no PvE challenge and items, which we can get very easy now ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Main reason why i am posted here are words about easier tanking. As i wrote, tanking heroics and raids is not a problem and it is easy (hold aggro, mob control, ...). I understand, that Naxxramas is &quot;training&quot; instance and i think, that Naxx difficulty has been set very good (for me and my guild). Is very hard (impossible) set difficulty &quot;good for all&quot;.<br />
<br />
But when i am speaking about tanking, it is very easy for me after last changes. All tanks have aoe abilities, which works very good. Long ranged taunt = a lot easier tanking. Threat generation is not a problem now.<br />
<br />
I like tanking a lot. I was tank in TBC (dungeons and raids) and it was fun a lot. After 3.0.2 patch tanking became easier. Still fun, but not as much challenges for me as tank, as before this patch. I dont have to care about aggro too much, if any mob will run on healer (dps) i can use long ranged taunt etc.<br />
<br />
So, now i can read words from Blizzard about easier tanking. What they want make easier, when now is tanking almost joke ? I am afraid, that after few changes will be doable tanking with little trained monkey hiting one mighty button in &quot;tanking cycle&quot; ... (sorry for sarcasm)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dio</div><div class="date">2008-12-01, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the changes made to tanking, but I don't like them. It's nice that there is no longer a need for specific classes for certain instances. If you were under a certain gear level in TBC, you'd have problems with some heroic instances. You couldn't just take anyone. Nowadays a party with a healer, 2 warriors (1 prot) a DK and a ret paladin works just fine. <br />
<br />
What I don't like about it is the lack of strategy required. You don't have to mark or follow some kill order, you don't even have to CC. That's a shame, especially seeing they have added more CC abilities for several classes. Threat is no longer an issue, so instances became plain spamfests.</div></div><hr />

If im reading what your saying correctly (and apologies if im not, been doing Java work for uni all day and its been a bit of a mind screw)<br />
<br />
I think you are misreading the post. You're reading &quot;a little easier&quot; and think they want it to be EVEN easier. However if you read the start of the sentence it does say We wanted.. As in past tense, So what they wanted to do was make tanking how it was now, and not any further. The druid and DK posts are just about maybe adding Parry for Feral and how DK have a bit of a harder time hitting def cap without a shield slot. Not that they are planning on making tanking even easier.</div></div><hr />

Me too :( I'm trying to be a tank for my guild but whenever someone says &quot;anyone wanna run something!?&quot; The 3 tanks have to do battle for the 5 man spot :( it'd be nice to say so and so can tank if he wants, I'll go fury.</div></div><hr />

<br />
both of these fights are painfully easy</div></div><hr />

I agree. There was nothing else of importance in this news post, what's with all the spam about random, uninteresting stuff in this thread?</div></div><hr />

That is the whole point.<br />
If you try to keep the drakes alive they and sartharion enrages and oneshots people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But then why are all of these guilds posting videos and claiming that they had 3 drakes up but in actuality they haven't done it? So far I've seen 2 videos of Method claiming to have Sartharion +3 drakes I don't get it... Isn't the point of &quot;World Firsts gloating&quot; to post the video where you kept 3 drakes up for the achievement?</div></div><hr />

<br />
im not interested enough in it to fight my A.D.D. for 3 minutes while it downloads, than load it in my viewer, then delete it after i have skipped all the content to just to see end of the fight. <br />
<br />
if it doesnt stream it doesnt get seen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Like the world was holding its breath on your watching the end of the video... who cares?</div></div><hr />

They are now. They were mildly to very challenging at the beginning of TBC depending on talent when the best people had were L70 blues and L60 epics. If you did them after everyone had geared up, of course you'd find them painfully easy, they are once people have gear and have seen them a couple times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The achievement is to leave them alive, pull sartharion, then kill them after they add during the fight. If you could just offtank them the encounter would be much easier than now that you have to kill them.</div></div><hr />
