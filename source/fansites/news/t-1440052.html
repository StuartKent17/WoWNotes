Iron Skyreaver - Available Now In-Game Through the Shop<br />
It looks like this mount isn't on the US or EU Shop websites or in the US in-game Shop yet. <br />
Bred for war by brutal Iron Horde beastmasters and girded for battle in black steel and smoldering flame, the monstrous Iron Skyreaver suffers only the most fearsome of masters to ride it. Like a blazing comet foretelling doom and fiery destruction, hurtle down from the heavens upon this epic mount to herald your own campaign of conquest!<br />
<br />

<br />
The Iron Skyreaver is now available for purchase from the in-game Shop! Once purchased, the mount will be available to all present and future characters on a single Battle.net account.<br />

Might be tempted by this. I don't subscribe to the whole &quot;best mounts on the store&quot; thing, because my Sky Golem didn't come from there :)</div></div><hr />

I assume the failures of last night made this go live early.... if not..... we literally JUST had a new mount and pet.... this is a new level of bs..... oh well, going to buy it anyway looks too cool to pass up.<br />
<br />
Edit before I get called an entitled baby: I am not mad about the mount being on the store, I am mad about the pacing of its release, especially after we just got a Fey Dragon and Dog not too long ago. If this was a mistake and they are sticking with it, that is fine, however though, if this was meant to go live today then they should be ashamed. This is way too quick for this mount and it is only going to fan the fire that is the &quot;SLIPPERY SLOPE!!11!!!1!!!&quot; argument people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, i will always think that mount themed after strong lore elements such as the iron horde don't belong to the shop, belong to the game. They did the same with the heart of the aspects, that ugly bastard was meant to be some achievement reward from dragon soul, i'm sure of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, seems pitiful that a mount &quot;bred for war by brutal Iron Horde beastmasters&quot; is flying around when Garrosh hasn't even formed the Iron Horde yet. Hopefully this means we'll see beta soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glad I'm not the only one who feels this way. I understand the whole ''mechanical'' theme is not only very popular but also ties in with the next expansion, but I just want a proper flying beast to ride on my Hunter. Not a beast with jetpacks glued on to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but hmm the rockets look a little odd..<br />

Wouldnt mind if they put this mount on IN WOD when we know what the iron horde is<br />
<br />
but its cool I guess.. nice preview on what kind of mounts blizzard ( hopefully ) will make in WOD</div></div><hr />

The mount apparently became available to purchase via the In Game Store on few servers after they had to be restarted due to some issues, leaving time for some people to buy it.</div></div><hr />

The model viewer makes it look like all the toons will lean back when astride the mount which is less cool. Hope that's not the case in game.</div></div><hr />

Uh ... you do realize all the Blizzard Store mounts scale down to lvl 20 riding? Aka, ground mount. WoD having restricted flying doesn't mean that this mount wouldn't be able to be used in the beginning of the expac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because if they made it a Mythic-only drop - people would complain.<br />
It would be made into a 1% drop on the next difficulty down as well in order to be all-inclusive.<br />
<br />
Then the Mythic raiders would be mad. (God knows why, it is a proto-drake)<br />
<br />
Better to just do it like this and take the hate of the people that largely never play. The guys doing the Mythic only content are not going to be incredibly interested in any mounts outside of saying &quot;haw haw, I got it and you don't!&quot; to each other.

Iron Skyreaver - Available Now In-Game Through the Shop<br />
It looks like this mount isn't on the US or EU Shop websites or in the US in-game Shop yet. <br />

Is it on there or not?</div></div><hr />

If I were to buy every mount and pet in the blizzard store right now I would spend 230€. Assuming you're paying 11€ a month with the 6 month subscription option, you could also spend the 230€ to stay subbed for another 21 months. The prices are ridiculous, the concept is a pure money grab.</div></div><hr />

Sure you can buy it or not, and i am feeling that i do the right thing towards Blizzard by playing on vanilla servers Big hug to retail and all Blizzard fanboys that makes me feel more ashamed saying i play a Blizzard game than saying i still play pokemon at age 24.. Sure its everyones choice to buy epic holy shit youre so special youre so pro, extremely fat loser mount, and its my choice to donate to servers..

Well to be honest who didn't really see blizzard staying with this move?<br />
<br />
It's the best of both worlds. They have massive amounts of people that sub to the game plus they run a cash shop.<br />

Their hitting every cash avenue and pay system possible all in one.<br />

It's not a unique model at all. It's using the chimera model that's been in the game coupled with animations from the protodrake (the ground walking animations for starters). Honestly this is a cash grab and they'll keep doing it unless people wise up and stop throwing money at them for things that should be in the game for free.</div></div><hr />

Keeps the monthly fee cost @ the same amount for 10 years even though value wise 15 bucks is worth less than it did in 2005. <br />
<br />
Offers Mounts / Pets / Transmog items in an online store for people that want them so the sub fee doesn't have to increase. <br />

If the game was free to play outright I would agree with you, but we pay monthly for this game and tacking on premium items that should be available to their already paying customers is a dirty practice that people like you promote. People have said this is a slippery slope already in the past and I now believe it.

I'm not fond of the Blizzard Store mounts, because most of them are unique and look great. The bat was the worst offended, imo, as people had been clamoring for a bat mount for years, and now you can only get one by paying for it, while -- before that point, Blizzard always spewed some 'it's too hard' bullshit. As they always do when they just don't feel like doing it. Or it is somehow against their design standards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, stop trying to guilt-trip people into not buying these, just because Blizzard wants to profit off things people desperately want. All they want is a pretty mount. It's not as if they go &quot;Ha, ha, ha! Now we are supporting Blizzard's Pet Store conduct, so that they can continue selling more and more mounts in the store. Mu-ha-ha. &lt;Devilish horns&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
They don't. They may hate the fact that it's a bought store mount just as much as you, but they just want the pretty mount model they've loved since the moment they first saw the datamined model. They're not your enemies, they're victims of a catch-22 situation. They can buy it, and enjoy their new mount, but some idiots will /spit at them, insult them, raidkick them, guilt-trip them because they DARED use their own money to buy a store mount. If they don't, well, then they don't have the mount that they so badly want. Some people have wanted a chimaera/chimera and bat mount since forever. Don't tell them that buying those means that they're filthy capitalists that feed 'Bli$$ard's greed'.</div></div><hr />

Call me an &quot;idiot&quot; because I don't agree with what others say, tell me the mounts/pets &quot;should be free&quot; or whatever you want. In the end I deem what is worthy of my money and this is one of those things. I would have much rather preferred that this mount be obtained by doing a quest or achievement but I'm not picky. If the player base had any real intention of stopping Blizzard from doing this it would have been done 7 mounts ago, moment we failed at that point there was no chance of stopping this train.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to me you fail to understand out business works. If the store doesn't have customers, it shuts down. If people are willing to pay for items at said store, it stays open. Now granted, this is usually because the cost of overhead and whatnot causes the store to close if they can't stay in the black, but in this situation if people don't give them money for resources spent behind another pay wall then they'll stop doing it and said resources SHOULD be spent on the game content we already are paying for.</div></div><hr />

If the store doesn't have customers, it shuts down. If people are willing to pay for items at said store, it stays open. Now granted, this is usually because the cost of overhead and whatnot causes the store to close if they can't stay in the black, but in this situation if people don't give them money for resources spent behind another pay wall then they'll stop doing it and said resources SHOULD be spent on the game content we already are paying for.<br />
<br />
<br />
Apparently I do, because that's the catch-22 I described. Yes, they need customers, but they have customers exactly because many people want the pretty mounts more than they care to protest the Blizzard Store. But you can't blame them for it.</div></div><hr />

Considering it's a Teen-rated game, they're not far off then...I was 13 when I started playing. I'm 22 now, and I can accept the cheesy trailer knowing it's probably targeted at the younger players. Not worth getting upset over it, it is a vanity item anyhow, I think the trailer served its purpose. :) <br />

That's the point though most people aren't hating on people buying extra's for themselves. Me personaly though am hating on Blizzard and people definding the shop like it's their live passion.

I personally dislike the idea of shortcutting to cool mounts with spending real money, I'd rather play the game to earn something instead. In WoD, I'll be /waving to people on my white polar bear mount, and I'll disregard all the 'what's the matter, can't affooooord this mount?' banter, which seems like enough reason to justify their purchase (apart from the legit 'I just think it's cool, daddy's gotta have it!)<br />
<br />
Sure, I think the mount is awesome, but I think it would have been awesome-er if for instance you had to craft a harpoon-net-gun, encounter the flying beast somewhere, best it in combat (example, riding on one head while pummeling the other, and switching around when needed), net it and bag it, keep it imprisoned in your garrison, gain its trust due to a set of dailies, farm mats for the armor plating, and thén ride it to glorious conquest - you know, actually earning the respect it demands (as advertised in the trailer) instead of handing over money and buying respect.</div></div><hr />

This only makes Blizzard seem really desperate to make up for the revenue lost. They don't want to show more updated characters but they have no problem revealing a new Store mount in the middle of the month, despite that one of the devs promised last week to reveal more characters.<br />
<br />
Also, how can people possibly not see that the Store mounts look vastly superior to the hard obtainable mounts in game? The Garrosh 25 hc mount is just a cheap reskin, the Store mounts have all those cool effects, or atleast the Fairy Dragon has them.</div></div><hr />

Seems to me like the Iron Skyreaver being released already was a bug to begin with. As I recall, it randomly popped up after a restart. Perhaps Blizzard decided to stick with it and released the trailer/information. I dunno.<br />

Well there's 2 reasons, all time flows forwards and backwards simultaneously and alternate timelines and realities are woven around each other so maybe by chance these creatures have started to pop up though a glitch in the dark portal.<br />

No. People like the looks. Some people even wanted a creature like that as a mount ever since WoW launched. Like with the bats.

<br />
Considering mounts are purely for looks (aside paying gold for the specific riding skills in-game, which you still have to earn, although trivial for veterans), I don't see that happening. Blizzard isn't that stupid, and if they start selling gear and shit like that, you know the 'pay-to-win' tide will crush any remaining subs...they are a company that wants to stay relevant in business, and are most likely aware of the &quot;pay-to-win&quot; problem that has caused many F2P and non-F2P MMOs alike to fall.<br />
<br />
Mounts, pets, and transmogs I think should be the limits of the store (as they are purely for looks, nothing more). I'm a bit concerned about the level 90 boost if they decide to add that, but it still isn't gear/hard to accomplish achievements being sold. At the end of the day, it is the player's decision if you want this stuff on top of your sub. The perception that you &quot;MUST BUY THIS SHIT!&quot; is clearly wrong.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to resub though lol.<br />
<br />
2. So this is how Blizzard is thinking of making money while the subs bleed out because everyone is tired of SOO already and nobody knows when WOD is coming out, lol, while a good way to make money in the short term, they are pissing off so many people right now they're gonna regret it. Here's my estimate, at least 2 million less subs by the time WOD comes out. They freaking deserve it too, giving us all this hype since cata about getting more content out faster. Then not even giving us a decent amount of five-mans and even less in WOD considering it's for ten levels instead of five. It's a good thing for Blizzard other companies are unable to make decent MMORPGs lol...</div></div><hr />

Turning into a micro-transaction company + subscription. Making all the new mounts go right into the pet store. I love mounts but im kinda reluctant to pay for it. I love putting effort in the gamee for this. Farming the Time lost proto drake sort of thing or a rare drop.<br />
<br />
I am against the pet store if all the new mounts and pets are from out of game sources. Incredible. I don‘t blame Ghostcrawler for leaving Blizzard. The mentality is turning into money above everything else. Pet store is fine for the occasional mount and pet. 2 mounts in pet store in 1 month time. <br />
<br />
People will still buy it.</div></div><hr />

It has custom flying animation and does barrel rolls with jet trails randomly through flight. For me personally, it was worth the $25 I would have spent on 2-3 drinks going out on the weekends. People complaining about other people spending their own money baffles me. The server restarts are either to fix the error with people not being able to buy the mount, or they are going to be removing it from the store entirely. I'm leaning on fixing the bug preventing people from buying it since Blizzard released a video of it for EU servers earlier this morning.<br />
<br />
It's $25 people. If you can honestly say you haven't spent $25 on something more meaningless in life, then kudos to you.</div></div><hr />

I didn't imply anything. I just showed that it's a pretty bad arguement.<br />
<br />
&quot;I can do with my money whatever I want and if I want to let anyone exploid me then that's my choice.&quot; is a quite common stance towards things...as long as you are the one with the money and you get a penis enlargement(of whatever kind) for it. If you lose your job and your nice family-house cause there is some single dude selling his workforce for $1/h that is his right too(and he got the larger peen then cause he at least got work...you got nothing)...but I think you'd not celebrate him and his freedom anymore. <br />

So I'm sorry if mommy won't give you her credit card or your Burger job doesn't pay enough. But I don't have those problems. Mounts on p2win games can cost in excess of $150. So I have no issue throwing $25 at blizz for something I like. I mean seriously how dare they as a company use a cost effective way to generate extra revenue. It's not like they're a business.... Wait.....oh yea.<br />
<br />
What games are you playing that charge $150+ for a mount? Most I've seen go as low as $15 or as high as $40, with most sitting around $20 to $25. Nothing particularly special about Blizzard's price here, it's bog standard for a store sold mount.<br />
<br />
That said, this is a mount I would consider buying if I played on a more frequent basis, as it does look pretty badass.

You can go that way with anything. It's not a fair way to refute an argument. At all. It's not even in-context. What would you say if I said &quot;A serial killer once said something similar to your argument against store mounts or people buying them. Therefore, your argument is now rendered invalid.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
It doesn't work. When you are arguing things, they are supposed to stay in-context. Telling someone his argument is bad because of some outlandish examples of people using something similar as a justification for their horrible crimes is just unfair debating, if you can call it 'debating' at all. Please don't make that mistake again.</div></div><hr />

no game lasts forever and its a way to compensate for loss of subs.<br />

<br />
20€ + 24€ gametime = 44€. You forget the gametime money<br />

Well, then enjoy an entire expansion 90% filled with this kind of stuff. I'm already sick of the 'Iron Horde' style, and that was just because of the little bit of 5.4 Siege of Orgrimmar stuff that had the theme. I will barf my face out this expansion. I mean, I still like WoD, but I dislike the fact that they are inevitably gonna hammer that style into our heads. The Draenei-themed sets that will likely represent a small portion of the new stuff in WoD will save me from insanity.</div></div><hr />

Not a mount i guess but - https://www.pathofexile.com/shop/category/pets#microtransaction-ScorpionLightning 1100 points = $110 No, this isn't a knock about the game cause the game is really really good but its a example of a game that sells pets and other things at high prices. (They also sell cheap pets and stuff) The game is also completely F2P but you asked for a game that sold really expensive stuff...<br />
<br />
They also sell a &quot;Make your own legendary with the devs pack&quot; for $2000 as another example of an expensive completely in game item this one you have to farm yourself so you may never even get the item you make. The more expensive stuff is really just there for people who want to donate for the cause.</div></div><hr />

You normally don't meet people like that in real life because people don't act like that normally. Yes there are exceptions.

This will most likely be a model for mobs in wod and available in-game with different color. It wont sell anymore at that point.

If you're comparing the use of a certain argument by a customer playing a game to the use of a similar argument used by child molesters, and using that to say &quot;using x argument is bad because people who've used similar argument under different circumstances used it.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />

Tha last sentence was very...ehm...mature.<br />
<br />
I sense a guy that buys a mount &quot;just for his own enjoyment&quot; and then accidentally only uses it when he is sure to get attention.<br />
It's just too bad that there are so many people in need of attention that it won't be anything special at all(which is why you usually don't see many of the old &quot;invite a friend&quot; and shop-mounts in cities anymore). ;-)<br />

I know what you mean. I bought some pets when they have been on discount. Aside from ragnaros and the panda-monk being useful at times...it somehow feels like &quot;epic fail&quot; to show them off. Entering a credit card number just doesn't feel like an achievement...and seriously...to show everyone that you have $25 to spend on pixels, is not exactly impressive(especially not with an &quot;in your face&quot;-attitude for those that don't even have that little money). <br />

Frankly, the idea that on one hand they can tell us &quot;you either get this art or this art&quot; when it comes to things like new models and new dungeon environments but on the other, turn around and release a steady stream of store-only mounts (which, by the way, part of everyone's sub contributes towards developing) is just laughable.

Technically, it's WoD content, as that's what the Iron Horde is. I agree though and find it equally pathetic. They're so desperate for money because of how much they've bled subs, that they're just making store content after store content to try and stem the loss of income from the sub losses. I truly think they have forgotten about the customer and now focus exclusively on profit.<br />
<br />
Not only did they take the time to create this mount, which takes away from time to develop an actual mount in game for everyone to potentially get, but they also created a video for it. They constantly tell us they don't have the time to do everything, but their store mount, which costs $25, they have all the time in the world to create a cutscene for. Truly, Blizzard is headed down the drain. Ghostcrawler was right to jump ship when he did.</div></div><hr />

Trailers like that are the reason why I would never, ever list World of Warcraft as one of my hobbies, at least not in front of people I don't know well (job interviews, colleagues etc).

Its not that we are content with it, its that we don't give a shit. Those 15 dollars pay for my experience, which I enjoy, if they want to be greedy as a company let them, as long as I am having fun I don't really give a fuck, besides, no matter how far against the object you push, its going to push back, with equal force, you won't win, you will give up, I gave up, everyone always gives up, just ignore it, if more people start ignoring it, it may go away, but all the whining does is give it attention.</div></div><hr />

That's based on the assumption that they're using people to design the mount that would be doing other things for the game at the time, which isn't necessarily the case. Especially when it comes to mounts, the down time between the need to design them for in game reasons is rather long (between major patches/expansions).</div></div><hr />

All the cool mounts get put on there. This is just Blizzard screaming &quot;WE WANT MORE MONEY, 7.5 MIL SUBS ISNT ENOUGH!!&quot;. As a mount collector I don't purchase any mounts from the Blizzard store, I don't want to because I'm already supporting Blizzard with sub fee, occasionally transfers etc, even buying all of their expansions. I don't wanna waste more money on the mounts and pets. Ir's ok if I spend my money to play the game, but to buy shit in this game seems like Blizzard is moving towards &quot;Pay 2 Win&quot; with the new in-game shop. Because if Blizzard is this desperate with currently 7.5m~ subs may be more or slightly less not sure. I can only imagine how they'll be when WoW goes to 5mil, we'll see a RMAH auction house similar to BMAH which will have heroic items for bids where people can bid on with real money.<br />
<br />
Like Activision once said, they want to find ways to sell as much stuff as they can. They always look for more ways to make money, and that's what they´re doing. And THAT'S what's taring Blizzard apart, they need to start thinking about the players, not only about them selves. Just look at Diablo, they don't wanna have much man power working on that game, cause they're not getting much from it compared to WoW or future games. Diablo is 2 years old soon and it´s still crap. And Beta is missing a lot of things, Beta still needs to fix 100 issues and even then it wont still be fixed. The expansion shouldn't have taken this long, with the amount of stuff in it, it shouldn't have taken more then a couple of months with a decent team, and even could've had a lot more. But it just shows that Activision is greedy.<br />
<br />
Ye ye, tell me I'm whining. But I still think it's the truth. I want both WoW and Diablo to be as entertaining and fun as possible, but it's not fun when you need to pull out your wallet on everything you want, and not getting what you're being promised cause the company doesn't want to spend extra cash. It just shows how much they care about us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it truly amazes me how people are content with their sub money funding stuff they CANT EVEN EARN IN GAME.<br />
<br />
that must be some strong kool-aid.<br />
<br />
By your logic this is just a &quot;reskinned (since you clearly don't know what that is)&quot; Sky Golem mount, and people paying $25 for this are just getting a hand me down. I'm also going to assume you completely ignore that Blizzard has added at least 3 raid exclusive mounts per raid starting with ToT. All of which have unique models.</div></div><hr />

Instant cast, the character can swim for all I care, no art required or anything (maybe some cool afterburner flames at your feet), and they can charge me 25 bucks. Holding onto my cash until this mount comes about. A cool promo video would be nice, too. Of course this would be misconstrued as a total in-game advantage by the filthy purists, so it'll never happen.<br />
<br />
These mounts are just vanity. And as has been stated, they've left the sub price at the same level for almost 10 years. When you have nuisance price increases, people rethink their subs after a while, eventually moving on.<br />
<br />
Which would you rather have? Micros? Or annual price increases? Voluntary optional items do not lose subs and people get to have a FOTM mount/pet and Blizz gets to make more money for staff and shareholders. Win-Win-Win.</div></div><hr />

Q fucking Q. Grow up. It seems a lot of you are just whining because you can't afford it or you don't have access to your parents credit card. Let people buy whatever they damn well please, if they can afford $25 what business is it of yours what they spend their money on. <br />
<br />
You should cry some more, I'm 100% sure Blizzard is going to give you what you want.. Oh wait, they're making tons of money off these sales, so why stop? If you don't agree, at any time feel free to uninstall the game, deactivate your account and stop playing.</div></div><hr />

I am sitting here trying to imagine how a person like that can go through life not being taken seriously by anyone and being taken advantage of by everyone. Where do they live, how do they survive and why don't I ever met people like that irl. I have an easier time imagining flying unicorns tbh. It's one thing to splurge responsibly..<br />
Being broke must suck. <br />
<br />
My WoW account is free. To &quot;pay&quot; for my subscription, I buy the occasional mount or pet. Since Blizzard is directly responsible for my free account, I have no problem throwing some money their way when I see something I want. When all is said and done, I end up paying way less than someone who is only paying the $15 subscription fee. If you consider $25 a lot of money, you may want to rethink your spending and saving habits. $25 should not be a splurge unless you're struggling financially, or you're insanely frugal. But, what do I know? I consider $1,000 splurging, while Bill Gates probably considers $10,000,000 splurging. It's all relative. <br />
<br />
I don't have the new mount, and I probably won't be getting it because I'm not all that keen on the looks of it. That doesn't mean I'm going to crap all over other people that want to spend their money on it. It's none of my business.</div></div><hr />

Adds an expensive Blizzard Store mount in the process a month later<br />
<br />
IMO, working on 1 mount is less of en effort on working on a new patch with new contents, perhaps new gear while the mount is one mount, skin color, lightning, sound, movement etc. all these things they have to do with one mount would be applied to many other things if they would have added another patch like Ruby Sanctum or some sort.</div></div><hr />
