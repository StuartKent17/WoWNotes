New Character Models<br />
It's absolutely not a &quot;too bad&quot; situation, Sutei. I know the concept of us having near unlimited resources to throw at whatever we want to is intriguing, but it's just not the case. We don't have an army of artists on layaway that we can transfer onto a project.<br />
<br />
Just the same, we don't necessarily want to exponentially expand the head count of the art team to ensure a specific project gets done. There's a synergy we strive for on each of our development teams. In fact, we go to pretty great lengths to vet applicants whenever hiring for a new position. We need to know our iterative design philosophy and our core values are shared. So, if we were to hire several new artists to get this project finished, you certainly wouldn't see the results of that &quot;right this moment.&quot;<br />
<br />
Right now it's just difficult to give any sort of estimate on when new models might be available. Whenever a new expansion is in development there are many, many requests for new art assets. We're elbow deep in designing new gear sets, fleshing out the environments, finishing up several new creature models, etc.<br />
<br />
If all of this makes you feel that much further away from ever seeing new character models, I can say the project is still a regular topic of discussion for us. We want to figure out the best way to introduce such a feature without shocking a huge chunk of the playerbase that doesn't really think about how their character's features could be improved every time they log into the game. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216079-question-to-the-higher-ups-new-models/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3941314294#12))<br />
<br />
New Character Models<br />
Nothing about the forums being down and characters being stuck with silhouettes earlier has anything to do with some sort of preparation for an announcement.<br />
<br />
We haven't teased anything on Twitter. Bashiok and I confirmed on our accounts this week that we'd have an update on the status of Diablo III from Jay Wilson going up today (which happened this morning).<br />
<br />
I did mention on my feed yesterday that I had just gotten out of a meeting with Greg Street and Cory Stockton (same as every Wednesday), and that they've made a ton of progress on Mists of Pandaria since we last spoke -- the ball is rolling. Cory also echoed my statement on his feed by saying it's rolling very fast now. But... we're not quite ready to reveal our work just yet. Right now we're locking down the plan of action for releasing new information. <br />
<br />
I'm confident it's going to be a fun ride. Just sit tight while we plot the course. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216069-new-character-models-announced-tomorrow/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3932904804?page=10#191))<br />
<br />
Dragon Soul Trash<br />
If I had to choose which trash I'd get rid of or change, the drake event before Ultraxion would be my first choice.<br />
That would probably be ours as well. We're considering it. I doubt we'd remove it entirely [...](Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216009-skyrim-trash-fix-plz/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3932904227?page=2#36))<br />
<br />
Ask The Devs<br />
They switched to the live Q&amp;A, but then stopped doing those too for some reason.<br />
This is sort of correct. We feel that the CoverItLive platform we used for two developer Q&amp;As post-BlizzCon is a better format. The methods for choosing questions are never perfect -- especially when there are so many -- but CoverItLive allows us to answer more questions much more quickly than we did with &quot;Ask the Devs,&quot; not to mention it takes up way less time for our developers.<br />
<br />
We haven't stopped doing the CoverItLive developer Q&amp;As. There are a couple of reasons we haven't done this in a while. For one, there are only so many questions we can field regarding future content (in this case Mists of Pandaria) before we have to step back and say, &quot;wait until we have these things more fleshed out so we can put the upcoming features in a contextual preview.&quot; Also, we really want to make sure there isn't an expectation that these Q&amp;As will be done at regular intervals. We'll host them when we feel they'll appropriately compliment new information that's gone out.<br />
<br />
We are in the initial planning stages of the next Q&amp;A for World of Warcraft, but its timing is still contingent upon a lot of other things. It just doesn't make sense to host another one right now when we haven't really released further previews of the next expansion since BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
That said, our goal is to try and cover as much ground with CoverItLive as possible. We want to expose you to different development teams at appropriate times (whether it be class designers, UI designers, the art team, etc.) so you really get a feel for all of the work that goes into everything we do. At the same time we want to make sure we get these kicked off for our other franchises as well.

Diablo 3 System Changes<br />
Some major changes have been made in Diablo 3, including changes to the core character attributes. For the full changes post and the follow-up by Bashiok, see the news post (http://www.diablofans.com/news/1059-system-changes/) by our friends at Diablofans (http://www.diablofans.com/).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Scrolls of Identification are gone - players can now identify rares/legendary items without them.<br />
Button '5' is now dedicated to potions.<br />
The Mystic artisan has now been removed from the game.<br />
The Cauldron of Jordan and Nephalem Cube have been removed.<br />
The Stone of Recall is now a button at the bottom and has been renamed &quot;Town Portal&quot;.<br />
The Blacksmith is now responsible for salvaging players' Common (white colored) items are no longer salvageable.<br />
Character Attributes have been changed. We're changing core character attributes to Strength, Dexterity, Intellect, and Vitality...<br />
Character stats are now placed in the same place as the inventory panel and the old dedicated stats panel has been removed.<br />

It's not really the same thing. With the old Battle of Gilneas, Blizzard didn't construct an entirely new battleground terrain map and then scrap it all together. If anything, they had the &quot;idea&quot; of a battleground based on a location already completely fledged out in game, decided it wasn't feasible, and then INSTEAD created an entirely new terrain map for a new battleground.</div></div><hr />

I'll admit that if I see that the number of new pets in MoP surpasses the number of new pets introduced in any previous expansion (and if said pet models aren't used anywhere else in the game world at all,) and if Blizzard comes out and says that they for some reason put Art department people on a project that requires work from the UI and Programming departments.<br />

<br />
Okay, how about this.<br />
<br />
Blizzard hires 5 more artists for the explicit purpose of updating character models.<br />
<br />
How much 'training' and art review is it going to take to make sure that they produce work that meshes well with the rest of the game?<br />
<br />
What do they do after they're done with their highly specialized task?<br />
<br />
Also, familiarize yourself with this saying: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_many_cooks_spoil_the_broth<br />
<br />
Computer games don't really need a lot of people to make them. Increasing the art team beyond the 12 people they have now will suddenly give a lot of people not a lot of things to do at work. Not to mention that having too many people attempting to do the same projects at once will likely result in a lot of iteration errors and conflicts (hence, the linked proverb above). Too many people doing too many disparate (as in, many seperate) things will result in artwork that lacks the feel of cohesion. ANY animation studio will tell you this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it would be easier to test as the area is already in the openworld map.<br />
However that &quot;idea&quot; has already been incorporated and entered testing phase in the alpha version. <br />
So if anything, Battle of gilneas would be more solid than the MoP plans we have now, and the risk of the current plans to be scrapped is even worse. <br />
(Think of the delayed Firelands and the cancelled Abyssal maw in Bliz con 2010)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I like the latest patch for Diablo III, especially the removal of the scroll of identification and changing up the recall stone to town portal. Slightly disappointed with the loss of the Mystic, but the npc was rather redundant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, we really want to make sure there isn't an expectation that these Q&amp;As will be done at regular intervals. We'll host them when we feel they'll appropriately compliment new information that's gone out.<br />
I appreciate what Blizzard is attempting to do, but I sort of wonder if maybe we'd have been better off without Q&amp;As. Us humans are creatures of habit, so it stands to reason that even if something happens at least twice in a reasonable time frame regardless of it ending up later as having been a fluke, our brains are wired to create an expectation regardless of whether it's true or not. Blizzard is going to need to be more judicious in the future if they want to prevent creating a false one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The more likely scenario is that they would hire a few new people to do much less important projects like design a new type of bush and then promote someone who has been working on WoW textures for a while to the character update team. If they had spent as much time actually doing the visual updates as they discuss them, they would be done already. With Cataclysm they had to do textures for the whole world so it is understandable they didnt have a lot of time for character models(this is probably also why gear models for this expansion looked aweful also). I also don't understand how hiring maybe 2 people to make 3-4 new textures per race over the course of an expansion so it will be ready for the next one is so hard. Also I bet more people than they think look at the graphics of WoW compared to newer games and see how dated they are, they just rationalize it by saying that at least the game runs smoothly on an old computer.</div></div><hr />

I think they were referring to the trash before Ultraxion, not Ultraxion himself. The trash is inconsequential... it's just annoying to get through (especially with the drakes that fly just out of melee range...) <br />
<br />
As for problems with the Ultraxion fight, people just need to learn how to push the giant button in the middle of their screen so healers don't go OOM and watch the raid slowly die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard hires 5 more artists for the explicit purpose of updating character models.<br />
<br />
How much 'training' and art review is it going to take to make sure that they produce work that meshes well with the rest of the game?<br />
<br />
do you know there are hundreds of people that draw each episode of the simpsons? how many coders there are at google? do you know how many make-up artists etc there are on the film set for the Hobbit? when a project needs to be done, qualified people are brought in. Their excuse may work for minecraft, but if money is not the main limiting factor here, then why can't there be teams of people that are assigned to design and maintain BGs, dungeons etc and releasenew ones on a frequent basis? Hell, if they let players create BGs for fun, we could do the work and it might turn into the next DotA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, really, the characters models do need an overhaul.<br />
<br />
Currently, humans look ridiculous with their pea-sized heads; their forearms bigger than said heads and, actually, I don't think they even have wrists. Now, considering the complex animations coming with the monk, this could be problematic.<br />
<br />
About hiring: The thing about World of Warcraft is that it has it's own unique style and I'm sure Blizzard take care to make sure that a prospect artist can stay true to that style when hiring. If they hired any old bod then there might be some noticeable differences between Blizzards current art team and the new guy.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, it doesn't mean they don't have the resources in-house, it just means they are assigned to other products - we all know Blizz isn't exactly strapped for cash, but WoW is obviously not the top priority anymore.<br />
<br />
They can keep milking the player base even if it keeps decreasing (8-ish million players is still more than enough to rake in insane cash), put out half expansions every year for 40-50 bucks and keep it going for another 5 years without devoting fully-fielded teams to it. WoW is already in legacy mode, it has enough existing assets for a minimal team to keep recycling in lieu of new content.<br />
<br />
When Titan is ready to launch, we'll just migrate to that new MMO and WoW will probably go F2P - but that's just my uneducated guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game is going down the hole, they're milking it as much as they can alread. Some &quot;vocal minority&quot; asked for some stupid stuff not related to the game and they saw it as a good move to spend their few resources allocated for WoW. Easier to do and with better chance of extra &quot;milk-leage&quot; in the long run since it appear that most of what is currently playing the game is from the Pokemon generation and actually don't care about Warcraft anyways, it's just a graphical MSN/Facebook/Social Networking most of the time, so if they include more common things that ppl like so they can do with while pretending to still play Warcraft, the better. Baseball, Nascar/F1/Indy (why not? We have car mounts anyway), Soccer, Basketball, etc... you name it.<br />
<br />
Yes, pokemon battles and other &quot;suggestions&quot; (including the ones that Blizzard didn't use) that aren't related to anything in the game (except for BS excuses like &quot;we have pets in the game, why not waste resources on a fully battle system that will even need balance and etc.&quot;) screw it instead of implementing Warcraft related stuff and improving current systems and graphics (like models). Remember flying mounts in Wintergrasp? Even the Dance Studio (as stupid as Pokemons, but at least way more simple and actually had something to do with WoW since the special dance moves for each race are part of WoW pop culture)? Nah, too much hassle, implementing Pokemon is cheaper and will keep more ppl playing.<br />
<br />
Their excuses are worse and worse, if during the course of a expansion is not the time to work on new models, and the creation of a new expansion also isn't the time to work on new models, when it would be the correct time then?<br />
<br />
Yes, no answer for that. Maybe if they're cornered enough and with the exact kind of pressure, they'll pull some resources from other products to get rid of that. But not holding my breath over it.<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 is likely going the way of &quot;release it, now!&quot; so they started removing stuff from the game (and maybe including it later with a $$ expansion or, if we're lucky, just a free patch) or simplifying it to release it asap. Activision pressure or not, it's happening.<br />
<br />

<br />
The more likely scenario is that they would hire a few new people to do much less important projects like design a new type of bush and then promote someone who has been working on WoW textures for a while to the character update team. If they had spent as much time actually doing the visual updates as they discuss them, they would be done already. With Cataclysm they had to do textures for the whole world so it is understandable they didnt have a lot of time for character models(this is probably also why gear models for this expansion looked aweful also). I also don't understand how hiring maybe 2 people to make 3-4 new textures per race over the course of an expansion so it will be ready for the next one is so hard. Also I bet more people than they think look at the graphics of WoW compared to newer games and see how dated they are, they just rationalize it by saying that at least the game runs smoothly on an old computer.<br />
<br />
All about $$ dude... all about $$.<br />
<br />
As someone said, WoW is on &quot;legacy mode&quot; alread. So they don't want to spend more on it.</div></div><hr />

HEAR HEAR! Im guessing blizzard thinks most of the player base are uneducated misinformed derps that they cant look up a companies financial information with a quick google search. And to all the lovers of pokewow I don't ever remember them posting polls asking if people wanted pokemon in wow or even any official forum posts where people said pet battles. I DO remember seeing a multitude of forums posts about people asking for updated models for the vanilla races. I also remember adding a comment about the animations for weapon attacks and how the weapons are held. Have you really LOOKED at a female human holding a 2 handed weapon? she holds it like a golf club, one hand on top of another. I race-changed my derp derp looking human male into a worgen female because i couldn't stand looking at his back of the bus face anymore.<br />
<br />
And someone mentioned outsourcing the artwork team. They can do this and STILL maintain the artstyle. its called looking at a portfolio and choosing the work that best resembles your own style and hiring that person. Its called QCing the work they are doing to ensure it matches. OH NOE! you mean management might actually have to manage MORE than they do now to make paying customers happy? GTFO!!??:mad: <br />
<br />
If they make female pandas( not happy i even have type that) fat and bloated like the males are im done. I also dont need another ridiculous looking permasnarl like the worgens have. Pandas are cute and the female ingame representation should be as well. Since human females look terrible at this point aside from a few face choices.</div></div><hr />

As for problems with the Ultraxion fight, people just need to learn how to push the giant button in the middle of their screen so healers don't go OOM and watch the raid slowly die.<br />
<br />
They just need to lower the duration of it or throw trash drops on it, so it feel like trash instead of just something anoying. No need to remove the event (it's fun and makes sense to see Deathwing mocking his &quot;brothers&quot; throwing their own children back at them and later a big one).<br />

enough with the &quot;synergy&quot; bullshit, who cares what the employee's design philosophy is, you can't expect us to be satisfied with &quot;cause we don't feel like it&quot; argument for not hiring an appropriate number of staff to handle the work behind the biggest MMO in the world?<br />
<br />
Yeap, synergy is just lame excuse.<br />
<br />
They changed the original team of WoW more than once (altough they keep trying to make us believe that they're almost all there working on it since vanilla) and the game totally changed. No synergy there.<br />
<br />
I'm not naive enough to believe that if the same guys were still working with WoW after near end of tbc, the game would still change so much even in their core systems and definitions like it changed.<br />
<br />
Half of the game changes from WotLK, Cataclysm and future MoP wouldn't see the light of the day with the original team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Half of the game changes from WotLK, Cataclysm and future MoP wouldn't see the light of the day with the original team.<br />
<br />
Assumptions, assumptions, assumptions (with a touch of /tinfoilhat, no less.) And you know what they say about assuming.<br />
<br />
<br />
screw it instead of implementing Warcraft related stuff and improving current systems and graphics (like models). Remember flying mounts in Wintergrasp? Even the Dance Studio (as stupid as Pokemons, but at least way more simple and actually had something to do with WoW since the special dance moves for each race are part of WoW pop culture)?<br />
<br />
You're assuming that the art and modeling team are working on programming the interface needed to make it so pets can attack eachother instead of the programming and user interface people. Why?<br />
<br />
You're also assuming that creating the dance studio, which would have required creating numerous brand new model animations for every single race (something that the modeling department would actually work on, in addition to the user interface and programming departments) would have required less time from the art and modeling team than something they don't have much of a place working on. Why?</div></div><hr />

I know the concept of us having near unlimited resources to throw at whatever we want to is intriguing, but it's just not the case. We don't have an army of artists on layaway that we can transfer onto a project.&quot;World of Warcraft Subscription: $15 a month - 10 million subscribers - that's 150 mil a month.. 12 months a year.. 1.8 BILLION dollars.. So you tell me why you can't invest money into a awesome army of artists.. Name me another game that made 1.8 billion dollars.. then tell me that game did it year after year.By the way, that doesn't include the cost of buying wow and its expansions..

Some &quot;vocal minority&quot; asked for some stupid stuff not related to the game and they saw it as a good move to spend their few resources allocated for WoW. Easier to do and with better chance of extra &quot;milk-leage&quot; in the long run since it appear that most of what is currently playing the game is from the Pokemon generation and actually don't care about Warcraft anyways, it's just a graphical MSN/Facebook/Social Networking most of the time, so if they include more common things that ppl like so they can do with while pretending to still play Warcraft, the better. Baseball, Nascar/F1/Indy (why not? We have car mounts anyway), Soccer, Basketball, etc... you name it.<br />

See, I don't really agree. Sure, the game is getting old, but in the past Blizzard have demonstrated the ability to refresh it and make it seem almost as though it were a new game. The nature of an MMO, being able to be updated by patches, means that almost all of the game can be updated and modified; can be partially or completely re-written whilst keeping all or most of the player information and achievements intact. Blizzard keep creating problems for themselves in this regard by introducing new features that require a lot of maintenance and balancing, but don't really contribute to the experience of the game.<br />
<br />
Based on the quality of 4.3, I believe they've reached a critical point where the maintenance of everything they've created has developed a situation that compromises the quality of all of it. Recycled boss models. Recycling part of Dragonblight for an instance. I don't think that they have done this because they cynically want to milk subscribers for as much cash as they can hope to, it just seems like they've unintentionally spread themselves too thin. They don't lack the will to push out more, better content; it has just become something that is beyond their capacity to do. And it's entirely their own fault.</div></div><hr />

i'm quite sure if you look at their net earnings, it'll be FAR FAR FAR less than you're kindergarden business math. Also, not everyone pays $15/month.. just a sidenote.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dacia Ultan</div><div class="date">2012-01-22, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they make female pandas( not happy i even have type that) fat and bloated like the males are im done. I also dont need another ridiculous looking permasnarl like the worgens have. Pandas are cute and the female ingame representation should be as well. Since human females look terrible at this point aside from a few face choices.Well, here's the trouble: If the females don't match the males to at least some degree...it's going to be thematic failure. You know, basically the equivalent of that ridiculous expression (it's not a snarl at all) that female worgen have.<br />
<br />
And while I'd argue that the males are plenty cute in their own right, and that calling them &quot;bloated&quot; is base defamation...why focus on the females?</div></div><hr />

All i know is Rift / ToR do not even have anywhere near half the subs wow has and yet rift / TOR puts out more content then wow<br />
Rift puts out twice the content in 6 months the wow do in a year. Something to thank about</div></div><hr />
