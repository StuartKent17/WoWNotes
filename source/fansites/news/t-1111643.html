Spell Changes<br />
Spell changes are here and as usual keep in mind that:<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a beta, everything can change.<br />
Those changes are not official, they're the result of datamining.<br />
It's the beginning of the beta and shit is changing so fast that it's a miracle that everything doesn't explode in our face. A few things look weird, we'll try to figure them out over the next few hours to make sure we didn't do anything stupid!<br />

Ever since guild perks people get their guidies to cut gems; i rarely see people advertise their professions in cata anymore. Its much more profitable to sell raw minerals then prospecting them for cheap gems. Mounts are profitable in any profession really. Besides this expansion will bring many awesome mounts - the jc mount isn't on the top of my life tbh. I will eventually make one for sure but i doubt you will ever see me riding it...out of all the mounts ingame currently bears are my fave.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but if I'm going to fork out 500,000g for a mount it had better look better than what the Jeweled Onyx Panther looks right now. At LEAST give it some unique animations. Or some more particle effects. Something to justify that massive pricetag.<br />

Yup you should know this by now, Blizzard always kill the best things and warlocks are the first target always !<br />
Don't expect to see more warlocks past the first week where ppl loose interest in the novelty pets.<br />
A month past the expansion, locks will be just as rare a sight as they are now in the live game.</div></div><hr />

So, if things stick this way, each JC mount will cost 100 000g, and the &quot;ultimate&quot; mount 400 000; furthermore, if you want the 4 previous ones PLUS the &quot;ultimate&quot; one, it'll cost you 800 000 gold. Well That's a fucking huge gold sink ^^<br />

I'm pretty sure blizzzard does not hotfix things on the Beta unless it is so bad that it makes the game nearly unplayable for everyone. <br />
<br />
Also.. the beta version currently being tested by us is a couple of builds behind what Blizzard devs are working on. Maybe they have already fixed it.</div></div><hr />

Check the video again, this time look at the beginning, notice how it waves it head to the left / right, theres a dragon that also does that (Dont have time to find it right now), that dragon has wings attached on its shoulders, which means that it hovers/flies with the head / neck sorta pointing up while the body is hanging down below the wings.<br />
<br />
What they did with the panther was just copy paste the dragon behavior unto the panther skin and then add wings where the dragon had wings, which makes the flying animation look fucked, since 80% of its weight is on its ass / below the wings, yet it somehow still manages to keep its entire body level = Doesnt make any sense at all.</div></div><hr />

I dont see the point in having tanks have DPS that is on par with the rest of the group. In PvE it doesn't matter, but in PvP it can. Its a player who can keep up with damage and still kill people, while getting a big damage reduction increase and big reduction cooldowns. Lets look at Blood DKs for the past couple of months. Or even Feral. Its not a tanks job to DPS, just to keep threat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The meaning of a word is corrupted with every instance of misuse. It is so with &quot;reskin&quot;, which used to mean a reused model and skeleton with a new texture but now apparently means &quot;has any common attributes at all with something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Original meaning in a correct sentence:<br />
&quot;The Red Drake is a reskin of the Bronze Drake, and the Pureblood Firehawk is not a reskin of a Proto Drake.&quot;<br />
<br />
New meaning in a correct sentence:<br />
&quot;The ettin is a reskin of an ogre, because they both have two heads and are ugly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Very soon it will mean thus:<br />
&quot;The orc is a reskin of Azeroth, because they both are made of polygons and have mass.&quot;<br />
<br />
All hail the new world order.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit disappointed in the demo warlock changes. Being that there's no such thing as a &quot;clutch tank&quot;, since a non-tank spec that jumps into the role when the actual tank goes down is going to get clobbered anyway, the nerfs are pretty much only to make soloing old content more difficult. Boo.</div></div><hr />

Don't expect to see more warlocks past the first week where ppl loose interest in the novelty pets.<br />
A month past the expansion, locks will be just as rare a sight as they are now in the live game.<br />
<br />
Are you in the beta? Have you played a warlock there? Do you have an idea how ridiculously OP lock damage is right now, in the build we are testing? <br />
<br />
Of course they have to tune it, that's why the expansion is in *wait for it* beta. <br />
<br />
Blizzard also never promised we were going to be tanks this expansion, nowhere have they said that. They are aiming for situational tanking, much like a feral druid can pick up an stray add in bear form, something of the sort. Not making us main tanks -.-</div></div><hr />

Hate to say it, but this isn't beta, this is a demo in 90% of their minds. I used to maintain a rule for Betas I wasn't in - I wouldn't look at the content until it went live. I found this gave me more surprises - like riding into Zangarmarsh and seeing mushrooms everywhere, logging in to see druids in the form of trees, not knowing exactly where I needed to go. Friends of mine that were in betas generally were the first people to unsub in each expansion. Since I'm not continuing with the game, it's interesting to see what they are doing, and how the people are reacting.</div></div><hr />

Although beta and blah blah blah, the current icon for the RAF III mount is the same as the Winged Guardian, so you could very well be correct.<br />
I just recruited a friend and was going to redeem my rocket mount when they paid for their 2 months today. I am very glad I came to mmo champion as I'll now just wait for RAF mount III before redeeming.</div></div><hr />

The animation skeleton will most likely not change, if the panther does undergo finishing touches it would be something as minor as making those organic wings looks metallic by adding a sheen to them. Silly mount&gt; Chinese Dragons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not really seeing anything that's proof of that.<br />
<br />
It really isn't that hard to figure out when a new patch file is on the Blizzard's edgesuite servers as long as you knew : <br />
<br />
* Patch files appear to be of the form &quot;wow-update-base-xxxxx.MPQ&quot; (xxxxx = build number)<br />
* Locale related patch files appear to have a similar consistency of naming &quot;wow-update-enUS-xxxxx&quot; (xxxxx = build number)<br />
* Direct download links share a common consistency as well<br />
* Edgesuite server's seem to report a &quot;file not found&quot; error if the patch file asked for isn't there.<br />
* The new patch files will be a higher build then the current ones.<br />
<br />
So all they would need to do is make a script that attempts to download from the edgesuite CDN servers an escalating build number starting from the current patch. Current build number can be easily obtained from the patch servers. The script could simply test for the existence of the patch file for a given build # then move onto the next build number if it couldn't detect the CDN servers had one available for download.<br />
<br />
Here's an example of the direct download links for the last patch on the beta servers :<br />
<br />
http://ak.worldofwarcraft.com.edgesuite.net/wow-pod/beta/0E1FFF21/NA/15464.direct/Data/enUS/wow-update-enUS-15508.MPQ<br />
http://ak.worldofwarcraft.com.edgesuite.net/wow-pod/beta/0E1FFF21/NA/15464.direct/Data/wow-update-base-15508.MPQ<br />
<br />
I think you can connect the dots to download the new beta patch :)<br />
<br />
Don't put it in your Data folder yet as the patch server's still at 15508 so may cause errors if you try to put the new beta patch files in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this is referring to the Bear changes, I don't think that it's bugged. As GC (iirc) pointed out in a blue post, Bear damage was in a bad state on beta. The green text pointing out the changes mentions only the increases in %weapon dmg and dmg constants, but doesn't account for the AP scaling being brought down. On beta, bears were in need of baseline increases pretty badly, but obviously scaling has to be brought down, lest things get wacky down the road.<br />

I haven't had a chance to get on and verify these changes yet, but I think it's a safe assumption that they're correct... for now (obviously).</div></div><hr />

I dont see the point in having tanks have DPS that is on par with the rest of the group. In PvE it doesn't matter, but in PvP it can. Its a player who can keep up with damage and still kill people, while getting a big damage reduction increase and big reduction cooldowns. Lets look at Blood DKs for the past couple of months. Or even Feral. Its not a tanks job to DPS, just to keep threat.<br />

Well there's still no word on if Vengeance will be changed back to trigger in PvP situations, so you don't have anything to worry about right now.</div></div><hr />

I think it's a great concept that we'll be combining the varying gem types to create the Jeweled Onyx Panther; but I'm curious if these expensive prices for the mounts will go live. The individual mounts wont be by any means cheap in their own right, let alone requiring four unlearned versions to create the Jeweled model. At the moment it seems a bit over-kill, and makes the Jeweled Onyx Panther a bit too exclusive for the exorbitantly wealthy.</div></div><hr />

It is so with &quot;reskin&quot;, which used to mean a reused model and skeleton with a new texture but now apparently means &quot;has any common attributes at all with something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Original meaning in a correct sentence:<br />
&quot;The Red Drake is a reskin of the Bronze Drake, and the Pureblood Firehawk is not a reskin of a Proto Drake.&quot;<br />
<br />
New meaning in a correct sentence:<br />
&quot;The ettin is a reskin of an ogre, because they both have two heads and are ugly.&quot;<br />
<br />
Very soon it will mean thus:<br />
&quot;The orc is a reskin of Azeroth, because they both are made of polygons and have mass.&quot;<br />
<br />
All hail the new world order.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit disappointed in the demo warlock changes. Being that there's no such thing as a &quot;clutch tank&quot;, since a non-tank spec that jumps into the role when the actual tank goes down is going to get clobbered anyway, the nerfs are pretty much only to make soloing old content more difficult. Boo.<br />
<br />
You think the word ´skin´ in reskin would give them a clue.<br />
<br />
The phrase they are looking for is ´ omg, it is based off of the model of xxxx´. which is probably true of 99% of the things that will be added in MoP. There is no reason for them to start from scratch for every single new item added to the game.... it is one of the smart things about computers.. building libraries..</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hey Blizzard, this is ridculous, you suck&quot;<br />

Because just taking an existing model, slapping on a different skin and a set of wings is pretty lackluster, when you think about it. Not everything that flies needs to have wings (look at the new dragon mounts outta MoP, or the Horseman's Mount, etc.). That's the first thing that struck me when I started that video; &quot;Gee.

Guys, this is a game...almost not even a game (since it's beta), not a sexual rehersal with the proom queen.<br />
Whining at beta is like whining at Chuck Norris....seriously.</div></div><hr />

Warlocks complain way too much, it's a beta, you will get your mana regeneration to a proper state. As for tanking, you were never intended to tank anything serious, just the same way as shadow priests could tank Onyxia back in the days wasn't really intended but was doable, you just have a bigger chance as anyone of surviving when pulling aggro, that alone is worth a lot. <br />
<br />
As for the mount(s), I think the prices for them will go down considerably. The ground mounts should go for 9k-15k gold max, and the flying one should stop at 40-50k max and even then, most people wont buy it for that price if they're BoE, since they doesn't offer anything special (vendors etc.), except being new good looking mounts. There's way cooler looking mounts in Mists of Pandaria to be had.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, okay. Well, then don't bitch about them. Problem solved. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
We are months away before release. Beta started 3 weeks ago, change will come, and it will come often. Deal with it.<br />
You must be new. If you had any idea about how Blizzard runs their &quot;beta tests&quot; -- or, hell, even their patch/PTR testing -- you'd know that changes like the ones I highlighted rarely get reverted. Play their games and participate in their testing processes long enough, and you start to learn their modus operandi. Just because &quot;beta is beta&quot; doesn't mean everything will always change. Certainly, there's the theoretical possibility, but that's hardly the case in reality.<br />
<br />
Also, you're reading comment and fora threads on MMO-Champion. If you have a problem with bitching, you've, without a doubt, come to the wrong place, lol.<br />

I don't know about your guildies. But my guildies are sitting at 300k-1M gold, doing nothing with their gold. Myself is at 150k and we don't raid anymore, so I will only gain gold from now rather than spend, till MoP go live.<br />
So I will for sure have at least 200k+ gold when MoP go live, and I'm sure that average gold on all servers will go up till then.<br />
Not to forget all HC guilds that are making hc &quot;Buy-yer-shit&quot;-runs aswell. And ppl pay TONS of gold for that shit.</div></div><hr />

I'm sitting on a nice pile of gold too, but as said, I wont buy that thing even for 20k, it's not worth it in my eyes - it's just another flying mount. I got well over 130 mounts already, and that number will just rise with all the faction and quest obtainable mounts in Pandaria. <br />
<br />
That said, there's tons of mounts on the AH on my server, and they're always reposted 'cause people just don't buy them. From Mecha hogs, Vials of the Sands, Crimson Deathcharges to Magic Roosters, Wooly White Rhinos and Spectral Tigers and nobody buys them, I doubt it's market saturation, it's just that people have enough mounts already and there's a yet-to-have mount missing from the game, that would probably be multi passenger + vendors flying mount.<br />
<br />
But that's the trend I'm seeing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone will always buy/get it. There's always a demand on &quot;expensive and rare&quot; stuff.<br />
If Blizzard tuned a boss so hard that you need all gear from latest instance, and 99.99% luck, movement, healing, dps etc. on a fight, ppl would still go for 5k tries on it, just to get the kill etc.<br />
WoW is special, if there is a posibility to get something, someone will get it. No matter what it takes.<br />
<br />
Alot of ppl said they'll never get the vial. Today, half of them have it. My guess is there is more gold out there in ppl's pockets than we think there is. Only Blizzard really knows how much gold there is.<br />
<br />
And pre Cata, it was normal to hear about sums of 30k-100k, now it's more common with 100-500k somewhere, probably more even. End game raiders, probably alot more.<br />

<br />
Feathers From Heaven:<br />
Place Heavenly Feathers at the target location. Each Heavenly Feather causes a single nearby friendly target to gain 60% movement speed for 4 sec. Only 3 feathers can be placed at one time. Accumulates an additional charge once every 10 sec.<br />
<br />
The above talent replaces the old speed increase while levitating one which is now a glyph</div></div><hr />
