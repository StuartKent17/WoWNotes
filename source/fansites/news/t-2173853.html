<br />
Concordance of the Legionfall<br />
The latest Patch 7.2 PTR build added a new Artifact Trait with 50 ranks, Concordance of the Legionfall (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/239042/?artifactRank=50#23578-23623)<br />
Ion alluded to some of this in his post last week, but essentially the goal here is to address what we believe to be the core of the issue with the 7.0 final traits: the large gap in player power it created between players who spent a lot of time farming AP and those who spent their time on other endeavors. To that end, there's four key changes:<br />
<br />
#1: The individual ranks are less impactful. This was honestly one of the biggest issues with the 7.0 design. Grinding out a couple million Artifact Power for a 0.5% raw damage increase was just too lucrative compared to other methods of endgame progression - even eclipsing gear for some players. The goal for the new 7.2 design is that the next rank is still an increase, and you won't turn it down, but it's not your primary focus.<br />
<br />
#2: The rate at which the cost for the next rank increases is higher. In the 7.0 design, someone who farmed twice as much AP as you had roughly twice as many ranks as you. While rewarding the extra effort isn't a bad thing, it doesn't need to be nearly that rewarding. By making each rank's cost increase exponentially, we can help ensure that you're never too far behind even if you aren't spending as much time farming AP. It also means that, as Artifact Knowledge increases, it'll be easier for alts or newer players to catch up.<br />
<br />
As a quick aside, to put some extra context on both of those changes: we always want Artifact Power to be of at least some value to you. It's fine to reach a point where you're not going out of your way to earn it, but it's purpose is to be a fairly reliable form of progression. If you spend an evening raiding, or run a few dungeons, or do some PvP, but don't get any gear upgrades, you should still be able to say &quot;at least I earned some Artifact Power&quot; with some level of satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Anyway, key change #3: The new trait gives a primary stat bonus instead of a percentage-based increase. With the 7.0 design, as your gear improved, so did the total benefit you were getting from your final trait. Changing to a primary stat bonus means it's giving roughly the same benefit to someone at ilevel 900 as it does to someone at 850. Again, the goal here is to reduce the overall power gap.<br />
<br />
And finally, #4: It's a proc. I know anything that involves RNG is often controversial, but this is, in my opinion, a great example of where it's extremely useful. This is for two reasons.<br />
<br />
First, it kind of muddies the waters a bit. When you wipe on a boss at 1%, or just barely miss a kill window, it can be easy to say &quot;if Todd was doing 2% more damage we'd have won.&quot; But when it's a proc, you can't actually be that sure. Maybe Todd needs more AP, or maybe he just got unlucky with procs. Maybe the wipe wasn't Todd's fault at all. Maybe you should be a little nicer to Todd.<br />
<br />
Second (and more importantly), it allows for player skill to play more of a factor. If you're the sort of player who can pay attention to procs and adjust your rotation on the fly (say, a healer who chooses to use cheaper spells while it's active, or a damage-dealer who saves a charge of their hardest-hitting ability), you're going to get more value out of the new trait than someone who ignores it.<br />
<br />
I've seen some initial feedback that indicates some specs are likely to benefit from these more than others - to some degree that's expected, but specific feedback on which specs those are and why is very helpful. We're still actively tuning and tweaking things, so please keep that feedback coming.<br />
<br />
I haven't been a hardcore progression raider for a few years now, but I can tell you with absolute certainty that wiping at 1% due to poor procs/RNG is INFINITELY worse than simply needing a bit more gear to push you towards that kill.<br />
I understand where you're coming from but personally disagree - for me, knowing we just got unlucky means that it's worth it to try again and hope for a different result, whereas &quot;we just don't have enough gear/AP&quot; means we should give up and come back next week.<br />
<br />
Either way, my point wasn't to say &quot;this will make wiping at 1% less painful,&quot; but more to say it's harder to pin it on Todd skipping last week's M+ farm. Poor guy.<br />
<br />
I rarely gamble because I understand odds and know that the house usually comes out on top. WoW is starting to feel the same way. Obviously you need some random elements to keep everything from being completely methodological, but its really getting overboard.<br />
Sure, I can see that, and to be clear we're intentionally keeping the proc pretty flat; it should still feel somewhat reliable even if it isn't a 100% uptime. Also worth mentioning that most of #4 above is just my opinion as a guy who isn't a developer but plays a lot of WoW and gets to talk to to the devs sometimes.<br />
<br />
The issue, Lore, is you're now creating a problem on the flipside of the coin where power gains are so small that they don't seem worth pursuing, and each rank becomes even less valuable compared to the previous. Frankly, just don't do it. Get rid of the &quot;infinite&quot; trait completely. Artifact power tokens now have a gold value, so cut progression off after the 4/4 ranks and the new traits are maxed. Let players transition to getting 1-2% upgrades from gear after they cap their artifacts and vendor the tokens for a little extra gold.<br />
We honestly don't see that as a problem. In fact, it's kind of the goal. If you decide it's not worth grinding a few million AP to get another 200 Agility on your proc... great! We don't want you to feel obligated to.<br />
<br />
We do, however, want to make sure you always find the Artifact Power you come across to be valuable. 200 more Agi might not be enough to convince you to farm the AP needed to buy it, but you're not going to turn it down either.<br />
<br />
Well, or maybe you would, in which case, sure, feel free to vendor the AP items.<br />
<br />

PTR Development Notes - Build 23623<br />
This week’s PTR build has a couple new additions. The new Broken Shore World Bosses should be in, and 7.2’s crafted Legendary items are available as well (although they’re not fully completed, so expect to run into some issues with them).<br />
<br />
We’re reaching the point of development where nearly all of the new content and features in Patch 7.2 are in-game and testable. From here, we’ll be focusing primarily on bugfixes, stability, tuning, and generally tightening everything up. Please continue to report any bugs you encounter and give us any feedback you have!<br />
<br />
To help with stability testing, this week we’re organizing a scheduled stress test of the Broken Shore. We’ve made some behind-the-scenes changes to how our servers operate under heavy load, and so we’d like to get as many people as possible testing World Bosses and the Sentinax assault on the Broken Shore this Thursday at 2 pm PST (11pm CET). If you’re able to come help out, please do!<br />
<br />
Thanks, and happy testing!<br />
<br />

Patch 7.2 - Relinquished Armor Tokens<br />
Looks like Timeless Isle/Baleful gear (Tanaan Jungle). My guess is that this is merely another way to get legendaries, not *the* fix.<br />
Yeah, the primary purpose here is similar to the gear vendors from the Timeless Isle or Hellfire Peninsula. Adding the ability for these items (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/147786-relinquished-bracers) to create Legendaries is just an extra bit of functionality that makes sense for Legion.<br />
<br />
Note that the actual costs of the tokens are intentionally much higher than their final values will end up being, as they’re not ready for testing. Making them prohibitively expensive was just an easy way for us to make sure they’re inaccessible for now.

<br />
Tier 20 Set Bonuses<br />
The currently-datamined Tier 20 set bonuses are indeed mostly placeholder and untuned. Bear in mind that the current Tier 19 bonuses went through several rounds of revisions, and in many cases redesigns, before they went live as well.

Tanks and Magic Damage<br />
Just pinging this thread to say that we're talking about magic damage reduction for all tanks, including Prot Warriors, and how it compares across the board.<br />
<br />
It should be noted that Nighthold is highly unusual as raid tiers go - it ended up with a lot more magical effects for tanks to worry about than most, which has taken a couple of tank abilities that normally qualify as &quot;kind of nice to have&quot; and moved them to &quot;extremely useful on many encounters.&quot; Not sure re-designing tank mitigation based on one raid is the right way to go, and we certainly don't want to make sweeping changes to Nighthold encounters at this point.<br />
<br />
But like I said, we're talking about it. At the absolute minimum we can keep a better handle on it for Tomb of Sargeras.

No, we are going to study the logs, see hat procced and we are going to say &quot;We wiped at 1% due to RNG. Thank you Blizz for adding more RNG.&quot; In the other case increasing Todd's DPS is a certain and achievable goal. With RNG you just shoot at it until you get lucky, which is incredibly frustrating and adds one more layer of bad experience. There's already several such layers and all due to RNG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, we all knew a garrison type thing would remain. It was dipping the toe into &quot;housing&quot; and they liked the mission table idea (we all did, honestly), as it keeps you logging in for that and if you log in for that, you'll probably end up doing other things as well. <br />
<br />
Artifacts i think are a bit different, they are literally the more powerful weapons that a spec has, so use having to &quot;join them together&quot; to close a portal to Argus means we'll have to forge new weapons of power going forward. Kinda sucks, makes perfect sense.... but it can easily be viewed as artifacts 2.0.</div></div><hr />

When you have a yacht and 2 women under the table you will reevaluate your life and your goals, trust me. Money is everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, actually, you would indeed finish twice as fast; it's just that with exponential growth, the other person wouldn't have half of your trait count, they'd be closer to 90%+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
true that... when i see an enhancement shaman with 15 ilvl less than i have but still having (i had 26) 54 proccs of stormbringer... i guess im just unlucky right... especially when i have in the rekill 23 proccs...<br />
<br />
oh and not to mention: grinding old content (emerald nightmare) for bis relics and hopefully seeing those procc above 890 im really happy, that legion isnt based on random luck! <br />
<br />
holy shit... blizz... you did such a fucking messy job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really no. Gear lasted for longer spans of time from Vanilla to the end of TBC. Mind you I do love that content comes out faster it just makes it harder for casuals to enjoy.</div></div><hr />

I know many will not like it, but if you know how to track buffs this is a welcomed change and doesn't shit on those who are behind or have main switched.<br />
<br />
As a feral druid the last thing I need is a random proc that I have zero control over that's going to make my DPS wildly fluctuate as there's no way to time my bleeds around the proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;You can't be mad at someone if it's random, right? Not their fault.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, it's still someone's fault: The joker who kept shoving RNG down everyone's throats.<br />
<br />
Maybe RNG is the solution to faction imbalance. &quot;Damn, I tried to make a troll death knight and the game gave me a gnome hunter. Oh well guess I'll play it.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Meters are usually the first place they look. So if Todd is in the bottom percent of the damage done they're not going to care if he did or didn't do M+. They're going to care that Todd didn't do enough damage</div></div><hr />

It's just a goofy - it's a goofy fucking name, OK? Hi, what's your name?<br />
Todd. I'm Todd. And this is Blake, and Blaire and Blaine and Brent. Where all these goofy fucking boys names coming from?! Taylor, Tyler, Jordan, Flynn. These are not real names! You want to hear a real name? Eddie. Eddie is a real name, whatever happened to Eddie, he was here a minute ago. Joey and Jackie and Johnny and Phil. Bobby and Tommy and Danny and Bill, what happened? Todd. And Cody, and Dylan, and Cameron, and Tucker<br />
Hi Tucker, I'm Todd. Hi Todd, I'm Tucker. Fuck Tucker, Tucker sucks. And fuck Tucker's friend, Kyle. that's another soft name for a boy, Kyle. Soft names make soft people. I'll bet you anything that ten times out of ten, Nicky, Vinnie, and Tony would beat the shit out of Todd, Kyle, and Tucker&quot;<br />

They're trying to control how players play the game. Problem is, they've tried this before, they know how tunnel vision and stubborn their players can be - especially the top tier raiders. They know that group will do anything they can to avoid that 1%. That's why they force their players to farm endlessly, to get the last point of dps out of every dpser. If they can't blame one thing, they'll find another.<br />
<br />
And Todd? If his proc is that important, they'll just bench him for a player/class that has better odds of a proc, or isn't impacted as greatly. They know how these kind of players operate, and they know they'll cheese their dps any way they can, even if it means forcing all of their DPS to reroll one class. If a class is causing issues like this - that class won't make the cut anymore. <br />
<br />
So I don't see how this will solve anything.</div></div><hr />

1.blizzard knows the nolifers will still farm AP<br />
2. and what do they need? more M+ keys. <br />
3. who has M+ keys ? casuals.<br />
4. who pays for m+/raid carries (now that every key/dungeon is worth the same ap) ? casuals<br />
5. who buys gold from the auctionhouse? casuals<br />
6. ????<br />

Fuck this Todd guy!<br />
If Todd can't be bothered to meet the raids expectations he can find a guild with like-minded Todds and raid with them!<br />
Guilds decide on their own what kind of team they want to build, and there are guilds catering to all types of players!<br />
If you have a lot of time to play and want to push progress fast, there is a guild for you!<br />
If you have 8 kids and 2 jobs, there is a guild for you!<br />
If all you want to do is pet battles and meme spam in /g, there is a guild for you!<br />
Stop trying to trojan horse Todd into a raid he doesnt belong by obfuscating player input and output!<br />
What even is this reasoning by blizzard?!<br />
TODD. GTFO.<br />
