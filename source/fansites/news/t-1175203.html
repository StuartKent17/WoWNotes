Players and Friends,<br />
<br />
Even when you are in the business of fun, not every week ends up being fun. This week, our security team found an unauthorized and illegal access into our internal network here at Blizzard. We quickly took steps to close off this access and began working with law enforcement and security experts to investigate what happened.<br />
<br />
At this time, we’ve found no evidence that financial information such as credit cards, billing addresses, or real names were compromised. Our investigation is ongoing, but so far nothing suggests that these pieces of information have been accessed.<br />
<br />
Some data was illegally accessed, including a list of email addresses for global Battle.net users, outside of China. For players on North American servers (which generally includes players from North America, Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia) the answer to the personal security question, and information relating to Mobile and Dial-In Authenticators were also accessed. Based on what we currently know, this information alone is NOT enough for anyone to gain access to Battle.net accounts.<br />
<br />
We also know that cryptographically scrambled versions of Battle.net passwords (not actual passwords) for players on North American servers were taken. We use Secure Remote Password protocol (SRP) to protect these passwords, which is designed to make it extremely difficult to extract the actual password, and also means that each password would have to be deciphered individually. As a precaution, however, we recommend that players on North American servers change their password. Please click this link to change your password (https://battle.net/account/management/settings/change-password.html). Moreover, if you have used the same or similar passwords for other purposes, you may want to consider changing those passwords as well.<br />
<br />
In the coming days, we'll be prompting players on North American servers to change their secret questions and answers through an automated process. Additionally, we'll prompt mobile authenticator users to update their authenticator software. As a reminder, phishing emails will ask you for password or login information. Blizzard Entertainment emails will never ask for your password. We deeply regret the inconvenience to all of you and understand you may have questions. Please find additional information here (http://battle.net/support/en/article/6327).<br />
<br />
We take the security of your personal information very seriously, and we are truly sorry that this has happened.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
Mike Morhaime <br />
<br />
<br />
Important Security Update FAQ<br />
Is there anything that players need to do right now to protect themselves?<br />
While there is currently no evidence that any of the password or player data has been misused, we encourage our North American players to change their passwords. Click here (https://battle.net/account/management/settings/change-password.html) to login and change your password.<br />
<br />
In the coming days we will implement an automated process for all users to change their secret questions and answers, as a precautionary measure. We'll also prompt mobile authenticator users to update their authenticator software.<br />
<br />
Additionally, while Blizzard has no indication that any of your information was shared with any other unauthorized parties or that there has been any unauthorized use of your data, we urge all members of our community to closely monitor all of their online accounts. <br />
<br />
Players should also be wary of fraudulent emails (phishing). Unfortunately, because email addresses were exposed, it is entirely possible that this could result in an increased, targeted phishing campaign being sent to our users. Check this page for tips on how to spot and avoid these types of fraudulent emails.<br />
<br />
What data was affected?<br />
Here's a summary of the data that we know was illegally accessed:<br />
<br />
North American-based accounts, including players from Latin America, Australia, New Zealand, and Southeast Asia:<br />
<br />
Email addresses<br />
Answers to secret security questions<br />
Cryptographically scrambled versions of passwords (not actual passwords)<br />
Information associated with the Mobile Authenticator<br />
Information associated with the Dial-in Authenticator<br />
Information associated with Phone Lock, a security system associated with Taiwan accounts only<br />
<br />
<br />
Accounts from all global regions outside of China (including Europe and Russia):<br />
<br />
Email addresses<br />
<br />
<br />
China-based accounts:<br />
<br />
Unaffected<br />
<br />
<br />
At this time, there’s no evidence that financial information of any kind has been accessed. This includes credit cards, billing addresses, names, or other payment information. <br />
<br />
What information related to Mobile and Dial-In Authenticators was exposed? What about Phone Lock?<br />
With regard to Dial-In Authenticators, hashed (not actual) phone numbers were accessed. This is phone data from the relatively small number of people who opted into the program.<br />
<br />
With regard to Mobile Authenticators, information was taken that could potentially compromise the integrity of North American Mobile Authenticators. We have no evidence that other regions were affected. We are working quickly to provide software updates to users.<br />
Additionally we believe the integrity of the physical authenticators remains intact.<br />
<br />
The information relating to Phone Lock represents a small number of hashed (not actual) phone numbers from Taiwanese players who opted into this service and had a North American Battle.net account.<br />
<br />
Was the physical authenticator compromised?<br />
We believe the integrity of the physical authenticators remains intact.<br />
<br />
How did this happen?<br />
Like all companies doing business online, it is not an uncommon occurrence to experience outside parties trying to illegitimately gain access to the operation’s structure at some level. We are continually upgrading our security technologies, policies, protocols and procedures to protect our customers and our games against the threats that increasingly arise in today’s online world.<br />
<br />
When did Blizzard learn of the unauthorized access?<br />
The trespass into our internal network was detected by us on August 4, 2012.<br />
<br />
Why did Blizzard announce this on August 9?<br />
We worked around the clock since we discovered the unauthorized user to determine the nature of the trespass and understand what data was accessed. Our first priority was to re-secure our network, and from there we worked simultaneously on the investigation and on informing our global player base. We wanted to strike a balance between speed and accuracy in our reporting and worked diligently to serve both equally important needs.<br />
<br />
What action has Blizzard taken?<br />
Upon learning of the unauthorized access, we worked quickly to re-secure our network. Afterward, we immediately notified law enforcement as well as security experts and launched an ongoing investigation to determine what had occurred. We also took steps to notify players, which happened in a matter of days from the time we discovered the illegal access. <br />
<br />
Was any personal or financial information accessed?<br />
At this time, there is no evidence that financial information was affected or accessed. There's also no evidence that personal information such as real names or billing addresses were accessed.<br />
<br />
What can you tell us about the scrambled passwords that were accessed?<br />
Cryptographically scrambled versions of passwords for North American players were accessed, protected by Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol. This information alone doesn't give unauthorized users the actual passwords -- each password would need to be deciphered individually. The added layer of protection from SRP makes that process computationally very difficult and expensive.<br />
<br />
Why not immediately invalidate the secret questions and answers that were compromised?<br />
This was a difficult decision to make but in the end we believe that keeping the secret questions and answers in place still provides a layer of security against unauthorized users who don't have access to the compromised data. In the meantime, we are working quickly to create a mechanism for players to change the secret question and answer on their account. Our customer service staff will also know to use additional measures to verify player identities and not rely solely on secret question and answer.<br />
<br />
Why not immediately revoke the mobile authenticators?<br />
Similar to the decision surrounding secret question and answer, we still believe that keeping mobile authenticators active provides a layer of security against unauthorized users who don't have access to the compromised data. In fact, the mobile authenticator information by itself won't grant access to a Battle.net account -- that still requires the actual password as well. We are working quickly to deploy new mobile authenticator software and will notify players to update as soon as it's available.<br />
<br />
Are you taking additional security measures as a result of this occurrence?<br />
We are continually upgrading our security technologies, policies, protocols and procedures to help protect our customers and our games, and will continue to monitor the situation closely.<br />
<br />
Teams have also been working around the clock in an ongoing investigation with law enforcement and security experts, to gain a more detailed understanding of what happened. As we conclude the investigation there will be lessons learned that can help strengthen our security going forward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Authenticator doesn't mean crap if they got the serial numbers for each account(Which they did) and the algorithm for the random number generator that the battle.net authenticator uses.<br />
<br />
With this information your authenticator will be USELESS, since they can write third party software, plug in Serial numbers and just get the same code your authenticator would produce.<br />
<br />
basically, go unpair your authenticator, generate a new serial, repair it and change your pass word<br />
<br />
and then go to EVERY SINGLE WEBSITE you use your battle.net e-mail in association with that uses the same pass word and change all THOSE pass words too</div></div><hr />

<br />
No they really aren't. It's difficult but not impossible to do, and the authenticator code you CAN get with a man-in-the-middle attack is very time-sensitive. Banks and other places use this type of authentication for a reason.<br />
<br />
Nothing online is truly unhackable, but an Authenticator makes is very much harder.</div></div><hr />

lol nice statement, now please provide evidence? I've never seen an example of a hacked authenticator account, ignoring retards who let their phones be hacked.

Not as common as you make it out to be.<br />
<br />
On top of that, this is what happens when Blizzard is hacked. Nothing swept under the rug. I wonder what the conspiracy nuts are going to say now.</div></div><hr />

He can't because they're not. Authenticators are bank-level security and people who would be able to hack these have a lot better things to do than steal your game account. Such as becoming multi-millionaires and fleeing to some island with no extradition treaties.</div></div><hr />

There's no way in hell they'd be able to hide that from whatever security experts they've brought in to help with this. They'd be in so much trouble legally if they tried to hide it. So I think it's pretty safe to say that your credit card will be fine.</div></div><hr />

Always adorable when people who haven't a clue about something try to make it out otherwise. FYI, authenticators are extremely difficult and time consuming to hack, and the only known &quot;hack&quot; requires a great deal of timing and far more information than an ordinary account would. It usually just isn't worth the effort, and it's not like someone can target your account and go &quot;herp derp, he has nice stuff, I want to hack his authenticated account&quot;. It's an EXTREMELY specific and unlikely series of events that has to transpire, with you giving the hackers the exact info they require to do the hack, before it's even possible for them to do.</div></div><hr />

I can answer this question with a high degree of confidence.<br />
<br />
Reused passwords from a breach in another service was used to access an account on Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Access into the admin systems were gained, and seed information for the authenticators was stored there and accessed as well.<br />
<br />
This was most likely not a 'hack' per se, but rather that one (or multiple) employees were simply insecure and the system was breached through the front door.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard states it here<br />
<br />
<br />
Why not immediately revoke the mobile authenticators?<br />
Similar to the decision surrounding secret question and answer, we still believe that keeping mobile authenticators active provides a layer of security against unauthorized users who don't have access to the compromised data. In fact, the mobile authenticator information by itself won't grant access to a Battle.net account -- that still requires the actual password as well. We are working quickly to deploy new mobile authenticator software and will notify players to update as soon as it's available.<br />
<br />
This means if they unencrypt the passwords, and then use a legitimate 3rd party authenticator like Winauth, they could plug in the serial number of your Auth and gain access. Simple as that after they break the encryption to the passwords.</div></div><hr />

For that network to allow you to login it has to have some remote access capability. How do you expect to be able to use your password to login if the server can't access your password to validate it?<br />
<br />
They can't do more than they are doing. All data has to be read at some point so it needs to be readable some way or another. It's encrypted as well as it can be to still be usable. However, someone has to write the encryption in the first place; And if one person can write it, someone else can crack it.<br />

That's just how it is.</div></div><hr />

By the time they've unencrypted it the software update will be out and make it all a null point anyway.<br />

There is a reason banks use the same system. It takes ages to crack and by the time it is the breach has been detected and a fix applied. Breaches will obviously happen, they'll just very very rarely involve anything useful being obtained before it's been made useless by updates.</div></div><hr />

Don't waste your breath. I've been trying to explain that to people for years now and they still don't listen.

<br />
With this information your authenticator will be USELESS, since they can write third party software, plug in Serial numbers and just get the same code your authenticator would produce.<br />
<br />
basically, go unpair your authenticator, generate a new serial, repair it and change your pass word<br />
<br />
and then go to EVERY SINGLE WEBSITE you use your battle.net e-mail in association with that uses the same pass word and change all THOSE pass words too<br />

<br />
It depends. The passwords must still be hashed in a predermined form, you can't have &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;FOO&quot; and expect them to hash to the same (which they won't). So they internally convert it before storing the hashed password. The problem is that no one else knows how they convert it, chances are they convert all password the same though (all upper/lower).. which would be bad as there would be a lot less combinations, also once you found out one you could more easily find out the rest (probably).<br />
<br />
But if they've been smart about it and based the conversion on something non-static, maybe an internal number (every X chars should be upper case) that varies for different accounts they can still maintain almost the same level of security from a hacking point of view as case sensitive passwords.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No credit cards, billing info, personal information was stolen. So they have email addresses and an encrypted password database which will take quite some time to crack each individual password. I think Blizzard covered their ass pretty well with technology here. <br />
<br />
By the time they are able to start compromising accounts, forced password changes will happen. That's assuming they don't have an authenticator which means they are sol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now if both of those items were indeed breached, then yes. Unlink your authenticator and generate a new one!<br />
<br />
In fact, I'd do it anyway. All you need to remove an authenticator from someone's account is their secret word, and the serial to the authenticator. Now, you just crack that password, and now you have their account.</div></div><hr />

Less than a week. You don't notify your customers until you are 100% sure about the extent of the hack. Once you find an intrusion you research exactly what happened, what was compromised, etc. What's the point of alerting customers and then sending another notice saying oops, we discovered more was hacked.</div></div><hr />

Good job, everyone. At handling this situation like adults. I'm so proud. &lt;3<br />
<br />
Everything on the D3 forums is a big pile of derp. On to the topic at hand, that's why it's better to use one email address for your battle.net account separate from your real or &quot;main&quot; email address. It's also better to have a credit card and not a debit/check card that has direct access to your funds on your bank account. You can do one better and use time cards instead.</div></div><hr />

How do you expect to be able to use your password to login if the server can't access your password to validate it?<br />
<br />
They can't do more than they are doing. All data has to be read at some point so it needs to be readable some way or another. It's encrypted as well as it can be to still be usable. However, someone has to write the encryption in the first place; And if one person can write it, someone else can crack it.<br />
<br />
That's just how it is.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I appreciate that. But that's a single user asking for authentication to their single account. To get access to so much information at once though, seems to be a much harder job?</div></div><hr />

Blizzard states it here<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This means if they unencrypt the passwords, and then use a legitimate 3rd party authenticator like Winauth, they could plug in the serial number of your Auth and gain access. Simple as that after they break the encryption to the passwords.<br />
<br />
They can blacklist all the current serials being used for the mobile authenticators. Then issue a software update which forces you to login to your account management page to receive a newly issued serial to plug into your authenticator. <br />
<br />
If someone does manage to crack your password before you reset it your authenticator number will be wrong when they try to login.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best thing you can do is hope to update your password safely and then if they do bust the Auths they will run into a new password that they wont be able to access(hopefully). <br />
<br />
Going to be interesting how this plays out, very poor timing for Blizzard with the expansion just around the corner. Lots of people are not playing so might not even be aware this is occuring and if it plays out poorly, a lot of players could get their accounts taken.<br />
<br />
I hope nothing happens too bad, but it is worrying that even Blizzard who are quite meticulous about security are being invaded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A good company doesn't store your full credit card number, only the first 4 (which determines which company the credit card came from) and the last 4. Instead when you type in the credit card number, the company gets a merchant number for your credit card from the credit card company. This number allows them to charge your card while limiting the what and where charges to your credit card come from. Additionally, if a security breach occurs they can simply invalidate their own code which means you don't need to get a new credit card, you simply have to type in your card number again when you use it.</div></div><hr />

I hardly ever say this on a forum, let alone Real Life, but... geez take a chill pill. Five days is actually pretty dang good, especially compared to other significant security breaches with other companies in the past.<br />
<br />
And of course they'd fix security first. Think about it: Would you announce to the world that you've got a hole in security that is still open? If you did, they may as well just say &quot;Come on in, we want all the hackers in the world to basically rape us of our data.&quot;<br />

Blizzard is a massive company, so things like this can happen. There's no point in whining about it. Every large company has problems like this once in a blue moon.

This issue here, would have happened no matter what, I imagine, but I'll still appalled. I expected more of Blizzard, since, like many of you, I trusted them with my information. I don't want assurances, and I'll accept that I have to change up my information.. but all I really want is to see them go after the people responsible, legally, like the wrath of God coming down on the heretics. That is the only apology that will satisfy me. I want the punishment of those responsible to be so severe and resonating that others will think twice, though, obviously, nothing will sway the truly ambitious.</div></div><hr />

Why would you ever support a group of people who intentionally hack and steal personal data from companies and then release it on the internet or sell it to third parties? Just because they have lulz in their name? Because they claim they're &quot;fighting the man&quot; or whatever? Give me a break. The only people they hurt are consumers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, surprised this hasn't happened sooner, frankly. Glad to know they at least encrypt their passwords, unlike some other companies that have gotten hacked in the last year or two.<br />

You played on a different computer before that though. They could've gotten your password from that.<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
<br />
About the same time last summer watched as other people also get hacked at the same time as me.... ever noticed the hacks come in waves? like all the sudden you see a few thousand people get hacked in a week, then its quiet for a month, then it happens again, hmmmmm....... almost like some one is getting a HUGE LONG list of screen names and passwords from a special source of screen names and passwords??????<br />
Lots and lots of people use the same email/username, and the same password as well, in many different games or websites.<br />
When one game/website gets hacked, the hackers then have a long list of those usernames/passwords, and they ARE going to try them out on other games/websites as well.<br />
If people used the same login information in a game that got hacked, as they do in WoW, it isn't Blizzard's security at fault if their WoW account then gets hacked later.</div></div><hr />

What exactly would they say? Handling this type of issue isn't as simple as just running up and yelling THE SKY IS FALLING, RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! We want to know which part of the sky is falling. The point is that you need to have your information ready to handle the people who will be ready to jump up and say their credit card information got stolen so they are going to sue. When it comes to people on the Internet &quot;Expect the worst but be prepared for the best&quot;.</div></div><hr />

There have been companies, MMO's in particular, who didn't say anything for months. Blizz has probably taken the last 5 days finding out exactly what got compromised to let us know what we need to do.</div></div><hr />

Friend lost 100 euros about 2 years ago because of Blizzard somehow managed to lose his credit card info. A credit card gotten 2 days prior to only buy WoW subscription time online, from Blizzards website. And there's people that lost several hundreds, even thousands of dollars/ euros because of Blizzard.

Keep in mind, that login information to get access to your ingame account is not the only valuable information I could find, if I had direct access to blizzards databases. Despite the obvious payment data, even contact data, such es name tied to email address and real address, maybe even phone number sell for a good amount of money. Stealing those information might not harm your character or your bank account, but it harms your privacy.</div></div><hr />

Since unlike sony this leak has already been closed. Whereas sony took over a monthy to fix there stuff. <br />
And it took sony not 4 days &gt;.&gt; it took them 7 days to openly admit something happend. <br />
Besides that point sony new they were in deep trouble since nothing was properly encrypted so all the sensitive data was up for grabs without any sort of protection at all. Blizzard in this case has protected it probably with a hash encryption using the SRP protocol. And no names, credit card information etc where lost as it looks now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, first thing when they realized that they were hacked from day 1, whether or not they actually had something compromised, they should have taken the server offline. This is the most basic thing you should do in all cases. Afterwards its scrubbing.</div></div><hr />

yeah sure put my tin foil hat back on right, you DELUSIONAL blizzard FAN-BEEPS!<br />
<br />
Out of the box with SP1 Windows 7 has close to 100 security updates (windows updates). You plug it in with no firewall by default without updating immediately and you'll be hacked. <br />
<br />
Same goes for XP. There's over 250 security fixes since SP3. You will compromised in less than a minute if you plug into the internet without a firewall. There are compromised machines scanning networks non-stop.<br />

Yeah, Blizzard, and any other major companies who have been hacked are obviously full of incompetent fools, since they got hacked. They certainly don't have any training in network security. Blizzard should have had a drool cup.<br />

But since you seem to be the pro when it comes to this, why don't you get a job there and fix their systems so they will never get hacked again? I'm sure they'd pay you well. Oh, you couldn't? That's a shame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your security sucked (somewhere, somehow) and undoubtedly a very large number of email addresses was stolen. But you told us, so thank you Blizz!!<br />
<br />
And yes, that thank you is sarcasm.<br />
<br />
If you don't want that to happen don't use the internet. Cause at some point no matter what service you use there will be a security breach its just a matter of time.<br />
If there is money to be made someone will figure it out.<br />
<br />
So emails were stolen what does that do? they cant get into your account all they can do is spam you maybe you can try not clicking the key logger link?<br />
It was obviously pretty good security if the hacker got into there system yet didn't actually get much (Im sure the hacker thought he had more than he actually did)<br />
<br />
If you look at other recent company's for example Sony or the worse but not as well known Valve breach. You know it took Valve 4 weeks to tell people that there credit card info was &quot;probably&quot; stolen? lol</div></div><hr />

Did you have a authenticator, key loggers can show up as a spybot and not a virus so virus scanners wont see it, wireless security is easily hackable by anyone with linux knowledge, do you use your computers internal firewall, what are the ports.........i can keep going if you want? :P there are many different ways to get into your account an yes sometimes they will add time to your account that has been offline for any amount of time, whats 13 dollars to someone that could potentially use your account to make hundreds if not thousands of dollars.<br />
They dont care what your level is or how long you have been playing (or haven't) its all about the account.<br />
<br />
Macs ar good against potential threats but there not invulnerable http://arstechnica.com/apple/2012/04/mac-trojan-exploits-unpatched-java-vulnerability-no-password-needed/ Took apple 2? weeks to fix that PC's were patched over night.<br />

You should change your email address because it's been farmed and sold. It takes a while to make it around so it wouldn't be from the recent compromise which means another website which allows email addresses to be displayed has been hacked.<br />

Sony didn't disclose it for 18 days, not to mention there were public forums talking about how Sony was running an old version of Apache a few months before the break in was made public. What's worse is Sony had a public facing website that was allowed to access the internal network which is very bad and it most likely was going on for months.<br />
<br />
Blizzard stated it was an internal break in which leans towards an employees laptop becoming infected with malware/rootkit. Most malware makes a lot of noise so any decent IDS system would've let them know quickly that someone's laptop has been compromised.<br />
<br />
I work for Oracle and we are notified within a few hours of a compromise. If I start up a P2P client, I'll get called at my desk in 30 minutes or less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The key fob auth is quite damn hard to hack...seeing its not connected to the internet at all.....and there is a very very small window for them to even try a man in the middle attack...now the auth on mobile phones are more and faster to be hack due to simple fact..most of the new phones that use those apps is connected to the internet.....personally I use the key fob one and think its better then phone app one...seeing cell phones can be broke..stolen...dropped and damaged....so then you can't use it...were as a key fob one you can attack it too your computer and its right there.</div></div><hr />

This is where reading comprehension comes in handy. I never said anything about Blizzard's own systems. I said if you can't secure YOUR OWN computer, you're an idiot.

No. I did not have an authenticator. At the time when I was playing I had the mobile authenticator on my iPhone. However seeing as I do iOS development and I'm constantly installing beta firmwares from Apple I de-authorized my mobile authenticator from my phone when I stopped playing. Spybot is a piece of software for Windows I think you mean Spywear. As for Spywear I only used my Mac to play WoW and to program using XCode. I also used Google Chrome to browse the web, to which at the time no one was able to get out of chrome's sandbox and install something on the local computer. (That didn't happen till March of this year.) All of my ports were and still blocked on my router and also on my computer's firewall. My Battle.net password consisted of a 16 character randomly generated password consisting on different case letters, numbers, and symbols. (This has been bumped to 27 characters.) This password was also only used for Battle.net. The anti-virus I use is ClamXAV, the Mac OS X port of the ever so popular ClamAV which is used on many Unix/Linux based server around the world. It's also worth noting that I've had my WoW account since vanilla (November of 2005) and my account was never once hacked since this incident.<br />
<br />
Also you don't find it strange that my account was 'hacked' without any time being added to the account? (My WoW Characters were cleaned of all their items and the guild bank emptied so they must have been able to login to WoW with no gametime added. [Wish I knew how to do that.]) You don't find it strange that my character was logged into after hours of being banned? (I have a screenshot of this from a friend that noticed and brought it to my attention.) How about my account being so screwed up that no one in my guild could access the guild bank and it took Blizzard a month to fix this issue, even after having 3 different GMs took control of my character and tried it out for themselves? (Literally no one could access the guild bank when you right clicked on it nothing showed up.)</div></div><hr />

Response to SOE being hacked: It's SOEs fault. People leaving SOE in droves.<br />
Reponse to other Battle.net users getting hacked: It's your fault. Not Blizzards. Get an authenticator. Use a unique password. Use a unique email. Don't download addons from untrusted websites. Don't click on links in phishing emails. Always verify the web address before entering your information.<br />
Response to Blizzard being hacked: It's not Blizzards fault. This type of thing is inevitable.<br />

<br />
It's a common misconception that you can only be hacked by something that was on your computer. Some people become compromised because they use the same user name and password on different sites, and then those sites become compromised and your account information is gained without anything ever getting on your computer. They then have access to your email, and then reset the Battle.net password. <br />
<br />
Also, using random letters, numbers and symbols doesn't prevent programs from brute forcing the password. In fact, random letter/number strings are easier for it to break. Using a string of common words is actually much more effective to prevent brute force attempts. See readwriteweb&lt;dot&gt;com/enterprise/2011/01/why-using-2-or-3-simple-words.php<br />
<br />
Most account information isn't obtained through brute force methods though, afaik. They are gained because people use the same information for every other account, and/or infected computers. <br />
<br />

<br />
Not sure how you would know if game time was added or not. Most of the time, game time is added exploitively with fraudulent game time cards, which then are removed once they are determined to be fraudulent. However, in between that time, a player's account is compromised.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
That doesn't sound related to the compromise at all actually. Many guilds have had similar issues unrelated to a compromise. It seems to be more of a guild UI issue. <br />
<br />
All a hacker would do is take the contents of the guild and leave as quickly as possible.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard said it was an internal compromise. That would indicate an external, customer facing website wasn't compromised.
