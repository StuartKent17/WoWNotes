Icecrown Citadel Testing - November 6-7<br />
We are scheduling raid tests in Icecrown Citadel for November 6-7.<br />
<br />
The schedule is as follows:<br />
<br />
US Servers<br />
Friday, November 6 at 7PM EST / 4 PM PST – Valithria Dreamwalker<br />
Saturday, November 7 at 4PM EST / 1PM PST – Icecrown Gunship Battle<br />
<br />
EU Servers<br />
Friday, November 6 at 19:30 CET – Lady Deathwhisper<br />
Saturday, November 7 at 19:30 CET – Professor Putricide<br />
<br />
Only normal difficulties will be tested, although 10 and 25 player raids will be available.<br />
<br />
The Icecrown Citadel raid test schedule will be very flexible, and can change at a moment's notice due to build status, bugs, and server issues. Remember that this is the test server, so things can, do, and will break from time to time. Check this forum for the latest Icecrown Citadel raid testing schedule information in the weeks to come. <br />
<br />
&quot;Frostmourne&quot; Map<br />
A map has been added for the &quot;Frostmourne&quot; subzone of the Icecrown Citadel raid instance ... Nothing to see here, even if the zone was slightly modified since the last time I mentioned it (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/%28spoiler%29-icecrown-citadel-frostmourne-area/) .... <br />

Patch 3.3 - PTR Notes Update 11/05<br />
The official notes have been updated to reflect changes from today's build. Also included an update from 2 days ago that I never had the time to report. <br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Arenas<br />
All abilities that have base cooldowns of 10 minutes or longer cannot be used in Arenas, down from 15 minutes.<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Players no longer need to kill the final bosses in all four wings of this dungeon in order to teleport to Sapphiron. Teleportation orbs have been added to allow players access back and forth from Sapphiron's lair.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
Unholy<br />
Night of the Dead: Now reduces the damage your pet takes from area-of-effect damage by 45/90%, but no longer applies to area-of-effect damage caused by other players. In addition, this talent now reduces the cooldown of Army of the Dead by 2/4 minutes, down from 5/10 minutes. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Tranquility: The cooldown on this spell has been reduced to 8 minutes, down from 10 minutes. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage <br />
Frost<br />
Deep Freeze: This spell now deals a large amount of damage to targets permanently immune to stuns. In addition, when this ability deals damage it will no longer consume two charges of Fingers of Frost for those mages with the Shatter talent. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin<br />
Holy<br />
Sanctified Light: This talent now also has a 33/66/100% chance to prevent Lay on Hands from causing Forbearance when Lay on Hands is used on others.<br />
Retribution<br />
Repentance: This crowd control effect will no longer break early from the damage done by Righteous Vengeance.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest<br />
Divine Hymn: The cooldown on this spell has been reduced to 8 minutes, down from 10 minutes. <br />

<br />
User Interface<br />
Quest Tracking Feature<br />
<br />
Players can now track quest objectives on the map (‘M’ key).&#13;&lt;ul&gt; Quest Log&#13;&lt;ul&gt; A Show Map button has been added to the Quest Log. Selecting a quest and pressing this button will open the map for the zone in which the quest objective is located displaying the associated area of interest. Any other active quests in a player’s Quest Log for that zone will also be displayed.&#13;[/list]&#13; Map&#13;&lt;ul&gt; The map interface has been separated into four separate panes: a map pane (left), a pane listing active quest names for the zone being viewed (right), a pane listing the full quest text for any highlighted quest (bottom left), and a pane listing the quest rewards for any highlighted quest (bottom right).&#13; All active quests listed in the right pane for the zone being viewed on the map will be assigned a number. These numbers will be displayed on the map according to the areas of interest for each quest.&#13; Highlighting a quest name in the right pane will highlight the corresponding area of interest on the map in the left pane, show its quest text in the lower left pane, and list the quest rewards in the lower right pane.&#13; Given that some quest objectives can be achieved in multiple locations within a given zone, highlighting such a quest will highlight an area of interest closest in proximity to the character’s current location.&#13; This feature can be disabled by un-checking the Show Quest Objectives box in the bottom right corner of the new map interface, restoring the map to its standard full-screen display.&#13; Clicking on the arrow in the top right corner of the new map interface will hide all but the map pane, bringing the map out of full-screen mode and allowing players to leave it open while navigating a zone or engaging in combat.&#13;[/list]&#13; Objectives Tracking&#13;&lt;ul&gt; This frame has been improved to offer new functionality and can be used with the new shrunken map option.&#13; The Objectives frame is now docked below the mini-map next to the right 2 action bars and will track up to 12 quests for a zone.&#13; Numbers have been added next to each quest name and objective corresponding with those areas of interest displayed on the map.&#13; If a quest objective has been completed, the number will be replaced with a yellow question mark symbol.&#13; The arrow button in the top right corner of the Objectives frame can be used to toggle between minimizing and maximizing the quest objective display.&#13;[/list]&#13; Quest Difficulty Tracking&#13;&lt;ul&gt; This feature is off by default and can be enabled in the Objectives window from the Interface Options menu. Turning this feature on will color-code all quest names displayed in the map interface according to difficulty (grey, green, yellow, orange, and red).&#13;[/list][/list]&#13;</div></div><hr />

Im pretty sure that you'll still need to clear all of Naxx to get to KT.<br />
<br />
Now, if you need something only from Sapphiron, you dont need to kill every other boss first to attempt to get it</div></div><hr />

Now, if you need something only from Sapphiron, you dont need to kill every other boss first to attempt to get it<br />

<br />
It used to be you actually had to *read* the questlog to complete a quest, and now all you have to do is check the map. I mean, I'll admit, it's cool, but all it's going to do is promote the mindless quest grind, without enjoying the quest text itself. Why not just remove every piece of lore and roleplay from the questgivers, replace quest text with 'GO TO WALL, KILL GHOST, COME BACK' and just send the new players on their way?<br />

It used to be you actually had to *read* the questlog to complete a quest, and now all you have to do is check the map. I mean, I'll admit, it's cool, but all it's going to do is promote the mindless quest grind, without enjoying the quest text itself. Why not just remove every piece of lore and roleplay from the questgivers, replace quest text with 'GO TO WALL, KILL GHOST, COME BACK' and just send the new players on their way?<br />

Reading quest text is a preference. There will be plenty of people of who still read and enjoy the quest text. But for those of us who have played this game for a long time and other MMO's as well who would rather quit the game then read through hours of text... it's a welcome change.</div></div><hr />

I have never used Questhelper but you only have to look on Curse to see how many people download the addon daily to see how many already have and use this functionality. Plus it seems that if you don't want it you can turn it off. Why do you care if Blizzard add it as the norm instead of hundreds of thousands having to keep an addon up-to-date?<br />
<br />
Besides, I refuse to believe anyone ever completed Sweet Amber (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=49) without asking someone else, reading Wowhead or using Questhelper. That thing was in my log for so long (before I discovered Wowhead) by the time I had it completed I was 20 levels too high!</div></div><hr />

Or maybe its their solution so that people don't have to get another add-on like quest-helper just to make it faster leveling a character? Or maybe so people don't have to look up something on wowhead to find out where a mob is? This stuff is already available to people who want to get it, blizzard is just providing something similar.<br />
<br />
Like people said if you want to read the text, you'll still read it. However, after leveling your 3rd character...you just sort of want the quest done, and don't care what it says anymore.</div></div><hr />

But why does it matter? Who cares if they give ease of access to a completely non-relevant boss. You can already get better gear from heroics now.

Most of the them are right on, but at times the quest helper has been off on a few of the quests. There are also lots of quests that are currently broken on the PTR, most likely due to their improvements on quest tracking, but i'm sure those will be hammered out before the final release. It seriously can't get any easier with the changes they've made. It even will give you the quest objective location in area's of the map you haven't even been to yet. <br />
<br />
Once you're out in Outlands and flying with the new improved (swifter) flying mounts at 60, it trivializes all of Outland.<br />
<br />
One thing i have noticed though, with all the greens and blues that would normally have random enchants, they seem to have dropped all the crap ones. No more &quot;of the Eagle&quot; or &quot;Of the fish&quot; etc. Plate will usually be &quot;of the Bear&quot; or Beast or Champion, and cloth will usually be Physician, Sorcerer, and spell power. I think it's all part of streamlining the leveling process, and making it easier for new people to have a better idea on what kind of stats to look for.<br />
<br />
However, there are still mixes of Bandit and Sorcerer mail wear, so we could still see spell stacking Hunters :D</div></div><hr />

It's because of the new 10 minute rule to spells in arena. Basically now you have cooldowns like cold snap sharing the same cooldown with these, same with shaman elementals and say DK army being brought in line with each other. It tends to be better when long cooldowns are not too scattered.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking he's talking about the fact that the armor is mail and has caster stats, but some &quot;Huntards&quot; might just see mail and think &quot;MINE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Perfect example can be found in some PvP off-set pieces, such as Relentless Gladiator's Belt of Salvation (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=41618). A bad rogue might simply see that its usable by rogues and take it for that reason, not caring for stats.<br />

Well if they added 4 models hopefully some are from PVE for once. Never made sense that powerful minions of the Lich King could be rewarded as mounts for duel-in-a-box and not for, y'know, defeating agents of the Lich King.</div></div><hr />

well netherwing drakes were arenas reward in BC everyone else got the rep grind. only difference was gladiators got 310% speed and armored while rep grind didn't. i doubt people would qq about rep grind for frost wyrms. casuals would just get bored and stop grinding after hitting friendly.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be so certain, if you look carefully at the pictures of it you'll notice that it comes in four different colors. I think this pretty much rules out arena (unless it is a different color for each bracket?) but leaves rep grind and the various achievement rewards a possibility. Clockwise starting at the top left the colors are white (plain), brown, blue, and purple. If you think of them as white, tan, cobalt, and violet it starts to sound a lot like the Netherwing Drake colors to me, though I can't remember those off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />

netherdrakes were also known, almost right off the bat, to be a mount almost everyone could get... it wasn't so for frost wyrms... but I still would love the rep grind... the new frost wyrms are the sexiest flying mounts in game, no contest.<br />

I hope to god you guys are right... but I'm still skeptical... besides, who would the rep be with? Cult of the Damned? For all we know, one could be the PvP, 2 could be for LK/Sindragosa HM, and the other could be somethings else entirely, though I have no clue what</div></div><hr />

I would say it's a fair assumption to say the Rep used would be Ashen Verdict. I say this for two reasons: first, it is the only new rep being added, and second, this would and a sort of gate preventing everyone from getting one (seeing as you have to do ICC to get rep with them). A warning though, don't immediately be upset if this is the case because I assume most people will be able to do the 10 man normal version and grind the rep, albeit slower.<br />
<br />
<br />
ya colors are different and even one of them has different armor. so i think we can expect a rep grind unless they have 4 different meta achievements.<br />
<br />
Technically there are four metas: [Normal Mode (10)], [Normal Mode (25)], [Hard Mode (10)], [Hard Mode (25)]. This would allow everyone to get a drake of some sort, while letting hard mode people show off with (bright?) colors. Though I could see this leading to a lot of QQ from people saying it doesn't distinguish the &quot;elite&quot; enough, mostly from people who will never kill Arthas 25 HM.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I think all the possibilities mentioned so far are plausible and would be happy with any. (Yes, even them going to PvP again)</div></div><hr />

I was refering to people who keep claiming you can get better stuff in H-ToC now. I think the new heroic will be in the same boat as ToC...yes there will be high ilevel stuff...but it wont be every slot and it most likely wont feature that many weapons or trinkets.</div></div><hr />

That portal looks the same as the heroic mode toc ones so its not that big a deal...<br />

Most of the them are right on, but at times the quest helper has been off on a few of the quests. There are also lots of quests that are currently broken on the PTR, most likely due to their improvements on quest tracking, but i'm sure those will be hammered out before the final release. It seriously can't get any easier with the changes they've made. It even will give you the quest objective location in area's of the map you haven't even been to yet. <br />
<br />
Once you're out in Outlands and flying with the new improved (swifter) flying mounts at 60, it trivializes all of Outland.<br />
<br />
One thing i have noticed though, with all the greens and blues that would normally have random enchants, they seem to have dropped all the crap ones. No more &quot;of the Eagle&quot; or &quot;Of the fish&quot; etc. Plate will usually be &quot;of the Bear&quot; or Beast or Champion, and cloth will usually be Physician, Sorcerer, and spell power. I think it's all part of streamlining the leveling process, and making it easier for new people to have a better idea on what kind of stats to look for.<br />

<br />
It used to be you actually had to *read* the questlog to complete a quest, and now all you have to do is check the map. I mean, I'll admit, it's cool, but all it's going to do is promote the mindless quest grind, without enjoying the quest text itself. Why not just remove every piece of lore and roleplay from the questgivers, replace quest text with 'GO TO WALL, KILL GHOST, COME BACK' and just send the new players on their way?<br />
<br />
I dunno. It all feels a bit silver-spoon-in-the-mouth to me. Buffed XP gain from questing, new quest maps, new quest tracking... I get that Blizzard want people to quest more, but to the point where the point of questing (ie to LEARN about the world you're living in WHILE gaining XP) is all but gone?<br />
<br />
Hope it doesn't turn out the way it's beginning to feel. I have faith, although it's waining slightly.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree 100% with this guy. And just to add, they made most 1-60 group quest easily soloable. Blizz, seriously? What the fuck are guys you thinking?

You mean things they've been working on since Warhammer released? They've been working on the Quest Tracker for over a year, long before Aion's features were widely known in the US or western markets. As for the tutorials, Aion is hardly the first to do them the way they do.<br />
<br />
In regards to the frostwyrms, due to the trend of &quot;only the elitist pricks deserve cool toys&quot; mentality that Blizz seems to have to gotten in bed with, I don't see frostwyrms being available in the same way as netherdrakes are. This is disappointing since frostwyrms are rather iconic for this expansion, much more than netherdrakes were for BC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jesus, could questing possibly be made anymore easy?<br />
<br />
It used to be you actually had to *read* the questlog to complete a quest, and now all you have to do is check the map. I mean, I'll admit, it's cool, but all it's going to do is promote the mindless quest grind, without enjoying the quest text itself. Why not just remove every piece of lore and roleplay from the questgivers, replace quest text with 'GO TO WALL, KILL GHOST, COME BACK' and just send the new players on their way?<br />
<br />
I dunno. It all feels a bit silver-spoon-in-the-mouth to me. Buffed XP gain from questing, new quest maps, new quest tracking... I get that Blizzard want people to quest more, but to the point where the point of questing (ie to LEARN about the world you're living in WHILE gaining XP) is all but gone?<br />
<br />
Hope it doesn't turn out the way it's beginning to feel. I have faith, although it's waining slightly.<br />
<br />
<br />
There isn't that much lore in the quest text to begin with. I read them too. Once anyway. So I know a lot of it is merely describing what you need to do and flavor chatter and little &quot;learn about the world.&quot; There are a few lore loaded quests, but the vast majority of them ARE 'GO TO WALL, KILL GHOST, COME BACK' except that they type it out much neater and bloat it up a little. <br />
<br />
And also you can gloss over the summary section of the quest text to figure out what to do. <br />
<br />
And besides I think this is for the people who skip quest text anyway.</div></div><hr />

Late response, i know, but yeah.<br />

So far the random enchants on greens (even old world) have been actually useful stuff. It could be i'm just getting extremely lucky on the drops, but all in all, the random stat greens and blues have had the right stats. (Or at least stats that would actually be desirable for that armor type.)</div></div><hr />

I don't happen to agree with you.<br />
<br />
The new quest tracking features are not on by default. To get the full Quest Tracker like interface you need to turn on about 5 different boxes. They didn't take the quest text out completely - you can still read it in the quest log.<br />
<br />
A person who likes reading the quest text to figure out where to go isn't going to all of a sudden stop doing so. Likewise you have people who don't read the quest text already anyway so a feature like this is just something they've already had in an addon anyway. They're going to continue doing so - this feature isn't going to stop them.<br />
<br />
This way Blizzard has to provide support for some sort of quest tracking feature and can't take the &quot;we don't officially support add ons&quot; cop out.</div></div><hr />

I've been testing the new quest objective tracking and tutorials on a Level 3 shammy on the PTR (yep level 3 already :))<br />
<br />
As per usual for when Blizzard implements ideas from addons what they have done here is just your basic funtionality. IE where do I go on the map and where do I turn it in.<br />
<br />
It won't tell you how to do the more complex quests that require you to get x of some objective then combine it with some other object for example. Or the ones that require to use this thing here then this thing over here then go here. That is from what I can see on my Level 3 guy ...I will need some ideas of the more complex quests I can do on my Level 80 warlock to confirm this.<br />
<br />
It won't tell you the best route to do the quests in. Nor will it tell you the best order to do those quests in. It won't give you locations of herbs and veins on the map. It won't tell you what you've got on your other toons. There's a whole raft load of features that addons like QuestHelper and Carbonite provide that this new quest tracking feature will not do.<br />
<br />
There's still opportunities in the addon community for addons like QuestHelper and Carbonite to still exist. They just need to rewritten to take advantage of the new quest tracking features (Zorba's already onto it)</div></div><hr />

&quot;Buy your new frost wyrm mount! In Blizz store!&quot;<br />
<br />
On a side note... &quot;We received Q... err, comments that Paladins are still playing defensively, so now Flash of Light and Holy Light aren't castable on self anymore - new talent change, Art of War - Allows you to cast Flash of Light on yourself with normal cast time&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;patch 4.0 stop playing defensively damn! FoL, HoL, HoP, DS, DP, HoF and everything you can cast will apply our new forbearance that put all your spells/skills in 2min CD. New talent change, Art of War - Allows you to cast something without loosing all your gear for 5 minutes.&quot;<br />

Because Aion was the first right? Warhammer had quest tracking, so did LOTR online iirc. And probably a few other online games as well.<br />
Go back to Aion if you think that WoW is taking stuff from them, since obviously you like it so much.<br />

Sigh. An in-built quest tracking feature has been asked for for a while, and it was in development pre-Aion-release. It just had a whole lot of problems, made all the more evident in 3.2, when they tried implementing it, but had to take it out simply because it didn't work.<br />

No. Aion isn't special. At least, no more so than any other grindy MMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seeing how there are 4 colors from the new Armored Frostwyrm I'm hoping it will be a Faction mount much like Netherwing but from the Icecrown Citadel faction. Just because Gladiators got Armored Frostwyrms doesn't mean Blizzard won't give some to other players its same as the Proto Drakes you can get some from Raiding while other Proto Drakes are available as drops or 5man Heroic Achievements.<br />
<br />
Also for those who didn't make the connection the CD's that got reduced to 8 min are because Blizzard want those to be useable in Arena since they lowered the max CD time to 10 min.<br />
<br />
And about Sapphiron I believe its like some have said, you can't kill Kel'thuzad just because Sapphiron dies so you will have to kill all final bosses in the wings also. Making so you can kill Sapphiron without clearing the full instance is just so you can get the Focusing Iris Key in my opinion since I think several people want to kill Malygos without having to do a full Naxxramas clear for a key that only one person gets.</div></div><hr />

QUEST INFORMATION <br />

an answer to you and everyone else that made the same comment.if you guys start reading about mmos and stop just playing the newest while playing wow,then you will see that many adds that wow has now existed long before the game you might have said,its like achievements and the WAR fans were saying that blizzard copied from them(hell even a producer said that)while at the same time the entire talent tree system of LOTRO is based on achievements(they call them deeds)<br />
as for in game quest...AOC,LOTRO,WAR are the games that i can think at this moment that had one</div></div><hr />

For sure....like how voice chat made Ventrilo completely obsolete! Oh...that's right. Blizzard's implementation sucked.<br />

Yeah laughed at this too. <br />
<br />
The spell is highly retarded in it's nature anyway, one of few times I would consider a use for it is when the raid is taking serious damage and I need to keep vital target up while having other raid healers backing me up on the rest, but at that point 90% of the time I take damage too and considering it's a channeled spell, this makes it pretty much the least used spell by me, this and ofc the long cool down. When you get it through however, it's actually pretty good, but not really needed, the buff is nice tho so it's usually just casted for that by me. <br />
<br />

Situational, Channeled, Long CD = forget about it and use something different.</div></div><hr />

Gladiaor mounts are already announced. Sorry, this one is is for PvE, they just reversed what they did in Wotlk (armored drakes arena, nether ones for...pve, sorta). Two color variations, for the meta.

There is a possibility that a Frost Wyrm mount will likely drop off of Sindragosa, but to say that armored mounts with the exact same colours the PvP drakes is just being foolish and greedy. It's fairly obvious they are going to be updating the PvP drakes models.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It used to be you actually had to *read* the questlog to complete a quest, and now all you have to do is check the map. I mean, I'll admit, it's cool, but all it's going to do is promote the mindless quest grind, without enjoying the quest text itself. Why not just remove every piece of lore and roleplay from the questgivers, replace quest text with 'GO TO WALL, KILL GHOST, COME BACK' and just send the new players on their way?<br />
<br />
I dunno. It all feels a bit silver-spoon-in-the-mouth to me. Buffed XP gain from questing, new quest maps, new quest tracking... I get that Blizzard want people to quest more, but to the point where the point of questing (ie to LEARN about the world you're living in WHILE gaining XP) is all but gone?<br />
<br />
Hope it doesn't turn out the way it's beginning to feel. I have faith, although it's waining slightly.<br />
<br />
<br />
People were using Questhelper and carbonite way before this so it makes no difference anyway. I'm sure it will have an off button if you don't like it. QQ for QQ sake?</div></div><hr />

Well, they could make it so it affects all but humanoids, but it'd still be a pretty big nerf for those random humanoid bosses.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, it's probably to deal with PVP. Personal opinions about it aside, that proc would be pretty nasty in a BG.<br />
<br />
They could decrease the AOE when used in a PVP setting, maybe, but even then, it would be yet another factor...<br />
<br />
At the very least, they should add Dragonkin so they can still level with it [considering we'd probably have to deal with a lot more dragons next expansion.]</div></div><hr />

So, with that logic in hand, Shaman are more likely to be female harpies than Vrykul given the name exists right now. <br />

However, they're more apt to be some variant of Lich, http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/october/deathwhisper.jpg</div></div><hr />

Just curious but are you sure about the meta thing?<br />
<br />
Ashen Verdict almost certainly has a cosmetic reward tied to it given that literally every other faction in WotLK has.<br />
<br />
(Green Protodrake - Oracles, Frenzyheart Brew - Frenzyheart, Red Drake - Wyrmwrest, Kirin Tor - Discounts on half a dozen cosmetic items, Argent Crusade - Tourney rewards and warhorse/charger, Ebon Blade - DK only gruphon, Silver Covenant/Sunreavers - Hawkstrider/Quel'dorei Steed, Ally Vanguard, Horde Exp. - Motorcycle, Sons of Hodir - 2 mammoths, Iron Boot Flash - WSO/EXL...)<br />
<br />
The Ashen Verdict almost certain has a cosmetic rewards somewhere in there, whether as a drop from dailies, a currency turn-in or a simple faction reward.</div></div><hr />

TBH, Arena players shouldn't have gotten a frostwyrm mount anyways.. it makes zero sense and isn't tied to pvp whatsoever. They are major lore figures for ICC and if they weren't a drop or rep farm from there, it would just be plain silly.</div></div><hr />

Addon authors will need to extract that data and present it in an addon somehow. <br />
<br />
Everyquest already does this. <br />
<br />
The latest version of Everyquest will let you export quest data for a toon on the PTR. You can then transfer over it's savedvariables file over to live and get the same version of the addon to import from that data you exported on the PTR. <br />

Quests you've done are highlighted in green , ones you have not in white. Although I wish the author would add a search :)</div></div><hr />

Onyxia's Lair (Level 60) - You can no longer get this achievement by looting Tier 2 Helms. <br />

I find it rather hilarious that they changed the drop location of the T2 helms without realizing it would affect this achievement. Yet you can still get the achievement without ever killing Onyxia at all, if you are a hunter, simply by completing the quest A Proper String. The item for said quest (Mature Black Dragon Sinew) has a chance to drop from any level 55+ black dragonkin. Of course, you have to kill Majordomo and loot the leaf, but if you can kill Nefarian to get the Ony FoS, then killing Domo should be cake.</div></div><hr />
