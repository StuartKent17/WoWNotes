Last time this was the case so I imagine it's the same.<br />
<br />
To clarify I had six months shortly before bfa launched and I got the boat. When it released.</div></div><hr />

they seen how badly patch was taken and they pop another 6 months sub <br />
<br />
hillariusly desperate. <br />
<br />
but i doubt it will work this time - people are way to pissed about how garbage nazjatar is and have such PTSD after Bfa launch then it simply wont work.</div></div><hr />

The offers said recurring subscribers with a 6 months one should get it no later than 8 july.</div></div><hr />

1 month later:</div></div><hr />

This way I get free mount and even save 13€ from buying subscription (6month is cheaper). I know I will play this game, though mostly classic when it release. <br />
Of course if there are people who will buy 6month sub just to get a mount and doesn't even play the game, they are retards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, copied from store page<br />
<br />
<br />
For a limited time, when you sign up for a 6-month subscription to World of Warcraft, you’ll also receive the Sylverian Dreamer, an enchanting addition to any mount collection. If you’re currently on a 6-month recurring subscription with a future renewal date, you will receive the Sylverian Dreamer mount at no additional charge, no later than July 8, 2019.</div></div><hr />

most likely delibarate move in hope people will forget to cancel subscription instead just letting game time run out. <br />

If you pay for your sub with actual real-world currency and not in-game gold / wow tokens, it's not an awful offer to get something extra for the 6 month sub.<br />
<br />
Six months game time is $12.99 USD a month x 6 months = $77.94. Mount is effectively free at that renewal rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If people were only going to play classic they wouldn't care about a new mount that is only in the retail version of the game. Also if people want just the mount and no other nonsense they can buy it unlike the boat which at first you had to buy bulk time or sub for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is it depserate? Buy it for $25 dollars or buy it for $78. That isn't desperation. It is just offering bundles to reward people. If you aren't going to play for 6-months then buy the mount on its own. If you are going to stay subscribed for 6-months then buy/keep the subscription and get the mount for free.<br />
<br />
These desperate and stupid attempts to hate everything need to stop. It is just a marketing promotion to increase the value of a subscription. You either get it for free or you pay $25 dollars for it. Pass it by if you want.</div></div><hr />

Boat was with game time, NOT subscription. It's two different services. Check it yourself before correcting someone, you can NOT get this promo with bnet balance.<br />

<br />
Yeah, definitely.<br />
<br />
I mean I have been defending them usually, even with boat, but this time they've managed to disappoint even me. Boat with game time was a good deal, but switching that to subscription instead of game time is a clear sign of desperation, and dick move to people who have been paying their subs through token since their introduction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is very, VERY worrisome at the current point in time, considering that 8.2 JUST landed.</div></div><hr />

You posted basically the same thing twice. Why do you feel that level of hate and rage to essentially spam the forums? They don't even release subscription numbers to the public anymore and focus more on MAU anyways. They are also offering it during the 40% off sale for BfA and a major content patch. It is standard marketing tactics to get people to play the game.<br />

<br />
i hope this is a rhetorical joke type question, of course sub numbers are bad, they are the lowest point the game has seen since it launched 15 years ago, based on player census data the best guess we can make is that there's about 2 million subs worldwide with around half of them being in china, the rest spread between US/EU/asia with the bulk of the remainder being EU, so you do the math, add to the fact that the faction imbalance is ludicrous now and there's no sign of that changing any time soon, so all in all this is a cash grab of the highest order to try and drum up as much money as possible before they report their financials, the last two months wow has not been seen on any of the top charts for income so i guess they feel desperate enough to pull this shit.</div></div><hr />

they stopped reporting sub numbers because it was showing just how bad of a state the game was in and showing that they were haemorrhaging subscribers with no sign of them stopping, and we are at the lowest sub count since the game began based on player census data so you tell me why people shouldn't be pissed off at an obvious cash grab when they have neglected players for so long now?</div></div><hr />

this is so desperate move<br />

hillariusly desperate. <br />

but i doubt it will work this time - people are way to pissed about how garbage nazjatar is and have such PTSD after Bfa launch then it simply wont work.<br />
<br />
You don't seem to grasp how things work. I bet you're one of those people who screamed about the boat too.<br />
<br />
In order for them to offer this mount now, it would have had to have been completed and ready to release MONTHS ago. The quality of patch 8.2 literally had NOTHING to do with the mount.<br />
<br />
This was going to release whether the patch was a roaring success or a bombing fail because people come back for the patches and the dragon is a prize for staying. It's the exact same thing with the boat. It's not a desperation thing. It's a &quot;Oh, hey, welcome back to the game. Stay a while and listen.&quot; for those who choose to come back, and a free passive reward for those who never left.</div></div><hr />

I normally would. But I'm angry at this. I'm angry at them for the first time (well, their business practices at least, since as far as their in-game decisions go, I'm angry at them a lot more often), I'm usually in the &quot;company trying to earn money, more news at 11&quot; camp. <br />

I'm not angry about the mount itself, that's just company trying to earn money, and there's nothing wrong with it. But moving the promotion from game time to subscription is fucking annoying.</div></div><hr />

Well this game went downhill (for me anyways, just a personal opinion) from the moment wrath of the lich king ended. If people endured cata, pandamon and so forth I doubt they think its so bad right now. From what I read this xpac isnt better or worse than the previous ones.</div></div><hr />

Maybe we will see more of this model come Blizzcon in a few months? If I recall, Blizzard did something similar with a store mount later in MoP, the Iron Skyreaver. It had a new, exclusive, hi-res model over an existing frame, but eventually we saw a lot more of that model with WoD. Presumably, this bird/dragon mash up will be a common sight once 9.0 info starts dropping.</div></div><hr />

That being said, 4 more days until the end of the fiscal quarter. So this does scream that they need a boost in revenue by getting 6 months of sub fees all at once.

Why would anyone resubscribe for a $25 dollar mount? And if they were why would they pay $78 just because of a $25 mount.

I would agree with you, but this bell has already been rung, there is no going back. The mount shop will not close and it will constantly get new additions to it. If this mount did not exist, the &quot;problem&quot; would still exist.<br />

Although I fail to see how a cosmetic incentive to make you sub is a problem. But I can respect your opinion on that matter.</div></div><hr />

Prior to to the WOW token I would regularly do 6 month subs.<br />

If your regularly come and go with wow seasons, then no, it’s not worth it. But if you know you’ll be around for the next 6 months then it’s a free mount.<br />

'Oh no he brought a free tee shirt because he had a discount card. so unfair, how dare he own that discount card (6 month reoccurring sub), to buy that free tee-shirt (mount). I am going to complain to the store<br />

You're delusional if think they don't have a few mounts they're working on ready to launch in a few days time for things like this. Sometimes they have mounts created and put into the game 6+ months ahead of time that they finally reveal as a store mount or for something like this.<br />

It does not matter what effect this is using. There is storyboarding, scripting, approval rounds, video capturing, video editing, promo material to create. If done through the proper channels, there is absolutely no way to create such a thing in 2 days. <br />
<br />
I work in the ad industry and I see videos like these on a daily basis. Of course I do not know their workflow, but even if they have the most efficient workplace ever, to say that they did this in response to 8.2 is pretty insane. They might not even have 8.2 proper numbers yet.<br />

The Quality of in-game rewards has not been impacted since they started doing subscription bundles. It didn't happen with tyreal's charger, Dreadwake, or this one. We just got a patch with several cool and/or unique in-game only rewards. Before flinging insults you might want to make sure your own position is not dumb.

My six months expires in September. Blizzard just gave me the mount. You get it for free by paying for a new 6-month subscription or already having paid a 6-month subscription. Even if you want to make the silly argument that nothing is ever free the mount is given at no additional charge. You are getting a $25 value for spending $78 on a subscription.</div></div><hr />

It is a combination of marketing. Offer discounts on BfA. Offer incentives to subscribe for 6-months. Offer new content to encourage purchasing of your two other deals going on. It has nothing to do with the quality of a patch or anything else. It is standard business and Blizzard has offered deal and discounts around major releases before. A $25 mount will not sway anyone to stay away from Final Fantasy.<br />
<br />
Take the Tin Foil hat off.</div></div><hr />

They basically put a new mount in the shop like they've done a million times. BUT, they also give it away for free for those who already pay 6-monthly, or those who'd like to do it at this time.<br />
<br />
It's the same fucking things except some of us get it for free. Millennials will never cease to amaze me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The promotion lasts for a month. It doesn't make sense to offer a deal when people might be coming back for a major patch? Also when they already have the game discounted by 40%? If people don't know how businesses, sales, and other stuff works they really shouldn't be speculating or commenting about it.</div></div><hr />

You can play more then one product. You are still making the claim that an entire expansion for a competitors game is only worth a $25 mount. If they were not going to play WoW why would they suddenly pick it over another game for a $25 mount? Of course they will probably play WoW if they buy a subscription but that isn't the argument you are making.<br />
<br />
You are literally saying that FF is so terrible that a $25 mount can convince people not to play it and to play WoW instead. As usual though the haters create any argument they can think of no matter how dumb in order to justify their hate. You've hopped from reason to reason each time someone clearly refutes your previous one.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what your point is...because I never said everybody plays with 6 month sub.<br />
Just stating a fact that people who buy 6 month sub are the ones wanting to play the game and most likely enjoy it because otherwise I doubt they would want to play... no one is going to play and pay for a game they don't enjoy due to a mount.<br />

I'll enjoy it. I actually just saved money rather than spent $75 by subbing for 6 months that I would have been subbed for anyway. I wouldn't have bothered changing from monthly without the deal. Now I'll have more money and a mount. Not sure why I'd be upset about that.</div></div><hr />

In all those years I don't think I've had any long breaks - At least none at a month or more. Maybe a week here and there, but that's it.<br />
So let's say I played since June 2008 - So 11 years in total.<br />
11 years * 12 months = 132 months<br />
<br />
132 months * 12€ per month = 1584€ spent on game time when paying every 3 months<br />
132 months * 11€ per month = 1452€ spent on game time when paying every 6 months<br />
So basically, if I had changed to 6 months from the beginning, I could have saved 132€.<br />
<br />
So people can call this desperate all they want, but I just changed to a 6 month subscription - But I'm probably not gonna use the mount ever lol.</div></div><hr />

And they have until July 28th to purchase a 6-month subscription and get the mount. Nothing is stopping them from using the promotion. You are the one that made the claim it was to counter Final Fantasy. A $25 mount is what the use to draw people away from their biggest competitor?

<br />
It is $25 for the mount. $78 for a subscription to a game I enjoy. Some days more and some days less. But the value I get is still justified by the cost I spend. Why are you so against people enjoying what they want? And you keep bringing up $75. You can't even get the correct cost of a 6-month subscription right. Toxicity at its finest. Whine about something then bail when someone confronts you all while rehashing the same low effort attacks.<br />
<br />
6x13=78. In order for your $75 to be correct the subscription would have to be $12.50 a month. You are wrong on all accounts. So keep hating and/or go back to your main account.</div></div><hr />

These desperate and stupid attempts to hate everything need to stop. It is just a marketing promotion to increase the value of a subscription. You either get it for free or you pay $25 dollars for it. Pass it by if you want.<br />

Its actually not p2w at all unless this mount does something nobody realizes yet.</div></div><hr />

Stupid bastard...<br />

Oh what a surprise, he DID make a video about it. Throwing the words &quot;Desperate&quot; and &quot;Cynical&quot; around as usual. <br />
Though those terms more fittingly summarize his retarded fucking channel making bank by talking shit about Blizzard and his other inane First World Problems. I am disappointed about the lack of comparisons to some horrific human tragedy this time. He's still a stupid bastard though.</div></div><hr />

And/or. There are a lot of people on mmo-champion that use alt accounts to troll, hate, or after getting banned. Or any number of other reasons. You have a low post count, less then a month old, and have a generally toxic attitude towards WoW given your post history. It wasn't using it as any excuse. But pretty convenient for you to find another reason to dismiss what I am saying huh?</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be that harsh. I can't believe even he believes the stuff he's saying. A year or two ago, he actually had some reasonable and intelligent videos. Then he found a market he can play to. He's just playing to his regular viewers. He found his niche and getting regular clicks for it.</div></div><hr />

It depends on how decide to look at it<br />
<br />
The bad way<br />
<br />
Hey guys, you probably know we are literally bleeding subs right now. And we want to do anything to get some back! So pleeeease buy our super expensive store mount and sub times, yeah? Thanks!<br />
<br />
The good way<br />
<br />
Hey guys, you probably know we just released a new major patch! We hope you like it. If you do, how about subbing for 6 months? You not only save money in the long run, but you also get a free mount! Eh, how about that. That's quite a deal!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They're probably not bleeding subs at all right now, they just launched a big patch.<br />
<br />
But I think they realize that outside of them just gating stuff by a week (Like the continuation of the Nazjatar story), there's not much that people will stay around for until two weeks from now when the raid/dungeon comes out. That combined with a competitor dropping an expansion release makes it pretty obvious they're doing this to lock in their 75 bucks from people.</div></div><hr />

There is a difference between dislike and toxic. Your posts about this mount and ridiculous arguments as to why it is bad put you in the toxic camp. You are finding any reason you can to trash them over a $25 savings promotion.</div></div><hr />

A single thread has put me in the toxic camp? Got it. I definitely don't have like 15 quotes from 3 of you in this thread. It's me that's the one that's too invested! xD<br />
<br />
Maybe you should look at yourself and your rabid defense before accusing anybody else of any kind of bias.</div></div><hr />

Definitely true.<br />
<br />
One of those, however, is more likely than the other one when it comes to gaming corporations in today's world.</div></div><hr />

This mount is actually less unique then some of the ones we got in the patch as it’s just a remodelled drake where the Mecha wheel and crab are comply new.<br />
<br />
Yeah I meant that. Mecha things come with setting. This dragon thing is outside current fantasy scope. Also it's aquisition is much easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
$78. Why do you keep ignoring the actual price? Again why would someone pay $78 to get a free $25 mount if they were not interested in playing wow and instead wanted to play Final Fantasy? A $25 mount locks people in against a competitors entire expansion worth of content? Its funny how now you are dropping the &quot;its not free argument&quot; as well.<br />
<br />
This has nothing to with Final Fantasy. While the timing of 8.2 might loosely be tied to it the promotion has everything to do with capitalizing on returning players. Just like the 40% BfA is.</div></div><hr />

Paying for cosmetic is a benefit, whether you like it or not.<br />
<br />
People pay tons of cash just to be different.</div></div><hr />

Claiming people are too invested because they disagree with you is toxic. Saying people are rabidly defending something because they disagree with you is toxic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Acquisition doesn’t effect rather it’s unique though. The dragon is also not out of the fantasy scope we already have a ton of other weird dragons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paying to be different is not paying to win. This mount doesn't allow you to win at anything. No advantage is gained.</div></div><hr />
