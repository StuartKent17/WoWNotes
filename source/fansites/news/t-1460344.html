In expansions, we inevitably make a lot of changes. In the past, we haven't done as good of a job as we could at explaining /why/ on each. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429697502300741632))<br />
This time around, we're going to try to improve that, significantly. Things like design philosophy, intended effects, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429698064182284288))<br />
It's a much larger undertaking than it may sound. The translation logistics alone are huge. But we're hoping you like the result (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429698372832727040))<br />

All this sounds like its a much better Dancing Rune Weapon<br />
We've made some significant improvements to DRW's functionality in 6.0, so hopefully this won't feel 'much better' anymore. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430929903580495872))<br />

hearing reports that starfall doesn't proc meta gem (maybe trinkets too) since the hotfix for nazgrim/immerseus<br />
That is probably correct. We'll look into it. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/429300259991191552))<br />
thank you, I'd be fine not using starfall in D-stance anyway if you have to revert hotfix.<br />
Starfall not procing things should have no basically impact on DPS. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429332093458329600))<br />
Starfall helped increase APM. A lot of players are changing playstyle/rotation to increase APM to &quot;force&quot; ICD procs<br />
I'd like to see whatever basis you have for doing that. Its impact on trinket uptime is extremely negligible. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429338941452333061))<br />
additionally, if bindings doesn't proc on the icd, it has a large impact on dmg on 1st trans adds on garrosh (embodied doubt)<br />
Starfall can still proc Bindings of Immerseus; just tried it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429344033983307776))<br />
well this is awkward<br />
And Starfall couldn't proc Lightweave before either. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429344696737882112))<br />

with the buff of aspect of the hawk. will iron hawk get the +10% ap ontop it used to have or just be +10% damage reduction?<br />
Perhaps a misunderstanding? Iron Hawk and regular Hawk have the same +%AP. The recent buff affected both. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430594132558348288))<br />
iron hawk used to be +35% ap when hawk was+25%. so iron hawk had a extra 10%ap as well as 10% damage reduction.<br />
That has never been true, at any point. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430599249454059521))<br />

E.g. right now lots of players avoiding Shadow priest because of low &quot;theoretical&quot; parsing, but doing well when able to multidot<br />
Yeah, people play and put effort into what they hear is best. Inflates those numbers, deflates what's perceived as worse. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/428804554814009344))<br />
Do players also tend toward easier specs that do well, like Frost Mage (very easy) vs say Fire (more random, less control), etc?<br />
That helps a bit, yeah. Destruction is much easier to get near optimal damage out of than Demonology. Contributes to the percep. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/428806133587783680))<br />

What's the ability that's given the design crew the most nightmares recently?<br />
Shadow Reflection, at the moment. Customizing what it copies, and ensure it benefits from other passives. We'll get it right. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430918543828209666))<br />
It has pretty crazy potential. I'm especially eager to see what some high end PvPers can do with it, when they get good at... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430919606090231808))<br />
...anticipating their enemies actions. It will be very hard to line up, but you could both damage and CC/interrupt with it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430919861384933376))<br />
(Of course it has quite solid PvE potential as well, but the things you do with it will be less... unexpected) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430920930814984192))<br />
Maybe not best place/time for this q, but: What happens if current target despawns/dies or a target clear otherwise occurs?<br />
Shadow despawns. She's tied to the target. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430923607955345408))<br />
So it requires 16 seconds of consecutive uptime on a single target to work fully -- and 9 just to have any effect at all?<br />
Er... wait. Maybe not uptime. What happens if I hit ShadRef while out of range of the target and spam Mutilate for 8 seconds?<br />
Target needs to be attackable at time 0, and time 8-16. You need to be able to attack SOMETHING for time 0-8. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430925076007886849))<br />
It only copies abilities you successfully cast. You don't have to be in range of what you put it on though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430925191208644608))<br />
So basically Shadow is much cooler, simpler and easy to use version of Focusing Crytal?<br />
Nope. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430931779667496960))<br />
does the shadow only copy abilities or autoattacks as well? Poisons?<br />
Offensive abilities only, no auto attacks or poisons. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430928516364783616))<br />
Is the shadow affected by any diminishing return timers that the player may have triggered during the &quot;recording&quot; period?<br />
Yes, DR fully affects all of her casts, just as if you or another friendly rogue had cast them. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430926783743918080))<br />
I take it that means dynamic buffs also update on the rogue/shadow dynamically (e.g., Heroism at the 10th second)?<br />
She inherits your buffs live, not offset. So you get an Agi proc and Mut just before it wears off, it won't affect her Mut. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430928197274701824))<br />
However, if you get an Agi proc AFTER you Mutilate, her Mutilate WOULD benefit from it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430928306578272257))<br />
Suessing it wont work for Smoke? Or will the debuff be refreshed on the target and still removed elsewhere?<br />
I know Smoke Bomb has offensive potential, but we're not going to count it as an offensive ability; she won't copy it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430928815250874368))<br />
It's going to be a lot of fun watching how our resident geniuses plan and plot around all of this. I really hope it works.<br />
Yeah, it has a really fun kit to it too; it's like you're teaching a pupil the best combo you know. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430929306097688577))<br />
An incredibly adept pupil, anyway. And attractive, too.<br />
Hah... Not at the moment! My test character is currently one of the new race models that isn't done yet... Untextured skin! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430930242937430016))<br />
I can only imagine what that looks like, I'm guessing a little creepy.<br />
More than a little. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430930848376827904))<br />
<br />
Example: the rogue might start with a 4 combo finisher, is that the first thing she will cast as well?<br />
Yes, her finishers are copies of yours, as far as CP goes. The first thing she'd cast would be a 4cp finisher in your example. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430991533303558144))<br />
It would already be op and stupid in pvp if it only copied damage (double Killing S or double SD + MfD) ...<br />
Fortunately, I can tell by your tweets that you're misunderstanding the basics of the ability. The offset is gigantic. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/431005696553791489))<br />

Why was Far Sight stealth nerfed for Shamans? Got no major complaints about it, but for a flavor spell, it no longer has flavor.<br />
I'm not aware of any nerf to it; what changed? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/431366148282523648))<br />
It has gone from unlimited range to 1000 yard range, so basically it's just a &quot;zoom&quot; now. It's a huge change for the worse sadly<br />
Probably just a bugfix for some bug. Your client doesn't even load that far away anyway. How has it affected you? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/431369188288913408))<br />
Actually, you could use Far Sight within Far Sight - we could see from Moonglade to Tanaris if we wanted to.<br />
Ahhhh, that's right! I forgot about that. I'll see if I can find out why the range was added, and if there's some alternate fix. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/431370500783099904))<br />
Excellent! Alot of shammies have been wondering about this, it has always been a truly fun flavor spell, bit sad over the change<br />
Good news: Found an alternate fix, and put it back to unlimited range. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/431487304423591936))<br />

just read your tweets about demo lock. They are underpowered, they are far behind in single target and aoe, a fix would be good.<br />

is it possible to add in WoD a proc art for raging blow in fury spec? Dont get why we dont already have one <br />

Does &quot;it nerfs PvE prot warrs hard on the altar of PvP&quot; hold water ?<br />
Feel like PvE players can get similar gameplay if they had talented into the stun through Warbringer. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430435763616894976))<br />
But lose double charge in the process. I'm also thinking about the hinted stormbolt/bladestorm swap.<br />
Warriors can currently build into too much control or too much damage. The swap would fix that. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430436746069696512))<br />
The only compelling argument is that the spell has been a certain way forever &amp; this change needs more testing. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430434263419211776))<br />
The argument that &quot;we tried this before&quot; doesn't hold water as it's a different change. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430434363528847360))<br />
No, same change. Charge on DR did not work.<br />
We were keeping charge on a different DR, but removing the part that stops casting. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430436488468131840))<br />
So the whole point of this change is to get rid of focus charge interrupts.<br />
Charge's design is a gap closer. They have gained control/disruption through the talent tree. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430437823833862144))<br />
We have no problem with warrior mobility but Double Time/Juggernaut have made them too disruptive (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430438005434617856))<br />
So sort of confused as what the final iteration of changes will be. Charge left alone, DS/Pummel sharing a CD?<br />
Yes, charge left alone, DS/Pummel sharing a CD. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430441516918530048))<br />
And I don't agree that you need it to be a stun to be effective at peeling or stopping a cast. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430434793684099072))<br />
We like this direction, but it's probably too much for 5.4.7. We plan on reverting the change. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430434903163805696))<br />

Would it be possible to allow fury warriors to wield a 2 hander and a one hander at the same time??<br />
It's already possible, but we don't tune it to be viable (or plan to). Not as cool theme to it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430400149815189504))<br />
Why can't arms wield 2x 1handers for shows?<br />

Patch 5.4.7 - Alterac Valley Map Changes<br />
@AlteracValley shared (https://twitter.com/AlteracValley/status/431202084730331136) some images of some tweaks made to the Horde base in Patch 5.4.7. The hill that allows you to jump the fence into the base and the gap between the fence and tower entering the back of the baseare now gone, adding chokepoints for the Horde to take advantage of. <br />
<br />
We can take a look next month and see if these map tweaks help (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3707-Battleground-Win-Ratios-Upcoming-SoO-Changes-Feedback-Blue-Tweets-DLC-424) the Horde win some more Alterac Valley games.<br />

You can at least do something about it: let a Druid stealth through it and knock them off. Isle of Conquest however, Alliance can just exploit unto our own base and kill people from a safe place: the roof. Which is literally impossible for us to get to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zafire</div><div class="date">2014-02-18, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know why MoP is so bad with PVP. I started a Rogue in Cata. I had a pretty even win/loss ratio . After I summed everything up (I actually recorded this in a wordpad I still have), I had over 1000 games played and a 56% win ratio.<br />
<br />
The other day I was curious and I did some adding/subtracting. The sample size is still pretty low (125~ games played since MoP) but it's enough to see a pattern.<br />
<br />
My win ratio now is at a staggering 34%. I lose almost all games I play. All the new BG's besides Temple I have a 25-33% win rate. Temple is about even at 50/50. Strand of the Ancients is less than 20%. I've only lost a couple of Isle games, winning almost 90% of those. Arathi is at an all-time low, at roughly 43%. I used to win Arathi in cata pretty regularly.<br />
<br />
Some things I've noticed. In Arathi, Horde always seem to win by taking BS/Farm/LM. They can hang around the middle and get to either three in less than 10 seconds. Farm also has a great view of BS flag while stables does not. You can also get from LM to BS with slow fall pretty quickly while having a great view of attackers. They should add a bridge from ST to BS and erase the cliff over the flag, making it a hill like from horde side. Also, make mines on a hill like LM. Only way to balance Arathi, I think. That, or randomize which side starts out where.<br />
<br />
I have NO freakin' idea what is going on with SoTA since MoP. I used to win just fine in Cata. I would even play it nonstop on BG weekend with good results. I have seriously only won FOUR SoTA's since S14 and I've played 25. One win was due to neither side being able to get the relic and Alliance happened to be defending second.<br />
<br />
Statistics are fun, but mine aren't. PVP as an alliance is god awful in MoP.</div></div><hr />

It was sorta needed. While you can draw a a line as Alliance and hold it. Horde was a leaky bucket in that regard. Even if you made a line you always had people ninja capping your back line.<br />

<br />
Wait a second...let's take a look into my crystal ball. Wow....it shows a big, fat &quot;NO!&quot;. What a surprise.<br />
<br />
Seriously, the results in Isle of Conquest and Alterac are not going to change as long as the alliance always wins if both sides are equally skilled and both just go for the main goal of the BG(so essentially playing PvE instead of PvP). It's a known fact for about 6 years that the horde win rate increases dramatically once they have a serious defending force and getting into pvp....unfortunately most of the horde still behave like lemmings following bots down a cliff(and to be fair...if the horde would start at the ally-point then the allies would behave similar stupid!).<br />
This is not going to change by adding a third choke point if just nobody is defending anyway at the other 2 either. Not to mention that this choke point is NOT comparable to the bridge and the curve in/near the ally base either. What they need to do is slowing down the speed that allies can rush downward, change the bridge...and actually give players incentives to defend and pvp instead of doing mindless pve-rushes. As long as players believe that mindless PvE rushes are the fastest/best way and they win just once in a blue moon that way(like horde does) they will keep doing that(&quot;Oh, I lost the last 8 games? But yesterday we won one....so let's rush again, it's fast and we can win.&quot;. Sounds stupid? Well...it is...but I heard that kind of argument about 100 times in AV to the point where I stopped playing my most beloved BG alltogether)....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so, figures show Alliance get annihilated on EVERY map apart from AV.. . so they nerf AV?<br />
Don't they think that maybe Horde doesn't do so well there as every horde who does PVP regularly has it blacklisted?<br />
Next they'll be nerfing Isle of Conquest because its unfair for Horde having to send one person to destroy Glaives.<br />
<br />
So you think allies deserve unfair advantages cause they can't win on mirror maps? Fair competition isn't your thing, right? ;-)<br />
Maybe if the allies couldn't just do mindless PvE-rushes in AV and Isle of Conquest you would actually see some skilled dudes in other BGs again and the win rate for allies there would increase....just a thought.</div></div><hr />

This has been a long time coming like Vanilla long time, and this shows why asymmetrical multiplayer maps are almost impossible to balance. We have been yelling at Blizzard to fix this and it only took them 9 years.<br />

Most of the maps aren't mirrors. Arathi Basin is not a mirror map. Horde has a bridge between Farm/BS if they run a straight line, Alliance has water between ST/BS if they run a straight line.<br />
<br />
WSG/Twin peaks is not a mirror map. The Horde base is downhill from the alliance base, making things like Disengage and Heroic Leap take people further because coming from alliance-&gt;Horde base actually gains you distance if you use abilities like those. If you jump off from the top of the alliance base in either TP or WSG with a parachute, you will get taken most of the way back to the horde base. If you do that from the Horde base to the Alliance base, well...you can't in TP, and you don't get very far in WSG. Very subtle difference, just proving they're not equal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, we can talk about arathi.....but in case of TP and WSG that is hardly a game breaking difference. How do you want to explain the 65% win rate for horde in SotA there?<br />
The definitely loopsided BGs are currently AV and IoC simply cause allies can PvE rush them while horde has to go PvP-zerg for a serious chance to win...so expecting a different playstyle and time investment from both faction. Then you have arathi which would need some minor tweaks(well the bridge thing, which then would need one at the other side towards mines for horde as well. The current meta is mostly players fault tho...mines are much worse than sawmill, still alliance goes for mines). The rest is more or less fine....</div></div><hr />

I've already seen some great AV games thanks to these changes - 70% have been lengthy battles including one that went on for 40 minutes. Seeing Horde defend more is great, even if we lose. I have high hopes for next expac's AV, maybe they'll get the tuning of the NPCs right and they'll be tough from the start instead of falling over upon targeting them.</div></div><hr />

It took 8 years, but we finally got the gap in the fence and the hill removed! Now they just need to fix the positioning of either the paths or the NPCs in the Horde base, give Horde wider towers with flags the archers can see and fill in the trench between Snowfall and the Ally base and we'll have a decent map. Maybe in 2022.<br />
<br />
But on the fun side of things, I'd really like to see them change the summons so they're quicker to activate and for the damage and HP they have to be boosted so they're effective if they are summoned. <br />
Today horde tried. As soon as we saw a turtle was forming at Iceblood we started collecting blood (took about 15 minutes to collect and turn in), got the shamans to the summoning circle, and pulled 10 people to do the summon, and for all that Lok got to spend about 2 minutes dancing around in the middle before the match ended via resources. If we'd been trying to do the other summons, we'd never have even gotten that far. Even the longest matches just don't have the time to be able to get those summons off and they're the best part of AV.</div></div><hr />

&quot;We finally got your walls working! Now defend or lose!&quot;<br />
<br />
So Horde is once again forced to defend in order to win, just like the old days.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day if 0 Horde is defending and both sides play the ZERG game, the Horde archers aren't gonna do anything, Alliance will zerg with 40 and with no Hordes/Alliance wanting to defend/turtle, what's the deference?<br />
<br />
Horde, enjoy getting raped in AV yet again, because if you defend/turtle, Alliance will just do the same to you at their base after they die, and with their INVINCIBLE FORTRESS, good luck winning AV with a full pug grp.<br />
<br />
What a DISGRACE Blizzard.</div></div><hr />
