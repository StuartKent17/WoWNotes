A couple of people linked me the following post from the tech support forum.<br />
We only provide mirror links for full client patches. Background downloads do not count. You have around 1+ month to download this file so we're not really worried about your speed. :) <br />
<br />
Apparently, we have 1 month+ to download the patch on the background downloader before it hits the live servers ... And since a lot of people asked my opinion about that, I'll try to provide you with a decent answer. To be honest I doubt this information is true, most of the items are now implemented, the heroic modes are here, and new builds do not really add any new content. Blizzard already posted about pretty much everything (even Shadowmourne). <br />
<br />
Actually the only &quot;missing&quot; parts of the patch are the Season 8 Armor Sets (the weapon models are here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/titles-season-8-weapon-blue-posts/)) and the end of the Icecrown Citadel storyline. <br />
<br />
The end of the Arthas / Lich King storyline will not be used in-game before months because of the Icecrown Citadel Raid Access Progression (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/icecrown-citadel-raid-access-progression/), we won't see Arthas before months and there isn't any reason to include the end of the Icecrown Citadel in this patch. The Season 8 probably won't start before a few weeks either (it's been running for 11 weeks, the average duration of a WotLK season is 17~18 weeks). <br />
<br />
At this point I would say that we can expect the patch in mid-December, on December 15th or December 8th maybe, with another minor patch after the holidays to complete / bugfix everything. Of course if something goes wrong it could ultimately postpone the release to 2010 but so far the PTR builds do not look too bugged. Keep in mind that it's just an estimation, not an information.<br />

Bosstiary: The Frozen Halls<br />
They say that knowledge can be a greater boon than even the most powerful spells, or armor, or weapons. The battles that lie ahead beyond the gates of Icecrown will test your mettle like none before, and you will need all the help you can get. So arm yourself with knowledge, and discover the truth about the dangers that await you within the Frozen Halls in our new Icecrown Dungeon Bosstiary: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/3p3/dungeon-bosstiary.html <br />
<br />
<br />
The Heart and Souls of Icecrown Citadel<br />
With the final battle against the Lich King just on the horizon, Lead Content Designer Cory Stockton and Lead Systems Designer Greg Street discuss what awaits players inside Icecrown Citadel and offer a glimpse at the design process behind Wrath of the Lich King's ultimate raid and dungeon encounters.<br />
<br />
What were you looking forward to most about developing Icecrown Citadel?<br />
<br />
Cory: I think the most exciting thing about developing Icecrown Citadel was just knowing that we were working on the final chapter of the Northrend expansion, and that we'd really be able to give players that ultimate sense of completion of the storyline. Arthas is a huge character in Warcraft lore, so we took a lot of pride in making this the best experience we possibly could.<br />
<br />
Icecrown and the Frozen Throne are important parts of the world of Azeroth and have quite a bit of history, especially for longtime Warcraft players. How do you convey the significance of these places and the events that took place there in design?<br />
<br />
Cory: History was a large factor in the design of Icecrown Citadel from the very beginning. When we first sat down to discuss the layout of the raid itself, we immediately went back to Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne to think about how the spire from the ending cinematic could be translated into World of Warcraft. We decided to actually build Icecrown Citadel around the original spire to pull players even more into the storyline. This kind of thinking carried on throughout the entire design process.<br />
<br />
Greg We want Icecrown to be an epic experience from top to bottom, and that includes the loot you get. We're not going to shower players in items -- well, more than we already do -- but we do want to make sure the items are sufficiently powerful so that they're upgrades for all of our players.<br />
<br />
Is there an existing model in World of Warcraft for Icecrown Citadel's itemization or style of play? What lessons that you'd learned from earlier projects wound up being applied to Icecrown Citadel?<br />
<br />
Greg The nice thing about Icecrown Citadel from an itemization perspective is that we have lots of bosses. That's something of a relief coming from the Crusaders' Coliseum, where we had only five bosses. For Icecrown, we can afford to have multiple options for a particular slot -- say a healing leather bracer or a melee trinket -- and even itemize some of the more unusual pieces. We have a pretty effective system for figuring out who is going to drop what to make sure that an individual boss will be interesting to a variety of players in terms of loot. Most of our lessons learned are in the realm of what differences there should be between 10- and 25-player itemization, the role of tradeskill recipes, and what kinds of items to place with badge vendors.<br />
<br />
Cory: I think we learn lessons from every raid that we do. We didn't model Icecrown specifically after any of our previous raids, but you can definitely see influences. For example, we have a winged structure in Icecrown that players will remember from Naxxramas. Another example of an influence would be the teleporters from Ulduar. We know that players really loved that concept, so we brought it back in Icecrown.<br />
<br />
Can you talk a little about how artists and designers on the team collaborated on the creation of Icecrown Citadel?<br />
<br />
Cory: The design and art teams worked extremely closely throughout the entire development process. The biggest single influence on the look and the layout of the dungeon comes from our concept art, and there was no shortage of that for Icecrown Citadel. Once we locked down the layout, we were able to get to work on the final art extremely quickly thanks to the existing style we'd developed for the Icecrown zone. We really wanted the players to feel connected to the environment, but we wanted to make sure it still had an amazing look. Often times, these two things are hard to mix, but in this case, I think we've been able to pull off an amazing dungeon from both the art and design standpoint.<br />
<br />
What sorts of new loot and item abilities will we see in Icecrown?<br />
<br />
Greg There are three main sources of loot for Icecrown: the bosses themselves, the Emblem of Frost badge vendors, and a new faction, the Ashen Verdict, that will provide suitable rewards as well, particularly at the Exalted level.<br />
<br />
As far as the items themselves go, we want them to feel epic. In addition to having favorable optimization, we also want to try a lot of experiments to make the items feel cool and unique. We are going to try to do a lot of weapon procs, for instance, which is something we haven't done much since the original World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
When you set out to itemize &quot;sister&quot; areas -- like the Icecrown Citadel dungeon and raid, or Halls of Stone, Halls of Lightning, and Ulduar -- do you take any steps to make loot from these places feel similar?<br />
<br />
Greg Absolutely. We approach that on two fronts: the art and the names. When we did the Halls of Stone and Lightning, we hadn't completed the Ulduar raid yet, so the items there didn't necessarily have Titan-influenced art models for us to use. We are doing the Icecrown dungeon at the same time as the raid, and it's a style we already know pretty well, from Naxxramas and even the Warcraft RTS games.<br />
<br />
Naming is something we've had a lot of fun with. There's a ton of lore to draw from for Icecrown loot and it has a very strong &quot;kit.&quot; World of Warcraft players know to associate the Scourge with spiders, bats, and cultists along with more traditional forms of undead, like skeletons and liches.<br />
<br />
Do you itemize Icecrown's &quot;trash&quot; -- the enemies between bosses -- differently from elites elsewhere in the world?<br />
<br />
Greg We make sure there is epic trash loot -- specific items that only drop from trash. It helps keep players interested between bosses. However, we aren't doing Heroic trash, just Heroic bosses, so there won't be unique trash loot for Heroic versions of the 10- and 25-player versions of the raid. We try to construct the trash in such a way that it isn't trivial to go farm the first pull or whatever in hopes that an epic drops. We make our raids more accessible now in general, so I'm not sure the motivation is there to try stunts like that the way it once was. We want players who have raided so far in Wrath of the Lich King to be able to actually fight the Lich King, so chances are a lot of raiders will have plenty of opportunities to gear up. Now, the Heroics are another story -- those will be as challenging as they were in Ulduar and Trial of the Crusader, and the items will likewise be even better.<br />
<br />
What have you done to make the tier-10 sets feel like a meaningful advancement from tier 8 and tier 9? How do they visually represent Icecrown's lore and history?<br />
<br />
Greg Not only do we want them to be a meaningful advancement, but we want them to feel really awesome. This is Arthas loot you're talking about. We started by spending a lot of time on the concept art to make sure it tied into the type of creatures you'll encounter and the whole Icecrown art &quot;kit&quot; in general. For example, the rogue tier-10 set has a strong geist look to it, while the hunter set has strong Nerubian elements, and the mage set looks a lot like the Blood Princes. You can see the Icecrown look and feel in a lot of pieces, which itself drew strongly from the Lich King's original helmet. Look for lots of blue, ice, skulls, and spikes.<br />
<br />
We have also spent a lot longer on the set bonuses than we usually do. It's important that they feel awesome for every class and spec. Going back to the Crusaders' Coliseum, part of the challenge we made for ourselves was to create an instance that didn't require as much time or resources as Ulduar to develop, yet was still cool. We had set bonuses for the tier-9 gear, but they were often simple -- more crit on a common ability was a typical one. For tier 10, we're really going for set bonuses that change your game up a little. At the very least, you should want to change your rotation a little, though this is easier with some classes than others.<br />
<br />
If you had something like a mission statement or a slogan for itemizing Icecrown, what would it be?<br />
<br />
Greg Epic. Cool things. Proc'y stuff.<br />
<br />
Seriously, that's our mission statement. One of the risks of itemization is making things feel too formulaic. We know that when we step outside the bounds too much, players can have a bad reaction to it, like, &quot;Why does my gear for this tier suck?&quot; It's easy to fall into the trap of making the new gear feel just like the last gear with 20 more stat points. That is the exact design approach we use for the PvP gear, and left unchecked, it would be easy to go the same direction with the PvE gear as well. We're trying not to do that. We think we owe it to Icecrown for the gear to be memorable, but that means we're going to take a few chances.<br />
<br />
Can you talk about any of the new mechanics we'll see in the raid?<br />
<br />
Cory: One of the coolest new things we're doing in Icecrown is the gunship air battle. Players will be able to board their respective faction's gunship and then take to the air for a battle to the top of the citadel. They'll be fighting on the decks as well as using vehicles' cannon emplacements. If you're really daring, you can put on a goblin rocket pack and propel yourself back and forth between the two battling gunships. Needless to say, this will be a type of encounter that our players have never experienced before.<br />
<br />
Icecrown Citadel's structure is extremely vertical -- what challenges does that present from a layout perspective?<br />
<br />
Cory: Well, we knew from the start that the layout was going to be vertical, just due to the nature of the original spire. There are a number of things that we're doing to help players get around and not get lost. We're using elevators, teleporters, and even gunships to get players where they need to go in the dungeon. We are also going to have an in-game map with full support for all floors -- that should help too.<br />
<br />
Icecrown is the last major raid and dungeon before the release of Cataclysm -- how has that affected the design?<br />
<br />
Greg The major challenge from an itemization perspective is that the items have to last basically until Cataclysm. That means we can't afford to give them away too quickly, but they also need to feel powerful enough that players are motivated to keep trying for them. On the other hand, the really fun thing about doing a final raid tier is how it unties your hands. We can afford to make these items great because nothing needs to follow on their heels. It's cool to be able to optimize the items very well, because it's okay if players don't want to replace these items for a long time.<br />
<br />
Cory: We are really pushing as hard as we can to deliver the most epic experience possible. We know that our players have been waiting for this for a long time, and we plan to deliver. Everyone should expect to see this sort of storytelling and attention to detail in Cataclysm as well. I think we are always striving to pull the people who play our game into the storyline and really give them an explanation for why they're there. It won't be too long before they'll get a chance to bring the pain to Deathwing!<br />
<br />
Thanks, both of you - we're looking forward to playing through Icecrown Citadel after patch 3.3 is released!</div></div><hr />

i don't think they'll be including them in this patch to be honest, last patch they were implemented as the pve sets were and they haven't implemented models in a couple of weeks or so, so it doesn't seem likely</div></div><hr />

<br />
Due to the gating system, it'll probably be impossible to gear up in full tier 10.5 in the first two months of 3.3, so there's still plenty of warning time if Blizzard decide to take away the proto-drakes in Ulduar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since they'll release a wing every couple of weeks and there's four of them, obviously the final wing won't be this year. They'd have had to release the patch like yesterday to do that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
just wait and see... first wing on 15th december, second wing on 22nd december, 3rd on 29th december.<br />
I even know we got some kill on 29th december... I think OS 3D in 25 man.<br />
4th and last wing on 5th january, then next week BOOM hard modes.<br />
<br />
also the patch itself is around 1.5gb.<br />
we got a 448mb file so far. we might get another 400mb file and boom 3.3 is live.<br />
they will probably add the rest during the weeks.<br />
just my 2 cents :P</div></div><hr />

I don't think a major content drop like this would work during the holiday season. Its probably the one time of the year people actually take time off to be away from the game, and while a lot of sensible people would still take the time off, there's always going to be those hardcore people who &quot;cancel Christmas&quot; to get world/server first kills of whichever wing(s) are released by then. It puts some people who want to have a fair shot at showing off their guild's raiding abilities at a disadvantage, if they have to be raiding during the holidays just to get those kills.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to say that I am in no way a hardcore raider, never cleared Ulduar and only did ToC10 once. Just pointing out a reason why we could (and imo should) be getting the patch in 2010.</div></div><hr />

Invincible drops off Arthas, this has already been confirmed via the added Feat of Strength involved with it.<br />
<br />
The blood princes in the vision were the same ones that were the bosses we saw - well, 2 bosses and 1 world quest kill.<br />
<br />
Arthas' Lts. Marwyn and Falric are in Halls of Reflection 5-man instance.<br />
<br />
Arthas should be counted in the 'last' wing I believe, past Sindragosa.<br />
<br />
As for when, I was hoping Dec. 1st. I wonder if there's a hold up in S8's designs, and if they're also waiting partly because of trying to see if any other issues/balance problems pop up, or if it's because they don't want to roll it TOO soon in regards to S8's start, since last time Koralon was held up 2 weeks waiting on the new seasons, and this intros yet another -on boss for us - Toralon the Ice Watcher. (Also, have they even TESTED him? Do we even know what he LOOKS like? (Although like a Son of Hodir seems the fastest answer...)<br />
<br />
Maybe the Ice Watcher is the hold up too - anyone consider what happened to him? Did they even test Koralon? I can't honestly remember...</div></div><hr />

What the OP didn't take into account is the fact, most guilds are still working on Heroic Anub, and Tribute Chests, etc. Blizzard wants this content played by the vast majority, not the 3% to 5% of the current guilds that have this content down.<br />
<br />
Also, if you look at the current PVP arena season, one plus month from now puts it in line with the length of other seasons, something else the OP didn't take into account.<br />
<br />
If you are sitting there expecting 3.3 to come out in a few weeks, I wouldn't hold my breath if I were LOL. Expect 3.3 to go live no sooner that 1+ months from now. Another clue is the addition of + to the month. The plus clearly means to show the blue poster was not even sure if it will be a month.</div></div><hr />

The devs said a while back that there would be no &quot;Sunwell&quot; for WoTLK. That meaning, a random raid designed because they released BT too early and WoTLK was way far away in the horizon. It sounds like you could probably expect Cata by June. They're just trying to make sure they give enough time between Arthas and 4.0 (the cata bridge patch), that way there isn't a ton of time between ICC and cata. Also, they don't want another Naxx-40 mistake where there isn't enough time between release of ICC and cata. <br />
<br />
Of course, they could have just made gated progression to release the start of ICC earlier, but who knows.</div></div><hr />

If that's 4 and we are on the 11th week, it means that we are already virtualy on the 15th week.<br />

if seasons lasts 17-18 then it's certainly the 9 or 16 december.<br />
Except if this season lasts longer.<br />
<br />
<br />
And in my opinion don't hope one week between the opening of each ICC wing.<br />
I think (and hope) that it's gonna be one boss per week (like 3.2), 4 weeks for the first wing, ,3 for the second, ect...</div></div><hr />

7 months isn't enough time between last raid and an expansion? Because that's the time that was between Naxxramas and TBC. Naxx was released in June of 2006 and TBC in January of 2007.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully people will go back and do it like they are for Molten Core and Blackwing Lair.

There really is nothing more that needs to be added, recent builds have just been small tweaks, bugs are fast-disappearing. I'm inclined to agree that an early December patch is still most likely .<br />
<br />
But it may be delayed until January for a less obvious reason: This is primarily a raid patch, yet December is a terrible time for raiding. Many guilds are missing people over the holiday period. So a December Icecrown patch wouldn't be &quot;as fun&quot; as a January patch. We could be in the unusual position of the patch being finished in the next week or 2, but not actually being deployed until early January...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard lost China (around 6 million players). A great deal of their American/European base closed their accounts the second they finished gearing in ToC (most didn't even bother with ToGC because ICC 25 replaces all that loot anyways). So, in order to get people back into the game as quickly as possible they aren't going to delay the release of ICC. They are going to release it as soon as they can and delay the release of Arthas. As soon as Arthas is defeated, if the history of this expansion has been any clue, most of the people taking a break now will again cancel until Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Most guilds are on break waiting for ICC to come out. Most guilds don't really give a damn about hard modes. The 3-5% that actually wants to do hard modes has already done them. Most players already feel that true hard mode content is for the &quot;elites of the elites&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, if you look at the current PVP arena season, one plus month from now puts it in line with the length of other seasons, something else the OP didn't take into account.<br />

<br />
Actually, the season end has NEVER coincided with the release of a patch in the history of arena (going all the way to TBC). They ALWAYS end the season after the patch not with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are sitting there expecting 3.3 to come out in a few weeks, I wouldn't hold my breath if I were LOL. Expect 3.3 to go live no sooner that 1+ months from now. Another clue is the addition of + to the month. The plus clearly means to show the blue poster was not even sure if it will be a month.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its actually really simple (and I'm absolutely sure I'm not the only one that feels this way). When Blizzard wants my money they will release 3.3. Until they release 3.3 they will not get my money. I'm really tired of the way this game is going, but its still the best out there. I'm hoping in Cataclysm that they learn that smaller and faster patch releases are absolutely the way to go if you want to keep people interested in paying that $14.95 every month.</div></div><hr />

You must be the only one that hopes that way because the vast majority of people I have talked to thought that was the lamest thing possible. If they do one boss per week my bet is half the people raiding that are sick to death with ToC will just take enough weeks off that when they get back ICC will be fully released.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 85 you will be able to come back and solo the 10 man version of Uludar anyways. 3.3 will officially kill Uludar because the gear you get from heroics (ICC + normal heroics) will officially be better than the gear from Uludar anyways.</div></div><hr />

How do they visually represent Icecrown's lore and history?<br />
<br />
Greg Not only do we want them to be a meaningful advancement, but we want them to feel really awesome. This is Arthas loot you're talking about. We started by spending a lot of time on the concept art to make sure it tied into the type of creatures you'll encounter and the whole Icecrown art &quot;kit&quot; in general. For example, the rogue tier-10 set has a strong geist look to it, while the hunter set has strong Nerubian elements, and the mage set looks a lot like the Blood Princes. You can see the Icecrown look and feel in a lot of pieces, which itself drew strongly from the Lich King's original helmet. Look for lots of blue, ice, skulls, and spikes.<br />
<br />
We have also spent a lot longer on the set bonuses than we usually do. It's important that they feel awesome for every class and spec. Going back to the Crusaders' Coliseum, part of the challenge we made for ourselves was to create an instance that didn't require as much time or resources as Ulduar to develop, yet was still cool. We had set bonuses for the tier-9 gear, but they were often simple -- more crit on a common ability was a typical one. For tier 10, we're really going for set bonuses that change your game up a little. At the very least, you should want to change your rotation a little, though this is easier with some classes than others.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The reason I don't really agree with him this time around is because there's a lot of things Blizzard has said they'd want to do before 3.3, and haven't done yet. For example &quot;The disparity between totem of wrath and demonic pact is something we want to address before 3.3&quot;, &quot;pets should scale with all stats other than armor penetration in 3.3&quot;. Now don't get me wrong, I don't have my hopes up for those 2 things specfically still happening- but a lot of this stuff still feels very unfinished.<br />

From what i saw on PTR everything looks ready. Loot/bosses/LFG/5man heroics. They are saying 1month + because they dont wanna say the real release date. Lets say they reveal the real release date (random date) 15th December and they found critical bug or bugged item/spell that cant be fixed before 15th &gt; they have to extend the release date &gt; MASS QQ will fill the forums.<br />

Many users have quit since 3.2 came out seeing as it was a very band aid solution to try and appease users until 3.3 came out. It didn't work all that well, look around most hate ToC and want a new raid. Many have suspended their accounts until 3.3 and Blizzard knows this. The end of the 3rd quarter is December 16th and I guarantee they will want to boost their profits before it ends and what better way than to release a major patch, those renewed subscriptions will help make their profits that much better to the share holders. So count on it, I would almost guarantee December 8th at the latest. <br />
<br />
The statement in the interview with Ghostcrawler about the Holidays was posted on November 16th, remember Thanksgiving is coming first before Christmas. Not everyone takes three weeks off in December to spend with family before Christmas. I would imagine he was referring to the Thanksgiving weekend which would make sense. One last bit of info, look at the time between releases of the latest patches. 3.1 was release on April, 14th and 3.2 was release on August, 4th. Their is a 3 month gap and 3.2 has been out in December 4th for 4 months. I don't think Blizzard is going to drag on a filler patch like ToC for five months or more. If they do they have no concern for their customers or their investors because if what you say is true about the Holidays, some users will be on break and have more time on their hands. If they have nothing to play in World of Warcraft they will find other forms of entertainment. Not everyone spends every moment leading up to the holidays shopping or spending every moment with family.<br />
<br />
But in the end we shall see. These are all just my opinion but I think I'm going to be right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they probably would like the LFG system and leveling improvements live by Christmas. If we're talking crystal ball predictions, I think we might also see enhanced/updated Recruit a Friend and Scroll of Resurrection rewards along with the leveling improvements in December.<br />
<br />
Likewise, they might release the new 5 man stuff. And give notice that you have until January 12th for your Ulduar Drakes and the unveiling of ICC.<br />
<br />
Also predicting some unannounced, untested Winter's Veil tweaks, the plushie pet (as a Christmas promo) and a couple more Night Elf Mohawk style events before the end of 2009.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xentropy</div><div class="date">2009-11-21, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My prediction is that they might break up this patch into 2 pieces. First part released Dec 1. Wing 1 open that day, Wing 2 open is open on Dec 15th. A week is plenty of time for world firsts since this is regular modes only. Rest of Icecrown opens up after the holidays.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Several&quot; is more than two, by definition. The first wing will not unlock for at least 3 weeks after 3.3's push.<br />
<br />
As for the 3.3 patch, I'm going to have to disagree with Boub, though it's rare I do so. Look back two years at the 2.3.2 patch. It was on PTR and ready to go (basically NO new PTR builds) for over six weeks, but delayed from the end of November all the way through December for a Jan 8th release because of the holidays. Blizzard has avoided patches just before holidays for a long time, to avoid stressing out their technical support crew during that time. I'm guessing patch will be January 5th or 12th. I certainly wish/hope it'd be sooner, because I'm so sick of ToC25, but I doubt it will be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
MMO-Champ dropping the ball again. The post from Datth was made on the 18th. He says &quot;around 1+ month&quot; which could mean two weeks or seven weeks. Remember, Blizzard doesn't give out exact release dates more than a week or so ahead.<br />
<br />
Boub's guess is Dec 15th. Nov 18th - Dec 15th most certainly could equal &quot;around 1+ month&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First I agree with the OP, I think it will be December 1st or the 8th however. You have to remember that Blizzard likes to confuse their customers and put out random vague information as to when the patch will launch. Blizzard is the only company I can think of that can give their customers such BS lines and continue to have them come crawling back, I guess that's what happens when you make a fun game. But you also have to remember Blizzard is a business and businesses are in it to make money.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not giving out release dates has little to nothing to do with money. They don't give out dates for the same reason pawn shops don't give quotes over the phone. If something changes then people will bitch. You might think they could just say something like &quot;release date isn't final&quot; or &quot;subject to change&quot; but they're dealing with millions of people. It doesn't matter how they phrase it or how big of letters they use. People will always read between the lines and hold them to the strictest of interpretations. They learned a long time ago that the best solution to avoid thousands of posts, e-mails and phone calls was to simply not give release dates.<br />
<br />
Business? Yes. All about money? No.</div></div><hr />

Everything is pretty much ready in PTR for the initial release. The bosses in the first 3 wings have been tested and retested. Toravon was tested for a few weeks. The 5-man is complete. Items have been added to all the bosses and trash mobs in the new dungeons. The LFG system and quest system are finished as well. Other than a few additional items/bug fixes/stat adjustments there isn't much left to test.<br />
<br />
Other than Arthas in the raid, but they won't test that fight for a long time, no need to get a huge spoiler like that out until they absolutely have to.<br />
<br />
At this point the release date will be whenever Blizzard feels it's best to release the patch, and i can't imagine them waiting too much longer.</div></div><hr />

Recycled Naxx(admittedly liked it) Ulduar(One of the best raids ever made hands down) ToGC(Filler) and ICC(sure to be epic)<br />
<br />
It really feels like they funneled more time into quest development and the feel of northrend areas than they did Raids. Not complaining, i honestly love how it worked out, made for an incredibly enjoyable playing experience, but the raids dont measure up to the rest of the expansion quite how id hoped. Now with the delay of Icecrown it only threatens to rub players the wrong way and get them to quit. I think its because we've learned to expect more and more from them off the standards of Northrend, but waiting was never really a strength of ours.. :P<br />

I'm saying it's probably not going to be ready because a couple large changes they -claimed- were going live this patch aren't even up on the PTR yet, yes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cyloria</div><div class="date">2009-11-21, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I almost always agree with Boulb's predictions- this time around I don't. Probably for the first time in a year or so (Mind you,I didn't believe for a moment that his only source for the &quot;goblins and worgen will be the next playable races&quot; were the masks, I was pretty sure from the start that he had different sources for that).<br />
<br />
The reason I don't really agree with him this time around is because there's a lot of things Blizzard has said they'd want to do before 3.3, and haven't done yet. For example &quot;The disparity between totem of wrath and demonic pact is something we want to address before 3.3&quot;, &quot;pets should scale with all stats other than armor penetration in 3.3&quot;. Now don't get me wrong, I don't have my hopes up for those 2 things specfically still happening- but a lot of this stuff still feels very unfinished.<br />
<br />
Yesterday (before this post) someone asked me in game when I expect the patch coming, I said probably a bit over a month. So this was a suspicion I already had before Blizzard posted about it too.<br />

they didn't say they wanted to fix TOW before 3.3 they said before 4.0..people seem to want to read things into things, to see what they want to see.</div></div><hr />

[edit] I found the blue post:<br />
<br />
We want to solve the discrepancy between ToW and DP before Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
You're completely right, they didn't say it would be fixed @ patch 3.3.0. Honestly though I can't see them fixing it in a &quot;mini patch&quot; because any such change would have pretty big implications on gearing, scaling, and raid formation. I guess that as a result of the &quot;not a minor patch&quot; assumption I just sort of read &quot;3.3.0&quot;- I suppose before Cataclysm will just mean &quot;@ 4.0, when the new talents are released but the expansion isn't yet&quot;.</div></div><hr />
