<br />
Patch 7.3.2 - November 28 Hotfixes<br />
In addition to the PvP hotfixes posted last night (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7220-PvP-Hotfixes-with-Weekly-Maintenance), Shadow Priests had some changes.<br />
<br />
Priest<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
<br />
Void Eruption (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/228260) no longer deals a separate damage event for each of your Shadow Word: Pain or Vampiric Touch on each target. Instead, it now deals a single damage event to all targets that have either your Shadow Word: Pain or Vampiric Touch.<br />
Void Eruption (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/228260) damage increased by 700%.<br />
Shadow Crash (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205385) cooldown reduced to 20 seconds (was 30 seconds), Insanity generation increased to 20 (was 15), and Missile speed increased by 60%.<br />
Mind Sear (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48045) (Passive) damage increased by 50%.<br />
Heart of the Void (Legendary) increases Void Eruption’s damage by 75% (was 300%) and heals you for 25% (was 40%) of the damage done.<br />
<br />
Developers’ note: This is compensation for the Void Eruption buff. The overall effect is mostly neutral.<br />
<br />
Shadow Word: Pain (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/589) damage reduced by 4%.<br />
Vampiric Touch (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/34914) damage reduced by 4%.<br />
<br />
Developers’ note: This is compensation for the Void Eruption buff in extended fights.</div></div><hr />

It is likely because the model wasn't finished on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are getting rid of our artifacts after that point, so I would assume we are combining all those to destroy the sword and cauterize the wound.<br />
<br />
(They mentioned we are getting rid of artifact weapons in a very epic manner, so it's very likely we'll be doing that).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Illidan wouldn't stand a chance in a 1v1 against Sargeras. Sargeras would tear his limbs apart like an insect.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the pantheon if they didn't have a sliver of Argus power left, they couldn't even jail them themselves.</div></div><hr />

Corrupting Azeroth, similar to how he probably corrupted Argus when he first arrived.</div></div><hr />

Sargeras' dialogue was basically &quot;aaaaaaah. oooooooh.&quot; - as if he was some sort of Ogre. This is the guy we have been fighting since 1994, the main big bad (until recently) of the entire universe. No epic showdown between the Titans and the Dark Titan Sargeras, just them firing a rainbow beam and dragging him in. Why not show us more of the titans? More of Sargeras full-body? Give him a booming, epic, clear and menacing voice with a few cool lines? Why not show us a bit more of them and Illidan imprisoning him? <br />
<br />
For the conclusion cinematic to the main villain since day 1, this felt nowhere near as climactic and epic as it should have been. This does not do the Burning Legion nor Sargeras justice at all.</div></div><hr />

Like what? He has one line from wotlk, a laugh, a few lines of dialouge in the final raid and then he just vanishes? Argus who's pretty much a no name being the final boss is also a joke, I think they should have had another boss. Wouldn't it maybe be more epic if the titans charged all of their Powers into Argus or Illidan or something, then we get a deathwing style fight, where we see Argus/Illidan fight sargeras in the distance while we run and defend titans until they can regain some of their Powers and weaken sargeras until they can imprison him then or atleast banish him.<br />
<br />
Also, if Sargeras suposedly killed all the titans single handedly, why can they suddenly, even when one titan short defeat him even when their physical bodies are destroyed</div></div><hr />

Agree, the reason warcraft as a game exists in the first Place is because of him influencing medivh into opening the first dark portal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I agree that Sargeras is too powerful in his normal form, he looks like he's been weakened by the Pantheon in that scene. At least it looks like that, I see no reason why Illidan would grab his glaives tighter and say &quot;at last&quot; if he didn't have any chances with him or didn't want to fight. For sure he just jumped into that portal/fog and went 1v1 with him.<br />
<br />
Though I could be wrong and there's no real reason why Illidan would stay there... (othar than - Enough with Illidan in WoW! Give him an proper ending!)<br />

Even a weakened titan would annihilate Illidan. Not too mention the only reason Sargeras is imprisoned is because they used the last of Argus' power to jail him, Illidan is a guard, but he is not the jailer.</div></div><hr />

i wouldnt say many of them have been very good tbh<br />
<br />
&quot;there must always be a lich king&quot; was a cop out.<br />
<br />
the cataclysm one was ruined by focusing on thrall's baby<br />
<br />
pandaria was actually ok it was neat how they had one for alliance and one for horde<br />
<br />
and then in draenor we have &quot;draenor is free&quot;. i think we were all just glad to be done with it and i say we including we the players, blizzard the developers, and the npcs themselves who were forced to exist in warlords of draenor<br />
<br />
at least for this legion ending they showed uncommon restraint by not having illidan say &quot;he is not prepared...&quot; at the end. good job blizzard. please give yourselves a round of applause<br />

Yes because besides destroying all life Sargeras is also known for being interested in cartography and should know the exact location of the Horde capital.<br />
<br />
he has eyes my dude you can see them in the cutscene. he could use them to see and process that visual information to pick a good place to stab his gigantic million foot long sword</div></div><hr />

You're just looking for something to bitch about &quot;my dude&quot;.. He didn't have time to pick a juicy target... or did he? Considering Silithus is not just any zone.<br />
<br />
You fail to take his size and speed in to consideration. It looks slow but try scaling it down.</div></div><hr />

You realize that Silithus is a way more dangerous target than a random town right? He will have poked Gorshalach right into a hotbed of Qiraji and Old God shit. That has a lot more impact than taking out some settlement.<br />

i mean lets consider it really. this guy just got all his plans ruined by a group that was probably mostly horde. if i were him i would stab orgrimmar its clearly the bigger threat. he could even try thunder bluff. even if he wanted to kill the old gods for some reason he hit the druid town instead of ahn'qiraj. so clearly you are mistaken.<br />
<br />
maybe it was an alliance raid that killed him. he could try to hit teldrassil in that case but it seems like that would be more awkward for him to hit. he is right in front of orgrimmar in the cutscene so it would have been no problem</div></div><hr />

You do realize C'Thun's tentacles stretch across the entire zone of Silithus right? I never said he hit Ahn'Qiraj, I said he hit Qiraji shit - there's a giant hive under the whole zone. I never even said he was trying to hit anything in particular.<br />
<br />
He probably wasn't even trying to hit anything, considering his sword can cut whole plants in half. He was likely trying to stab Azeroth and then channel power through Gorribal to destroy a large portion of the planet.</div></div><hr />

nah man. you arent putting yourself in his shoes. it doesnt matter where cthuns tentacles are everyone knows you would aim for his gigantic eye and that is under ahn qiraj. so that is where he would aim.<br />

That's unlikely for Mythic mode / additional boss. The cinematic clearly shows the portal closing, Illidan and Sargeras are on the other side, lore-wise we're not supposed to see Argus any more after that.<br />

We still have a few months if not a year worth of legion left before bfa, they said no more raids not no more content. I can see a questllne dealing with the sword etc. as for Illidan he doesn't absorb him, he is serving as a jailer, the patheon bound him to his former throne from the looks of it, which is good, keeps with the notion that we cannot and honestly should not &quot;kill&quot; sargeras.</div></div><hr />

Yes I understand that with their ilvl and experience it's possible. Still, I don't think it should be so easy, even if it's only on normal. For many people, there is no point of clearing the raid on higher difficulties once you kill the last boss. Something like this should take a bit longer...</div></div><hr />

They turned the power of Argus against Sargeras<br />

They couldn't do that from the start for the same reason you can't just ride the eagles to Mordor.<br />

How he's a guard? That doesn't make any sense. If the Sargeras break free he'd just kill him immediately. I'd rather see Illidan in Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's due to their indecisiveness to build up proper characters/story over the years because they are afraid new and coming back players would find it gated/confusing to follow. Because of that, stories are fragmented and characters are simple enough to be described under a paragraph, even the major villain. And I'm sure they are fine with it because many players are gameplay foremost over story.<br />
<br />
That's why we can kind of describe Sargeras but zero investment other than respecting him as biggest baddie since beginning of Warcraft. Honestly you all should've seen this coming, Sargeras is a hollow character with just a background tied to beginning of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The raid only drops 930 gear on normal. These guys already have average ilvl of 945.<br />
<br />
The type of people who only want to clear it and beat the last boss once and then never move on to any higher difficulty are not the people who will be able to clear normal today. The people clearing normal today (or this week) will be the guilds that will move on to higher difficulties. The only way to have enough gear to clear it this quickly is to have done Heroic or Mythic Tomb.</div></div><hr />

He only had seconds to act because he was about to be pulled away. Azeroth's heart is INSIDE the planet. He won't hurt it if he punches the core. That's why he needed to stab deeply. He did not have time for a precise aim, so he acted desperately.</div></div><hr />

Short version from the Chronicle Vol One book and storyline from MoP about the Thunder King. <br />

Last we know of the Titians. Sargaras believe he kill them all long ago. But just before he &quot;killed&quot; them, Norgannon cast a spell that send their spirits into the Great Dark. Where they later when into the Keepers on Azeroth. But not much was left The Keepers just got a quick influx of power and some fragmented memories, than in all faded. Later one of the Keeper, Ra, find out in was the last remnant of the Titan powers and he have what was left of Aman'Thul's. Ra than when into hiding till Lei Shen found he and demand to know what happen to Ra. Ra told and than Lei Shen took the last of Aman'Thul's power for himself and become the Thunder King. Years later we kill Lei Shen and we give the power to Wrathion. So the Titian are dead, and very little of their powers is in the Keepers. So how are they back?<br />
<br />
So yeah they got their work cut out for them lol.</div></div><hr />

I agree, this is kind of...lame. Sarg has been built up for so long, as a mystery figure who cuts planets in half, the god who went feral...and this? He gets &quot;Nooooooo!&quot; as his legacy? (Serious, he looked like he was going to have &quot;relations&quot; with the planet, with the way they staged that.) This guy was going to need an Army Of Light to defeat...and he gets a fucking skybeam? ANOTHER FUCKING SKYBEAM. And yet again, the players get no sense of threat from him, he's offstage until the end, just like Arthas, just like Deathwing. <br />
<br />
There's no reverence. No honor. No respect. Metzen would never have allowed Sarg to be Ion's bitch, like this. This is a means to an end, not a story that's crafted with love and passion and respect. Sarg is just another raid boss now. Don't take characters or lore too seriously anymore, because the devs sure as hell aren't. The WoW devs no longer make games made by gamers that care. They just don't give a fuck anymore, and it's showing. Lets just sweep Sarg off the stage, we're bored with him, and go back to FOR THE HORDE HURR DURR. Because the planet only has a giant fucking sword sticking out of it, which would change the tides and trigger massive earthquakes and tsunamies and possibly change the orbit of the planet, no, it makes total sense to ignore that and focus on the sandbox slapfights of the cardboard standup characters you'e devolved anyone interesting into. Yeah. That totally works. <br />
<br />
Fucking devs. Just when I think they can't sink lower, they go and do it. Fucking Mario Brothers has more respect for their lore than these dullards do. I'm officially done giving a fuck about WoW lore. I just don't care anymore. It's shit storytelling, and it's only getting worse - and now you fools will have to deal with that hack Christy Golden's shitting all over lore, too. And more skybeams.

Yea, i'm with you.<br />
<br />
The cinematic quality is top tier, as always, but it's just weird as hell. So, after not being anywhere, Sargeras just pops up in space to stab Azeroth? And then get's ghostbustered into his old pantheon chair? And how isn't that major sword trespassing a planet a big deal from the get go? Like, extinction level event?<br />

I liked Argus a lot. It is quite buggy though. We had the death cone from phase one never despawn leaving half the floor unable to be used for the rest of the fight. I even tested to make sure it wasn’t just a visual bug, but no, standing in it still killed you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoce4a9f54a9f</div><div class="date">2017-11-29, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those dev jerks should start to invest in some professional and talented writers and storytellers. The cinematic works in its own way, but there's also tons of trouble with it. I know the lore around Sargeras and what he looks like, but there's been not enough buildup over the expansion up to this point where he's pulled out of the cloud. Someone who would go by in-game presented lore alone and had joined just recently would probably experience the whole thing as pretty outta the left field and disjointed. Epic, but disjointed. Suprise maddafakka, been a big red fiery god-demon hiding in dat huge cloud the whole time, showing myself in the last 10 seconds of the endscene!<br />
<br />
And it might have needed a bigger battle scenario to do this situation justice. Some posters here already had proposals what that could have instead looked like, and they sounded pretty alright, it's not too hard to come up with something. What is in game now is not bad gameplay and presentation wise, this criticism is about the lore-telling aspect.<br />
<br />
Blizzard team already said that they don't focus a lot on storytelling, they rather take cool themes and motives and weave them together in a way to try to create epic moments. Ofc they try to be cohesive, but they have a lot of issues when it comes to longterm storytelling and plotlines. Because they don't invest in professional storytellers who might have better visions about where to go with the lore, and maybe more importantly, how to get there.<br />
<br />
This might also lead to more cohesive evil factions, cause so far some of the bad guys felt a bit jumbled together. Green fire and -sludge &quot;demon&quot;-offworldlers in league with other subjugated, demonized offworld races which look more classical demon (Nethrazim, Pitlords), but have star-destroyers and zip around sky and space, and it's too much neon green everywhere, then the final bossguy is electric blue-golden and sargeras himself is a classical burning red lava guy. It just seems like an old He-Man toybox thrown together. Which is its own mark of actually fun, but not necessarily a matured design. (It doesn't matter if the game is about elfs, magic, gnomes, it can still be designed in more incoherent, seemingly whatever-comes-to-mind ways and more overall composed ways.)<br />
<br />
Very solid expansion all in all, but the lore-thing just annoys me, they have some excellent stuff in their world-building, but character and plot arcs leave a lot to be desired.</div></div><hr />

You guys just dont understand,and in fairness the cinematic doesnt make some things clear,here are a few point that some people are not getting:<br />
<br />
1.Sargeras had no body,he hasnt had one in a long time,the cloud was him,im going to asume in the raid we see how he gets to azeroth,the pantheon remade his body with the power from argus so they can seal him,it is actualy kinda clear in the cinematic his body wasnt complete,he has no legs.<br />
<br />
2.Did you seriously want another spine of deathwing 2.0 just more extreme?I didnt,the idea of us figthing against sargeras is simply ilogical,we just can't,he he didnt even have a body,did you want to fight smoke?or his toenails?what would you prefer?he beat all the other titans when they were at their best,the only way they were able to seal him now is because they were in their seats that act as a conduit and they have the imense power of argus.<br />
<br />
3.This was decided long ago how it will go down,im 100% sure Metzen knew it and was probably his idea lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1) That he has no body is pure speculation that doesn't have an actual source, they might just think that showing the legs would look silly in the same way ragnaros somewhat did. If you can link a legit source that states he has no body, that would be great ofcourse.<br />
<br />
2) I don't think anyone, or atleast the sensible lore fans didn't expect or want to fight Sargeras. But there has been no build up to this moment, no hints that Sargeras is there. Not to mention that we get a complete retcon to come to this deus ex machina conclusion. It just feels weak, rubbish and devoid of good storytelling. The entire cinematic is just for people that don't care about the lore and like shiny and &quot;epic&quot; things. The whole rainbow and titans being there is literally a Deus ex machina, which is some seriously shit writing.<br />
<br />
3) Maybe, but he might have made it more sensible, but we don't know and really, it doesn't matter. In the end it's a very unsatisfying end to Sargeras.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I love the lore, but Blizzard doesn't respect their lore fans at all. The only reason they still bother writing stuff is to build hype. It doesn't have to make sense for them, it just needs to look cool. The lore is a shortsighted mess.</div></div><hr />

The silver surfer is being killed left and right (Invasion bosses), with the main one biting it in the previous patch.<br />

It wasn't just 4; all of the titans funneled Argus's power into him, to give him a body and thus bind him to the seat of the pantheon, with no way to escape.

<br />
I agree, this is kind of...lame. Sarg has been built up for so long, as a mystery figure who cuts planets in half, the god who went feral...and this? He gets &quot;Nooooooo!&quot; as his legacy? (Serious, he looked like he was going to have &quot;relations&quot; with the planet, with the way they staged that.) This guy was going to need an Army Of Light to defeat...and he gets a fucking skybeam? ANOTHER FUCKING SKYBEAM. And yet again, the players get no sense of threat from him, he's offstage until the end, just like Arthas, just like Deathwing. <br />
<br />
There's no reverence. No honor. No respect. Metzen would never have allowed Sarg to be Ion's bitch, like this. This is a means to an end, not a story that's crafted with love and passion and respect. Sarg is just another raid boss now. Don't take characters or lore too seriously anymore, because the devs sure as hell aren't. The WoW devs no longer make games made by gamers that care. They just don't give a fuck anymore, and it's showing. Lets just sweep Sarg off the stage, we're bored with him, and go back to FOR THE HORDE HURR DURR. Because the planet only has a giant fucking sword sticking out of it, which would change the tides and trigger massive earthquakes and tsunamies and possibly change the orbit of the planet, no, it makes total sense to ignore that and focus on the sandbox slapfights of the cardboard standup characters you'e devolved anyone interesting into. Yeah. That totally works. <br />
<br />
Fucking devs. Just when I think they can't sink lower, they go and do it. Fucking Mario Brothers has more respect for their lore than these dullards do. I'm officially done giving a fuck about WoW lore. I just don't care anymore. It's shit storytelling, and it's only getting worse - and now you fools will have to deal with that hack Christy Golden's shitting all over lore, too. And more skybeams. Many more skybeams - because you can't kill a raid boss or do anything in WoW without a fucking skybeam, ammirite? <br />
<br />
They should fire Afrasiabii and Ion and the rest and hire the crew who did the lore books, they seem to still give a shit.<br />
<br />
I agree with you 100%. I can't believe it ended like this.</div></div><hr />

Probably, but I've been so run off my feet game-wise collecting Legion stuff I haven't really had the motivation to just go explore the old world to see Argus in old zones, and I had really hoped to level a new alt or to with it in the sky, and with the DMF night potion active.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we'll get a toy to put it back, but I don't expect that until Legion Timewalking, and I'll need another new Allied Race or two by that time, as I reckon I'll have finished the known six before the post-BfA expansion launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have suspended every ounce of disbelief starting more-or-less with WoD, which was an absolute travesty of 'storytelling,' but Legion really does take the cake. They've done ridiculous things with little/no explanation that goes far beyond &quot;lol fantasy physics doesn't matter&quot;.<br />
<br />
Like, the tenth/tip of that sword would be equivalent to an apocalypse-meteor on Earth. Azeroth should be completely done.<br />
<br />
And that's not even to mention just how anti-climactic the raids have become. We can't just beat bosses outright--the powercreep is absurd, there's always got to be god-like characters stepping in and saving us/killstealing last minute.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh. And then there's the whole Illidan thing...so he's going toe-to-toe with Sargeras now? C'mon. The hell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, the scale of Sargeras/the sword/etc changes wildly from cut to cut. He's got his hand on STV/BB from the looks, so that should be crushed...then the sword is massive in space (and somehow burning?) and then ramming into the planet. A fragment of that sword--like, a tenth--would be enough to wipe out all life on earth, turning the surface into magma/fire/etc., obliterating the sky with dust/debris for centuries.<br />
<br />
This goes way, way beyond suspension of disbelief. This is somebody saying; &quot;HURR DURR HE STABS PLANET SO COOL&quot;</div></div><hr />

So...what was he doing then if Illidan finally opened the way to Azeroth? That was his main goal for millennia, right? So once he gets that, he just chills in a dust cloud and lets a tiny little crystal ship ruin his plans - for months?</div></div><hr />

what can you expect from a blizzard cinematic these days besides a short collection of cool-looking but empty tropes<br />
<br />
he had time to aim he should have gone for orgrimmar. at least then his whole demon invasion would have accomplished something.<br />
<br />
I kind of feel that they chose Silithus because it's the most expendable zone, but at the same time maybe there was a reason... If Sargeras is trying to rid Azeroth of void, maybe Silithus was a good place to aim for because of the previous presence of C'Thun</div></div><hr />

he has eyes my dude you can see them in the cutscene. he could use them to see and process that visual information to pick a good place to stab his gigantic million foot long sword<br />
<br />
He wasn't aiming for a city to do damage to, he was aiming for Azeroth, and he kind of fucked us on this one. It's literally Azeroth's 'third death', so to speak. The damage that he did has lasting impact, some of which is Azerite.</div></div><hr />

D'oh, of course not! But I think it would've been better if Sargeras managed to pull off something so that, at least for a moment, you'd think it wouldn't work. But of course, adding some extra spice to it, they finally pull it off.<br />

Illidan is the eternal guard, not jailer, the titans are the jailers, as without their power, Sargeras would never be jailed in the first place.<br />
<br />
So it's likely Sargeras is under a timelock spell by Aman'thul, and not to mention titans are immune to nearly all forms of magic, damage &amp; weapons other than the school they are weak against (fel being one of them) however Sargeras being fel/fire infused, pretty much means that whatever Illidan does, it will not have a lasting effect on Sargeras.<br />
<br />
And we all know what happens the day the power of the titan is depleted, and Sargeras is loose again, Illidan will be the first fatality.<br />

He wasn't aiming for a city to do damage to, he was aiming for Azeroth, and he kind of fucked us on this one. It's literally Azeroth's 'third death', so to speak. The damage that he did has lasting impact, some of which is Azerite.<br />
<br />
Titans in theory can't die, their essence is eternal, so I suppose not even Argus is dead, unless the consumption of his power meant the complete destruction of his essence. Azeroth will repair over time, as their essence is in a constant regenerative state, and if needed she can draw spirit power from all Azerothians to repair, and I think when we use our artifact weapons to destroy the weapon, it will lead to Azeroth repairing herself.</div></div><hr />

I dont know if we have clear info,but from my impresion he had lost his body when he used the avatar to come in azeroth and enter the guardian,in the cinematic what i can tell is that the smoke is sargeras not that he is hidding in it,and the patheon uses the power from argus to rebuild him so he can be sealed,sargeras wasnt planing on destroying azeroth rather control it like he did with argus,but when he saw what was happening his only option left was to destroy it.</div></div><hr />
