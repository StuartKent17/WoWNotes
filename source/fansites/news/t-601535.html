You'll also notice that the blades of azzinoth are on the Actiontrip comic thumbnails ... Well, that's a pretty good timing, because Method (http://smiler.se/method/portal/) dropped the [item=32837] on their first Illidan kill. It's not the first drop but it seems that the droprate isn't that bad. (Only 13 guilds killed Illidan for the moment)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but some of these guilds (i.e. Nihilum, LR or DnT) killed Illidan four or five times so far, which makes the droprate a bit lower 8)</div></div><hr />

it should be legendaries<br />
Then again to make a legendary weapon in the old days<br />
TF need some elementium and arcane bars if I remember correct<br />
Same the hand of ragnaros<br />
Atiesh needs 40 pieces from each boss<br />
We still wait for the Ashbringer<br />
And now the rogues they just get the drop...and looks like many of the warblades have droped am I correct?</div></div><hr />
