Icecrown 5-man Instances<br />

<br />
Please note that all characters cannot enter it for the moment because of phasing problems, this bug will be fixed in the next build. You can only test the Pit of Saron for the moment (the 2nd wing of the 5-man dungeons) because of a bug with the Forge of Souls (1st wing).<br />
<br />
Trash mobs and bosses do not drop any item for the moment, you'll have to wait a few more days for that apparently. I'll just leave you with a few extra screenshots of the Pit of Saron. (On test realms this time) <br />

<br />
Spell Coefficient Penalty<br />
<br />
Tealeaf, here is the formula for coefficient penalty for all spells that has been in effect for all of LK:<br />
<br />
If caster level is less than max caster level, then the penalty = 1.0.<br />
If caster level is at or greater than max caster level, then the penalty = (22 + max level - caster level) / 20.<br />
The penalty is capped at 0. Max caster level per spell is also pretty inconsistent, but it's around 4 levels higher than the level at which you get the spell.<br />
<br />
Basically, once the caster is 3 levels higher than the max cast level of the spell, the standard coefficient of the spell is multiplied by that penalty (losing 5% of the coefficient per level), with the coefficient reaching zero when the player is 22 levels higher than the max cast level.<br />
<br />
For Rejuv, this makes the following table of coefficients for a level 80 player:<br />
<br />
Rank 15: 0.376<br />
Rank 14: 0.376<br />
Rank 13: 0.376*0.75=0.282<br />
Rank 12: 0.376*0.5=0.188<br />
Rank 11: 0.376*0.35=0.1316<br />
Rank 10: 0.376*0.25=0.094<br />
Rank 9: 0.376*0=0<br />
Rank 8 and lower: 0<br />
<br />
As I said, the penalty is kind of an anachronism since the ranks all cost the same amount of mana now, but I can understand why you all might have expected rank 15 to jump in coefficient. <br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding Abyssal Shatter<br />
A new enchanting recipe was recently hotfixed to become available. This recipe is available through enchanting trainers. The reason why you may not currently be seeing this recipe is that it requires the server to be restarted to become active. We expect this to be live on all US realms no later than next Tuesday, October 6, as that is when the next scheduled maintenance is set to occur. <br />

Pit of Saron Feedback<br />
Thanks for the feedback so far. We'll get he phasing related issues sorted out for the next push. As some of noted there are sounds, VO, music, and even some creature models that are not final.<br />
<br />
Also note from a story perspective that this is the 2nd of the 3 dungeons. We had to disable the Forge of Souls for this initial PTR push due to a last minute crash bug discovered in the zone, and it begins the quest and story for the three Icecrown dungeons. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/20140809423-pit-of-saron--feedback-oct-01.html))<br />

Spell Ranks removal in Cataclysm<br />
Essentially there will be no ranks. Instead your spell will just grow every time you gain a level. The biggest difference you will notice is not having to train say rank 16 of Rejuv. Your spellbook would just say &quot;Rejuvenation.&quot; <br />
<br />
[...] Base points can still increase. In fact they will increase every level instead of in big chunks.<br />
<br />
Assume for the moment you get Rejuv at level 1 instead of level 4. Then imagine there are 85 ranks of Rejuv and you get a new rank automatically whenever you ding without visiting your trainer. It isn't a huge change conceptually, except that your level 79 Rejuvs would be buffed relative to what they are now. Mostly if just gets players to focus less on rank and more on player level (and then ultimately talents, glyphs and gear). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20133929146-33-ptr-rejuv-change.html))<br />
<br />
Spell avoidance for all pets<br />
The change should apply to all pets. I think that includes every class but warrior, paladin and rogue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20126978977-no-avoidance-for-spirit-wolves.html))<br />

Glyph of Icy Touch Nerf in 3.3<br />
As several players pointed out, the old glyph was driving too many other decisions with regard to spec and abilities used. We want DKs to be a melee class with some ranged abilities, not a ranged class. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20122258371-more-dk-nerfs-just-curious-as-to-the-reason.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Rejuvenation &quot;nerf&quot; in 3.3<br />
We don't want rank 15 to have that extra tick. It is technically a bug in that we didn't intend for it to have that behavior, but obviously we sat on the change for awhile. However since the popular Resto style has now become Rejuv on as many people as possible, we thought the extra tick had become problematic. Frankly we think druids can absorb the small nerf without hurting their overall healing much.<br />
<br />
We're not trying to hide a nerf, and we can certainly change the patch note to not say bug fix if that makes it go down any easier.<br />
<br />
We'll look into any discrepancy in numbers between rank 14 and 15 and make sure things are working as intended. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20133929146-33-ptr-rejuv-change.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter <br />
Avoidance and Fluffy's lack of intelligence<br />
It is likely we will just replace the hunter pet Avoidance talent with one that increases pet dps. It is too situational to have as a talent now. Hunter pets will just take 90% less damage from creature AE the same as other pets do (meaning &quot;for free&quot;). We offer that avoidance as recognition that Fluffy doesn't have the AI to get out of the fire on boss fights and likes to go in straight lines between you and a target, even if that means crossing fire.<br />
<br />
Ninety percent avoidance should be enough to survive almost all boss AE attacks for a second or two -- enough to get a heal or move your wolf (or sporebat). It isn't intended to let your pet just ignore AE completely and stand in void zones. If you're a pet class, you are going to have to manage the pet a little in dungeons and raids.<br />
<br />
It was never our intent that pets just shrug off AE in PvP situations. In fact, it's a little goofy if you think about it. We just technically couldn't distinguish between creature and player AE before. We only go to that distinction as a last resort, since we like for PvP and PvE to work similarly. However we thought it was necessary in this case, since the complexity of boss encounters just doesn't always leave pets with a way to avoid the AE damage. We think PvP AE damage often is avoidable (dude isn't literally Bladestorming the entire arena at once), but we still understand that this is a PvP nerf to pets and we may buff them in other ways to compensate.

Seal of Corruption in 3.3<br />
Seal of Corruption's tooltip incorrectly stated that it did higher damage than it actually did. It actually did (and still does) the same damage as Seal of Vengeance. Vengeance's tooltip did not have the error. We changed Corruption's tooltip to be correct.<br />
<br />
Actual damage did not change. You were not nerfed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20126978907-seal-of-corruption-nerfs.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
Vanish in 3.3<br />
We need to make Vanish work as advertised. As I've said, if this results in a massive net buff for rogues, we will compensate in other ways. However, the intent isn't that it's another version of Cloak. We just want to compensate for server lag, missile travel time and the like. It's entirely possible 1 sec is too generous to accomplish the job and a smaller number will work. That's the kind of thing we will be evaluating through the PTR process.<br />
<br />
Unless my understanding of the spell is completely wrong, Flare actually removes stealth, so it should work in any case. I will verify this part tomorrow. <br />
<br />
[...] Dear rogues, it's really pretty irrelevant if something is a bug fix or a buff. Both can increase power. We aren't going to let a class be overpowered because &quot;Well, we had to fix the bug, so our hands are tied.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dear everyone else, we're not going to let a broken ability stay broken just because the class is doing well. That's not good design. As I said, we may have to make adjustments in other ways.(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20136599376-vanish-buff-unacceptable.html))<br />

Curse of Elements (Rank 4) (Yes, blame it on me, I'll just argue that you didn't check the spell rank)<br />
Datamined info is datamined. Curse of the Elements rank 5 is still 13%. It's possible the reference refers to rank 4 going from 10% to 11% (since rank 3 was also 10%). OMG lock buff! <br />
<br />
[...] Curse of Elements rank 5 has not changed between 3.2.2 and 3.3. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20131899339-why-the-nerf-to-coe.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno about the Pit of Saron being in a bad shape, I ran though last night and it worked just fine, bar the odd bug or two. There's a few things that needs tuning, but isn't the whole point of PTR figuring that out? If the rest of the instances are anything like the Pit, I say 3.3 is going to be excellent :D<br />

How is fixing a broken class mechanic a buff ? Rogues aren't getting addtional abilites/stats. <br />
If a pallybubble was broken and allowing one type of damage to get through, and Blizz fixed it, is that a buff ? If a mages Iceblock was messed up and allowing physical damage to break it early, and blizzard fixed it, would that be a buff ? people need to stop QQ-ing about rogues being over powered and learn how to fight them, or give up on PVP because they just suck at it .</div></div><hr />

Perhaps they thought its just as fast (probably faster) to go straight to public testing, instead of piling everything up first on their internal server first and then moving it out there.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to the PTRs, where sometimes you'll get 1 new boss to test, if that, and massive lag and server crashes are a constant annoyance.<br />
<br />
Seriously, there's going to be a LOT of stuff to test this time around, there's 3 x 5-man dungeons, their heroic counterparts, and a raid instance, with tons of bosses, both 10 and 25-man, and hard modes.<br />
<br />
This time, PTR testing is going to go on for a LONG time. It just so happens that there's 2 5-man's up first. Don't expect them to suddenly switch on every single boss in the ICC raid and let you farm it for weeks on end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly my point. We have 3 instances, a rather large raid which will need a lot of focus testing, probably many class changes not yet included, several items and models to be checked. If they start at such a slow pace this will take a lot longer than the average 8 weeks each patch spends on PTR. Usually a lot more of the content that was to be tested was up for testing when the PTRs went up. I am not complaining, it is a PTR after all. Just find it weird and divergent from their previous policy with PTR content. Also some of the bugs I've seen in Pit are beyond the basic bugs playtesting helps remove. The terrain bugs and the issue with AoE rendering for instance looks like a pretty big thing to have slipped though internal testing (not to mention the phasing bug).</div></div><hr />

Maybe they could make a spell where a druid traps someone in a nature trap, maybe entangle them in roots or somthing like that. They could even make a talent that instantly casts that spell on anyone who hits the druid. Then they could make a spell to take someone out of combat for a short time, maybe catch them in a cyclone or something like that. If a druid could also go bear form and do a short stun on the person that would be great, imagine if just shapeshifting also removed any snares so you could then use that short stun to get out of melee range. Finally some sort of knockback affect that druids could use to push melee away from them would also be great.<br />
<br />
Of course, since blizz hate druids they will never implement any of the above, after all god forbid druids actually had some sort of escape mechanism to prevent them from being killed. At the very least they could give the druid the ability to cast some heals when not in boomkin form, at least that might save them every now and then. Or maybe even some sort of barkskin to reduce damage taken in melee. <br />
<br />
But you are right, blizz just hate druids and will never give them any sort of defensive abilities whatsoever. I mean, when you consider that warriors, rogues and DKs can all use an ability to get back into melee range every 15 seconds or so it is just riduculous thad druids only have four or five ways to get out of melee range, all on shorter cooldowns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So this is my last killmovie. It features all three bosses on heroic mode. Sry but only the 3rd is after last night buff(fix), which means:<br />
<br />
1. On 1st boss we didn't get barrels, behind which we can go out of LoS and clear the debuff(so I had to dispell it and/or outheal it). It seems that after the fix this debuff hits for a lot more and it is advised for all except the tank and melees to go out of LoS for few seconds to clear it(reset the stacks).<br />
<br />
2. On 2nd boss we only had the &quot;Toxin Waste(&quot;poison&quot; bolt on random member, which leaves poison cloud in the place where it lands) - easy to escape if you watch the animation. We also had the skill &quot;Unleash Poison Cloud&quot;, which is simply short AoE poison nova for melees to run away from, ahh ye it also puts a debuff on the tank, which needs to be cleansed. We didn't have the &quot;purple bombs(circles on the spot where you are standing with lightening like animation coming out of the boss)&quot; from which ALL need to move. Also we didn't have the Flame Leviathan like aggro targets(the boss chooses one target and slowly follows it, I don't know what happens if it reaches it). It was uber fun on heroic after the fix, cause almost anything in this fight can kill you really fast if you are braindead and love to stay in random sh*ts on the ground :D<br />
<br />
3. The 3rd boss movie is made with different group AFTER the fix(buff). Its a lot more fun now, ppl take more dmg etc. First you need to watch for the debuff called &quot;Overlord's Brand&quot; - pretty hard to miss it, cause a color class(DPS or Heal) based lightening like effect is coming out from boss to you :) If you DPS with this debuff all of your damage goes to the tank, if you heal with this debuff all your heals goes to the boss. Also Rimefang(the frostwyrm) cast an Ice attack on random party member, which if hits it target puts it in &quot;ice cube&quot; for few seconds and deals a good amount of damage(yep I failed once on it, you don't need to point out how much I s*ck :D). Also don't stay in the ice patches on the ground.</div></div><hr />

Priests are fine... you even got an ability that can absorb millions of damage from a single hit, while at the same time healing 40% of the target's health. Yeah... unloved for sure. <br />
<br />
Well I am sure I don't have to point out how Paladins have that as well, they don't need to cast it, unglyphed it has the same cooldown and it is up constantly not for 10 seconds. If having Guardian Spirit justifies being at the bottom of the healing meters and having situational burst healing that still gets out performed by rapid fire Chain Heal spam then I am suprized Paladins can keep aggro on Hogger if we are judging each classes capacity by this one skill. But wait they are at the forefront of their role? I am pretty sure no one in the Blizzard development team actually plays a Priest.<br />
<br />
OH YER, did I forget to add that it bugs 30% of the time when there is server lag or client lag between when it is applied and when the next hit is. GS on the target .5 of a second before the 60k hit but oh wait he is still dead. And it doesn't absorb. So it doesn't even contribute to absorb effects on WoW Meters Online. And if it did absorb, would it not be a Disc skill? Jog on mate.<br />
<br />
Wait are you a butt hurt druid?</div></div><hr />

He said HOLY PRIESTS, not discipline l2read.<br />
<br />
Also switching to disc requires new gear. Also its a different playstyle, I prefer holy healing but at this moment its not as fun, nor rewarding as before all the nerfs lately.<br />
<br />
Also, WTB all my GOLD BACK on ALL MY TOONS for spending money learning spell ranks, if you take that shit away you're going to have some annoyed people.</div></div><hr />

We want DKs to be a melee class with some ranged abilities, not a ranged class.<br />

This has got to be the dumbest damn thing I've heard Ghostcrawler say in a long time. <br />
<br />
Oh wait, I get it, this whole IT Glyph nerf is because of pvp. <br />
Just like most DK nerfs these days. This blows.</div></div><hr />

i don't know about you bro but when i level i check &lt;insert wow information site of your preference&gt; to see what if any new skills or rank ups i will be getting<br />
it acts as a motivator bro, if my primary damage ability is getting a new rank the next time i level, all the more reason to bro, of course this creates dead zones like the mid 50's, but such is life bro<br />
<br />
NOT AWESOME bro, and honestly, whats a few hundred gold, you make A Lot more just leveling that toon bro, the only thing i generally need to get money from other toons for is epic flight.<br />
<br />

You can pull off an easy 2K DPS if geared for it with ranged only. It's a nice WTF? when you are OT on Kel'thuzad and since there are 4 melee, you just sit off to the side and spam icy touch, bb, death and you have the runic/runes to keep it going non-stop until the adds come out. Shocked I was, tickled I am.</div></div><hr />
