If you want early access to this year’s sale, just order a BlizzCon 2018 Virtual Ticket (https://www.battle.net/shop/product/blizzcon-virtual-ticket). Once you purchase your Virtual Ticket, your Blizzard account will automatically be flagged to purchase BlizzCon items from the Blizzard Gear Store beginning with the early access period on October 11.<br />
<br />
If you’re attending the show in person, you should have already received a code to redeem this year’s digital bonuses—including a Virtual Ticket, which grants on Blizzard account early access to the BlizzCon merch sale. These codes were emailed directly to ticket buyers, so if a friend purchased a ticket for you, check with them for your code.<br />
<br />
If you’re in Europe or the Americas, your order will ship out from the Europe or North America Gear Stores respectively. Not all countries may be eligible to participate, and international shipping rates and other fees may apply.

I would assume that is intentional and not &quot;boy, they sure let the detail slip.&quot; I can see the appeal of a hyper realistic statue but i really enjoyed the stylized Star Wars statues. I could definitely see picking up some of these if they did Jaina, Velen, Guldan maybe. <br />

It's the half leek, half octopus fella Pachimari's best friend Yachimon who is &quot;a sausage man made up of ground Pachimaris&quot; and &quot;is a born again vegetarian because he feels bad about being made up of Pachimaris and that's why he carries his favourite food, the leek&quot;.<br />
<br />
All according to the OW designer David Kang.<br />
<br />
Personally I love his rather phallic appearance and it's the only Overwatch spray I ever use.<br />

That might be the new Snausages Diablo class, which they are going to reveal at the Blizzcon opening. <br />
<br />
He also carries a new type of legendary weapon: the fluffy dildo of the green plains.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cuafpr</div><div class="date">2018-10-05, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) this is a preview NOT everything. <br />
<br />
2) there likely will be a bigger statue, i suspect this line might be much smaller and more affordable to the masses vs 300/400 USD for one. <br />
<br />
3) revealing the big state charecter could give away a lot, after all if there is a big Diablo announcement its possible its a diablo game based statue, i know they sculpted a Tyreal statue in house a few years back but didn't take it to production</div></div><hr />

Was saying that to my other half. I'm a nerd but jesus... there's being a nerd then there's diving in and swimming in the 'mock me and kick my ass' sea. Some of this veers dangerously close.<br />

I called it before BfA was released and some horde nutcases said I was insane for saying so.<br />
<br />
Faction wars will end with BfA.<br />
<br />
Saurfang will be Warchief with Anduin's blessing. Together, they declare a truce to fight against old gods.<br />
