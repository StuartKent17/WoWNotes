This patch finally added and unlocked the Tillers questline. First up, we have the introductory quests that demonstrate a few basic farming tasks, and tell you about Farmer Yoon's background. He is new to farming and wants to prove himself, so he needs your help!<br />

<br />
Planting Seeds<br />
Now let's take a look at a few outcomes of planting seeds. After you get your plants to a growing state, you have to come back after the daily quest reset to gather your crop. If the mechanic for fixing a problem with your plant isn't obvious, you can check with Yoon and he will give you some instructions (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/july/yoonSolutions.jpg).<br />

<br />
Your First Vote<br />
As fun as watching questing is, let's take a quicker look at what happens after your first crops grow and you earn a vote!<br />
Gina Mudclaw says: Come walk with me, Chaud. I would like to pay Farmer Yoon a visit.<br />
Gina Mudclaw says: You know, you sure saved my hide with those scallions.<br />
Gina Mudclaw says: Cooks are always looking for fresh vegetables. Anything you grow on your farm, you can use for cooking or sell to other cooks.<br />
Gina Mudclaw says: Talk to any of the Ironpaws at the market if you want to improve your own cooking skill.<br />
Gina Mudclaw says: Hey Farmer Yoon!<br />
Farmer Yoon says: Hey Gina! Didn't expect a visit from you.<br />
Gina Mudclaw says: Listen, since you two did such a good turn by helping me out, I'm casting the first vote to help you join the Tillers.<br />
Gina Mudclaw says: There are four other votes you'll need to get, but that'll come in time.<br />
Gina Mudclaw says: Settle yourselves in and come by the market any day if you are looking for work.<br />
Gina Mudclaw says: Welcome to The Heartland!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Further Votes<br />
After you have earned your first vote, you can check your relationship status with all of the Tillers at the Tiller's Shrine (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/july/tillerShrine.jpg). Gina will tell you (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/july/ginaGifts.jpg) more about gifts that you can give to the other members to increase your Friendship level as well as where they are located. These gifts are BoP items that are found in (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/july/tillerGift.jpg) piles of soil around the world.<br />

Continued Expansion <br />
After your first success at growing something, Farmer Yoon isn't satisfied with his four small clumps of dirt, and has you ask Gai Lan for some help clearing out the weeds (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/july/ClearWeeds.jpg). There are a few more Growing the Farm quests that come after that, likely opening some more dirt plots for you to plant in.<br />

Further Friendship <br />
Each of the NPCs that you can become friends with have some quests that do not reward Tiller's rep, but will help you to become better friends faster. You can find the list of these quests on WoWDB. Upon becoming better friends with the NPCs, they will mail (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/july/farmerMail.jpg) you drinks, seeds, and a few items like the Straw Hat (http://www.wowdb.com/items/90042) and Red Cricket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/85222)!<br />

Beta Class Balance Analysis<br />
Is it intended that secondary stats now have twice the itemization budget of primary stats in terms of gems<br />
Yes. With the possible exception of Spirit, there is little decision in choosing red gems in the live game. Secondary stats are often more interesting in general because there are break points, hard caps, and personal preferences. Any Agi user who eschews Agi is doing it wrong. <br />
<br />
Let me throw some numbers at you<br />
Sadly those aren't the kind of numbers that support compelling arguments. Classes can be overpowered with only a few abilities or have dozens and still be underpowered. If there are situations where you feel helpless, let us know. If you disagree with a design direction, let us know that too (though this thread is not the right one for that).<br />
<br />
We understand not every player has the ability and/or inclination to come up with numbers such as healing per second or the effectiveness of cooldowns. But this one thread is for those who can. It has been enormously beneficial in helping us catch bugs or design problems as well as helping players calibrate their sims and spreadsheets. Please help us keep the signal to noise ratio strong. <br />
<br />
This point is directed the blues (and no one else)<br />
Sorry, these are public forums. We like and encourage players to talk to each other. The echo chamber effect is strong in our forums, so we think it's actually very healthy when players can disagree with you, provided they can do so in a constructive manner. If someone's just trolling you, ignore them and we'll take care of it. But someone disagreeing with you is not the same as trolling.<br />

To provide an update on tanking mechanics, I want to comment on Mastery for Guardians and Brewmasters. This is somewhat of an over-generalization, but tanks typically care about 4 things when gearing in decreasing order of importance:<br />
<br />
Survive the maximum burst damage of the encounter (aka Effective Health)<br />
Minimize healing needed (aka Damage Reduction + Self Healing)<br />
Hold aggro on whatever you’re needed to hold aggro on (aka TPS)<br />
Maximize damage dealt (aka DPS)<br />
<br />
#4 is generally much less important than #1-3, and overlaps with #3 heavily when considering gear. And #3 is relatively easy these days anyway. So, usually it just comes down to #1 and #2.<br />
<br />
Stamina primarily helps with #1. Dodge primarily helps with #2. Most other stats help with resource generation, which typically translate into #2. Mastery for Guardians and Brewmasters is in the somewhat unusual place of helping with both #1 and #2 significantly.<br />
<br />
If you compare Mastery to Dodge for a Brewmaster, as a few theorycrafters here have done, you can see that, purely in terms of how much they reduce your damage taken, Dodge wins by a considerable margin. We balanced it that way, because we give value to how much it helps with #1 as well. Obviously, helping with #1 has some value, because you care about Stamina. We see Mastery for Guardians and Brewmasters as sort of a hybrid between Stamina and Avoidance, in terms of how it helps improve your character.<br />
<br />
It’s easy to objectively compare the value of two stats in terms of how much they help with #1, or how much they help with #2. But comparing some amount of help with #1 to some amount of help with #2 is much more complex and subjective. It’s an interesting choice that tanks have to make all the time, and one of the most successful choices in gearing that the game provides (Stamina vs. Avoidance being the primary way that choice is expressed). So, that means balancing a stat that provides a mix of both can be complex and subjective as well. After much deliberation, we’re going to try valuing the effective health benefits of Mastery for Brewmasters and Guardians significantly lower than the damage reduction benefits, and adjusting the Mastery conversion rates to reflect that.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this provides a bit of background and perspective about the complexities underlying even the simplest of changes: In the next build, you’ll find Mastery for Guardians providing 1.25% Armor per Mastery (up from 0.65%), and for Brewmasters providing 0.5% Stagger per Mastery (up from 0.3%).<br />

While doing hunter ability testing I noticed that Wild Quiver looks to be doing only about half the damage of an autoshot (possibly a bit less). Historically Wild Quiver has been roughly the same damage as autoshot. Was this changed deliberately or is it a bug?<br />
Yes, Wild Quiver does 50% weapon damage now, but we’ve increased the proc rate substantially to compensate. Also, the next build you get should include a significant number of changes to hunter ability damage, so it’s probably best to wait until then for really detailed investigation of their damage formulae. Super brief and incomplete summary of changes include nearly doubling Wild Quiver’s proc chance; doubling the damage of the level 90 talents; buffing BM’s Mastery considerably; Master Marksman reduced to 3 stacks; doubling the damage of Black Arrow and Serpent Sting for Survival; significantly nerfing Beast Cleave; nearly halving the cost of Explosive Shot; buffing Aimed, Arcane, and Chimera Shot noticeably; nerfing Cobra shot noticeably; nearly doubling the damage of Kill Command; reducing the cost of Arcane Shot; nerfing Focus Fire and Frenzy somewhat… There have been a lot of changes to Hunter damage.<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman))<br />
My question is, how is this talent intended to work? How much is the heal supposed to be? 25% of base maximum (which would be 20% of new maximum)? 25% of new maximum? Are health percentages supposed to remain constant through its effect? Where does this 15% come from?<br />
We weren't able to reproduce the results you mention, but this is the intended functionality of Nature's Guardian: When it is triggered, 25% of your current maximum health is calculated. Your current and maximum health is then increased by this value. When it wears off, it reduces your current and max health by that value. It should never actually kill you, but it can reduce your current health to 1.<br />
<br />
Is it intended for Healing Stream and Healing Tide to not benefit from mastery on the first ticks or is it just a technical limitation from totems? If so does this mean that crit does not benefit on first tick either for HTT(Have yet to see it but didn't do extensive testing on it).<br />
Fixed for next build. It also dynamically adjusts with your mastery instead of snapshotting it.<br />

Speaking of ICDs and Enhancement, could you clarify how Windfury is working for MoP?<br />

Historically, Windfury has had a 3 second ICD between procs with a shared lockout between hands. It would also proc from white hits along with Stormstrike and Lava Lash. So my questions are this:<br />
<br />
1) Is the 3 second ICD still the plan for MoP. I just did some initial testing against a training dummy, and that still seems to be the case.<br />
2) Is the ICD still supposed to be shared between both hands for MoP?<br />
3) Is this ICD a fixed 3 second ICD for MoP, or is it effected by Haste at all?<br />
4) Is Windfury supposed to proc from Stormstrike and Lava Lash? From my testing, I didn't see a single proc when just isolating Stormstrike and Lava Lash attacks. On Live, I'm seeing both yellow attacks proc Windfury. I'm assuming this is just a bug, but I want to confirm if this is by design for MoP<br />
Windfury should be mostly the same as on live. 1) Yes. 2) Yes. 3) Fixed. 4) White attacks and Wind Lash only. Other than adding Wind Lash to being able to proc it, it doesn’t look like it’s changed in quite a while; are you sure that yellow attacks trigger it on live? (Easy way to test just yellow attacks: Turn 90degrees away from a target dummy. White attacks won’t hit, but yellow attacks can, at exactly 90degrees).<br />
<br />
- Do you meet #1?<br />
- If yes, then any further value in this category is 0.<br />
- If no, then get more stuff that increases your #1 value (primarily Stamina).<br />
It’s not that simple though. Meeting #1 is somewhat binary, like you describe, somewhat not. If you beat an encounter without dying, obviously you had enough effective health. But more effective health would still be useful; it’s definitely not without value. Healers can use slower, more efficient heals on you if you have more of a health cushion. You can tank more mobs at a time. You also may have gotten lucky with avoidance, and never took a special attack and an undodged auto attack at the same time, or perhaps never got 5 undodged hits in a row. Every pull is different. There are definitely diminishing returns on the value of more effective health, but it doesn’t instantly diminish to 0 at some magical ‘enough’ point.<br />

I was looking at the warlock changes in the upcoming beta build and noticed a few things. Why are you nerfing affliction so much? I agree it needed a nerf, but so much that it will go below the other 2 specs by a large amount? <br />
<br />
Not to mention destroying a glyph and adding a new ability that kills clipping. People will just ignore the glyph and Pandemic and just refresh dots right after they fall off to do max dps. Clipping with or without the glyph is useless now, but with the glyph it's like nerfing yourself. Drain Soul is barley better than MG under 20% today, now with it getting a HUGE nerf it will be completely useless as an execute.<br />
We encourage you to try out the changes and see what has changed rather than relying on information that has been datamined. To help further explain, we’ll briefly summarize what has changed with Affliction damage. <br />
<br />
We noticed (thanks to the community interaction in this thread) that the Everlasting Affliction glyph was providing a huge DPS increase, but as we’ve said, we don’t want huge DPS increases to come from glyphs. Instead of simply nerfing the glyph, we baked the benefits that the glyph provided into the entire class via Pandemic, a level 90 passive ability, and changed the glyph to something completely different. We also changed the design of Malefic Grasp to, hopefully, make the ability more reliable and simple; our intention was not to nerf it. It’s important to note that we reduced the base period of Unstable Affliction and Corruption from 3 seconds to 2 seconds, so both Malefic Grasp and Drain Soul should give you the same additional DoT damage now as they did before.<br />
<br />
One other clarification about the warlock changes: Drain Soul still deals double damage under 20%. It being missing from the new tooltip is just a tooltip error and has been corrected for the next build.<br />
<br />
Now onto what some others have brought up. Does the MG/DS under 20% effect count as the dots themselves ticking? Considering how that would nerf shard regen if not, I personally believe it does. Since I can't test it yet, some clarification would be wonderful.<br />
Yes. In all ways, the additional ticks of the DoTs provided by MG/DS should function as additional ticks of the respective DoTs. For example, the extra Corruption ticks that occur (for 50% damage) from MG are able to proc Nightfall. This means that you’re actually getting *more* Corruption ticks than before, so we reduced the proc chance per tick of Nightfall to compensate; you should get the same number of Nightfall procs per time as before. <br />
<br />
The Malefic Grasp mechanic change should not be a nerf at all. However, the 25% nerf to most Affliction-specific abilities should amount to a ~20% (very ballpark number, don’t hold us to that number if you model it as 21.8% or something) nerf. This is indeed a rather extreme amount, because they really were that extremely overpowered. We had been balancing them previously based on not having that glyph (and so when I said that we were seeing Affliction only a little ahead of Destruction, that was based on Affliction not having that glyph).<br />
<br />
My personal testing on target dummies and every sim i've seen is now hoping Affliction at the bottom of the warlock heap<br />
Any sources for this so we have something to actually go on? As we said above, Affliction damage was too high. Not every damage adjustment needs to be greeted with sky is falling rhetoric or the discussion quickly loses its benefit. <br />

New Level 75 Talent<br />
The perception was that Deadly Brew was essentially a mandatory PvP talent, which runs against our overall goal of creating choices, while at the same time being highly situational in endgame PvE. <br />
<br />
When the new build hits the servers, take a look at the new set bonuses on the Mists PvP sets. We've added new bonuses alongside the existing ones in most cases, and for Rogues, that's where Deadly Brew has gone.<br />
<br />
Oh okay that makes sense, but that still begs the question why remove that from PvE rogues? That entire tier has literally no options for me. The talent it self is extremely situational, however I can see its uses on boss adds that need to be burned. If you don't want to make mandatory talents why is prep still an option? Any word on how sap, blind, and gouge benefit from this talent?<br />
A couple of points here: First off, regarding the functionality of Prey on the Weak, the primary benefit is going to come on Cheap Shot and Kidney Shot. Blind, Sap, and Gouge are included as a minor ancillary benefit -- there may be situations where you use an Incapacitate to pool energy and prepare a burst, and a bit of increased damage on your opening attack (or a teammate's Chaos Bolt...) would be helpful.<br />
<br />
Second, regarding the usefulness of the tier as a whole in PvE, what you really are questioning is its usefulness in raiding. Any of the talents in that row are going to be quite impactful in scenarios, dungeons (and if you scoff at the idea of using any sort of crowd control in dungeons, check out our Challenge Modes), outdoor solo gameplay, etc. So let's be clear about that. But the criticism regarding raiding is a fair one.<br />
<br />
The majority of our raid bosses do not involve enemies that can be stunned or incapacitated, and I'm not going to try to argue to the contrary. And ideally, a talent tier like the Rogue level 75 would be universally appealing, and present compelling choices, to all types of players who do all types of content. Here are three possible approaches to solving that problem:<br />
<br />
<br />
Add a clearly raid-useful talent to the tier in place of Deadly Brew; something that increases your DPS, or gives you more movement or survivability. The problem? Every raiding rogue will take that talent, and ignore the other two. Redesign the whole tier, moving away from a control theme entirely. The problem here is that we'd essentially be abandoning the design space of ever having talents that improve or rely upon crowd control effects. Attempt to incorporate more opportunities for crowd-control effects and short-duration effects like Stuns and Incapacitates to shine in our raid encounters. In general, the most interesting raid encounters are the ones that involve movement, control, coordination, and aren't just a matter of making your DPS number as big as possible. We're not there yet, but I think we'd like to be.<br />

Brewfest in Mists of Pandaria<br />
Brewfest will be updated for Mists of Pandaria. This means that you will have approximately 10 days after the release of Mists of Pandaria to reach level 89 in order to queue for the Brewfest dungeon boss. Luckily though, a lot of the content does not have a level requirement so you will still be able to participate in a lot of the fun even if you are not level 89.<br />
<br />
Will be Brewfest's part before 25 september be for 85; and then change for 90 levels when 25 september hits? We will not rule out the possibility of this changing, but currently the level requirements will remain the same through the entirety of the event. So you will not be able to access Coren Direbrew until Mists of Pandaria has been released.

Pet Battle Blue Posts<br />
Question about early NPC Trainer battles<br />
The first Trainer battle on the horde side is against a trainer who has a level 5 team (Dagara the fierce). Meanwhile on the alliance side, the first trainer battle is against a trainer with level 2 pets (Julia). <br />
This was just a bug. The trainer levels will be mirrored on both sides in the next build. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/230803-question-about-early-npc-traner-battles/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6193849785?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
Need More Level 22 Pets<br />
There are a lot of 23 -24 level pets in cataclysm and Pandaria, and plenty of level 21 pets in Sholazar Basin. The only zones that have level 22 pets seem to be Icecrown and Stormpeaks, but there are very few to battle. Adding more pets to those zones, and/or making Mount Hyjal level 22 would help fill the gap. <br />
We are making adjustments to the leveling flow that you should see in the next build. Should alleviate this problem. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/230802-need-more-level-22-pets/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6146476675?page=1#4))<br />
<br />
UI Improvements<br />
I just started testing pets, but one thing I noticed is that its pretty frustrating not to be able to select a pet to view their stats from the slot they occupy.<br />
We intend to make the entire battle slot clickable to show the pet details. Should see it in a future build. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6201700160?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
PvP Vulnerability<br />
The fact that players are vulnerable to PvP attacks while in a pet battle is intentional. However, a couple features that go along with this are not implemented yet.<br />
<br />
First off, the exact pet you were fighting when you were broke out of pet battle will be respawned. Same quality, stats and skin color. Second, you will get a 3s damage shield that absorbs 50% of incoming damage to help negate the fact that you need time to recover after exiting the pet battle interface. Both of these will be in for the next build.<br />
<br />
We feel its very important to keep the PvP aspect of the game intact and if you choose to play on a PvP server, you will certainly be fighting for those rare spawns. (This rule effects PVE servers as well but only in contested areas.)

Eternal Striders not in Pet Journal<br />

Questions about Pets I already have.<br />
If I have three of the same pets that I bought or traded for before MoP and they are not WILD Pets, would I be able to learn all three in my pet book, just like if I caught three wild pets of the same kind, or is the 3 pets maximum reserved only only for the wild pets?<br />
Yes, you will be able to have 3 of almost every pet. Certain pets are unique since they are attached to a Wow license, granted from an achievement or earned from TCG codes. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6201700152?page=1#4))<br />

Triangles in Front of Names<br />
So when I roll over the paw icons in my minimap, and it shows what the animal/pet/whatever is, occasionally there is one that has a triangle/arrow in front of its name pointing either up or down. <br />

Raid Testing Schedule - July 30-31<br />
After the weekend, we will be testing a number of raid encounters, including 25-player encounters. The testing schedule for remaining Normal modes will be somewhat accelerated, since the encounters are already familiar to many testers and we are just verifying functionality and tuning.<br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Beta Test Realms, regardless of suggested geographical region.<br />
<br />
Monday, July 30th<br />
Blade Lord Ta'yak (Heart of Fear) - 10 Player Heroic<br />
10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
Gara'jal the Spiritbinder (Mogu'shan Vaults) - 10 Player Normal<br />
16:00 PDT (19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Tuesday, July 31st<br />
Stone Guard (Mogu'shan Vaults) - 25 Player Normal<br />
10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
Imperial Vizier Zor'lok (Heart of Fear) - 25 Player Normal<br />
12:00 PDT (15:00 EDT, 21:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Protectors of the Endless (Terrace of Endless Spring) - 25 Player Normal<br />
13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
Feng the Accursed (Mogu'shan Vaults) - 25 Player Normal<br />
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Blade Lord Ta'yak (Heart of Fear) - 25 Player Normal<br />
16:30 PDT (19:30 EDT, 01:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
Tsulong (Terrace of Endless Spring) - 25 Player Normal<br />
18:00 PDT (21:00 EDT, 03:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session or cancel it entirely, due to bugs, builds, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
I updated the schedule slightly to space the encounters out a bit more evenly. <br />
<br />
Our testing times are not designed to be universally convenient -- some times will be ideal for some time zones, and terrible for others, and we try to spread that out. We're not expecting people to log on at 3am local time to test a raid for an hour (though we understand that some will do so), but at the same time, a large number of North American players miss a majority of the boss times because they occur during work hours during the week, and nearly all the times are poor for Oceanic players. <br />
<br />
The earlier times are meant to be more convenient for EU players, and the later times in each session are more convenient for NA players, while still fitting within a standard work day for the designers who need to observe their encounters for feedback and tuning purposes.<br />
<br />
25-Heroic testing will look more like the 10-Heroic scheduling you've seen in recent weeks.<br />
<br />

Can't stand these so-called hardcore players that seem to spend more time whinging about what OTHERS can have, than enjoying what they can have LONG before everyone else...usually, at times the &quot;hardcore&quot; player is more bark than bite, really. <br />
<br />
People who play games to feel superior to other people REALLY need to get themselves something constructive to do in life. If you can't enjoy a game unless you can feel superior to others, then you shouldn't be playing games at all...you should be getting some help.</div></div><hr />

Even if what you said true about the hardcore players worked harder to gain the rewards and achiev and all of that stuff. They shouldn't care about if other less hardcore and casual players get the same reward later on in the future or something like that, this is not the point here the point here tbh did you enjoy it? did you enjoy being a hardcore and downed the boss and got your achievement kill date before everyone else? if yes then that's it. :)<br />
<br />
That's the entire point of playing this game you play to enjoy yourself with your friends not to stalk others player to see if they did it the same as you but with less efforts because of bla bla nerfs and stuff they shouldn't care about it and they should have confident about themselves being a better player without having more rewards and shiney stuff before other players.

Because the ones doing the whining aren't the true hardcores. If they don't have world first or were even in the RACE for world first, then they aren't the best of the best and their for have no reason to whine. Yet they do because they want to feel as if they are part of the best group, when that gets nerfed so do their dreams. :)<br />
<br />
I would also like point out that when the daily blink &quot;makes fun of casuals&quot; no one really complains, not even the casuals yet the moment the tables are turned the tears start falling and people like you run to their defense. To be honest, they don't need defending, the river of tears they cry will drown most &quot;attackers&quot; and is defense enough.</div></div><hr />

And yet most people do care, so the question for you should be why. And maybe if you ever get in the shoes of those players you'll understand. Its human psychology, in game like that the ego, the epeen, the individuality matters to a lot of people, especially to those who spend more time in it. People who beat harder content pride themselves for the achievement, they have the gear that other people ,who don't put as much time and effort, don't. And then comes a day and that person who players 5 times less looks exactly same as you, it drains all that sense of accomplishment.</div></div><hr />

Exactly this, The people who are whinning aren't even hardcore players, they just want the stuff and feel superior over everyone else, but when the stuff is to hard for them they will complain and call for nerfs.</div></div><hr />

Exactly this?<br />
First of all I didnt know theres another category &quot;true hardcore&quot; players. By definition if people raid 3 times a week and show up regularly, they are pretty hardcore, no matter their progress. And its usually the opposite - those that have accomplished something before nerfs, don't want content nerfed. Which is why someone like me didn't want 5 man heroics nerfed because I had already done glory of the hero ^_^.</div></div><hr />

What about people that play the game for the enjoyment of the challenge?

Sounds like those people are playing the wrong game. It's been since Wrath that we have had people moaning that the challenge has been sucked out the game and I can agree to a certain extent (though I wouldn't necessarily include the inclusion of easier modes in that) but that's been almost four years now. Four years of complaining that the challenge has been sucked out, a rational person would have moved on to where the challenging gameplay was.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, a player who beat heroic DW with a 5% nerf put more time into it than a player who downed it with a 30% nerf? Which took longer? That argument lacks logic. You did it when it was harder, huzzah for you, now shut up and let other people enjoy themselves.</div></div><hr />

Trust me, none of the people on the forums complaining like 3 year olds are people who developed strats or did anything first. That really is the biggest shame about this entire fiasco... hardcore raiders are getting a bad name because the wanna-be-hardcore raiders are making idiots of themselves.<br />

Farmville? Really? This is why I don't play WoW anymore<br />

eh.. really? We´ve been able to pick flowers since day 1 of vanilla.. somehow you have no problem with that, but you have a problem with us killing 8 wolves and afterwards being able to pick flowers? Not to mention there have already been dozens of quests where you go somewhere and plant a seed in a plot of earth and watch a tree grow ( molten front anyone).. oh those dang fire druids, always trying to burn down my farmville.</div></div><hr />

10 days after the release of MoP, we have Brewfest with updated loots (trinkets). Isn't it too early to get ourselves epic trinkets? Not that it will be hard to get early epic gear with LFR on starting raids but still... feels kinda weird to me.</div></div><hr />

That by nerfing the game, and make it shitton easier all the time, the game as a whole gets worse and less enjoyable and fun as the nerfs increases. Then people will say &quot;but hey, what about people who ENJOY doing Dragon Soul heroic with 30% nerf and can't do better?&quot;. Well, there's normal-mode for those guys, and if they want heroic, man up and get better. Or do they REALLY need to have heroic under their merits to say that they have enjoyed the game?

<br />
Tbh with you a video gamer who quit a game because someone else got better stuff than him is not a true player at least in my opinion. Some people must learn to play the game to enjoy it as a game for themselves instead of watching others if they got something better than them or stuff like that.<br />

The game is not about just getting BiS gears in a raid them booom gamer over nothing to do..in fact there is a lot of things to do in this game other than pvp or pve.<br />
<br />
Examples will be hunting achievements, hunting transmog gears, dailies, and ofc creating alts..I can go on forever with this but unfortunately some people see WoW just raids + pvp that's all then when they finish all of the raids and pvp they say the game has nothing...which is very wrong tbh.</div></div><hr />

I play PVE, I'm as casual as it gets, I raid Dragon Soul ONCE in a pug, got lucky and got two upgrades, after that I join LFR (the very next day) go strait into death wing fight, I killed him with that group, stayed on top of the healing charts AND (lucky again) 2 more upgrades including the healer mace..<br />
Deathwing is dead, I saved the world, there will be no next tier so I don't need better gear.... game over for me!<br />
<br />
ok I could go Normal, yes I could go HC, but what for? its the same scenario!<br />
And has for all that stuff you say we can go out and do, thats to do between one raid and the next, those were just fillers to what the game used to be all about, PVE.<br />
Really go and read the &quot;we consume content too fast&quot; topic, me and many other posters gave very good insight on what could be done to improve the game for everyone (yes everyone)</div></div><hr />

Again... same thing I will say World of Warcraft is not just raids and pve and if you can only enjoy one aspect of this game and don't like pvp or achievements, or dailies, or questing or all the stuff I mentioned then this is not the problem of the game but instead this is the problem of the player him/herself for only choosing to enjoy only one aspect of the game..that's my point, just because you only enjoy pve (one aspect of the game) only and nothing else doesn't mean the game very bad or doesn't offer anything atm.</div></div><hr />

Really go and read the &quot;we consume content too fast&quot; topic, me and many other posters gave very good insight on what could be done to improve the game for everyone (yes everyone)<br />
<br />
I have honestly kept up with the thread and disagree with most of the replies and solutions and I doubt the solutions proposed would satisfy everyone since that thread doesn't speak for everyone.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Milton</div><div class="date">2012-07-30, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again... same thing I will say World of Warcraft is not just raids and pve and if you can only enjoy one aspect of this game and don't like pvp or achievements, or dailies, or questing or all the stuff I mentioned then this is not the problem of the game but instead this is the problem of the player him/herself for only choosing to enjoy only one aspect of the game..that's my point, just because you only enjoy pve (one aspect of the game) only and nothing else doesn't mean the game very bad or doesn't offer anything atm. did I said it was bad? dis I said I did not enjoy nothing else? I enjoy PVE the most cos thats why I started playing this game in the first place... so again go read the thread cos I wont be typing the same things twice, but long story short you used to take some time to progress you character (or a new alt) on PVE, now you do it in 2 weeks after you ding 85. That is my point, can I just get to teh top ladder of PVP, or get most of the achievements, or do all the quests, or farm transmog gear (I play for several years and I saved everything I wanted over time so I dont need to go back anyway), etc in two weeks?<br />

<br />
I did read that post mate don't worry. :)<br />
<br />
but again if some people only enjoy one aspect of the game that doesn't make the game boring or have nothing to offer I exactly understand your point but yes this game has a lot of things instead of just pve and raids. However, yes Cata compare to previous expansions has less of what to do than say wotlk or TBC or even vanilla but that doesn't mean the game has nothing to offer or boring it's not boring for me yes I have been playing my main a lot have /played 589 days total and I'm still playing and enjoy every second of this game either it's pvp or pve or achievements or the many aspects of this game. Ofc I'm not expecting every player should be exactly the same style of playing as me ofc not but there are a lot of players who also enjoy the game not just for raiding and pve but for also the additional stuff inside the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, the hardcore raiders that you see on the forums, I wouldn't be so fast to associate the majority with these guys. Even though we do often agree with some of the points raised in difficulty changes and rolling nerfs, some of the points put forward by these 'hardcore' players are so daft, onesided and narrowmind and achieve nothing but bring a bad name to not just other hardcore raiders, but raiders in general.<br />
If rolling nerfs are going to be brought out, all I'd like to see is some titles or mere vanity items getting locked off after a certain point of time, achievement dates (something that is hardly ever checked and we're told by Blizzard is what we should be looking at) isn't something other players will ooh and aah at, which is all what the hardcore players I know seem to want.</div></div><hr />

Hardcore raiders, such as myself, who race for world/us firsts. We dont CARE when you down content, we honestly couldnt careless that your so bad at such an easy game, that you need to get a 30%+ (Not counting individual boss nerfs, for this tier specifically Heroic Spine, it now has like an overall 50 - 60% total nerf to the tendons, which was the only challenging part of the fight) to down content we did with less then half your gear.<br />
<br />
As far as the Daily Blink goes, that isnt a hardcore raiders perspective. If you honestly think ANYONE in a Serious, Hardcore guild sits around talking about how the uber casuals down the content we have had on farm, and farm on our alts, think again. That perspective is based on the Semi Hardcore, the ones that are slightly above average, and do themselves require said nerfs at one point, then complain it was too much<br />
<br />
Why would we complain that they nerf content after we have cleared it? OH NOEZ BLIZZ DONT MAKE THE DUNGEON EASIER FOR US TO RECLEAR EACH WEEK!!!!</div></div><hr />

Blizzard should just send a full set of heroic gear, mounts and titles in the mailbox when you ding 85. Thats what blizzard's current game design will descend to eventually.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 days after the release of MoP, we have Brewfest with updated loots (trinkets). Isn't it too early to get ourselves epic trinkets? Not that it will be hard to get early epic gear with LFR on starting raids but still... feels kinda weird to me.<br />
<br />
Their item level is below that of items found in Raid Finder and the trinkets themselves tend be pretty weak when compared to similar level trinkets. I'm not too fussed about it and am happy to finally get some useful stuff for a main character from seasonal bosses if I get unlucky with drops.</div></div><hr />

I get the joke, but comparing going to the moon and being upset at random nerfs are very different. Besides, it's the freaking moon.<br />
<br />
It would be funny if it was cut and dry even if the analogies were still biased. The moon is a good example, it is still the freaking moon. Neil Armstrong did not change that. But if they built an amusement park there are started bussing people there it is suddenly no longer a destination of a worthy endervor. It is then just a scenic view pull-off along the highway.<br />
<br />
It really does not matter what the destination is if the journey is not there. Never raided Cata before, joined LFR once, killed Deathwing in like 45 minutes. Very unrewarding experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it feels more like Harvest Moon then Farmville, its just another feature like everything else in the game you don't have to use this feature to enjoy the overall experience. I personally would rather do this then sit in a capital city looking at chat, but others might disagree.<br />
I don't really care if its like some other game or feature in another game if it makes someones experience more enjoyable then it does its job. Not everything in the game has to be for everyone.<br />

It´s your decision to play it on easy/LFR. <br />
If you buy a singleplayer game with difficulty settings easy, normal and hard, do you play on easy and later complain that you beat it too fast ? Funnily thats what happened to Kingdoms or Amalur : Reckoning. Many people complained on its forums that the game is way to easy and later the devs noticed through their feedback tools that more than two thirds of the player played it on easy.<br />
<br />
If you want more of a challenge then play your raids in normal modes in the future. I really don´t see the problem.<br />

not a single player game though, even though a lot of people seem to treat it as solo experience which is why they have the &quot;i dont care what other people do and when they do it, you shouldn't either&quot; mentality.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruffertus</div><div class="date">2012-07-30, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And yet most people do care, so the question for you should be why. And maybe if you ever get in the shoes of those players you'll understand. Its human psychology, in game like that the ego, the epeen, the individuality matters to a lot of people, especially to those who spend more time in it. People who beat harder content pride themselves for the achievement, they have the gear that other people ,who don't put as much time and effort, don't. And then comes a day and that person who players 5 times less looks exactly same as you, it drains all that sense of accomplishment.<br />
<br />
No, let's be clear here, most people don't care that much, it's not human psychology so much as aberrant psychology that gets obsessed with other people's happiness erasing theirs. Blizzard used to cater to that, thankfully they don't now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Hey guys, <br />
<br />
We are aware that many of you are concerned about not having enough time to level up and such, which is a concern we fully acknowledge, as we know that many of you would like to enjoy and experience the new areas and content at your own pace, and not feel like you have to rush through things and level up as fast as possible just to have a go at the Brewfest dungeon boss. <br />
<br />
Therefore, In order to make sure you guys have some more time to prepare for this year's Brewfest, we have pushed the whole event forward by just over a week, stopping short of overlapping with the Hallow’s End event.&quot;<br />

Evidence? How is it &quot;clear&quot; what most people think? Yours is just one opinion and doesn't represent that of &quot;most&quot;. And it has nothing to do with other people's happiness, those people don't care at all if youre happiest person on earth. They aren't happy when something of theirs is so significantly devalued, like imagine you had a diamond - awesome, not many people has a diamond its a valuable, precious thing. Next day it rains diamonds from the sky - now your diamond is worthless, you don't even want it anymore, you rather have a fake diamond since its more rare. Ofcourse any person who would probably never come close getting a diamond if there wasn't a diamond-rain are gonna be happy with it, thats also human psychology, if they had spent time and effort getting a diamond they would've had a different perspective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
then don't nerf Normal and HC after a couple of months.. get my point now?<br />
<br />
-LFR should take players into a game arranged Normal mode PUG... then, after some time, those nerfs could be applied onto LFR only, so any player could see the content (a side effect would be raids organized by lower end guilds have meaning again). But that nerf should take quite a few time to get out, like right before the next content patch or expansion, or gradually on a boss basis (were if you kill a nerfed boss you get nerfed loot from him). That way If I chose to run Normal modes with my guild, I wouldn't feel like I was missing anything.. Have you ever tried to explain the raid leader that you haven't done that boss on LFR cause you chose to play normal only? Any tactics given start like &quot;ok this is like the LFR mode but with this and that change&quot;; this and the fact that you are 'forced' by the other raid members to farm LFR gear to go into Normal modes makes your argument fail.. I don't want to go into the same instance twice even if the difficulty get higher, I want to chose my difficulty and not be forced to run it the easy way go the way I want the second time around.</div></div><hr />
