funny enough, the best tanks currently are all without brezzes. the problem with vengeance is that they are squishy. and they dont make up for it by having ridiculous dps.</div></div><hr />

Isn't the only strength of Vengeance that it can kite really well?? I think that's about it. Other tanks do more damage or heal more or reduce damage more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kiting doesn't belong in tanking, it's not fun to run around just keeping aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It isn't the battle res that is the problem. What really needs to happen is for a caster DPS meta to swing round, if that happens then you can get the res from Boomkins or Warlocks, the interrupts of the vengeance tank becomes very valuable since you lack melee and getting the extra magic damage from the tank becomes very desirable. Also as soon as the mitigation of DH is brought up to par with that of a DK you'll see DH move past DK pretty fast since they just do more damage.<br />
<br />
It's not just that DH tanks are bad, it is that all the things that synergise with them in a group are also not in great spots right now which makes them even less desirable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This^ AND possibly get rid of META for VENG.. it is a terrible ability and high CD and give us something we can use on a lower CD to mitigate magic damage or something. I mean i dont know why Blizzard finds it so hard to bring things closer together in terms of balance.</div></div><hr />

Classes are all well and good but it’d be nice if the story team changed the abomination that is the 8.2 War Campaign while they’re at it.</div></div><hr />

My mind was blown when they didn't bake the legs legendary into the VDH base kit in BfA beta...<br />
<br />
Blizzard is just clueless about tanking in their game. When you havee some tanks with 100% AM uptime and on the other side terrible uptime on VDH (or even protpaladin). I just can't understand.</div></div><hr />
