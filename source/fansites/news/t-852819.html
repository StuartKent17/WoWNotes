Since the release of patch 4.0.6, we’ve been keeping an eye on healers and how they are performing and are currently in the process of making some additional adjustments.<br />
<br />
Priests<br />
<br />
The cost of Power Word: Shield is being increased by 33%. While we wanted Discipline priests to be able to utilize this spell more often and with better results, we also did not want it to be the main spell (and often the only spell) used while in groups. We don’t find this to be a particularly compelling playstyle and have found that it encourages players to avoid using other spells such as Penance. We believe that using a shield in a tight moment is totally appropriate, but we don’t want it to be incredibly efficient to do so with more frequency than that.<br />
<br />
We realize that by making Power Word: Shield slightly more expensive for Discipline priests to cast that it might cause Holy priests to avoid using it. To that end, we are adding mana savings into the Body and Soul talent. The tooltip will not reflect this change until a future patch, however. Ideally, Holy priests should not notice much of a change to the Power Word: Shield costs.<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
We are also applying a hotfix for Purification for the Restoration shaman passive from 10% to 25%. We think that shaman healing per second is not as competitive with other healers and while we hoped to bring down Holy priest and Holy paladins (in particular) in 4.0.6, which we did, shaman still appear to be behind. In this case, it is simply easier to buff Restoration shaman rather than nerf everyone else or rebalance the encounters.<br />
<br />
In Addition- Restoration Druids and Restoration Shaman<br />
<br />
We agree with the sentiment among some players that Restoration druids and Restoration shaman are lacking in the healing cooldown department. The shaman buff and Power Word: Shield adjustment above should bring all healers reasonably close in terms of throughput. The decision on who to bring then might end up being dictated by the strong cooldowns offered by paladins or priests. This isn’t the kind of thing we can address via a hotfix, but it is something we are looking at for the next major content patch.<br />
<br />
As always, we appreciate your continued constructive feedback and will do our best to keep you informed of ongoing developments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tranquility is one cooldown. Priests and Paladins have tons.<br />
<br />
I think they mean they want to give Druids like 1-2 more, and Shaman like 2-3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think this could have been made much easier, and simpler by just saying the following:<br />
<br />
We apologise to Discipline Priest players but the only way to make having multiple discipline priests in a 10-man raid not want to kill each other is to reduce the use of Power Word: Shield. For this reason we are increasing it's mana cost in an attempt to make you use it less often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Napkin-math and top WoL parses is showing that it should be a pretty unanimous 1000-1500 HPS increase overall, with certain fights (eg. Chimaeron), seeing substantially higher results, definitely with the potential to reach a 2000 HPS increase.<br />
<br />
Since we just lost both of our Resto Druids and are now forced to run two Resto Shamans for a while (me being one of them), I have to admit... I LOVE this change. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basicly meaing they are punishing shadowpriest in both pvp (and pve to some degree) for Disc priest who were spamming PW:S most of the time. <br />
I really hate that they punish shadow priest for this, they already nerfed our passive increased shadow damage (which I agree was comming) but now also increase the mana cost of staying alive in PvP as shadow. Shadow priest were in a pretty decent spot before but this will certainly make it harder to conserve mana</div></div><hr />

<br />
By cooldown I am almost certain that what is being referred to is some method to prevent tank death on a reasonably short cooldown which can be mixed with what other classes can offer and can be used multiple times per encounter.<br />
<br />
Currently, Druids and Shaman offer nothing of this sort so the term &quot;compared to Priests&quot; is certainly fair.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frankieo</div><div class="date">2011-02-16, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People have fucking stopped playing discipline priest and holy priest simply due to the fact that they SUCK ASS right now, the only spell for discipline that can keep up healing against the mass of damage our team takes in a regular 5 man dungeon, is... drum roll... FLASH HEAL, it currently costs over 5k mana, and casts in around 1.3sec with around 600 haste or something more.<br />
What else can we cast? Penance, ok, that costs shit loads of mana, has a long cd timer on it, and is usually never ready for use when its really needed, also, it sucks as if the tank really needs healing, and that fast, Penance only gets in 1 heal (3k - 5k health), and sap, the tank is dead.<br />
So, now we have 1 more healing spell, what is that? oh, that is called Heal, it costs over 2k - 3k mana, and cast time is 2.3sec with over 1000 haste. Now, this is really not a valid healing spell, as it only heals for less then 7k health, witch sounds awesome at first, until you step into a dungeon for the first time and find yourself going oom after every single group pull because people just simply cannot believe that Crowd Control is actually something GOOD TO USE!<br />
<br />
Blizzard, if you really want to make things hard and still have people play discipline, see to it that you fucking change some of the cast times on the spells, and halven all the mana costs. It is not playable the way you are fucking your players right now!</div></div><hr />

If they are going to do this to disc priests. then they need to move Improved Power Word: Shield farther down in the Disc tree. Holy priests shouldn't have the same shielding ability as disc.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I suppose it could just be a matter of semantics, but they specifically said &quot;healing cooldown&quot; which I would most definitely file Tree of Life and Tranquility under, as well as Divine Hymn and the like. Guardian Spirit is a hell of a powerful cooldown, but as you said it just prevents one tank death, while tranquility heals up most of a small raid to full and divine hymn fills up part of a small raid to half.<br />

Again it could just be semantics and they're not communicating exactly what they meant by cooldown properly, but in the blanket discussion of &quot;healing&quot; cooldowns Holy Priests could use some love with divine hymn if they're going to compare it to resto druids. Even more so if resto druids end up getting a cooldown on the level of guardian spirit, as then they'll have similar cooldowns but holy priests will have the weaker spell for a raid healing cooldown.<br />

Guardian Spirit is a hell of a powerful cooldown, but as you said it just prevents one tank death, while tranquility heals up most of a small raid to full and divine hymn fills up part of a small raid to half.<br />
<br />
Again it could just be semantics and they're not communicating exactly what they meant by cooldown properly, but in the blanket discussion of &quot;healing&quot; cooldowns Holy Priests could use some love with divine hymn if they're going to compare it to resto druids. Even more so if resto druids end up getting a cooldown on the level of guardian spirit, as then they'll have similar cooldowns but holy priests will have the weaker spell for a raid healing cooldown.<br />
<br />
As for shaman, they just need all the help they can get right now.<br />
<br />
I would be very surprised if Tranquility and Divine Hymn remain as they are currently with this change; it is highly likely that either Tranquility will be reduced or Divine Hymn increased in through-put so as to better balance these cooldowns which remain distinct from other abilities as they can only be used once per encounter the vast majority of time. They may be better likened to Soulstone or Rebirth where usage is restricted (both by differing means however).<br />
<br />
I would just like to clarify that Tree of Life really cannot be listed as a cooldown in the sense of PW:B, Aura Mastery or GS. Tree of Life, to be utilised as a raid cooldown, requires a high ramp up time (the distribution of Lifebloom over the raid members) and offers no other tools to try and save a tank, less the use of an inordinate amount of mana spamming instant cast Regrowth. No other &quot;cooldown&quot; offers such a double edged nature which requires a paradigm shift in playstyle and a high penalty if used to quickly attempt to prevent a death.<br />
<br />
In fact, Tree of Life is better likened to a mana regeneration cooldown for periods of standard damage as Rejuvenation can be substituted at this point to the less expensive Lifebloom.<br />
<br />
Yes, it is a matter of semantics, but these semantics are important when trying to distinguish the relative worth of healers - perhaps with these changes they may actually give druids a means to deal with burst AoE damage in addition to a proper healing cooldown.</div></div><hr />

Ah resto druid efficient heals have high cast times (Nourish and Healing Touch are at 2.1 seconds with 21.5% haste that's around 2200 haste) along with every other healer<br />

Casting shield on everyone else does lets you get on top of the healing+absorb charts but i don't think thats the direction Blizz would like to take. In 4.0.3 we really had to rely on Greater Heal and Heal to heal up the raid which was a change from the conventional Disc priests in WOTLK. I truly think that this is a good change as shields should only be cast upon tanks and members who are close to death.</div></div><hr />

Not fun for some, im a resto druid and i love having to actually work to heal other than just spamming rejuv and WG on CD get gear everything becomes alot less mana intensive once your in full heroic gear with some purples i have 113k mana in half blues half purples and i almost never go oom. You cant spam anymore you do you oom simple as that use other heals its really not that hard once you figure out what to use at different times.<br />
<br />
Mostly just never use your mana intensive stuff unless someone is about to die or its a AoE phase then after that use your mana efficient stuff to gain back mana.</div></div><hr />

I seldom finish a fight without using them all, and I seldom find myself in need of one more cooldown. Druids could use some damage reduction cooldown... for example thorns could be a cooldown instead that removes 30% damage for the next 3 hits or something... shammys.. they could add a cooldown which lets earth shield &quot;tick&quot; for every boss hit for example.

<br />
I COULD be mistaken, but, I believe, when they say healing cooldowns, they are discussing only cooldowns that directly influence healing output. All healers have at least one on-demand mana return spell (Divine Plea, Innervate, Shadowfiend, Hymn of Hope, Mana Tide Totem) and while they definitely are not all equal on amount of mana returned, I think the Shaman hot-fix is based purely on healing output and NOT mana returns. <br />
<br />
I don't think Shamans necessarily &quot;need&quot; as many cooldowns as other classes, but, frankly, it would be nice to have at least one &quot;oh shit&quot; button to pop when many people (or simply the tank) are going to drop if they do not get lots of heals RIGHT NOW. Nature's Swiftness is nice, but just feels too weak to actually prevent something bad from happening. Personal opinion, of course.</div></div><hr />

I respectfully disagree. The problem is most healers are used to sitting back and playing Whack-a-mole and not paying attention to anything. I'm having quite a bit of fun with both my Shaman and Paladin healing. I like the challenge, I like having to think about everything I cast because there is consequence (mana or cooldown waste).<br />

I agree with the mana tide part, DiamondTear. The reason Resto Shaman don't agree with having less powerful healing cooldowns in return for more powerful mana cooldowns is the same reason Shadow Priests hated being brought for utility in exchange for their damage output back in TBC.<br />
<br />
People play a DPS to DPS and a Healer to Healer, and sadly, they don't really care about restoring the mana of other healers.</div></div><hr />

Word of Glory<br />
Holy Shock <br />
Hand of Sacrifice<br />
Aura Mastery<br />
Avenging Wrath<br />

Judgement<br />
<br />
Then there are the self cooldowns like:<br />
Divine Shield<br />
Divine Protection<br />
(here's a hint you should be using those bubbles during the times you expect to take a lot of damage).<br />
<br />
All I do during a fight is cooldown managment, and with Beacon and Protector of the Innocent all of my heals are &quot;aoe&quot; like. <br />
<br />
I play a holy Paly and if not before, I expect at Tier 2 raiding we will see a nerf, probably to Meditation or higher mana costs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what seperates Disc priests and Holy priests is that Holy priests have all the disc tools, more efficient AND their own set of spells.<br />
<br />
The whole point of disc priests is that they prevent damage. Penance is poor and the CD is bleh. Meaning if Penance is on CD and shields are too expensive, you're a holy priest without the decent spells.<br />
<br />
I don't see why they cannot just removed the weakened soul debuff from disc priests combined with a weaker mana change, or completely left field, add an efficient 2s cast time shield, to replace the normal spammer spell. Obviously only one can be active at a time. But really, there is nothing interesting or rewarding about Disc priests.</div></div><hr />

Also I am amazed at the Paly's in this thread. I have switched to my Holy Paly about a month ago so I could continue raiding and I am very disappointed in many of you Palys who are griping about a way underpowered class that even with this massive buff that will still not likely bring it close to in line with the healing throughput of paladins, and even with some c/d love &quot;in a later content patch&quot; pally have almost a dozen huge situational toys to play with with the Shamans having what? Hex and Mana Tide (the only reason we would even be occasionally invited to a raid, because it certainly wasn't our healing)?</div></div><hr />

The buff to Power Word: Shield along with the stacking divine aegis for PoH crits/hits is the defining strengths of the entire spec. Yes<br />
shield spam might not be the most skilled way to play, but there are better ways to nerf it other than simply increasing the mana cost.<br />
My Power Word: Shield costs 4632 mana to cost right now, with the 33% change thatd be over 6k. If you pretend that shielding is the same<br />
as healing, power word shield heals for about 25-30k hp depending on gear and Greater Heal which costs 5559 mana heals for about<br />
25k with 3 stacks of grace. If it gets increased to over 6k, than there would be absolutely no reason to cast it. Rapture currently returns more mana<br />
when the shield breaks than it costs to cast it, it would (post-nerf) return less mana than the shield costs. The nerf would utterly destroy<br />
the usefulness of shield.<br />
Now I do not find myself shield spamming in raids. I keep shields on all the tanks, maybe shield 1-2 people if there taking damage from a specific thing,<br />
and generally Prayer of healing groups. I don't want to sound like a typical angry troll trying to offer advice on how to fix it, but I did think of<br />
a useful way to change it so it still remains a useful spell, but prevents the shield spam playstyle. Just simply limit Power Word: Shield to 4-5 targets at a time, or limit the<br />
amount of Weakened soul's that can be active on the group at one time. This way you have enough shields to give to all the tanks on cd (to help with tank healing) while giving a little bit of elbow room to shield targets taking massive damage who could use one. <br />
Most of the time when Blizzard decides to nerf/buff, they don't change there mind, no matter how stupid the nerf/buff is, but hopefully they view that as an acceptable alternative to the unintelligent and downright lazy change to the spell that any average player could have come up with. Nerfing/Buffing classes and spells is and should not be as simple as just increasing/decreasing the mana cost.<br />
Please reconsider this Blizzard. Most Disc players love where you took the spec, please don't undo all the good you've done.<br />

No self-respecting priest wants to bubble spam. Sure they want to be effective, and so they do whatever works best, but if they had a choice they would simply be balanced PvE and PvP healers with a niche to call their own. Raising the mana costs doesn't change anything; worst case it delays bubble spam until next tier when we'll have to revisit the issue yet again. Disc has a mastery DEVOTED to shields. 1/3 of the talent tree is DEVOTED to shields. Find a better solution, this is just absurd. EJ and the wow forums are full of suggestions that limit shield spam (which is really only a problem in 25m on certain fights at certain, HIGH gear levels). PvP priests hurt for mana more than any other healer currently, and this is going to make it worse in exchange for DELAYING a problem until next tier. <br />
<br />
What's worse is that Disc could really be a unique, but balanced, healing class in PvP and PvE. Having a mastery devoted to essentially a single spell and then saying you should only be using that spell for emergencies is the type of thinking that prevents it from ever coming into its own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm seeing some major problems with this logic.<br />
<br />
If we're going to call shielding healing, then your Power Word: Shield will be more mana efficient than my Divine Light, even after this nerf. My Divine Light hits for about 25k and costs 6k mana AND it has a 2+ second cast time.<br />
<br />
I don't see the problem with a shield being 6k. That isn't that bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
If it gets increased to over 6k, than there would be absolutely no reason to cast it. Rapture currently returns more mana<br />
when the shield breaks than it costs to cast it, it would (post-nerf) return less mana than the shield costs. The nerf would utterly destroy<br />
the usefulness of shield.<br />
<br />
I don't understand this point either. When I bomb huge heals into the raid, I'm fine with not getting -more mana back than I cast-. Getting even as little as half of a cost of a shield back seems fair - it encourages smart use instead of spamming.</div></div><hr />

Paladins have the most powerful raid healing and utility cooldowns in the game right now.</div></div><hr />

FLASH HEAL, it currently costs over 5k mana, and casts in around 1.3sec with around 600 haste or something more.<br />
What else can we cast? Penance, ok, that costs shit loads of mana, has a long cd timer on it, and is usually never ready for use when its really needed, also, it sucks as if the tank really needs healing, and that fast, Penance only gets in 1 heal (3k - 5k health), and sap, the tank is dead.<br />
So, now we have 1 more healing spell, what is that? oh, that is called Heal, it costs over 2k - 3k mana, and cast time is 2.3sec with over 1000 haste. Now, this is really not a valid healing spell, as it only heals for less then 7k health, witch sounds awesome at first, until you step into a dungeon for the first time and find yourself going oom after every single group pull because people just simply cannot believe that Crowd Control is actually something GOOD TO USE!<br />
<br />
Blizzard, if you really want to make things hard and still have people play discipline, see to it that you fucking change some of the cast times on the spells, and halven all the mana costs. It is not playable the way you are fucking your players right now!<br />
<br />
If Flash Heal is the only viable spell for you as Disc in 5-mans, then the rest of your team is doing something wrong. I have absolutely no problems healing 5-mans as Disc. In fact, when the tank sucks and DPS are pulling aggro all over the place, I'm kind of glad because it gives me something to do. Greater Heal, PoM, Penance, Shield, Renew, Binding Heal. I use all of it in 5-mans with no mana problems and no throughput problems.<br />
<br />
Raids are the same. Disc is not only playble, it is fun and competitive with the other specs.<br />
<br />
What you are basically asking for is a return to Wrath healing (&quot;lower cast times, half all the mana costs&quot;... sounds like shield + flash heal spam in ICC to me).</div></div><hr />

Divine Favor<br />
Holy Radiance<br />
Light of Dawn <br />
Word of Glory<br />
Holy Shock <br />
Hand of Sacrifice<br />
Aura Mastery<br />
Avenging Wrath<br />
Guardian of Ancient Kings<br />
Judgement<br />
<br />
Then there are the self cooldowns like:<br />
Divine Shield<br />
Divine Protection<br />
(here's a hint you should be using those bubbles during the times you expect to take a lot of damage).<br />
<br />
All I do during a fight is cooldown managment, and with Beacon and Protector of the Innocent all of my heals are &quot;aoe&quot; like. <br />
<br />
I play a holy Paly and if not before, I expect at Tier 2 raiding we will see a nerf, probably to Meditation or higher mana costs.<br />
<br />
Judgement is a raid healing CD srs bsns<br />
<br />
And tbh, I don't count judgement as a supah l33t mana regen tool as it restores base mana.. as a lot of ppl seem to forget, so as we get further in the expansion it'll become useless.</div></div><hr />

than your other healers really need to pick up the slack since they are not performing up to par vs the peers of the class they play. No i am not making that up it is easily documented and found on sites like worldoflogs</div></div><hr />

I was very comfortable with the mana costs of everything, but nope, Blizz has to go and mess it up. Though, I shouldn't complain yet, we'll see how bad it is. <br />
<br />
Also, maybe I'm the only one that plays like this, (though I did see a few other similar posts), You shouldn't be shield spamming like we could in wrath, it's already a little too costly for that. I usually cast it on a tank at the beginning of a pull, then as needed later. Like, when I need that extra second to cast Greater Heal on a tank, or someone else is taking a lot of damage(but not standing in the fire! lol), but the tank is still taking more damage than can be left alone for second or two. <br />
<br />
Someone else mentioned a cooldown on PW:S. There kinda is. You can't cast it on the same person for another 15 sec. Yes if you use Heal it's lower, but generally the don't need another bubble after that. Maybe I'm getting confused between the PvPers talking and the PvE-ers talking.</div></div><hr />

Im gonna love playing my resto shaman EVEN more now! Though being behind on meters atm, i still love playing it, and getting the 25% increase + potential new cooldowns at some point, makes me wanna worship blizzard :P<br />
<br />
Our cooldowns is a joke right now. nature's swiftness is only something i use when i see a player dive fast, so i use unleash elements + NS + GHW to get it up there.<br />
Spiritwalkers grace? How often do you even use that? ive used it 2 times durring maybe 100 hours of raiding. Using it to get away from bad stuff makes no sense, because you got nothing to do in that bad stuff. IF you end up in it, you are out of it really fast anyways + having atleast 1 more healer with you with either a bubble, instant heal or heavy dots + your own instant as i explained.<br />
<br />
Im not crying over anything, im simply just happy with the changes overall + the forgotten love we are getting some of again :)<br />
<br />
Btw: All posts here clearly shows that druid and shaman players actually like their class/role and not crying everytime they see their class being mentioned. <br />

<br />
If we're going to call shielding healing, then your Power Word: Shield will be more mana efficient than my Divine Light, even after this nerf. My Divine Light hits for about 25k and costs 6k mana AND it has a 2+ second cast time.<br />
<br />
I don't see the problem with a shield being 6k. That isn't that bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't understand this point either. When I bomb huge heals into the raid, I'm fine with not getting -more mana back than I cast-. Getting even as little as half of a cost of a shield back seems fair - it encourages smart use instead of spamming.<br />
<br />
Rapture is Blizzard's way of fixing the insane mana issues Disc had early in cata. By making PW:S cost more mana to cast than Rapture returns, disc priests go back to having little to no real mana regen and not being able to heal a full 8 minutes (average heroic boss length) without sitting on their hands for a good minute doing absolutely nothing.</div></div><hr />

Everyone's cast times and mana costs are high right now. That's the way things work in Cataclysm. You have to manage your mana and pick the right spells to use.World of Logs has and never will matter when it comes to justifying discipline priests. Not only are healing meters always going to be skewed towards discipline due to the reliance of mitigating damage, it's also going to skew overall how much of a benefit you're providing to the raid. If you think current shielding 30k is that overpowered when hardmodes are hitting for 100k+ damage, then you must be clueless.</div></div><hr />

Respecing to Disc after patch was no-brainer for me. Sure, mana isn't infinite, so it wasn't completely WotLK style bubble spam, but it was good enough to easily top meters, without using any other spell. No innervate stacking or anything like it. Using Holy gear, where I didn't exactly stack mastery and could get quite a bit more with some additional reforging.<br />

It's quite amusing that Disc Priests are &quot;suprised&quot; by this nerf. You knew it was coming - maybe not in exactly this form, but shield spam was superior to any other healing, with inability to stack Discs being it's only disadvantage.<br />

And tbh, I don't count judgement as a supah l33t mana regen tool as it restores base mana.. as a lot of ppl seem to forget, so as we get further in the expansion it'll become useless.<br />
<br />
Uh yeah. It's a HUGE part of mana regen and a slight heal thanks to Beacon, I don't care how downplayed you feel it will be at the end of the expansion. If you're not using as frequently as you can as a Paladin, you fail. End of story. <br />
<br />
Just tack it on to the end of the long list though that you're ignoring to try to make my point seem any less valid. We Paladins have NO justifiable room for lack of CD complaints.</div></div><hr />

No self-respecting priest wants to bubble spam. Sure they want to be effective, and so they do whatever works best, but if they had a choice they would simply be balanced PvE and PvP healers with a niche to call their own. Raising the mana costs doesn't change anything; worst case it delays bubble spam until next tier when we'll have to revisit the issue yet again. Disc has a mastery DEVOTED to shields. 1/3 of the talent tree is DEVOTED to shields. Find a better solution, this is just absurd. EJ and the wow forums are full of suggestions that limit shield spam (which is really only a problem in 25m on certain fights at certain, HIGH gear levels). PvP priests hurt for mana more than any other healer currently, and this is going to make it worse in exchange for DELAYING a problem until next tier. <br />
<br />
What's worse is that Disc could really be a unique, but balanced, healing class in PvP and PvE. Having a mastery devoted to essentially a single spell and then saying you should only be using that spell for emergencies is the type of thinking that prevents it from ever coming into its own.<br />
<br />
Completely agree. If only there were more people like you, and less &quot;OMG IM FLASH HEALING AND IT HURTS MY BLUE BAR&quot; baddies on these forums, Blizzard may look at what's being suggested by fellow Priests and come up with an alternative nerf.</div></div><hr />

Considering Prayer of Healing was nerfed for bothing healing specs, discipline is completely lackluster. You can't afford to pre-shield raid damage anymore, so you're stuck with weak prayer of healing spam to attempt to keep people alive from 100k+ Incineration, Lava Spew, and much more. I'd be fine with this change if they made our other spells attractive with discipline, but considering discipline spends 14 talent points that solely benefit one spell, there's no justification in their actions for this. But they did nothing to balance out this change. And siince we can't afford to shield, we're back to being just brought for power word: barrier.<br />
<br />
Also shielding isn't healing, anyone even remotely comparing the two is dumb.<br />
If someone's at 30% hp and they're healed, they gain a % of their health.<br />
If someone's at 30% hp and shielded with no heals, well then, they didn't gain any health back.<br />
<br />
You can't have just shielding, and the thing is, shields are powerful because everything else is lackluster.<br />

To be honest, you might be doing something wrong. I'm actively looking for ways to blow through mana more as over the course of a 10 minute boss fight, I have about 170K mana unused (taking into account regen procs). I'm actually finding that my normal pws, penance, renew, if+greater heal is so mana efficient that I'm looking for ways to creatively burst up some of my heals at the expense of heals per mana just to use more of my resources.</div></div><hr />

I used it in raids but it never felt significant to me. 6 seconds of situational damage reduction. Blah. I miss when we could use Raid wall or spec into it. Move that up the prot tree and we are in business. It would be nice especially for 10 man groups who don't have a prot pally and can still give the addition to this wonderful ability.<br />

<br />
Napkin math tells me that this will make Shaman single target heals roughly on par with the other healers right now (yes, they were that far behind coefficent-wise), and now Shaman will still have the weakness of dealing with a spread out raid/ movement, but make up for it by being completely superior at healing clumps of people, with good spot healing when clumps aren't there. Kinda like now except with the HPS being way better to make up for the current weaknesses. It's not exactly the niche I expected but it will be quite a viable one vs now.<br />
<br />
I'm kinda interested to see where they go with the CDs. I have no idea what they will do for Druid, but I would like to see them rework what Shaman already has to make them better: the unimplemented Spirit Link, a revamped Spiritwalker's Grace (make it give charges instead of time), and a revamped Nature's Swiftness should all be pretty good instead of making completely new spells out of left field. With Shaman and Druid both having viable cooldowns and similar HPS values to Paladins and Priests people might actually be able to start going into a raid with only their skill holding them back. It's been a rocky few months for my Shaman and Drood but it will be interesting to see. <br />
<br />

I can find you parses where they are 1-2 no problem with almost only using shields. I'm glad you think my statement has anything to do with the priest change.

Prayer of Healing sucks.<br />
Power Word: Barrier is still a great CD, but everything else is lack luster.<br />

I'd be fine with the changes if they added something to compensate with the mana cost increase. They went the wrong way around fixing this. I would've preferred how it was pre-4.0.6 for shields than this upcoming change. At least it was usable to pre-shield before raid damage so I could then top people off with Prayer of Healing.<br />

And the bubble mana cost isn't FIXING anything, it's just pushing the problem off until the next tier when we have the mana to spam it again and they'll have to raise the cost again. If the problem is being too good at aoe blanketing then put an aoe cap on them. It'd make us have to worry just a bit more about where our shields are sitting and what would happen if we put up a new one.<br />
Or even lowering the duration. Set it to 15 or 20 seconds so it can't continuously absorb raid damage for half a minute. Maybe even drop it down to DA duration so it'd be essentially casting a prayer of healing(duration-wise, not with regards to effective healing).<br />
In the end, all they're doing is persuading us to not use our best heal. Mastery is an amazing stat for disc, and whereas it only affects DA when we crit, it effects pws 100% of the time. I won't disagree it should be nerfed...but go about it the right way.</div></div><hr />

Tranquility is all fine and dandy, but you can only use it once a fight because the cooldown is so long. We also have Nature's Swiftness, and that's only if you spec into it, and only used as an &quot;oh crap&quot; button like an instant battle rez or getting a nuke heal off. Resto druids have nothing to prevent damage, (like shields, Guardian spirit keeping the tank from dying, disc priest PW: Barrier etc.) we can only respond to damage after it's been taken. This problem has needed to be addressed for a long time now, glad they are finally looking into it. Just sucks that we have to wait until 4.1 to come out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That will be absolutely massive, at least 2k HPS, maybe even more in some cases.<br />

In other words bringing us up there together with all the other classes. Great to feel that Blizzard is actually monitoring PvE balance.</div></div><hr />

The shaman buff and Power Word: Shield adjustment above should bring all healers reasonably close in terms of throughput. The decision on who to bring then might end up being dictated by the strong cooldowns offered by paladins or priests. This isn’t the kind of thing we can address via a hotfix, but it is something we are looking at for the next major content patch.<br />
<br />
As always, we appreciate your continued constructive feedback and will do our best to keep you informed of ongoing developments.<br />

I started playing my Resto Shaman hardly two weeks ago, haven't played since downing the Lich King in Wrath.. Prior to Cata I used to be a pretty badass healer, raided in top 200 guilds, not the best but quite comfortable with the class to say the least.. In Cata I was feeling shitty about my healing, everyone pulling at least 2k HPS more then myself.. After looking at top parses I noticed that an average player of other classes are pullig the same amount, if not more, HPS then the #1 recorded healing parses of Shaman. That made me feel a bit better, I'm quite happy to hear it isn't just me, that it's getting fixed, and that I didn't have to suffer as long as some of the Shaman who've played since Cata began.<br />
<br />
EDIT: And I'm extremely excited to see what they decide upon in terms of an additional cooldown for us.</div></div><hr />

FLASH HEAL, it currently costs over 5k mana, and casts in around 1.3sec with around 600 haste or something more.<br />
What else can we cast? Penance, ok, that costs shit loads of mana, has a long cd timer on it, and is usually never ready for use when its really needed, also, it sucks as if the tank really needs healing, and that fast, Penance only gets in 1 heal (3k - 5k health), and sap, the tank is dead.<br />
So, now we have 1 more healing spell, what is that? oh, that is called Heal, it costs over 2k - 3k mana, and cast time is 2.3sec with over 1000 haste. Now, this is really not a valid healing spell, as it only heals for less then 7k health, witch sounds awesome at first, until you step into a dungeon for the first time and find yourself going oom after every single group pull because people just simply cannot believe that Crowd Control is actually something GOOD TO USE!<br />
<br />
Blizzard, if you really want to make things hard and still have people play discipline, see to it that you fucking change some of the cast times on the spells, and halven all the mana costs. It is not playable the way you are fucking your players right now!<br />
<br />
I dunno much about disc priests. But i do know my guild (25m raiding guild) used to have 2 disc priests, who were really dedicated. One only plays his alt now, the other switched to holy and has said many times he really isnt enjoying it and is considering his alt switched to MS for DKP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The healing was brutal, but do-able. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit for a while. But to be honest, it got old fast. I have had one foot out the door since about a week in to this expansion. The Priest nerfs are just about gonna do it for me.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I got involved in a project to build a Soul/Talent calculator for Ri... another MMO, and started playing the beta. Our whole guild is moving. Yes, we will probably be back, and maybe by that time WoW will seem fresher and fun again.<br />
<br />
And no, I am not a Wrath Baby. I healed all the way back to the start. PW on 40 was at least as hard as anything we have now, so its not that the game is too hard. It just... kinda sucks now.</div></div><hr />

I also remember our resto shaman saying at a point during yesterday's raid that her heals were healing for way more out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
Some people on AJ actually say the nerf has been in game 2 days ago already.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to track how much mana my shields costed tonight on WoL ?<br />
<br />
Reason is ask is that if that nerf was already on, then I was still happily spamming shields for 75% of my healing done on HC.Maloriak without really noticing the extra mana cost and therefore, it still doesn't prevent you to shield spam.</div></div><hr />

this, post patch ive had to reserve my mana so much more, it's not hard but we're now by far the least effiecient burst healers and raidhealers. i went from having a stable 10k hps to being forced to 8-9k to conserve mana, while disc priest in my 10man guild is going at 12k stable hps with shields and 19k hps bursting. Druid healer also is at height with me now and he's 6itemlevels behind. Nothing in our raids dies due to lack of healing but it looks like paladins are being replaced by druids and priests, with the change to shamans will we be the &quot;pure&quot; tank healer again?

Part of the reason why people say HPS doesn't tell the whole story is because of several CDs not being able to be measured by a HPS meter (and even now I don't see much of a discrepancy). Holy Pally just happens to have a ton of CDs, more than any healer by far. I'm not going to go on and on about HPally since it's not my main and I still haven't raided with him a ton, but I've raided alongside Holy Pallys for years and their CDs are still pretty amazing and will continue to be. I don't see anything to worry about, tbh.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc03779e49a8</div><div class="date">2011-02-17, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh. You're so wrong, let me count the ways:<br />
<br />
Divine Favor<br />
Holy Radiance<br />
Light of Dawn <br />
Word of Glory<br />
Holy Shock <br />
Hand of Sacrifice<br />
Aura Mastery<br />
Avenging Wrath<br />
Guardian of Ancient Kings<br />
Judgement<br />
<br />
Then there are the self cooldowns like:<br />
Divine Shield<br />
Divine Protection<br />
(here's a hint you should be using those bubbles during the times you expect to take a lot of damage).<br />
<br />
All I do during a fight is cooldown managment, and with Beacon and Protector of the Innocent all of my heals are &quot;aoe&quot; like. <br />
<br />
I play a holy Paly and if not before, I expect at Tier 2 raiding we will see a nerf, probably to Meditation or higher mana costs.<br />
<br />
What an amazing list of Pally cooldowns... lol<br />
Let's see...<br />
<br />
Divine Favor - yes, this could be count as a cooldown, since it help to heal more, but does not prevent any damage<br />
Holy Radiance - oh, I thought it's part of our ordinary healing spell repertoire? And hey, it ticks for about 10k each second with no restrictions in range or number of healed persons -.-<br />
Light of Dawn - Oh well, another standard heal... and you'll never need to position right to heal every person instantly for about... 5k each? wow...<br />
Word of Glory - Yes, this is a really big healing cooldown... lol<br />
Holy Shock - lol... just lol<br />
Hand of Sacrifice - this one... yes it's quite good, with the talent at a 1.5min CD, so you could use it very often... because you will never die due to the redirected damage when used to save a tank's life, while he get big hits... but yes, sometimes it's really good, but sometimes it just can't be used due to the redirected damage<br />
Aura Mastery - Quite good, even though it lasts only 6 seconds<br />
Avenging Wrath - same as DF<br />
Guardian of Ancient Kings - It's not really as good as it sounds... 5min CD for only 5 doubled heals with some AE-splash? CD too much to long and duration too short<br />
Judgement - again... just lol<br />
Lay on Hands (not listed by you?) - Strong CD, very good, with some restrictions (no chain-loh since it's cause forbearance, no transfer through beacon, no crits, high cd)<br />
<br />
So yes, we do have some quite nice cooldowns, but not as much as you want others to think. But then again, what do we NOT have, what EVERY other class has? A nice AE-healing spell, we do not have something like chainheal, poh, wg, we do not have any hot (hence you glyph WoG which is something stupid to do :D). Yes, we have LoD and HR, but both are not able to save someone while a big AE-damage is incoming, like Nezir's ultimate at TfW or Magmatron's fire-ae or while Chimaeron's feud-phase or when Maloriak casts his flamebreath or at Nefarian's crackle and so on.<br />
<br />
At the end, yes the buffs are needed, especially for resto shamans. And yes they need good healing cooldowns. But don't say, pallys are so incredible OP and have tons of wonderful cooldowns. We have some, some are very situational (i.e. no use for AM for nature-damage, yeah -.-), some are quite strong (LoH). But also we have a big lack of healing multiple targets and not only supporting the &quot;real&quot; group-healers.</div></div><hr />

Screwing up healing priests by increasing the shield cost? If you wanna shield spam i guess it's bad, but it sounds boring as hell to me... I agree with the change... The ICC style of Disc is gone. if you want that back you might want to reroll...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Desolator</div><div class="date">2011-02-17, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still think they should have just given PW:S a 3-4 second cooldown or something.<br />
Na that would be totally unfair to Disc priests as they cannot pre sheild everyone in dire situations or where you are expecting big AoE damage like from Magmatron in the Omnitron Defence System. The increase mana cost gives you something to think about, either to use up your mana and save the raid or use your healings spells like prayer of healing if you think you can manage it. Or even using PI on yourself and preshielding all the raid in order to save mana and do your task.<br />
<br />
Increasing the mana cost is actually helping you to use other spells that the tree offers. Yes, Mastery does benefit directly to PW: Sheilds but then again there is Divine Aegis as well which you get from normal healing spells.</div></div><hr />

I'm glad that they actually do get the buff - It's something they desperately need, considering they have been behind other Healing classes since the start of Cataclysm.<br />

&quot;I'm in a top guild on my realm, and the 3 resto shamans are kicking out 18/20k hps&quot;=Lie <br />
<br />
go to worldoflogs, normal 10m, see HPS rankings, let us say Halfus<br />
there is no single resto shammy in top 100 hps, I wish I could see at least 1 resto shaman in world of logs top 100 hps<br />
but you wont see many until about 700....<br />
now apply filter by resto shaman, the top one kicks out omg omg omg 15k hps. <br />
<br />
oh wait a second...<br />
go to worldoflogs, heroic 10m, see HPS rankings<br />
...why there are only priests that top the HM meter?<br />
now apply filter by resto shaman, the top one kicks out omg omg omg ....... 15k hps. <br />
<br />
These &quot;particularly aggressive (priest) healers&quot; should note that healing is not mindless HPS racing but teamwork, but yeah their sweet life will be spoiled now, unless they l2p in team and change their mindset<br />
and how the hell did you manage to fall behind your 3 resto shamans? learning how to heal issue or what?<br />

<br />
Now as far as the buffs everyone who thinks shamans dont need this buff check the compiled wol logs on stateofdps.com. If you are top healing on your shaman it is because your other healers are not maximizing their throughput. <br />
<br />
Mana tide WAS\IS a powerful cd but mana users cant complain anymore because its effect is now raid wide..so all healers really benefit equally. <br />

Resto Shaman in Paragon (and the other bleeding edge Guilds) were there only as mana battery (Mana Tide Totem) bots. <br />
The only reason people let resto shamans into raids was purely a human factor, and we need to thank our friends as they let us raid in our crippled state.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because 99% of WoW raids at that level.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, people's gear and skill level play much more of a role than class limitations. I would say my guild is about average, we're not hardcore 5 nights a week but at the same time we're not casual. We have two 10 mans. One has a holy priest and a pally as heals and they struggle and struggle on fights. The other team has a resto shammy and druid as heals. Now, a lot of things can factor into this, like group 1 having fewer competent DPS, but I know from speaking with people in group 1 that the heals are the primary problem. Meanwhile group 2 is about to start hard modes. Again, we're hardly Paragon, but that's just my point--the vast majority of guilds are not raiding at the bleeding edge level where class comp matters because everyone is at the top of their game. If you're an excellent resto shaman, your friends will want to bring you over a holy priest that doesn't know wtf they're doing and has stam gems. Knowing your class has infinitely more effect on this than the minutiae of class limitations that only really become apparent in bleeding edge content.<br />
<br />
That's not to say that resto shamans don't need love (they do), I'm just sick and damn tired of hearing bad players blame their failure on limitations of class design, pointing to guilds they would never get past the app process for as proof of why their class is broken and needs buffs. It's not just healers, you see DPS pulling this crap all the time too. Some melee DPS in a guild that can't down the Baradin Hold boss without wiping 10 times crying on the forums about how his/her class needs buffs or X class needs nerfs because Paragon is stacking ranged on some heroic encounter they will never see outside of YouTube. For extra fail they link stateofdps in their QQ post. Makes me want to punt gnomes into woodchippers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pre-hotfix on our Nefarian attempts (10m) our shaman was keeping about equal with our holy paladin in terms of raw HPS, with me staying a bit ahead of both of them on my Druid.<br />
<br />
Post-hotfix he was absolutely blowing us out of the water, pulling 11k+ HPS on every pull.<br />

<br />
Roll Telluric currents then, or something..<br />
<br />
I haven't had a mana problem since I healed my first heroic in Cataclysm.. That being said, if you're talking about a fight like.. Magmaw heroic 25 man, then maybeeeee~<br />
<br />
The +hps buff we just got was exactly what we needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for this, and for going to world of logs and demonstrating the person is lying. I can't believe that STILL, after blizzard finally acknowledged Shamans had been far behind the other healing classes, we get people in here telling stupid, false anecdotes.</div></div><hr />

For instance ret paladins could get a shorter CD on Crusader strike, Disc Priests could get a cap on how many shields can be active at a time, Resto druids Nourish could heal 10% more per hot on the target (from what it's now) and so on. I pretty sure all the &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;underpowered&quot; specs will be one of the better once haste scaling kicks in in later raids, question remains. Will blizzard fix some specs before that time?<br />
<br />
just for fun i checked Retri dps on world of logs. best dps in 25man halfus HC was at 600something place and he was alone among the ret paladins at 69k dps. top dps was a fire mage at 130k dps followed by another fire mage dps at 110k. I do realize that fire mages do well on this fight and i checked the first real comparable to retpaladins and they were all at 90k-ish. MM hunters im talking about. And yes i checked dps during and after the drakes died so no real AOE was blowing numbers.</div></div><hr />

We are still not even going to be the strongest HPS class.<br />
<br />
Either you are in a guild where your shaman is purely raid healing and spamming everything he got and the other classes are either bad geared, or playing incorrect. Correctly the shamans HPS were on average about 15-20% below the other classes (in overall, not in specific cases, im sure some guilds might have resto shamans as top healers, but in 95% of the guilds that are good (atleast cleared normal and trying to progress trough hc content they were far behind, even after 3.0.6).<br />
<br />
Mana wise, shamans are about equal to the other healers, a bit worse ofcourse because our HPS was lacking so we needed to use more mana to keep up with intense fights. Hopefully this will be fixed now.<br />
<br />
Just listen to the people that posted the logs from top guilds, that PROVE that shamans, the really good shamans were way behind the good priests and paladins in equal gear. This is a fact.<br />
<br />
Question we all shamans wonder about:<br />
<br />
Has this gone live, or when is it going to go live? Would be great if someone could answer this, have looke trough the forums and checked around on my server but havent been able to get any real answer to this. Most say the changes have gone live (those who are non shamans) because some priests are noticing more mana used on shields. Some shamans are reporting GHW healing for more, im not one of them thought. Im 95% sure my healing is the same as a few days ago, my riptide always healed for around 1700 ticks, it now heals for 1750 now, my healing wave still for low average of 7100 on targets beside myself with no earthshield buff, and without any totem or other buff at all.<br />
<br />
But i could be wrong ofcourse, anyone noticed difference yet?</div></div><hr />

Mana was never a problem, if played right. No offence but its the other healer's failing issue, it is not shaman being OP. Look into what goes terribly wrong with their healing.<br />
Being paired with 2 other good healers of any class was absolutely terrible from shaman POV, it was felt like you've been carried; they have been kicking out 20% more then you on average. However being paired with 2 other terribad healers of any class was not any better by obvious reasons; and overtopping the heal meter was a very poor consolation :)<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, back on planet Earth, people's gear and skill level play much more of a role than class limitations. <br />
To put it simple, bringing a shaman into raid was equal to bringing any other healer in greens/ 333 blues<br />
Ofc skill matters and some people can down the bosses in greens and there are numeriouss examples and achievements of this sort<br />
But back to earth, if it was enough to go through normal content with a help of good buddies, it was fricking far from being enough in heroic.<br />

<br />
^So much this. If you are in any decent sort of guild there is more than likely 2 decent non shaman healers who simply make you feel like you are being carried.<br />
<br />
Many people are not in those &quot;bleeding edge&quot; guilds but it does give light that at the pinnacle of gameplay , a problem exists where poor skill is not a factor.</div></div><hr />

Shammy healers were never #1 till a week before cata then we dropped to the bottom. The only thing we were good for was heroism, which more people have now, and totems. When we can throw our biggest heal and barely see the tanks health bar move, or when we can go oom on trash, we need a buff.</div></div><hr />

I think people have been to critical on resto shamans and just had to get used of it because they did change alot since wotlk :3 Anyway i quess we can enjoy until the patch after this one ^^</div></div><hr />
