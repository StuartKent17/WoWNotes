Would be nice for them to put this in for free - not that I'd deny them the option to put in paid stuff, but it'd raise the public opinion, plus I don't think many people would use this if it cost money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This very much leads me to believe that this is either a mistake, or that it's a free trial period like they did with the mobile guild chat. It will likely be bundled in with the mobile services, making them an even better value than they already were. <br />
<br />
The debate about whether this should be free or not has been covered endlessly and I don't think anyone is going to change their mind on that at this point, so there is no reason to go over it again.</div></div><hr />

Paid transfers arent only to play with friends, just like back in the day when your server was &quot;Full&quot; you'd have to pay just to x-fer off and actually play the game, plenty of reason to X-fer off other than &quot;Playing with friends&quot; such as, Over pop server,server youre on has hardly any progressiveness,you mistakenly started playing this game on a pvp server and you hate being ganked. Theres many more that i may have missed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was nowhere near as big an issue with the community as RealID was. Not even remotely close. It essentially boiled down to a debate over the micro-transaction model, which some people hate with every fiber of their being. <br />
<br />
RealID was a far more serious issue. Don't fool yourself into thinking that the forum outcry was what caused them to back off. It was the numerous legal challenges that would have resulted had they implemented it, because while it may not have broken any privacy laws (I'm not a lawyer so couldn't say either way) it probably bent the hell out of a few of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole point of the subscription fee is to cover developments like this, it's why the LFD system doesn't cost money. Because back in it's inception, Blizzard didn't charge monthly fees for new features.</div></div><hr />

Not even remotely close. It essentially boiled down to a debate over the micro-transaction model, which some people hate with every fiber of their being. <br />
<br />
RealID was a far more serious issue. Don't fool yourself into thinking that the forum outcry was what caused them to back off. It was the numerous legal challenges that would have resulted had they implemented it, because while it may not have broken any privacy laws (I'm not a lawyer so couldn't say either way) it probably bent the hell out of a few of them.<br />
<br />
You say that as if I didn't know it already. Just because I didn't mention the differences doesn't mean I didn't know them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You did not read what they said back when they posted about it. They said, and I'll bold, underline, and italicize this for you...<br />
&quot;Certain features of this service would have a premium charge to use&quot;<br />
So, until we get the list of WHAT does, they won't introduce an in-game feature like this that is 100% unusable without paying. THAT would be dumb. But given the amount of tech that went into allowing for cross-realm (and even outside of your Battle-group) Real-ID grouping, I don't imagine it was cheap to develop, or quick for that matter, either.<br />
<br />
Hell, for all we know, until Blizz says something about this info, they may have dropped the premium service charge part of it entirely.</div></div><hr />

? Their sub fees have been the same since day 1? and the cost of the game has been the same whenever a new expansion comes out. All the extra things that you say they are &quot;trying to squeeze pennies out of you&quot; ARE optional. And yes a shame that you follow the news and feel the need to post here? o_O?

Theres many more that i may have missed.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, you can't do raids with this feature. Nor can you do anything in the world together (like quests ect). Its purely for LFD. There are still plenty of reasons for using paid transfer. I'm not naive enough to think it won't lower the amount of people using paid transfer, but it isn't going to make it obsolete, like a lot of people seem to be arguing in defence of this being a premium feature. <br />
<br />
I also doubt this feature costs Blizzard any additional money in order to run, since you are effectively just using LFD, which already lets you group with people on other servers other than your own. The only difference is, now you'll be able to invite someone off another realm before hand if they are on your realid.<br />
<br />
Ah well, this has been debated to death. Its not like Blizzard will change their stance on it, especially since this might be along the lines of a &quot;trial&quot; in order to get people hooked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the ...??? People don't just transfer only because some friends are on another realm... They mostly transfer because their server sucks, they wanna join specific guild or something like that. <br />
And btw, you'll still won't be able to do quests with your friends so yeah, people would still transfer regardless of this feature.<br />
And btw, in case you haven't noticed but there are so many servers and most people have friends on more than 1 other server. I for example have friends on 5 different servers including the server I am on. So I'd have to transfer to 4 different servers and also stay on the server I am on already or just leave my friends on my server behind just to play with some other friends. No way I'm gonna do that. Would you?</div></div><hr />

What is Real ID Party and how do I invite my friends to groups? <br />
<br />
Real ID Party is a brand new addition with Patch 4.2. With Real ID Party, you can invite any Real ID Friends to a party, and queue for a group using the Dungeon Finder feature. This means you can group with others regardless of their realm. Please note, they must be within your region (US, EU, Etc.) in order to be invited. If they can create a character on your realm, they are eligible for your group!<br />
<br />
Please note: Real ID Party is only usable with Real ID friends. More information regarding Real ID can be found on the Battle.net Website: Battle dot net/realid/.<br />
<br />
In order to invite someone from another realm using Real ID Party, simply open your friends list. At the top of the list are your Real ID friends. Next to their name will be a simple &quot;Plus&quot; sign that you can click, and this will invite them. If they are eligible to queue with you, you can then sign up for a Dungeon Finder group.<br />
<br />
Any further information on Real ID Party may be found on the World of Warcraft Community site: battle dot net/wow</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if you're serious. Act-Blizzard could run WoW completely free and still easily fund development, support and the servers for many years without hitting the red - purely from WoW profits. I'm not advocating they do that; but to imply they need to implement this feature as a premium one to stay afloat is just utterly insane.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just made this comment on the official forums, but arent you playing with most of your friends anyway? There is probably a reason beyond the pve/pvp/rp server type as to why you picked the server youre on....<br />
<br />
I certainly did.... and paid for it while leveling (may I suggest you're first real MMO toon not be leveled on a PVP server... just saying).... Playing with the friends who recruited me to the game more then made up for that pain though. If you don't like this, do not pay for it. If enough people do that and mention the reason on the offical forums, then I suspect that this may become part of the normal interface.<br />

Imagine WoW server as 1 phase of WoW world of Azeroth. If there are 30 different server, there would be 30 prime phases and player would be able to talk even across phases with &quot;game friends&quot; on some different server. Instances/ dungeons would be in some way &quot;a meeting place&quot; for cross server/phase friends. <br />
<br />
After you' have become friends you could play with them even in normal WoW zones and player could anytime see where his/her friends are. &quot;Friends&quot; would actually &quot;share&quot; their &quot;prime phase&quot; aka game world.</div></div><hr />

(but if you do care about that charity and want some sort of Blizzard pet, go for it (even though thats just buying a thing from Blizzard and not actually donating to charity in the first place)) Does all the income from the Charity pets even go to Charity? knowing how money grubbing Blizzard is, I really really doubt it. I'd guess 60% goes to charity. Fanboys are the root of all evil, fanboys are really why it still costs an insane amount of money for a fully automated process that needs no human interaction to transfer a character or race change or whatever. That service has already paid for itself a billion fold. Don't be stupid.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I'm consistently shocked by how much abuse fanboys will put up with. It's kind of sad, actually, given that they're being blatantly used by the very company they love so blindly.<br />
<br />
I suppose much of it comes from their lack of knowledge of the development process, and just how little time it really takes to create recycled content or features like this cross-realm RealID (nearly the entirety of the back-end coding/&quot;tech&quot; for this feature has been in-game since patch 3.2, which in turn was based largely on coding/tech they'd done back in Vanilla for BG's - so much of the work for this has been done since Vanilla).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And even if it was timeconsuming, no argument can ever defend a premium feature within a pay to play game.<br />
<br />
We'll see how it works out. I've written so many posts about this on various forums (being strongly against any premium or micro transactions within a pay to play game), and I'm drained, there's been no official reply except some political blahblah that essentially stated exactly what we all fear.</div></div><hr />

It has been possible to end up with people from other realms in your dungeons for a long time, and even requeing to a new dungeon with those individuals. Blizzard basically added the functionality to invite people cross-realm. And this is even limited to your RealID friends.<br />
<br />
But I am actually a little excited to see how this whole Premium ordeal will turn out. I could see them giving a set amount of server transfers and recustomizations per month or something to any subscribers. And while I see your point, LOLMUSTACHE, you must remember that not all the realm transfers are going as planned - and fixing any mistakes or having support to deal with issues related to the service is costly. Making the service free would really hurt many realms, as players would swoop around at random and leave &quot;ghost town&quot; realms behind for good. Giving a set amount of transfers per month would also lead to some players feeling they *have* to use the feature and seek even greener grass on other realms. While slightly exaggerating, I feel having a slight cost to these services makes players think twice before they start moving around. But I could totally see Blizzard adding a &quot;Move Guild&quot; feature that would give players of e.g. a certain guild reputation level the ability to transfer freely for that *one* payment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paid transfers costing as much as they do was a mistake in the first place. I know they want to &quot;upsell&quot; their existing customers, but playing with your friends in an MMO is the only reason you keep playing an MMO. Connecting you with friends is what retain subscribers long term.<br />
<br />
After most of my guild got banned for botting (dumbasses) I still had friends on at least 4 other realms I would have gladly joined up with to keep playing. But the hell if I'm paying more money for them to deign to let me keep playing their game. I canceled and spent the $55+ on other companies' games instead, and get to keep my $15/month too. If Blizzard had let me play with those other friends I'm certain I would have gotten sucked back into raiding and leveling alts instead of quitting.<br />
<br />
In short: retaining subscribers &gt; upselling subscribers. That's why playing with friends should be free.</div></div><hr />
