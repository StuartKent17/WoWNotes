We don't really know a lot more about these fights as they are not yet available on PTRs, but it looks like the last 3 will be fun according to the achievements (http://db.mmo-champion.com/achievements/14921?id__gte=2500#) ...<br />

Defeast the Black Knight in 10 minutes while wearing all blue items, before 3 Volcanos erupt, while everyone in the group has at least 1 stack of Spurting Blood and there are no shamans or paladins in the party but before you spend at least 1000 gold in repairs wiping to the Black Knight&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#13;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;<br />

The Argent Confessor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3802/argent-confessor/) achievement for the fight against Argent Confessor Paletress (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/34928/argent-confessor-paletress/) is probably the most interesting one. According to some datamining I did on the creatures (http://db.mmo-champion.com/search/creature/memory%20of/) it seems that this encounter will let you experience previous fights with bosses from past dungeons/expansions. <br />

Even if the instance seems to be fairly small, you will find 8 different bosses here according to the Call of the Grand Crusade (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3812/call-of-the-grand-crusade-25-player/) achievement. Please note that Fjola Lightbane and Eydis Darkbane are probably part of the same encounter. (See Double Time (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3815/double-time-25-player/))<br />

The last boss is currently named &quot;Final Boss&quot; in the achievement but this isn't going to stop us right? Achievements usually point to the ID of the creature you're supposed to kill and this final boss points to the ID of ....<br />
<br />
Anub'arak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/34660/anub-arak/)! <br />
Azjol-Nerub was merely a setback! The former nerubian king is back and hopefully players will be able to face him in a much more epic fight than what they experienced in the early 5-man instance. Even if he doesn't seem to have any model in the game files for the moment we can fairly assume that he will use the new Frost Cryptlord model added in 3.2.<br />

SK Gaming wins the Regionals of the Arena Tournament<br />
Slorkuz did a fantastic job and covered most of the tournament, make sure you check his posts:<br />
Regional Finals Coverage - Saturday (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/9520949811-regional-finals-coverage--saturday.html)<br />
Regional Finals Coverage - Sunday (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/9520949812-regional-finals-coverage--sunday.html)<br />
In the very last World of Warcraft match of the day, we find SK gaming set to face off against TSG for the title of US Regional Champions and a hefty slump of money. Without much fuss we find the first round underway in the Ring of Valor. TSG open the match by Death Gripping Realz into the thick of things but are unable to capitalise on the play as Realz gets some assitance from Pooks and escapes using Pain Suppression to stay alive. From there SK turn the tide of the battle in an instant as they force Zilea to bubble only to have it Mass Dispelled. While Zilea catches up on the healing, SK swaps target to Valrath and drop him in the matter of a full duration Kidney shot. SK gaming takes the first round of the Grand Finals.<br />
<br />
Minutes later the second match starts as we watch Veex charging into Pookz on the Nagrand Arena. Enforcer gets caught in a fear by Veex but trinkets it and gets straight onto Zilea. On SK Gaming's end, Realz is forced to use Pain suppression on Pookz after he already had used his IceBlock. TSG, not willing to let the pressure drop, stick to their target and manage to drop him fast as there is no IceBlock of Pain Suppression to save him from the hard hitting melee. TSG takes the round and equalises the score to 1-1.<br />
<br />
The third round is pretty much all one way as SK Gamign open on Zilea, throwing both Imp CounterSpells and Kidneyshots his way. Zilea in return trinkets the kidney shot in order to get away. The match goes on for a few as SK keep the pressure up and finally are able to drop Zilea with a combination of Mass Dispel on the bubble followed by a second Imp CS. At this point, Zilea is dangerously low and it is not a hard task for Enforcer to finish him off. SK takes the lead: 2-1.<br />
<br />
In the fourth round of the Grand Finals, we can see TSG charging into Enforcer in hopes to keep his stuns off their paladin. Despite Zilea using his bubble to heal himself to full, as soon as he pops back out into the match SK swaps target once again to him and pretty much blows him up in a matter of moments. SK Gaming wins the match 3-1, securing the title of US Regional Champions and 5000 dollers each.<br />
<br />
With that set of power plays, SK Gaming have proved their ability to the world by claiming the title of US Regional Champions. We look forward to seeing them defend their honor in the WorldWide Grand Finals at Blizzcon 2009.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to them, and thanks to everyone who came to the venue to make the event as memorable as it has been.<br />
<br />
With that; Over and Out from the event venue here in Cologne, Germany. <br />

And my third was, oh god, Blizz has finally brought back old bosses and tuned them to level 80 (even Hogger! Awesome humor), and people now QQ because... oh, they're old bosses. HEY WAIT A MINUTE I SEE WHAT U DID THAR.. no wait, no I don't.</div></div><hr />

Defeast the Black Knight in 10 minutes while wearing all blue items, before 3 Volcanos erupt, while everyone in the group has at least 1 stack of Spurting Blood and there are no shamans or paladins in the party but before you spend at least 1000 gold in repairs wiping to the Black Knight<br />

He will have a new model as of next PTR build, with no head. It will instead be replaced with a baby murloc in a Diablo costume doing the macarana.<br />

Holy shit. Are there no fights in this game you actually like? Because if there's not one you'd like to revisit while still being able to improve your character in the process- plus not having to do weird shit like not level past sixty- well, maybe you need to carefully analyze why you play this game, and what kind of emotions you really want it to invoke in you.<br />
<br />
It's not even like you just go and fight the bosses stand-alone. It sounds like they're just phases in this Inquisitor boss encounter, which I think is a fantastic idea.<br />
<br />
Look, I usually criticize nostalgia, but now they're just cherry-picking neat bosses, and allowing the whole fanbase to finally see them. Why don't you try to think about what other people might like? Not everything in this game has to be for you. (Or me- I, for example, fucking hated vanilla raiding as a whole, but I would not object to the creation of classic servers. I just wouldn't participate.)<br />
<br />
Besides, all you bleeding edge types shit on five man anyway, so it's not like you were going to be super hyper eager to see this particular wing anyway.</div></div><hr />

Why are we killing the champions of our own faction? Durh, because we aren't going to kill them, it's probably down to 1-2% and then they go friendly. Except for the Black Knight, we'll likely be killing him.</div></div><hr />

I anticipate parts of it will be pruned. I will be disappointed if others aren't added.<br />
<br />
Also, if they make it doable for everyone but pile on half a dozen increasingly absurd requirements, it should come with a title and an epic shirt. (An &quot;I killed the Dark Knight TWICE and all I got was this stupid t-shirt&quot; t-shirt.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the guy wondering why nobody is curious about the lore behind the other two- I think many people are curious, but there's just not enough info yet to bother discussing it much. Cultist defection sounds probable, though, or possibly Scarlet defection. Or maybe we'll kill them but they'll be rezzed afterward, this is the Argent Crusade, after all. Hella lotta Pallies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More likely, we fight them along with the rest of our faction's champions, given that they're labeled 'Champions of the Argent Crusade' hurhur. Like I said in my prev. post, it's more likely we'll get them very low, and they'll 'submit,' like in a duel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I wonder is how they're gonna make the fights unique. Anyway it's gonna be a long 5 man, 8 bosses in total. I expect that the champions on each side will 'mirror' one on the other side, so they've only got to design 5 boss encounters. <br />
<br />
But I can't even guess what those battles will be like.</div></div><hr />

Where's the logic in that ? Why would the Argent Crusade, who needs every viable soldier out there, allow Champions to get killed ? That, besides it not fitting in their philosophy.</div></div><hr />

He's the only Boss of the three which does not have an &quot;elite&quot; labeling to his tooltip (see Argent Confessor Paletress (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/34928/argent-confessor-paletress/) and Eadric the Pure (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/35119/eadric-the-pure/)).<br />
This and the related Achievement - which just yells &quot;Hello, I'm a placeholder!&quot; - lead me to think that we might see someone we know behind the Black Knight's mask... possibly another setback? ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, why would the new 5man have 8 bosses? I think it's pretty obvious that we will fight all of the champion together, MGT style.<br />
<br />
Again, reasons: The players have become Champions themselves now, haven't they? So the fight would much rather be 5 Champions versus 5 Champions and not 5v1, sounds fair to me, especially since it's an arena-style instance, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree - what it might be about is you fighting the champions of your own faction so your characters can become the 'new' champions (at least until tomorrow). Like a prize-fight boxing match. Though I have to point out, remembering how much fun the TBC bosses that were essentially super-powered versions of actual classes were to fight, I think this'll be a pretty sweet instance, if nothing else. The Magister's Terrace fight that essentially worked like a 5v5 arena match especially comes to mind.</div></div><hr />

As the Black Knight is controlled by Arthas, adn Mal'ganis... really... REALLY hates Arthas, to the point that we may even be working with him in some fashion to defeat Arthas in Icecrown, I somehow doubt that one. It'd be a real lolwut situation though.</div></div><hr />

Are there no fights in this game you actually like? Because if there's not one you'd like to revisit while still being able to improve your character in the process- plus not having to do weird shit like not level past sixty- well, maybe you need to carefully analyze why you play this game, and what kind of emotions you really want it to invoke in you.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I play this game, for exciting and new material to progress through, to be greeted with better looking artwork, more all encompassing dungeons. I don't play this game for blizzard to go:<br />
<br />
Ctrl+C<br />
Ctrl+V<br />
<br />
and then up their level by (x). I did these fights when I was the level to do them, I leveled to 80 to do NEW bosses in NEW dungeons. I go back to AQ40, MC and BWL every week for Rep. I then go raid ULDUAR for my new gear.<br />
<br />
I love how many people seem to think it's ok for a company making SO much goddamn money to just rehash content over and over again, and give us something new once per year. People like you are what is wrong with WoW now, you'll eat up anything and everything blizzard throws at you, because they are perfect and can do no wrong to your wonderful WoW.<br />
<br />
What would you say if Tier 9,10,11,12 and 13 were just all the same but recolored?<br />
What about if Icecrown had Freya, Hodir, Yogg-Saron and Mimiron, and then the next instance had FL, Thorim and Kel'Thuzad?</div></div><hr />

God forbid Blizzard actually listen to the (likely over a thousand by now, if not way more) threads started EVERY SINGLE DAY begging, BEGGING for level-80 reworkings of vanilla and TBC content.<br />
It's an awesome and sane way for Blizzard to actually respond to such requests without having to go back into Old Azeroth and retweak hundreds and hundreds of fights.</div></div><hr />

Although I agree with you and doubt that it'll be Mal'ganis, he might have been killed by Arthas and resurrected so that he now serves him. But I doubt that since the player's would hopefully see such a plot development one way or the other...</div></div><hr />

I think this is the most obvious hint that the achievement is a joke, referring to the Black Knight from Monty Python again, who couldn't possibly beat Arthur.<br />
Another possibility: you will be controlling some npc in a special system<br />
Or it's just true and I'll go kill whoever at Blizzard decided to exclude paladins. (not, HoT on SS doesn't make up for it.)</div></div><hr />

Look, we know you can't please everybody. But there are actually ppl out there CRYING and petitioning for lv 60 nostalgia servers. People have asked to adjust old Instances like BRD to lv 80 heroics.

All we know from the quests and ingame information is that the Black Knight is a mysterious figure who 'seems' to be part of the Cult of the Damned, Kel'thuzads fanclub.<br />
And do not forget that other dreadlord that lived for years under the Lich King's nose (http://www.wowwiki.com/Balnazzar).</div></div><hr />

I actually did. But why do these events make it impossible that Arthas has killed him by now? :/<br />
Yes, Mal'ganis did flee back to his homeworld but he still wanted revenge on Arthas so he might be back again already...<br />

How am I being a &quot;baby&quot; when i'm expecting my money to go to interesting and new content. You know how hard it is for blizzard to just tweak these mobs level and damage output?....well I take that back, because I would hate to even see the coding behind WoW at this point, so it probably is amazingly hard lol.<br />
<br />
It's fine to give people something like this, but just toss it out between new content patches, because it wouldnt be too hard for them to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
There's just a few of the old school Blizzard team left. When they realized what a success World of Warcraft had became (and the millions of player to show for), they couldn't keep up with the initial quality of quests, the extensive work with class balance, itemization and so on and so forth. What happened was that they replaced the guys that had pride in their work with people who came up with the Rank 14 time sink, 100 badges for a gem, 30k honor for a trinket, releasing raid instance that had never been tested etc.<br />
<br />
That's why every big patch .1/.2/.3 etc introduces such big class difference. It's confusing for the player base, but that's what happens when every third month a new guy steps up and want his idea patched in.</div></div><hr />

ONE boss gives you the chance to experience..what? Over 10 classic bosses in a hommage without having to travel all over Azeroth to faceroll them as a lv 80 or having to roll an alt and find a group for them.<br />

So who is the source of that quote? It is just a statement, no proof for nothing. IMHO new and fresh designers were brought in for LK and came up with the vehicle system that now has a love/hate relationship with many ppl.<br />
<br />
Rank 14 is so way back, it isn't even true. The team has changed so much. Remember when every nerd hated Kalgan? Now every nerd hates GC and want Kalgan back.<br />
<br />
If before rank 14 was the good ole times and you think the designers who brought us MC and BWL were &quot;better&quot; than the ones who made SSC, TK, BT, SWP or now Ulduar, then infact &quot;thelordymir &quot; discussions with you have to stop right now. You don't argument at all ^^</div></div><hr />

Haha, exactly...or talk about a gazillion Pokemon editions or Streetfighter or whatever beat 'em ups (do I have to mention 1st person shooters?)^^<br />

Seriously...they build a colliseum and put mobs in it. Granted, that thing looks a bit small from the outside...if you watch Gladiator you can't help getting a shiver down the spine and think how awesome fights in a big amphitheatre could be. Chariot races in Ben Hur, many possibilities.<br />
<br />
Maybe 3.2 and 3.1 complement each other. Maybe the fights in 3.2 are a &quot;quick&quot; snack...(which I doubt) but you still have all of Ulduar to clear every week and by the looks of it, only the minority of people have actually even killed the Keepers, let alone Yogg on 25 or 10 man...</div></div><hr />

In fact, YOU are the one ruining WoW, I'm sure if you and the people you consider &quot;non-wrong&quot; (made up word) all canceled their WoW subscriptions, Blizzard would maybe try and improve these types of things to regain the numbers they lost.<br />

On the bright side, I could level a new character and not have to worry about gearing him before attempting the achievement!<br />
<br />
I, too had to register just to comment on this bit of news. If this latest news update is not malarkey, I'm stoked! I hate to question Bouboullie, as his news reporting and fact finding efforts are nearly as revered to me as the game itself, but doggonnit, this latest bit about the memory mechanic and the epic (ironically so anti-epic) Black Knight achievement seem too fun to be real!<br />
<br />
Has Blizzard finally given so many players what they have been calling for since they first left the tumultuous sanctuary of Elwynn Forest?!?</div></div><hr />

You get to kill(or wipe on) oldschool bosses, while you're doing it with a good reason, instead of: &quot;lulz gonna solo DM KEKE&quot;<br />
<br />
Besides, it's going to be fun to see the WOTLK crowd wipe on Delrissa, they have been pampered with &quot;Tank pull and AOE LOL&quot; Heroics, now they can fight a true challenging 5 man boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
What make you think they won't tune the bosses to still be &quot;tank&amp;spankaoelol&quot;. They said it's the way they wanna go now with WoW.<br />
<br />
Btw, how the hell I have memories from fights that I never did? LoL :) From that list, never did Algalon, SWP boss and vanilla raid bosses (except the MC guy).<br />
<br />
Omg, maybe those are her memories!!! :)<br />

So Blizzard gives an interseting twist to this with ONE (1) boss. Stopp being such a baby^^<br />
<br />
<br />
???<br />
<br />
Well, Blizz finally listened to the cries of the &quot;nostalgia lvl. 60 servers&quot;. <br />
<br />
With 3.2 patch you will be able to lock a char to lvl. 60 even with BC and LK expansion and experience old content &quot;the old way&quot;. <br />
<br />
What else do you want?<br />
<br />
A certain condition lock, which would only allow player to go to Outland (and Northrend) until all &quot;old game content&quot; is cleared and all quests related to instances done?</div></div><hr />

You are not the only person who plays wow. As stated before, several people have requested time, and time again for an old world server. This makes it obvious to Blizz that some people would like the old content to still be &quot;new&quot; or at least not mean so little compared to Lich King's dungeon/raids. This is them just giving those fanboys/girls a bit of their hearts desire. If you don't want to participate in it, well you'll have to wait and see just how the fight works, and then not bother with the memories if you're allowed to interact/not interact with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, this whole thread is a shitton of speculation. Nothing is confirmed about the fights so stop with the QQing and being a dick and just let people go &quot;OMGYAYICANHAS ....&quot; there's nothing wrong with people getting happy over old content made new...ish. <br />

<br />
<br />
Honestly? It looks like something put in there for data miners to find, and not a real achievement. :D (Either that or the conditions aren't actually what it says they are, they wouldn't put something in that two classes simply can't do.)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm kind of curious if we're actually killing those people in the 5 man or not. That's all the tournament quest givers and leadership. Killing them all would effectively wipe the place out and wouldn't make a lick of sense if you can still do the current valiant/champion dailies in 3.2. Except for the Black Knight of course, him we can kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what's with the QQ over a pretty cool and varied fight design like this. Lore wise it actually makes sense to fight a boss that tests you by making you relive your greatest achievements as a hero in Azeroth to prepare you for the biggest challenge of all.<br />
<br />
I hope they make it so that the confessor bases what you fight off what achievements/quests you have completed. Say she selects a member of the party, and pulls a memory out of him or her. If you have not actually killed algalon for example, how do you have memories of fighting him? The game tracks what quests and kills you actually have, so this sort of mechanic wouldnt actually surprise me as being impossible to do.</div></div><hr />

As a level 80 paladin, you should have no problem soloing him in his old form, lol.<br />

That said, I agree, it's very cool to see that these bosses will be retuned for 80, even if it's retuned for a five-man at 80, it's still very cool.</div></div><hr />

The death of Onyxia was quite canon. After the comic was released, the canon was just that she was slain by Varian, instead of a group of heroes.<br />
<br />
Also, Kael is very dead. Dead dead. Like, decapitated/impaled with a crystal dead. Which is admittedly about as dead as Megatron has ever been, so it's not like he still couldn't come back again.</div></div><hr />

Bolvar would make sense given the alleged translations of the draconic conversation Alexstrasza has at Wrathgate.... <br />

Lvl 60 you could do it with 10 people now (10 level 60s)<br />
<br />
Back then everything was set for level 60s, you can't max out a talent tree at lvl 60 for a specific spec now.<br />
