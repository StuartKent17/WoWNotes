This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Blizzard Retrospective<br />
After the 20 year Anniversary celebration of Blizzard Entertainment, a 50 minute documentary was released which tells the story of how three college students started and grew into one of the biggest game developing company of our time. If you are interested in the Blizzard universe, or want to hear great stories of what the company was like 20 years ago, make sure to watch the documentary.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 4.2 PvP<br />
A blue post confirmed that the Arena Season 10 would take place during Patch 4.2 of the Cataclysm. As usual, a full post featured all of the new sets that will be available for players who participate in PvP, along with a few great recolors.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Scroll of Resurrection<br />
The official announcement of the Scroll of Resurrection in 2012 was a great opportunity for players to bring their friends back to the game. This new product allowed players to boost all the way to level cap (80), get a free upgrade to the Cataclysm expansion, regardless of what expansion they own, a free character transfer and faction change, and 7 days of game time. Players who were able to Resurrect their friends were rewarded with a Spectral Gryphon or Wyvern based on their faction.<br />
<br />

<br />
Armored Bloodwing<br />
Patch 5.2 generated a lot of interest for the player base, however one of the hidden items discovered peaked the interest of many. The Armored Bloodwing was datamined early on, and found that it will be a flying/ground mount usable after level 20. The source of this mount was only later discovered when it was announced as a Blizzard Store mount only available for players who purchase it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 5.2 Live<br />
This patch has been mentioned several times in previous posts, but it is worth talking about it again, because this is the week it went live in 2013. Perhaps the biggest content patch of Mists of Pandaria featured a new raid, two new world bosses, new armor sets for both PVE and PvP, new reputation gear, an additional legendary questline, the unique Green Fire quest, two new zones, new scenarios, and numerous new rares and profession changes.<br />
<br />

<br />
Wish You Were Here<br />
The Warlords of Draenor Trailer “Wish You Were Here” featured a lonely gnome spending his time leveling before discovering the power of the Character Boost. This was of course the focus of the trailer, because the Pre-Purchase of the fifth expansion, Warlords of Draenor, included a complimentary level 90 character boost.<br />
<br />

<br />
Legion Animations - Fury Warrior<br />
With the overhaul of melee animation in Legion, Fury Warriors received new spell animations for a lot of their existing abilities, along with some brand new ones, such as Odyn’s Fury. The animations were updated to make Fury Warriors more unique, and make their iconic abilities easily recognizable. <br />

<br />
Your Watch Begins<br />
The official Overwatch street date was revealed in a short trailer video featuring all of the heroes in the game with iconic quotes, cinematic footage, and gameplay footage. The game announced at the previous BlizzCon was set to release on May 24th, while the official open beta started May 3rd.<br />

It's not Blizzard that is showing you anything, it's various dataminers.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terracresta</div><div class="date">2018-03-08, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not Blizzard that is showing you anything, it's various dataminers.<br />
<br />
They show us, that they are mainly putting new Horde stuff into the alpha client or else there would be Alliance stuff to datamine too. So if Blizzard is running out of time the might quickly put in some slapdash Alliance stuff and call it a day. Of cause this stuff shouldn't be as much work as other stuff like leveldesign, as long as they know what they are going for.<br />
<br />
The druid forms are not really my cup of tea, but it would be only fair that other races get more unique ones too but they should keep the old ones as an option. Would even say give Zandalari the normal troll druid forms as an option too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zephire</div><div class="date">2018-03-08, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What do you know, datamining shows what Blizz is currently polishing. How unusual.<br />
<br />
Well played Mione! Very well played.<br />
<br />
Though, what's up with Brigitte's waist? I think she would manage the paper test. Her model waist is small as it is, not to mention that it includes armour. If you'd strip her, she'd have none existent waist... I'm all for fit characters but that is just weird considering she has strong arms. Other than that she looks cool as a character and a hero!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya I watched it a few times myself over the years, thing that struck me is...that was made in 2011, that was seven years ago today, jebas does time fly.<br />
<br />
In that time they've brought out 4 more games, Diablo 3, Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, and Overwatch.<br />
They've made 3 more expansions for WoW, namely Mists of Pandaria, Warlords of Draenor, and Legion, and the 4th is currently in alpha, Battle for Azeroth.<br />
Several expansions for other games, Heart of the Swarm and Legacy of the Void for StarCraft 2, and Reaper of Souls for Diablo 3, not to mention the continuous updates that Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, and Overwatch are getting.<br />
And they also brought out a modern remaster of the original StarCraft last year.<br />
<br />
I know how big they've gotten, how much they've grown from that silly group of nerds that started Silicon and Synapse, but damn, that originality and creativity that created that first Warcraft RTS is still there, they're still going strong, and putting out quality titles, and just look at how many other studios disappeared who started at roughly the same time as Silicon &amp; Synapse (1991), heck several big publishers from that day and age are gone (MicroProse, Sierra, Eidos), or empty shells of their former selves (Interplay)</div></div><hr />

Yea, indeed very good Job Mione!!<br />
These days waay too few ppl care about progress, or achivements of this kind,We have hundreds of pages of posts about fuckin transmogs,troll models ,debates about what some Npc should say , polls about how long are the dicks of titans, or complains about how hard lfr can be....<br />
And why would they care, since literally everyone can open a damn chest on the map and get a bis leg, do 3 invasions and get a titanforged arcano, or kill normal argus once and get The bis trinket in game.This rng shit has gone too far unfortunately.<br />
Cheers again Mione!!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kyriani</div><div class="date">2018-03-08, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While you can tell the Zandalari male model is based on the night elf model, its got way better proportions, posture and stance.<br />
<br />
The chest is less &quot;stretched&quot; vertically than on the night elf, and the waist is more proportionate to the height compared to the night elf male as well.<br />
<br />
The Zandalari males also don't suffer as much from the pronounced &quot;my head is sticking out over my chest&quot; syndrome that night elf males (and humans for that matter) suffer from. Though they do have the same &quot;popeye&quot; forearms, its less noticeable due to better proportions elsewhere.<br />
<br />
All in all, I'd say they did a great job on them. Now if only human, night elf, and worgen males could visit the chiropractor to fix their posture and &quot;head foreward&quot; issues too.</div></div><hr />

Are you talking about the troll tattoo ones?<br />

Please ignore what i said, my pc just decided to default mmo champion media to 500% zoom. Has been happening for the past couple of weeks now, only on mmo champion, and i was starting to get a bit angry. Started to think that maybe you switched to some cool new resolution that my card doesn't support. Wasn't meant as a diss to you, chaud &lt;3</div></div><hr />

Way to be a bitter little bitch and have absolutely no understanding on how the development process works. Remember, you aren't meant to see this and Blizzard absolutely should not be developing things to accommodate sensitive faction equality nonsense in regards to *datamined* content.</div></div><hr />

Now they have put golden tattoos on the Zandalari which doesn't fit their culture in my opinion. I think they should have left the golden tattoos as unique to the Light-Forged Draenei.</div></div><hr />

Evvvvveerrrrryyy single expansion this happens to a class or race that sees no real reveals in alpha/beta and then gets tossed together in a rush-job for launch.<br />
EVERY. SINGLE. EXPANSION.</div></div><hr />
