PTR changes<br />
A few changes have been made to PTRs<br />
It looks like you can now &quot;collide&quot; with NPCs on the PvP tournament server, other players can't &quot;sit&quot; on top of the NPC to prevent other people to click it anymore.<br />
You can now inspect players from the opposite faction. (But it won't work if they're hostile/PvP Flagged)<br />
You can now join EU/US/KR PTRs with the same account !<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New test servers - PvP Tournaments<br />
The test tournament realm is a test of the new PVP Tournament realms you will not be able to copy characters there instead you will be able to create a level 70 and choose the equipment you want for PVP.<br />
We're glad to unveil the Arena Tournament item list page (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/items.xml (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/items.xml)) detailing the items that will be available to players participating in the 2008 Arena Tournament. Please keep in mind that the item list is not finalized and will most likely be changed based on feedback and testing. We wanted to give those interested a sneak preview of the items prior to the public testing phase. Visit our Arena Tournament information page (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/index.xml (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/index.xml)) for the latest information regarding the Arena Tournament.<br />

Sunwell boss dialogues - Full transcript<br />
The latest PTR build included all the sound files related to boss encounters in the Sunwell Plateau, and we learn a few more things about the two bosses remaining in Sunwell Plateau : M'uru/Entropius and Kil'jaeden.<br />
As speculated a few days ago in this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=4655.0), Entropius is indeed the evil form of M'uru (see Velen and Lady Liadrin dialogues). <br />
Anveena sacrifices herself ([spell=46474]) during the fight against Kil'jaeden, Kalecgos is here to help the players and it sounds like the fight will have at least 4 phases, one of them involving Kalecgos empowering orbs to help you.<br />
<br />

Well it was already been pretty known he doesn't die but is just pushed back through the Sunwell from his 'death' animation.<br />

You realize that this buff is overpowered enough as is? Every Shaman Spec can use Flametongue and everyone in said Shamans arena team can get the buff from Flametongue totem, it was definitely too overpowered at a straight 50% for one swing, I honestly think it should be a debuff added to Stormstrike or have it's mortal debuff at a flat 25%, quit complaining because you have to hit someone two times, you got your buff, be happy.</div></div><hr />

WAY UGLY STUPID DUMB WAY TO BIG. and WTF WTF the new alchemist stones are rediculously OP for how retardedly easy they are to obtian, and mats are a slap in the face. the healing one is better then the memento off illidan. GTFO blizzard with giving every scrub in the game such good loot, epics are no longer EPIC might as well just get rid of the whole uncommon common rare epic and legendary deal. way to sell out and cater completely to the mass populus and piss off the hardcores.<br />

@ s4 prediction: u r probably right, I already started saving points, but I doubt that any of the s4 ranged items will allow 1:1 rotation.<br />

<br />
I wasn't against this buff but I have forseen and told you all in the last thread that they will nerf it back down. There is no way 50% on every hit is going to get ahead, because not even warriors can do that.<br />
<br />
I suspect they may nerf it back even further after more field tests.<br />
<br />
Warrior is the first and the ultimate healing debuff class. Sure other class might be given the ability but I doubt Blizzard will allow any other class to do it better then warrior - just like the way it is for tanking. This is because the only reason why people take a warrior along is for that one ability, just like tanking in pve.</div></div><hr />

Im in MH/BT atm and I really couldnt care what other players in other guilds are wearing. Does it make you feel special to have epics. Do you see it as some sort of life accomplisment. Well its only a game accomplishment. The game is hella fun because I do enjoy my guildies alot. But thats it. Blizzard is a business and the business is to make money. If you were blizzard would you cater to 100,000 people or 9.99 million people? If your answer is a 100,000 then you have no concept of money and most likely still live at home with your mother.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the game for what the game is supposed to be and that is fun. If it feels like a job or if you are looking at wow so you can say you accomplished something in life then I trully feel sorry for you. Like I said if the game gets boring then QUIT. If its like a job then QUIT. If you disagree with blizzard then QUIT. If you cant quit then go get some help.</div></div><hr />
