<br />
Would you rather had them not hotfix it all?<br />
<br />
Puzzling how they do something helpful to a ton of the player base and you call them morons.<br />
<br />
I welcome the change, and look forward to upgrading my legendaries faster. If you want to go slower, then that is your prerogative.</div></div><hr />

It’s not really something that the game needs one way or the other, but it would be cool. We’ve also talked about (mostly jokingly) about removing the Legion Legendary limit entirely in the week(s) before 8.0 launch, and letting people go wild west with them. That’s probably not going to happen due to power level reasons, as it would be a very jarring when you level from 119 to 120 and suddenly all 12+ of your legendaries you have equipped turn off&quot;<br />

We can't make this game too fun now can we.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The change is great, the timing was bad.<br />
<br />
I and lots of players had done our heroic dungeons before hotfix, which means we are ineligible for it today.<br />
<br />
They could have wait a few hours before tomorrow daily reset</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree on that one ! Feels like they are completely out of touch with the ret community .<br />
And they don't have any answers to their problems , clearly no dev plays a dps paladin . :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ImpTaimer</div><div class="date">2017-06-23, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol at that &quot;avid warrior player&quot; who defends Focus Rage cancer. There's nothing exciting about Focus Rage and it's inherently anti-gameplay, anti-synergy. All they had to was make it so Slam applied a debuff to the target (much like how Execute does now with new gold trait) and call it a day.<br />
<br />
Everytime I see shit like that it's always some FOTM reroller parroting crap cause they're shallow and only care about doing the most dps so they'll harp whatever double-speak to avoid nerfs and rerolling.</div></div><hr />

When given polite and thoughtful feedback they fall on their face. It's like they need to be yelled at and ridiculed to engage their brains to respond.<br />
<br />
I'm convinced they came with answers and looked for questions than matched pre-made answers they decided on.</div></div><hr />

Yes, this is intended. This is due to a limitation of how quests function. We agree it isn’t an ideal design, and are investigating possible improvements. (Source)<br />

It seems that now that its a currency they fixed the issue you wont lose out on getting extra withering essences:)</div></div><hr />
