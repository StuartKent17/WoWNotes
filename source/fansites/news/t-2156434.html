Patch 7.2 - Transmog Set Tab<br />
Patch 7.2 adds a new tab to the appearance pane that lists item sets. Currently it isn't fully filled out, but it looks like it will include various Tier sets, allowing you to preview the set for each existing difficulty and determine which of the appearances you have collected. <br />

Build of the Month - January 2017<br />
Each month or so we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
All of the parts on this page are Amazon affiliate links. When you purchase your parts through them it helps support the site!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/january/ssdgraph.gif) are fairly flat right now, with most SSDs under $0.50 per gigabyte when on sale.<br />
<br />
Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D15 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L7UZMAK?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00L7UZMAK). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or streaming, you do not need the 7700K and would get more performance from spending that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

<br />
Oh here comes the Alienware hate again. <br />
<br />
I always wanted an Alienware since I first took notice of them back in 1999. I didn't end up purchasing one until 2010! It was a display model at my local Micro Center. I trusted that it was working well since it had been on display for nearly a year and I had tried it out a few times on a few intense games. I never ever had any problems with it in the 6 years that I owned it. Display model cost me $1k<br />
<br />
My dream has been to buy a dual gpu 17&quot; Alienware laptop. So when the M18x came out, I waited nearly 6 month after release and extensive reviews and ordered one from Dell. It arrived and I still love how powerful and huge the screen is, even today. I did have one issue with it, but I was able to bypass a known, minor sound card issue that had to do with the mobo. I could have gotten a refund and exchanged for another new laptop, but it would have the same issue if I tried to use the SP/DIF to 3.5mm audio adapter bent pin on mobo connection issue. Nonetheless I was happy with my $3k purchase.<br />
<br />
Finally I wanted an upgrade to my Area 51 desktop so I bought the previous gen Area 51 desktop (mode right before the triad design) from a Texas reseller and refurbished for $1k used. Added in a new GTX 970 and it runs everything flawlessly (video card issues from time to time, but that's Nvidias or the board manufacturers fault)<br />
<br />
I've heard horror stories about Alienware systems that won't even boot out the box but that hasn't been my experience. I plan to purchase a new Aurora desktop after I publish my first novel and receive some money for it. And if the system should have issues (I never purchase he basic warranty anyways) then I will work with Dell to get it resolved or get my money back!</div></div><hr />

The problem isn't that Alienware doesn't work (it does), but it is kinda like Apple - it works, it is expensive, but it is an easy sollution that is OK for most people. You could build a computer that works just as great as Alienware, but cheaper, but then you have to put in the hours of finding the right parts, putting it all together and make it all work. With Alienware (and other ready-built computers), you simply buy, and it's good to go.<br />
<br />
Never understood why people got a need to hate on Apple, Alienware, or anything really. If the person who got the item can afford it, why the fuck shouldn't he just do it simple? Building computers isn't for everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The major difference between Alienware and Apple is that with Apple you get a machine and OS that are custom made to work extremely well together, while Alienware is just overpriced PC in a fancy case. It's basically like watch. All keep time the same (arguably decent quartz watch even better than most mechanical watches) but you still see people with super expensive watches and people hating on it.</div></div><hr />

Alienware make top end hardware, the stuff they come out with is absolutely amazing. Sadly the price tag is always a bit too steep to go for. I'd personally rather just build my PC from the ground up, which I've been doing since I was about 13 :D Either way I can see the appeal as they're beautiful to look at and generally come with top end hardware. People who hate on Alienware are normally on the anti-hype train and are just blindly following what others are saying. <br />
<br />
Also Dell have some of the BEST support possible, if you purchase the pro support they really hook you up. Literally next day on-site on everything, unless there's a part shortage then generally they guarantee 5 working days. If they can't replace the part or fail to attend 3 times they just replace the entire machine, while generally upgrading the machine if some time has passed since originally purchasing it. We annually order 100-150 laptops with Dell and the support is perfect.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I ever saw someone in my guild eschew a Tier set for a Dungeon set of the same 'tier' of content back in the day. I mean, unless they broke a set bonus, but that did not mean that the sets themselves were on par.</div></div><hr />

I remember that being the case for some because of how a lot of T1 sets were pidgeonholed into one spec, making DS2 better for the other specs of the class, but that can't be the case anymore today.</div></div><hr />
