PvP Rewards Hotfixes - Offset Armor and Ashran Conquest<br />
Thanks again for all of your feedback. We’ve been discussing it heavily, and are going to make a few more changes.<br />
<br />
First, we’re going to make the remaining non-set armor pieces available on the Conquest vendors. They’ll still be available through the Champion’s Strongboxes, but if you’d rather not leave earning them up to random chance, you’ll be able to purchase them for Conquest points instead. With this change, the only items that will only be available through the Champion’s Strongboxes are the random-stat Accolade trinkets (which cannot be put on the vendors due to some technical hurdles). We're aiming to make this change with this upcoming weekly reset.<br />
<br />
Note that, as a result of this change taking place, we no longer plan to make the Champion’s Strongboxes purchasable with Conquest points for players who have earned the Wild Conquest achievement. Since nearly all of the items in the Strongboxes will be directly purchasable with Conquest points themselves, we feel that this would just add unnecessary frustration or confusion if players were to spend their Conquest on a Strongbox instead of just buying the item they wanted.<br />
<br />
The other change we’ll be making is to remove the Ashran-only 200 Conquest point bonus to the weekly Conquest cap. The total cap (1700 plus any additional bonuses from rating) will remain the same as it is currently, you just won’t have to go to Ashran to earn all of it. We're hoping to push this change live with this week's reset, but it requires a lot more programming and testing to make sure it's functioning properly, so it may not go live until the following week.<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for all the heartfelt feedback on this issue. We’ve definitely learned a lot of very valuable lessons, and are looking forward to seeing how the rest of Warlords Season 2 progresses!<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - July 24<br />
PvP<br />
Please note that the following PvP reward changes are currently still in-testing.<br />
<br />
Conquest vendors now sell non-set PvP armor pieces that could be found in the Champion’s Strongbox.<br />
Removed the Ashran-only 200 Conquest Point bonus to the weekly Conquest cap. Total Conquest cap remains unchanged, but characters no longer need to go to Ashran to earn all of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Creatures and NPCs<br />
Shadowmoon Valley<br />
<br />
Yggdrel's Entangling Vines should no longer continue to deal damage after the growth has been slain.<br />

Battlegrounds Bonus Event July 24-27<br />
The first Battlegrounds Bonus Event is underway. Through the end of the day on Monday, July 27, you’ll have a constant +200% boost to your honor gains from Battleground objectives and wins.<br />
<br />
Earlier this week, we asked you to pick your two favorite Battlegrounds (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/19824668). There’s still time to register your opinion; the poll closes on Monday.<br />
<br />
Keep an eye out for the event-only quest “A Call to Battle (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/39040-a-call-to-battle)”, which rewards 500 Conquest Points above your maximum when you win four Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
On which Battleground will you shine the most during the event?<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler has recently provided (http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler) longer answers to some questions than tweets would allow. What's your view on &quot;Bring the player, not the class&quot; philosophy from a couple of years perspective? Do you believe that ultimately it adds more to the game (better flow &amp; acessibility) than it takes away (not feeling unique in a big game) or not really and MMOs should embrace strong class diversity<br />
No, I'm still a fan of the philosophy. The state of the game before that was a value was one about building small groups to maximize buffs.<br />
<br />
I do feel that under my watch that class design did get a little too homogenized. It's tough because every day players would challenge us with &quot;Why do I have to be so bad on this one fight? Why can't I have a cool ability that makes me desirable?&quot; We would have (and probably should have) pushed back some on that even at the cost of game balance.<br />
<br />
I haven't been keeping up with the game so I can't comment on the state of class design today. I'm just talking about when I worked on things. <br />
<br />
Do you think Blizzard's philosophy changed when they merged with Activision? Back in 2008, they said nothing would change, but since then, seems like Blizzard slowly became more interested/focused on the general public (and profit).<br />
We never noticed much Activision influence down in the trenches. Maybe the execs felt it. I don't know.<br />
<br />
Profit is a weird thing in this business. Because, yes, it is a business, and not only do we want to keep the lights on, but many of us want to feel that we didn't make a mistake going into this industry. I think we've all played games that felt like they were focusing too much in tricking you out of your hard-earned cash and left us feeling icky. But that doesn't have to mean that being successful is a bad priority.<br />
I am exaggerating slightly here, but I get the feeling sometimes that some players would prefer developers to be sacrificing everything just to pour their soul into a game, that somehow the design is more pure and therefore better that way. In reality, that doesn't happen. World-class artists and hot-shot engineers kind of want to feed their families.<br />
<br />
Again, you can overdo it. Since League is essentially free to play, we strive to make players feel good about spending money and not to come across as too greedy. <br />
<br />
When you were still at Blizzard, players got used to you communicating with them, and giving them some insights on the decisions, you made. After you left some of the developers actually tried to follow your footsteps, like Celestalon. Then they opened common twitter and went silent, not good imo?<br />
It is hard for those of us on the outside to tell what is the desire of individual developers and what is company policy. <br />
<br />
Do you still play World of Warcraft?<br />
I haven't since I left Blizzard. That has zero to do with the game itself and more to do with my relationship with it. I was really, really close to WoW, as you can imagine. Some space has been good for perspective. As just one example, I actually had some trouble during my interview at Riot because I couldn't speak in depth about other game designs to the extent that I could about WoW; it took just so much of my bandwidth at work and at home. I am trying to be a more well-rounded designer now and immerse myself in other games.<br />
<br />
There are emotional reasons for the distance as well. I compare it sometimes to having a breakup with your SO. The split may have been for very good reasons, but still driving by their house or stalking them on social media brings up these unresolved feelings.<br />
<br />
If I had to guess, I'll be back and playing again in a year or so. <br />
<br />
Are you excited to see the Warcraft movie coming out next year and would you watch it?‎<br />
Totally. I wouldn't be surprised if we took a company trip to see it.<br />
<br />
I've hinted at this before, but players tend to extend the rivalries they feel with other games to the studios that make them, but we really don't feel it. We want the best for companies like Blizzard and Valve. I have friends at both studios. I want to see them succeed. <br />

Okay, this has to be accepted. Still I kinda want to nail down the expectations that I want to have of WoW to something more specific. I'd like to see the question if he thinks that the amount of content that we had in Wrath of the Lich King is appropriate to be expected as a customer for future expansions. Not exactly the same features, I don't expect new classes, but more looking at the amount of big zones, the immense capital, number of raids, dungeons, battlefront, that sorta thing. <br />

<br />
Why would they want to do it again? Can you imagine how much flack they would cop if for the first tier of raiding next expansion they just scaled up and re-used an existing raid? They would be utterly crucified for it, and quite rightly so. And Trial of the Crusader? That was barely a raid, they put more effort into 5 man instances these days than went into that raid. <br />
<br />
Not to mention there was absolutely nothing to do at level 80 outside of raiding, wintergrasp, and riding around in circles around Dalaran. They're already getting dragged over the coals for how theres 'nothing' to do currently at level 100 outside of raiding, but theres far, far more max level content these days than there ever was in Wrath days. Take off the rose coloured glasses for a second and try and get some perspective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's actually called 'The Grand Tourney' which I think works better than 'The Argent Tournament' for the tone they're going for - very silly/fun rather than paladins and crusaders, important lore, etc. There's pirates, murlocs and dragons running around for example, we've barely even seen any members of the Crusade itself show up yet (though I'm sure there'll be quite a few in there). It just gives the expansion a nice theme to tie it all together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your wrong about there being nothing to do, there were several daily hubs, and I did enjoy the daily quest experience of Wrath (and other expansions) more than WoD though. The daily hubs available in Wrath felt more compelling to me than the Apexis dailies that we initially had. I do quite like Tanaan, but even then I preferred having the grind broken up into individual quests, as in most other expansions.</div></div><hr />

You'll never get a straight answer to that. One, he's no longer there, so he doesn't know what's going on, and two, if he wants to keep working in the game industry, he's not going to divulge information like that. You just don't do it. That's high level policy/decision making - he may not even have been privy to that kind of decision making when he was there, just the effects, like &quot;You get 75% of the budget you got last time - make it count.&quot; No WAY he talks about that in public.<br />

A couple weeks ago, I got really pissed about something here. So I walked away, and realized - it doesn't matter. It's a video game, and a website about a video game. It doesn't matter. <br />

<br />
Nothing to do, in Wrath? LOL. That's a good one. I was constantly busy in wrath, with my main and alt. There was easily twice the amount of quest content alone - I did some poking around on WoWhead last year, Wrath had around 1400 quests PER FACTION in Wrath, WoD has around 700 - for the same number of levels. I did loremaster on several alts, and did all of the quests up to the final Icecrown ones, and it was a LOT of content. Then, you had dungeons to run, then heroics, there was Wintergrasp, the pvp ladder was very active (and yeah, win trading), professions were in an excellent place, fishing was compelling finally with the turtle mount and reps, there were tons of rep to run with good rewards, there were heirlooms to get tokens for, there was the Argent Tournament, there were mounts to craft, there were silly fun things like coins in the Dalaran fountain, fishing dailies, the books in Dalaran, grinding gold for flying, looking for the Time Lost Proto Drake or trying to get the Polar Bear mount, and that's just off the top of my head. Oh, yeah, raid Weeklies. <br />
<br />
Nothing to do at 80? Are you insane? Wrath had more content in every area of the game than any other expansion, only topped by the original release. In many ways, Wrath was the perfect expansion, and it's record number of subs reflect that. I'd resub in a heartbeat, even buy a year pass, if a Wrath like expansion was announced.<br />

As someone who only pve's and has never pvp'd, and generally ignores all the pvp stuff posted. From the outside looking in it looks like whoever is in charge of pvp this expansion is a fucking twat and has no clue what they're doing. All these constant changes, it looks like amateur hour. This ashran place sounds like a mess.<br />
<br />
Ashran was a repeat of AV. They don't seem to learn down there in Irvine. The players posted about the problems with Ashran at length during the beta, and were ignored - and like AV, they were forced to tweak, change, remove and water down the place until it's avoided, because they don't do revision very well. AV just needed the bridge changed - but instead they gutted it. This is the final nail in the Ashran coffin, it's a failure, and Holinka should by rights be polishing up his resume, but Blizzard seems to give second and third and fourth and fifth chances. I called out Holinka as a dick early on in WOD, because he was extremely arrogant about his creation, and it's been hilarious to watch him get more meek and apologetic for it as time has gone by. Creating this kind of content is clearly over his head, and they need to bring back the Wintergrasp designer if they want to do large PvP zones again. Maybe working under someone who is good at large scale pvp is what he needs.</div></div><hr />

This has been my take on PVP in WoD as well. I'm a raid-first player but in the past I've always dipped into PVP when I started to get burned out on PVE content. I have a lot of good memories of doing BGs in Vanilla through WotLK. It's tough that all of the eggs for PVP this expansion went into the Ashran basket because I've given it a few tries and it is just not something that I enjoy playing, especially now that they've removed the option for joining as a raid.<br />
<br />
Well, I can live with that but I'm also frustrated at the constant tuning/nerfing of classes at the altar of PVP when it has pretty major repercussions for PVE as well. The current combination of PVP being a mess and classes being shafted in PVE because of PVP tuning seems like a pretty bad one.</div></div><hr />

C'MON!<br />

Is it? Holy crap! I just read the FF14 topic...blasphemy! Don`t give up, not too late to learn read and understand short and simple words and sentences, like mmo-champion (mmo means massively multiplayer online) but i give you another hint: recently lot of videos was on the front page about Overwatch which is not even mmo....or rpg....or Hearthstone which is not any of these either. So what? I admit, the main profile is the Blizz ***licking (like posting stupid and unreasonable informations about how many player did something unimportant in the WoW:D No wonder on Alexa the popularity of this site went down by 1100)</div></div><hr />

The thing I liked better about WOTLK, apart from being a newb in that expansion, was the one main villain throughout (scared the shit out of me near Utgarde Keep where he kills you) and that it had 2 starting zones to choose between instead of 1. <br />
<br />
The thing that dragged back MoP grades was the 14 month long wait, BUT...I had more fun and more stuff to do across characters that felt fun and engaging through those 14 months than I've had so far in WoD...I miss Isle of Thunder especially...<br />

I worked at a pizza place right after college. I LOVE pizza, had it every day. After a year...I stopped eating pizza. Sick of it. But often it was all that there was to eat there. When i left, after 3 years (awesome job, I made assistant manager, and this wasn't a Dominos, it was a local family/sports place), I couldn't eat pizza again for a long time. <br />
<br />
I could only imagine the WoW burnout when you talk about it all day for several years, play it at work and at home for several years - and can't quit because it's your job.<br />
<br />
Yeah, be shocked he doesn't play, lol.</div></div><hr />

You had enough time to quote that, but not to read the very next sentence?<br />
<br />
&quot;I haven't since I left Blizzard. That has zero to do with the game itself and more to do with my relationship with it.&quot;<br />
<br />
But yeah, go on convincing yourself that he shares your point of view, and that his not playing is a direct reflection of all the flaws that you have seen in WoD that he hasn't even experienced yet. Makes perfect sense.</div></div><hr />
