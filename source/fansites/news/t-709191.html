Paladin Preview is Coming 
We appreciate all of our pink champions waiting just a bit longer to get their preview. While we had initially announced that we were planning to post the Paladin preview on Friday, April 16 we’re unfortunately not going to be able to release the preview on that date. 
 
Instead it will be posted Wednesday, April 14!

Vengeance Mastery Bonus<br />
If you've spent much time on this forum in the last several months, you'd have noticed a common theme is that tanks start to have threat problems again at extreme levels of gear. The problem really isn't that surprising. Say that tanks start out doing half the damage of DPS specs. All is well. But the DPS specs continue to improve their DPS stats while tanks continue to improve their survival stats. Even if tanks spend a little effort on threat stats (some of which they get naturally on their gear), they still can't keep up with the DPS specs. It's a gear scaling problem.<br />
<br />
We considered, and rejected, many other solutions to the problem, such as increasing threat modifier or choosing to no longer make tanking gear. Ultimately we decided that there were good things about the way rage works on warriors and bears (translating incoming damage into threat) and the way the mage talent, Incanter's Absorption turned damage taken into damage done. It just provides the damage increase in a way that's controllable.<br />
<br />
Vengeance is NOT there so that you no longer have to ever worry about threat. It's fine with us if you have to consider threat a little bit at the start of a fight. Again, if we wanted to make threat not a factor in WoW, we'd just remove it and have mobs always stick to you rather than just cranking the threat numbers up so high that you don't have to take it very seriously.<br />
<br />
Vengeance is also not designed to keep tank dps high no matter what in any circumstances. It's designed so that when you're being hit, your damage stays elevated. The damage done scales with your health, essentially allowing tank DPS to increase as DPS specs DPS increases. It scales a little bit with damage being taken too so that you don't turn into a juggernaut if a rogue sticks you with a dagger in PvP.

Paladin Class Preview<br />
I'm warning you now that we still have a lot of work to do on the paladin talent trees. The preview will have the new spells and passive talent tree bonuses, but we can't provide many details yet on specific talent changes. We can discuss general goals, but not many of those should come as a huge surprise to regular forum readers.<br />
<br />
As I've said recently, we didn't go with paladins last because we were saving the best for last or because we want to punish them or because we were at a loss for what to do. We just like to focus on one class at a time, and someone was going to be the last one. It's random. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262358928/paladin-previews-are-way-way-last/))<br />
<br />
Healing and Mana management<br />
The focus seems to be more on conserving mana, and not overhealing. Yeah. Paladins don't do that. <br />
They don't today. They will in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
The design of &quot;I never run out of mana, but I am very limited in the roles I can fill&quot; isn't a really awesome one. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262368937/in-light-of-the-quot-cata-healing-philosophy-quot/))<br />

Heroic Leap<br />
The challenge with previews is to provide enough context so players understand the goals of the abilities without providing so much detail that players get over-focused on the minutiae.<br />
<br />
Imagine Heroic Leap can be used in any stance, in or out of combat, hits for very serious AE damage and applies the Thunder Clap debuff. We keep it under control with a 2-3 min cooldown. This means warriors will sometimes be zipping in and out of melee, but that's kind of the warrior thing, and again the cooldown can help balance it.<br />
<br />
I don't think these concerns are hard to address. We screwed up in the preview, I think, by making it sound like Heroic Leap was supposed to be a replacement for a Charge / Tclap macro. That wasn't the intention. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262407685/heroic-leap-remove-change-explain/))</div></div><hr />

I think it'd be badass if we were able to dps with our shields. But that would seem like more of a warrior thing.<br />
Sacrifice would be a sweet skill to have too.<br />
<br />
edit: ALSO! a dps aura would be cool to have especially since they'll probably change our FCFS &quot;rotation&quot; to something that more resembles a rotation.</div></div><hr />

Then again those would have to be talents, not spells... well... dunno. And ret might finally be reworked from such a faceroll to something with a non passive debuff/dot or SnD like effect or something of that kind. Prot is more likely fine.</div></div><hr />

edit: on topic, glad to hear it. a day early isn't gonna make me foam at the mouth, but cool, anyways. maybe slightly anxious, I'd like to see more uniqueness in the classes rather than what I interpret as severe homogenization but given the trend with the other classes I'd say the latter.

you made me laugh so hard<br />
Self healing: lets see what other class can self heal mmmmm, priest, druids, shamans<br />
use weapons: i thought all classes were able to use weapons seems that i'm wrong<br />
stuns: mmmm stuns paladins only have 1 stun and its 1 min CD<br />
bubble: they can only use 1 at the time, last max 12 secs, can be dispel<br />
plate armor : means nothing to casters, and seems like in cata the armor value difference wont be so huge.<br />
Monster DPS: we do decent dps on pve and we have to ramp it up, pvp we dont have enought burst to kill a healer and our dps is so shitty that they will never be oom.</div></div><hr />

Actually, as a resto. druid main I am waiting to find out how Holy Paladins get changed :)<br />
<br />
As the only other full hybrid (tank/heal/dps), Paladin changes may give us a big clue as to what they will do about the new Tree of Life cooldown. Also, as the class with least mana management issues in an upcoming expansion which will be all about mana management (at least for healers) and downranking/heal spell diversity, it should be interesting to see what they give or remove from Holy...</div></div><hr />

Other than that pallies don't really need anything, they are in a pretty good place imo - I see some flavour abilities and stuff that shares CDs with spells that are already in place. <br />

Holy, however, needs a nerf. Disc priests especially and resto shammies to a degree as well should be able to tank heal at least as well as holy pallies.</div></div><hr />

So because you can't heal raid as well as other healers (disc has trouble with raid as well btw) you deserve to be leaps and bounds better at tank healing than other classes to the extent that 9 times out of 10 other classes aren't even considered for tank healing? Because that is the state of the game now. And there really wasn't any need to be rude but honestly you sound like the idiot.<br />
<br />
Edit: Now I think about it maybe calling for a nerf isn't necessary but other classes/specs should be brought up to Holy level for tank healing or you should get some sort of raid healing option.</div></div><hr />

We're great at MT because that's our job. Notice how hard the bosses hit now in ICC? We need huge heals. Disc are actually rather good MT healers, they have bubble and hots and direct heals. Now I won't pretend to be a raiding Disc healer, but from when they heal in raids that I've been in they've been successful tank healers.<br />
<br />
So I guess we deserve to get nerfed (to the ground) because we're too damn good at one thing. Gotcha. I've been healing on my paladin since Kara (was a mage in Vanilla) and it's changed -for the better- since then.</div></div><hr />

They cannot even afford a lol-tool (think lolgrip for priests and shrooms for moonkins) for retris tbh because of the drastic changes they could make to retri. <br />

Traditionally, RPG character development is focused on emulating fantasy archetypes. While there is such a thing as a holy archer archetype, it is both weak and also tied to use of bow. The concept of the heavily armored warrior fighting with pure holy energy, while it may sound compelling, does not yet exist in fantasy literature or popular culture, so it does not constitute a fantasy archetype which would mean that if Blizzard decided to sell it, they would need to make an extra effort to present a story or better yet a heroic figure that uses that combat style.</div></div><hr />

Since blizz wants at least 2 classes being able to give the same buff, here are my predictions:<br />
<br />
•Mark and kings merged. Gc said it was a solution in a thread and 2 classes will now be able to do mark and kings(without the drums. Gc wants drums removed.)<br />
<br />
•Battle Rez will now be given to paladins. It's not really a buff, but it's pretty much a must havein any serious raiding content.</div></div><hr />

The preview will have the new spells and passive talent tree bonuses, but we can't provide many details yet on specific talent changes. We can discuss general goals, but not many of those should come as a huge surprise to regular forum readers.<br />
its because of that that they are going to realease it on 14th so that they get yelled when 16th and they say sorry we still havent figuritout yet wait a litle more.<br />
<br />
So basic stuff caming 14th and real stuff caming when?</div></div><hr />

Around the time, the other classes get more than 3-5 of ther new talents previewed.. <br />
<br />
You'll get your new Spells, your masteries and a short design plan for your trees (which is around the same what other classes got)</div></div><hr />

What kind of logic is this? Make a class less fun to balance population? Just make other classes even more fun instead would be far more reasonable</div></div><hr />

The focus seems to be more on conserving mana, and not overhealing. Yeah. Paladins don't do that. <br />
They don't today. They will in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
The design of &quot;I never run out of mana, but I am very limited in the roles I can fill&quot; isn't a really awesome one. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262368937/in-light-of-the-quot-cata-healing-philosophy-quot/))<br />

<br />
Again - how on earth was the class gonna be able to think about conserving mana when the devs gave them a tools that did everyting in two spells ? We were gonna remove beacon of light between needing them ? Or switching specs to not use glyph of holy light when we needed to big heal tank ? <br />
<br />
Comon BLizzard - Its now up to you to fix this. And you dont do that by adding more buffers to 2 main heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you may be misinformed on the tiers of casters.<br />
Warriors are any character with an excessive number of muscles and a stick with more blades on the end than most people have teeth.<br />
Druids are wizards who rely on nature magic to transform themselves into enhanced versions of nature's greatest creations.<br />
Warlocks are evil Mages who draw their power from demons, either willingly or otherwise.<br />
Rogues are murdering, backstabbing cutthroats who rely on stealth, deception and trickery to get the job done.<br />
Death Knights are to Paladins what Warlocks are to Mages: Corrupt and, generally, Evil.<br />
Again, you don't seem to know much about the tiers of casters.<br />
Shaman are similar to druids, except they drew on the elements themselves in addition to nature.<br />
I'm pretty sure that was the Templar.<br />
<br />
Overall, you just seem very misinformed. I'm still laughing at you comparing Harry Potter to a Mage though ;)<br />
<br />
You do realize I was responding to a post saying paladins had no point in history. All you did was talk about the actual class descriptions within WoW. <br />
<br />
I was laughing at you saying merlin was a mage, he was a wizard, hence the harry potter comment.<br />
<br />
And yes, paladins were the 12 legendary knights who followed charlemagne around. Look it up or just pull up the actual link I posted where it states that.<br />
<br />
No other class in wow has an actual historic group to relate to asside from druids, and they were just a joke dancing around naked under the moon.</div></div><hr />

I didn't realise what you were responding to, I was actually commenting on the general description of the classes over the breadth of role-playing games.<br />
<br />
<br />

Alright, alright, but come on. Harry Potter couldn't beat a level 1 mage in any game let alone the characters we play.<br />
<br />
<br />

Congratulations, you found a link to something on the internet. The Templar were responsible and not all of them were considered Paladins. Ignore that, I'm a fool. However, the Templar were responsible for many thing and they are what many people stereotypically think of as 'paladins', when they weren't.<br />
<br />
<br />
No other class in wow has an actual historic group to relate to asside from druids, and they were just a joke dancing around naked under the moon.<br />
The warrior has been around since, oh, people made weapons? I think they predate paladins a little. The entire idea of a warrior is so basic that the historic group isn't necessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is just a generic description though. Like mage is a magician. Warlock is an evil magician. Priest is a religious leader. Shaman typically religious leader of many indian tribes.... etc etc.<br />
<br />
Druids are an actual group that existed, although historically they are kind of silly.<br />
<br />
Paladins are the only actual historic group that was completely bad ass and beat the crap out of the Sacacen horde during religious crusades.<br />
<br />
The only equivalent would be if hunters were instead marines, or warriors were instead spartans, or priests were instead called cardinals/bishops, or shaman were apache.<br />

Priests, Shamans, and Druids of old, did some FUCKING SCARY THINGS. Things with innards, sacrifices, lots of blood and gibs, organs, eating them, reading stuff from them, cutting out hearts of living people, the inquisition (NOBODY EXPECTS IT!), etc. While priests and &quot;spirit healers&quot; in general were kinda the &quot;wise guys&quot; compared to the common people of old, those common people had lots of things to fear from them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
priests and shamans were both the spiritual guides of the people, they were wise. priest got slapped around by paladins if they got out of order when they did their crusades because the king would send them on a holy crusade to bitch slap any other that stepped out of line. if a priest said &quot;and god says the king is wrong&quot; the paladin would beat the crap out of the priest and say &quot;who is wrong?!&quot; and the priest would cry. the shamans had no one to put them in their place if they went corrupt.</div></div><hr />
