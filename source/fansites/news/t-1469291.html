In approximately one week (no sooner than March 10), the Mists of Pandaria Digital Deluxe edition (http://www.battle.net/shop/product/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria) will be earning a bit of much-deserved rest in the Blizzard Archive. If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your standard edition for the in-game extras or contemplating coming back to the game to check out the latest content, you might want to consider snagging the Digital Deluxe Edition now before it heads into the vaults.<br />
<br />
If you already own the standard edition of Mists of Pandaria and are interested in upgrading, you can head over to your account management page (https://www.battle.net/account/management/) to do so now. The Digital Deluxe edition might come back out of the archive in the future, but even the jinyu waterspeakers don’t know if or when.<br />

Warlords of Draenor Racial Traits<br />
We’re planning some changes to racial traits for Warlords of Draenor. We recently posted a Dev Watercooler (Pruning the Garden of War) that dives deeper into the philosophy behind these changes, and now we wanted to give you the full details of what’s coming.<br />
<br />
In order to keep racials more in line with one another, we’ve decided to bring down a couple of high outliers, then establish a fair baseline and bring the other racials up to that. We’re accomplishing this by improving old passives, replacing obsolete ones, and adding a few new ones where necessary. Ultimately, our goal is to achieve much better parity among races.<br />
<br />
There aren’t any current plans to change Pandaren or Worgen racials.<br />
<br />
Blood Elf<br />
Arcane Acuity is a new racial passive ability that increases Critical Strike chance by 1%. Arcane Torrent now restores 20 Runic Power for Death Knights (up from 15 Runic Power), 1 Holy Power for Paladins, or 3% of Mana for Mage, Priest, Warlocks (up from 2% of Mana). Other aspects of the ability remain unchanged.<br />
<br />
Draenei<br />
Heroic Presence has been redesigned. It no longer increases Hit by 1%, and instead increases Strength, Agility, and Intellect, scaling with character level. Gift of the Naaru now heals for the same amount over 5 seconds (down from 15 seconds).<br />
<br />
Dwarf<br />
Crack Shot has been removed (was 1% Expertise with ranged weapons). Mace Specialization (was 1% Expertise with maces) has been replaced with Might of the Mountain. Might of the Mountain is a new racial passive ability that increases Critical Strike bonus damage and healing dealt by 2%.<br />
<br />
Stoneform now also removes magic and curse effects in addition to poison, disease, and bleed effects, along with reducing damage taken by 10% for 8 seconds. It remains unusable while CC'd.<br />
<br />
Gnome<br />
Expansive Mind now increases maximum Mana, Energy, Rage, and Runic Power by 5% instead of only increasing maximum Mana. Escape Artist’s cooldown has been reduced to 1 minute (down from 1.5 minutes). Shortblade Specialization (was 1% Expertise with one-handed swords and daggers) has been replaced with Nimble Fingers. Nimble Fingers is a new racial passive ability that increases Haste by 1%.<br />
<br />
Goblin<br />
Time is Money now grants a 1% increase to Haste (up from only attack speed and spell haste).<br />
<br />
Human<br />
Mace Specialization has been removed (was 1% Expertise with maces). Sword Specialization has been removed (was 1% Expertise with swords). The Human Spirit has been redesigned. It no longer increases Spirit by 3%, and instead now increases two secondary stats by an amount scaling with character level. You can choose which two secondary stats it increases. This has not yet been implemented.<br />
<br />
Night Elf<br />
Quickness now also increases movement speed by 2% in addition to increasing Dodge chance by 2%. Touch of Elune is a new passive ability which increases Haste by 1% at night, and Critical Strike Chance by 1% during the day.<br />
<br />
Orc<br />
Axe Specialization has been removed (was 1% Expertise with axes). Hardiness now reduces the duration of Stun effects by 10% (down from 15%).<br />
<br />
Tauren<br />
Brawn is a new racial passive ability that increases Critical Strike bonus damage and healing done by 2%. Endurance now increases Stamina by an amount scaling with character level, instead of increasing Base Health by 5%.<br />
<br />
Troll<br />
Berserking now increases Haste by 15% (down from 20%). Beast Slaying now increases XP earned from killing Beasts by 20% instead of increasing damage dealt versus Beasts by 5%. Dead Eye has been removed (was 1% Expertise with ranged weapons).<br />
<br />
Undead<br />
Will of the Forsaken’s cooldown has been increased to 3 minutes (up from 2 minutes).</div></div><hr />

From a minmax perspective, one stat will /always/ be better. We will continue to see a sea of Worgen Druid in progression raiding on ally side because I dont want to look for a daytime raiding guild for that 1% extra minmaxing.<br />
<br />
(Im refering to just my class in it's current state, yes, but it doesn't change the fact that having racials that change every X amount of hours are silly.)</div></div><hr />

You do know that WOTF will now not share a cooldown (or at least be on cooldown for 2 min after trinket use, but be up afterwards). And they are still looking at EMFH , so far undecided if it will be changed / removed / given to all classes (and thus undead losing WOTF)</div></div><hr />

Oh I didn't realise that the solution to one side being overtuned was to crush theirs and buff the others; my mistake for having a tiny bit of common sense. I guess we have to factor in that you want to be a super special RP hero and be able to have better racials too.</div></div><hr />

Because they would have to think of something new to complain about? I dunno ... sounds interesting to me that they would bring it back, maybe they could do that with the older ones ... never saw the reason of removing things like that. Physical yeah, but not the digital. It would be nice for everyone else to have a chance to get BC, Wrath and Cata if they didn't get it before. :)<br />

<br />
This is my thoughts exactly! Excape artist and wotf are pretty similar cc removals and yet gnomes now get to use theirs 3 times as much as undead. I can't see why Draenei are getting a primary stat buff when no other race has anything like that. Humans are getting a secondary stat buff as well and both of these will scale with character lvl which im assuming will = out to much more than the 1% anyone else is getting. It's funny that almost all of the horde racials are getting nerfed and all the ally are getting buffed.</div></div><hr />

From what I can figure, Blizzard Devs are all playing something the polar opposite of what posters are playing, and therefore they will always do things to screw over said poster. <br />

What amazes me is they are using this supernatural ability to troll people on forums and didn't use it to go back in time and kill Hitler. GG Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Humans, Gnomes, Dwarves, Draenei and Night Elves all received buffs to their racials while the Horde either stayed the same or got nerfed in some way. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tziva</div><div class="date">2014-03-03, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my thoughts exactly! Excape artist and wotf are pretty similar cc removals and yet gnomes now get to use theirs 3 times as much as undead. I can't see why Draenei are getting a primary stat buff when no other race has anything like that. Humans are getting a secondary stat buff as well and both of these will scale with character lvl which im assuming will = out to much more than the 1% anyone else is getting. It's funny that almost all of the horde racials are getting nerfed and all the ally are getting buffed.<br />
Honestly, I wouldn't worry yet. I am sure they will tweak the stat/performance bonuses quite a bit during beta.<br />
<br />
The 'on use' racials like WotF and Escape Artist and the like will probably end up favouring particular races, as they do now, but I'm sure as far as straight +DPS/HPS bonuses, Blizzard will try to balance those so they are very similar across the races. <br />
<br />
<br />
Why would you play a race cause of the racials? Like, seriously?<br />
People who min/max or are apathetic to what race they play and figure they might as well pick the best one.<br />
<br />
I'm not a major min/maxer, but when pandaren were released, I felt pretty compelled to make my Alliance resto shaman one, since the difference between Draenei racials as resto (zero usefulness) to panda was enormous. I wouldn't ever do it for a minor gain but when they disparity is huge, it's a lot more appealing.</div></div><hr />

I was Tauren back in BC because there was no other choice (besides going Alliance, ewww) to be a Druid. They had the worst possible racial ability back before Feral DPS was really a thing. Then in WOTLK you make Feral DPS awesome, and still have the same shitty racial.. then Cata comes along and OGM TROLL DRUIDS WITH AN ACTUAL USEFUL RACIAL ABILITY TIME TO RACECHANGE WHEE! ... and now you've giving Taurens an awesome 2% crit damage passive? Time to go back Tauren...<br />
<br />
Why can't you just do away with all racial abilities and let people chose the race they want to be?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If WotF no longer shares a partial cooldown with the PvP trinket (which I have heard is the case), then it's not as bad as people believe. So that needs to be confirmed. Especially how the new trinket buff will make you temporarily immune to the same effect, this will likely give UD a lot of outs in a very short time period. As someone who plays a UD, I'm curious to see how this plays out in Beta before passing judgement.<br />
<br />
Trolls are pretty crazy in PvE right now and definitely needed a nerf. The fact that guilds stack trolls says all you need to say about that. <br />
<br />
As for Humans, does EMFH get the new trinket bonus (immunity to same effect)? Plus, I believe they tweeted that they still aren't sure if it's going to remain the same, so again I'll wait to see what becomes of it. Personally Dwarf looks pretty interesting right now if I was making a new toon and didn't have a race I was looking to play. Dwarf Rogue with double Cloak of Shadows is pretty crazy.</div></div><hr />

Something doesn't have to be released, out, in player's hands this very second for people to complain about how unfairly they think Blizzard is treating them with their ideas for their race in the next expansion.

<br />
yeah i play a human and undead rogue.<br />
<br />
Gnoms will rule surpreme with these changes, 5% energy is infinately better than any 5% of the the resources other classes gets. For a passive its very strong. And all was said about escape artist with 1 min cd. One must be almost mad not to go rogue, however, dwarf is strong too, with removing all dots imaginable + bleeds it makes it better than cloak when it comes to removing only dots to go into stealth mode.<br />
<br />
not sure if wotf will remain as powerful. 3 mins and fears only last 6 secs down from 8. And probably they change it so it breaks sooner too, who knows?<br />
<br />
Right now undead rogues are very powerful with wotf as fears are very strong right now and the rogue has no active fear breaker. you notice this more in cc chains when playing in the arena.</div></div><hr />

What about human's two scaling secondary stat racials when other races get only one. With the current design it is like granting both expertise bonuses with only just a mace or just a sword equipped.

Dwarves don't get a 2% critical strike racial, but a critical strike bonus damage increased by 2% racial. Your crits will just hit for 2% more instead of having more chances on getting critical hits.</div></div><hr />

Damn.. When I read that, I understood it as only removing one at a time. If they remove it all then holy crap. Ally has a lot of good pvp racials in WoD, while Horde gets their equivalent racials nerfed.</div></div><hr />

Arcane Torrent now restores 20 Runic Power for Death Knights (up from 15 Runic Power), 1 Holy Power for Paladins, or 3% of Mana for Mage, Priest, Warlocks (up from 2% of Mana). Other aspects of the ability remain unchanged.<br />
<br />
WoW, Sacrebleu! Are you kidding me, restores 1 HOLY POWER FOR MY UBER OP HOLY PALADIN? I'm gonna jump off a cliff from happiness. Totally OP compared to new buffed DWARF racial. Haha this game is a joke, seriously, 1 holy power every 2min(?) vs removes every shit debuff from the game and increases ur armor. Belfs op, nerf now.<br />
<br />
It needs a bit more work. My problem with it from a Warlock and Mage perspective is that, barring arcane, mana is of little use to me, and I doubt this is going to change much in WoD. I'd rather see AT regenerating Burning Embers, for instance. Not mana. At the moment, it's not a very compelling racial. The silence effect is also less useful to casters since you need to be in melee range to use it, which is ok for those rare situations where a DK is on your tail or you run by a healer and silence them, but barring that... not too useful.</div></div><hr />

I won't be buying any of your products, and you bet your ass I'm uninstalling. &quot;Balancing&quot;. What a fucking joke. Your higher-ups need to get off the drugs, pronto, because they're making some really cracked out decisions.<br />
<br />
First of all, call down. None of these racials are game breaking and none of this is finalized. So chill out and take a deep breath. But, if you decide that you just have to be alliance for some reason, you do realize that you can easily just roll a new character and boost to 90 before the expansion (with the free boost you get, so no money involved) and gear them out in full TI gear that you probably already have sitting in the bank (since its' BoA and drops like crazy), right?<br />
<br />
You can have a free, very geared out level 90 Alliance &lt;insert class&gt; before the expansion begins. <br />
<br />
If you want to talk about giant F U's to employeed people, nothing they do here is anywhere close to what used to happen in Vanilla with people quiting their jobs to get Rank 14 in PvP or being forced to raid 5 nights a week if you wanted to PvE. So please, get some perspective.</div></div><hr />

Humans, Gnomes, Dwarves, Draenei and Night Elves all received buffs to their racials while the Horde either stayed the same or got nerfed in some way. <br />
<br />
As an alliance ex-player it looks like a lot will go gnome who haven't already (gnome rogues everywhere I bet) but it definitely wouldn't make me consider returning if this is their idea of being fair under celestalons reign.<br />

30 seconds actually. If they remove that CD share though, &quot;nerfing&quot; it to 3 minutes seems fair. Throw in that trinket grants immunity to similar effects for a few seconds, and UD will still be very strong.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xPheno</div><div class="date">2014-03-03, 09:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I see are big Alliance racial buffs and even more Horde racial nerfs. Let's consider what some of these similar racials do, like Escape Artist / EMFH / WotF. They are all used to remove CC. <br />
<br />
- EMFH is arguable the absolute best of the bunch, considering it's all-around useful for both PvP and PvE. Even in PvP it gives you a bigger power spike for freeing up a trinket slot as trinkets become better.<br />
- WotF has seen so many continuous nerfs since day 1 that it's now a hollow shell of the former ability, also it's only slightly useful in PvE for fears since almost nothing will Charm or Mind Control you in a raid environment (and even if it does most of the time WotF is not usable, since MC for example is usually a major mechanic that Blizz doesn't want you to cheese). Nerfed to 3 whole minutes this time because apparently it's still too strong of a racial. No longer has the fear / charm / MC immunity that lasts for a few seconds after, that was removed a long time ago. Also puts a cooldown on your PvP trinket and vice-versa. Although some people say Blizz is removing this shared cooldown restriction it remains to be seen.<br />
- Escape Artist, buffed to a 1 minute cooldown, gets rid of snares and roots. I would already prefer this ability over WotF since it has such a short cooldown and in PvE, especially for someone who tanks as much as I do, it's imperative that your movement speed remains unhindered.<br />
<br />
I know they say they are going to be changing EMFH but as far as the concept for the ability goes, how much more could they change it? It does exactly what it's supposed to do, replace the PvP trinket. They can't possibly be nerfing it as hard as WotF has been nerfed (even though WotF is only usable on 3 forms of CC) since all I see are Alliance racial buffs across the board. If they changed EMFH, it would have to be a complete redesign. There's no nerfing or buffing an ability like that without nerfing or buffing PvP trinkets.</div></div><hr />

WORD.<br />
<br />
The unofficial -- but most valuable -- troll racial is simply &quot;Awesomeness.&quot; <br />
<br />
Loves me some trolls.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just do away with racials completely. Seriously, we don't need them.<br />
I understand the motivation to do this, and I kinda agree with Blizzard's hindsight review that they might have just skipped on racials from the start had they known what trouble they'd be, but since they are in now, they should stay that way.<br />
<br />
Other than the stat boosts, many of them are utility or fun or flavour type things that aren't particular harmful to the game, but probably are things players enjoy or appreciate. Think Diplomacy (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20599-diplomacy), Shadowmeld (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/58984-shadowmeld), Bouncy (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/107076-bouncy) or Rocket Jump (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/69070-rocket-jump) or Wisp (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/20585-wisp-spirit). Players absolutely would miss those, and they're not gamebreaking for them to continue to exist. Some players might pick a race because one sounds more appealing than another, but it's unlikely to result in pressure on players to reroll later when min/maxing or whatever.<br />
<br />
And the DPS boosts, while they're not balanced now, have the potential to be fairly equal if Blizzard maths them right, so I think removing those is still inferior to just making them worth similar values across the board, with the unavoidable minor value variations between classes/specs.<br />
<br />
So the only real problematic racials at the end of the day to me are ones like EMFH (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/59752-every-man-for-himself), WotF (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/7744-will-of-the-forsaken), etc. We can remove those kinds to even things up without throwing the whole concept of racials out the window.</div></div><hr />

10% would be INSANE for an in and out combat effect. 2% is fine. It's enough so that you'll eventually be able to catch up with other players in PvP instead of JUUUST being an inch out of range to charge them. If you played any MOBAs, think of those characters with movement speed passives who are slightly faster than other characters. Their MS passives never exceed more than like 3% bonus movement speed.</div></div><hr />

They really haven't a clue about racials and fairness (forget balance).<br />
Humans, Gnomes, Dwarves, Draenei and Night Elves all received buffs to their racials while the Horde either stayed the same or got nerfed in some way. <br />
<br />
As an alliance ex-player it looks like a lot will go gnome who haven't already (gnome rogues everywhere I bet) but it definitely wouldn't make me consider returning if this is their idea of being fair under celestalons reign.<br />
<br />
And 10 years of Horde favoritism was fair, everyone knew for 10 years if you wanted to be competitive in PVE and PVP you went horde because they had the better racials.. But heaven forbid that Blizz are actually trying to level the playing field when it comes to racials..<br />
<br />

GG blizzard picking the alliance side :(<br />
all they really did on the horde side was take stuff away :/<br />
<br />
And horde had it good for 10 years now there might be a level playing field when it comes to racials..<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
These racials are stupid, I wish I could choose my race based on how it looks not because of stupid stats that force my decision. They need to remove all stat based racials and just have cosmetic ones.<br />
<br />
yes that would be nice and easy for Blizz to balance and then there would be a level playing field, but the bulk of players would QQ like no tomorrow..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2014-03-04, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fault lies with the hardcore progression crowd for making a big deal about racials, such as with Berserking (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/26297-berserking). I enjoy having that mini-Bloodlust because it's a nice CD to have, not because I'm an ardent min-maxer. I didn't create a troll shaman back in old WoW because of the racials -- and Berserking back then (https://wowpedia.org/Berserking#Patch_changes) was a not-so-great CD, I must add -- but having it nerfed...!<br />
<br />
I've never race-changed any of my characters and I won't start now, but the nerf is not an easy one to accept.<br />
<br />
Touch of Elune is a new passive ability which increases Haste by 1% at night, and Critical Strike Chance by 1% during the day.<br />
I'd be surprised if this survives. How would day/night be determined? How could this be an interesting racial for those with schedules that leave them spending the majority (or even all) of their WoW time during one phase. It sounds like a neat racial, but the actual game play for it may leave something to be desired.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fuck this.<br />
<br />
Unlike the other racials that provide some type of CC-dispel, Every Man For Himself actually replaces a CC-Break PvP trinket; it isn’t in addition to it. So what you gain with EMFH is actually a trinket slot. Thus its power is very much related to what trinkets there are available. We're still determining our plan for PvP trinket itemization, so haven't decided on what to do with EMFH quite yet. It’s quite strong, and we agree that it looks unfair from those patch notes; we just haven't decided what to do with it yet. So, don't take that list as a statement that EMFH won't be changing somehow.<br />

Especially since it seems to be their only useful racial. Most races seem to get at least 2. <br />
<br />
15% * 10s / 180s = 0.83% (Compared to 1% passive.)<br />
<br />
I guess its value is that you get another CD that you can use (staggered though) or in fights that don't exactly last 3/6/9mins.<br />
<br />
Also I hope they realize that if they don't change EMFH the QQ will be ridiculous. With the human spirit being extremely good as is (at least 1% passive if not more) EMFH should probably be removed or at least redesigned to mirror the undead one.</div></div><hr />

So I don't think EMFH will or should be nerfed before that is corrected. I for one would welcome shorter queues as horde and more balanced world pvp. After some top guys feel that they are forced to change faction, many middle tier guys will follow and the problem will solve itself.<br />
<br />
What horde needs is casual pve players, and such racials as +20% xp is perfect for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pandaren also have an Exp boost racial that becomes useless at the Level Cap. Given that there's a new Level Cap with every expansion however, I can see it being great for people who will be trying to get Realm First Level 100's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah okay blizz.<br />
<br />
To be fair, Fear/Sleep is generally a much worse CC than Roots and Snares. Casters can continue to cast while in Roots and Snares. Are they 3:1? I don't think they are, but you can't compare them as if they are equal either.<br />

<br />
Play both alliance and horde. The fact that Horde was better for 10 years doesn't make it right that they are worse now.<br />
How would people have reacted if the alliance was stronger before the changes and weaker after? The exact same.<br />
<br />
Still don't get that people think the Horde deserves to get nerfed because of a design flaw.<br />
<br />
Actually, Alliance was much better in Vanilla for both PvE and PvP simply because they had Paladins. It wasn't until TBC that Horde Racials started getting better when they buffed Troll zerking and Blood Fury. At that time, Alliance far out numbered horde, mainly because PvE (Fearward + Cleanse-bots).<br />
<br />
But it's really hard to compare these abilities, I think the only races we can really compare 1v1 is probably Dwarves and Tauren's because they share one racial (2% crit damage/healing). Dwarves have Stoneskin and the Cows get an AoE interupt/stun. Depending on the class, I can see either being preferred. I'd personally give the edge to Dwarves, but I think someone much better at PvP could easily convince me otherwise.<br />
<br />
Oh, I forgot, BE's have 1% Crit and an AoE Silence that returns rage/energy/HP/mana/focus, Worgen have 1% crit plus a sprint (that everyone just snares anyway). I'd say BE's have it better there for almost all classes.</div></div><hr />

The pandaren racial boosts rested XP. Seeing as how that is completely wiped every xpac, you'd have to log out to get it and I really don't see anyone pushing for world firsts doing that. Contrast to the new troll racial, which if someone finds a good boosting spot like the crabs in Krasarang in WoD, will 100% guaranteed that the first person to 100 will be a troll.<br />
<br />
As for me, my main is a human pally so I can't complain. New Human Spirit sounds amazing, and as long as EMFH and Diplomacy don't get nerfed I'll be playing probably the best race for PVP and PVE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if i had to pick the worst race at the current time it would be: undead<br />
the best would be either gnome or draenei due to the resource increase for melee classes or the passive aura for friendlies.</div></div><hr />

It was not as clear cut as you think. I would say that there were probably more fights were alliance had advantage with BoM, but then again there were fights that were complete jokes as horde (hello huhuran and viscidus for example) compared to alliance side. Fearward was only op in PvP, if your tanks couldn't dance then you were out of luck anyway, most would've rather take 5% hp from tauren. Shadowmeld was situationally good when it still allowed drinking and casting while melded, perception was good if you were rogue dueling other rogues, but those were no where near as good as 25% resist to stuns or wotf (which also had immunity, not only trinket effect).</div></div><hr />

People who worry about min/maxing in a game that is forever changing are fighting a battle they will never be able to win anyways. I gave up on it long ago and enjoy the game way more than being OCD over something as trivial as a few dps increase. Personally I will still continue to play horde because they just overall look cooler and have cooler architecture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tauren wasn't 5% more HP, it was 5% of base, which was only a few hundred HP in Vanilla if that (take off all your armor, then you get 5% of that). A tank would have 6000+ easy, a Tauren tank would have 6150. The 1% to dodge on NE or the 5pts of weapon skill on humans made them much better thanks. Orcs had 5pts of Axe Spec, but there weren't any tanking axes IIRC, so most used swords anyway.<br />
<br />
While Horde may have had one or two fights that were better, Paladins simply destroyed Shaman in vanilla raiding. They tried so hard to balance the two classes but couldn't, which is why they eventually caved and gave both sides Shaman and Pallies, because frankly there was no other way to do it. Also, IIRC at the time forums were full of people asying they'd rage quit over that too. So at least one thing has remained consistent across all 10 years of the game. ;)</div></div><hr />

Are you new to the game? I witnessed the stampede to humans during WotLK (EMFH) and while I didn't see the stampede during later expansions to Horde for PVE reasons, it is a real thing.<br />

That's really unlikely. They're doing it to increase the relative value of the Digital Deluxe Editions by making their availability limited, like the Collector's Editions.<br />

Not really. I still see a shelf full of MoP Collector's Edition boxes in many big box stores.<br />

Are you under the impression that Blessing of Might was the only PVE advantage? There was only that and Blessing of Salvation for -30% threat on the whole raid, Blessing of Wisdom for 30mp5 (?), and Blessing of Light for those uber Flash of Lights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was the biggest advantage and only one that wasn't ultimately l2p issue. Alliance racials and paladin allowed slacking, but when played at top level, neither decided the world first races.<br />
<br />
And while dodge and sword skill may seem better on paper, on those servers at the time, HP was the king, and tauren was preferred.</div></div><hr />

Blizz didn't kill snapshotting, addons did (AfflicDots anyone?). They even said there is zero skill in snapshots when you can have an addon TELLING YOU when to refresh dots rather than keeping track of buffs yourself.</div></div><hr />

You have very selective memory. In Vanilla there definitely were a few very good (if not exceptional) Horde raiding guilds, but Alliance guilds dominated the top 25. The numbers were like 23 of the first 25 kills of Rags, Blackwing, Cthun and KT went to the Alliance. <br />
<br />
The entire WoW Raid Forums was full of Horde complaining about the massive advantages Alliance had, and playing both factions at the time, it was hard to argue with them.</div></div><hr />

You cant use WOTF directly after trinket use ether, you get a cd on it, and oh´in pve? humans 2min racial that breaks every cc vs Undeads (3min) fear breakers... hmmm so fair it hurts little one!
