I was doing them in order and was able to see every note until I got to sha. I did it on lfr and couldn't see the note then went in on heroic and it wasn't there either. Hope I didn't bug it out because that would suck :\ don't want to do immerseus again takes so long.</div></div><hr />

I'm about to go and get it - but I really feel guilty for getting an awesome mount off their labour...<br />
<br />
the thing is the people who go and find it are not a &quot;team&quot; it is hundreds of people all working together to scour every inch of the zone, so kinda unfair to give it to the lucky person for lucky few who found the final part, and not all the hundreds of others who slowly brute forced the others<br />
<br />
hell for the one after uldum i did both Aq raids and scoured every milimeter of the instances looking for any pages<br />

How do people even solve such secrets for the first time? Like how do you even know that you're on the right track?<br />
<br />
well people find something then get curious and to be fair page 1 and 2 are not super dificult to come by<br />

Usually crap happening in Kun-Lai. people sitting on the item. Not that blizzard cares, apparently if you pay your sub griefing others is fine.<br />
<br />
Have they used collision detection on items (can't recall)? And if they have how could thay not see this kind of thing happening (especially after Kosumoth).<br />
<br />
1. its not time gated so you dont have to do it now... you can come back later when less people are going after it<br />
2. its 10000000% optional, its a mount, nothing more, nothing less, so again you dont need to do it right now<br />

They should've just made that mount for underwater use only.. atleast the swimming animation isn't total dogshit.<br />
<br />
do you like the flying dragons from pandaria?<br />

I know ... I just feel they should get a reward for giving me an awesome mount. That's all.<br />
<br />
and how will it dictate who did? i mean, hundreds if not thousands of people yes they whent to help but never found a page, as said above i spent a good 2 hours around AQ cause<br />
<br />
tomb (Cthun died in a tomb like area)<br />
plume (I was thinking possibly something to do with the temple idk)<br />
and scarab moon (well scarabs all over, and cthun is a giant eyeball, aswell as there is some moons around on their art)<br />
<br />
i didnt get a page, but i helped by being able to say &quot;checked all over AQ nothing here&quot;</div></div><hr />

Actually, quite the contrary, I think Blizzard should do a better job of advertising when they have a hidden puzzle in the game.<br />
<br />
The hunt itself can be really fun, but if all the info sharing happens on dev Twitters, Discord and fansite subforums, it's pretty much a guarantee that only dedicated collectors will find out in time to participate. Everyone else will just find out from the mmo-champ front page or from one of the players showing the mount off in game and that's that, no fun for them.<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it be a lot cooler if the first clue for such mounts came in the patch announcement, or if there was an annual &quot;Secret Hunting&quot; event every year where such items could be introduced?</div></div><hr />

Firelands is a synch to solo and so is normal Siege (The first boss just takes time)<br />
<br />
The only problem is that the books are incredibly tiny and people can be arseholes and mount hug the books also if you are on a pvp server well GL!<br />
<br />
Apart from that it was easy and expect to see this mount become VERY common!</div></div><hr />

Honestly if they didn't want to share to make it easier for other people, they could have simply not published the walk through.</div></div><hr />

They'd have had to work on it in a different voice channel then as people were simply listening and reporting results.</div></div><hr />

You just won the bitchiest comment of the month! you answered all the right criteria:<br />
<br />
1) bitched about something that was free and required zero effort.<br />
2) thought you were prosecuted intentionally and even generalized your &quot;type&quot; of people.<br />
3) mentioned your &quot;rights&quot; as a paying customer.<br />
<br />
Round of applause to Vegas82 everyone! See you next month.</div></div><hr />

I don't have the issue, I have a friend who does and can't ride the mount because of it. Blizz has had this issue in the past and had to address it as well. Apparently they didn't learn their lesson. Oh, and it required effort to solve the riddles, I never included myself in shit or claimed prosecution(you probably meant persecuted) and I didn't mention shit about a customer's rights. Might want to brush up on those reading skills...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell, everyone knows damned good and well now that it is outlined how to do it people will just complain about having to go to 9 spots to do it. You can't win, and honestly Blizzard really should make things exclusive to those who do put in the time instead of caving. It is open world PvE content, and casuals put in more time than anyone, yet can't be bothered to play the game they're logged into. Someone had the time, and they did it, why not reward them over those who refuse for no other reason than &quot;because reasons&quot;.<br />

Actually, quite the contrary, I think Blizzard should do a better job of &quot;advertising&quot; when they have a &quot;hidden&quot; puzzle in the game<br />
<br />
Wouldn't that defeat the purpose?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coconut</div><div class="date">2017-05-02, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wouldn't that defeat the purpose?<br />
<br />
No, I mean they should say something like &quot;The Mind-Seekers have hidden a secret in game. How soon will it be found?&quot; in the patch notes, so that more people know there's something to look for.<br />
<br />
Otherwise this is just an event for the 3.000 or so people who are tuned in during the 48 hours after the first clue is found (I'm not salty, I was one of them, it was fun - I'm just saying it would be even better if more people got a chance to take part).</div></div><hr />
