Blue Posts<br />
Amount of Feedback<br />
However the question is, are we as a community getting enough feedback, back from Blizzard. <br />
What is it that you would like to hear more from us about? We regularly communicate on the hot topics that we see on the forums, however we want to ensure that we don't detract from the feedback that is being given in a particular thread. We especially don't want to end up derailing a good discussion simply by being present, or by what we bring to the discussion. Sometimes it's better for us to let a topic run its course as this is at heart a community forum for you guys to discuss the game.<br />
<br />
Once in a very long while there comes a blue, sits down and chats with the community for a while about a certain topic in a thread. And that's great. But how often does that happen? <br />
I personally try to jump in here to chat with you all on a regular basis, just as the other Community team members do. Remember that the work that the community team does isn't solely about posting on the forums, in fact posting here on the forums and on social media is just one small part of the job that we do. <br />
<br />
But when you make it seem like your feedback doesn't matter or isn't heard, then people kind of lose motivation to continue their feedback. <br />
A blue post in a thread is not intended as a way for us to show that a thread has been read, our posts are simply that, posts. We read every thread possible and we relay the feedback that you give back to the developers, they even read the forums and your feedback themselves. Understand that your feedback does matter to us, in fact every voice matters to us, it's one of our core values. Don't lose that motivation to provide quality feedback as it does help to make World of Warcraft a better game for everyone.<br />
<br />
More blue posts would be lovely, but what I'd really like to see is more time and dedication from Blizzard. Even something as simple as &quot;We agree that warriors are a little over the top at the moment but want to wait and see how they play out when players are fully geared.&quot; or something like that you know? Just like you tell us, &quot;all of your feedback matters, keep it coming!&quot;, we are saying this right back at you! <br />
I actually made a similar post about Blood Death Knights recently saying that we're aware of the difficulties players are facing against them. On the topic of Warriors, we're aware that Warrior participation numbers have increased, but this is mainly due to the changes in 5.4. Warriors also scale incredibly well with weapons, which many players have recently gotten and all of this means a lot of players are trying the class out, or have gone back to a Warrior that they'd stopped playing previously, and so on. <br />
<br />
We are keeping an eye on Warrior performance, but don't want to nerf them if it turns out to be unnecessary.<br />
<br />
Sit down and chat with us about all the different issues that are going on. Keep us up to date about what the developers are up to. It makes us feel like we and our voices matter <br />
Your voices do matter greatly to us, and we try to sit down and chat with you all whenever we can. Be sure to remember that the feedback you provide is of great importance to us and if you wish to even provide any about the Community team and its members performance or interactions, including mine, then please do so by sending an email to CMFeedback-EN@Blizzard.com<br />
<br />
To quell the comments about Warriors in this thread before they get out of hand; I in no way said that Warriors as a class are fine or perfectly balanced. I also didn't say that we wouldn't be making changes to them due to their current state.<br />
<br />
My post simply stated some of the reasons for the increased participation numbers that we've been seeing from Warriors as a class in Arena. I also said that we're watching the performance of the Warrior class closely and we'll make changes if required. We will make a change for Warriors, but that's more in the spirit of making Arena more enjoyable, rather than as a direct nerf to the class. The main thing that we don't want to do is nerf the class unnecessarily or too much to avoid another issue. <br />
<br />
I don't care how popular they are, there is no reason why Warrior representation should be higher than that of all other melee specs combined.<br />
Representation is not an indicator for class strength, but more for the classes popularity. Class strength is of course a factor in its popularity, but it isn't the be all and end all.

Hunter Pet Bug<br />
Thanks for letting us know about this particular issue. This is an issue where hunters are able to increase the power of their pets and deal rather large amounts of damage in a short period. I'm happy to let you all know that we are aware of this and have managed to create a hotfix that should solve the problem. We very recently applied this fix to the game and it should take effect once your realm is restarted, so you shouldn't be encountering Hunter pets with extremely powerful attacks for long.

We pretty much saw all that was left of Outland (or Draenor) in TBC, if we are indeed going back there, and this is indeed a WoW expansion (still sure it's a HS expansion, but never mind that), it would most likely involve time travel and alternate timelines, since all the Timewalker speculation seems to add up to that. Oh and since Garrosh as this point just needs a moustache and a cape, stealing a time-travel device seems to fit his new comic-book villain agenda quite fine.</div></div><hr />

I agree, I'm still 95% sure that WoD is a HS expansion, but if it's not, then sure, I was wrong. We'll all know in what, 4 days anyways.</div></div><hr />

Why would a non-released game need an expansion trademark this early?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Starcraft 2 had trademarked it's expansions before it was released. Also, since Hearthstone is loosely based around the WoW TCG (which had the title &quot;Heroes of Azeroth&quot;, where as Hearthstone is called &quot;Heroes of Warcraft&quot;), it makes sense since the first TCG expansion was called &quot;Through the Dark Portal&quot;, which along with the &quot;Warlords&quot; obviously being a reference to the before mentioned &quot;Heroes&quot;, all adds up. Well, that and the fact that the trademark is worded a lot differently than even the MoP one, with references of tablets, cellphones and the lack of the usual mousepad - of course this is all my guess, which could be 100% wrong obviously.</div></div><hr />

...<br />
No. We're done with Outland. There is nothing more to explore there. It's a chunk of a planet shattered and stuck somewhere in between of Great Dark Beyond and Twisting Nether.<br />
Not right now in any case. And since it's clearly stating Draenor, and we're getting a lot of hints about timelines being a mess, I guess we're going back in time to when Draenor was a whole thing, not torn apart by Ner'zul and his portals.<br />
But at the same time it wouldn't make much sense lorewise because there was not elves, gnomes, undead, trolls and others over there in the past, Orcs and maybe Draeneis, depends on a time period.<br />
<br />
Or maybe there is some new developments happening on Outland. Or maybe WoD has nothing to do with WoW at all. We'll see in just a couple of days.</div></div><hr />

Issue 1: The &quot;heroes&quot; of outlands are all either accounted for or dead aside from the big two, Turalyon and Alleria. Will we get to see an Alliance fist pump bad ass expansion based around these two heroes? God and Blizzard only know at this point.<br />
<br />
Issue 2: I believe it was in one of the spin off books when Thrall was getting his shaman training, The Shattering or the one before it where he was informed that Outland is basically doomed due to the warping of Netherstorm gaining more ground than the Ethereal tera-forming can keep up with and using entirely too much energy to keep up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice<br />
<br />
But since there has been so many 'fk logic' moments with Blizzard we could<br />
<br />
1. See something about Turalyon/Alleria and new characters/race that they encountered while they went through the dark portal to other worlds<br />
<br />
2. Since we now have 'panda tech + lore' access maybe they found a new way to help outlands or some other race from outer space were following the Draenei (Space Cows?) offered to fix outlands.<br />
<br />
I think the answer will be coming this week end either way right?</div></div><hr />

If I recall correctly, Mists of Pandaria also had the tablet, handheld, and phone piece in it. It's generic language that covers all bases for mobile apps, people playing on tablet PCs, etc.</div></div><hr />

You sir are the one with the unchecked brain imho. If they did not trademark it for mibile devices an someone else would. Then they cant update the mobile armory to that expansion!</div></div><hr />

I think you're the one that has something odd growing on your brain... <br />
<br />
A lot of people in these foruns needs to sit down for a little bit and learn how trademark linguistics work.<br />
<br />
By saying that a digital property that is being trademarked has tablet pc, handheld and cellphone rights attached to it DOES NOT IMPLY it will have them when said product gets released. It just gets covered by the same global trademark, in case they feel like doing so in the future they don't need to file a 2nd trademark.<br />
<br />
Plus, you know, the armory, gchat and whatnot have been available for cellphones and handhelds for ages now. Nowhere in the trademark it states it is the entire digital product that is on the cellphone, just something relaed to the trademark.<br />
<br />
Guys... c'mon... wake up.</div></div><hr />

Looks to be the case, the Mists and Cataclysm TMs have no reference for those devices. I know I've seen that used for another MMO in the last year or two, but it escapes me which it was. The point still stands though, they've talked about a pet battle app, they already have the armory app that needs updated, tablet PCs can play WoW as-is, and handhelds could refer to game streaming things like nVidia Shield.<br />
<br />
That said, the only other possibility folks are tossing out is an expansion for Hearthstone. However, Hearthstone's trademark has no references for those devices either, and given Hearthstone is still in Closed Beta, I find it very unlikely it'll be a Hearthstone expansion announcement already. It would be very strange to lock in such a unique name so far in advance when the base game isn't even out.<br />
<br />
Given the only new trademarks (that are live and not dead) for Blizzard are Reaper of Souls and Warlords of Draenor, my money is solidly on WoD being the WoW expansion, for good or bad. Once they announce the name, if they don't have it locked up in the major countries, it'll be much harder to secure it. The Dark Below never went beyond application phase, and as Boub pointed out with Corgis Unleashed, literally anyone could file an application as Blizzard, it just wouldn't go beyond the application phase.<br />
<br />
It's the 11th hour, and the only name we have that would work for the new WoW expansion is Warlords of Draenor.</div></div><hr />

-There is more to Outland simply because you just see one fragment of a world does not mean others do not exist.<br />
-The timewalkers bring us back in time like may speculate which I think is a possibility as well, makes sense with all the Timewalkers in the last TCG block having this same thing happen then next thing we know they show up in game with an Isle etc etc<br />
-We get a mixture of both<br />
<br />
Point is the last blizzcon they said that Turalyon would appear but in the expansion after MoP. Turalyon is in outlands somewhere so I thought well how are we going to find him? Oh go back in time deal with stuff and find him in the future as well because we would learn where he went. Nonetheless we will just have to wait for Blizzcon to roll around to find out what exactly it is. Could be an xpac, could be a Hearthstone thing, who knows. Point is wait to blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

Isn't anyone the least bit suspicious about it? Everyone is throwing all their eggs into the Warlords basket but they aren't thinking. Blizzard is notorious for trying to hide the names of expansions and other future content. Did anyone forget that they straight up denied Mists of Pandaria was the next expansion? Or when Worgens and Goblins were going to be the new race and the masks were leaked, they did their best to hide that too. Now, The Dark Below was trademarked a few months ago and then Corgis Unleashed soon afterwards. Because of Corgis, everyone screams fake but I would take a closer look.<br />
Typically, Blizzard trademarks games a few months prior to Blizzcon, just as they did with The Dark Below. Now, trademarking a name just a week prior to Blizzcon across different countries on a variety of days? This is all too fishy for me. Of course, tomorrow we will know the truth, but until then, I think the next expansion is The Dark Below. I may be wrong, but my instincts tell me otherwise.</div></div><hr />
