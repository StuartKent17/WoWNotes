<br />
Also, here are a few extra screenshots and artworks from the Cataclysm press kit. (Not resized because we're all going to make posters out of these artworks anyway.)<br />

Though it barely did yesterday.<br />
<br />
They reserved lots of time for WoW. Curious to see whether they re-vamp more dungeons other than onyxia.<br />
<br />
Also, the goblin faces look rather &quot;shopped&quot; in some of the screens, probably an effect caused by bad lighting filters / partially implemented.<br />
Plus, we haven't seen the worgen females yet. Perhaps today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Troll/leech questions? It was a completely reasonable question. &quot;World of Warcraft Dungeons &amp; Raids Panel&quot; is the only thing listed under Boubs streaming category and I wanted to make sure I was reading it correctly/verifying he didnt make a mistake. Seems strange they would tell everyone they would be covering more stuff in depth today yet not stream it, especially since most of the ppl who purchased the stream are really only concerned about the WoW info.</div></div><hr />

Put more question marks, you moron, and add some &quot;!!!&quot; to the end. <br />
What people want is to see *all* WoW content not part of it arbitrarily selected by blizzard and mixed with Diablo bullshit. <br />
If I pay for live coverage I would like to be able to *SELECT* which of the conference even I watch and essentially to see any of them. And if you compare how many WoW people are among subscriptors with Diablo one, this Diablo III open Q&amp;A at 11:30 instead of WoW game system and just NOTHING at 10:00 when there's WoW Q&amp;A is just spit on the face....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, even though I didn't buy the stream for this very reason. It just blows that people that payed to see the WoW panels won't even see ALL of them. Considering most people bought the stream for the pet, so they are WoW players. It's stupid to not let them see all of the WoW panels. But that's Blizzard for you...</div></div><hr />

What's being said is out of all those panels, only the dungeons and raids panel is being streamed, the others aren't which is rather silly since i thought most people buying the stream would be buying it for the wow stuff.</div></div><hr />

Less troll/leech posts like these please, also what's behind those goblin's that thing is uglier then my 2nd cousin, can't wait for more Blizzcon!!!!<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
It appears those are the Hobgoblins, though the confusion is probably due to their skin not being purple, so if you are rolling a Goblin and remember thats most likely going to be what your Pack Hobgoblin is going to look like, everytime you wanna use your racial bank access.</div></div><hr />

I was rather disappointed that the stream yesterday was only streaming one stage... and now Im even more disappointed that tomorrow, even though the Wow Q&amp;A panel is taking place on that stage, they aren't starting the stream until it ends... not to mention that 3 of the other 4 wow panels are on the wrong stage to &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
AND the stream signed off in the middle of the dance/sound-alike contests :( <br />

Things to address for the next Blizzcon I hope!</div></div><hr />

My only guess is they don't cover 100% of the Blizzcon by stream, so people who actually got to Blizzcon feel different. After all, there's a difference between $40 and the whole troubles to get there... As lame arguments like &quot;we want to give something to Diablo III players&quot; (who would play in this game with previous century graphic anyway? ) does not explain why they don't show Q&amp;A (and amything else on this timeslot).<br />
<br />

What people want is to see *all* WoW content not part of it arbitrarily selected by blizzard and mixed with Diablo bullshit. <br />
If I pay for live coverage I would like to be able to *SELECT* which of the conference even I watch and essentially to see any of them. And if you compare how many WoW people are among subscriptors with Diablo one, this Diablo III open Q&amp;A at 11:30 instead of WoW game system and just NOTHING at 10:00 when there's WoW Q&amp;A is just spit on the face.... <br />

Metzen only said things like Garrosh is pissed off and they want to put the war back in warcraft.. plus there was the concept art that Metzen said he liked that showed Thrall AND Cairne rescuing horde children from the after affects of the Cataclysm.. seems like Cairne is alive to me..</div></div><hr />

No, not at all, there's the whole bunch of idiots who are &quot;very disappointed&quot; by about anything Blizzard do, just for the sake of being disappointed. Go, develop your own game which would show them how to do it right. Or go, cancel your account and have some life. Or go and visit your doctor to help you with your masochism. You have alot of options, actually.</div></div><hr />

Given that this is a purely WoW fan site, understandable why people would be pissed off, but hey, that's TV for ya.<br />
<br />
Last i checked, all of the content information showed up later in the day, yesterday. So calm down, wait a while, im sure we'll have some fans who recorded the information, hell, maybe a video on the Panel discussions (hopefully the sound will be right) and we'll have our info later on.</div></div><hr />

not true btw... you only see the schedule now when you are loged in. you definitely did not see it a month ago when i bought my stream (guess why... hint: ohh it´s soo tricky to find that one out... even blizz did't know the schedule exactly at that time)<br />
funny how they added a new line of text to the discription today. &quot;Both days live starting 11:00 am pst&quot;... lol<br />
the thing is: it also says &quot;main stage presentation...&quot; so no 2nd stage content... but could someone who bought the stream some days ago plx sue for the open wow Q&amp;A on the main stage today? ^^</div></div><hr />

Regarding the stram - I really don't get why Blizzard don't show 10:00AM Q&amp;A. And for my money I want - at least - to hear about the reasoning behind it. If they don't have a good reason, this is just PLAIN STUPID to annoy community that much.</div></div><hr />

Where do the allies WIN?!<br />
I think we should take over an area of Silverpine (seems a logical second way to go for Worgen), then they could turn the Alterac Valley queue area into a real quest hub, same way as the horde city in Arathi, and it would expand into the game. Just give the alliance something! We finally get a badass leader and he's not going to win us any battles?<br />
On the other hand, Im curious about the impact on a few areas... Burning Steppes, Searing Gorge, will they become more burning and more searing? Or will they get some life as well? And Deathwing is passing through Wetlands, will Wetlands dry up?</div></div><hr />

Watching the Low setting has got horrid buffing issues atm. :-\</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pokchop</div><div class="date">2009-08-23, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They did include the Game Systems panel (they recorded it and played it between SC2 gameplay panel and closing ceremony). So besides the morning Q&amp;A, the art panel, and the second Class Panel we didn't miss out on much.<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A? Seriously, all lame questions. I cringe at Q&amp;A. People asking dumb questions that they could've answered themselves or asking something that isn't likely going to be answered. Or stupid crap like why'd you nerf me? It's like WoW Forums Live.<br />
<br />
Art panel not going to be missed. There wasn't much else to the second class panel IMO.<br />
<br />
So yeah I watched the whole stream and got all the new WoW information from whatever panels we got.<br />
<br />
Anyway if you watched the stream just for WoW then you should've just waited for MMO-Champ to post the relevant info. If you're like me that enjoys Diablo and SC too, then it was all good. Really enjoyed the Monk reveal, definitely my new favorite Diablo class after the Barb.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumps</div><div class="date">2009-08-24, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is starting to worry me is that MMO history has taught us that every time a company radically redesigns the game (like Blizzard is now doing) it spells the end of the game. One need to look no farther than UO with AoS, DAoC with TOA and SOE SWG to see that radical redesigns normally don't work out nearly as well as they sound like they are going to.<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing is the others change things out of desperation. Blizzard (at least old blizzard) changes things out of creative overflow of ideas. The only thing I'm worried about is that they destroy my favorite old world areas - and of course that they prevent us AGAIN from using the flying mounts... but apart from that it sounds interesting.</div></div><hr />
