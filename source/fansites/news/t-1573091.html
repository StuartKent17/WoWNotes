Our friends over at Vanion (http://www.vanion.eu/world-of-warcraft/news/video-interview-mit-lead-game-designer-tom-chilton-zu-warlords-of-draenor/10896/) had the chance to talk to Tom Chilton during Gamescom and came away with some interesting details.

<br />
Final Boss<br />
<br />
Grommash (http://wowpedia.org/Grom_Hellscream) is the final boss of Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Legendary Items<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor will have a questline for a legendary ring that begins at level 99 and is less grindy than the Mists of Pandaria quests. <br />
The legendary ring will have a visual effect so that players can show it off.<br />
It is very likely that there will be legendary items other than the ring from the questline.<br />
<br />
<br />
Future Content Patches<br />
<br />
A transmogrification system revamp could be part of Patch 6.1 or 6.2, allowing you to build a collection of transmog items rather than storing them in your bank or Void Storage. It also may include tools to better manage multiple transmog sets. <br />
Tanaan Jungle and possibly Farahlon (http://wowpedia.org/Farahlon) will be in future content patches, not at launch.<br />
Additional dungeons could be added in content patches. There are more dungeons within Draenor that could be added, as well as older dungeons through the Timewalker system (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3491-Character-Level-Scaling-Feature-Connected-Realm-Updates-and-Feedback-Blue-Tweets). <br />
There aren't any class quests planned for Warlords launch right now, but if one fits later in the expansion it could be added.<br />
The length of time beyond Patch 6.1 that you are unable to fly in Draenor will be decided upon by the community as a whole. If players enjoy it then it could last longer. If players overwhelming want flight back by Patch 6.1, then they will most likely get it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords Patch Timing<br />
<br />
The Warlords patch cycle will be similar to the Mists of Pandaria patch cycle, but some of it will depend on the timing of the next expansion. <br />
<br />
&quot;Some of it will depend on the time before the next expansion after Warlords. It is very possible that if we are successful and there is a shorter gap, then we won't necessarily want to have multiple raid tier content patches. Each raid content patch needs about four months to breathe. Any less than that and it feels like you really rushed through the content.&quot;<br />
<br />
The content patch schedule isn't finalized yet, as a lot of it depends on what players want to see more of once they get through the launch content. Some of it will depend on the scheduling for the next expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
The team would like to add the new Nagrand arena as a new arena, but this isn't final yet. It depends on how work on the next expansion is progressing. <br />
There are no plans to add a new battleground in Warlords of Draenor. <br />
<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
<br />
Garrisons ended up involving all of the different teams and will be a big feature, changing the gameplay of WoW more than any other feature has.<br />
More Garrison features or levels are something that could be done in a future content patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
The Adventure Guide won't make it in for the Warlords launch. It will be useful as more content is added after launch, so hopefully it will be ready for a future content patch.<br />
The World of Warcraft team grew by around 80 people during Mists of Pandaria, which should allow them to produce content faster in the future. This did slow things down in the short term though, which contributed to the delay of Warlords of Draenor. <br />
There aren't any scenarios for you to queue for at Level 100 in Warlords right now, but some could be added in future patches. Right now they are mostly used as a storytelling tool while leveling.<br />
Warforged items can appear in dungeons now as a nice bonus.</div></div><hr />

Turns out to be an orc.<br />
<br />
Pretty much what was expected.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's promo double speak is the stuff of conmen and nervous developers hoping to keep Rome from falling.<br />
<br />
Also Patch 6.X will introduce more content that should have been implemented as part of the expansion.<br />
<br />
I hate that the 500 lb. Gorilla that is Blizzard has kept this treadmill of &quot;what you see is not what you get&quot; going, instead of reinvigorating us with more sandbox inspired content.<br />
<br />
Listen to the Gamescom interview. Google half the sales pitch he gives. Be shocked and amazed to find out how much of this garbage was spewed with Pandaria (particularly the speed of expansions).</div></div><hr />

The version of Tanaan that includes the Portal Event is essentially a big instance. The Tanaan Jungle with the Dark Portal destroyed and the Iron Horde trying to rebuild it will be in a content patch.</div></div><hr />

I'm not usually one to be picky about all the development shenanigans but this worries me a bit. I don't like even the possibility of Farahlon not being a thing at all in the expension.</div></div><hr />

Tanaan Jungle still has the intro questes, but they are just for abt half of lvl 90-91. (as far as I've seen)<br />
So it's not the full zone.</div></div><hr />

Why not? They spoiled Garrosh as the final boss of MoP very early on, I don't see why they couldn't do the same with Grom.</div></div><hr />

The introductory experience goes through Tanaan and revolves around the dark portal (east Tanaan), but the &quot;rest of the zone&quot; will be a max level area revolving around the iron citadel.</div></div><hr />

Let alone the latest 'trailer' for WoD is amusing.<br />
All they have to show is the zones, dungeons, raids, garrisons and character models.<br />
eep.<br />

Mostly it's about a fairly non-legendary ring?<br />
<br />
I'm fine with the ring as long as it has the kind of stats you'd expect from something like, say, leggins or a chest. It's better than a cloak which meant other cloaks were always useless. Hopefully they will keep the ring numbers down on the last tier but I'm sure that's what we will token up when we really want a trinket.</div></div><hr />

Well I hope that's not a problem. I actually find the mentality behind the &quot;LFR Legendary&quot; of the Addon makes quite some sense. It's a Ring. You can have two of them so it doesn't trivialize a whole fucking slot, like the cloaks did. It won't affect Transmog at all.. I pretty much like the idea. As long as they keep their Idea of doing Hardcore (I suppose Mythic only) Legendaries too. That SHOULD (ah, who am I joking) stop all the stupid whining.. &quot;Bah Legendaries too easy&quot; - Spoiled Hardcore child // &quot;Bah, Mythic only? But..

We've all been reading for years how blizzard have been trying to get content and expansions finished sooner (since those months and months of grinding ICC). <br />
<br />
- Cataclysm took too long to release (not enough filler content between ICC and Cata OR they shouldve paced the release of their Raids better in WOLTK).<br />
- They tried AGAIN at getting things done sooner with MoP, but ultimately they didnt want to release an unfinished product. We end up in Dragon Soul for months and months again.<br />
- MoP comes and raids are paced just right. Now they finally look to be getting the next expac completed (WoD) on time but at a cost of removing a lot of the originally intended features (for later release) and not much depth at all (no new BG, no new scenarios, only 4 lvl 100 dungeons, etc).<br />
<br />
It seems they've been making a concerted effort to get things release earlier since the days of ICC and personally, I'd rather wait a bit longer and get a better expansion on release. If they could just add more content and space their raids out a bit more, then the wait wouldnt be so bad. For example, another 25 man boss (ala Helion - Ruby Sanctum) and a couple of 5 mans (with 535 ilvl loot - another way for alts to gear) and I wouldnt mind waiting until 2015 for WoD.<br />
<br />
Seems there is no easy answer. You either rush and end up with an average product (to be perfected at a later date) or you take you're time perfecting the product in return for a later release date. Which would you prefer?<br />
<br />
Oh and, so dissapointed with Grammosh as the end boss after they said it WONT be a Warlord. Even if hes transformed by the legion, thats the same shit as we just had.</div></div><hr />

The Warlords patch cycle will be similar to the Mists of Pandaria patch cycle, but some of it will depend on the timing of the next expansion. <br />
&quot;Some of it will depend on the time before the next expansion after Warlords. It is very possible that if we are successful and there is a shorter gap, then we won't necessarily want to have multiple raid tier content patches. Each raid content patch needs about four months to breathe. Any less than that and it feels like you really rushed through the content.&quot;<br />
The content patch schedule isn't finalized yet, as a lot of it depends on what players want to see more of once they get through the launch content. Some of it will depend on the scheduling for the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Anyone else read that and think oh..look maybe only 3 patches and a year of waiting for the next expansion.....<br />
<br />
I knew this was going to be a glorified Cata 2.0, nice landscape and all wrapped in a very tiny package of content. They are leaving it up to the player base as to whether or not flying comes back, this the whole 6.1 crap, was actually double speak crap. this seem pretty typical now and they were suppose to be changing their ways and want content to last, yea it going to last alright, best take it slow boys and girls because does not look like to much fruit is dropping out of the tree on this expansion. We are going the let the player base actually dictate what they like to see in future patches that will take months to develop, so you best go slow is what I read out of all that.</div></div><hr />

Orcs seem to be the main lifeform that lives and controls most of Draenor. Grommash is a major lore character, so much more than his son. Wait till we see what they actually do with it before whining. Hell even I'm a little disappointed but I'm still gonna play. As far as legendary ring, so what if its not something you can see, its still something to strive for, don't like it, same as game then don't go for it.

THIS THIS THIS<br />
<br />
This is the the proof that virtually every one of you whiners on here are talking out of your ass. You built an entire temper tantrum on a lie and none of you even thought to look it up. IIRC does not equal fact. <br />
<br />
You whine about the possibility of zone being cut and that would have never happened back in the day, but Arak was cut from TBC and underground spider zone from WotLK, the two xpacs that are generally cited as the right way to do things. <br />
<br />
You whine about the welfare legendary being a ring. But welfare legendaries should be things like rings. Chilton basically said that it opens up the possibility for legendaries like the way they were in the past. <br />
<br />
You even have the nerve to whine that he's saying &quot;we'll see&quot; and &quot;maybe&quot; when the only reason he's doing that is to cater to you, the whiners, who consider every thought or idea a promise. How do I know this? Cause he literally said it in this interview.<br />
<br />
The only tragedy of this entire expansion, is that if I wanna see the latest news, I have to go to websites and see the misinformed, self-entitled, and flat-out ignorant whinings of a vocal minority that represents the worst of the player base. <br />
<br />
Beyond that, this is clearly the most aggressive and ambitious undertaking the WoW team has ever attempted. I like hearing that they've got all kinds of ideas, but will wait to see player reaction before committing to any. I like that they're willing to be honest with us, even in the face of all this abuse. <br />
<br />
My only wish is that all of those that constantly threaten to un-sub (or lie that they did yet are still on these forums) would stop bluffing, do the game a favour and take your ignorance over to another game.</div></div><hr />

Look at the bright side its the Twilight's Hammer join forces with the Horde...... wait ... its Wrathon teaming up with a hellscream...... wait didn't we have those as enemies last two expansions? oh .... the bright side is instead of the final boss being a hellscream everyone hates, its a hellscream everyone loves.</div></div><hr />

didn't he also say the time between the final patch of an expansion and the expansion will less, and here we are with MoP and it being biggest gap for any expansion. I think we need to think about it this way, what ever blizzard tells us its the opposite.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How are people reading this part of the quote do we think? I mean, my reading of it is that, if they're able to speed up development of the next expansion, they're considering only having a single (i.e. not multiple) raid tier content patch? That, alongside the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
Each raid content patch needs about four months to breathe.<br />
<br />
Might even imply they're looking at a sub-12 month expansion cycle this time round?<br />
<br />
I appreciate that sounds completely mental, and I can't believe that would be the plan, but it's an interesting thought, no?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Garrosh already wasn't that epic final boss so Grommash is probably just the next disappointment in the series.. Like son like father, well Grommash is actually lot more iconic, but still not an epic antagonist.<br />
Might be fun to see some of the lore that dates pre-wow sort of.<br />
Gul'dan is going to be the most interesting out of these savages, since he has a cunning mind, instead of hulk-smash-everything agenda. <br />
Just wish they could have actually gone back in time and mix in Medivh also. <br />
<br />
But in the end Blizz really pulled a rabbit out of the hat and has a lot of other nice additions and tweaks in storage for Warlords so going to Draenor doesn't feel that big of a setback it seems.<br />
Stat squish, new models, a lot of redesign in the classes.. Old raids still got a lot of going through to be done, at least for one more expansion time span, fun to see how the new stat system works there.<br />
Oh well doesn't matter it's all heading towards Sargeras eventually, you can prolong the journey but that's what everyone wants to see there's no denying it, they just have to fill the path there with something like these 10 in a dozen mobs like the Hellscream family. Oh and the Horde must have their expansions too, allies already got Lich King and Illidan, share DW so why not put in the Hellscreams and then Sargeras to end the world.. of Warcraft. Literally. There's no happy ending. Defeat all of these epic bosses and then Sargeras comes and one Finger of death and byebye Azeroth.<br />
<br />
C'mon Queen Azshara for the 7.0. Unite the world against a real threat instead of this war humptydumpty, End of Mists was sort of like a truce first time in a long while, but here we go again.. Just put King Varian and the orcs on a closed island and let them battle it up. Vol'jin is a relaxed guy, Varian is stubborn as hell, i think alliance needs an election.</div></div><hr />

Like WTF DO YOU WANT, LOL. I guess it always has to be a weapon. In my opinion, out of all the gear that isn't a weapon, jewelry has the biggest appeal for a legendary, unless you're just basing your opinion off the fact that it's not a big flashy model on our character. The &quot;9 set&quot; t3 piece off KT in Naxx 40 was a ring. And we actually get to see it on our finger now...People will complain about literally anything. <br />
<br />
And for the record...they said we start the quest at 99 and it's not as grindy as the cloak was...and there's very likely other things we'll get...now I have to ask you...do you actually think it's going to be the one and only legendary in the entire expansion after reading this?<br />
<br />
And I'm so glad everyone knows that the last boss is just a simple, plain old orc. As if they're not going to make it epic as fuck. Not to mention the fact that it's Grom Hellscream, a legendary lore figure we would never get to see if they didn't do this expansion. &quot;Oh filler expansion!&quot; Brb getting to see and interact with all the old lore heroes always being talked about but never being seen in World of Warcraft...taking WoW back to it's roots. These are probably the same people complaining about MoP and how it wasn't Warcrafty enough. <br />
<br />
I'm also so glad that people are telling Blizzard how the lore needs to go for their own game and story. Like &quot;that's not how it goes!&quot;. Uhh, yeah actually, it is. If they want to strap a 9ft dildo on Grom's head, they can and you have no choice but to say it's part of the lore.</div></div><hr />

Also while it may seem repetitive, we have no idea how this story plays out at all nor how the encounter will be in the slightest. So before blowing the rage horn and freaking out, let the expansion play out and maybe enjoy the epic story they've laid out for us! As someone who has played warcraft from the beginning and loves the lore, they couldn't have made a cooler expansion! This is like wow 2.0 to me a chance to relive the old lore with a bit of a twist seeing characters like grom, durotan, and kargath in an mmo setting has me very excited. Maybe save your premature raging until that content patch comes out and if it plays just like garrosh then by all means rage on</div></div><hr />

<br />
On top of that, having two expansions revolve around Hellscreams just feels incredibly uninspiring especially after having dealt with Garrosh for what will be 14 months once Warlords is released. I like Orcs, I do, master race and all, but this is simply far too awful. <br />
<br />
I just don't buy it and call red herring on Grom.<br />
<br />
<br />
The World of Warcraft team grew by around 80 people during Mists of Pandaria, which should allow them to produce content faster in the future. This did slow things down in the short term though, which contributed to the delay of Warlords of Draenor.<br />

That's such a load of bullshit that my eyes almost stayed in a perpetual rolling motion. We've all heard this before, many times, even from the big guy Mike himself and look what happened, longest content drought in history of WoW.</div></div><hr />

The Warlords patch cycle will be similar to the Mists of Pandaria patch cycle, but some of it will depend on the timing of the next expansion. <br />
&quot;Some of it will depend on the time before the next expansion after Warlords. It is very possible that if we are successful and there is a shorter gap, then we won't necessarily want to have multiple raid tier content patches. Each raid content patch needs about four months to breathe. Any less than that and it feels like you really rushed through the content.&quot;<br />
The content patch schedule isn't finalized yet, as a lot of it depends on what players want to see more of once they get through the launch content. Some of it will depend on the scheduling for the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Anyone else read that and think oh..look maybe only 3 patches and a year of waiting for the next expansion.....<br />
<br />
I think Blizzards goal is to get closer to Activision's general strategy of yearly releases for their major properties. If you can release a new expansions more often, you relieve a lot of pressure to create large mid-expansion content packages, you can retain active subscriptions for longer, and you can have powerful hooks to return more often)<br />
<br />
If a raid tier lasts a minimum of 4 months (and could reasonably stay fresh for 5-6), then a yearly release would require 2 raid tiers (one at release, one 6 months later). Pad that out with a couple smaller patches for non-raid content (the way they did with 4.1/5.1 &amp; 5.3) and you have a game that doesn't get stale, and at the same time is tapping your players for paid expansions more often. <br />
<br />
The truth is that WoW subscription numbers will continue to slowly decline (the game is old). When you have declining revenues from subscriptions, it gets harder and harder to use that for content development as opposed to just ongoing game costs. If you can have a boxed product, you're going to get a nice boost in revenue and you can more than cover your development costs.<br />
<br />
Increasing development speed also increases the rate that they can make the sort of sweeping changes to the game that they tend to save for new expansions.<br />
<br />
If you are bristling at their idea of moving to more frequent expansion releases, its helpful to think of the cost of an expansion vs the cost of a subscription. If you played MoP for 2 years, you paid $40 for the expansion and $350 for the subscription ($390/24 = $16.25/mo). If they do yearly $50 expansions, your cost is ($100+350 = $450/24 = $18.75/mo). So the increase in cost isn't that much, and you get the benefit of a full content (new continent/zones, classes, races, etc.) refresh annually, and you aren't going to be stuck raiding the same content for a year at the end of each expansion.<br />
<br />
Whether they can achieve this remains to be seen, but have no doubt that it's their ultimate goal.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dazu</div><div class="date">2014-08-15, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also remember they added a new raid technology which was only meant to come in with this expansion with flex.

Most of the fun is doing group activity with friends while joking on vent etc. I can still go do Vaults and have fun if im doing it with friends, getting them killed or laughing at them for failing a mechanic etc. We dont know what will be added during the course of the expansion, so saying the expansion is only XX dungeons/raids etc is blatantly wrong as the expansion includes everything added until the next expansion.

I actually find the mentality behind the &quot;LFR Legendary&quot; of the Addon makes quite some sense. It's a Ring. You can have two of them so it doesn't trivialize a whole fucking slot, like the cloaks did. It won't affect Transmog at all.. I pretty much like the idea. As long as they keep their Idea of doing Hardcore (I suppose Mythic only) Legendaries too. That SHOULD (ah, who am I joking) stop all the stupid whining.. &quot;Bah Legendaries too easy&quot; - Spoiled Hardcore child // &quot;Bah, Mythic only? But.. I can't afk that thing, Blizz what the hell?!&quot; - Spoiled LFR Brat.<br />
<br />
Legendaries were never difficult, they were always about getting lucky, or being the favored DPS in some guild. So acting elitist about them is retarded. I'm glad that Blizzard is discarding that trash and moving to a more player inclusive model.<br />
<br />
The cloaks were the first iteration, and I expect that with WoD, they're going to refine the system.<br />
<br />
The basic idea will be a legendary item that includes an expansion-spanning quest/storyline for the individual player. For the cloaks, we worked with Wrathion, delved into some lore, had some decent solo content, and tied it into each raid tier and content patch. What made the cloak less legendary wasn't that everyone ended up with them, it was that much of it was tied up in collecting random, useless raid drops.<br />
<br />
I think for WoD, I think they're going to do less of the collecting stuff, and more of the solo player content.<br />
<br />
Heroic/Mythic raiding already gets the best rewards in the form of exclusive mounts, titles, gear (WoD), etc. They don't need separate legendaries.</div></div><hr />

Now look at MoP. You finish the last quest. You talk to wrathion and the cloak is in your inventory. Yay I guess? Legendaries have gone the way of epics, they're not legendary, they're not a rarity, they're handed out to everyone. Give us something on the same scale as Thunderfury, or the Warglaives or Shadowmourne!

The truth is that WoW subscription numbers will continue to slowly decline (the game is old). When you have declining revenues from subscriptions, it gets harder and harder to use that for content development as opposed to just ongoing game costs. If you can have a boxed product, you're going to get a nice boost in revenue and you can more than cover your development costs.<br />
<br />
I'd agree with you in general, but you seem to be talking in really outdated terms.<br />
<br />
A couple of facts - large part (perhaps even majority?) of Activision/Blizzard revenue around WoW is not coming from subscriptions. It's from in-game store, and THAT's the content production that they are ramping up, because it's much cheaper and yields much better $ per development time spent.<br />

How is that good? Scenarios were cool :/<br />
<br />
I mean, it's great they are being used in storytelling, they are amazing for that, but I liked the speed of scenarios. Though I guess with VP being made less important there's less reason to run them efficiently.<br />

Why the hell do they state who the final boss is of each expansion? I don't wanna know what happens at the end of the movie before I go in. Am I the only one who would like a surprise while I play once in a while lorewise?<br />
<br />
No, you aren't. I felt the Garrosh reveal before MoP came out was THE worst mistake they made with MoP.<br />
<br />
At least in this instance it's semi-obvious, but it would still have been nice to not have been sure of the end boss before hand. I like mystery. I like exploration, and knowing what's there ruins it.</div></div><hr />

Well, to be fair, it's really nothing new. WotLK would have seemed pretty stupid if it had been anyone other than the Lich King as the final boss. We knew Illidan was in Outland for TBC. We were going to Outland. It was common sense. In order for Cataclysm to happen, Deathwing had to show up. If we didn't know, it would make for some tough selling on the part of Blizzard.<br />
<br />
In the case of MoP and WoD, I can see your point to an extent.</div></div><hr />

Saying &quot;maybe&quot; to something like the transmog thing, sure, makes sense. Saying &quot;maybe&quot; to future dungeon content? Fucking stupid. They don't have to promise specific dungeons, just a promise that they will add it. Especially when they pined about how they fucked that up in MoP.

Kinda like how we pass through Krasarang Wilds while leveling, but level 90 story content didn't open up there until 5.1.<br />
<br />
Except Blizzard has said its not timetravel, just an alternate dimension or something.. you know, a bad excuse to not say its timetravel.<br />
<br />
I wonder when Blizzard will deliver on the promise of faster content. They have been saying it for years now. <br />
I'm not that psyched over an Orc themed expansion after MoP/SoO, but its heavily pointed at The Legion being involved and i hope so. If blizz can deliver content faster this time and this expansion leading up to another Legion based expansion, then i'll be happy. <br />
<br />
I'm having a hard time believing that garrisons will have that huge of an impact. Anyone on the beta that have spent a lot of time on these can comment? With only a few months to launch i doubt there will be any huge changes to garrisons.<br />
<br />
<br />
There aren't any class quests planned for Warlords launch right now, but if one fits later in the expansion it could be added.<br />
<br />
When someone asks about class quest later on in the expansion the answer will probably be something like: &quot;class quests takes a lot of time and would take away from develop Y and X content and is something we would like to include at expansion launch, maybe in the next expansion&quot;.<br />
<br />
But hey, maybe im wrong!</div></div><hr />

But I buy that he'll be a part of the final encounter, and argue that it's great. <br />

The end boss of Warlords of Draenor is literally the lord of the Warlords of Draenor. Why would it be anyone else?<br />
<br />
And whining that you don't want it to be Grom cause you don't want to fight an Orc is the same is whining that the end boss of WotLK was the Lich King cause you don't want to fight a human.

<br />
From my perspective a legendary is no longer a legendary when players view it as mandatory rather than a bonus. Because of such issues along with trying to get more to jump on the grind the task to obtain a legendary gets gutted as time goes on. A cosmetic legendary would hold value over expansions showing ones participation in an expansion. It shifts from something players find mandatory to something they want to do without rush and perhaps a key difference between a hardcore oriented playstyle and a casual one.</div></div><hr />

Very simplistic approach. If one is involved in the game as part of a community, and enjoys some aspects of it while bothered by others, s/he cannot just skip those aspects entirely. We have a degree of freedom of course in choosing how and what we play, but a legendary item or an endboss are essential, maybe even garrisons, I don't know yet. People ultimately leave if they don't like the direction the game is headed, but this break up is not easy for many.<br />

Faction specific characters as bosses for both factions will not work ever.</div></div><hr />

This has been known for a long time now. Anyone surprised or angry about Grommash being the last boss probably got their far-fetched information from an internet troll a long time ago.

<br />
Also 4 - 5 months seems short to me for a raid tier. Am I alone in thinking every 6 months would be nice?<br />
<br />
This i would love the each raid tier to last around 6 month, but tbh when blizzard tells it will go faster, i don't believe them so i am not worried and 4 months is better than 14 tbh ;).<br />
<br />
Couldn't care less about who the last boss is or what the name on him/her is, as long as the fight itself is epic it doesn't matter. Untill now WoD raid content seems to be around the top of the pack among Ulduar and ICC. For me it all comes down to how the mythic is tuned, whether or not is going to be in the very top tiers of raid content.<br />
<br />
Sure a dragon is more awesome than a orc, but i think most would agree that Garrosh is a better boss fight, than any dragon have ever been sadly.</div></div><hr />

No it isn't. This game is a hobby. This game is where you spend your free time. This game is where you spend 15 dollars a month. This game is what 7 million others also play.<br />
<br />
Nobody gets a game tailor made to their own personal likings. Look at it, decide if it is worth your money and play it or don't play it. Yes...complain, critizise, demand, suggest, discuss..it is all fair and good and appreciated.

You want to cry about Orcs twice?

It is time travel as such, but it won't affect our current timeline on Azeroth. So it is and isnt I guess. <br />

Anyway people, stop the hate. If you don't like it, its not your game. Move on to &quot;YAY WILDSTAR WOW KILLER 800 VIEWS ON TWITCH&quot;. I will still play it, ill pay my £8.99. If you don't want to play...don't play. This game will never be catered to EVERYONE and will be designed around &quot;an average&quot; idea of what people want.<br />
<br />
Look at flying for example. Looks like it is coming back. I for one (omg I pay my sub I need to have my demands met and im entitled to X Y Z) had no issue with flying being removed. If it comes back will I use it? Sure. If it stays removed will I adapt? Sure.<br />

Just live with the changes...or dont play.</div></div><hr />

I haven't been as excited for an expansion since Wrath was announced, and it turned out to be my favorite. I'm not a Blizzard fanboy by any means, but good lord, they're not all scumbags just trying to get that 15$ (or more) out of you. For goodness' sake, they're a part of Activision now, OBVIOUSLY Activision is going to force them to add more microtransactions and money grabs, but the employees at Blizzard that have been there for years still care about the Warcraft universe.

<br />
I wonder if half the whining in this thread about things like this is that people have not read and understood what was said / written..<br />
<br />
Farahlon was always a content patch, it was announced as such and was never going to be in at launch, Tanaan wasn't, so no, this makes it sound like it *may* be a content patch in the future, rather than 100% a content patch in the future.<br />

Last boss semi disappointing. Can't really judge it until we see the fight though.<br />

<br />
To be honest, I also expected an Orc like Guldan or a Demon from the burning legion, Darn, I would have prefered Jaina going mad and making his own version of Dalaran to siege it.<br />
<br />
Nothing against Garrosh as the final boss of an exp, it was a fun boss, and in my opinion, a better fight than Deathwing madness, but Gromm, it is too similar to his son, both think almost the same, and probably use the same abilities<br />
<br />
Then again, if they wanted an orc as final boss again, they could choose Guldan, that would be fine and acceptable.<br />
<br />

Legendaries aren't legendary anymore. Look back at TBC, you just killed Illidan, you're next in line for the Glaives, and they drop. Your heart nearly skips a beat when you see that orange text in the loot table.<br />
<br />
Now look at MoP. You finish the last quest. You talk to wrathion and the cloak is in your inventory. Yay I guess? Legendaries have gone the way of epics, they're not legendary, they're not a rarity, they're handed out to everyone. Give us something on the same scale as Thunderfury, or the Warglaives or Shadowmourne! Give us something we can easily recognize on a high end player and think &quot;Holy shit, I want that&quot; and make us WORK FOR IT! Don't make it a gods damned quest reward!<br />

<br />
This 100%. People should remember the first Draenor (Outland) expansion.<br />
<br />
Illidan was clearly the final boss. Grom is clearly meant to be the final boss here as well. But I expect the Burning Legion to come soon after. They will never forgive such a betrayal... and the slaying of one of their Supreme Commanders, Mannoroth.<br />
<br />
I expect Archimonde to have a heavy hand in this expansion working in Mannoroth's place. Some items and quests in beta refer to Archimonde a few times at least.</div></div><hr />

There is more spin here than a stripper-pole. First, Blizzard internally wanted to muse about whether players could 'learn to love a world without flight.' Now they are shifting the responsibility away from themselves (the people who make the freaking game), and pinning it on the shoulders of the community!? That's some genuine BS ladies and gentlemen.<br />
<br />
The portion of the community that loves to troll the official forums, Twitter and Facebook postings (etc) will absolutely scream that they are fine without flight, and become Blizzard's scapegoat in the situation.

But the past weeks and months since Blizzcon have been a very sobering experience.<br />
<br />
Where to begin...<br />
Garrissons - Unlike what was announced at Blizzcon we wont be able to choose where they will be placed but we get a cookie cutter place where it has to be put. We even get a cookie cutter place where the different building types have to go. So essentially, if two people choose the same type buildings their Garrissons will look exactly the same. No individuality will be allowed.<br />
Then the Devs came and said we will be able to move the Garrisson to a different place at a later date. NOW it is being said we MAY be able to move it at a later date and that additional features are &quot;something that COULD be done in future patches&quot;. Only second to &quot;SOON&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot; and &quot;COULD&quot; are Blizzard's way of saying &quot;forget it&quot;.<br />
<br />
At Blizzcon it was said the final boss wouldnt be another Orc yet again. And what a surprise, we get another Orc. This time we don't kick Garrosh's ass, but his father's. Nothing against kicking Orc ass but two expansions back to back being Orc heavy ... is Chris and the rest of his team running out of ideas? I can't wait to enter a big ominous room and see Hellscream staring down at my raid with gorehowl at the ready...<br />
oh wait, I already did that.<br />
I'm so disappointed I don't even have words.<br />
<br />
A ring with a visual effect as the X-Pacs legendary? Wel, I guess Frodo and his friends will resub now. And the &quot;very likely&quot; in the statement ... well, another phrase we can put in with &quot;soon&quot; and &quot;maybe&quot;.<br />
<br />
Further there will be zones that aren't in the game yet, things that were used as sell points during Blizzcon which aren't brought into the game and so on. It seems Blizz took the usual route of making a damn good sales call at Blizzcon and then once a ton of presales have been made they take things away, mark them off as &quot;soon&quot;, &quot;maybe&quot; and &quot;possibly later&quot; and give us the virtual middle finger.<br />
<br />
Just like the big chance to revamp the game with Cataclysm was fucked up badly, the second chance to do so in WoD is also being fucked up. Just like the guy sitting in the White House, Blizz went from &quot;YES WE CAN&quot; to &quot;We'll do our best to attempt&quot; to finally &quot;Oh well, we tried&quot;.<br />
<br />
So what will be in store for the next X-Pac? We go back in time 36 years and fight father and son together? That would be an awesome idea, three Orc X-Pacs back to back. Please do it so that I can finally become SO disappointed and disgusted with the game that I won't be fooled into buing another X-Pac.<br />

So I was hyped about the new expansion. Very much so! <br />
But the past weeks and months since Blizzcon have been a very sobering experience.<br />
<br />
Where to begin...<br />
Garrissons - Unlike what was announced at Blizzcon we wont be able to choose where they will be placed but we get a cookie cutter place where it has to be put. We even get a cookie cutter place where the different building types have to go. So essentially, if two people choose the same type buildings their Garrissons will look exactly the same. No individuality will be allowed.<br />
Then the Devs came and said we will be able to move the Garrisson to a different place at a later date. NOW it is being said we MAY be able to move it at a later date and that additional features are &quot;something that COULD be done in future patches&quot;. Only second to &quot;SOON&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot; and &quot;COULD&quot; are Blizzard's way of saying &quot;forget it&quot;.<br />

Been there, dne that allready.<br />
Sure that WoD would most likely have some Orc in the last Raid but the main boss could've been someone from the Legion or the like. Is Blizz really THAT hard up on ideas? It IS disappointing.<br />

Watched the entire Blizzcon footage, with my virtual ticket and vacation days... can't believe the joke was on us all along.<br />

They said this right before Pandaria though as well.<br />
<br />
I just can't buy it anymore.<br />
<br />
Actually they have parroted the same garbage since BC was released. They talked about trimming expansion releases down to an unrealistic year back then. I don't see the problem with two year expansion cycles. The problem comes when the expansion cycle is two years but content ends after 10 months, so you have to toil away for more then a year on nothing new, the expansion still takes just as long as it always has, and doesn't include any expanded content anyway. the new 2 month patch cycle was only supposed to mean shorter patch cycles with odd patches being quality of life changes and even ones being content. What we end up with was one less content patch both expansions they started using them in. Just end this patch cycle and go back to 3 major patches. Quicker content means nothing when you get less of it.<br />
<br />
Burning Crusade launched with the most content any expansion ever has for WoW and they didn't skimp on Vanilla content to create it. Their excuses are getting tired. They have yet to deliver a new and fun PvP experience since BC. Just the same played out ideas and there is still no King of the Hill. Even the MoP ones are tiny and basically stand in this squar and PvP or follow this circle and PvP. No new battleground either, I guess that's fine because it would have just been another garbage rehash like Battle for Gilneas or Twin Peaks. Sure the team expanded by 80 members but after they fired all those people a while back are they even back up to par. Sure we do not know how many people were on the developer team, but we do know their track record compared to before the team split for Starcraft/Diablo and the layoffs. It's pretty safe to say the team is still much smaller then it was in Vanilla/BC. Either that or they are just fine with releasing less content every expansion.</div></div><hr />

If players enjoy it then it could last longer. If players overwhelming want flight back by Patch 6.1, then they will most likely get it.<br />

I hope you will be calculating this metric based on something more accurate and reliable than forum spam from a vocal minority, or less susceptible to stuffing like the chopper contest turned out to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enter room, Grom there with Gorehowl (looks familiar.....). we fight, injure him. Cue iron star galore and orc enemies flowing in. <br />
<br />
At a certain point (let's say he gets to 0% again like Garrosh) he yells out &quot;Gul'dan, I was wrong! I need the blood&quot;! and out pops Gul'dan and drenches Grom in Mannaroth Special Reserve. Cue Demon powered Grom with felfire infused Gorehowl. Fight commences and then we win.<br />
<br />
Sounds familiar....but then again Blizz is known for repetition....</div></div><hr />

I've played WoW since before Open Beta. And although I've unsubbed in the lulls between both Cata and Pandaria expansions... this would make me never touch the game again.<br />
<br />
I really hope you're wrong... but I'm nervous that you're right.</div></div><hr />

Before these were names and for some people didn't even know who the hell was Grom Hellscream or even why there's GREEN orcs. <br />
Like Metzen said these people who made the very foundations of Warcraft were at points just names and not really characters... or just fodder so I can't really complain at really experiencing what makes this game, this game really since without lore and a storyline... Why the hell are you playing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Legendaries aren't legendary anymore. Look back at TBC, you just killed Illidan, you're next in line for the Glaives, and they drop. Your heart nearly skips a beat when you see that orange text in the loot table.<br />
<br />
Now look at MoP. You finish the last quest. You talk to wrathion and the cloak is in your inventory. Yay I guess? Legendaries have gone the way of epics, they're not legendary, they're not a rarity, they're handed out to everyone. Give us something on the same scale as Thunderfury, or the Warglaives or Shadowmourne! Give us something we can easily recognize on a high end player and think &quot;Holy shit, I want that&quot; and make us WORK FOR IT! Don't make it a gods damned quest reward!<br />
Quest reward huh....like thunderfury or shadowmourne....interesting....... It takes more skill to complete out the quests for a legendary then it did to just get a lucky drop. Look at all the people that still haven't gotten one or that are freaking out over the cloak quest being removed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do any of you even understand the incredible Nerdgasms of facing THE Hellscream? one of the most legendary characters of the entire Warcraft universe?<br />
<br />
I agree Garrosh was a pitiful excuse of an end boss, but Grommash F...ing Hellscream is F...ing awesome.<br />
and I can't wait to &quot;mount his head on my wall&quot; along with Illidan and Arthas (the Real &quot;Villians&quot; of Azeroth)</div></div><hr />
