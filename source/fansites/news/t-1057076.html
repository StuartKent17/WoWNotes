The sword is fine learn to adapt and overcome seriously. It's really not hard to get past the Tentacle's hell I've done it without much issue.<br />

Yeah I think I'm gonna go with you on this one. Most likely it will be a $25 mount and $10 pet at the Blizzard Store. Look during WotLK, they added the Pandarian Pet at the Blizzard Store and Cataclysm came right after.</div></div><hr />

This week we got in to grind legendaries and Rhyolith reached phase 2 and became friendly but killed us. On the next wipe because of lag and all, although the whole raid was outside the encounter was still in progress. <br />
<br />
Right now we are waiting for Ragnaros to come out of his bath thub so we can engage him, because guess what! He is not there! Heroic ragna has left the building, normal ragna is here..... Even the GM can't help us, we need to wait 30 minutes... LFR was a major fail because now they are not permitted to manually &quot;touch&quot; the encounters....</div></div><hr />

Do you know what the PTR is for? Testing things. Do you know why you test things? Because they might contain bugs. Well done, you've found one. Instead of passive-aggressively spouting &quot;hurr GG Billzard&quot;, you could report it.

The sword is fine learn to adapt and overcome seriously. It's really not hard to get past the Tentacle's hell I've done it without much issue.<br />

On another note Sad to not see the Ret 2pc T13 fix in this yet but it's early so holding out some hope on it.<br />

I think that guy meant the sheer damage output of those tentacles on, say, a Ret. They are usually the top damage dealing ability, which is a bit much for a weapon proc to be doing I think.</div></div><hr />

actually, the bombardement talent has been working like the new tooltip says since cata hit. it's only a rewording of the (wrong) tooltip!<br />
there was a short time period after 4.3 when the proc was only for the next shot, but it caused issues with flight times and such, so they reverted it quite fast.</div></div><hr />

Common feature of most other MMOs that I play.... the one other that I know of off the top of my head is GuildWars. At the 4 hour mark it begins to urge players to go take a break.<br />

It's mostly a liability avoidance feature. If Blizzard can say that they put a message in the game telling people to get up and move around and take a break, people can't sue them for their kids playing WoW until they pass out/die.</div></div><hr />

Really? I thought it was more like: M1-M2-(bombardment)-M3-(bombardment)-SS-SS-M4-M5-(bombardment)<br />
In other words, M3 would only proc bombardment because firing it after M2 marked 2 consecutive multishot casts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. Also, some more information on &quot;optimization&quot; would be interesting to see. <br />
<br />
Example: Game keeps usage statistics for areas that I have not been to recently and then removes those from my hard drive. I then roll a new toon and visit those areas, now the download servers must feed all that information to me yet again and probably will effect gameplay initially. <br />
<br />
Storage is cheap. If optimization is about moving data around and making them make more sense and not having everything spread out amongst 97 different mpq's, then I'm all on board.</div></div><hr />

I know right now it only affects the next Multi-shot, but it would proc off of that one, which would lead to another proc on the next one. So on and so forth. This doesn't really change much. Also, the LnL change, I wasn't aware people used it for AS anyways, but maybe I don't play surv enough(its just my OS).<br />
<br />
The Fel Drake looks sick, can't wait to see how the pet looks. As for where to get it, my guess is TCG reward.<br />
<br />
The change to LnL prevents hunters from using one of the charges on arcane shot. Which often happens when dumping your focus and the proc pops up.</div></div><hr />

In other words, M3 would only proc bombardment because firing it after M2 marked 2 consecutive multishot casts.<br />
<br />
yeah, well, that's how they intended bombardement to work at first, i guess. but it caused huge problems due to latency, flight time and 1-second-gcds, and no on really noticed how it really worked until they implemented it in 4.3. so this was what happened when it was launched:<br />
<br />
ms1 (40 focus, the arrows are still on their way so they don't proc a new bomb) - ms2 (costs 40 focus because the buff still isn't there because the arrows of ms1 only landed an instant ago and the server didn't reward the buff yet) - bomb of ms1 procs - sad hunter - ms3 (20 focus)<br />
so basically, nearly every other ms was without bombardement, which was of course a huge nerf.<br />
the good thing about the &quot;new&quot; old mechanic is, spamming MS on few adds might already be viable if they live long enough to compensate for the initial 40 focus costs. you don't need to worry about not critting every MS (the fewer targets there are, the lower the chance of a crit which means a bomb refresh) as the buff will hold 5 secs nontheless. :)</div></div><hr />

My major question is why they used a black drake if it's for the Burning Legion. I figured nether drakes were more on hand. <br />

Actually, to be honest, it makes absolutely no sense to me, lorewise at least, why they'd use a black drake.</div></div><hr />

There has been no indication what so ever that we have anything to do with burning legion in or after 4.3 and from what we have heard about Mists it doesn't seem likely that the burning legion would have anything to do with that either. It's also weird to have pets and mounts in the live game files for an expansion that is not even in beta testing stages. Which leaves TCG items, though it's weird that there are just these 2 and not more items. Also, anyone know of any upcoming TCG decks or something have to do with Burning Legion?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even though you can target the tentacles and kill them with relative ease? I know you said &quot;items&quot; though im guessing this is one of them.<br />
The sword has this ability cause it lacks any other non base stat i.e. mastery/crit just make a macro target it and kill it. Not sure how much health they have if its a lot than yeah that should be nerfed but im not sure the damage is the problem.</div></div><hr />

If your gonna compare mounts between the two games can i bring up the memory leak windows vista 64bit users are experiencing with Star Wars? Not to mention the fact sw:tor's normal raid bosses are easier then the heroic 5 man bosses. <br />
Every game has its issues sure but to say wow sucks when star wars sucks in some ways as well is pretty hypocritical.<br />

And no... their bosses are not easier than 5 heroic bosses... worse if you add the fact that you don't have macros/addon support avaiable yet. So in the end they would not be smart if they actually put up crazy dbmlike-addon-must-have-fights for players to manage without said addons.<br />
<br />
Yet, not easier than WoW lolroics... (guess not a single game out there can beat wow's heroic bosses nowadays).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speaking of, would there be an increase in performance? I'm betting there is, but how much would be the question. It's been said that WoW is mostly a CPU based game, so having a better CPU means a better game. Of course, RAM, Graphics card and HD speed also are part of the equation, but CPU makes a bigger difference. Also, the server and the connection speed affect this game. <br />
<br />
This 64-bit client will allow WoW to take advantage of the architecture and instructions of a 64-bit processor (most people not using a completely obsolete paperweight should have a 64-bit processor by now. All multicore CPUs are 64-bit). This should give a boost to parallel processing and multitasking, but the question remains, just how much can this game benefit from this? As I am not a Computer Science major (yet) or a Computer Engineer or Electronic Engineer, I can only pose questions. Hopefully someone else can answer this, at least in generic terms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be because the Data folder has been reconfigured.<br />
<br />
Pretty much all the patch files for 4.0.0 PTR -&gt; 4.3 PTR have been merged into existing files. There's a new world2.MPQ file there as well. Because of this it's having to redownload files.<br />
<br />
Basically it's like this :<br />
<br />
When the launcher opens it compares the files it has in the Data folder against the list from wow.mfil<br />
<br />
If it finds files in there it doesn't have it goes &quot;I has new files to download&quot; and starts downloading those files.<br />
<br />
Now if your question is why don't they just make a script program that copies the new files from the existing ones ? It may have a lot to do with the fact the PTR's only just opened. There could be a PTR launcher update that does that coming. We don't know atm.<br />

?<br />
<br />
You shouldn't even have that file in the Data folder anymore :|<br />
<br />
Try this :<br />
<br />
First go to your PTR folder then the Data folder then the enGB folder<br />
<br />
Drag the OldWorld-enGB.MPQ file out of that folder altogether. Also take out any OldWorld MPQ files you find in there. Put them all in a folder in My Documents or something , making sure you're moving them and not copying them. You want to take any OldWorld files out of the Data folder completely.<br />
<br />
Then go in the PTR folder and delete the launcher.wtf out of the wtf folder as well as wow.mfil &amp; wow.tfil out of the PTR folder.<br />
<br />
Then open the launcher from the PTR folder<br />

First off all, how do we get the launcher to do this? My launcher (on OSX Lion) came up same as usual and didn't do anything. <br />
<br />
Did it automatically for me.<br />
<br />
Didn't show that picture in the launcher. Rather it opened it in Safari. It does need to download updated tools - there should be a blue bar going across the launcher when that happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i'm putting money on a legion themed mini raid dungeon to hold us over until MoP is released. TCG, and blizzard store mounts tend to be crazy stuff with new models in order to make us &quot;want&quot; to buy them. there are like what 13 mounts in game using the generic drake model? my guess is that Wrathion will ally himself with the legion since he has no &quot;path to power&quot; now with the aspect's power being depleted.</div></div><hr />

Then what are the Felsteed ( http://www.wowpedia.org/Felsteed ) and the Dreadsteed ( http://www.wowpedia.org/Dreadsteed )? They have been there since vanilla, Felsteed since release and Dreadsteed added in a later patch.<br />

Vista...<br />
<br />
Windows Vista...<br />
<br />
Right...<br />
<br />
People don't use vista still, hmm ok if you think so....does wow have a memory leak in vista 64 bit? :P<br />
A PC game created for one PC, windows, not mac yet having massive memory leaks upon exiting the game is kinda of strange<br />
Another thing bothering me is the fact that it creates unnecessary files outside of its directory and related files. This is similar to Pando being downloaded for F2P mmos. Programming like this while not malicious,is close to malicious...makes you wonder what else they put on your machine...<br />
<br />
Also read again i wasn't comparing wow dungeons to star wars dungeons or addons. I was saying star wars 5 man heroics are harder than star wars normal raids. Just read the forums and you can figure that out.<br />
Above all i was saying people say there game is the best but in reality it has just as much faults as any other game it all depends on your tastes. You like it good for you, I happen to like out leveling zones i get bored of (Not a fan of the quest grind in any game) an not being forced to complete a zone (Even a starting one) to move on.<br />
For that reason i passed on swtor does that make me a bad gamer? Nah i just have different taste's like everyone else. I knew i wouldn't make it far so im not wasting my money.<br />
<br />
I would like to think that's being a smart consumer and not jumping in just cause it's Star Wars.<br />
<br />
<br />
Umm.. you realize no other class has access to their own class mount other than pally right? If locks get another class mount, all classes should get one also as compensation.<br />
<br />
Not true Warlocks and DK's have there own summon able class mounts, who's to say this isn't a warlock mount that they summon. (I don't think so but you never know, i think its TGC related)</div></div><hr />

I'm betting there is, but how much would be the question. It's been said that WoW is mostly a CPU based game, so having a better CPU means a better game. Of course, RAM, Graphics card and HD speed also are part of the equation, but CPU makes a bigger difference. Also, the server and the connection speed affect this game. <br />
<br />
This 64-bit client will allow WoW to take advantage of the architecture and instructions of a 64-bit processor (most people not using a completely obsolete paperweight should have a 64-bit processor by now. All multicore CPUs are 64-bit). This should give a boost to parallel processing and multitasking, but the question remains, just how much can this game benefit from this? As I am not a Computer Science major (yet) or a Computer Engineer or Electronic Engineer, I can only pose questions. Hopefully someone else can answer this, at least in generic terms.<br />
<br />
Atm wow doesnt use more then 2 cores but with this 64 bit patch it will be able to use the most out of your cpu.<br />
Aswell as wow doesnt use more then 2 Gb of ram atm and with this patch it will be able to use evrything u have.<br />
<br />
So for ppl who run on a I7 and 8 gb + ram will defo see a major improvement.</div></div><hr />

Personally what I think he meant to say was ... you realize that compared to warlocks, no other class has access to their own class mount other than pally right? If locks get another class mount, all classes should get one also as compensation. <br />
<br />
He knows that warlocks get their ground mounts as he clearly states it in his second sentence. Sure he overlooked death knights but that's a different story. He could have just worded it differently. Personally I'm of mind that only what, three (four if you count druids) have class mounts leaving the rest of the bunch in the cold, that it would be lame if they got their own random drake as well. My money would be on TCG or maybe pre-MOP event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically, the tons of patch data that has been gathered up since 4.0 will be added into the base MPQs, saving some space and speed. I imagine this happening every few major patches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are getting BoP Strider's this time in the lunar festival we know with the currancy, and so is valentines day, makes sence that they do something with Omen and the drops seem to tie in with the lore.<br />
<br />
<br />
The demigod Omen was a being of great strength and knowledge. Blessed by Elune, Omen wandered primordial Kalimdor, guiding hunters and gatherers and offering luck and advice to all he met. When the Burning Legion launched their attack, Omen allied with Azeroth's defenders. Omen fought bravely, but after many battles, his wounds from demonic forces plunged him into a deep, dreaming sleep...where fel-inspired nightmares slowly consumed him. When he finally awoke, centuries later, he had fallen to madness - WoWWiki<br />

Basically, the tons of patch data that has been gathered up since 4.0 will be added into the base MPQs, saving some space and speed. I imagine this happening every few major patches.<br />
<br />
To explain a little more:<br />
<br />
The MPQ is Blizzard's data storage file - everything from art to spells. Before Cataclysm, each patch would over-write the original MPQ data, leaving just &quot;base&quot; files.<br />
<br />
Since Cataclysm patches have become separate MPQ files, each containing a set of changes since the previous patch. So each time the game needs to load data, it not only has to check the base file, but read through all the patches in sequence, to check for changes. The Cataclysm-style allowed data to be streamed, and small fixes to be distributed easily, but does have the disadvantage that after a while (especially on PTRs), there are tens of patches to be checked, which presumably slows down load times a little.<br />
<br />
What the optimization appears to do is combine previous patch MPQs into base MPQs.<br />
<br />
Now, I presume that streaming still works like before: The optimization is simply bringing the client's files in line with the latest base file - the base file that one would get streamed if one needed it. That would explain why the optimization cannot be skipped - because otherwise there would not be a source of streamed data, if your client needed it. It also suggests that optimization will not be a common process - likely only around the time of major patches. And this reduction of patch files into base files was something that the game client has done before during major patches - it just didn't announce it as a special process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try this :<br />
<br />
First go to your PTR folder then the Data folder then the enGB folder<br />
<br />
Drag the OldWorld-enGB.MPQ file out of that folder altogether. Also take out any OldWorld MPQ files you find in there. Put them all in a folder in My Documents or something , making sure you're moving them and not copying them. You want to take any OldWorld files out of the Data folder completely.<br />
<br />
Then go in the PTR folder and delete the launcher.wtf out of the wtf folder as well as wow.mfil &amp; wow.tfil out of the PTR folder.<br />
<br />
Then open the launcher from the PTR folder.<br />
<br />
Problem is, most of us get this error when we run the INSTALLER, aka before we even have a PTR installation. I think this error is caused by trying to find this oldworld mpq file in our retail install, and then well, not finding it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I've found some more posts on the subject.<br />
<br />
Have sent a few emails up the MVP chain to see about getting this fixed :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There wouldn't be many benefits that you would immediately notice. The ability for the game to utilize more than 4 GB of memory is the main point of interest, and even then that's something that wouldn't affect players for several more years, if it ever were to at all. 64-bit is a great way of making the game more &quot;future proof&quot;, so to speak. The amount of average memory in a computer since WoW's release in 2004 has probably more than quadrupled. If that trend continues along with WoW's continued growth and evolution, there's no doubt that we could be exhausting the 32-bit address space limit altogether years down the road.<br />
<br />
I wrote up a post over at the WoW forums several months ago that I would like to think does a fairly decent job explaining what benefits a 64-bit client would and would not bring with it. If you're interested in reading it, here's the thread:<br />

WoW already scales with Crossfire/SLI.<br />

That would certainly be something of a rebuke to certain complaints that keep cropping up. (I hope, however, that they save actually killing Kil'jaeden for Argus.)<br />
<br />
It might, however, just be a 'lock mount. Or a TCG reward. Or any number of other things.</div></div><hr />

I would say this is right but I do NOT have a PTR version of wow installed and I'm getting this exact error as well even just trying to install it fresh.<br />
<br />
Edit.<br />
<br />
Found the answer on the Blizzard forums. It is a PTR installer problem. as shown in this thread here<br />
<br />

Nothing we can do until they fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard didn't change up any terminology. The PTR is still running from a standard 32-bit executable.<br />
