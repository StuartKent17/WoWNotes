Patch 6.2 - Cats on Laps<br />
Players recently discovered (https://twitter.com/WarcraftPets/status/623192561935454208) that if you target some of the cat battle pets and do /sit, they will sit on your lap.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/july/thumb/lapCat.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/july/lapCat.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler has recently provided (http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler) longer answers to some questions than tweets would allow. <br />
There's a clear difference in balancing/patching practices between Riot and Blizz. Riot has faster 2-3 week iteration cycles and Blizzard has 4-6 month content patches. What do you feel are the reasons for this difference (dev philosophy/game dev practices/game structure/manpower/management)?<br />
Blizzard was very concern about player backlash from too many changes on WoW. We were always worried about the returning player who couldn't recognize their shaman (or whatever) because the rotation was completely different. It's a tough edge to walk -- keeping current players engaged with enough changes, without alienating returning players.<br />
<br />
League players, even if they have mains, don't have characters in the same sense. The individual champions are a lot simpler, even though it is probably still very intimidating to return to League after a long absence and having no idea what all the new champs do. I'd say overall League players expect more frequent balance updates.<br />
<br />
I am explicitly not commenting on which approach is right or wrong. They are very different games with different philosophies. I also am not in tune enough with current Blizzard games to know what their balance philosophy is for Hearthstone or HotS. <br />
<br />
How much of an impact has modern day theorycrafting (WoTLK-era sophistication with SimC dev/RAWR) had on the design/development process in WoW? Do you think this has in general been a positive force for players and/or developers?<br />
I'll answer from the POV of League, though it is relevant to almost any game where players strive to &quot;solve&quot; it, even D&amp;D.<br />
<br />
This might surprise you, but I don't think theorycrafting is healthy overall. It removes a lot of the fun and experimentation for players when the right answer is so readily available from Google search. (Often it isn't even the right answer, but players think it is which amounts to the same thing.<br />
<br />
Now I get that it is fun for players to theorycraft and author guides. It's fun for me too. I also get that players want to be armed with thr best knowledge to be the most effective. Being right is satisfying. I also get that those discussion help build community ties and give players a way to interact with the game when they can't actually play it. I also don't think there is a realistic way to chill it out. But if I could reverse time to a world where the information wasn't so readily available, I would. I'm not going to try to fight it though. It's here and will stay. <br />
<br />
You've mentioned several times in the past that your job is to remove barriers, etc, for your teams. I always wondered what you mean by that. Can you provide some general examples?<br />
These are not literal examples. Please don't read too much into them.<br />
<br />
Example One: A team feels like they can't make progress on a design idea because they don't have the buy in of the creative team working on lore. I get buy in from the lore guys or more likely tell them we're going to go ahead with our design and they can give feedback when it's done before we ship.<br />
<br />
Example Two: A team of designers feel blocked because they need a particle artists to add effects to a weapon or spell. I find them a resource they can borrow so that they can do the design they want instead of something designed around the absence of art resources.<br />
<br />
Example Three: A team feels like they have to run every decision by the design lead on the project. I get buy in that we can try out one of the team members in a junior leadership role so that they can be the accountable party on their project and not the busier top-level lead.<br />
<br />
Example Four: A team basically all agrees with the direction of a desgin but lacks the confidence to ship it. I talk through the design with them, get them to realize that they are in fact competent people who should trust their intuition and experirence.<br />
<br />
I usually use removing barriers as a contrast to giving orders. I have found that little of leadership is actually about commanding people. Maybe it's different on an actual battlefield. IDK. For me I have found that teams usually want to do good work, but something is gumming up the pipes so to speak. <br />
<br />
What's less likely to get a full sequel - League or WoW? Both seem like they'd benefit from a totally new game engine but can't just bin all their current playerbase.<br />
You can update or overhaul a game engine without asking players to switch games. Traditonally, sequels were really important to the business model because boxes made all the revenue. Neither WoW nor LoL is that dependent on them. On the other hand, the risk of ending up with a much smaller population in 2.0, or even worse, having a divided population over two different but very similar products is high. I think it only makes sense if you want to change the gameplay so dramatically that you need the 2.0 to really sell that. There are also advantages from a PR perspective - sequels get more mainstream coverage than updates. <br />

Pretty sure fire is not for single target bosses, and that is working as intended. Granted with enough gear and procs a few fire parses will always be high even on ST bosses, that is the exception and not the rule.</div></div><hr />

Gorona believed herself to be half human until up until she discovered she was half draenai. So it's technically correct.<br />

Paladins are in the top 10 according to Simcraft and generally in the top 5-10 in Warcraft Logs. So it's not like we're exactly under powered at this particular moment.

I think it's nice they're doing small things like this. They used to add small stuff like this all the time, until they started getting into that corporate mindset of &quot;don't spend time on anything we can't hype.&quot; It's not an either-or scenario, as much as Blizzard would like to convince us otherwise in an attempt to avoid the effort (&quot;It'll cost a raid tier&quot; nonsense).<br />
<br />
<br />
Garona half orc half human? wtf?<br />
<br />
I love how a couple of years ago most fans were livid that the comics retconned Garona's heritage, but now people are getting their panties in a bunch at the possibility that the movie might undo that change. Not that it matters, because IT'S A DIFFERENT CONTINUITY, but still, I find it both humorous and frustrating that people have this hyper-critical perspective on the film's lore, even when they make changes they should actually like.</div></div><hr />

I can understand the recoloring of gear. But I agree that the gear in the last expansions was looking worse than the stuff they did in vanilla and BC. They just force the theme of the expansion onto sets that should better revolve around the theme of the class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
5)Why Garona was said to be half-human? Why she looks similar to human? Why she doesnt look like draenei?<br />
Answer: In the original Garona was said to be a human until Draenei appears in the story too. In the Last Guardian, Movie based on which, she was said to be half-human. Looks like in the movie it will be revealed later that she is not half-human, like in the original. Also, her description in the same novel, fits her look in the poster.<br />
Quote: <br />
In the description nothing points at some draenei's unique facial traits. She was a lean, with less greeny, more smooth skin, smaller fangs and tusked face. Just like on the poster.<br />
So yeah, this is another misconception.</div></div><hr />

it amounts to a 25% buff to 50% of their damage ... it should bring SV right up to BM. So yes, they will both still be @2% behind MM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the actress is playing Garona in the First War. If Garona thought she was half-human in the first war, then the actress also believing the character is half-human would only add to the believability of the acting. You have NO idea how the director had these actors research their roles. Since there is so much fan-story and theory bullshit online, it's very possible these actors were prepped for their roles by being handed material by the director to study. If he didn't want the actress knowing the real truth about Garona because it might make the acting more genuine, then he's a damn good director in my eyes.</div></div><hr />
