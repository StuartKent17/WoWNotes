In the Apothecary Frye encounter, area of effect damage has been reduced against pets.<br />
Dying during the Blood-Queen Lana'thel encounter will no longer prevent you from gaining Once Bitten, Twice Shy achievement. <br />
<br />
Icecrown Citadel Hall of Fame<br />
A couple of people yelled at me because I didn't recap first kills for Icecrown Citadel (or ToC in 3.2), apparently heroic modes won't be too easy to complete and it might take more than a week to see a Lich King kill ... time to bring back the Hall of Fame! It's a lot easier to have something accurate now that the armory includes the exact time of completion of achievements, but let's face it, these days you just have to go to WoWProgress (http://www.wowprogress.com/) for that kind of data. <br />

Fucking finally. Killing the bitch every week and literally dying EVERY KILL on the last 10 seconds of the fight, thus not getting the achievement, WAS FUCKING ANNOYING.[/list]</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's even more pathetic that people don't simply don't realize that the difference between those guilds you see here and the average guild is VAST. On most servers guilds are still working on normal mode ICC.<br />
<br />
Is it really sooo hard to comprehend that Blizzard isn't tuning hard modes towards the skill- and coordination levels of the raiding elite? Yes, Paragon might 'crush' the hard modes, but then again they practise and prepare together to such an extreme and put so much effort to it, it IS to be expected it would go like this.</div></div><hr />

You DO know how many guilds have actually killed the heroic bosses?<br />
Yeah easy, every PuG can do it, right?<br />

Also you can design an encounter to be beatable but still hard. Here people are doing them in less than a week. HARD MODES are ment to be HARD in theory. I mean come on. There are hard things in life to do, they are still beatable but they are HARD. They take more than A DAY.</div></div><hr />

As for people who say its all too easy let me ask you this. When is the last time, in any game you played, you spend 9 hours or more trying to beat a boss, or level, or puzzle or anything else and failed to succeed?<br />

The only thing I can recall personally is the second last level of the original lemmings. I spent ages on that and never beat it and that is going back 19 years. It is incredibly hard to design anything that is both beatable and incredibly hard to beat. <br />

Seriously, not to sound like an ass, but believe it or not, people who tell you to do it first before passing judgement really are right. Difficulty is subjective and therefore in general, different between each person, to fling sarcastic insults is just being a hypocrite unless you have actually done it. It's like saying mountain climbing is easy while sitting on your couch, just because other people do it.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that these guilds are downing them this fast is probably representitive of at most 1% of all players, they are the outliers, the extremes. These people have probably been playing WoW like a job for 5 years, I'd be more surprised if they didn't pretty much barrel through anything. If blizzard designed a raid to cockblock such a small subset of the populaton for weeks, and completely deny the average player/raider then any educated business man would probably give them the &quot;are you fucking stupid?&quot; look.<br />
<br />
Not to mention time isn't always indicative of difficulty, i've one-shot bosses in games that i find freaking BRUTAL. Games like DMC, Ninja Gaiden, and Bayonetta (most recently) are games i consider quite challenging, yet i beat bayonetta (to use the most recent) on normal mode in one day, and then hard mode in one day (a different day, i didn't do both in ONE day), and i don't think it was easy, the gracious and glorious enemies (normal enemies, not bosses) are freaking insane, whereas my friend can not beat the final boss of FFX, which i found to be moderate at best.</div></div><hr />

^This. I would like to know. By the time they beat it, it doesn't seem like it contains much new mechanics to learn.<br />
<br />
Still I doubt that the game got MUCH easier. Only more people are able to make it easy via addons like dbm and there are tons auf guides and class min-maxing available for everyone. Of course things got easier but not everthing in large amounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention that based on some of these kill times it looks like these guilds have been raiding more or less straight through since patch release. I mean, any normal guild that was stuck on Saurfang for 5 hours would have had little choice but to call it and try again another day. Probably the next evening after normal working hours at the earliest. It's possible they slept at some point in the 5 hours, but since they hadn't been going all that long when they beat the Gunship, that seems odd. Based on the spacing of the kill times it looks like Vodka hit it from a little before 2100 GMT on the 9th to a little after 1100 GMT on the 10th, so around 13 hours straight. My guess is that they then switched to their alt raid to do all of the non-attempt bosses again so they can burn their alts attempts to learn the last two fights.</div></div><hr />

To rephrase this slightly: &quot;If a boss / encounter does not take the best of the best longer than a week to defeat then it is not difficult enough.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not sure whether I agree with this or not, but the fact that hardcore guilds can defeat bosses with no limited tries so quickly still makes me worry a bit. How long before they stop playing because everything is on farm so fast...? The limited tries excuse by blizzard for making bosses last longer has been old since Algalon and right now it's the only option they seem to have besides putting RNG-kills into it.<br />
<br />
I'm not good enough at WoW to be in any of these kills, but I'm a fan of the race. Right now, the race is over too fast.</div></div><hr />

Obviously there isn't enough data for converting a top guilds total time spent on a kill to the average guild but if it actually took those top guilds that long, I am pretty sure the average curve wouldn't down the bosses.<br />
<br />
Yogg0 for example, Top guilds at first said it was impossible, then the strategy was formulated, then the kill followed much later, anyone feel free to give the total time it took to get that kill but it was a LONG time. And don't say oh, they weren't trying to get it because it was just a mount, don't kid yourself they were all trying to get it. I used Yogg0 because that was one fight that wasn't pushed over in a week, which seems to be what all the &quot;pros&quot; out there are dying for.<br />
<br />
Now with that said look how many people have completed yogg0 to this day. Top guilds, and upper level guilds, which is what? not even 1% of the population.

If it wasnt for the fact that Blizz staggared the encounters, i think LK hardmode would of been done in 2 weeks. Now THAT is a problem.<br />
<br />
Dont forget, this is ment to be the epic ending to the expantion, and its almost all been beated.<br />
<br />
What happened to all the cockblocks of the past? Chromaggus, Twin Emps, 4 horsemen (40 man), Reliquary of Souls, Brutallus, M'uru, Kil'jaeden. These are the encounters i remember most and they were HARD. Some we spent weeks clearing to, then spending 6 nights a week wiping.<br />

I agree, the races in vanilla were like 3 months long. The only reason it's taken 2 months to get this far is because Blizzard opened the instance slowly. These guilds are probably going to run into the same thing Death and Taxes did where thier main raiders are going to get bored with the raid being on farm so quickly and then the guild fell apart.</div></div><hr />

I agree on this , they should not have given tier gear for&quot;heroic badges&quot; , it just waters down the effort those who did the instances had to do to get good gear, i loved how in BC they geave similar offset items BUT which didnt have set bonusses fromvendors , which were not too high , but at least let casuals see the iportance that raiding still = much better gear.Now they do heroics to get sets with bonusses which people worked hard to compelete</div></div><hr />

On top of this, everyone is obsessed with gearscore or your wow heroes score. Most people with high gearscores since ICC came out are pathetic on my realm. I'm around 10-15th highest wow-heroes score for alliance on my mage for my server, but I've looked at every one of the mages in the top 25 and based on stats I'm around 4th or 5th best geared becuase the fools above me dont know how to itemize properly.</div></div><hr />

I've never done a hard mode. Hell, I don't even play WoW any more, I just check back to see what's going on. But I think, too, that the hard modes are (did?) go(ing) too fast. I might never see them. I don't care - I want to be able to KNOW, somewhere deep inside myself, that the pretentious (and, in my mind, lifeless) people who go ahead and spend 90% of their time doing world firsts have to put just a BIT of effort into doing what they do. It brings me satisfaction to know that someone, somewhere have to put in work to stay at the top, rather than just gear up and then faceroll it on release day. And I believe that's how most of the MMO-Champ population are put together, though they are never going to admit it.</div></div><hr />

According to world of logs only 20% percent of raids that attempt rotface can down him and only 10% of those can down the prof on normal mode. I don't think its actually easy if you see the numbers.

Disagree. Black Temple/Hyjal was pretty easy and it still took Nihilum roughly a week and a half to completely down it. My guild used to raid more then, but it took us roughly 3 months to do it. I'm sure the limited attempts in ICC would cockblock us, but I don't think the ones with unlimited attempts would.<br />
<br />
I really hate people bringing up Yogg0 repeatedly. Yes, only a few guilds have beaten it to this day but very, very few guilds have the time and energy to beat old content. The encounter is extremely difficult, yes, but Blizzard also released TOC relatively fast. That just killed it.</div></div><hr />

You would log on and every day for months you would see posts like Yogg, Mimiron or Algalon hardmode world first. The time between posts would be spred over weeks.<br />
<br />
The ICC hardmodes were all done in ONE NIGHT.<br />
<br />
These uber elite guilds didnt get good since ICC came out. SK Gaming/nihilum, Vokda and Paragon have always been good. It's all down to ICC being far too easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its more of Blizzard not needing to nerf these encounters after the elite guilds can't get them down. It also is probably that the gear requirements are not as high. Ulduar 25 was designed around having 213 gear, there was a very limited amount of 226 gear. ICC 25 is designed around having 245 gear, however the elite guilds had full 258 when they entered.<br />
<br />
The limited shared attempts does mean that we might not see any guilds get more than 1 wing down this week. Next week we should see those guilds get another wing down.</div></div><hr />

Grats to Paragon! Hoping that when they kill the LK hard mode the rogue doesn't spam his character panel nine million times....<br />
<br />
I remember it took the first guild that killed the 4 horsemen in Naxxramas 40 man around 8 weeks ;O<br />
<br />
Anyways even when Cataclysm comes Blizzard will always been attempting to change raiding. It's impossible to please every single person in this game, so they need to go with what the majority wants. <br />
<br />
<br />
I would LIKE to say hard modes should take around 2 weeks to be completed by the top guilds HOWEVER being someone who raids 10 mans and is on the Professor I assume I'd have no say in that ;) At any rate I think blizzard has done a wonderful job from when they first started, they are constantly learning and each expansion, each raid instance they improve. You can say a majority of people dislike raids or whatever HOWEVER it would be best to provide some statistics (that aren't made up on the spot) ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Video from Deathwhisper was linked.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it just looks like more health/damage output rather than new mechanics.<br />
<br />
I think the game is hard for the average player, yes. I'll probably never see LK HM and I accept that.<br />
<br />
But look at these top guilds. They're plowing through it, and it's sort of sickening. I understand, they're the best of the best, but I'm sure they'd like to see a bit more than same mechanics, just needing more DPS/healing per fight seems like it'd be REALLY boring.</div></div><hr />

We mostly attributed the ease of ICC normal in expectation of ICC Heroic being truly hard. Yeah these are the elite guilds getting all the kills but still, the same guilds took a long while to kill the hard modes in Ulduar (no, I am not talking just about Yogg+0 all the hard modes in Ulduar took a bit more time than this). Heck Sarth+3D and Malygos speed run took more time than this as did Anub. If this is the level of difficulty then all the guilds that managed to get ironbound drakes in 2.3 should be able to kill Arthas on Heroic once the buff gets implemented. Heck I am pretty sure I'll get an Invincible before Cata. I am not saying that ICC Heroic will be easy but it sure as hell is not as hard as it could be.</div></div><hr />

Once another top guild sees the kill, they then replicate that exact strategy, and are CAUGHT UP with them. Why would they want to relinquish the lead? They're ahead, aka more attempts on Putricide and LK than the next guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a scale between easy and hard, you know. I just think it is being heavily misused here. ICC is not easy, but is it really hard? You are in a casual raiding guild as are many people. I am sure this means that out of 25 people you have about 10 good-great players who form the core, another 10 decent players who can pull their weight and at least a handful of mediocre or even bad players who fill the slots. Now tell me, if all the players in your guild were as good as the core would you call ICC hard?<br />
<br />
The point is, the content can also be of average difficulty. It doesn't make it easy and casuals will have a very hard time doing heroic ICC, but eventually even the casual raiders will kill LK on normal, and every dedicated raiding guild will get the heroic kill once the +dps/health buffs are applied.</div></div><hr />

They will never down any of the heroic bosses / maybe not even lich king ect.. on normal. <br />
<br />
However alot of the fun for me when I wasn't in a better guild was the top guilds race.<br />
These races used to last longer however now they usually last like 3-5 days.<br />
I think its exciting when a boss is so hard that the worlds best are having trouble downing bosses just because its fun to watch everyone race to the end.<br />
<br />
Either way it doesn't matter to me, ill most likely see them eventually.</div></div><hr />

There is no lore here,unless you consider a 15min kill as lore. These were suppose to be hardmode. It should have tuned in such a way that ppl would require some min gear level/ skill level to clear it.ppl did it in one day means at most 25 loot was received. So one loot each player.

You want to return to vanilla days, where you have to gather world buffs just to have a chance? When it could take months to finish the instance?<br />

You want to return to vanilla days, where you have to gather world buffs just to have a chance? When it could take months to finish the instance?1. They are also defeating the content so fast because they raid with a large roster AND alt-raids AND 10-mans etc. That try-system is an ABOMINATION of epic proportions for EVERYONE.<br />
<br />
Its no longer &quot;who is able to defeat that boss?&quot;. Its moire like &quot;how many alt-/10-man-raids do you have?&quot;...<br />
<br />
2. And yes, I would prefer wiping 100-200 times on a hard boss over the course of a couple of weeks over being done with the content after 6 hours. It doesn´t matter that my raid would take 3-4 weeks for a boss that way. At least we could raid 2-3 times a week and not 6 hours and be done (unless you want to do the same shit 2-4 times a week for 6 fucking months like with Ulduar, ICC and TotC).<br />

I just think it is being heavily misused here. ICC is not easy, but is it really hard? You are in a casual raiding guild as are many people. I am sure this means that out of 25 people you have about 10 good-great players who form the core, another 10 decent players who can pull their weight and at least a handful of mediocre or even bad players who fill the slots. Now tell me, if all the players in your guild were as good as the core would you call ICC hard?<br />
<br />
The point is, the content can also be of average difficulty. It doesn't make it easy and casuals will have a very hard time doing heroic ICC, but eventually even the casual raiders will kill LK on normal, and every dedicated raiding guild will get the heroic kill once the +dps/health buffs are applied.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with everything you are saying and you also depicted my guild to the T which in turn you also have depicted 90% of guilds to the T. The problem lies in this matter: Blizzard has 11mil+ clientele they have to please and 90% of these people are in the &quot;casual&quot; bracket these people need to be pleased in a priority over the &quot;hardcore&quot; people. Thus you get content that seems to be easy but, it's tough for the mass population. All I'm trying to say is that the game is good as it is and complaining about difficulty is not going to change it. just concentrate on your own/guilds goals and accomplish those. Get your guild up on forums and WFs. When you have these then you have all the right in the world to voice the difficulty of this. It's funny how these guilds that downed everything don't even waste their time posting how easy the fight was on a forum. :P</div></div><hr />

Would you prefer encounters that were not beatable, or that relied on a really slim string of RNG luck? <br />
<br />
<br />
To you and to all those replying similarly: Ulduar hard modes took over a month to beat and were certainly not based on RNG luck. There are two failings here:<br />
<br />
1. Unlocking ICC slowly meant that by the time people could do hard modes at all, they'd already done a month an a half worth of gearing-up.<br />
<br />
2. There appears to be no progression to the hard modes. That is, you can kill the later bosses using gear you got in normal. As contrast, look at the original 40-man Naxx (which was essentially all hard-mode). There, it was tuned so that you needed gear that you could pretty much only get in Naxx to beat some of the encounters.<br />
<br />
I do see this as a failure in Blizzard's tuning of ICC because hard modes don't exist for the rank-and-file. They're supposed to be the alternative to the &quot;everyone gets to see the content&quot; mode that most raiders are still working through. That they went down like an inappropriate metaphor (excepting LK) means that they were not tuned for the best players who are supposed to be their target audience.<br />

It's an ego thing; everyone wants to feel like they did all that they could. <br />
<br />
Here is an objective measurement for how these fights might be considered easy: the multi-try bosses are being downed by people who have a very small amount of heroic-level gear between all of them. From what I can gather, hard-mode bosses are supposed to require an enormous amount of both skill and gear. That is the whole reason for the slow nerf built in to Icecrown Citadel. The idea behind Blizzard's design is that raids are supposed to be designed to be extremely difficult, but then nerfed if they are too difficult. <br />
<br />
Bottom line: the game is supposed to have content to challenge both the casuals and the hardcores.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2010-02-11, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I'm a fan of the race for hard mode world firsts and even though I'm not capable of competing with guilds like Ensidia and Paragon the fact that the race is always over so quickly is disappointing. I'm pretty sure 99% of hard modes from this expansion (with a few exceptions like Yogg+0) that don't have a gimmick limiting the time guilds get on them (limited tries, limited time, gates...) are dead within the week of release. The normal modes shouldn't be aimed at these kinds of guilds but the hardest of the hard modes definitely should. At the very least the first, un-nerfed version should. So far half the hardest hard modes in ICC (Blood Queen and Sindragosa) are dead within 48 hours of being released; those fights should've lasted weeks each.<br />
<br />
To combat this, blizzard has only 3 options I can think of:<br />
- put time / attempt constraints on the encounters (because that isn't an obvious attempt to make content last longer when it would be killed within the first week without them)<br />
- overtune encounters so that specific gear (resistance or hard mode drops) is required in order to kill them<br />
- make the fights massively challenging to the most hardcore of guilds (something they seem to be afraid to do)<br />
<br />

I'd expect that most elite guilds cleared up to the end of wing bosses with their mains on heroics and then made an attempt on each boss to gauge whether they had a shot at them without using alts. Otherwise they cleared on non-heroic with alts till those bosses and tried them one by one until they felt comfortable trying them again on the main raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am going to have to disagree with your overall assessment here. These raids are challenging for like, 95% (if not 99%) of all players in the game. The cream-of-the-crop players like paragon (and other guilds who race for world first). I wouldn't even call these guilds hardcore, they are like...beyond hardcore. Other guilds raid many times a week and eventually get all bosses down will find this challenging. (I call these kinds of guilds the real &quot;hardcores&quot;.)<br />
<br />
SO the incredibly-overwhelming majority of Blizzard's customers are going to find heroic modes fun and challenging. Guilds like paragon are going to crush them. <br />
<br />
I would find really-really-really stupid if Blizzard tuned any content(including hard modes) so the top &lt;1% of players will take weeks to down them.(And everyone else never will)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And here is a tip for all those that wow has become to easy. Try this game Imperishable night (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS2Ot38irqo) from the touhou serie (this is part 8). And you will come back to wow really fast because it's to hard for you. (almost forgot to mention but yes that movie in the actual speed it's not speed up in any way)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing is, I'm sure its because of Blizzards artificial gating. All these top guilds are now trying these hard modes in 264 gear instead of 258 gear.<br />
<br />
If you think back to Ulduar, most people were attempting hardmodes in mostly 213 gear, not 226 gear. Once you whole raid was in 226 the hardmodes wernt particulary difficult.</div></div><hr />

Gratz to Paragon. I'm guessing in the end (a few months after HM LK is down) the only world first kill that will actually matter - and be remebered - is HM LK, so who knows, maybe Ensidia is scoping out the attempt bosses on an alt run or something. Either way I hope it is a good race and I'm excited to see who gets world first for HM LK!</div></div><hr />

A LOT longer than this. thank you and goodbye.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can't really compare the two on even ground. Comparing Firefighter to Sindragosa, for example, it's actually taken guilds longer to kill Sindragosa than it did to kill Firefighter due to the gating system. You can't compare the two basing it on the time from when hard modes were unlocked because on the day Ulduar opened the guilds were running in 213/226(what few pieces there were between KT and Malygos and Sartharion) gear and it took them a couple weeks to gear up to tackle hard modes. While the guilds who are killing ICC hard modes now already have been gearing up for two months and are already in all 264 the day the hard modes were released.<br />
<br />
For a fair comparison you have to also take into account the gearing up time. 3.1 was released on April 14th and the World First Firefighter was done on May 1st. That's two weeks. 3.3 was released December 8th and these people have been farming the ilevel 264 gear required to do the hard modes for two months already. Saying it only took them two days to clear everything but Lich King(and Putricide) while it took two weeks to clear Firefighter is completely ignoring the fact that they were geared for the encounters the day it was released because of the gating system.</div></div><hr />

1. does lich king in icc10 normal drop any marks of sanctification?<br />
2. how many marks drop off lich king in icc25 normal?<br />
3. how many marks drop off end bosses in icc10 heroic?<br />

This guy should be quoted into the MMO-C Hall of Fame.<br />

You can't compare the two, it's impossible.<br />

Besides, the fact that nobody has killed Putricide-25H yet? The majority of ICC HM's are EASY FOR TOP GUILDS, but there are a few cockblocks, it appears.</div></div><hr />

When i started wow back in TBC i was inspecting guys with full t5 and i was hoping, that someday i could get sets like that. But there is no point if you get those for &quot;free&quot;. I think the best thing in the game is when your your guild learns to play well together, improve themselves and finally hear nerd screams on vent when you down boss after few weeks of wiping. When i finally was idling with my full t6 it felt good, because of the effort i had put into raiding and to get em. Now when the blue items are more rare than epics, you get tiers if you just leech some heroic 5mans without doing nothing. <br />
<br />
And the argument &quot;what majority wants&quot; This game became popular before faceroll content. I understand that blizzard want more players to see whole content but this tactic wont work. People are lazy and they just skip naxxramas and ulduar and farm 5mans and toc and doesn't see whole content anyway. Back in TBC it was also easier to find guild or new members to your guild just checking gear and progress they had made. On my realm there were guilds progressing t4,t5 and t6 content in same time and you could easily see what kind of ppl you were dealing with. <br />
<br />
Also if blizzard decided to make harder encounters it would give them time to make better ones with less bugs in future. (And make own instances for 10 and 25 mans &gt;.&lt;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And stop posting the wowprogress.com stats about the kills or saying &quot;most people haven´t even killed Arthas normal yet&quot;. The limited tries save bosses from being killed and nothing else. I stopped raiding a couple of weeks ago, but my guild needed 23 tries for PP and 14 for BQL. Because of the limited tries thats four weeks instead of one-two raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild may not be 9/12 but I can confirm that the non-attempt bosses are not difficult for the guilds that got Lich King down the first week.<br />
<br />
A bigger &quot;roadblock&quot; for some of these guilds is server lag and members who aren't available all day to get these bosses down.<br />

World firsts deserve laud and praise but they are more meaningful when the boss is actually challenging.</div></div><hr />

That is one of the dumbest things I've read on here in weeks, and that is quite an accomplishment. Were they supposed to require 277 gear to do the bosses that drop 277 gear?</div></div><hr />

If you tune a &quot;hardmode&quot; so that people outgear it with gear that EVERYONE has when it is released, then you obviously failed.

Oh tier 3, my bad. I said 8 tanks needed t8, same content, blah blah.<br />

The fact still stands, however. It's why it took what, 7 weeks to kill? But once tanks had the gear required, it went down EASILY the next week. That is fact.</div></div><hr />

You people that keep bashing blizzard for making something easy are full of it. Number one , You need to stop comparing yourself and blizzard to a few top ranked raid addict guilds, Their whole lives revolve around this game just look at the time between kills any guild that raids for 12_+ hours SHOULD down a heroic boss , this is all they know how to do in life , so if you dont see blizzard making it hard enough your wrong , regular guilds with limited 3 hour raid times each week wont donw these bosses for a while your looking at this the wrong way, heroic is not just a gear check there are several other thiings involved in a heroic besides gear.</div></div><hr />

yeh, most people are right, LK and all hardmodes died waaaayyyy to fast (1 night? SRSLY?). Imo anyway, but its still going to take the mediocre guilds many many weeks to make the same progression.<br />
Just bad luck to people who do get all hardmodes within the next two weeks, guess your going to get very bored of wow till cata comes out.<br />
