<br />
The quest Made in Kul Tiras (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/54706-made-in-kul-tiras) starts at the Stormwind Embassy. Jaina wants you to meet her in the Harbormaster's Office of Boralus to discuss finding a shipwright, Dorian Atwater, to build Anduin a ship.<br />
Cyrus believes Dorian retired to Stormsong Valley and has you meet him in Brennadam to find out the location from the talkative locals. You discover they are somewhere in the Deadwash and Cyrus leaves to let Jaina know what you have discovered.<br />
When you discover the house, you question the man outside only to find out that Dorian is his wife. She agrees to come out of retirement to fulfill Jaina's request. You help her saddle up Hurricane, her horse, and meet her at Port Fogtide.<br />
There, she has you kill 12 drowned forces and place 3 fog wards to set the location for her slip, and then requests to meet you at Algerson Lumber Yard in Tiragarde Sound to get lumber for the construction.<br />
You collect the lumber and bring it up the hill only to find that it is haunted. Dorian has you seek out Chelsea Wright and Thornspeaker Birchgrove in Drustvar. <br />
Birchgrove has you kill enemies to charge a vessel with Drust magic. You then take it to Ulfar and help him cleanse it. <br />
Meanwhile, Chelsea loses her storage key to a wicker beast and you have to chase it, get the key back once it stops in a cave, and eventually collect its suspiciously dog-friendly belongings. You find out the beast is actually her deceased dog, and use the key to get what you need. If you did both quests, an air elemental appears and sends you back to Port Fogtide to meet Dorian.<br />
The ship is complete, but now it needs a crew. Jaina arrives to inspect it, and says she has the perfect captain in mind, her brother Tandred. Tandred wants you to recruit Brother Pike, Lt. Tarenfold, and the outriggers as his crew. Once you collect them, you meet back at Port Fogtide and Tandred convinces Dorian to be the last crew member.<br />
All that is left is to name it. You are given the choice, and the options are:<br />
<br />
Dawnstrider<br />
Tiffin's Melody<br />
Lionheart<br />
Anduin's Wrath<br />
<br />
Your choice strictly affects what the NPCs call the ship, nothing else.<br />
Brother Pike then blesses the ship and you present it to Anduin, who is moved by the gift.<br />
Finishing this quest unlocks the Kul Tian allied race, the Allied Races: Kul Tiran (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13163-allied-races-kul-tiran), and Kul Tiran Charger (https://www.wowdb.com/items/164762-kul-tiran-charger).<br />

Zandalari Troll Allied Race Unlock Quest<br />
<br />
The quest A Royal Occasion (https://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/53831-a-royal-occasion) starts in the Orgrimmar Embassy. Rokhan wants you to pay a visit to the Zandalari emissary in the Great Seal. The emissary tells you that Princess Talanji is about to undergo the ritual of kings and queens at Zacalo and has requested you at her side.<br />
Once there, you join Talanji's procession to the temple as crowds gather. Some support her rise to queen while others call her cursed and Bwonsamdi's puppet.<br />
Before the ritual can begin, Zolani rushes in saying a riot has broken out. You are tasked with quelling the masses and stopping the instigator, Enforcer Malzon, before returning to Talanji.<br />
Talanji understands and respects the people's anger. She wants you to rescue bystanders and subdue more angered devoted.<br />
You then meet Talanji's new council, which consists of Wardruid Loti, Lashk the Tortollan, Jo'nok, General Rakera, and Hexlord Raal. Again, the ritual is delayed by a priestess of Shadra, Samara, who taunts Talanji and attacks with spiders. You must survive the attack and kill Samara to head up to start the ritual with the Loa.<br />
The first Loa is Krag'wa, who wants Talanji to prove that she would give her life to defend her people. You are turned into a firefly and must avoid frogs while Talanji protects you.<br />
Next is Gonk, who tells Talanji to consider who is part of her pack. Is it more than the Zandalari? Does it include the Vulpera, Tortollan, and Horde? She receives his blessing soon after.<br />
Pa'ku is next, who gives Talanji her blessing after you dodge tornados up a set of stairs.<br />
Finally, you reach Bwonsamdi, who has taken the highest position of the Loa. Talanji wants him to test her and be done with it, and he says that he will free her from her father's bargain if she brings him the head of Sylvanas, to which she declines. Bwonsamdi is disappointed, but accepts her answer.<br />
Talanji is now officially made queen and gives a stirring speech to the crowd below. Vol'jin's spirit can be seen watching for a few moments before bowing and fading away.<br />
Talanji summons Sylvanas to her throne to discuss the Zandalari joining the Horde, and says that they will stand as equals. Sylvanas questions this statement, but welcomes them anyway.<br />
Completing this quest unlocks the Zandalari Troll allied race, the Allied Races: Zandalari Troll (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13161-allied-races-zandalari-troll) achievement, and Zandalari Direhorn (https://www.wowdb.com/items/157870-zandalari-direhorn).<br />

Jaina voices its name when Anduin asks. I thought it would just be used for a single text bubble line, so I was actually surprised.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, Anduin's Wrath makes no sense. The other two were okay but generic to me.<br />

Tiffin's Melody was the one I selected as well.</div></div><hr />

That and it's kinda big for a boat. Although i'd have expected one of the largest KT ships, not a smaller one.<br />
<br />
Still went with Lionheart. Dawnstrider and Tiffin's Melody seem unfitting for a warship, and Anduin's Wrath sounds contradictory. Varian's Wrath may have worked.</div></div><hr />

It's a cool quest but damn, after rep grinding for months, I wanted to pretty much just play them right away patch night, but eh, no big deal.<br />
<br />
Oh and I named mine Tiffin's Melody too and agree, Anduin's Wrath was lame and Lionheart sounds cheesy too. I even made a poll in the RP/lore forum out of curiosity to see what the player base chose, didn't know it'd be discussed here, lol<br />

Good old Hearthstone, the game I played during WoD's life cycle when I was unsubbed because it was new, fun and free. Then Legion came out, Hearthstone got old and haven't played it since. Mostly because when they failed to add a DK class, I was kind of pissed.</div></div><hr />

Just pretend, it stays for Anduin Lothar, Supreme Commander of the Alliance in the 2nd war, killed during the Battle at the Blackrock. He was also named &quot;The Lion of Azeroth&quot; and is the namesake for Anduin Wrynn.</div></div><hr />

Contrary to popular opinion, I have long maintained an Alliance alt for the sole purpose of seeing their story.<br />

This! <br />
<br />
I haven't created an Allied Race in probably a year. So I forgot that there's an unlock quest line. I went to create a Kul Tiran, and found out that I couldn't. It was grayed out, the tool tip stated the requirements, and I knew I met the requirements. I still couldn't create one. I even used one of those online checkers that use Blizzard's API's to check, and it said I met the requirements. I check the forums and others are having the same issue. It wasn't until a few hours later that I noticed a quest in the Stormwind Embassy did I remember that I didn't actually meet the requirements.<br />
<br />
This problem is quite obvious. So I can only deduce that Blizzard is intentionally leaving the final quest line out of the &quot;requirements&quot; because it would just make a bad situation (the work needed to unlock a simple race), look even worse.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it was hostility. He was asking for something he KNEW would be refused. He wanted her to refuse above all else. Whether that is because he's just funny like that or because he'll use that as leverage at some later point is another question. He's not any more hostile to the Horde than to anyone else, really. Bwonsamdi cares about Bwonsamdi first and above all, and his plans do not seem to include world domination at present. Who knows what a loa could really want in the first place. Even the whole worship and veneration shtick seems a little too overt.</div></div><hr />

Hate to ruin your little conspiracy theory about deliberate Blizzard deception but the fact that there is a questline is literally stated in the first paragraph of the patch notes:<br />
<br />
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22926354/tides-of-vengeance-content-update-notes<br />
<br />
It is also mentioned specifically for each race in the announcement posts for the new races:<br />
<br />
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105047-new-allied-races-ahead-kul-tiran-humans-and-zandalari-trolls/<br />
