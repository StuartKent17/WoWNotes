Hmmm. If I read that correctly, the tailoring requirement to use the flying carpet mount is being removed. Does that mean they are removing requiring the professions to use certain mounts?<br />
<br />
That'd be sweet...or at least if they make it so that as long as you have the profession on your account, you can use the mounts...<br />

What do you mean? The wall of text crits me too hard so I can't go through it all...<br />

Edit: Managed to find it...interesting, I wonder if this means that they'll be removing the MoP bosses and rewards from the guild and add new ones at some point in WoD...hummm...</div></div><hr />

I really hope its not done. Those heads are too big, and some one correct me if I am wrong, but isn't there usually a size difference between the heads on two headed ogres? Maybe, they will get awkward headpieces that only serve to highlight their big heads! :D</div></div><hr />

He looks fine to me, if not just a bit on the short side. Also, I see some people calling him cartoonish and misshapen. Compared to what? Ogres that are already in-game? He's probably not finished, but I think that it's the shoulders or the big robe he's wearing which make him look a bit off in proportions to some people.<br />

Also, that Death Knight Mythic Tier looks badass so far! Can't wait to see it finished and animated!<br />

<br />
Boub's reference to Brawler achievement becoming &quot;Legacy achievements&quot; = Feat of Strength or is &quot;Legacy achievement&quot; something else?<br />
<br />
They are moving some Feat of Strengths into a new category, so achievements which are no longer possible (such as realm firsts, gladiator titles, classic PvP titles, old challenge modes etc) will become &quot;Legacy Achievements&quot;, and those which are just don't provide points, but still obtainable such as &quot;Camel Hoarder&quot;, Legendary items etc, will remain feats of strength.<br />
<br />
It's highly unlikely they'll remove Brawler title from those who earned it, and if so they'll likely give them a &quot;legacy title&quot; instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's incorrect. They added a Soul Shard requirement to baseline Soul Swap. It now costs 2 Soul Shards to Soulburn Soul Swap, and it costs 1 Soul Shard every time you Soul Swap your DoTs from one target to the next. I confirmed this on the Beta this morning.<br />
<br />
This could potentially be a very good change. You either make the process for applying DoTs trivial and give the DoTs themselves poor damage (MoP style), OR you make Warlocks put efforts into applying their DoTs and give the DoTs themselves good damage (Cata style). I've personally been hoping they bring back the DoT damage to health pool ratios of Cata compared to MoP.</div></div><hr />

Boub's reference to Brawler achievement becoming &quot;Legacy achievements&quot; = Feat of Strength or is &quot;Legacy achievement&quot; something else?<br />

Butthurt cause you won't be able to bring your unskilled behind into Brawler's guild at lvl100 and kill everything with 1 spell? How about you learn how to play the game at it's most basic level before whining for welfare rewards, since BG at the ilvls we have now, is cake.</div></div><hr />

Brawler's Guild is really, REALLY easy now. All the bosses were made with a 522 ilvl in mind, and even full LFR SoO gear is outgearing them, let alone Flex. Only bosses that take any effort whatosever are Hexos and Ahooru.<br />
<br />
I honestly think they should remove awards for all old content other than gear and MAYBE titles.</div></div><hr />

well techinically i would much more blame blizzard for not announcing those are season from very start - its catering to special snowflakes nobody else and its hurting game in longer run then benefiting it - which is provenby 200-500k people leaving game each quarter.<br />
<br />
removing things from game is never a good thing and i cant see how anyone see it as positive - i have got it but why woudl i want to stop anyone else from geting it is beyond me - only sad pathetic peopel take pleasure from such things. itso nly a stupid worthless chievo not affective your game play/style anyone yet some people seem to get off from having some more pixels then others.<br />
<br />
this is nothing but a desperate try so that some people buy some sub time before wod to get it done. proving that more and more people are leaving game eveyrday.</div></div><hr />
