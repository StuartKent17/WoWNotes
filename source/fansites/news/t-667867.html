Sure, they slow you down a little bit - but if anything, this will make the fight easier. Tanks won't have to try as hard to get their adds to frost; there's more frost to get behind when the boss is chasing you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya like other said this will make the fight a bit easier. In turn taking less time in many cases. Blizzard hasn't been one to make fights harder. Often when ever they say fix they mean they nerfed an instance/spell/ability in some way. Unless they are going to fix shadow priests.</div></div><hr />

Were you with the Stars or Paragon?<br />
<br />
<br />
Calm down... all he said was that the fight was already easy.... just because its not heroic mode doesn't mean that the encounter has to lack challenge. He was talking specifically about one fight and not raiding in general... <br />
<br />
That said, it seems like a somewhat pointless change, I don't think anyone doing normal anub really struggles with the ice disappearing, but then again I'm not really in a position to judge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Maybe for the 1% of guilds that have Alagon on farm mode, and spend 30+ hours raiding a week.<br />
<br />
Myself, we found normal ToC 10 not too terribly difficult. But heroic ToC we simply didn't have the gear to even do the first encounter.<br />
<br />
For 25 man, we just don't have the players to get past faction champs. Getting 20 raid members that can go at a certain time, while pugging 5 more and still being the most populated guild (with 80s) is not a good sign.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sardokar</div><div class="date">2009-09-10, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anub is pretty easy right now in normal 10 (my guild one shot him our first attempt last week, and again this week). I wonder if there were a lot of guilds having trouble with it because their ranged were not focusing enough on spreading ice. I don't really care if they make it easier since it was easy for my guild already, just an odd change to me as it didn't seem necessary from my perspective.</div></div><hr />

Where do you see in the blue post about it being a heroic change? It says Trial of the Crusader.. Trial of the Grand Crusader is heroic.<br />
<br />
Arrogant asshole.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calaba</div><div class="date">2009-09-10, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Anub thing seems more like a fix to me. It's easy enough on normal mode that if you can kill the twins (not that hard), you probably have the healing and DPS to kill Anub, regardless of whether the frosts can despawn. So it's not effecting the difficulty very much.<br />
<br />
For the hard mode, the frosts are pretty much limited anyway, you have JUST enough for 1 kite phase, with one frost left up at the end to kill the adds over. This makes it almost essential that he doesn't go into a second kite phase anyway, unless you can somehow survive it with only 1 frost patch. So it's not effecting the difficulty very much there either. <br />
<br />
The Icehowl change is a more of a nerf, since it means you can have 2 sets of tank cooldowns available in case of berserk. You can also let him stomp one or two others until the berserk has gone, and then taunt it back. It also means that you can afford to lose a tank, and battle res him. And so forth.</div></div><hr />

Both versions are called Trial of the Crusader. <br />
<br />
This is a change aimed at slightly altering the difficulty of the heroic version, no doubt, as it's a change that won't really affect normal mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but if they were making a change that was specific to the heroic version, they would have called it Grand Crusader, or possibly mentioned the word &quot;heroic&quot;.</div></div><hr />
