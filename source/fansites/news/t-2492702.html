Based on what? The content that will be available at the launch isn’t broke and is ready to be played - they’re not going to really care about some other mediocre mmo.<br />

Oh according to one of the datamined cinematics apparently we just placed the Artifacts in the Tomb during Legion and didn't bother having anyone stay behind and guard them afterwards. What's that? Legionfall you say? Nah never existed. What about how dangerous it would be to removed the artifacts apparently sealing the ToS? Dalaran didn't care enough to keep an eye on them it seems. What about the rest? Apparently she was kind enough to only steal one.</div></div><hr />

Which begs the question if they were actually still there or not! However, the Tidestone is the most valuable to Azshara and she’s cocky enough to think she’s more powerful than what the others can do anyway.</div></div><hr />

Those who pre-ordered FF's next expansion will get to play it as soon as the 28th, so it's really more like 3 days before.<br />

To be fair, Legionfall consisted of like, Velen, Illidan, Maiev, and Khadgar, and then Horde/Alliance troops.<br />
<br />
Out of all of them, only Khadgar is really left 'free' to defend it.<br />

I mean, that's actually a good point though in a way.<br />
<br />
What is the point of them being there or not still?<br />
There's no Fallen Avatar to seal anymore, Sargeras is locked away.<br />
<br />
The Tomb of Sargeras should be rather pointless right now.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but most of them with some exceptions are still tied to factions.<br />
<br />
like Liadrin for paladins.<br />
<br />
I think the closest to neutral off the top of my head were probably like, warlock, rogue, demon hunters, and maybe hunters?<br />
<br />
As far as the overall organization goes, since they were orders from before Legion even (Well, two at least were implied to be around for a longer time)</div></div><hr />

Cool. Don't comment then. Because it's not magically going to get better cuz it's not enough for you. Also, enjoy Classic for about 4 weeks until it's ancient design catches up to you, and reminds you how boring/unbalanced/and lack of features and systems treats you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ravenmoon</div><div class="date">2019-06-18, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the revisionist history, the night elves have no mention in any off Azshara and the eternal palace descriptions, it is as if she has nothing to do with them. And ofc we found out played little to no role on the alliance side (which put me off 8,2 massively, and if it wasnt for Thalyssra bearing the night elf torch I'd have boycotted it completely, now, lore wise, I'm simply underwhelmed)<br />
<br />
Consistency died in lore...and while we love new things, I certainly dont like that past lore means little or nothing and isnt a feature of the present..what is to draw people to explore past games, material and stuff if nothing of the new stuff is connected to its origin?<br />
I would have had written a book on Azshara that revealed the person she was before her rise to empress and how it changed everything.<br />
<br />
I expected so much more on the lore front for this character, this zone, and these encounters - I guess BFA continues to astonish in failing to match expectations, yet 8.2, while hailed as a great comeback, pleases in every department but lore - the one I hold most dear, for the race I hold most dear.<br />

Ah well, thank you, NEXT.</div></div><hr />

Azshara is very much a cocky son of bitch, and the tidestone fits the theme of her kingdom, the rest dont, so she feels no need to take em.<br />

<br />
Is there a reason why she uses the Tidestone to ease our pillaging near/inside her palace by draining the water?<br />

cause she wants to entertain herself with us, and recruit some of us, she then tries to collapse the waves ontop of us.<br />

the legionfall defended it, but unlikely some random nobodies could handle the naga all while wounded fighting demons.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
To be fair, Legionfall consisted of like, Velen, Illidan, Maiev, and Khadgar, and then Horde/Alliance troops.<br />
<br />
Out of all of them, only Khadgar is really left 'free' to defend it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, that's actually a good point though in a way.<br />
<br />
What is the point of them being there or not still?<br />
There's no Fallen Avatar to seal anymore, Sargeras is locked away.<br />
<br />
The Tomb of Sargeras should be rather pointless right now.<br />
<br />
khadgar came with us to fight kiljaden remember? he was there to teleport us out and such.</div></div><hr />

1) Yes, I'm not disputing that. But if she was so arrogant to intentionally not take useful artifacts, she wouldn't have bothered with the Tidestone. Naga have already been shown to be extremely successful at surprise attacks on boats after all (vashj'ir opening quest)<br />

Not really. There are enough people with Stockholm syndrome that will play WoW no matter how shit it gets. You can't let that 5+ year (or 10+ for some) time investment go to waste.<br />
FFXIV is the objectively better MMORPG at the moment and I've played WoW since start of TBC. <br />
I WISH I had data to back it up, but I don't - nobody has. I think we can all agree WoW is in the worst state it ever was (even considering WoD). Feel free to defend nu-Blizzard and their bad games. I don't care.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Again though, her being arrogant didn't change that she took one relic already acknowledging its power. Her arrogance has never stopped her from using powerful relics in general or other sources (Ex - Well of Eternity, Sargeras, N'Zoth, Sharas'dal, and now the Tidestone). She's always coveted powerful relics to be used.<br />
<br />
2) I am talking about in Azsuna itself when he refuses to join her after she asks him to. Again, like I said, betrayal she punishes, but it doesn't seem like she cares about intentionally killing people just for not following her orders to a T.<br />
<br />
3) We don't know enough to determine either way, but considering the raid culminates near N'zoth, I'd imagine he still holds a lot of sway.<br />
<br />
4) I don't remember a quest really either to be honest.<br />
<br />
And I'm fairly certain they mentioned it was after we left the Tomb in general, recently she took it.<br />
<br />
Not way back then.</div></div><hr />

Oh according to one of the datamined cinematics apparently we just placed the Artifacts in the Tomb during Legion and didn't bother having anyone stay behind and guard them afterwards. What's that? Legionfall you say? Nah never existed. What about how dangerous it would be to removed the artifacts apparently sealing the ToS? Dalaran didn't care enough to keep an eye on them it seems. What about the rest? Apparently she was kind enough to only steal one.<br />
<br />
we sorta left it unprotected and just.... sitting there in the tomb of sargeras...<br />

Not to be a negative nancy, it's just true.<br />
<br />
I know what you mean. I recently resubbed to try out the newer raids, zandalari and the xal'atath questline. But the gameplay isn't as fun as it used to be and the community gets worse and worse. :c</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plot or game convenience take your pick. She flaunts it as the centerpiece of her zone/kingdom and as the &quot;lock&quot; to her palace's entrance whilst throwing shade at the players by putting a guard on the Stone when we &quot;didn't&quot;. Funnily enough, said guard dies really easily and we claim it back no problem and quickly get access to her palace so it is extra dumb.<br />
<br />
<br />
Azshara is very much a cocky son of bitch, and the tidestone fits the theme of her kingdom, the rest dont, so she feels no need to take em.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
the legionfall defended it, but unlikely some random nobodies could handle the naga all while wounded fighting demons.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is funny considering Thalyssra tells us in Nazjatar a slight retcon about why the Nightborne bubbled up their city. The reason being that they were trying to keep the Pillars of Eternity away from Azshara who wanted them during the first demon invasion. Of course there is no clarification why there is only one by the time of Legion or when exactly the shattering of the Tidestone took place or how Aggramar's Aegis ended up back in the Halls of Valor but never the less it's funny that something Azshara wanted in the past is so easy to get now but she only takes one of them.<br />
<br />
Really? The Legionfall who had been defending against an onslaught of demons for weeks before we began our attack on the Tomb were push overs for a bunch of Naga? And Dalaran wouldn't have been keeping an eye on the Tomb whilst we were on Argus? lol what a pair of joke factions, amirite?<br />
<br />
<br />
Sooo... basically, the &quot;Burning Legion portal&quot; to Azeroth through the Tomb of Sargeras... is now reopened?<br />

FFXIV is the objectively better MMORPG at the moment and I've played WoW since start of TBC. <br />
I WISH I had data to back it up, but I don't - nobody has. I think we can all agree WoW is in the worst state it ever was (even considering WoD). Feel free to defend nu-Blizzard and their bad games. I don't care.<br />
<br />
Only thing we can truly say for certain is that the wow subscriber base is shrinking and the ff one is growing. Wows we can see by the financials, ffs we can see because they just announced that subscriber numbers are at the highest they've ever been pre expansion launch and that shadowbringers preorders are double stormblood</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be a spoiler for me to reveal why. But in the raid you will see. You can also learn from the Azshara voice lines from the patch which are available on youtube. <br />
<br />
But let's be honest, it's ultimately because players complained a lot about Vashj'ir in Cataclysm and so they've made the zone barely underwater, even though they are a race that live underwater. lol.</div></div><hr />

No Q&amp;A nonsense where community managers pick the questions. He tackles what he believes are hot issues at the moment within the community and game, and lays it out for us with thoughtful insight.<br />
<br />
Yeah, well, maybe I'm salty when it comes to Ion Hazzanexcuse, but his navel gazing and long winded &quot;insight&quot; are usually just kerfuffle to bamboozle you to not look at the dents in the game, just the new shiny part he's focusing on. <br />
<br />
I won't bother saying more, I've said enough on the subject in the past. The only thing that matters is if players think this is compelling enough to keep playing until the next big patch. Ion droning on endlessly about his &quot;philosophy&quot; and &quot;Grand Scheme™&quot; won't have much impact there, if it's a boring grind. <br />
<br />
And, to sprinkle more salt...I expected more for a raid focused on and featuring a massive lore character like Azshara. It's just underwhelming in how boring it is, in lore and gameplay. Battle for Dazaralor was WAY more interesting, even when not actually playing the game. Battle made me think - foolishly, perhaps - that the WoW team had their mojo back. Whelp. I guess, not so much.</div></div><hr />

Then you fail to understand the origin of the name. It's called MMO-Champion because World of WarCraft is the mmo champion. Even if hypothetically WoW had only one million subscribers, that would still be more than any other competition out there.<br />

If WoW had one million subs, no it wouldn't be, FFXIV is currently around 1 million, pre expansion. Other games easy have that many players, both ESO and GW2, but they don't require subs. <br />

Correction. Heavensward was between 1 and a half and 2 million. All we know that now subscriber number is at an all time high. Registered accounts are at 16 million. So subscriber number is anywere between 1.5 and 16 million.<br />
<br />
Also I have no idea how many people preordered Stormblood, but Shadowbringers got double that number.<br />

again you literally looked at one building in nazjatar and went &quot;THIS IS A COPY PASTE!&quot;<br />

Here is all of nazjatar, the circled area is the ruins location, and most of the buildings and assets there are brand spanking new, however there is the odd copy/pasted building<br />
WHICH MAKES FUCKING SENSE<br />

if you split stormwind in half, then cried that the north and south half of stormwind look the same, you would be called an idiot... and surprise!<br />

Players wouldn't be so adamant if the game was actually good, class design is at an all time low, systems are at an all time low, people don't like bfa and it shows in the revenue.<br />
<br />
We want wow to be good again, but the devs keep doubling down on stupid. Where's the class fixes? The ones promised pre launch???<br />

By the gods, this is some next level paid shilling.<br />
<br />
all BFA zones are dull as fuck, Even ESO and FF14 most dull zones still has more content and stunning visuals than BFA, even Northrend in wrath + modern wintergrasp still has something to do, and if i were to extend it, WoD zones.<br />
<br />
BfA zones are simply there's NOTHING NEW about it, Zandalar is a mix of the 5 most boring zones of WoW history, which is Uldum, Swamp of Sorrows with cata Duskwallow quests, and Discount STV with Un'Goro Skin. The Alliance Zones are even worse, all of it are generic besides drustvar, which is literally redone Duskwood.<br />
<br />
OH and a quick edit: AZSUNA WAS GENERIC ARATHI HIGHLANDS WITH A FEW SPOTS OF ASHENVALE AND SUMMER DRAGONBLIGHT!</div></div><hr />

Oh according to one of the datamined cinematics apparently we just placed the Artifacts in the Tomb during Legion and didn't bother having anyone stay behind and guard them afterwards. What's that? Legionfall you say? Nah never existed. What about how dangerous it would be to removed the artifacts apparently sealing the ToS? Dalaran didn't care enough to keep an eye on them it seems. What about the rest? Apparently she was kind enough to only steal one.<br />
<br />
Well also the armies/heroes that went into Tomb all got forcibly teleported out by Kil’jaeden. Canonically, between the time we left Azeroth and teleported back to Azsuna, it was all unguarded or the guards were defeated.</div></div><hr />

It’s not hard to understand and there’s logic involved - we left them there. We raided the place and moved onto Argus, which let’s be fair, was the bigger problem. It funnily enough makes sense, seeing as we always do move on and forget about places we’ve raided.</div></div><hr />

Way over your head. Sylvanas will, by the end of the expansion, been the focal point of the entire story, a story that's been polarizing and ill-received by the player base at best. Meanwhile, Azshara, a character big enough to be the main villain of her own expansion, was relegated to a mid-expansion patch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Major villain&quot; shouldn't be used as loosely. Kael'thas was a whole other beast. Technically, he shouldn't have been a villain at all, but that's a whole different argument. Azshara has been set up lore-wise to be as big as characters like Kil'jaeden, The Lich King, and Deathwing, power and character-wise. Not on the level of lesser villains like Gul'dan, Zul'jin, or Yogg-saron. Then again, it's not the first time Blizzard fucked up. Lei-shen should have been the final boss of Mists, not Garrosh hopped up on Old God heart juice but that's irrelevant here and now.</div></div><hr />

How do you think there cutting cost? They put a metric ton of work into all the azerite pieces with tons of different effects and then put even more time into the essences. It’s unlikely they have saved any money.</div></div><hr />

sylvanas isnt even fucking in this patch dude...<br />
also remember when illidsan was a mid expansion boss, as was kaelthas? we have always had major villians mid expansion or else we would still be fighting the lich king right now.<br />
<br />
Do you actually remember how it was? And remember Blizzard admitting that they've screwed things up? From not leaving Illidan as the TBC end boss (but not mid expansion btw, that position is for Kael'thas and Vashj) to wasting a legendary weapon (Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury) as a carrot to keep people interested in Sunwell Plateau.<br />
<br />
Black Temple was the last content originally scheduled for TBC. Sunwell Plateau was something that they've put together because they had no WotLK to release in time. So no, major villains aren't used like that all the time. By saying what you've said, you're saying that Halion was the major villain for WotLK (another raid/boss not originally scheduled for it's expansion), which would be wrong.</div></div><hr />

Not, they're not. Or are you going to say that Halion was the major villain for WotLK and LK was the mid boss?<br />
<br />
You're even mixing the Major villains with others that were not major for the warcraft franchise or not even exactly villains for most of the story (really, Malygos? hahaha). Just check your own list, it's like throwing Daredevil with Captain Marvel and saying they're both Marvel heroes, so they're on the same level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also yes malygos was a villian for a long, long time.<br />
<br />
Yes, sure he was.<br />
<br />
Anyway. You've said that Illidan was a mid boss, not a major villain from TBC because Black Temple wasn't the last raid.<br />
<br />
So, by your own standards, Halion was the major villain from WotLK.<br />
<br />
Again, you're just putting &quot;DareDevil&quot; and &quot;Thor&quot; (both heroes) on the same level because they're both... heroes.<br />
<br />
&quot;oh, they're major because they were raid bosses and final raid bosses from those raids!&quot; guess Gruul was a major warcraft franchise villain too. Nightbane... Will of the Emperor... Garrosh... G'huun... Rastakhan...<br />
<br />
They've all had massive storylines, which doesn't mean they were that big for the franchise and that's the point. Blizzard messed with Illidan (and admitted it) and they're doing it again because they just want Sylvannas to be bigger than anything, almost a new LK.</div></div><hr />

so what? The same people that cry about this is the same people who hate wow and dont play it anymore. So why is it even a issue? Play Final fantasy, wow, or heck I dont know, both?<br />
<br />
Its even worse for those who play both games and still bitch about this. Oh no, you get two great content updates for two good games you enjoy, the horror! <br />

Stating that FFXIV is objectively better just ruins your entire argument. I fully agree that BfA is ass but I also think FFXIV is ass. So many systems in that game I dislike ranging from the combat to the storage to the glamour system. Realistically I think everything in BfA outside of raiding has been pretty bad however I think 8.2 does a lot to improve this (essence farming looks fun, benthic gear is farmable gear with currency and no RNG, mechagon is very fun imo, etc) the only problem is the grind for AP is still relegated to islands and I really dislike islands/warfronts.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I think 8.2 is a step in the right direction. Currency gear on a vendor, player power progression that’s completely goal oriented (farming essences), sandbox content in mechagon, etc. There’s still plenty to fix but at the very least it’s a small step forward. That’s not to say I think BfA is good, I don’t, I just disagree about FFXIV being objectively better.</div></div><hr />

Tried FF14 several times. Forcing players to spend 30+ hours to grind through ridiculously boring MSQ (seriously, the majority of them are simple fetch quests or forcing you to wait in a dungeon que for 30 minutes) before you can can access newer content is laughable bad design. I will never try that game again until that shit is fixed. Selling me a potion to skip is not a fix. Blizzard should copy that strategy to artificially increase the amount of &quot;content&quot; in their game.<br />

Objectively is always a hard one, almost nothing can be objectively better or worse. I mean, you can't say GTA is objectively better then Saints Row.

The level 50 MSQ is the only issue I ever had, it's a story based game, the story is a big deal. <br />
<br />
As for customization like wow's talents and such, the game has never had then and never been built around it, so it's not really a problem.

But since literally everything else but those two things are clearable in two afternoons, it ain't worth resubbing for.<br />
<br />
It's astonishing how dull the game becomes when everything gets designed to be fast, easy and instantly accessible. <br />
I don't even need/want better gear, because things are designed to topple over regardless.<br />
<br />
Listening to Ion's dev insight, one gets struck by just how 'locked' the devs are. They are merely following a design pendulum that swings back and forth. Everyone has to be happy, everyone has to reach the latest content, but people need to feel like their effort matters, but someone coming late should get into the latest raid dammit!<br />
<br />
You can't have a long-term, satisfying rewarding RPG experience where rewards have value to you, if your progress is essentially reset every goddamn patch.<br />
I've maybe played a total of 24h gametime since december, due to unsubbing, quick resub in february, then near-instantly giving up again. How many hours will it take for my characters to get ready to jump into 8.2 content? It sure won't be many hours. There's never anything &quot;on the horizon&quot; for my characters. Will my characters even have a reason to go into BoD? Lol nah, old content = removed content.<br />
<br />
Catch-up is fine and is a necessary component. I used to be so excited for catchup gear for my characters, years and years ago, back when my characters weren't nearlike god-status in green gear compared to the content I was doing. <br />
The difference was that back then, that catchup gear actually mattered and made a difference. That catchup gear not only made unlocked content I had yet to be able to see, not merely catapulting me to the very nearest content. There was still a progression ladder with more than two steps on it.<br />
<br />
Now catchup gear is merely a near instant evening-out between old and returning players. What's the difference? Someone asks<br />
The difference is that catchup gear didn't tend to completely take over your gear set, it used to be a few powerful items, that still took a pretty long time to attain. But when you got them you really noticed the difference. <br />
How long will it take a new-dinged 120 alt in 8.2 to get 400+? How much of &quot;all&quot; content can you do with gear you can attain in a couple of afternoons at 120? Pretty much everything I wager, other than high raids or m+. The rest is seasonal, locust-swarm-oriented content that get devoured instantly.<br />
<br />
I wish I had a reason to come back beyond the first two weeks of a new major update.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can only use this tactic when you're in a position of power. I'm not so sure WoW can afford to compete with other MMORPGs at the moment. My guess is that it's going to backfire into Ion's face.</div></div><hr />

You aren’t doing all of the mechagon content in 2hrs. You probably won’t even get it done in a month, lot of shit to do. I’m not sure if it’s the kind of content you’d like but as someone who raids pretty heavily i think outdoor content will be much much better in 8.2. The only thing you’ll complete in 2hrs is the war campaign as long as it’s not gated. You won’t even be able to upgrade your essences that fast, you actually have to work for it. <br />
<br />
I fully understand your complaint but it doesn’t really apply to 8.2. Certainly to 8.0-8.1.5 but essences+benthic gearing+mechagon content will take a lot of time investment without much RNG to gate you as well which is great.<br />

Yeah I don’t know why people are so quick to throw out their opinions as objective facts. If a game is just completely broken (think WoD launch) then yeah the launch of an mmo that isn’t broken would be objectively better. Stating that 1 game is objectively better than another, in this situation, just doesn’t work unfortunately. I can name a lot of things that I dislike about FFXIV, same with WoW, but that’s the exact reason I don’t find FFXIV better. Objectively just doesn’t make sense here, I get the point he was trying to make though so it’s fine.</div></div><hr />

I was obviously being facetious. Saying &quot;objectively good/bad&quot; is an oxymoron. It's like when you start your sentence with &quot;Let's be real...&quot;, &quot;The truth is...&quot; or &quot;Let's be honest...&quot; - you use it when you want others take your opinion as a fact and be an asshole about it.<br />
It's my opinion that FFXIV is a better MMORPG in the year 2019 than WoW. It wasn't earlier, it is now - for me.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to be a felplague here but dude, it's just two weeks after the patch for season 3 to start with the raid and the dungeon (meaning the pacing of the quests will have finished), it's not ten weeks (don't remember the exact number of missions) of one shitty quest each week for daddy khadgar like 7.2<br />

8.2 holds little of anything I'd be interested in.. maybe 8.3 or beyond will be enough to bring me back to the WoW addiction, but it is not this patch.<br />

Because even a monkey with brain damage knows that 8.2 will be the part where they will throw the towel upon this Xpac and move on to 9.0<br />
There is nothing that can be salvaged from BfA in 8.2 in both Lore and Mechanical parts.<br />
<br />
Plus the fact that 8.2 is Unfinished as fuck on the PTR, and now that they will ship it, it will only show that they don't care about BfA at this rate, and they want to guarantee those extra bonuses from the Shareholders.<br />
<br />
I'll save this comment for when they announce 8.3 to make you remember how stupid you sound with so much hate with no thinking<br />

That would be something i would love to see them change, though you really only need to go through it once.</div></div><hr />

It’s bizarre to me that people complain about the game being too easy and accessible but then don’t even participate in high end raiding or high m+ keys which is THE CHALLENGING PART OF THE GAME.<br />

It's my opinion that FFXIV is a better MMORPG in the year 2019 than WoW. It wasn't earlier, it is now - for me.<br />

false, I've read quite a lot of comments of people saying they love it, specially after some upgrades on the PTR. Of course, there are also people who don't like the zone, but hey, we are humans and we can have different opinions about stuff, you are not wrong if it feels dull for you but neither are them if they like the zone.<br />

Okay .. so.. she used the tidestone to invite us to raid her palace??? Why not raise the waters after we got dumped down there and drown everyone?<br />
<br />
Or why not create a Giant tidal wave? Why open a hole directly above her palace? I don't get it.<br />

I can PM you the spoiler of why if you want, but it has an explanation, an obvious one tho, but an explanation</div></div><hr />

You don't get it though. The game has nothing else to do, and the &quot;CHALLENGING PART OF THE GAME.&quot; isn't actually rewarding to play. You get some trivial handouts. You get some trivial armor, weapons or useless tokens and then wait till next week. That's not fun by any normal person's definition.<br />
<br />
Gear that MATTERS when you get it, that isn't made trivial by the next patch, that really does feel like an improvement or at LEAST different from the equipment that you have now... is what makes progress feel real. Doing a bunch of trivial garbage to reach a single activity, the gear grind, which is in itself trivial... that's asinine beyond reason. Ion is a drone. Lore is a drone. No passion, no desire. They're beaten, whipped meat puppets on autopilot as far as I'm concerned.</div></div><hr />

And remember Blizzard admitting that they've screwed things up? From not leaving Illidan as the TBC end boss (but not mid expansion btw, that position is for Kael'thas and Vashj) to wasting a legendary weapon (Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury) as a carrot to keep people interested in Sunwell Plateau.<br />
<br />
Black Temple was the last content originally scheduled for TBC. Sunwell Plateau was something that they've put together because they had no WotLK to release in time. So no, major villains aren't used like that all the time. By saying what you've said, you're saying that Halion was the major villain for WotLK (another raid/boss not originally scheduled for it's expansion), which would be wrong.<br />
<br />
Basically why naxx was &quot;copied&quot; and used as first raid in WOTLK.</div></div><hr />

Also, I hope there is an explanation as to why Azshara sacrifices her main advantage to confront us by using the Tidestone to ... remove water and basically leave her Palace defenseless. Seems like the stupidest plot-convenient move ever.<br />
<br />
there is, there is a fair few reasons.<br />
<br />
because she wants to give us a chance to join her<br />
then wants us to entertain her and weed out some of her weaker subjects who are not worthy.<br />
she needs us to activate our hearts of azeroth against her to free nzoth, cause the whole time magni has been being fooled and we have been helping them by powering up not a necklace, but a key.<br />
then she decides to collapse the waters in on us, but we stop her from doing so.</div></div><hr />

man you're a hateful little sh*t lol first of all looks like you liked the old boring set in stone BiS gear system, good go play classic when it drops and stop complaining about live. Second this is due to the season system, which you might not like but its not this terrible thing like you make it out to be. Progressing gear and becoming stronger is still plenty enjoyable and doing the dificult content is not boring. You had to do similar like before, grind content to get gear. I see no difference except that the cap is raised every patch. So what if you dont have a set in stone BiS, this gives more player freedom to make better combinations of gear. So if you dont even want to play the current game, then quit whining and wait for classic and you can stay stuck in the past there</div></div><hr />

I WISH I had data to back it up, but I don't - nobody has. I think we can all agree WoW is in the worst state it ever was (even considering WoD). Feel free to defend nu-Blizzard and their bad games. I don't care.<br />

You can't use the word 'objectively' in an opinion<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jastall</div><div class="date">2019-06-19, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Way over your head. Sylvanas will, by the end of the expansion, been the focal point of the entire story, a story that's been polarizing and ill-received by the player base at best. Meanwhile, Azshara, a character big enough to be the main villain of her own expansion, was relegated to a mid-expansion patch.<br />
<br />
&quot;Major villain&quot; shouldn't be used as loosely. Kael'thas was a whole other beast. Technically, he shouldn't have been a villain at all, but that's a whole different argument. Azshara has been set up lore-wise to be as big as characters like Kil'jaeden, The Lich King, and Deathwing, power and character-wise. Not on the level of lesser villains like Gul'dan, Zul'jin, or Yogg-saron. Then again, it's not the first time Blizzard fucked up. Lei-shen should have been the final boss of Mists, not Garrosh hopped up on Old God heart juice but that's irrelevant here and now.<br />
<br />
But Blizzard literally said Azshara is the Gul'dan of the expansion, and in terms of scope she's quite similar, being an ambitious powermonger who shack up with evil entities for their own gains. Azshara has been relevant once, 10 000 years ago in-universe and has done little to nothing since apart from sending out Naga mooks for us to butcher. She's hardly more important than Gul'dan, Malygos, Kel'thuzad, KJ, C'thun, Lei Shen, Illidan, Kael'Thas or Yogg-Saron.<br />
<br />
Plus, she doesn't even die in the raid anyway, so she can always play a role later on.</div></div><hr />

I see no difference except that the cap is raised every patch. So what if you don't have a set in stone BiS, this gives more player freedom to make better combinations of gear. So if you don't even want to play the current game, then quit whining and wait for classic and you can stay stuck in the past there<br />
<br />
I hate only lazy game developers too set in their ways, failing to innovate, failing to listen, failing to make FUN experiences that don't involve beating your head against the ceiling. I hated the &quot;BiS gear system&quot; and I loath Classic because of it. That system is highly elitist and does nothing to solve the problem. The gear that was &quot;BiS&quot; was still made trivial when the next expansion released instead of being improvable with crafting and time.<br />
<br />
&quot;Progressing gear and becoming stronger...&quot; is enjoyable so long as the gear is meaningful, worthwhile, non-trivial, which the gear in this game is not. There's nothing to customize, nothing to add, nothing of substance in the gear at all besides trivial little bumps to &quot;trivial main-stat, trivial health-stat, trivial secondary stat 1, trivial secondary stat 2&quot; Not everyone wants to do the same exact thing, let alone week after week, month after month. There are far better systems that could be implemented.<br />
<br />
Seasons is a terrible system for an RPG of any kind. Making everything you just got meaningless because the next &quot;season&quot; has higher stats is not quality, it's not innovative and it disregards all the work you did for the gear you managed to get at the time. That's a terrible system.<br />
<br />
Your entire argument is rage at the simple truth that WoW current and WoW Classic are just made of a vertical one-track progression system and a few facebook games that are just easy-to-make, low-effort, easily maintained systems put in place by a company that suffers greatly from the George Lucas Effect.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't Sunwell Plateau the last patch of BC?</div></div><hr />
