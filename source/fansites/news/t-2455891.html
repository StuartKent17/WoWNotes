<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Missions<br />

<br />
Discipline<br />
<br />
Resolved an issue that caused Power Word: Shield's value to be lower than intended when engaged in combat with enemy players.<br />
Power Word: Shield (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/17-power-word-shield) absorbs an additional 10% when engaged in combat with enemy players.<br />
<br />
Developers’ note: Shadow Priests’ Power Word: Shield was unaffected by the above and is unchanged.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that caused Greater Fade to be removed by Shadowy Apparitions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

FinalBossTV #176 - State of Tanking in Battle for Azeroth<br />
This week FinalBossTV talked to Max, Shakib &amp; Munkky about the state of Tanks in Battle for Azeroth right before Patch 8.1.<br />
<br />

<br />
So does this mean I can get almost full 385 gear by just swapping professions? And 415 in the future?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drynix</div><div class="date">2018-12-13, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Temple of Sethraliss<br />
The Lightning Trap orbs move slower.<br />
Galvazzt lightning has received a new visual and the Pillars are more randomized.<br />
Avatar of Sethraliss can be healed much faster, reducing the length of the encounter.<br />
Kings' Rest<br />
Spectral Berserker can no longer be CC'd.<br />
The Underrot<br />
Blood Matrons can now see through [Stealth].<br />
Freehold<br />
The pig Lightning now drops in a random part of the arena instead of the center.<br />
Trothak's shark has shrunk in size.<br />
Uldir<br />
Uldir bosses on Normal difficulty no longer drop 250x [Azerite].<br />
Fetid Devourer no longer walks, it instead runs.<br />
<br />
Fucking hell why doesn't blizzard report this kinda shit? Thanks to wowpedia I now know what to expect when entering some of those places. Sure, non are massive changes, but its still silly that I have to find out this stuff through outside sources.</div></div><hr />

Believe it only applies to gear you had pre 8.1. Anything crafted since still requires the profession to wear.</div></div><hr />

2 hours is about right, but I am not sure it really would qualify as 'fun'. it did use up 2 of my hours though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Now if you can undo that 40% nerf to Words of Glory? Bit harsh no?<br />
<br />
I didn't notice this till yesterday because I never saw it in class change patch notes. I don't know if I'm blind or it didn't get added until last minute:<br />
<br />
<br />
Word of Glory - Heal yourself and up to 5 friendly targets Heals a friendly target and the 2 most injured targets within 15 30 yards for (1200% 560% of Spell power).<br />
<br />
Heaven forbid that Ret actually brings some utility to groups, even when it's at the expense of their own DPS. Not allowed! Nerf it even deeper into the ground!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Luckily I had enough game-time to do all the content of 8.1. <br />
And with no Azerite knowledge I guess now is a very good time to take a break &gt;.&lt; as they removed any progression left in the game.<br />
<br />
I just wish my guilds raids were cancelled until Jan 22nd as well.</div></div><hr />
