Database Upgrades<br />
With the addition of so many great new features, we wanted to make sure that our infrastructure was in place to fully support them. To that end, we will be performing additional database hardware upgrades prior to the release of Cataclysm. This will allow all players to experience this new expansion as intended.<br />
<br />
While we do not have specific dates to share at this point in time, we will be working to communicate when these upgrades occur to ensure the best possible experiences during this time and continuing into the future. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Let's go back to our old habits, it's blue post time! Ghostcrawler was nice enough to spend a part of his sunday answering players questions about changes to classes in Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
Balancing masteries<br />
Adjusting the third bonus is dangerous, because that is the one tied to mastery rating on gear. If we make that stat too good, then you might want mastery at the expense of crit or haste and get offended if there isn't tons of mastery on your tier sets.<br />
<br />
Adjusting the first two passives, especially the first one, which is just damage for Elemental, is a lot safer. It's not a huge deal if Elemental gets 0.25 % damage per talent point spend and Enhancement gets 0.21 % damage per talent point spent as long as the end result of dps is pretty close.*<br />
<br />
* - &quot;pretty close&quot; will be defined by players as &quot;nobody should ever beat me, irrespective of encounter, gear or my own personal button mashing routine.&quot; :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24261058121/elemental-tree-mastery-dps-increase/))<br />
<br />
Bloodlust/Heroism on more classes<br />
We do want to make sure that 10 player raids can get all of the major buffs a little easier. You should feel like most reasonable comps (3 warriors and 7 rogues is not what we'd consider reasonable) give you all of the major buffs and several of the more minor ones. There will be a little more consolidation than what we've described so far.<br />
<br />
We are scaling back the magnitude of some of the buffs, as we did with Sunder Armor. We want you to feel awesome when you have strong good synergy, but we don't want the buffs to overwhelm say your gear or skill. We're also planning on getting rid of any talent that buffs a buff. Any buff that is earned solely by talent needs to have a selfish component thrown in so that you don't feel like you should respec if someone else with that buff comes along.<br />
<br />
Obviously things like Rebirth can't just be handed to out to more classes unless we did something like a second exhaustion mechanic for battle rez or whatever. For now we're going to try the cooldown at 30 min again. In Icecrown's world of limited attempts, a 30 min cooldown likely meant you just cooled your heels until the cooldown was available again. In Cataclysm the hope is sometimes you'll have the benefit available but not every time, which scales back on how much of a game-changer it is. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24262408332/bloodlust-heroism-fixed-now-kings-turn/))<br />
<br />
Healing Philosophy<br />
I have found this philosophy to be a tough one to communicate. Painted broadly, we have some players who chose healing because they like to be challenged and we have some players who chose healing because they like to be the hero. In LK, raid healing can definitely be stressful at times, but we're not actually convinced the challenge is there. After a tough fight, whether it was succesful or not, ask yourself what you should have done differently. Did you use the wrong heal in the wrong situation? I'd suspect not since most healers have pretty stringent rotations these days where you use your strongest heals on cooldown and fill in the time left with your next strongest heals and so on. Did you heal the wrong person at the wrong time? Probably not because anyone you failed to heal was probably about to die. You probably overhealed a lot because there is little consequence for overhealing.<br />
<br />
Go back and look at a few videos of BC raid encounters. A couple of points may be strking. One, several characters may be at various stages of injury -- the healers could not keep them all topped off. Second, the healers may be at various stages of mana -- in other words, it's not just a matter of having more GCDs before everyone is fine again. It's a matter of triage.<br />
<br />
Triage is one of the things missing from today's healing game (even though you likely learned First Aid through a triage quest). Loosely defined, triage is deciding who needs immediate attention (vs. who is stable vs. who is a lost cause). We want healers to be able to make decisions like &quot;The tank is wounded, but she is unlikely to die in the next few hits, and hots are ticking on her, so she's probably okay for a moment and I can heal this Ret paladin over here,&quot; vs. &quot;The rogue is wounded, but my big heal would overheal for a ton and I need the mana, so I can use a small heal.&quot; We want the dps to likewise be thinking about ways to minimize damage on themselves, not because they'll die in a global (i.e. before they could respond anyway) but because the healers are going to risk running out of mana.<br />
<br />
Today, in LK, healing risks feeling even more like whack-a-mole. Injury? Heal. Injury? Heal. You're testing your reflexes more than your decision-making ability. Whack-a-mole can be challenging, but it doesn't have much depth. It's easy to add depth though. Let's start with the notion that there are two hammers. The little hammer can dispatch most of those moles, but sometimes you can use your big hammer too. The big hammer has limited charges or whatever. Now let's have some of the moles pop out a little slower so that you have time to consider which hammer to use. See where I'm going with this?<br />
<br />
Running out of mana doesn't have to be, and won't be, the only reason you fail an encounter. But it is a point of failure that we don't have today. Adding it back in will make the encounters feel more distinct from each other and will actually, we believe, make healing more interesting and ultimately more fun. I agree it's going to be a tough sell though. In one of our playtests recently, the healer came back frazzled. &quot;I couldn't keep everyone topped off,&quot; she said. &quot;It took me half the dungeon to realize that I didn't have to.&quot; Once that clicked, she said she started having fun. Hopefully it will click with other players quickly too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24038740321/what-a-horrible-philosophy/))<br />
<br />
Arenas<br />
We're not killing off Arenas, nor do we regret introducing them. (Rob said in an interview once that we regretted *how* we introduced them. Big difference.)<br />
<br />
Part of the problem with how we introduced Arena was we offered extremely powerful rewards that were available relatively easily. Everyone I know participated in Arena at the start of BC. Were they having fun? Several of them weren't. But they figured the had to do it to stay competitive. In fact, in BC the PvP rewards were so easy and required such little time per week to get that they threatened to divert a lot of players from raiding to get epics.<br />
<br />
Flash forward to Lich King. We made it harder, in that it took more actual wins, to earn great PvP rewards. At the same time, we made raiding much more accessible. This got a lot of the players who didn't want to participate in Arenas out of there. But it wasn't enough. We still had a lot of players who liked PvP and / or didn't enjoy raiding who still felt like Arenas were there only avenue to great gear. Unfortunately, if they weren't that good, or if they picked a spec that wasn't that good, or they picked a comp that wasn't that good, then they were just spinning their wheels since we no longer offered them great rewards for just losing matches each week.<br />
<br />
The idea behind rated BGs is to be able to offer the best PvP rewards through both Arenas or BGs. If you love BGs but don't like Arenas, you can still get great rewards. If you love Arenas, hopefully the experience will be even better for you because the guys who don't like Arenas will be off doing something else. If you like both Arenas and BGs, great, you have more choices in what you do that week. If you like PvP but still lose a lot, yes you're still going to be a season behind the guys who win a lot. We'll reward you gear just for participating, but if you want th best gear, you still need to win. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24261117256/so-i-guess-blizz-is-killing-off-arena/))<br />

Late Cataclysm class preview for Paladins<br />
We figured no matter who was last they were going to feel victimized. You shouldn't try and interpret too much by the order of the previews though. The fact is we're just not as far along on paladins as we are the other classes. We find it easier to work on a few classes at a time rather than say work on one class on Monday then a different class on Tuesday and keep rotating through them. We didn't pick paladin last because we hate them or because they need the most work or the least work or anything. It's pretty much totally random.<br />
<br />
We haven't torn up the paladin talent trees in earnest yet, so the preview will likely be heavy on design intent and light on details. One of the changes we'll continue to emphasize with Retribution is trading more defenses for offense. A defensive dps spec just doesn't work really well in WoW.

Actually, Paladins do require the most redesign, considering their current design vision of fun. Tons of multiplier talents =|= fun.<br />
<br />
I had high hopes in the preview, but considering Paladins are the last class to get reviewed again and they still have no clue wtf they are doing, it's going to be WotLK all over again:<br />

Being ignored for most of the time, getting some last-minute changes without much testing, resulting in massive QQ, ridiculously fast hotfixes due to being overpowered and crappy band aids which don't solve core problems at all after realising they overdid their nerfs.</div></div><hr />

But this is World of WARcraft. Why would you even need a ranking system in the first place? You do know that most of the balance problems with pvp came from Arenas.<br />
<br />
This is what he wrote:<br />
We didn't engineer the game and classes and balance around it, we just added it on, so it continues to be very difficult to balance. Is WoW a PvE cooperative game, or a competitive PvP game? There's constant pressure on the class balance team, there's pressure on the game itself, and a lot of times players who don't PvP don't understand why their classes are changing. I don't think we ever foresaw how much tuning and tweaking we'd have to do to balance it in that direction.</div></div><hr />

WoW is a faster paced game but a little thought and awareness during fights about the skills being used and who they are being used on sounds more interesting than staring at global cool downs of the one or two actually useful skills presently. Recently in dungeons I've grouped with healers who aren't even totally paying attention to the game and keep everyone alive just by clicking occasionally. <br />

I gotta say the new healing changes looks like a great deal of fun i theory. The problem is all the idiotic Dps you will have to handle. HEAL!!! will be heard alot in the beginning of the expansion. Healer will also have to take mana breaks...*gasp*. It will be horrible for the new &quot;dungeons shouldn't take more then 15 min&quot; population. <br />
<br />
I'm looking foward to it though, hope we get some CC yet again also and heroics might actually feel a bit heroic.</div></div><hr />

We still had a lot of players who liked PvP and / or didn't enjoy raiding who still felt like Arenas were there only avenue to great gear. Unfortunately, if they weren't that good, or if they picked a spec that wasn't that good, or they picked a comp that wasn't that good, then they were just spinning their wheels since we no longer offered them great rewards for just losing matches each week.&quot; /quote<br />

<br />
if you suck at arena (not knowing if your comp is vaild counts as sucking) then go RAID !! its not that hard, if you fail at something, either practise and become good or leave it be! high rated arena isnt for the average casual, just like LK hardmodes will not be done by scubs..</div></div><hr />

The biggest community wide adaptation everyone, not just healers, will have to make is GC's mantra of (paraphrasing) &quot;the healer's job is to keep everyone above 0%, not at 100%&quot;. Currently, even I find my inner alarms firing if a DPS is &quot;hurt&quot; for longer than five seconds, because of the threat of insta-gibbing. Hopefully everyone will adapt quickly to the idea that you can be less than 100% and still &quot;safe&quot;... but we all know that adaptation may be too much to ask to many of today's players. <br />
<br />
I recommend everyone do what my posse is going to do: Don't PUG that much until the new vision has sunk in. Keep it tight, learn among friends, and get comfortable with the new way of things before you subject yourself to the randomness of cross server PUGing.</div></div><hr />

Late Cataclysm class preview for Paladins<br />
We figured no matter who was last they were going to feel victimized. You shouldn't try and interpret too much by the order of the previews though. The fact is we're just not as far along on paladins as we are the other classes. We find it easier to work on a few classes at a time rather than say work on one class on Monday then a different class on Tuesday and keep rotating through them. We didn't pick paladin last because we hate them or because they need the most work or the least work or anything. It's pretty much totally random.<br />
<br />
We haven't torn up the paladin talent trees in earnest yet, so the preview will likely be heavy on design intent and light on details. One of the changes we'll continue to emphasize with Retribution is trading more defenses for offense. A defensive dps spec just doesn't work really well in WoW.

Paladin Change Preview:<br />
We removed blessing of freedom<br />
You can't directly heal anymore but you can hot yourself<br />
You can't bubble u now take 50% less dmg instead for 3 seconds.<br />
We Toned down your burst and gave you more consistant dmg.<br />

Like nowadays for fives you can get 1.4k teams VS 2.1k teams... imagine on AV. And how in the world are you even considering comparing skill or anything to rate people in BGs. It will either be an epic fail or simply a walk in the park for people to get gear even by auto-attacking... There is simply too much variables for it to be fair VS real skill needed in arenas.<br />

Ok then so I guess we should get a triumph badge for every 10th wipe then on an end-wing boss in ICC? Honestly if they put the bolded in there will be even more AFKers or give-up-easilies, which is very bad for BGs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think there is going to be a LOT of number crunching they have planned out.<br />
Things like:<br />
Say in WSG if one side wins 3-0 in 10mins, the guy on autoattack off to the side of the map is not going to get more &quot;points&quot; as the guy that did 40k dmg to the FC that was healbotted down the field.<br />
Or the healer on the losing side that healed the FC/purged harmful spells, but he died anyway.<br />
Things more along the lines of how much did you do to help your team, even in a losing cause.<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll have a 'zone' marked off in front of each teams GY, and give negative points to people who are in that 'zone' for 3+mins straight, obviously not helping play the game how it was meant to be played.<br />
<br />
So many variables that I can't even think of, but I'm sure they have.<br />
<br />
I think it's going to be variables like that, that give people higher ranks, instead of the vanilla stats on the stats page (killing blows/hk's/dmg done/etc.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes... this is what Blizzard offered holy paladins in the entire of WOTLK. Removing downranking IS the reason healing became so &quot;easy&quot; in WOTLK. The classes lost most of their tools to actually cope with diffrent min/max content. And.. only SOME of the healing classes could actually use some of their tools while others had NO TOOLS at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In other words... they havn't started working on the paladin class yet... 1 week after the other classes have gotten their preview. No... Paladins should not feel victimized over other classes....<br />
<br />
Funny how things become totally random more often with some classes than others. Maybe some of the random thinking is also the reason why the paladins have been the class that has gone through alot of extra changes just few days before content goes life... or even in a hotfix after it goes life.<br />
<br />
Is it normal work ethic to finish 9 classes and then leave one totally without thinking... and now it even seems that the &quot;preview&quot; will not even have the same amount of detail that the other classes got. <br />
<br />
I agree it doesn't mean BLizzard hates the class... but it shows a total lack of commitment and really bad workethic. There is no excuse for it... <br />
<br />
Basicly this means that the paladin class will ONCE again go into beta progress WITHOUT even a basic structure of skills - abilites and talent trees.. And no.. there is nothing RANDOM about that...</div></div><hr />

To quote a friend<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Public&quot; is kind of a generous term to describe the WoW community, don't you think? I mean, this is a group of people who, collectively:<br />
<br />
- When they are given free items, complain that the items are not cool enough<br />
- Want challenging, difficult gameplay with complex mechanics, with a deep backstory that perfectly adheres to established lore, that they can complete within a week<br />
- Want unique, difficult to obtain gear and items they can receive by pushing an &quot;I Win&quot; button<br />
- Class mechanics that are perfectly balanced for all imaginable forms of PvP and PvE content, which nonetheless will be able to dominate everyone else in any given situation<br />
- Will curse the family of anyone even peripherally involved with the game when they do not get these things within 5 minutes after their forum post<br />
<br />
Personally, instead of Public I probably would have gone with &quot;mindless horde&quot; or &quot;slavering idiots&quot;, but whatever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
To be fair, most other classes didn't get that much exposition in their FAQs. As a tree druid all I learned is that Tree form is being changed to an uncertain buff on a cooldown. I'm pretty sure they've sat down with most classes/specs and decided their general philosophy.<br />
<br />
Anyway, about the blue posts as a whole, they make interesting reading. Just to take a long view of it, it's great to see that a team such as Blizzard communicate their design philosophy with the general audience rather than just randomly update stuff. And whereas there's often a lot of undeserved QQ (&quot;OMG THEY'RE NERFING US!!&quot; when the slightest hint of a change is announced) when they sift through it the community does have some interesting dialogue that I'm sure gets taken into account. I'm almost certain that some Blizzard employee will read this thread at some point to see what our general reaction is.<br />
<br />
As a healer I'm really interested to hear about the healing philosophy. It definitely does feel like whack a mole at the moment. The closest thing that comes to healer coordination at the moment is &quot;tank / offtank raid&quot; designations - and I remember back in Ulduar HMs designating different groups for resto druids to put hots on. These days it's just a massive mess of heal whatever you can. It's not just whack a mole, it's playing multiplayer whack a mole with 4-5 other people. And there's no strategy, just hit the first thing you spy. The reflex to get to a certain target first feels like you're competing with other healers rather than working with them (especially in PUGs where there's always competitive tension to top the healing meters).</div></div><hr />

This means paladins, although they may not break it to you in the preview, they are going to tear your talent trees up. Also for defenses to offenses, ret pallies prepare to find blizz stating in the preview, 'Divine Shield and Divine Protection are now talents deep within the Protection tree, to comfort you we will now give you a new ability called Hammer of the Righteous, it does the exact same thing thing as Hammer of Justice and shares cooldown with it, but to make sure this isnt to overpowered the cooldown for both abilities has been increased by 10 minutes.'</div></div><hr />

That's nothing exclusive to the WoW population though; those lines could cover a significant proportion of humanity.<br />
<br />
- if you give people something free, some will complain that it isn't cool enough<br />
- if you give people something challenging, some will whine if they don't complete it fast enough<br />
- if you say people can have a cool, unique reward for doing something some will want an even easier way to get it<br />
- if you ever manage to balance all aspects of something, some people will still want to win at it with as little personal effort as possible<br />
- and some people will whine if they don't get what they want, NAO!<br />

I've been barely able to get 1800 and i love BGs but still this is such a crappy idea, No BG requires any skill its just &quot;AMG ZERG MIDDLE AND HOPE YOU DONT DIE IN 2SEC&quot; or &quot;AFK BEHIND A TREE&quot;.<br />
<br />
Still i agree that it should reward set gear but... not better than arenas...<br />
<br />
Atleast arenas require skill(Well ok there are couple 2s zerg teams but HP increased by 300% should fix this in cata). Also, balancing classes around BG will buttrape arenas.</div></div><hr />

How would it have made paladins unhappy if they got their class preview in the same week as others ? Or why were the class previews not delayed one week cause they were not including every class ? Since the date for Cata hasn't been announched .. it shouldn't have mattered to delay it for one week ? <br />
<br />
No.. the fact is that there has NO work been done on paladins. Absolutly ZERO. And they are gonna deside in one week what they are gonna put into the preview - But they will be NO closer what they are actually going to do. Just like the Blue already posted.</div></div><hr />

Still i agree that it should reward set gear but... not better than arenas...<br />
<br />
Atleast arenas require skill(Well ok there are couple 2s zerg teams but HP increased by 300% should fix this in cata). Also, balancing classes around BG will buttrape arenas.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is wrong. Have you really never been in a BG where one side just totally outclassed the other and dominated them all the way to a humiliating loss? Do you think that is because the other side was better at zerging the middle, or maybe because they hid behind trees AFKing better? No, I think it's more because skilful team play in BGs is rewarded versus brainless zerging or selfish AFKing.<br />
<br />
The point behind rated BGs is to encourage the kind of play that is not zerging and AFKing. That should be so obvious that it goes without saying, but I guess some people are so wedded to arenas that they'd prefer to make no sense at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arenas = easy<br />
<br />
Afking at AV for best PvP gear = Hard<br />
<br />
??????????<br />
<br />
Rated BGs will kill wow pvp, every just 85 dinged 10v polish clicker(Nothing against the polish) can get the best gear by afking at a BG... GG. <br />
<br />
If you could only get the previous season gear(So right now it would be Rele) with BGs then it would be just fine but...<br />
<br />
<br />
This post is pointless. At least we got some warning with the poster's handle.<br />
<br />
The blue post said that in order to get the best gear, you'd have to win. Does a team that AFKs win?<br />
<br />
Rated BGs will kill WoW PvP, huh? Well, Nostradamus, perhaps you can put us all out of our misery and reveal Blizzard's plans for Paladins in the expansion, since you seem to have a direct line to the future.<br />
<br />
And what was with the Polish thing? You have nothing against Polish people, and yet you singled them out as the clickers most likely to benefit from rated BGs? That's either highly surreal or poorly disguised ignorance. Given the rest of your post, I'm going with the latter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.. the fact is that there has NO work been done on paladins. Absolutly ZERO. And they are gonna deside in one week what they are gonna put into the preview - But they will be NO closer what they are actually going to do. Just like the Blue already posted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really how do you know there has been no work on Paladins. Do you work for blizzard. Have you been in the office watching them not doing shit. No you haven't. Maybe just maybe the reason why it is taking so long is so they dont have the same problems that paladins have been plagued with before. But no your to much of a whiny bitch arent you. Just shut up and wait. Just be happy that they dont delete your class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He says arenas will be fine given the changes to RMP... because less people will be playing in arenas. <br />
So since less people will care, it's somehow less of an issue if one comp is completely dominant?<br />
<br />
He says shaman shouldn't be angry about bloodlust being given to another class, no unique buffs and all that. Okay... but how do you justify it being an improved version of bloodlust.<br />
<br />
And whichever class is last will feel victimized? I'm not sure its so much being last as being an entire week later. That's not ranking-position thing, that's a temporal distance thing. <br />
http://funmeme.com/image.axd?picture=Stink-Jeffrey-Class-Photo.jpg<br />
And I'm not sure anyone really felt victimized as much as antsy, that is until GC said that Pallies aren't a week later because they need more work, but rather, because they just haven't gotten around to it yet, so don't expect much.</div></div><hr />

Late Cataclysm class preview for Paladins<br />
We figured no matter who was last they were going to feel victimized. You shouldn't try and interpret too much by the order of the previews though. The fact is we're just not as far along on paladins as we are the other classes. We find it easier to work on a few classes at a time rather than say work on one class on Monday then a different class on Tuesday and keep rotating through them. We didn't pick paladin last because we hate them or because they need the most work or the least work or anything. It's pretty much totally random.<br />
<br />
We haven't torn up the paladin talent trees in earnest yet, so the preview will likely be heavy on design intent and light on details. One of the changes we'll continue to emphasize with Retribution is trading more defenses for offense. A defensive dps spec just doesn't work really well in WoW.

<br />
<br />
In other words... they havn't started working on the paladin class yet... 1 week after the other classes have gotten their preview. No... Paladins should not feel victimized over other classes....<br />
<br />
Funny how things become totally random more often with some classes than others. Maybe some of the random thinking is also the reason why the paladins have been the class that has gone through alot of extra changes just few days before content goes life... or even in a hotfix after it goes life.<br />
<br />
Is it normal work ethic to finish 9 classes and then leave one totally without thinking... and now it even seems that the &quot;preview&quot; will not even have the same amount of detail that the other classes got. <br />
<br />
I agree it doesn't mean BLizzard hates the class... but it shows a total lack of commitment and really bad workethic. There is no excuse for it... <br />
<br />
Basicly this means that the paladin class will ONCE again go into beta progress WITHOUT even a basic structure of skills - abilites and talent trees.. And no.. there is nothing RANDOM about that...<br />
<br />
<br />
This.<br />
<br />
For some reason, Ghostcrawler and the dev team never has and never will care about paladins.<br />
<br />
Sure, Resto druids didn't learn much, but resto druid is a Spec, not a class.</div></div><hr />

We believe it because we've always gotten the short end of the stick, whether or not they've actually been doing this intentionally is irrelevant.<br />

OMG you really think you have gotten the short end of the stick REALLY?!? your entire class is a joke. Take paly tanking. you can hold onto 20 million mobs at once without trying. Healer screws up no big deal you have a free death every 2 minutes. then there is Holy the one spell wonder. all you need is enough int and you can heal for days. lastly ret whose rotation is basically smashing your face across the keyboard and things are dead. you want to talk about a class who has got the short end of the stick time and time again, warriors. They have been nerfed time and time again. so before you cry omg blizzard hates us try playing some other class that doesnt have 20 lives.</div></div><hr />

Would this stick be the one that made you lol bubble hearth lay on hands bubble heal 3 lives unkillable in vanilla?<br />
Or was it the part in vanilla where kings allowed alliance pve to race ahead of the horde?<br />
Is the short end of the stick the one that gave you beacon, which makes all other tank healers obsolete?<br />
Or the stick that made them the dominant tank healers in TBC?<br />
Or put rets DPS right below the rogues through most of wrath?<br />
Or made pallys the dominant healer of choice for most of wraths 5v5 comps?<br />
The one that gave prot tanks the free no button required get out of death free card?<br />
The one that made TBC heroics &quot;lfg, need 3 CC&quot; ... unless you had a pally tank, in which case it was fine?<br />
Was it the short stick that gave you spellpower plate on bosses made for you and only you?<br />
Did this short stick make it so a pally tank was about 5 times better in Mt. Hyjal and 3 times better in Black Temple than the other tanks?<br />
Or did you feel offended that you could only 1v5 for the last few months of TBC and only the first third or so of wrath with bubble wings?<br />
Or could 100-0 people in a stun in about 5 seconds for a third of wrath and 2 months of TBC?<br />
Did you think that old comic showing the paladin with divine laser beams and pally only +WIN gems was being ironic?<br />

^ This.<br />
<br />
Honestly, this post is epic.<br />
<br />
We can speculate and fight about who has more power than whom because it really is more fun to say the guy who killed you, or landed the heal before you, or who beat you on the damage meter, naturally has something that you don't... but it usually isn't true.<br />
<br />
At work I do this all the time. Stuff gets stopped and started, and some things that are easier fixes get fixed before things that are hard fixes. For example, ret paladins. So many of their talents are passive, percentage rate increases. They've stated they want to get away from this, but it's worked so deep into the ret paladin's nature that it's going to be frigging tough to work loose, and still replace it with something that works, and which isn't just a new face on the same problem.<br />
<br />
Give em time. I'm anxiously awaiting the update, but once it gets here I know whatever it is will be good. Bliz has a history of taking their sweet time at things, and the results are usually better off for it.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately... changes in policies always have unforeseen consequences. And that'll work out in time too. It's wrong to judge a decision by the time spent growing into the change.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2010-04-13, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG you really think you have gotten the short end of the stick REALLY?!? your entire class is a joke. Take paly tanking. you can hold onto 20 million mobs at once without trying. Healer screws up no big deal you have a free death every 2 minutes. then there is Holy the one spell wonder. all you need is enough int and you can heal for days. lastly ret whose rotation is basically smashing your face across the keyboard and things are dead. you want to talk about a class who has got the short end of the stick time and time again, warriors. They have been nerfed time and time again. so before you cry omg blizzard hates us try playing some other class that doesnt have 20 lives. <br />
<br />
<br />
Tanking: Blizzard has already admitted that consecration is an issue and it's going to be changed in some way. Personally I'm hoping they remove the Ardent Defender proc and give tankadins another cooldown button.<br />
<br />
Healing: 6 buttons minimum. Flash of Light, Holy Shock, Holy Light, Judgment, Beacon of Light, Sacred Shield. There are others but I think that points out how wrong you are enough.<br />
<br />
Dps: I've never played it so I can't really comment, but the fact that a dps rotation macro exists worries me.<br />
<br />
There are issues with paladins but they're nowhere near as bad as you think. Go level one and find out for yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
loh emtied your manapool, and had 1h cd, ye it was a good spell in vanilla :) and bubble+HS is unstopable combo indeeed :D<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or was it the part in vanilla where kings allowed alliance pve to race ahead of the horde?<br />
<br />
it was salvation more than kings, but shamans were super mega FROST SHOCK at the moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is the short end of the stick the one that gave you beacon, which makes all other tank healers obsolete?<br />
<br />
this same spell prevents palas from normal raid healing, or lack of any aoe heal.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or the stick that made them the dominant tank healers in TBC?<br />
<br />
all clases can heal tanks. period.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or put rets DPS right below the rogues through most of wrath?<br />
<br />
scewed facts are not entirely true.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or made pallys the dominant healer of choice for most of wraths 5v5 comps?<br />
<br />
5v5 is srs bzns.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The one that gave prot tanks the free no button required get out of death free card?<br />
<br />
so that one thing is OP, i admit it. But palas needed seconds tanking cd.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The one that made TBC heroics &quot;lfg, need 3 CC&quot; ... unless you had a pally tank, in which case it was fine?<br />
<br />
yep, heroics is always a valid reason to argue about.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Was it the short stick that gave you spellpower plate on bosses made for you and only you?<br />
<br />
failing class design is not short stick of anyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Did this short stick make it so a pally tank was about 5 times better in Mt. Hyjal and 3 times better in Black Temple than the other tanks?<br />
<br />
on trash. yep trash is what matters in raids. good that it drops the legionaries too.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or did you feel offended that you could only 1v5 for the last few months of TBC and only the first third or so of wrath with bubble wings?<br />
<br />
that was before arena started so calling stuff OP in BGs is irrelevant till they are rated.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or could 100-0 people in a stun in about 5 seconds for a third of wrath and 2 months of TBC?<br />
<br />
being OP for two months while leveling is srs bzns also.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you think that old comic showing the paladin with divine laser beams and pally only +WIN gems was being ironic?<br />
<br />
shamans gem haste only and pew pew lazors moar.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If that's your idea of the short end of the stick, I'd hate to see what you consider &quot;a bit in paladins favor&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
no it's trolling that is evil and some kind of grieving to the whole world :)</div></div><hr />

Stop acting like all pallies are pvp ret.<br />
Holy needs a buff to be better at raid healing.<br />
Prot doesn't need a buff, but definitely doesn't need a nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pre tbc <br />
<br />
healers where easy to be killed when there doing pvp and in the same time they didn't fail at raiding because they used to make really low damage and good healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tbc <br />
<br />
healers where gods that some times an arena fight can last well..almost for ever and become boring,no one could just kill a healer only if he can heal him self or if he was trying to kill that healer with a partner.<br />
<br />
Wotlk<br />
<br />
healers never die unless you nuke them down before the cc is over [cheep shut kindye shut deep freeze counter spell] or else switch and do it again until the mage is oom.<br />
if a melee attacks a healer [lets say that melee got healing reduction ability] he well have to run behinde that super healer for 6-10minutes and kill him before his healer end up oom.<br />
<br />
and ofc a blue post would tell me this when they read my post <br />
Why we need healing to be good? <br />
because if we make healers heal less than they are now raid progressing would fail[and they totally escape from the main issue which is why we need to group up to kill a healer]<br />
<br />
why make players depend on healers?make healers depend on players [when i say players i mean Dps classes such as warrior/rogue/hunter etc..] <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ARENA<br />
such as epic fail as arena that is entirely in the need for no skills what so ever,all what you have to do is choosing the right class and nuke down other players all day long <br />
2v2 3v3 5v5.<br />
you said [well lol we regrade the way we did introduced arena because in tbc gear was easy to obtain<br />
<br />
yeah it should be hard...for noobs only and easy for skilled people only ,doesn't mean that few players got the full epic gear in a month that arena is too easy or the gear is easy to obtain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree, and im unfortunately a druid healer. druids are constanly casting and as raid heals the mana spent vs mana gained is sad. unlike other classes i have 0 mana gain off crits so have to stack mp5 to try and keep up while priests and pallies are pretty much just conserving mana. which is why i generally get more healing and quite often less overhealing, since if i dont heal both tanks and the raid as raid heals the tanks or dps die. gg blizz. those pallies runnin oom btw, are actually healing like they should and keeping the tanks up when the boss hits soft enrage, unlike 80% of them that just conserve mana. Right now either tank heals run oom or raid heals do, nerf it more and itll be bad. Of course those who are in full 25 heroic icc gear usually cant remember how it was when expansion came out or werent there, and the mass lack of resto druids. I'll be doing the same thing that i did when wotlk came out, wait till they fix the nerf on healers before healing again and just do kitty dps till its fixed. did 5.3k in the lame heroic gear as kitty dps if i could shred and 3.5k when i couldnt when naxx was still big, probably will be about the same kinda dps in this one.</div></div><hr />

I currently play a paladin however i still havent lost my roots i keep my pre tbc char with pvp rank leveled every expansion. I am a paladin, i do not whine. If your going to cry over nerfs go get the skill to make up for it. Skill = Gear &gt; nerfs.</div></div><hr />
