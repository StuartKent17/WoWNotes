Val'anyr - Hammer of the Ancient Kings<br />
The proc is probably better than you guys are assuming (even for druids). I'm not going to spoil it though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137530621-explain-valanyr-please.html))<br />
<br />
Keyring-like bag for Tabards?<br />
While we have the vendor in the game that sells a bunch of them and they are very cheap, it's possible we will add something in the future that is like the keyring, but there is no eta on this at this time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/16474111948-tabard-of-the-achiever.html))<br />
<br />
World Bosses in Northrend<br />
We don't have anything definitely planned for these in Northrend right now. They have their pluses and minuses as players are very limited in experiencing them as it only takes a couple of top guilds on a realm to farm them and nobody else ever seems them. At the same time they can be fairly quick and easy to implement and provide an additional thing to do for some players.<br />
<br />
It's possible we will add more in the future but we will have to wait and see. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16473612974-world-bosses.html))<br />
<br />
Burst damage in PvP<br />
The term &quot;Burst&quot; has kind of taken on a life of it's own, much like &quot;scaling&quot; and &quot;stealth nerf.&quot; It's not a bad word. Too much burst is bad, just like too much CC, too much healing or too much mana regeneration are bad.<br />
<br />
Burst on demand is a useful mechanic. But we don't think the matches are as fun when someone just crushes your face in while you have very limited options in countering it.<br />
<br />
It can be frustrating to be crowd controlled too much, but at least in that situation every player has a trinket, and many classes have additional ways to break out. Being blown up in just a few GCDs doesn't leave you a lot of options, and it often doesn't even require much skill or finesse from the burster. On the opposite extreme, not being able to finish someone off before a heal lands, means that fights go on forever. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474243009-gc-why-is-burst-such-a-bad-word.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=700) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid))<br />
Potential changes to Innervate<br />
A change to scaling % of mana would be good for all the druid specs. A flat non-scaling number is more problematic in the long run, since eventually a new expansion will come out with new #'s, and you'd have to balance how much mana it gave at each rank, and would be a pain in the neck.<br />
I was actually talking more about a flat number (or a relatively flat number). If it’s a percentage then it still risks being too good in PvE and too weak in PvP. In this case the difference in mana pools is the whole problem, so scaling the amount regenerated to the size of your pool doesn’t fix the disparity. (It would be different if say the PvP boomkin had less mana but also cheaper spells.)<br />
<br />
It would have small scaling problems for the next few content patches, but I don’t think we are going to see many druids with 40K mana anytime soon. Long-term we could always add ranks (the way Wrath has ranks) to keep it scaling at higher (or lower) levels. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474162276-pvp-moonkin-mana-regen-is-utterly-broken.html))<br />
<br />
[...] The cooldown is long, and that is something we would consider lowering if we continue to see mana problems. We just want to be cautious, because such a change would just mean free mana for a raid. You may not be running out of mana healing Ulduar, but the healers on the hard modes are. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474162276-pvp-moonkin-mana-regen-is-utterly-broken.html))<br />
<br />
Innervate and Balance Druids<br />
I don’t think many Balance druids were stacking spirit for its benefit to Innervate. Crit is almost as good as spirit for regen, and when you consider its non-regen benefits, you probably will want it over spirit every chance you can get. Longer term we might look at something like Lunar Guidance or Dreamstate tying into spirit instead of int. However as I said (was it above or in another thread?) we need to make sure we’re happy with the way spirit works overall before we monkey around with it too much. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474162276-pvp-moonkin-mana-regen-is-utterly-broken.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Changes to Paladin mechanics<br />
I started with &quot;That's a fair point&quot; because the OP mentioned that paladins have more to contend with than just maximizing damage. They do have heals, bubbles, cleansing and similar mechanics going on. That is why I said we can't take something as complex as a rogue's combat system and shoehorn it in for Ret.<br />
<br />
But we can (and most likely will) change up the basic Seal, Judge, DS, CS, Exorcism buttons so that they can't all be brought to bear at once AND to make pushing those buttons a little more interesting from the paladin's point of view.<br />
<br />
The model of &quot;I bring burst&quot; is not a good one for the game. You can counter stuns and bubbles and heals and even people running away from you. You can't counter someone unloading five digits of damage within just a few GCDs. That makes the combat shallow and frustrating. We're not convinced that is all Rets are about (because they do have heals, bubbles, cleansing and similar mechanics), but if we think the damage mechanics are too easy to counter, then we will compensate in other ways.<br />
<br />
This isn't anything you will see get hotfixed in next week. I am more trying to explain our thought process so that the Exorcism change makes a little more sense in context. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16473622306-concerns-about-ret.html))</div></div><hr />

It has better stats than any Ulduar weapon PLUS a proc which makes it one tier higher than any ulduar weapon is. Shouldn't be legendaries be just one tier higher than any other epic weapon anyway? The stats are totally fine.<br />

Maybe it was accidental and they will hopefully change it because I am pretty sure most spirit healers would prefer an ilvl 239 mace with spirit. Though I am sure everyone wants a legendary too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">memento</div><div class="date">2009-04-24, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder how the 15% shield works with Druid HoTs or AoE heals?<br />
<br />
15% of the sum of all ticks would be amazing but somehow i doubt that.<br />
Its also very situational. 15% of a 10k heal have a chance to create a shield for 1,5k for 15sec. So its mostly good for a healing target that receives regular damage like a tank. For group healing it does not seem very efficient. But that finally depends on the question of its percent chance and its cooldown.<br />
<br />
Otherwise its a bit underwhelming. No spirit, no manareg at all, not so much more spellpower than Ulduars other maces. Ok it got plenty of crit (yeah) and haste (yuck) but I miss something... well... legendary.<br />
Also glad i passed on it for our priest. Like 90% of the trinkets it seems to be made for direct heals</div></div><hr />

For 15 seconds EVERY direct heal, AE included, that you cast is pretty much indirectly increased by 15%. It's like 15% healing that CAN'T over heal.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it was accidental and they will hopefully change it because I am pretty sure most spirit healers would prefer an ilvl 239 mace with spirit. Though I am sure everyone wants a legendary too. <br />

So for the 15 seconds that Blessing of ancient kings is active, every heal you cast will be sending bubbles out, so its probably more ideal for a spammy-heal class like Holy paladins / Resto shamans, also the lack of Spirit makes it less ideal for the other healing classes (IMO, probably just saying that because im an RShaman :P).</div></div><hr />

Its a 239 epic, compared to a 226 epic. Its not going to have 36274272 more stats. If it had crit instead of mp5, 19 mp5 is about the same as 46 crit in terms of item budget.<br />
<br />
I really don't see any problem. The Algalon ring is more regen oriented then the KT ring.<br />
<br />
I think people were expecting Algalon to have level 252 loot or something. It seems instead his entire loot table is 239. Even hard modes generally only drop one 239 item, so his loot is still the best.</div></div><hr />

All I read here is BAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW<br />
<br />
The mace found will be fine for all healer classes. proc &gt; some spirit/mp5. If losing spirit and/or mp5 on your weapon is the deal breaker, I think you need to look at yourself, not how the mace is itemized.<br />
<br />

Doing the math, there is no way that any guild (Even Ensidia or Vodka) could have all 30 of these fragments by now. Did Blizzard purposely put it in the armory so people would start QQing?(Unlikely). Or did Blizzard hand one of these bad boys out to someone?<br />
<br />
<br />
While GM's have a Test Realm where they can do some fun stuff (in europe at least) they sometimes create items on the real realms. Tha tis why you sometimes can link Martin Thunder and other items. So my guess is that a GM tried it or the quest on a live realm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK then, a lot of people (especially going from this thread) expected at least two versions - a paladin's healing gear is so vastly different from that of a druid for example - I don't think you can make a legendary that's good for all healing classes without being overpowered, and that mace, as it is now, is heavily weighted towards paladins/shamans over priests/druids, indicating that there might well be at least one other version.<br />
<br />
And Syklla - I'm a tank. Why would I qq over a healing item? All I'm saying is that it might be not the only version, because it appears to be signifigantly better for ~half of the healing classes compared to others. As for Algalon rewards; having no socket bonuses on coloured sockets and having no tank version seems a bit of a bad job to me, when all other coloured sockets have bonuses, and almost all other end boss handins have a version for each type of char.</div></div><hr />

That hardly made any sense - but first of all Crit/Haste are not offensive stats, they're decent healing stats for anyone but druids.<br />

You guys are acting as if all previous Legendaries were so homogenized....<br />
<br />
Not like Glaives benefitted all physical dps'ers the same, or the bow, or the mace, or the 1h sword...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draco cracona</div><div class="date">2009-04-25, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But the thing is, you could see the stats of those legendaries when you decided who would get them, people seeing it drop (assuming spoilerless/early people getting the shards) only have the class restrictions to go by - and that just tells you it's probably some kind of healer item. If it turns out to be signifigantly worse for druids than other healers like it is now, that's thirty shards you just gave to a druid that would be much better served on a paladin or shaman. Blizz have already set a precedent for this scenario with Atiesh; this is a place where this makes much more sense than trying to create a homogenized legendary for four specs who aren't all homogenized.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The only thing that made Thunderfury and Warglaives significantly better than other options were the procs. The stats weren't overwhelmingly better compared to epics, except for the proc. <br />
<br />
Absolutely.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't see why it would be surprising if the same is true of the mace. The proc is 15 seconds of 15% more healing that can't overheal (For almost any difficult encounter, you can virtually be assured the shield will be consumed before it wears off). That is quite a bit. <br />
<br />
The proc is probably better than you guys are assuming (even for druids). I'm not going to spoil it though. :) <br />

It is intended for healers, and is obviously better for them. Unless every healer in the raid already has this mace (Thats pretty far down the track, I think we can agree) the shard shouldn't go to dps. Not only would you have to be in a raid where every healer has this already. You would have to have that happen 25 times (or 30, cant remember). Its just not gonna happen anytime soon, and if it does then someone is being very selfish. Get off this item dps casters, wait your turn, you/we (I play a mage so I hope so) should be next in line anyways.</div></div><hr />

The proc isnt that great, you wont stop overhealing your tank. So it will absorb 1,5k dmg if you heal for 10k and it procs, but your overheal will be just up to 1,5k higher.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW the proc chance is listed at 10% on wowhead for the spell which seems perfectly reasonable to me. 45 sec internal cd also i'd imagine because after all it is blizzard. if wowhead is wrong in guessing about 5-6% proc chance with no CD since blizzard obviously wants icecrown epics to outclass this, otherwise they would do the 10% proc with no internal cd</div></div><hr />

Looking at 25 Malygos, what do tanks get ? 0 drops and a quest necklace... yep.<br />
since Blizz gave prot pally's a dress,<br />
gave mages some pants instead of the robe,<br />
no tank rings with Dalaran port,<br />
no tank rewards from Algalon quest (the most epic quest ever)<br />
I'm 99% sure that Algalon will drop crap for tanking.<br />
<br />
PS: there is no upgrade to the Wall of Terror shield in Ulduar (hard modes counted)<br />
100% fail by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I have discovered it on armory yesterday when i tried to check drop chance of pieces-and posted info about stats here on forum<br />
<br />
Yes lvl 254 probably would be too big for legendary compared to other items from ulduar but lvl 239 is too low<br />
Ideal would be 244-245 like warglaives compared to other drops from Illidian<br />
<br />
About proc chance and quality of that effect<br />
1) It works only with healing(not overhealing) so quite bad <br />
2) Question iis: how does this blessing of anciend kings works.I think it is like sacred shield so - it shields only one target<br />
If it works that way you can get only like 3k shield for 15 sec compared to sacred shield that can absorb like 7-8k in that time<br />
3) next problem how high is proc chance and if there is internal cd for that effect</div></div><hr />

<br />
'Your healing spells have a chance to cause Blessing of the Ancient Kings for 15 seconds, allowing your heals to sheild the target for 15% of the damage healed'<br />
<br />
Basically, it doesn't give the tank the shield.....but it gives you a buff. That allows you to shield *everybody* affected by the healing, by 15% of the healing done by said heal. So if you do a, say, prayer of healing, for 10k each, the entire raid gets a shield of 1.5k.<br />
<br />
Not only does this mace give the tank a shield, it gives the ability for you to heal any person (AoE included), and give it a shield.<br />

Where did you learn the Algalon drops nothing for tanks...?<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if Algalon is the Malygos of Tier 8 (dropping the ultimate armor pieces to go with everyone's 4/5 Tier 8.5). The boss that Legplates of the Endless Void drop from still hasn't been discovered.<br />
<br />
About the Legendary: Unless the proc is extremely high then I'm unimpressed. To me, Legendary means 'will not be replace before the next expansion'. Thunderfury was still being used to tank Magtheridon after being picked up all the way back in Molten Core. Sulfuras and the Warglaives I'm not sure on but I expect Hunters were still using the bow for a while into Naxx. The way this mace looks now... I wouldn't be surprised if a better item drops from the Lich King; if one does, this isn't Legendary to me.</div></div><hr />

Dont get me wrong, i dont think this mace is uber l33t wtf the best - for pala that is so but only for them. Rest of healers can get equal EPICS cuz of lack of mana reg on this mace which is sad.<br />
Im disapointed that the gap scale between epics and this legendary is way to little.<br />

There wasn't a tanking item for death knight tanks from the Malygos quests either, unless the death knight tank was prepared to sit there and accept the shame that comes with shield block rating.<br />
<br />
That said I am surprised that there isn't an item with some defense rating as a reward from that quest. They don't hate tanks, they just decided to give casters a little love for once.</div></div><hr />

50% of tanks carry shields now. I actually thought they'd got round to adding a tanking ring 'of the Kirin Tor' but turns out they haven't.<br />

I haven't noticed any bosses that tend to drop tanking items actually. Not yet at least.<br />

How about the leggings of sovereignity that drop off malygos 25 ? Those aren't made for tanking then ? The necklace makes your second reward and tbh the expertise + haste on use trinket is pretty awesome for tanks. And there surely is an upgrade to the wall of terror shield in ulduar. It's not huge and it's the same ilevel but i'd say the stats are way better on &quot;Northern Barrier&quot; that drops at hodir normal mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It'll depend on the proc rate. <br />
The weapon takes incoming heals from that healer, and makes a bubble of 15% of that. Now, at least 50% of that healing was overheal anyway, possibly as much as 80% for a paladin spamming heals on a tank non-stop. This means that, potentially, it could double that healer's healing efficiency on tanks, if the proc is up all the time. <br />
<br />
If, however, it's only up for 10% of the time, that'll be pretty useless, as it's a 15 seconds window every time it procs, you could go whole fights and never see it proc once.</div></div><hr />

I don’t think many Balance druids were stacking spirit for its benefit to Innervate. Crit is almost as good as spirit for regen, and when you consider its non-regen benefits, you probably will want it over spirit every chance you can get. Longer term we might look at something like Lunar Guidance or Dreamstate tying into spirit instead of int. However as I said (was it above or in another thread?) we need to make sure we’re happy with the way spirit works overall before we monkey around with it too much.

They already nuked down the mace when it got leaked, probably a mistake or was still in development. Just look at the screenshot on the rings; not only is there NO diversity in the itemization or class intention, but they look extremely shoddy (I mean come on, look at the &quot;Increases mana regen by 17&quot;)... Just let it go, it's not like these are the first item &quot;fakes&quot; or misposts that have ever happened, no matter how good or bad.<br />
<br />
Plus, stats on legendaries are completely besides the point. Do any of you even know what Thunderfury is? Look at it's stats (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=19019). Just calm the fuck down until you actually have one in your god damn hands and see how &quot;bad&quot; you really think it is, which 99% of you never will anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheRabidDeer</div><div class="date">2009-04-25, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the bigger issue here isn't all the know-nothings griping about the stats on the legendary, but rather the fact that these probably aren't (or CAN'T be) final, at all. They already nuked down the mace when it got leaked, probably a mistake or was still in development. Just look at the screenshot on the rings; not only is there NO diversity in the itemization or class intention, but they look extremely shoddy (I mean come on, look at the &quot;Increases mana regen by 17&quot;)... Just let it go, it's not like these are the first item &quot;fakes&quot; or misposts that have ever happened, no matter how good or bad.<br />
<br />
Plus, stats on legendaries are completely besides the point. Do any of you even know what Thunderfury is? Look at it's stats (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=19019). Just calm the fuck down until you actually have one in your god damn hands and see how &quot;bad&quot; you really think it is, which 99% of you never will anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
The first page is displaying the Euro side at the moment, which if you remember, never had many DKs in the first place. gg.<br />
<br />
While you are right in that legendary weapons are usually largely about the proc... they are also still usually above and beyond the current tier.<br />
Citing your own example of thunderfury:<br />
TF: http://www.wowhead.com/?item=19019 (53.9DPS) <br />
Quel'Serrar: http://www.wowhead.com/?item=18348 (52.5DPS)<br />
<br />
Warglaive (MH): http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32837 (109.3DPS)<br />
Blade of Infamy: http://www.wowhead.com/?item=30881 (100.2DPS)<br />
Even in sunwell, Muramasa: http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34214#comments (107.9DPS).<br />
The proc was godly for all classes too, it basically provided a bloodlust for 10 seconds every 45 seconds too.<br />
<br />
In all cases, the proc was great, but in addition to the proc the weapons have been above and beyond in terms of stats AND item level too (valanyr is equivalent to the current tier, rather than above it).<br />
<br />
I dont know the mechanics behind the legendary proc, but unless it provides some kind of stacking to work with a druids HoT spells, it will be largely wasted since our biggest HoT tick is about 2.2 or 2.3k (300 dmg shield yay).</div></div><hr />

Interesting to look at the sk gaming top 100 now, 2v2 is almost entirely Rogue-Priest setups to an even higher proportion than the DK-Pala setups used to dominate there. Considering that DK and Pala are also far more popular classes as a percentage of the population I guess that means balance has swung way too far in the other direction.</div></div><hr />

Yep , Shaman got nau Bubble like palys and can escape of Rogue and mage , if rogue gor you , 98% chanse that you lose in 2 sec.<br />
<br />
Rogue can Stun you in that 10 sec burst dmg 6 times , and mage also silenc for 2-4 sec. No gcd on Stuns</div></div><hr />

Those aren't made for tanking then ? The necklace makes your second reward and tbh the expertise + haste on use trinket is pretty awesome for tanks. And there surely is an upgrade to the wall of terror shield in ulduar. It's not huge and it's the same ilevel but i'd say the stats are way better on &quot;Northern Barrier&quot; that drops at hodir normal mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
that shield is crap.<br />
Wall of Terror has the best balance / itemization for what a tank needs.<br />
It has everything that a tank wants, and no, there is no upgrade for it in Ulduar.</div></div><hr />

Blizz is starting to fail really hard and shows no love for the tanks.<br />
I'm not asking for a legendary. All I wanted is tanks get a shot at the Algalon quest.<br />
Since tanks won't get any reward from the Algalon quest, it means we will never see the awesome chain and the big &quot;finale&quot; when you finish the quest in Dalaran.<br />
<br />
Thanks Blizz for taking away our epic moments.</div></div><hr />

You will still be able to do the quest. You just won't get loot for your main spec.</div></div><hr />

you know that the archivum disk drops only for 1 person in a week. just like the Maly neck quest.<br />
and why would I take the archivum disk from the other 23 people in the raid ?<br />

no reward, no reason.</div></div><hr />

This is probably the worst piss-and-moan comment I've read in a long time. EVERYONE gets to see the finale, Algalon isn't willy-nilly, the quest item, much like Maly, is the key to actually fighting the boss, not just a SINGLE piece of loot. Downing Algalon is a group/guild accomplishment, as of right now, seeing how no one's done it and it's only an hour per reset. The mentality you're demonstrating isn't going to get you anywhere in serious raiding.</div></div><hr />

But GC hails the usefulness of the proc like it's the new messiah for healers - we'll see.<br />

Exactly what I thought.. imo it needs a buff! ;DThe shield proc is better than nothing.. but its still not that AMAZING to be on a legendary wep.. :-\</div></div><hr />

2 dps and 2 caster rewards from Algalon ?<br />

me, as a tank, it makes me not even try to kill Algalon, knowing that I will get NOTHING!<br />
we did the hard mode Council, but it seems like there is no point for me getting the quest item.<br />
Thank you Blizz. you screwed us up again.<br />
<br />
<br />
It makes you not even want to try Algalon? It also makes you selfish for thinking only of yourself and none of the other 24 people in your raid. If you're not the gm of you guild, you deserved to be kicked for thinking like that.</div></div><hr />
