New Character Models: Worgen and Goblins<br />
First introduced in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, worgen and goblins are getting some long-anticipated improvements to their character models. These updates touch on every aspect of how the worgen and goblins look—from their faces to their animations.<br />
<br />
WoW 15th Anniversary Event<br />
This November is the 15th anniversary of World of Warcraft, and we have some special things planned to commemorate the occasion.<br />
<br />
Anniversary Gift<br />
Players who log in during the event period will receive an Anniversary Gift in the mail, which includes a Lil’ Nefarian battle pet, a Celebration Package that increases experience and reputation gains throughout the event, a reusable firework that can be used for the duration of the event, an item that teleports you to the Caverns of Time (usable only during the event), and other in-game goodies.<br />
<br />
New Raids: Memories of Azeroth<br />
Chromie has separated the strands of time, allowing you to go back and relive epic raid encounters from Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, and Cataclysm. Each of these limited-time raids will feature three iconic bosses, and they’ll be available as their own wings through the Raid Finder.<br />
<br />
To enter the raid, you need a minimum item level of 380. Players who complete all three wings will receive the achievement Memories of Fel, Frost and Fire which grants the Obsidian Worldbreaker, a Black Dragonflight mount inspired by Deathwing.<br />
<br />
Return to Alterac Valley of Olde<br />
Run down your enemies, raze their fortifications, and exchange the tokens you loot from their corpses to summon mighty reinforcements in Korrak’s Revenge, a throwback Battleground inspired by the earliest days of Alterac Valley.<br />
<br />
Players who participate in Korrak’s Revenge and complete the Alterac Valley of Olde achievement can earn two new mounts: the Stormpike Battle Ram (Alliance) and the Frostwolf Snarler (Horde).<br />
<br />
New Quests<br />
Many new stories and adventures are now available across Azeroth.<br />
<br />
The War Campaign Concludes<br />
Tensions continue to rise between Saurfang, Anduin, and the Banshee Queen Sylvanas. Discover the fate of the Horde and Alliance in the final chapter of the War Campaign.<br />
<br />
Magni Bronzebeard<br />
With N'Zoth's imminent emergence, you must seek help from an unlikely ally: the Black Prince, Wrathion. Level 120 players should seek out Magni in the Chamber of Heart to continue the story and discover the Black Dragonflight’s whereabouts.<br />
<br />
Making it Easier to Party Up with Friends<br />
<br />
Introducing Party Sync<br />
Party Sync is a new feature that makes it easier than ever for friends to party up and quest together. When players activate Party Sync, everyone in the party becomes aligned to the same quest state and phase. By mousing over a quest in your tracker, you can see who’s on a given quest, what their progress is, and who’s ready to turn it in. You’ll also have access to a “replay quest” feature that allows players who have already completed certain quests to replay those quests with their friends for rewards that are appropriate to their current level, regardless of the original level of the quest. Quests can be replayed for rewards once a day.<br />
<br />
Relaxing Level Restrictions<br />
We’ve also relaxed level restrictions, so lower-level players can queue for instanced content (such as Battlegrounds and dungeons) in their level range, and higher-level players can choose to join them by having their level scaled down. Please note that unlike Timewalking, when your level is scaled, you will temporarily lose access to abilities and powers (such as Azerite Traits and over-level spell, abilities, talents, and trinkets’ effects) with requirements that exceed your reduced level.<br />
<br />
Recruit A Friend Returns<br />
Ready to bring your friends to Azeroth and show them the ropes? Doing so is easier than ever with our revamped Recruit A Friend system! If you have active game time, you’ll be able to recruit up to 10 friends—both veterans who haven’t been subscribed for over two years and newcomers—to share in your adventures. Enjoy 50% bonus experience for faster leveling when you and your recruit are partied together and summon each other once every 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
The new Recruit A Friend lets you generate a custom link that you can send to your friends. This link will help you connect with each other, and you’ll be able to see if they have purchased game time, which will lead to rewards for you! For each month your recruits have active game time, you’ll earn a new reward, such as unique pets, mounts, game time, and more. These rewards unlock each month and scale with the amount of time your recruits have subscribed for. And, of course, with Party Sync you’ll be able to journey with your friends on any of your characters.<br />
<br />
New Mount: Honeyback Harvester<br />
Stormsong’s Beekeepers have discovered a new hive in town. Alliance players can work with Barry to locate the hive and court the favor of the Hivemother in order to earn the Honeyback Harvester mount—and both factions can earn several other bee-themed toys and items.<br />
<br />
New Timewalking Raid: Firelands<br />
While Cataclysm Timewalking is active, max-level players will be able to form a raid group and enter the Sulfuron Spire raid. As with previous Timewalking raids (Black Temple and Ulduar), your gear and power are scaled to the challenge, and all the bosses and rewards you expect lie in wait.<br />
<br />
Note that mounts do not benefit from mount equipment in battlegrounds or Arenas and that some do not benefit from mount equipment at all such as the Sky Golem.<br />
<br />
Holiday Updates<br />
Lunar Festival<br />
Embark on an adventure around Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms to complete the Rite of the Moon and help an old druid bless her Staff of Moonflowers. In return, she will enchant your flower crowns so they never die, and you can transmogrify them year-round!<br />

I don't know but since the only removed enchant illusion are the PvP ones (Ragnaros' flames can still be obtained during the Winter Veil event) I think they might have opened the pandora's box and added old elite PvP mogs. Or maybe they simply added the Nightmare / Timewarp from Legion into this since they seems to have a mountlike droprate.</div></div><hr />

Good point. They also may have added trash drops and unique boss drop loot from Naxx 40. Figured that was inevitable with the way they've screwed over old school raiders already.</div></div><hr />

It's locked to the Alliance entirely. As of the PTR. And I personally think that's awesome, being a Horde player myself. They got just a ton of horses of different colors for rep mounts at the start of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

This penalizes the higher level player because hes stuck only being able to que for dungeons that is low lvl, and in wich he will already have compelted the quests in. <br />
The result of this is that the higher level player will have to sacrifice alot of exp/hour to play with his lower level friend. Wich means that it will happen alot less. <br />

How does it “penalise” a higher level character when it’s out of choice. It basically means that if you’re levelling with a friends, or a RAF friend (which is probably why they’ve done it), then you can queue with them and join them. It doesn’t mean that higher level characters are being forced into lower range queues.</div></div><hr />

Did you stop after 6words into my post? Because i litterarly described how it penalizes the higher player right away. <br />
<br />
But dont worry ill repeat it for you: Doing a dungeon youve already done is considerably less exp than doing a new one. So teaming up with a 20lvl lower player means lower exp because you will only be able to get into the instances at that lower players levelrange. Thats the penalization.</div></div><hr />

Do you really not understand the concept? If you have a friend who is new to the game, and is dozens of levels below you, you can easily queue with them for a dungeon or a battleground and your level will be scaled down so you're not one-shotting everything. This is not something you'd do in order to get experience for yourself. It's so you can play alongside your friend on a level playing field. I wouldn't put any more thought into this, it clearly sounds like something you're not interested in.</div></div><hr />

If you have been doing your Periodic Destruction achievement progress every week today is the first week you can complete it, which means it is the first day you can also complete the Undersea Usurper meta achievement and finally receive your Snapback Scuttler crab mount<br />
<br />
This is entirely incorrect, it was achievable last week 9/17/19 as that's when I completed Periodic Destruction. The first time you do the quest it gives you one of the mobs automatically to teach you the process, but you can still do a 2nd time before it locks you out. Meaning week 1 allowed 2 bosses towards the achievement, not one. And yes I did it every week since Nazjatar was patched in.</div></div><hr />
