Model changes in 2.3<br />
I never posted about it because there aren't many of them, but a few models have been changed in 2.3. A few armors have been recolored to match item sets, and two weapons have been changed. First, the [item=32369] now looks like Mother Shahraz weapons. Now, the big nerf, one of the most used weapons have been changed ... the [item=3335] has been reverted to its old skin ! Sorry. <br />

Ok the selling enchants on AH will be nice at WotLK, but stuff like primal might in elementals section.. Im still just gonna write in primal might and search to put it like that :P</div></div><hr />

A favourites feature would be nice on the AH too, to save typing in what you're looking for each time.</div></div><hr />

This line is wrong since you can never put Nether Vortex on AH, ;D Its BoP.</div></div><hr />

In Item Enhancement should be Armor Kits like Nethercleft Leg Armor (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=29536)</div></div><hr />

I think the sword model change is the first time ever Blizzard has changed a model into an uglier one (although the older Drillborer Disk was pretty awesome).</div></div><hr />

nice about the AH though. looking forward to those changes.</div></div><hr />

QFT. I like the new one better. The old one isn't very impressive at all, and the new one looks a bit more... savage, as is befitting the name.</div></div><hr />

/agree, the old version looks more like a caster weapon if anything. Seriously does not look like something one would slice 'n dice other people with in battle.<br />
Only the new color could have used a mild adjustment.. grey instead of brown perhaps?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Last time I checked scroll buffs did not stack with any other buffs, so the armor scrolls are useless if you have a paladin aura, the str and agi scrolls likewise if you are using flask or elixir buffs. Int and stamina scrolls similarly are made redundant by mage and priest buffs. In short, scrolls are a waste of time in a 25 man raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

As ugly as the old winged Lightforge Helm was, the updated McPaladin hat was worse. Much.</div></div><hr />
