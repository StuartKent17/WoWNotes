Argus Content<br />
This week's Argus chapter ends shortly after you see Illidan in the Veiled Den and then head back to the ship. Be sure to pick up The Wranglers (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/48460-the-wranglers) and start on the Order Hall portion of the content that unlocked this week. Several steps require completion of Order Hall missions. <br />

Titanforge Rate for Weekly Cache Increased<br />
People are getting far more titanforges from their weekly chest than before (my alts got 945s, 950s from their '935' cache). <br />
This is an intended change to the Weekly Cache, and not a bug. Wishing you all luck with your loots!<br />

Broken Shore Scenario Before Argus<br />
Seems this is actually a bit more complicated than I/we thought - it is intended that alt characters can skip the Broken Shore scenario, as long as another character on your account has completed it. <br />
<br />
So... what people may be seeing in regards to having to complete the scenario likely means they haven't completed it on at least one character. To make sure this activates for your alts, you will need to have logged into your main character, or one that has complete the Broken Shore scenario, after the launch of 7.3. <br />
<br />
Once you've logged in with a character who has completed the scenario, you will be able to speak with Khadgar at Krasus' Landing and accept the &quot;Assault on the Broken Shore&quot; quest. <br />
<br />
Khadgar should have an option to skip the scenario when you next speak with him, then you will need to turn in the quest and finally return to Dalaran (via Hearthstone or otherwise) to receive your Argus introduction quest.<br />
<br />
It's technically locked behind Broken Shore, but is able to be skipped on every character after the first. A bit of a communication issue this morning, but from my current understanding this is the intended functionality.<br />
<br />
Khadgar at Krasus' Landing in Dalaran should offer you a quest for the Broken Shore when you hit 110, if you didn't receive it automatically.

The vile and retarded wind chime gets a dose of all the prophecy garbage and Illidan rejects becoming another lame ass plot device as carrigan. Chapeau! Well done Blizzard, Illidan's true redemption is a hand, by not becoming the main character of the warcraft series. I like that; really! All I need now is a conversation between Illidan and Kadghar (rejecting becoming the guardian) about their similar circumstances and we can end this expansion in satisfaction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it's nothing to do with that, it's a fix to a long standing problem with the system for getting gear in the weekly chest, until now blizzard has 'forced' the items to titanforge up so you get the baseline ilvl reward for that M+ bracket, yet when titanforging normally, the item still uses the base ilvl of the item to measure against, lets say for example you did a +10 for the weekly, the end of dungeon ilvl reward was 890, yet in the chest for the weekly reward it is 935, but lets say the item you get in the weekly chest already titanforged up 'normally' from 890 baseline to 920, prior to this patch the game hides that and would bump up the ilvl so it met with the weekly reward criteria so you wouldn't ever see that in the item value, now what they are doing is using the items current ilvl as a baseline so you get the 'correct' ilvl reward from the weekly cache.</div></div><hr />

She will help us in the form of the Netherlight Crucible. Otherwise she would be commanding us behind the scenes, judging by how she tried to force Illidan's conversion. Personally, I love how the events turned out.</div></div><hr />

Well to be honest, she should have expected Illidan to act this way. He's not some cute puppy of the light. Nobody would expect the Punisher suddenly become the Batman type of a guy (who does not carry guns and does not kill criminals). Illidan is more of a Luciferan type - he will be defiant, no matter what. And she clearly went too far with her &quot;prophecy must be fulfilled&quot; mindrape thing.</div></div><hr />

Well... Xe'ra didnt really say he would change his personality. He just say he would fix him and give him more power. <br />
<br />
Illidan isnt some fancy word - he is teenager with anger managment issues. He should be treated as such. Instead, for some moronic reason, everyone is listening to what this demon has to say.</div></div><hr />

It's actually a nice showing of individualism vs conformity. The Light and The Legion are both representations of flavors of conformity, Illidan subscribes to the belief that you are you (&quot;I AM MY SCARS!&quot;) and that you shape your own destiny as an individual.<br />
<br />
That said, much like any god-like entity, that scene proved that The Light can be just as much of an asshole as The Legion is.<br />

I'd like to see some addendum that Xe'ra was influenced by the Legion or went rogue, or something, because if this is truly their development for the Naru and light, that's stupid. I don't agree with the not-so-subtle messaging that even those who consistently act good and virtuous actually have an ulterior agenda and are at base morally equivalent to the bad guys (Legion). Except arguably the Legion is less evil, at least in the case of Illidain, they offered him their power and he chose to accept it whereas this 'embodiment of light and virtue,' Xe'ra, attempted to FORCE it on Illidain. Very poorly written if that's the best Blizzard can come up with for the good guys. If their ultimate goal is to suggest some stupid idea like 'there is no good or evil, just different shades of gray' or whatever, that's a pretty shitty story. I love the game, the art style, plenty of the story developments, but this one is pretty freaking stupid unless their is additional context we don't yet have. <br />

A resolution to this which would restore my faith would have some explanation of why a creature which is supposed to be good and virtuous would do something so obviously wrong that a 2-year-old could explain it to you.</div></div><hr />

You mean other than everything else he's sacrificed to get to this point including his life at one point? Or you know when he will sacrifice himself (or at least his freedom) at the end of this expansion to save everyone else and make sure the Legion stays down?<br />
<br />
Illidan has his flaws, but everyone gives him too much crap. He's not perfect, and if he was, you'd hate him for that. He just made kick ass character growth here. Illidan of the past would have done anything for more power. Just as he noted. Now he knows it's not just power alone. It's not his chosen destiny. There's no chosen ones. There's just us against the legion.<br />

He sacrificed everything for more power. He was and still is power hungry megalomaniac. Also, as far as wow biology is concerned, a full blown demon. <br />
<br />
And to be honest he only screw with us so far. Pulling argus, destroying Xe'ra. He do what HE thinks is best for HIS plans. Without consulting. Even insulting beings like Velen. Who are far more powerfull and wiser than him. <br />
<br />
He didnt growth. He didnt develop. He is the same Illidan he was.</div></div><hr />
