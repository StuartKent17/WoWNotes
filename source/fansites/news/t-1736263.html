Blackrock Foundry Item Level Change<br />
We are preparing to deploy a hotfix next week that will increase the item level of all raid drops from all difficulties of the Blackrock Foundry raid.<br />
<br />
The main purpose of this change is to ensure that killing new bosses in the Blackrock Foundry raid feels appropriately rewarding. We are finding that groups coming out of a couple of months in Highmaul could often have an average item level that was just barely shy of the loot dropped by the appropriate difficulty in Foundry. A core part of the experience of progressing through a new raid tier lies in the sense that even if you didn't manage to kill a particular boss this week, the upgrades your raid group gathered along the way will make things smoother and improve your chances the following week.<br />
<br />
This change will be retroactive, affecting existing items that players may have in their possession. Thus, instead of an item level range of 650/665/680/695 for Raid Finder/Normal/Heroic/Mythic Foundry, the loot awarded will now be item level 655/670/685/700 respectively. At the same time, we will be increasing the item level of the new highest-tier crafted and Apexis vendor items by 5, in order to keep their power unchanged relative to the Foundry raid itemization.<br />
<br />
A few comments in response to some posts so far.<br />
<br />
First, I wouldn't read much into the use of the word &quot;tier&quot; in the post - it's being used as a synonym for &quot;zone&quot; in this case. The point stands regardless: When you go through a series of learning attempts and wipes to defeat a new boss for the first time, you expect a commensurate reward for doing so. Many players coming out of 2 months in Highmaul were in a situation of having to work to learn and defeat new bosses that dropped loot of roughly the same quality as what they already were wearing. That isn't satisfying and doesn't allow for much power progression.<br />
<br />
Second, the primary point of this change is not to nerf Foundry encounters. If that were the goal, it would have been much simpler to simply nerf the encounters, and we'd taken a more surgical approach to specific encounters. The aim is strictly to improve the reward side of the difficulty:reward ratio.<br />
<br />
To use an example, consider a guild that primarily does Normal mode content and eventually progresses into Heroic. This guild may have been 6/7N Highmaul by early January; they ventured into Heroic and killed 2-3 bosses there, and then went back and finished off Mar'gok on Normal. Along the way, they also got some item level 670 loot from garrison mission caches. Now, Foundry comes out. Just because this group killed a couple of Heroic Highmaul bosses after two months in the zone doesn't suddenly make them a Heroic guild - they will, appropriately, begin in Normal Foundry. But their average item level with mostly 655 items (some 661 warforged), and some 670 items from Heroic Highmaul, is likely around 661 or 662 as a raid group. And that simply doesn't leave much room for meaningful reward. And replacing a 670 non-set piece with a 665 set piece is likely a power upgrade, but also does not feel particularly satisfying. You can change the difficulties in the example above, and we see the exact same situation with Heroic guilds coming into Heroic Foundry with an average item level in the 675+ range, which again didn't leave much room for improvement.<br />
<br />
(Note that this logic really does not apply to Mythic Foundry, but once we're buffing loot from the other difficulties, we must also adjust Mythic in order to keep Mythic drops feeling like an appropriate upgrade over Heroic. Mythic Foundry is still plenty challenging and ranks among the overall hardest raid zones we've designed - an extra few item levels is not going to change that.)<br />
<br />
Edit: And yes, the actual stats on the items are of course increasing along with the item level. The point is to improve the actual reward, not smoke and mirrors creating the illusion of one.</div></div><hr />

If you think 5ilvls will boost a normal guild into mythic, you sir, are daft. <br />

Dude just quit with your wanna be elitist talk. It doesn't make you look cool. Just because the bump items up a few item levels doesn't mean mythic is going to get flooded. In case you did not read everything, bosses are not getting nerfed . So no reason to try to stroke your own ego. <br />
<br />
And I hate to tell you casuals are the main reason this game is still going now. I used to play in hardcore guilds and my main was created in 06 with almost 500 days total /played on that toon alone. well time change, but that doesn't mean your better than me now because I can't commit 5 plus nights raiding. I'm fine playing casual and raiding 2 nights a week. We are still hitting heroics and mythics.</div></div><hr />

I disagree on scrapping the warforged gear, but they shouldn't have it on mythic at all... The idea of when I down a mythic boss and thinking &quot;meh its not wf&quot; is kinda discouraging, mythic loot should be the be all end all for the tier of raiding and not ruined by a chance of warforged.</div></div><hr />

Because it's better to reward than punish, which is what nerfing gear people already have would be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends which way you look at it, I feel punished given the increase item level, and a lot of my guild think its BS, I have a feeling a lot of people that actually want to progress will feel the same, now you have to kill the bosses knowing you did it post-nerf. 5 ilvls is a BIG deal. What you mean is theres &quot;more&quot; people who see a reward in this, then there is a &quot;punishment&quot;. I havent saw the argument that Blizzard caters for casuals, but this is turning my head.</div></div><hr />

Playing in a friend&amp;family guild with a lot of below average players we hardly managed 6/7 HM (doing usually 5/7 on farm day now). <br />
8/10 NM but when loot drop more than half go to disenchant because of the ilvl being too low. At least now we can have sidegrades. (and no, we don't belong to BF HM yet, we tried it and got destroyed).<br />

I am sorry to say this.. But it's not the iLvl that keeps you from progressing ;) The mechanics are still not skippable with 5 more ilvls, but atleast blizzard is trying to convince your delusional mind, the opposite ;)</div></div><hr />

Post nerf? You know that collecting gear week to week accomplishes the same thing as this ilvl increase, right? You're killing bosses with way higher ilvl than the top guilds did.<br />

You're doing the fights &quot;post nerf&quot;, regardless of this change.</div></div><hr />

Am curious what happens to the Sets on Raid Fynder. Will they remain 655 or become 660?<br />

<br />
<br />
OT: This is going to gimp PvPers in the World again. Nothing you can do in your 690 vs people with 700 gear each of which has a chance on bonus Socket/Leech/bonus ilvl.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm aware, are tertiary stats and sockets not disabled in pvp? The proc from the legendary ring is disabled too, as otherwise like you say, pvpers would be totally destroyed by PvE players.<br />

Now I have no reason to visit HM to try and get 5ilvl upgrades, since its all in BRF now.</div></div><hr />

If it's all about clearing it with a slightly lower ilvl to prove how hard you are (note: nobody cares about your guild's progression but your guild), have everyone equip a few pieces of HM gear to drop your ilvl by 5 points. Or do it pantsless.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. Killing the heroic/mythic bosses you have on farm and still having a chance at an upgrade is one of the few joys left for those nights. It is one of the best ideas they've had.

Personally, I'd feel it would be best if there was only Warforged and Warforged + Socket, or (better yet, bring back proper sockets and just Warforged). The other stats are completely pointless, and don't really help you at all in any meaningful way, you need to stack it in order to have it be useful and you've got no chance in hell of being able to do that and right now the ONLY upgrade you want an item to come up as is Warforged + Socket, an item rolling Avoidance is not helpful.</div></div><hr />

See, thats supposed to happen to some extent since THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE SAME TIER.<br />
<br />
This change is just reinforcing the idea that this is a new tier. If BRF and HM were the same tier, this change wouldn't be needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because you are supposed to go from Mythic to Mythic, as Blizzard has stated several times before...<br />
<br />
Funny enough, they are now going on to say: but if you do not go the route we thought would be a healthy progression path (normal to normal, heroic to heroic, mythic to mythic), we will still reward you because we feel like you need it! <br />
<br />
Item-levels have been the sole difference between raid tiers, arteficially pumping BRF up now is just a poor way of masking the missing raid tier in the long run of WoD.<br />
People were doing BRF already, there was absolutely no reason to increase the reward, as they say in their blue post, since people went into BRF on their own.</div></div><hr />

HM was too long to be a 'compliment' to BRF. If that's what Blizz was aiming for they should have made HM 5 bosses or less and opened BRF much earlier. BRF is harder, longer, drops set pieces, and is 'Chapter 2' of the legendary. Making the rewards only marginally better than HM but ramping up the difficulty hasn't kept HM relevant it just made BRF feel less rewarding than it should be. <br />
<br />
My group went 8/10 Normal after going 6/7 Heroic HM and nearly everything was d/ed or offspec. We could have used the practice but nobody wanted to keep spending two raid nights progressing on content that basically dropped nothing in our eyes. So we jumped to Heroic and its been a painful slog to 6/10. Even on Heroic a lot of non-tier bosses are completely worthless due to Crafted Gear/ Mythic HM Caches. I'm at the point where I only use 2 bonus rolls a week bc we haven't been able to down a third boss that has a legit upgrade. And the thing is without upgrades there's a double hit to our motivation bc we know not only do those early bosses drop crap loot but it'll take just as much effort next week bc we aren't getting stronger.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't really matter, due to the stat squish the first 600 or so of those don't really count. Compare the raw stats of SMV/Frostfire gear to the raw stats of mythic Foundry gear. The stats more than double despite the ilvl difference being much smaller than that.<br />

<br />
Assume the same ITEM. 5ilvl is a 5% power increase on that item.<br />
If an item has 100 INT it will have 105 INT after the 5ilvl upgrade.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with the ilvl number. Everything post player level 90 (since pre 90 its linear) it becomes an exponential scale of 1.15^(ilvldifference/15)</div></div><hr />

This was my thought. This content has been done for a while - and they also had BRF on the PTR for what, 7 weeks? They should have been able to see the stat disparities way ahead of time, the reasons for doing this should have never been released. This isn't a blanket nerf to account for class tweaks, this is just sheer fucking laziness on their part. What is the point of the beta and the PTR if they spend all of their time adjusting live content via hot fixes? Maybe it's just me, but I don't recall the constant flood of hot fixes that roll out daily now, in past expansions.<br />
<br />
This is supposedly a team that has been designing this game for over a decade now, but every week, it feels more and more like a bunch of interns who were left the keys to the office while the main guys are on sabbatical. It's changes like this that make me wonder what the hell they were doing for over a year in SoO, and the 4 months since they released this game. They act like stuff just showed up in the game by accident, when this stuff was deliberately planned by them - and probably months ago. It's like they have no internal review process for the game, stuff just gets added at random, and then they spend all their time hotfixing it. 'Okay, who changed the gear levels in BFR, c'mon, guys. Fess up.&quot; <br />
<br />
More ilvl is good, don't get me wrong - yay better stats. But seriously, this should have never been an issue. I've never seen a change like this, it's amazing to me they even had the need to do it. This is raid content, their premiere content, that they spend a big chunk of their dev budget on. Nobody sat down and looked at the gear levels before now? What the hell do they do all day in Irvine? What the hell were they doing for 14 months, during the Great Content Drought of 2014?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracodraco</div><div class="date">2015-03-15, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For all of you people going on about &quot;5 item levels = 5% dps&quot;, it's really not. There's way too many factors (weapon dps scaling, secondary scaling and interaction) in play here.<br />
As an example, a sim of me using the standard BM-setup in full mythic gear with the 710 legendary ring gives me 46614 DPS. Now, as WF is 6 ilvls higher than non WF, we'd assume you'd get a 6% upgrade using full WF, right? Well, the actual number for sim with the WF affix on everything is 49325 - or a 5.8% increase.<br />
<br />
BM doesn't even scale exceptionally well, though - do the same experiment with MM, which scales absolutely ridicolously with weapon damage, and we get:<br />
48709 with full warforged.<br />
45900 non WF. <br />
Or a 106.1% increase (worth 2809 dps). <br />
HOWEVER, of that 6.1%, the difference the weapon alone makes is immense - adding just the WF weapon bumps the damage to 46631, or a 1.6% increase.<br />
<br />
So essentially, while 5 more item levels will (closely) resemble a 5% dps upgrade, well-scaling specs will get slightly more, and others with bad scaling will get slightly less. Likewise, the biggest contributers to DPS is Trinkets and Weapons on almost every DPS spec. Using MM as an example again, letting JUST the 2x trinkets and weapon be WF and all other 12 pieces be normal, they (combined) get us to 47108, or 1601 of the 2809 DPS that the 6 item levels of all mythic WF items gives us - more than HALF of the gain sits in just three of your fifteen (or sixteen) items. <br />
<br />
TL;DR -<br />
5 Ilvls isn't exactly 5% due to scaling, half of your dmg increase will probably come from just trinkets+weapons alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue is that you shouldn't have viewed Highmaul as being &quot;older content&quot;. They wanted Highmaul to be a stepping stone into foundry, like MSV was for HoF/Terrace, but it ended up not becomming so, because all the top tier guilds completed Highmaul too fast compared to foundrys release.<br />
When Blizz then finally released foundry, all the &quot;low level&quot; raiders like yourself saw that no high end raiders ever resumed back to highmaul, and just copied their behaviour, figuring you should keep pushing foundry.<br />
<br />
In reality, a thing such as Mythic Foundry has the first part of the raid (initial ~5 bosses) tuned for an average of 679-681 item level - or a complete, full set of heroic gear+legendary ring for the average raider. Their hope was that people would do mythic highmaul after getting decked in some heroic gear, to fill in pieces with slightly stronger gear, and then turn to mythic foundry with their +680 item level. Instead, people kept bashing their head against heroic foundry to get to 680 full heroic sets, and then start mythics, which frustrated a shittone of guilds. <br />
<br />
In the end, their intentions were just fine, and this is not &quot;an issue&quot; that they could ever have discovered on beta - they simply just missed the timing on WHEN to release BRF, because it seemed like MSV-&gt;HoF was released too quickly and didn't give people enough time. In the future, I'm willing to bet that if they take this multi-raid release for a single tier again, they'll make sure that the top raiders don't get a big breathing room (most of us had more than a month to just sit back and relax after 2-3 hrs of farm was done) between the releases again, because it ended up fucking their intentions and strategy over BIGTIME. <br />
<br />
What they COULD have done, was ensure that the itemization in highmaul was actually good - this way, even with 10 ilvls less, tons of people would go there to get gear because of the far better stats. They, however, opted to give everything in highmaul extremely crappy itemisation, in fear that no one would want to run BRF because there'd be no upgrades. This is what happened with MSV (Where the BiS trinkets for every role dropped - the strength and healer trinket from Will of the Emperor, and the healer and caster trinkets from Elegon, the two last bosses of the raid instance, thus forcing full clears every week), and part of why it stayed relevant for (almost) the entire tier. I can assure you, if shit like the chewtoy, the blackhand trinkets, Meaty dragonspine trophy, blast furnace door and all that other trinket junk dropped in Highmaul, rather than the current near-useless static-trinkets and a few &quot;decent-ish&quot; proc trinkets, top guilds would still be farming the shit out of Highmaul for trinket upgrades. <br />
<br />
But all in all, it's not something that could have been easily predicted, or discovered, because it hadn't been tried before - last time was too soon, this time it was too slow. Next time, maybe it'll be &quot;just right&quot; instead.</div></div><hr />

Considering the thread in the DK forum keeps growing and they are still disgruntled, I think you may want to check up on your facts there, buddy.

Because some people cant do it, how is that a fail? I think it is great. The raid has only been out a bit over a month, if you are still progressing on Blast Furnace as a heroic guild, thats fine...because your end tier is heroic (obviously you may be able to get a few mythic kills as well). But it splits the difficulty more to allow for Mythic to actually be a bit challenging. It just frustrates me to see Blizz nerf content ALREADY (like seriously let us progress, its been 1 month, lol).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The item level and stat difference between entire raid tiers in Vanilla and TBC were hardly anything impressive, and yet people still had incentive to clear new raids when they were released.<br />
<br />
You shouldn't have to rely on an arbitrary number on a piece of gear in order to draw interest from your playerbase to enter your raids; the raids themselves will do that - even if the ilvl difference is minuscule. This is how stat inflation started all those years ago.</div></div><hr />

That said, it seems this change is pretty much aimed at guilds like mine. We raided ~1-2 nights a week during highmaul and some of these were 1-2 hour sessions. Got through normal and 5/7 heroic. Then we looked at the ilvl-table of BRF and thought &quot;hay we should probably be doing heroic&quot;. Didn't work out very well. We do ok in normal, but disenchant MANY pieces of gear, while on heroic we can only clear 3 bosses.<br />

Personally It doesnt really bother me, Its just made gearing alts that bit faster, But unless HM drops your bis stats your just going to ignore it and do BRF instead especially when LFR drops similar gear that HM Normal does</div></div><hr />

It really is that simple<br />
No, clearly not. Since ilvl is irrelevant in boss damage or healthpool.<br />
<br />
5 ilvl doesnt even increase YOUR ilvl by 5%... Math is so hard.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sime</div><div class="date">2015-03-15, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering how the new instances feel made to not allow professional (read players paid to play) being able of clearing all mythic bosses in the first day of release... BRF and HM still are too hard, considering what they have done to classes this xpac, removing all base dmg on abilities and put everything into procs... This ilvl increase is welcomed, because before the reason to actually get brf gear was only to boost your &quot;wrong&quot; stats.... <br />
Considering everything in WoD.... removing reforge and gems isnt a good idea imo... In MoP you could still increase your dps no matter what item you took, just as it was higher ilvl, you could adapt your gear... As it is now, you can have full BIS hc dungeon gear with the correct stats and do more dmg then someone in random 655 gear... which kind of is wrong imo.. For me playing 14 chars i really hate that i cant reforge and make each char push the highest possible dmg of that ilvl without having to Farm instances.<br />
RNG this xpac is by far worse then before due to this fact.<br />
<br />
People still look at ilvl to have you join premade groups.. Thus having 650+ and being able to do the encounters without dying (well gl you have the worst stats so you will be removed anyways for low dps/ilvl ratio, cause they might have just seen a player with a few more multistrike or crit items that did 5k more dps) Bring reforge back. Make that mount usefull again.<br />

<br />
I agree, just imagine how you could have fixed that yourself if you could reforge your crap 645 items.. you might be able to push 30k with the gear then. <br />
<br />
They wanted to make the game easier for new players, I basicly hate frost mages now that base frostbolt cast is 1.9 sec.... ooh you have a fast frostbolt each 10sec.... still doesnt help when you have to move.... So they make alot of procs and instants instead you have to time while moving. Fixing a problem whilst creating another.. nah bad idea overall</div></div><hr />

They should really drop the warforged idea next expansion, that's really the source of this 5 level item bloat.<br />

Yup - warforged items are causing major problems with many guilds. Players will not take minor upgrades on items with bad secondary stats but rather wait for Warforged. This causes unrest and unhappy teammates and guilds suffer extra issue that isn't needed.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see the math on that, as i don't believe it thats simple even with scaling differences to say that 5 ilvl is 5% for every spec / class / raid comp, as i think for some it might be more, for some it might be less.</div></div><hr />

Awsome, so lesson of the story is, if you hadnt gated BRF, a normal guild would have jumped between the raids and progressed the bosses in the difficulty hierarchy in the way its suppose to be done, namely start with easy bosses in both raids and then over time over come harder and harder bosses with imp and blackhand at the end. Look at cata start tier, very common to kill one or two in WbD, one in ToT4w and one or two in Bastion before starting on the next difficulty tier of bosses. Now if say, Bastion had been gated and players would have only farmed BwD no one would have given a fuck for bastion except in the case of tier and trinkets. Its simple really, gate separate tiers dont gate within the tier as the bosses being reliesed after a longer period of farm will have to in effect be a separate tier, both in terms of difficulty(more player items= more power = harder bosses) and in gear to be rewarding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
5 ilvl is 5% increase in stats. How your specific class handles with stats is class dependent, but 5% more of all stats will occur.<br />
<br />
Now say you are concerned with DPS and saying &quot;OMG 5% is not 5% because I dont scale well&quot; or whatever then look at simcraft.<br />
<br />
The formula we are using is 1.15^(ilvl/15) so a 5ilvl is a 4.768% increase. <br />
<br />
Take a simple item like:<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/item=113898/eye-catching-gilded-robe&amp;bonus=0<br />
665 ilvl<br />
231 int<br />
347 stam<br />
139 crit<br />
163 haste<br />
<br />
Now make that warforged which gives you a 5.7497% increase:<br />
671 ilvl now makes<br />
231 int -&gt; 244.28<br />
347 stam -&gt; 366.95<br />
139 crit -&gt; 146.99<br />
163 haste -&gt; 172.37<br />
<br />
Wow items always round up, so hence you give a rounded version on wowhead:<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/item=113898/eye-catching-gilded-robe&amp;bonus=560<br />
<br />
5ilvls is about a 5% increase in stats....you may not see a 5% increase in DPS due to your itemization.<br />
<br />
But if you want a simulation, look at simcraft T17H vs T17M. The worst scaling class (prot pally) goes up by 15.39% dps for 15 ilvls. The best (Fire mage) goes up by 21.19%.<br />
<br />
So while your stats go up by 5% your DPS may go up slightly more due to scaling of your particular classes secondary weights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BRF is more tightly tuned than Highmaul. The 10-ilvl bump barely registered unless itemization for your class was horrible to begin with.<br />
<br />
ilvl won't fix shitty class/item design though unfortunately. Some people with spec/class preferences are going to be left in the dust regardless.<br />

It also won't fix Premade shitters who demand ridiculous requirements and boot people other than themself on a whim that make mistakes.</div></div><hr />

Blood Legion seems to have collapsed in some capacity and also the guild Fatboss was in was 8/10 mythic and now he's on alliance. This along with the amount of guilds stuck on Furnace / Blackhand in both Heroic and Mythic this now means they'll most likely be able to push that few % to achieve the kills.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day they don't want people to burnout and lose subs, and this is the easier way rather than nerfing the encounter to give people the incentive to continue playing while they try to make patch 6.2.<br />
<br />
For me the outcome is all the same, finish chapter III next week, hopefully get a BH HC kill under my belt next week with the inflated stats on gear and then wait it out till 6.2 as not a lot of mythic guilds on my server at least and not gonna swap servers.</div></div><hr />

a 5 ilvl boost is trivial in the grand scheme of things. Sure, it is a nerf (and a VERY minor one at that) but the world first race is over, and it does do a lot to make BRF feel a lot more rewarding.<br />

<br />
The problem with this is that is assumes that the increase in power from an ilvl of 1 up to 650, or whatever ilvl you choose, is linear.... when it is anything but, especially now, after Blizzard did the stat squish. If you need proof of this, look at, say, Heroic items from Dragon Soul vs. Normal or even LFR versions of the same item... in all cases, they generally have very similar stats.... in fact, Heroic Gurthalak at ilvl 416 actually has LESS weapon damage than the LFR Gurthalak at ilvl 390, although the stats are still the same.<br />

Talking about item level percent increase is pointless in the terms of the game. I dont care if my ilvl is 100 or 10000, all that matters is how many stats do I have.<br />

You are intentionally trying to distract people and intentionally trolling by doing an ilvl percent difference vs a power difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They really should have left this line out. It doesn't inspire hope and confidence in a developer I love. This should have been pretty easy to spot when you were all sitting at a meeting and agreeing that Heroic Highmaul will have a 670 ilvl and Heroic BFR would have a 680 ilvl and that you were going to give away Mythic gear through missions to those raiders. I'm happy about the change, but I feel like this should have been caught earlier. Especially knowing it would be roughly 3 months before BRF came out following HM. The major issue with HM/BRF is they feel like two separate tiers of raiding when I think their original design was for them to be closer together and be more cohesive.</div></div><hr />

BRF is a half-tier ahead, like MSV-&gt;HoF/ToES. Thing is, they released HoF/ToES very quickly after MSV (too quickly IMO) so the gear gap was less of an issue. There was no Warforged back then either. BRF and HM are too close now.<br />
<br />
I'm not entirely sold on this half-tier business, rather than just splitting them up into actual separate tiers. But at least HM had time to breathe, unlike MSV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to AMR infrographics, the recommended minimum ilvl of a raid to kill Blackhand on NORMAL mode is 671. Wipe rate for our ilvl of 669 is 99% or 1 kill per 131 attempts. He drops 665 ilvl loot as do all the bosses before him. Sense, this does not make! <br />
<br />
Admittedly it could also be achieved by just nerfing Blackhand but currently, in terms of difficulty (ignoring mythic for the moment as I cannot comment on it) the tier seems to be as follows;<br />
HM N -&gt; HM HC -&gt; BRF N -&gt; BRF HC<br />
<br />
It would make sense then that gear ilvls match this progression or at least don't regress comparatively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz removed reforging without paying any attention whatsoever to itemization in respect to different classes/specs that share the loot table. That resulted in higher ilevel gear often being passed on by any one with half a brain cos 5 of main stat + stam is less beneficial then 100+ of a godly secondary. This fix achieves very little. 10+ main stat is still worse then 100+ of said secondary. There are some classes/specs who face a reverse situation, when it's worth dropping HM Mythic gear, for normal BRF gear (my hunter went from 676 pre BRF to 668 with BRF gear and his output jumped up by 8% pre tier bonuses). <br />
<br />
It's mind boggling how players can quite happily use community written tools to judge what's optimal for them to tackle a tightly tuned instance, yet various devs seem to have trouble with it, being the ones that come up with the system in the first place.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it seems like people responsible for individual classes do not talk to one another at all, don't play respective classes/specs nor have any communication whatsoever with the team that does the number crunching for raids. <br />
<br />
Traditional progression between two raid instances of the same tier would be normal to normal, heroic to heroic and logically, even tho we have no precedence, mythic to mythic. Gating, the way it was implemented resulted in BRF being it's own tier and requiring Heroic HM geared players to successfully clear normal BRF within the first couple of weeks. Normal geared players could at most get few kills and hope for BiS upgrades to be able to push further. <br />
<br />
Splitting the item levels within one tier further results in widening the already massive gap in dps/hps per tier as seen in MoP. <br />
<br />
Why would anyone spend time and resources on a game wide number squish when you are on a straight road to inflate the numbers beyond any reason before this expansion is over? <br />
<br />
4 difficulties, three of which have 2 different actual ilevels a pop resulting in a progression via 7 different gear stages within one tier; that's not counting beginning of the xpac dungeon gear or 2 ilevels worth of basic mission gear else we'd arrive at an astonishing 11 possible stages to the gearing up process in the first tier.<br />
<br />
I wish someone from Blizz would take the time to explain to the community what is the purpose of it all. <br />
<br />
Subs peaked when all we had was good dungeons and one level of raiding difficulty and started falling down with all the ridiculous experiments followed by frantic attempts to keep people playing, not via solid content, but gimmicky solutions that give an illusion of a lot to do. All the while, failing at rather elementary math.<br />
<br />
What we are being served lately is not 'fixes' - a fix addresses the cause of a problem and eliminates it. We're being served patches, that temporary treat the effects, while the causes are not being dealt with at all and create new problems, sooner rather then later.<br />

They actually stated that &quot;unoptimal gear&quot; was intended. If they put in items with the best combo of stats for a given class, said class will not upgrade their gear for two or more tiers of content unless it's also the best combo. This leads to gear being basically &quot;+betterer&quot;.<br />
<br />
Note that they also attempted to have the secondary stats being best for different classes/specs so that each item would appeal differently to each member of raid. But I don't think it led to the desired social results. I might be mistaken, though.<br />

To be honest, I'm still baffled about the existence of the duality of normal/heroic.<br />
<br />
In terms of intended purpose for raids, there's 3 different raid schemes: Not requiring coordination and familiarity (aka LFR), requiring coordination/familiarity (&quot;guild raiding&quot;), tightly tuned with extra mechanics (mythic).<br />
<br />
Within that hierarchy, the distinction between normal and heroic is basically one of numbers. They have the same mechanics, the same range of allowed players, the same invite systems, the same boss mechanics. Heroic just has more damage and HP. I personally think it should not exist. Of course, it leads to the strange artefact of progression that players need to begin heroic mode before they finish the normal one. Even Blizzard says it; look at their example of a guild that has &quot;7/8 normal, then went back to do some heroics, then killed Mar'gok&quot;. Put in that way, it looks pretty weird.</div></div><hr />

well guys, 97% of us better quit playing right now, were all too bad to play this game since we dont have mythic kills and only run lower difficulties, king of the neck beards huldu has spoken and issued his decree on high to us plebs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normal is/was flex, intended for pugs and guilds with bad gear or players.<br />
<br />
Heroic is/was normal, intended for guild groups to gear and progress onto heroic (now mythic).<br />
<br />
IMO the new names are the issue not the amount of tiers, they should have kept them called flex/normal/heroic and it would have been a lot easier for people to get to grips with, but as it stands you get a lot of people who don't get it, I.E I have seen some guilds moaning that their players pug normal lol.</div></div><hr />

Not that it is hard, but I would say normal of this tier is more difficult than flex was in SoO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Note that they also attempted to have the secondary stats being best for different classes/specs so that each item would appeal differently to each member of raid. But I don't think it led to the desired social results. I might be mistaken, though.<br />
<br />
They have indeed. Fair point. And it worked semi alright in HM, which was not particularly tightly tuned - my Disc priest had 10 pieces of gear with multistrike on it at one point, a virtually useless stat, it hasn't stopped me from completing Heroic and 2 fights on mythic before BRF came out without being a burdan on my team. However, BRF has much higher entry requirements and optimization became key nearly instantly once you wanted to do the heroic to heroic jump. So their initial 'unoptimal gear is intended and fine' philosophy made the raid appear harder then it actually is and for vast majority of people rather inaccessible the first 2 weeks, past 2 or 3 encounters; or forced heroic raiding guilds back to normal difficulty within one tier. <br />
<br />
They have very clearly stated 4 difficulties does not mean raiders are obliged to run all 4 to progress - they are supposedly directed at different groups of players with varied approach to raiding. Yet whether you like it or not, even if your aim is Mythic, you're back to square one, doing normals after weeks of beating the hardest content because gear optimization is so poor that you simply need various pieces/sets in order to get the numbers to tackle the encounters at the level you're interested. It's not easy recruiting raiders nowadays. The only time we've struggled more as a guild was at the end of Cataclysm. People are sick and tired of seeing the same fights over and over again before they are able to tackle the difficulty the fits them best - once. <br />
<br />
It's the inconsistency that gets me most I think. There appears to be a big 'random' element in some of the decisions with very little vision of the game as a whole for the duration of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They summed up my own thoughts on current loot perfectly. I was getting mission rewards that meant nothing. And we weren't even bothering to farm the mythic bosses we have killed so far due to how few loot upgrades they had. Drops also felt completely uninspiring, since anything you did get was 'meh' at best. In many cases you were just hoping for WF or a socket, in case your mythic HM didn't already have that. In other cases, your drop was worthless since your old gear had a socket or WF status - making it better.<br />
<br />
Good move Blizz - smart and good timing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RuneeBH</div><div class="date">2015-03-16, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I'm just so annoyed and bored and sick of having to talk about like 6-7 different difficulties, all ranging in iLvl and then combining that with warforged, it is just way too much.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">brok3nh3lix</div><div class="date">2015-03-16, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizz removed reforging without paying any attention whatsoever to itemization in respect to different classes/specs that share the loot table. That resulted in higher ilevel gear often being passed on by any one with half a brain cos 5 of main stat + stam is less beneficial then 100+ of a godly secondary. This fix achieves very little. 10+ main stat is still worse then 100+ of said secondary. There are some classes/specs who face a reverse situation, when it's worth dropping HM Mythic gear, for normal BRF gear (my hunter went from 676 pre BRF to 668 with BRF gear and his output jumped up by 8% pre tier bonuses). <br />
<br />
It's mind boggling how players can quite happily use community written tools to judge what's optimal for them to tackle a tightly tuned instance, yet various devs seem to have trouble with it, bein<br />
g the ones that come up with the system in the first place.<br />
<br />
Sometimes it seems like people responsible for individual classes do not talk to one another at all, don't play respective classes/specs nor have any communication whatsoever with the team that does the number crunching for raids. <br />
<br />
Traditional progression between two raid instances of the same tier would be normal to normal, heroic to heroic and logically, even tho we have no precedence, mythic to mythic. Gating, the way it was implemented resulted in BRF being it's own tier and requiring Heroic HM geared players to successfully clear normal BRF within the first couple of weeks. Normal geared players could at most get few kills and hope for BiS upgrades to be able to push further. <br />
<br />
Splitting the item levels within one tier further results in widening the already massive gap in dps/hps per tier as seen in MoP. <br />
<br />
Why would anyone spend time and resources on a game wide number squish when you are on a straight road to inflate the numbers beyond any reason before this expansion is over? <br />
<br />
4 difficulties, three of which have 2 different actual ilevels a pop resulting in a progression via 7 different gear stages within one tier; that's not counting beginning of the xpac dungeon gear or 2 ilevels worth of basic mission gear else we'd arrive at an astonishing 11 possible stages to the gearing up process in the first tier.<br />
<br />
I wish someone from Blizz would take the time to explain to the community what is the purpose of it all. <br />
<br />
Subs peaked when all we had was good dungeons and one level of raiding difficulty and started falling down with all the ridiculous experiments followed by frantic attempts to keep people playing, not via solid content, but gimmicky solutions that give an illusion of a lot to do. All the while, failing at rather elementary math.<br />
<br />
What we are being served lately is not 'fixes' - a fix addresses the cause of a problem and eliminates it. We're being served patches, that temporary treat the effects, while the causes are not being dealt with at all and create new problems, sooner rather then later.<br />
<br />
A little retrospection and constructive self criticism could go a long way.<br />
<br />
Subbs peaked when we had 3, technically 4, levels of raiding . 10,man, 10 man hardmode, 25 man, 25 man hard mode. <br />
<br />
<br />
You like many people try to a sign the wrong things to the fall in subs. Feature changes and game design may play a part, But the vast majority is due to one simple fact, peak Sun's was never sustainable. Wow peaked and hit critical consumer awareness during wrath. People are no longer discovering wow, people know what wow is, it's in the realm of pop culture. People were picking up wow at the time because,every one was playing. It wasn't for every one,long term. Regardless of how good the game is, people will stop playing after some amount of time. <br />
<br />
Add in increased competition from in the mmo market, competition from other genres, like the rise of mobas, the rise of free to play games, and the rise of consoles for online gaming.<br />
<br />
Blaming the bulk of the sub decline on features that the majority of wow players use, but,you don't like is short sited and fails to look at all the other, much larger market forces that this game which is over 10 Yeats old faces.<br />

Why do,you think multi strike is useless for disc? It does work on shields, (yes, Pws and cow, you just don't see it in logs.) it's actually on par with crit and some argue slightly ahead due to eaa. Mastery is generally our best stat due to Pws spam, and haste is strong to, but at the cost of mana.

It's comparatively crap despite how close the weights are. Even if there isn't much of a difference,even if it isn't a noticeable difference no one wants gear with the worst stats on them even if it's only worse by like .1 on the scale.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. It's very much like the content that was released went through no internal review, or oversight. This is getting more fascinating that the game itself - watching for the next bad move by the devs to fix a flawed design that should have never made it to live servers in the first place. <br />
<br />
This is the kind of change you do in beta, or on the PTR, so live players aren't impacted. It's fortunate that in the end, this will benefit some players, but it only showcases that there's problems in Irvine, big problems. Imagine the outcry if this change had had the reverse outcome on players and gear - it would be open revolt, and deserved. It's bothersome that there was no awareness of the issue until now, by the people that designed it - people with an enormous amount of collective experience from 10 years of designing and playing this game. Did nobody look at the spread sheets and notice the issue? <br />
<br />
This isn't Blizzard's notorious fit and finish, and dedication to making it right, the first time. This isn't fine tuning the boss fights, or adjusting trash, this is hard coded numbers that were in a spreadsheet and reviewed and approved by the devs in authority. With the vast experience in design and playing their own game, how did no-one see this? <br />
<br />
They took a simple concept - raid dungeons, and have overcomplicated them to the point where there's nothing but confusion and uncertainty among the players. Now, players will hoard every drop they get, because now the numbers on them might change down the road. Now players face a convoluted path of progression, when it should be simple - beat a harder boss, get better loot. Now they get to min-max across multiple levels of bosses and difficulty. It shouldn't be this hard. These guys have a massive wealth of experience covering 14 years or more of experience designing and playing this game. This kind of thing should be plug and play at this point. That's its not...that's the crux of the issue, and where the train is going to derail down the road.</div></div><hr />

You, like many others, happily confuse peak subs with the cause for an influx of players to the game - which was not mid Wrath, but everything before hand. <br />
<br />
As for Disc, I don't read stat weights or follow guides - I do my own math, I'm weird like that; coupled with play testing. If you're bored I welcome you to conduct an experiment - grab all blue 630 ilevel multistrike gear you can get, and hop into 5 mans. Then grab a combo of haste/crit/mastery gear in any configuration you pls and go back. <br />
<br />
Log it, and ponder. <br />
<br />
And lastly, this is a public forum - you have no less right to counter my opinions or arguments, then I do yours. Replying in a condescending manner is neither polite, or well regarded - as I'm sure you're not appreciating my tone right now, nor clever. It is however, quite hypocrite ;) <br />
<br />
You do have a valid point - the game has changed. It is impossible for what essentially is a living product, and a living market to stay the same. That said, my post called for reevaluating decisions, looking at the good and the bad, and drawing conclusions to shape up the game ahead of us. <br />
<br />
I don't see this happening. From my perspective it's a frantic struggle with the game itself coupled with brilliant marketing insight.</div></div><hr />

blizzard had been tuning raids harder and harder for years now to the point where they had to introduce lower difficulties cause they tuned harder to hard for most - are you really surprised that this was bound to break at some point ? it seems its finally time when they tuned content too tight and people just turned back on it and decided at some point its just not worth effort - highly doubt mythic will live past this expansion - my assumption they will scrap it and next time well get maybe some hardmodes of few bosses a la ulduar style with mythic gone entirely.</div></div><hr />

Reality, guilds are dying left and right. There's more than one reason for that though. Some of it's difficulty, but part of it is also the 20 man roster. There were a lot more 10 man heroic guilds and many of them are struggling majorly. The difficulty is a more complicated issue. Basically now the entire group has to be on the A game for personal responsibility. Having to double the roster amidst a tier that had been on farm for so long ended up with substandard recruits for many. <br />

<br />
To be fair you say many 10 man guilds have fallen apart, but a lot of those players have simply joined other previously 10 man guilds in order for a better raiding experience and the ability to enter mythic, I personally enjoyed the 10man raiding more but I think people over exaggerate the negative effects of the mythic size raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heroic is/was normal, intended for guild groups to gear and progress onto heroic (now mythic).<br />
I know how those various levels were introduced. At the time, there WAS a difference between Flex and Normal. Flex was flexible. Normal was fixed rosters, with benching (sorry, we're 12 tonight, 2 people sit out).<br />
<br />
However, that was in MoP. As of 6.0, the difference between flex and heroic vanished.<br />
<br />
That's what I'm saying. Given the way raids are structured, there are three different forms of raiding, and one is simply duplicated with higher numbers. If you consider that there should be a normal/heroic, why stop at 2. Why not have normal (655), hard (670), heroic (685), legendary (700), with exactly the same mechanic, just higher HP and damage?<br />
<br />
<br />
IMO the new names are the issue not the amount of tiers, they should have kept them called flex/normal/heroic<br />
Except that your &quot;normal&quot; is flex. With just higher numbers.<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing about difficulty levels. I'm arguing that there are three different forms of raiding, but one is duplicated, which leads to two unfortunate consequences:<br />
<br />
1) Blizzard can be lazy with tuning, and you're expected to get heroic gear before you finish normal (see Blizzard example about guild doing heroic before finishing Mar'gok. Oh, and don't forget that you can't do some bosses on heroic, then continue on normal; you need to re-kill those early normal bosses and rot their loot. I miss LK adjustable difficulty)<br />
2) You get a slightly faster ilvl inflation due to an additional tier shoehorned<br />
<br />
But, I guess from Blizzard's POV, it has a useful purpose: you need to redo the same content (at a higher difficulty) to progress, they don't have much work tuning that additional content (just scale stuff by 10% for 15ilvl more gear) which means they get more time before they have to provide a new content patch.<br />

Since we get various hints about 6.2 being when we finally get the last zone (Tanaan), which means possibly the last major raid (don't forget that Yahoo financial analyst stating that they've got the next expansion ready to unveil), there might be a temptation to stretch slightly the middle raid a bit, so that you don't get 10 months of 6.2 before the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that you are doing double the dps as 680 compared with someone at 630 says it all, the jump is not needed, by increasing the reward even higher ilevel, you are making it worse. By the end of this expansion, a char fully geared for last tier mythic could possibly be doing five times more damage than a 630 geared char, that's ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Then we will be back to try and item squish all over again.</div></div><hr />

It isn't an issue as they have already stated that they plan to have more stat squishes in the future...</div></div><hr />
