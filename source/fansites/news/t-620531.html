The trick here is pallies have to think on how they use all their mana, not run all their abilities every cooldown. You know, like how warriors can be rage starved. Hurts burst a lot, but isn't so bad if geared/skilled in a longer fight.</div></div><hr />

I will think the CD on pallies abilities would somehow already cause them to think before popping stuff uselessly but hey... And with the fact that now our mana regen is useless, our mana returns are useless and with the combined survivabilities of other classes (not to mention we wouldn't be able to do squat in terms or dmg), hurray to arena, where we are going to be kited and mana drained. Well if we don't have a mana drain ability, just give us some time, oom is just around the corner - once again. Which isn't very different from before. Yea, some pallies were good in Arena but if the fight is not over in say 5 mins that usually means the ret pally is going to lose. And oww level 80, 20k + hp while we busy going around doing 1.5k max crit YAY!</div></div><hr />

yes I'm glad for that, because it was starting to get really fucking annoying having to reapply GBoM every time a warrior felt like having 1 more AP. the only good thing about these changes. and seriously i could understand a bit of a nerf to Judgements of the Wise because it was a bit OP but down to 15% its almost fucking pointless, maybe 25% wouldve been an acceptable change. but if they are going to do that much to it they should take the Judgements off the global CD</div></div><hr />

This would be an awesome response but some retards out there who didn't suffer the holiness back in Vanilla wow would go out there shout hurrah I can heal. I for one will go ahead and do this, I will keep an eye on mmo-champion and return when there is a fix. If that comes before my long awaited game, cool if it does...though. And for those of you wondering what this long awaited game is watch a video (I would suggest the one called GStar 2007 Trailer - but keep in mind that is an old one, the game looks x10 better now):<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chmee</div><div class="date">2008-10-25, 06:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a raiding ret pally i'm awfully hurt by the sudden nerf to ret after making it a viable and interesting class. I thought the new tree was an awesome response to the poor quality of damage output that ret was able to perform in TBC. I would ask of blizzard to seriously test and verify that these seemingly heavy adjustments to ret do not take the class back down to the level it was in TBC as well as maintaining the integrity of the class as it currently is in 3.0. I think its a terrible waste to bring warrior/ret/DK(dps) classes to wearing the same gear for armor pen and would petition them to keep divine storm as holy damage and if it is &quot;to bursty&quot; adjust it so that it does not proc seals so that ret can have a more &quot;individualized&quot; gear set by stacking haste over armor pen. I also feel that lowering our regular damage output with seals seems a bit rash and I would hope that the percentage that they are lowering these seals by are making it so ret keeps with the &quot;curve&quot; of dps as we level to 80 in WOTLK. I have raided into BT and Hyjal as a ret pally and am able to maintain a spot in the top 5 or so in the raid pre 3.0 but never had a chance at being anywhere close to the top 2 or 3 because they were rogues/mages/locks and I hope as I raid in wrath I will have the ability to compete for the top dps in the raid as well as be a viable class for 5 mans and the occasional pvp/arena as it currently is in the 3.0 patch.</div></div><hr />

But then we did that in 2.4.3. Arena? Well you'll continue to see a lot more at ~1600-1800 until other classes can get their act together.<br />
<br />
Fundamentally this is an ~10% nerf to Paladin Raid DPS at 80 when the spec was already behind the curve and a significant reduction in DPS longevity, to the extent that &gt;3 minute fights are going to become a 'why didn't we bring that 3rd Rogue?' struggle. It's a nerf to Arena viability and you'll probably once again see very few in 2v2 and 3v3, esp. at 80. Ironically Paladins become more vulnerable in 3.0.3 than 2.4.3, though burst has improved relative to health pools at 70. But if Ret burst wins you games at 80 you'll be in the 1500 bracket.<br />
<br />
And yet still everyone will complain well into the expansion because of these 3 weeks before Wrath goes live when they couldn't L2P.</div></div><hr />

I know Ret needed a nerf damage-wise, but what it really needed was to swap out most of the EXTRA burst damage for more PVP utility. Still no good spell interrupts, mana drains, mortal debuffs, etc. There's an extra CC ability that damage breaks (yay) in the tree, but it's on a huge cooldown.<br />
<br />
Holy is now officially THE WORST DPS spec of every single class in the entire game. It'll be like trying to solo as a level 60 prot paladin when AQ first came out.<br />
<br />
Paladins got hit with a Titan's Grip dual-wielding Nerf hammer, the other hybrids were slightly nerfed, the other classes got buffed, and warlocks got sweet lovin'. Everything is back to where it was preBC.<br />
<br />
Blizzard thinks that by giving paladins 2 weeks of completely absurd level 70 PVP abilities that would balance out by level 80 it undoes all of the massive mistakes they've made with the class. Wroooooooooooong.<br />
<br />
They're like warriors that suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I'll be interested to see how the JotW nerf affects me. Currently I think JotW may be a little OP, but I think nerfing it in half is too much. Right now JotW restores about 1k mana, and I'm guessing after the nerf it's more like 500. This means I won't be able to throw in a consecrate and stay around full mana. With viper sting/mana drain on me though, I'm thinking that it might make me an oomadin again, and that is a horrible thing (yay hitting for white damage all the time!).<br />
<br />
I love my ret pally. I don't want to play any other class. If they nerf us into the ground and make it frustrating to play again, I'm just not going to play.<br />
<br />
IMO Blizz has completely destroyed any trust they built by going back on their word completely. Instead of just nerfing our crit, they nerfed us across the board (total damage, mana regen, raid utility). Now instead of being a true melee class we are again somewhere between a ranged and a melee, that dreaded hybrid class which Blizz has said they wanted to eliminate.<br />
<br />
Maybe it'll be better if I take a break for a month or two anyway, while everyone does the quests so I don't have to wait for spawns / fight for drops. If they haven't fixed it by then, maybe I will be better off without this game, if it will be frustrating to play.</div></div><hr />

well, before i wasnt able to go oom, when dpsing all out on mobs, having judgment on cooldown all the time, just for the regen, and who said consecration? never thought of it in a dps rotation(one that you would take serious obviously), due to insane mana cost and tbh, no real dmg benefit? unless youre tank.. and i would call it a tank skill tbh, but i dunno, might just be me... ^^</div></div><hr />

That seems really weak to me. I wish they'd just fold Seal of Command/Judgement of Command into existing abilities. (i.e. let any judgement crit on a stunned/incapacitated target) The seal/judgement is no longer differentiated enough to be interesting, and the class already has plenty of seals.<br />
<br />
Also: bonus! Now the +10% boss armor will also be effecting DS! Woooooo!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now you crit for 3k, and have 1.2k additional (an even 40%).<br />
Thus you total damage at 4.2k<br />
<br />
500 damage nerf, from one example. For bosses that have 4, 5 million+ hp, I don't know if this will add up. For now, seems minor, and easily tweakable. It'll be interesting to see if a strategy develops to keep righteous vengeance up all the time, for max dps, or if refreshing the duration ends up to be a bad thing, since you minimize the extra 40% done to the boss. We'll see how things turn out.</div></div><hr />

All of these are needed nerfs, as Paladins of all specs are doing more damage than they should across the board and have infinite mana in the 25-man PvE raid environment under full buffs. While Holy is supposed to have some DPS on par with what any other healing spec has, they're not supposed to be able to put up the same numbers as a DPS spec while maintaining full healing ability. Ret's DPS is still pretty bonkers in Sunwell... our resident Retadin is still at the top of the charts on single target fights even after all the hotfixes. And Prot is still stupid when it comes to damage and threat. One class is not supposed to be better than any other in practically EVERY area of the game.<br />
<br />
Hey, look at it this way. SV Hunters were just as overpowered in the beta, we gloated about it and exploited Lock and Load Explosive Shots to the point of the entire beta community nerd raging about it. Guess what happened? Not only did they nerf Lock and Load and Explosive shot, but practically neutered the entire SV tree. People of the Paladin class did the same, now it's Paladin's turn to get the nerfbat.</div></div><hr />

You are so hideously misinformed. Holy paladins were already the very bottom of the barrel for healer DPS. The absolute very bottom. We were saying we'd really like at least as much power as the other healers so we can you know... have our daily quests not be weeklies. We were told that was going to happen and now we've found out the bottom of the barrel is twice as deep as we thought it was.<br />
<br />
All other healers can put out far more DPS than a holy paladin while maintaining full healing ability. What's wrong with us being even a close 4th place rather than an extremely distant one?<br />
<br />
Holy paladins weren't even killing anything. Stop mixing ret and holy up.</div></div><hr />

You do know that Holy Shock and Hammer of Wrath aren't your only DPS abilities, right? Equip an actual melee weapon (anything without spell power), DPS like a Retadin, toss in some Holy abilities. Works quite well for me. <br />

What I like in this is the &quot;OVERWRITES&quot; part, we are sooo screwed. You guys complaining about the nerf don't know what paladins are talking about. You are saying Ret was OP, ok I am Ret, say I said: ok, cool we are OP nerf us. WHY THE FUCK would you go nerfing SHIT that has NOTHING to do with my dmg? Why would you touch our mana regen capacity? Why would you nerf all my judgements... ALL OF THEM?! Then 5 point FIVE for what? Some shit that keeps refreshing REGARDLESS of what attack crits (even if that means the refresh is lower than the previous crit - are you insane?). Isn't the new DoT suppose to be some shit that works like the warrior deep wounds, wasn't that what they said? DIDN'T BLIZZARD SAY THAT? My highest crit at level 80 is 3k... THREE? Fighting people that have 20k health easy, I am hitting for 3k with almost 3k AP? ARE YOU SHITTING ME? Breath... Breath... Take deep breaths calm yourself. <br />
For those pallies out there right now saying why are they planning to quit, Blizzard said if it is too much they will reverse it... Guess what, it's too much and if you have hope blizzard would fix it, guess what, it ain't happening. Those of us that have been here have suffered this before, the entire wow 1.0, if you are not holy you are soloing period. WoW 2.0 if you are not holy or prot (at later times), no one wants to talk to you. Now 3.0 and AGAIN they are screwing everything. The saddest part, I don't mind them nerfing DS, I really don't but making it physical? Why Blizzard... why? Making it physical isn't nerfing it, it's destrying the baseline of the skill itself 51 point for ANOTHER CS? COME ON. You know what, fuck all this, I dare ya... Just go live with this shit... JUST... TRY... IT...<br />
<br />
PS: I don't know about other but I am sooo sick of having to play a new class everytime blizzard decides to take one of the existing class and /asswipe with it. Everytime a new patch comes out in this freaking game you have to go to a different class to make it worth your time. I say never again, I will play my paladin and WoW is not the only place I can find one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. This is one of the things I don't understand about this and other MMO games, why are people so fatalist about changes. <br />
<br />
I think any Ret paladin has to know that they were too strong overall now. Even on WOTLK Beta not just on live. <br />
<br />
Maybe the changes are a bit too much, but they were ruining the game for others so this changes were needed. Anyway if you are crying and giving up the game for a PATCH... Good luck on your trip you're not needed here. You all know how MMOs work... or at least you should. The change is in the BETA it's being tested, some stuff will be reverted if they think it's too much. As simple as that. And the nerf today is the buff tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Possible Blizzard is nerfing Paladins so they can revert some of the nerfs and make everyone happy, other classes that were being steam rolled by Palas and Palas by some nerfs reverted.</div></div><hr />

Actually no, not a Moonkin - Restoration/Tree of Life Druid who still happens to raid Sunwell Plateau. You know, PvE - the core of this game ?<br />

<br />
ON my server they actually made guilds &quot;wtf nerf paladin&quot; , &quot;retlol are op&quot;<br />
And such.<br />
<br />
4 of my friends are in beta.<br />
<br />
They say balance is fine at lvl 80.<br />
The whiners cant handle that paladins had great dps at lvl 70... with lvl 80 talents.<br />
<br />
This talents arent made for lvl 70 pvp/pve. But they fuckers dont get it.<br />
<br />
And it just piss me off when paladins said in a blue that &quot;maybe paladin are op , we should check it out&quot;.<br />
<br />
1. All the whiners who got their brains eaten by zombies starts to whine like hell about retri paladins.<br />
2. Noobs who are lvl 35 stands outside durotar and looks at some duels. They start to whine about retri paladins.<br />
3. All those whiners post shitloads of forumtopics with &quot;omg sea theez pics pala is am op lol&quot;<br />
4. They dont have the clue that retri paladins arent that op at lvl 80. The talent builds that are live now is for lvl 80.<br />
5. I dont know why the fuck blizzard comes and nurf all the fucking offensive abilities that paladin has.<br />
6. When wotlk releases and everyone starts to quest up to 80, then they will realise how weak paladins starts to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
And this:<br />
<br />
Before burning crusade: Blizzard can rename the class to healadin. They cant tank and they cant dps.<br />
pre/Burning crusade: Ok cool , we got some nice tank skills. And crusaders strike<br />
, People actually whine alot about this cause it bursts the paladin retridmg. But blizz aint nerfing it to ground. And paladins have to be healers at 70 anyways cant they doesnt got that imba dps.<br />
prewotlk: Divine storm - etc etc. People whines the hell. &quot;Wtf is this? Healadin who dps? Wtf?&quot; Then we get nerfed.<br />
Wotlk: Yayayaayya retpalas dps are like fucking rabbits with Ressurection Sickness and cancer. GOGO LETS PEEVEEPEE!<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah. I can admit this was a QQ post. But i cant fucking stand this. I didnt roll paladin for being a healer.</div></div><hr />

And the sudden flux in numbers of people playing a Retribution Paladin sure has -nothing- to do with it.<br />
<br />
Haha, right-o.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They say balance is fine at lvl 80.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like 'your friends' I'm also in Beta. I played Wintergrasp, I played the new battleground. I can tell you balance is not fine on lvl 80. <br />
<br />
It's similiar to level 70, where the burst people can do is just too damn high. On lvl 80 however it's just more naked and truthful about -who- has the 'OP burst' and who has not. Rogues and Warriors in example are not 'that bad' on lvl 80 when compared to Mages and Retribution Paladins.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah. I can admit this was a QQ post. But i cant fucking stand this. I didnt roll paladin for being a healer.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's why the Paladins got buffed as a hybrid class. And I'm not refering to the 1 AP gain from BoM, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Problem:<br />
The issue with the Nerf is that the judgements of the wise change has completely and utterly killed any hope of ret pve. ever. before you jump on me for crying its the end of the world let me explain. at level 80 we run with base mana (O int on our gear) by nerfing JotW to 15% we can no longer use our dps abilities in PvE. here are some number explaining what will happen<br />
<br />
The Mana Usage:<br />
CS: 8%mana 6sec CD<br />
DS: 12% mana 10sec CD<br />
Judgement 5% mana 8sec CD<br />
totaling about 25%mana usage ever 8seconds. In a 1 minute period we will use 189.5% of our mana<br />
<br />
Mana Returned:<br />
JotW 15% every 8sec<br />
Replenishment .25% every sec<br />
Divine Plea 25%of mana over 15seconds <br />
this will result in a 1 minute period where ret regains 145%of its mana.<br />
<br />
The Results:<br />
Ret will have used 90% of its mana 2minutes into the fight, 2minutes and 12seconds in be completely oom, this class already in the middle of the damage meters have been completely destroyed by this nerf it would be WAY to logical to just bump JotW to 25% so they could carry off there normal dps rotation and leave there gimpy mana pool for 3-4 heals? i guess so, on top of this we had not only our pvp seal nerfed but our pve seal. why would they nerf SoM/SoB in pvp it would result in no burst damage due to the nature of the seal. Due to the complete carelessness and heavy handedness of this nerf this spec has been removed from pve and possibly pvp due to 2 mana burns leaving them oom in wrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After that, unfortunately there are only two things to think:<br />
<br />
1) All other class player's money (and 2 other pally specs) &gt; Ret spec money. If they're unhappy, better make them happy, even if they're stupid enough, it's more money. 1 month of TBC end lvl 70 &gt; 2 years of WotLK it with all the new monster HP, def, resilience, new skills to other classes (new builds with 10 more points from the next 10 lvls... guess what ret can pick for new playstyle with 10 more talent points? Nothing), etc... it would bring...<br />
<br />
2) The same way they finally realized that TG hit penalty (+ heroic leap gone, the other main new stuff for Fury) was way too much, they'll see that some of those nerfs were a bit too much and revert it back one day (before wotlk launch if ret is lucky).<br />
<br />
Still waiting to see the &quot;one or two new fun ret talents&quot; that they said they wanted to see on the spec.<br />
<br />
Wonder when they will apply that to all other classes OP (and some of them, since 1.0 and never touched).It's not only a Ret pally that goes on rampage on pvp &quot;killing everything on sight&quot; in a few seconds at lvl 70.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to hear you explain how exactly holy and prot paladins deserved to be nerfed, too? Holy paladins do the worst DPS of all the healing classes and now they are nerfing us even more. Yet not long ago they themselves admitted holy paladins actually need buff...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The issue is: it affects also prot and holy paladin DPS. Neither holy or prot have anything to replace it with nor do we have any talents regarding Hammer of Wrath.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brand</div><div class="date">2008-10-25, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The funny to me about this is all the hate people have been giving ret paladins and how they needed to be nerfed because of getting ruined in PvP. For virtually the entirety of the game, Ret Paladins have been laughed at by other classes and basically treated like dirt by the community. The developers seemed to have no clue as to what to do with Ret Paladins and basically let them flounder about. Now, they buff paladins (too much unfortunately) and now people are all indignant that they were getting steamrolled by a class that they had poked fun at for all this time. To those people, I say you deserve it. You deserved to be roflstomped by ret pallies who needed to be nerfed (burst wise) and buffed (utility and sustainable DPS wise). If anything, you should have expected Ret pallies to act like jerks considering all they went through. <br />
<br />
But after these latest round of nerfs (which granted aren't on live yet) what the devil Blizzard is thinking. The damage is continually being lowered, as well as JotW, almost to the point where Paladins are really seeing very little buffs to their previous incarnations outside of the reworked judgement system and a couple new skills, with quite a few glaring deficiencies in alot of areas. Holy Paladins have to do more heals with less tools than any other healer and still is dead last in Solo DPS. Prot Paladins have very little to offer in terms of flavor outside of the other tanks, as well as lack a single target taunt (huge) and have lower effective health coupled with the fact that other tanks had their AoE capabilities boosted and Pallys recieved very little in the way of Single Target skills. Ret Paladins are starting to have mana issues again with this latest JotW change, have lackluster on-demand offensive abilities, no way to effectively stick to a target in a PvP setting, and the only thing they really brought to PvP was hit hard with very little to compensate. It's as if now Blizzard has gone from &quot;surgical&quot; to &quot;nuclear&quot; on the Paladin class, and the perception stems from the community outcry. <br />
<br />
So drink up the tears gents, knowing your money is more valued than people who play paladins apparently. As a Prot pally, I have to suffer this change just as much due to the overall Seal dmg nerf and apparent change of HoW to 20% again thanks to continued QQ about Ret Pally DPS. Nerfs were needed, not A-Bombs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i support this post. its gonna suck having to auto attack in boss fights to save enough mana to perform our utility while all the other dps classes are getting clearcasting and mana regens and dont have base mana like a ret pally. ret doesnt wear int, blizz shouldnt be nerfing this. even feral druids got talents to give them endless mana regen! wtf.... and the instant mana burn in pvp is gonna make pallies a joke in no time. nerfing mana regen doesnt effect burst dmg.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to care about the changes because I've been through a lot of buff/nerf/semi-buff for the past 3 years I've played my ret pally, and somehow I've managed to stay between the 3rd-6th place in the damage done meters in (in 40 and 25 men instances). The continuous nerfs and the general condemn to ret pallies made me learn how to play my class better, how to equip it, a good dps rotation, and generally a good knowledge overall about the spec, and made me bitch a lot around to make people give me a chance to prove myself worth in instances and raids. Right now I'm in a guild that would take me as dps without even thinking about it, because they know I'm a good player.<br />
<br />
I think the problem here was even the noob ret paladins (called retardins) were killing skilled and better geared players of other classes. Like a huntard, but with more burst. That needed to be fixed. Good ret paladins will excel with or without the buffs or the nerf, because they know what they're doing.<br />
<br />
I do kinda hate the mana regen buff. I always suffered from oom in raids and this was a VERY nice change, but I guess never going below 90% on you mana bar takes away the reason to even have a mana bar. I just hope I won't go OOM in a short time in raids in the future. <br />
<br />
To the rets out there that jumped to the OP train: LEARN TO PLAY THE CLASS. When you do, you'll realize you can compete with pure dps classes just as good. Things don't come easy. <br />
<br />
To the rets that have always been ret: Who cares about this so called nerfs. We'll still be here because we're good players. We'll still be doing good dps. We like our class and we like our spec. This stuff won't make us quit wow nor reroll another class. At least I know I won't</div></div><hr />

He forgot the mana return you get from the judgement of wisdom YOU SHOULD BE JUDGING on targets...<br />

EDIT: I just noticed he was talking about holy. Sorry. I guess is time you go and autoattack the boss with judgement of wisdom on it, so you can regen your mana.</div></div><hr />

I still consider it a buff. They put it back to an instant cast. That's great. You can run around and hit ppl/mobs under 20% health instead of stopping, casting it, and getting kicked or counterspelled from it -_-</div></div><hr />

pallys will still be beast. and good for em. but like other classes it will depend on gear and skill, no more lvl 67s in greens owning 70s in s2 3v1....<br />

The people he kills at 70 are REALLY bad. No trinkets. Keyboard turners. Mages that don't blink out of the 1 min stun. I could kill them on a level 60 feral druid.<br />

Either way, clearly Bliz didn't think ret palidins were going OOM fast enough. As one previous poster stated, they had forgotten it was even possible to go OOM. All mana users should go OOM if they aren't conscious of their mana usage. Mana conservation is part of game design. If everyone could just spam their highest damage attack and never go OOM, this game would require even LESS skill. It's designed so you have to THINK about what you are doing.

Yeah OK, so EVERY other DPS spec in the game is supposed to spec for increased damage, yet paladins should gem pure INT just so they can complete a damn fight? Sounds like you need to stop drinking bleach.<br />

<br />
Technically everyone DOES only use their highest rank abilities now, as lower ranks do less and cost more mana. However you should be able to last more than a tad over 2 mins in a fight if you are doing more than standing there auto attacking. Sure mana conservation should be part of the game and paladins maybe did have a bit too much regen, but that doesn't mean this nerf isn't way excessive.<br />
<br />
I'm sure if you took all the Mp5/Spirit regen away from a priest and then said, &quot;Can't last long enough, too bad, maybe you should gem for int&quot;,you'd get some &quot;WTF&quot; replies as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It makes sense for a DPS class to have to socket for int!<br />
<br />
Also, Paladins go OOM from CS, DS, and judgment rotations.<br />
<br />
<br />
This gives us 3 mins and 21 sec till we go OOM. <br />
<br />
<br />
(Thought that I'd add that to the top of the message.) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Abilities <br />
Crusader Strike: 8% 6 sec <br />
Divine Storm: 12% 10 sec <br />
Judgement: 5% 8 sec <br />
<br />
Mana Consumed in 2 mins. <br />
1 Seal of Command = 14% <br />
120/6 = 20 CS * 8% = 160% <br />
120/10 = 12 DS * 12% = 144% <br />
120/8 = 15 Judgements * 5% = 75% <br />
<br />
Total: 393% <br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Returned in 2 mins. <br />
15 * 15 = 225% <br />
<br />
(R = Ratio Total Mana/Base Mana) <br />
2 Divine Plea = 2R * 25% = 50% * R <br />
Replenisment R * .25% * 120 = 30% * R <br />
<br />
Total = 225% + (80% * R) <br />
<br />
So given that this calculations use 50 GCD * 1.5 sec = 75 seconds under GCD, it's a fairly accurate representation of what can happen in 2 minutes. <br />
(Although there will be coldowns of skills batting into each other, so it's not a perfect scenario, but it should still be a decent approximation.) <br />
<br />
So..... let's see... we have the equation: <br />
393% - [ 225% + (80% * R) ] <br />
<br />
Which becomes: <br />
<br />
168% - 80% * R <br />
<br />
If it equates to 0, we'll be able to DPS indefinitely. <br />
R = 2.1 <br />
<br />
2.1 * Base mana = 2.1 * 4391 = 9227.4 mana <br />
<br />
..... Yay to Ret Pallies having as much mana as Holy? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I don't know the exact value of R, but let me guess that it's something like 1.2 since I always hear Ret pallies are around 5k mana at 80. <br />
<br />
4391 * 1.2 = 5269.2 (which sounds about right, I think?) <br />
<br />
So 168% - 80*1.2% = 168% - 96% = 72% <br />
Which means we lose 72% base mana per 2 mins. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This gives us 3 mins and 21 sec till we go OOM. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another words, about 2 mins. and 47 seconds, our base mana will dry up. and 3 mins and 21 seconds to run out of our mana completely. <br />
<br />
Now this isn't an totally accurate model, but sometime before 4 mins. We should be out of mana. This is just doing a basic rotation of sealing <br />
every 2 minutes with judgement/CS/DS and discounts spells that's likely cast such as Avenging Wrath or Hammer of Wrath, so I think it balances<br />
out somewhat. However.... 4 mins till mana dry at most. At worst, probably within 2 mins, if using said spells and perhaps even shorter if you <br />
add consecration. <br />
<br />
<br />
Welcome back pallies, we're back in the state we were in TBC! It feels so good to be home again, eh? The ground at the bottom of the barrel feels toooo good to let go...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greven</div><div class="date">2008-10-25, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know... I'm not going to care about the changes because I've been through a lot of buff/nerf/semi-buff for the past 3 years I've played my ret pally, and somehow I've managed to stay between the 3rd-6th place in the damage done meters in (in 40 and 25 men instances). The continuous nerfs and the general condemn to ret pallies made me learn how to play my class better, how to equip it, a good dps rotation, and generally a good knowledge overall about the spec, and made me bitch a lot around to make people give me a chance to prove myself worth in instances and raids. Right now I'm in a guild that would take me as dps without even thinking about it, because they know I'm a good player.<br />
<br />
I think the problem here was even the noob ret paladins (called retardins) were killing skilled and better geared players of other classes. Like a huntard, but with more burst. That needed to be fixed. Good ret paladins will excel with or without the buffs or the nerf, because they know what they're doing.<br />
<br />
I do kinda hate the mana regen buff. I always suffered from oom in raids and this was a VERY nice change, but I guess never going below 90% on you mana bar takes away the reason to even have a mana bar. I just hope I won't go OOM in a short time in raids in the future. <br />
<br />
To the rets out there that jumped to the OP train: LEARN TO PLAY THE CLASS. When you do, you'll realize you can compete with pure dps classes just as good. Things don't come easy. <br />
<br />
To the rets that have always been ret: Who cares about this so called nerfs. We'll still be here because we're good players. We'll still be doing good dps. We like our class and we like our spec. This stuff won't make us quit wow nor reroll another class. At least I know I won't<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly what I wrote before but in more words. The fault is the noobs that were hidding, waiting for a Giant buff, after the buff they all came out of the Caverns where they were hidding. I played some WSGs where 5 players were Paladins, on the other side more 3 Paladins... All Ret, go figure! :| <br />
<br />
When you see an Hybrid Class spec all the same way in PvP or PvE there is a great chance that:<br />
<br />
1. One tree is broken making all the others become useless<br />
2. Two trees are broken and just 1 works.<br />
<br />
The second case was true before TBC and a bit during TBC, now the case applied is 1. Probably these nerfs are too much, they will be balanced. I Don't think Blizzard is bringing the Anti-Paladin the Death Knight without making the Paladin itself be a good class, specially the Melee Counterpart, Retribution Paladin.<br />
<br />
I think people need more patience and to play their class regardless. I know some people that always played Ret because they liked it, not because they are the FOTM Class.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but things aren't tuned that well at 70 and some classes, hybrids especially, are doing way better damage than they should. The game is moving into an expansion in what, 3 weeks?<br />
<br />
Why don't you ask the people for whom it matters! The beta testers. I know in beta when i'm running Naxx, Os, or killing Malygos in 25 man content the Ret paladins were tops or close to tops of the meters (except the unholy DK's on occasion and the hunters). So with the recent slight nerf to hunters and this change to ret paladins maybe...just MAYBE you'll be on par with everyone else at 80.<br />
<br />
Cause you certainly weren't balanced at 80 before this change. So if you're not in the beta just stop the damn QQ'ing cause i bet you won't even see this nerf before the expansion comes out and by the time it matters you'll be levelling to 80 where it was intended to fix.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fakestreet</div><div class="date">2008-10-25, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think people are over-reacting a tad.<br />
<br />
remember pre-3.0 when you have to:<br />
- waste mana and GCD on reapplying seals after every Judgement?<br />
- seal-twist?<br />
- not have any mana return short of JoW?<br />
- actually have to put up SoJ and Judge it to get it on someone?<br />
<br />
and yet Ret did competitive damage for the buff it gave the raid (i can link WWS to prove this) and be in top arena brackets.<br />
<br />
even on this build, Ret is still in heaven compared to TBC. maybe a lower level of heaven compared to post-3.0 but everyone that pays attention to the current state of the game knew something needed to be fixed.<br />
<br />
that said:<br />
1. Judgement nerfs are a bit excessive. if nothing else, it should only be applied to SoC and SoB and revert everything else back for the sake of Holy and Prot.<br />
2. JotW nerf is needed but 15% is probably too low (20-25% is probably more balanced). keep in mind that using the current JotW, i could use every GCD to DPS (including Consecrate on spare GCD), use Art of War to Flash of Light, then continue Flash of Light'ing to full after the fight is over. THAT is too much mana.<br />
3. (undocumented?) Hammer of Wrath nerf (or reversion to be exact) is necessary. noone else has an instant 3k nuke (note it has around 90% crit chance talented atm) at 30 yd range on a 6s CD. the reason Ret burst is really high is because everyone (at 70) essentially had a 30% HP deficit even before the fight started (assuming average HP of 10k).<br />
4. change to Righteous Vengeance is fair because it downplays crit strings and benefits steady damage more. sure you'd do &quot;less dps&quot; during crit strings but if you spread it out over an entire boss fight, i think it's more or less the same dps.<br />
<br />
overall, i think it does display Blizz's intention to downplay the burst except for the Judgement nerfs which is harsh across the tree (and hopefully be reverted).</div></div><hr />

and i suppose you've never seen Enhancement Shamans?<br />

Enhancement post-3.0 has more abilities to use and the same mana regen (Shamanistic Rage - on a 2 min cd). honestly though, even Rogues can't spam Mutilate/SS because the energy cost per GCD is greater than the energy regeneration rate and Warriors don't just spam every move on CD because of rage generation. in short, atm only Ret can spam every single DPS abilities they have on every GCD without worrying about resources (mana).</div></div><hr />

But I have some perspective over it, since it's not the only class I play.<br />
<br />
Now, I also have a resto druid, and I play arena with it. let me tell you, it's not fun at all, I have 3 brutal pieces, 450 ress, more than 11k hp as a healer, and I'm getting killed in about 4 global cd.. it's avenging wrath, stun, crit from judgment with 40% more dmg and 50% by passing any dmg reduction, 1 white dmg or someone esle to crit me (warrior that charge), then &gt;35%, so with talents, it's a 83% chance that they crit me with hammer, then &lt;20% and execute from his warrior partner. <br />
<br />
all that, even if I trinket the first stun since the warrior is charging me right after the pala. I'm dead in 6 sec, with resli caped.. if you don't call that OP.. I don't know what is.<br />
<br />
On matches that last a bit longer, make it 3 min (that's already 2 avenging wrath by the way), when I die, I see paladins FULL hp AND MANA, when me, or a mage, or priest, or ANY OTHER CLASS with mana that tried to burst, and can still heal are nearly oom. I mean, bursting is one thing, but when you can still bubble, have good heals and you are still 100% with mana, that's crazy OP.<br />
<br />
I haven't played beta, so I don't know if paladins are ok at lvl 80, but right now, all the classes with lvl 80 talents are OP anyway.<br />
<br />
about the &quot;bleed&quot; that overwite the first one.. humm, have you guys EVER played another class, like a mage maybe? it's exacly the same thing, so what's the fucking big deal??? yeah, it's not perfect and it shouldn't be. <br />
<br />
Now I see warrior going prot with dps gear, paladin going ret with holy gear, which makes endless mana + CC+ burst... I was waiting for a nerf PLAYING A PALADIN AS MY MAIN CHARACTER. I'm just mad a the changes they made for holy and prot in the process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just wanted to post some info regarding the JotW nerf, i play a paladin and realize our burst needed fixing however here is something you may want to take into account.<br />
<br />
The Problem:<br />
The issue with the Nerf is that the judgements of the wise change has completely and utterly killed any hope of ret pve. ever. before you jump on me for crying its the end of the world let me explain. at level 80 we run with base mana (O int on our gear) by nerfing JotW to 15% we can no longer use our dps abilities in PvE. here are some number explaining what will happen<br />
<br />
The Mana Usage:<br />
CS: 8%mana 6sec CD<br />
DS: 12% mana 10sec CD<br />
Judgement 5% mana 8sec CD<br />
totaling about 25%mana usage ever 8seconds. In a 1 minute period we will use 189.5% of our mana<br />
<br />
Mana Returned:<br />
JotW 15% every 8sec<br />
Replenishment .25% every sec<br />
Divine Plea 25%of mana over 15seconds <br />
this will result in a 1 minute period where ret regains 145%of its mana.<br />
<br />
The Results:<br />
Ret will have used 90% of its mana 2minutes into the fight, 2minutes and 12seconds in be completely oom, this class already in the middle of the damage meters have been completely destroyed by this nerf it would be WAY to logical to just bump JotW to 25% so they could carry off there normal dps rotation and leave there gimpy mana pool for 3-4 heals? i guess so, on top of this we had not only our pvp seal nerfed but our pve seal. why would they nerf SoM/SoB in pvp it would result in no burst damage due to the nature of the seal. Due to the complete carelessness and heavy handedness of this nerf this spec has been removed from pve and possibly pvp due to 2 mana burns leaving them oom in wrath.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you had any idea of what you just posted you would realize that you just proved that by using only these DPS spells and not adding in consecration or heals you will have very high mana sustainability. First off you don't go through 189.5% mana/min you need to add in GCDs and if you have them hasted down to 1s (most possible) the amount of spells that you calculated casting would add in over 20s of GCD. Now you are going through 189.5% of BASE mana roughly every minute and twenty seconds, but you regen 145% of TOTAL mana every minute. Now we all know retadins dont stack int so it will roughly equal regenning about 145%-155% of your BASE mana/minute depending on how much int you do actually stack. <br />
Thus in a 4 minute fight:<br />
4min/1min20s=3 3*189.5= 568.5% = Total mana usage<br />
4min/1min =4 4*145 = 580.0% = Total mana regen<br />
<br />
You regen more mana than you use like it says in the post (We think you can go almost indefinetely on mana by using Divine Storm, Crusader Strike and a Seal / Judgement. If you want to add things to that, Consecration, Hammer or a heal perhaps, your mana will start to dip, but Divine Plea should make up for that.) <br />
<br />
If you weren't just here to QQ you might try and think of a way to increase your mana regen if you want to add in the other spells like adding some intel to your gear like other mana based DPSers have to do.<br />
<br />
Also blizz posted that once they &quot;fixed&quot; ret DPS they are going to rework Holy DPS, you will be buffed healadins.<br />
<br />
Prot spec I'm sorry you got nerfed but in all honesty does any tank have trouble holding aggro on players that are similarly geared after patch 3.0, Blizz almost completely did away with threat watching (Like they posted) except for the few highest DPSers and if they know how to DPS that well then they should know how to use their aggro reducing ability.<br />
<br />
P.S. That Pally tears cartoon is priceless</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, everyone will be back to prot or holy as soon as this goes live, sad to see really. I honestly don't know what their thinking 17 pally nerfs in one patch even blizz should c that as a bit excessive.<br />
Oh well, live and learn i guess ..<br />
The only thing that sucks is I spent the last couple monthes building a pretty good ret set, and now it's gonna be worthless again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lonan</div><div class="date">2008-10-28, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ret Pladins did need a nerf, it is true.. everyone can see it. This wasn't a case of the QQ winning, it was a case of everyone looking at the situation and going &quot;OMG ret is OP!&quot; With the exception pf a very few shameless and deluded retadins I know every single one knew they were enjoying a wave that was going to crash and return to normalcy at some point. It is true that this may be too much, but that is Blizz's MO lately. They Buff good, nerf hard and repeat untill they are about right. They did it with Warriors of all specs (I remember not to long ago Prot Warriors were out DPSing Arms and Fury, we got nerfed then bufffed and then leveled out.), they've done it with shaman, too. Look at it from Blizzards point of view for a second, making changes like this is the easiest and quickest way to get a lot of data, and they will know if they went too far really soon and rescind a little bit. They've done it over and over in the development of WotLK. <br />
<br />
The changes that effect Holy and Prot DPS are unfortunate but notice that Ghostcrawler did say they were prepared to buff Holy and Prot if need be. That means the are AWARE of the concerns with the changes they are making and are paying attention. I don't forsee these changes being permanent, they will be tweaked and changed untill things are about right. Untill Ret paladins are within 5% of every other DPS class and thus viable. My wild ass guess from the raids and PvP I've done lately is that Ret is much more that 12% or so better than anyone else of equal gear. That is too much,<br />
<br />
So take your QQ and go else where. Time for the development process to work on you guys. Blizz of today is different from Blizz of TBC. It has been shown again and again with their transperancy, speed and candor in changes. They have 11 million paying subscribers to make happy enough to keep playing in the face of competition. They are not out for you mister Retadin, they are out for making everyone as close to happy as possible, give em some damn time and see how it ends up. Throwing a 2 year olds temper tantrum over one very experimental round of nerfs is idiotic and does not help your case. Work with them not against them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly I don't see myself playing wotlk.<br />
<br />
making my favorite character useless in the role that I've always played him in is a terrible way to do business. <br />
<br />
wtg blizz, you just lost a paying customer.<br />
<br />
<br />
LoL deal with it same thing happened to feral druids back in the day and you cant deny you were a little OP. <br />
Feral was worthless in Arena for over 4 seasons. Deal with the nurf play the class you like and move on. As the above poster states Bliz is gathering data and you need to give it time if this nurf is enough to make you quit wow then honestly I am not even sure how you made it to 70 in the first place.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vrachara</div><div class="date">2008-10-29, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys, relax. If these changes are too much, they'll buff you to decency again.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure on Holy... never had a healer as main, tried to grind a few times while I was specced resto with my druid though, it sucked. If you think you need a buff over these changes, ok, go for it, I won't comment.<br />
<br />
But protection paladin DPS in raids is just insane. Now, I have no perspective over level 80, so excuse my comment if it drastically changes then, but right now I tend to see a protection paladin near the top of the meters. Sorry, but that's wrong, you're supposed to be below the DPS (and these aren't just crap players who don't know what to do with their class) just like any other tank. And don't think I'm talking about rogues being lower than a protection paladin on MH waves, it's not about the AoE capability.<br />
<br />
On the topic of retri nerf, which seems to be the hot topic, sorry to say, according to what I've seen at 70 (again, no perspective over 80; if it was bound to change through something, disregard my comment, but I've seen a lot of people saying they keep it up then), it's really nuts. Our retri pala, a good player at that is on top of DPS every single fight. Now, he's a good player and I know he can get a lot out of his class, but the margin by which he's leaving other DPS behind is a bit too much.<br />
<br />
Your mana did need addressing. But with all the testing, it seems Blizzard swinged the nerf bat too hard again. Don't get depressed over it, they do it all the time. From what I've seen, they're learning faster now and fixing stuff much faster than they used to. If it's not done by Wrath, you're more than likely to see it done in a patch that'll be out before you reach 80.<br />
<br />
Take a breather, sit back and enjoy the game. If you're rerolling due to nerfs, sorry to say, but that's quite sad, you should try playing a class you like, not a class that's best at something. And if you quit over them... well remember to send a gift basket to whoever was responsible for these changes ;)</div></div><hr />

before the new talents came out paly was just strong but mana problems so now you guys are just to strong now<br />
so dont see why the nerf is a problem maybe should only have paladins in the game and take out locks, mage, rogue etc<br />
<br />
anyway those with paladins in 2weeks will stop crying</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tektik</div><div class="date">2008-10-31, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, I agree the ret paladins were made to be quite overpowered with the patch. I went from needing a healer and a rogue to take on an MS warrior to being able to solo a well-geared one IF I used all of my cooldowns. It bugged me to see fresh level 70 retadins almost beating me in BGs, when I had worked so hard for the gear I was using, and they had their S0.<br />
<br />
Paladins were the hardest class to level, a combination of bad damage output and being mana starved. To those of you who say &quot;but you can heal! That's a clear advantage over strict melee classes!&quot; BITE ME! Like it's actually hard to level First Aid or buy food, Healing myself takes mana, i.e. I have to drink in order to replenish that mana, and if I heal during combat, then I'm OOM even faster, thus being less productive than using the mana to deal damage. With these nerfs, paladins will be EVEN HARDER to level from 70 to 80, and not only that, for those of us who DON'T play on a carebear server, we won't be able to hold our own in pvp. So, good f-ing game on giving paladins a clear disadvantage in Wrath, should these changes become live, as we will be the last class to reach 80 with more effort than anyone else.<br />
<br />
Addressing the mana situation: yes, having infinite mana totally defeats the purpose of a mana bar. BUT with all of the mana regen buffs that can occur in a raid (Totems, Spriests, JotW, etc.) mana should not be a huge problem, people spend talent points and use certain abilities in order to maintain sustainability. If your DPS rotation includes consecration, THEN you should be mana starved, because that move isn't a direct, single-target, offensive ability, meant more for, the obvious, AoE situations.<br />
<br />
We are holy swordsmen wielding giant two-handed weapons, wearing thick armor, and delivering justice through divine power, given to us by a higher power. We are a preserver, a protector, someone who does not &quot;go down&quot; very easily. <br />
<br />
As hard as I have worked, in the past, to even be noticeable in PvP, I think that paladins should be a good tool to force other classes to actually learn how to play their builds in accordance with WHO they are fighting. I fight plenty of rogues who try to fight me, a plate wearer, as a melee only leather wearer, in a one-on-one thinking that by just using evasion, they should win. WRONG. They are melee with lots of stuns, CCs, and other cooldowns, USE THEM! Against a good rogue, or other class, the only difference between us would be my OP burst damage, which has clearly been nerfed, and too hard I say.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the four weeks of fun Blizzard! I will try to &quot;enjoy&quot; raiding as a holy paladin, just like you've forced us to do since the beginning of time. And on a side note, I cannot wait to see how crazy and silly the new raiding system will be!</div></div><hr />
