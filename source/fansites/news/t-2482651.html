<br />
The sad part is this is true. They won't have learnt their lesson from Immortal and will show mobile games that nobody asked for on the main stages.<br />
<br />
And at this rate a WoW expansion won't help as most people have moved on from that game and if they continue with the current design philosophy won't be successful in bringing people back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not rich, but I do love Blizzcon, this will be my 3rd one.. I am starting to believe that either I am extremely lucky to get a ticket 3 years in a row OR there are some geographical factors that come into play that give me a better chance (from the UK).</div></div><hr />

thats because with each year wow playerbase get older and also more succesfull irl - while others waste their lives on &quot;achieving stuff &quot; in hardmodes :)<br />
<br />
for a lot of people 500 $ is 1-2 days of work . why shouldnt they buy it if they can afford it. <br />
<br />
most will pay much more for plane tickets to get there anyway .</div></div><hr />

<br />
500 in 2 days is quite a bit steep, the AVG is about 857 per week in the US or 44k a year.<br />
<br />
EU is usually a bit lower depending on country, but that's all Gross pay and a lot of EU countries pay hella taxes.</div></div><hr />

They sell out instantly because there are magnitudes more people who want to buy vs the number of tickets. A small price raise isn't going to scare away actual fans.</div></div><hr />

The first minute of the video; describing what, and how the information is being used. <br />
Is actually fucked-up, regardless of statistical significance. This is systematic invasion of privacy from a private entity. <br />
Furthermore... this private entity that you paid to take your information. Turns around, and sells this information/data.<br />

His comment was towards the app you have to install to be able to comfortably use the ticket ... the app asks for permission to have access to your contacts, camera, gps, wifi, bluetooth, internet in general, be able to modify system settings on your phone, keep your credit card info and purchases history and be able to sell that info to anyone that pays enough. There is long list of other permissions it requires, if you are interested, it is easy to google it.<br />
<br />
The app has 2/5 rating on google play and even lower on other rating sites.</div></div><hr />

You’re kidding right? Do you know how dumb that would be of them to do that? First off just getting a ticket doesn’t mean shit if the person can’t take time off work or school. Not to mention afford the travel fees and hotel and food etc. How would they even go about this? If they sent free tickets to everyone who’s been subbed for ten years, do they just make plans expecting everyone will show up who got a ticket? Or do they plan half will and half won’t? What if too many show up and there isn’t enough space? What if not many show up and it leaves the area empty thus depriving others of access? There’s no way they could do this even if they wanted to. It would be a logistical nightmare of epic proportions. <br />
<br />
And while Blizzcon was once for fans it’s onviously not anymore. It’s a money maker. That stupid portal pass proves it. But it is what it is. Fans will buy it and thank Blizzard for the opportunity so why not? <br />
<br />
Also most people who go there see it more than an advertisement. It’s an epic event to meet new people and just to have fun.</div></div><hr />

The reality is that there's not much difference at all. <br />
<br />
It's not an endorsement of the app but any sort of app that involves financial transactions is doing much the same thing. If you're using any kind of app to buy movie tickets, concert tickets or much of anything else there's very little difference in any of them.</div></div><hr />

I beg to differ. I use ticket app on my phone as well and in their terms and conditions they explicitely state that they do not sell or transfer my data to anybody else. Something blatantly missing in the AXS app terms and conditions.</div></div><hr />

Seems almost identical to the terms and conditions of the Map My Run app I use, and probably millions of other apps out there if people read the fine print. I won’t argue that AXS might be a bit shadier as I really don’t know and some of the things they do seem a bit excessive. As the app has been around a while and this is the first most people have heard about I would say it’s probably not as major as let on, but again, that doesn’t mean there aren’t problems with it.<br />

I would pay the base ticket price, but definitely not the higher priced tickets. That said, I would love to go but I’m broke from the last convention I went to, house repairs I have to do, and an upcoming vacation. Luckily, it’s can watch it on YouTube for the highlights.</div></div><hr />

Even years are years where nothing is guaranteed. Odd years always have a WoW expansion as the main theme and likely this year they'll hit us with a D4 even if it means breaking the &quot;Don't announce anything more than a year away.&quot; rule they kind of have.<br />

As for AXS is it a Blizzard choice or Anaheim centre choice. Because most centres seem to be the ones that run the who gets to be the guys that sell tickets, not those running the events.</div></div><hr />

Base ticket price is $330, and the extra $30 hike is a drop in the bucket when you factor in the total price of the trip (flight + hotel + food + merch) that most people will spend. Especially since most people who attend build a whole vacation around it, with Disneyland being right next door, and all the other stuff to do around there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 330$ is already crazy for me. When I see that I got in gamescom for 20$. But since I never was at blizzcon, so there must be something about it that makes it worthwhile to fans. But okay, it is several days, and has a music closing act. I guess it costs a fair amount of money to hast in the first place.</div></div><hr />

and its ok . there are milions of people who wont buy them <br />
<br />
but there are also hundreds of thousands of people who are more then willing to pay even more just to get VIP treatment :) that feeling of just passing gates while tens of thousdands are stuck in couple of hours que is worth much more for them . also this saves them a lot of time and strength . time is money - i would also much rather go to gym in hotel in morning and then eat nice breakfest instead wait like caddle in huge que. <br />
<br />
thats why i bet you a lot of people were aiming at VIP tickets first. and after they realised they cant get them they settled for normal tickets</div></div><hr />

Judging by the Footmen appearing on peoples email receipts I think it's safe to say Warcraft 4 or a Warcraft RTS game is a given.<br />

Going by their job listings and their own words at Blizzcon last year that their dev teams were keenly interested in developing mobile games plus Diablo Immortal exists, I wouldn't be surprised if something like the Blizzard Mobile Suite was one of their upfront projects to showcase at this Blizzcon this year. Not to mention there is unlikely to be an unveiling of a new expansion for any of their current IPs (aside from HS) unless they plan to cut off the current WoW expansion soon and Diablo 4 is still years out in their own words. Otherwise it'd be more of the usual stuff and maybe some new panels on their remasters and classic and the future of those projects. The only thing that would be out of nowhere would be a completely new IP considering how their investors and management are more focused on quick returns and delivery atm.</div></div><hr />

It's fine if the poster makes a guess, but he stated that as a fact rather than his opinion.<br />

<br />
Has nothing to do with greed. People have to work in order to set up the convention for the weekend. You have to pay for the workers. If less people went to the convention than the costs can be cut down and the tickets will be cheaper. But since more people goes every year, the convention only gets bigger so it makes sense for the prices to go up.</div></div><hr />

No.<br />
<br />
What's stupid is you need a phone with what is basically Spyware installed just for a convention so they can claim people &quot;have phones and were using them&quot; as a statistic to push their mobile garbage nobody asked for. God forbid people don't want their main phone which probably has a lot of personal info on with how smartphones work these days infested with garbage like that.<br />
<br />
That's Blizzards mantra these days. &quot;It must be popular if the majority is doing it&quot;. No phones were popular there because you basically forced it.<br />
<br />

Fun fact, when I went to C2E2 I needed a phone to participate in some events. Also, if I purchased a ticket for a meet n greet or photo op with a celeb I needed my phone to prove I purchased a ticket.<br />
Also, I get that AXS accesses a lot on your phone, but most of it is the exact same that other apps utilize as well. UnderArmour, for instance, accesses and saves information off of the MapMyRun app from things such as device type, payment info, gps location, advertisements clicked on, and items purchased just to name a few.<br />
As I stated in a previous post, I do think AXS goes overboard as it also saves things like OS and IP, but most of what they access is pretty standard for a lot of apps that include purchasing items.<br />
What I’m mostly curious about at this point is if AXS being used is Blizzard’s decision or the venues.</div></div><hr />

The tickets are just extremely overpriced. It's a well known fact.<br />
<br />
Most conventions like this are between $50-150 at most. I paid £120 for my ticket for a convention I went to back in February.<br />

I guess I won't be going to Blizzcon at all then. Why does an app that generates a QR Code need *ALL* those permissions?<br />
<br />
Or better yet why can't people just use their tickets like they always have been doing at Blizzcon instead of ActiBlizz forcing some Spyware App on them?</div></div><hr />

DoN't yOU gUys hAvE pHoNEs :) ?<br />
<br />
To be fair, mobile ticket apps are not a big issue and actually can be a useful tool for all sides ... problem is the ticket app Blizz picked is utter garbage. <br />
<br />
It's the Diablo mobile press release situation all over again. Ppl who make decisions at Blizz are growing increasingly disconnected with their playerbase.<br />
<br />
And yeah. It's not hart problem to solve. Buy a burner phone for 100 bucks and install the 550 bucks ticket on it and after the show is over just throw the phone away. Easy soultion. But still kind of annoying.</div></div><hr />

I mentioned it before. I have other ticket app on my phone. It's rated 4.7/5 on Google Play (Axs has a tragic score of 2/5 on Google Play and worse on other rating services). My ticket app terms of use explicitely state that it does not share my data with anyone else. Axs app explicitely states that it does share my data with other partners. Why is Blizzard using a poorly reviewed highly invasive ticket app instead of better alternatives ?<br />
<br />
And the argument that there are other 4 apps that steal your data so you shouldn't mind a 5th or 6th or 15th one stealing and selling your data is stupid.<br />
<br />
It's a risk vs reward situation. Ppl can risk FB doing something with their data, but that does not mean that every other their activity should require another app on their phone stealing and selling their data. FB will probably be sort of carefull what it can and cannot do with your data. Some random Axs app can gamble big and if it breaks the law and goes up in flames, whatever.</div></div><hr />

It’s got a 4.6/5 on the App Store on my iPhone. With approximately 36k reviews there vs approximately 2k reviews on Google Play. Which one do we go by?</div></div><hr />

Yep. It's absolutely sad lol and people are on reddit acting like it's ok.....<br />
<br />
Sad part is it's just going to be used as a metric by Blizzard. Nothing else.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Repefe</div><div class="date">2019-05-05, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It’s got a 4.6/5 on the App Store on my iPhone.

<br />
I imagine that goes in line how iPhone uses don't mind abuse from company they buy stuff from. Apple charges you 500 bucks for repair that should cost 50, tells you your data can't be recovered and delete forum posts that suggest otherwise despite the fact that your data can be recovered and release products that are technologically 1-2 generations behind and still charge hefty premium for them.<br />
<br />
So it can be a matter of sensitivity where Android users give lower scores to apps that exploit them and Apple users just go, meh, we are used to being exploited. Or it can be that Apple version of the app is better. I am not sure which is it. <br />
<br />
But since Blizzard is a PC game developer, or at least used to be, I think they would cater more to the Android crowd, not to the Mac/iPhone crowd in which case the choice of ticket app is a poor one imho.</div></div><hr />

Probably should have waited until more research came out or to see if Blizz was going to stick to using AXS. There’s already been posts disproving what a lot of people are worried about as well as other apps and even online sites doing things like this.</div></div><hr />

Even if you priced it at $1000 there would still be fanboys who would buy it out in a few hours. Brand loyalty is a bitch. Just look at how many $$$ autists threw at Star Citizen for NOTHING.</div></div><hr />

Considering the size of the Event I would still expect Tickets to sell out even at a $1000 cost. Hell there are Concerts for shitty Bands that give far less that cost more than a full weekend at BlizzCon.</div></div><hr />

Haha. You jumped on the hate train tinfoil hat way too soon. This app does nothing new or different than any other social media or purchasing app does.<br />

<br />
The fact they not only raised the price and introduced a 500 dollar ticket that isn't worth 500 dollars is tragic.<br />
<br />
This is called market pricing, and how things almost always work in any industry. You price your goods / services based on what people are willing to pay, not on what it actually costs.<br />
<br />
The whole supply-side economics that libertarians / conservatives try to push was never real.</div></div><hr />

If you liked it then that's fine dude. Nobody is going to &quot;smite&quot; you. :)<br />

What's stupid is you need a phone with what is basically Spyware installed just for a convention so they can claim people &quot;have phones and were using them&quot; as a statistic to push their mobile garbage nobody asked for. God forbid people don't want their main phone which probably has a lot of personal info on with how smartphones work these days infested with garbage like that.<br />
<br />
That's Blizzards mantra these days. &quot;It must be popular if the majority is doing it&quot;. No phones were popular there because you basically forced it.<br />
<br />
Same with carrot on stick rewards in WoW. People do content for rewards. Not because they enjoy it.<br />
<br />
So you reward Blizzards behavior by buying tickets and a new phone to install their crappy spyware app. At this point I'm not sure if you are trolling or just plain stupid.</div></div><hr />

Stupid is buying into the hype train that piled on about this axs app privacy fake news.<br />
<br />
Reading the ACTUAL policy, Axs does none of the things actually doomsayed by the fake news. <br />
<br />
Only 3rd party they share your personal/fiscal data with is the partner involved in the transaction, Blizzard in this situation. Duh, the business you are paying and getting the ticket from needs your info. They need your info to both pay for the ticket...and actually generate the ticket in your NAME.<br />
<br />
You have to OPT IN to the location services bit, and no it cannot automagically turn itself on. The app asks, just like any other app, if you want to enable location services and it can be turned off at any time. Same goes for the bluetooth bit.<br />
<br />
The cookies bit, about targeting ads to you, is exactly the same policy listed on almost every website on the internet. Amazon, Google, this forum, and the list goes on.<br />
<br />
The bit where it might look for your phone contact list info, that is only if you decide to sell the tickets via the app. It does use your phone bits to process that. And again, you have to opt into it.<br />
<br />
Also, just like any other site, it does explain that it MIGHT share your info with basically future owners of the site, protecting itself against being bought, sold, or merging with another company. Again, no different than any other site on the internet. <br />
<br />
I wish people would actually read axs privacy policy, not just the one reddit article that completely twisted the information.</div></div><hr />
