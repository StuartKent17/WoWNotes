<br />
Blizzcon Dev Interview<br />
BlizzPro (http://www.blizzpro.com/blog/2013/11/15/warlords-of-draenor-developer-interview/) had a chance to talk to Technical Director Marco Koegler and Quest Designer Helen Cheng at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
<br />
The goal is to have all of the Vanilla race character models updated for release, but that isn't set in stone.<br />
There might be some clipping with the new cloak animation, so the team is looking at adding some more physics to the cloak rather than just using pure animations. This isn't ready to show off and uses even more CPU, so it may not be the correct solution. <br />
After being boosted to 90 you will have a set of gear that is level appropriate, similar to how the level 80 Scroll of Resurrection boost works.<br />
Time travel is just a means to get players back to Draenor and bring back the classic Warcraft feeling and characters.<br />
As long as players prevent Garrosh from building the Dark Portal for the Iron Horde to invade, there won't be any permanent changes to the current timeline. This will let the story have some fun elements that involve characters from the present without changing the timeline.<br />
The current classes are somewhat balanced, so adding a new class would upset that balance. <br />
There were too many daily quests at the start of Mists of Pandaria, especially after taking into account alts. Warlords will still offer a wide variety of things to do, but it will be more exploring, dynamic events, and story through quests. <br />
If garrisons end up being per character, there will likely be a way to make garrison leveling and improvements faster on an alt. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
New Character Models<br />
Will the new player models will also have new melee attack animations as well? The ones for the older races are rather stale.<br />
All animations have to be redone to work with the new models. We are trying not to make them radically different but will improve. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402539449608699904))<br />
<br />
Remember promising us to update moonkin form since WotlK and saying the glyph won't affect the update? We do.<br />
I try to never promise. This is why. We will do the moonkin at some point, but it is lower priority than the races. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402536011147640832))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Please give options in the Garrison that don't require a daily login. Don't want to be forced to login every day.<br />
The plan is for longer missions for those times when you know you won't be logging in frequently. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/401038719924195328))<br />
<br />
Can we please have the followers in our Garrisons not be limited to player races? think Ogres, Tuskarr, etc<br />
Having some non-traditional races would be a lot of fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/400806029677453312))<br />
<br />
Will you consider race-based garrison design or just faction-based?<br />
Just faction for now. Dividing things by race meant we would have had far less new art per building. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402534987234177024))<br />
<br />
garrisons look awesome, But please dont make them mandatory for professions. Garrisons should be optional &amp; fun. Not a grind.<br />
The intent is to make them fun but they are not optional the way pet battles or brawlers guild was. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403607123273076736))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Flying<br />
What was wrong with the Wrath model of grounded leveling for main, BoA tome for alts?<br />
If leveling is supposed to be trivial for alts, why not just make them all jump to max level? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402533984887767040))<br />
Holy grasping at straws, Batman!<br />
I disagree. It feels like the argument is &quot;questing should be super fast and easy on alts.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403607823885430784))<br />
But alts are meant to be played. If you just want more max level dudes, there are better solutions. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403608036205268992))<br />
<br />
It IS a difference because then there's a lore reason, which is what people are asking for. Inability to mount is more boring.<br />
I don't think many of the pro flight crowd would be swayed with a lore explanation alone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403608329781383168))<br />
Is there a good reason NOT to back up the gameplay decision with a plausible lore explanation and story?<br />
Not at all. If there is a good lore reason, that's better. But lack of good lore should not bad gameplay go through. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403643460416061440))<br />
<br />
Did you ever think about something like a 10 second cast time for flying mount summons? Or a 30 sec cooldown?<br />
Yeah, we've tried those and also things like slow turning radii, etc. Haven't found a solution we think feels good yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403640259134496769))<br />
<br />
Stand your ground GC. There are those of us who know flying was worst thing to happen to game.<br />
That's not our stance though. Flying feels awesome, is convenient, fast and a great reward. The problem is one of timing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403639227138580480))<br />
<br />
Maybe because people want faster, but not instant, Mr. False Dichotomy.<br />
Speeding up XP per quest would make it faster. Flying lets you ignore most of it. Faster is fine. Hollow, less so. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403638908396646400))<br />
<br />
It seems like you're getting less good at giving reasons and better at excuses.<br />
Imagine we let you fly in dungeons and raids. Do you think they would be as fun as they are today? That's really our reason. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403638443260919808))<br />
<br />
So, do you also hate the way Rogues play the game? Sneak in, unlock prison cage, sneak away...?<br />
I don't think you can really compare the benefits of stealth to flying. Besides it's a bonus to only 2 classes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403610520864841728))<br />
I understand. Just don't get what you mean by &quot;trivial&quot; then. I always thought flying made questing more fun.<br />
Twitter shorthand to some extent, but you probably fight 4x fewer creatures when you can fly to avoid them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403636223836553217))<br />
<br />
It would be nice if flying was a risk vs reward decision. Swarms of Monstrous Kaliri? No fel canons yet tho D:<br />
It would have to be very dangerous to overcome the benefits of flight. Kaliri didn't keep me grounded. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403609430249332736))<br />
<br />
About no-flying stuff in Warlods, do you guys ever though about gatherers? I cannot imagine myself running for plants on foot<br />
That's one reason why we wouldn't outlaw flying forever. But at one point you did all your gathering on the ground. It can be done. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403318866165526528))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
not just that, but even 1 makes healing less fun. Spamming aoe heals is another problem.<br />
Spamming AEs, especially smart heals, does make healing less fun in our minds. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403644586259542016))<br />
<br />
That sounds pretty awesome to me, honestly. Prot might be sad to lose a dps CD though.<br />
It might be fine for Prot to have an offensive and defensive CD. Depends on the whole package. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403643276709748736))<br />
<br />
Most important stat? I cant get rid of ENOUGH Spirit as a healer ;P<br />
To be fair, some healer specs (esp. Mistweaver) don't value Spirit enough. We intend to fix for 6.0. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403637806515240961))<br />
<br />
1 burst cd is enough per spec<br />
I don't know that it would be a hard and fast rule, but if you always macro your CDs together, why have different CDs? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403633188863365120))<br />
<br />
will changes to vengeance in dreanor protection more viable in trial of gladiator arenas but less annoying without high ap?<br />
Maybe. It's more important to have a fun and balanced trial than to have Gladiator tanks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403606438980751360))<br />
<br />
Actually everything we call 'skill' on the game is about responding to a visual/sound stimulus. Just like snapshotting<br />
It's about degrees. A mod can't reliably tell you when to use a speed boost to survive. It can solve when to redot very easily. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403604618573135873))<br />

I was curious if you were happy with the Druid split into Feral and Guardian this xpac. Did it live up to your expectations?<br />
Overall yes. It's tricky for us to determine how often a Guardian or even Balance Druid should use cat form. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403606680102895617))<br />
<br />
Guardian Druid often feels boring compared to other tanks. Are there any plans to address it?<br />
They need stronger active mitigation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403047167624888320))<br />

Please bring back the truly rare hunter pets, some of us like camping for them... effort worth the reward.<br />
What was the last truly rare one by your definition? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403634220771184640))<br />

While you're talking about healer stuff, when is the really bad priest T90 going away?<br />
We like tier 90 for priests. We can split out healing from DPS / Shadow versions in 6.0 though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403318056996192257))<br />

wasn't root break on intervene intended to give a choice for that tier? Back to safeguard being required.<br />
The value of balanced PvP has to trump the value of every talent being a fun choice. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403609103416582145))<br />
You keep using this word &quot;balanced&quot; I don't think it means what you think it means.<br />
&quot;Balance&quot; is when other players can't crush me. When I crush them, it's &quot;skill.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403636992350502913))<br />
small war. nerf needed but this is boring. Was nice to have small utility with MSR. Wars very one dimensional and<br />
What would you have liked to see instead that would have solved the problem? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403608801644802048))<br />
Disrupting Shout gone (Warriors don't need 2 interrupts), AoE reflect replaces reflect.<br />
To be fair, they would need a new talent to replace Disrupting Shout that presumably is something useful. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403642846160224256))<br />

<br />
Actually, it's more along the point that flying from mob to mob is 100x less epic/fun than being the badass who raised a whole town of Scruffy Clan Orcs looking for 15 [Scruffy Orc Ears] instead of skipping past every mob and/or pet that doesn't drop one.<br />
<br />
Also, they take loads of time making the 'Worlds' we play in: flying above the trees makes things look boring - it's just a carpet of trees and a hill here and there.

They never promised anything.<br />
<br />
The 8 Vanilla races are the priority since they are the oldest. Then we'll see the 2 TBC races afterwards.</div></div><hr />

They said BC races would come after the Vanilla races, so if they're aiming to have the Vanilla races done for the expac release. The BC races would probably be rolled out in the next major patch.</div></div><hr />

A completely subjective experience.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, they take loads of time making the 'Worlds' we play in: flying above the trees makes things look boring - it's just a carpet of trees and a hill here and there. Down in the forest, is everything that makes the world beautiful.<br />

Again, completely subjective. And a flawed argument, really.<br />

<br />
<br />
Guess which one looks more &quot;beautiful and less boring?&quot;<br />
<br />
Give you a little hint, it's not hellfire. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Skipping that is what makes most Cata zones so forgettable.<br />
<br />
Actually, I LOVED zones like Uldum because the QUESTS were ridiculously fun. Instead of having just &quot;kill 20 X for 20 Y,&quot; they actually made an effort to make the quests themselves fun and exciting. <br />
<br />
Shooting down pursuing airplanes as tail gunner to Harrison Jones? Much more fun than killing some orcs for their miscellaneous tools for the umpteenth time while running around on the ground. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Frankly, if Blizzard WERE concerned with the only problem being &quot;we don't like players hopping between mobs,&quot; then they WOULD have made efforts to curtail this by doing things like adding cooldowns to flying mounts after dismounting, or somesuch. That's a VERY easy solution that both lets people actually USE their flying mounts, travel efficiently, avoid extremely extraneous mobs, AND prevents them from hopping between quest mobs.<br />
<br />
But they're just caving to whiners. I don't feel &quot;It just didn't feel right&quot; is a valid point. Frankly, I'd rather have SOME form of flying than NONE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What he's saying is they're trying to get them all done for the release of the expansion, but they may not all be ready by then. They're all going to be done, it's just a matter of when. If they aren't all done, they'll release what ones are ready. Just be glad they aren't going to half-ass something just to have it ready for the expansion release. Get it right, then release it.<br />

<br />
Did you play Storm Peaks when it was current content? They gave you ways of getting around when you needed to without having a flying mount. They can do things like that instead of just enabling flying in every zone from the word go.</div></div><hr />

This is sad because it feels like a filler expansion, we travel back in time, meet some ppl, kill some orcs, and that's it, nothing relevant..It would be much more interesting if this &quot;rift of time&quot; that Garrosh opens bring some consequences in the present and, in the end we must shut down the Red Portal because it became instable, during this events some character from the past may end up crossing the portal before it destruction...I don't know...<br />
<br />
It would be great to see Nerzul interacting with the helm of the Lich King or something like that...</div></div><hr />

In BC we went to a dead world to stop a bad guy from our world bringing stuff back and murdering us.<br />
In Wrath we went north to stop a bad guy bringing stuff back and murdering us.<br />
In Cata we ran around places that got messed up to stop a bad guy murdering us.<br />

Well, each expansion changed Azeroth and the actual state of the lore, the way they said &quot;Time travel is just a means to get players back to Draenor and bring back the classic Warcraft feeling and characters&quot; just feels like that all they want is a excuse to show us some old characters and then at the end of the expansion bring us back to Azeroth as if nothing had happened...I hope I'm wrong, like I said, it would be awesome if this &quot;trip&quot; to Draenor change something in the actual state of the lore..</div></div><hr />

I though it wasn't a time travel expansion.<br />
<br />
Everyone seems to be missing what they meant by that quote. They didn't mean &quot;There's no time travel happening&quot; because there very obviously is to start the chain of events. What they meant is that we won't be dealing with time parodoxes or altering our timeline, there's no Back to the Future plot going on where we have to stop Garrosh from marrying our mom as we slowly fade from existence.<br />
<br />
This doesn't mean there's no repercussion's on the real timeline though, because Iron Horde invading Azeroth and us going back and forth will have an influence on Present Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, they take loads of time making the 'Worlds' we play in: flying above the trees makes things look boring - it's just a carpet of trees and a hill here and there. Down in the forest, is everything that makes the world beautiful. Skipping that is what makes most Cata zones so forgettable.<br />

You mean like how we can ride our ground mounts in dungeons / raids now?<br />
<br />
Every time he / they makes an excuse/response, its some ridiculous analogy that has no context or back-peddles on the precedence they've put out already.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can we have an orange colored version of this shirt?&quot;<br />
&quot;Why dont we just make all new characters lvl 100 then.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;But youll fly over the raid trash&quot; <br />
&quot;um...we cant even ride through them on ground mounts...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alts arnt meant to be faster the second time around&quot;<br />
&quot;Didnt you put in an account wide token that gives you 2x rep for alts?&quot;<br />
&quot;Cant we mail gold to an alt so they can buy faster ground/flying speed instead of having to farm the gold themselves?&quot;<br />
&quot;And on that matter, cant we just mail a LOT of stuff to alts to help speed things up?&quot;<br />
&quot;BoA gear&quot;<br />
&quot;If garrisons end up being per character, there will likely be a way to make garrison leveling and improvements faster on an alt.<br />

I think the relevant line is this: &quot;This will let the story have some fun elements that involve characters from the present without changing the timeline.&quot;<br />
Sure, maybe since we are successful nothing spills into Azeroth and the world is relatively the same, but the characters who go with us see some shit and they are changed forever. Maybe Thrall meets his father and understands him better and learns that while he wants to be a family man he must fight for the world like the old days for his son. Maybe Anduin sees some shit and becomes a true horde sympathizer. Maybe Some other Alliance leaders get some screen time. The idea is that while nothing from that world spills into Azeroth the events of the world will affect these characters going forward and develop them. That is what we will take away from the expac and that is fine. (Which, by the way, is what we got out of Mists. Anduin, Wrathion, Garrosh, and Vol'jin all went through pretty big changes. I expect Anduin's involvement with Wrathion to ultimately pay off for better or for worse.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Look no further, it's timeless island.. imagine if you could fly to a rare while some others couldn't. That content will be obsolete at 6.1 when level 100 will have a new dynamic zone which probably won't allow flying either.<br />

Those things you said, you honestly believe Blizzard can't find a way to make that possible without taking away flying? Blizzard should reward players who WANT to be on the ground, should reward those who WANT to explore. I am in total agreement that no flying while leveling makes sense. What about level 100? How would they make ALL the leveling zones epic and awsome for max level characters AND leveling characters. Timeless Isle works because it is small AND all the mobs are elites and can be difficult for a lot of players. You can't do that with every zone. They said flying trivializes content. So does being able to kill 4-5 normal mobs at a time without too much problem. Not once have I died leveling in MoP. If they want to make ground more interesting, have all the mobs elite with 20-30 giants in each zone. That will certainly spice things up and won't make ground content trivial even at max for awhile. What they should do is allow flying in the leveling up areas when you reach 100 and have the max level areas no flying.</div></div><hr />

Imagine we let you fly in dungeons and raids. Do you think they would be as fun as they are today? That's really our reason. (Source)<br />
<br />
Talk about lame excuses to give for an answer. Completely went off on a tangent with some nonsensical bullshit answer. WTF is flying in dungeons/raids got to do with flying in WoD.<br />
<br />
I really wonder if they actually thought about removing flying completely from the game?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocee9d117667</div><div class="date">2013-11-25, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's obvious why we won't have flying mounts, and they will never say the right answer.. if we had them at level 100, all the level 100 would flight through the air killing all the rare spawning when people are leveling around and can't do the same because there will be 15 mobs between them and the rare.<br />
<br />
Look no further, it's timeless island.. imagine if you could fly to a rare while some others couldn't. That content will be obsolete at 6.1 when level 100 will have a new dynamic zone which probably won't allow flying either.<br />
<br />
I think it's a stupid idea personalty, but we'll see how it goes.<br />
<br />
I bet they will even spice things up with another elite charging your sorry ass till you're dead. <br />
<br />
Then you'll run to your corpse, up a mountain, on ground, as a ghost. <br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Also, i think there's a funny thing regarding this whole no flying discussion that people seem oblivious to.<br />
You could go 100% just ground mount as is right now.<br />
<br />
If it's so bloody awesome, you'd do it. But you don't, do you. You sit on a throne of hipocrisy talking about how awesome shit would be<br />
yet you fly yourselves because it's convinient.<br />
<br />
It's sorta like Vanilla discussion. But stuff was so awesome back then! We could do X/Y/Z.<br />
<br />
Then in a single fel swoop, akin to one hell of a hangover, all the bad comes back to you.<br />
And then ya'll go silent as the grave or become the whiners - cuz guess what, ya wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lies.<br />
<br />
Howling Fjord is the best looking zone in game.<br />
<br />
Deepholm is just a dank pit with few glowing bits.<br />
<br />
But it's all subject I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, they take loads of time making the 'Worlds' we play in: flying above the trees makes things look boring - it's just a carpet of trees and a hill here and there. Down in the forest, is everything that makes the world beautiful. Skipping that is what makes most Cata zones so forgettable.<br />
<br />
Yeah, which is cool the first time you do it. Is it still cool the third? The fourth? The eighth?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. I'd even go so far as to say I'm finding playing through zones dull by the 2nd time.<br />
<br />
I take my time when I level my main. Never rush it, I follow the storylines and enjoy it. After that I couldn't care less and want to get through it as quickly as possible. Which is why I would love a Wrath style flying-tome.<br />
<br />
I may not even bother with alts in WoD anyway, if they continue with the grindy &quot;catch up&quot; systems.</div></div><hr />

As of patch 5.3 you can buy the Scroll of Resurrection gear sets from Iris Moondreamer &lt;Quartermaster&gt; in Mount Hyjal and Erunak Stonespeaker &lt;The Earthen Ring&gt; in Vashj'ir.</div></div><hr />

You won't be seeing people flying a day or 2 after the xpac comes out, going for the nodes you're fighting for. People may actually feel compelled to look around and enjoy the scenery, besides the fools that go for realm firsts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
try 2-3 months. then have &quot;fun&quot; trying to level alts. <br />
<br />
prediction: ghostcrawler will backtrack on this once the quarterly report comes out and they see sub numbers tank for a new expansion. This sort of thing already happened with MOP dailies.</div></div><hr />
