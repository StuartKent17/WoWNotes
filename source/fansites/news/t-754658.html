Cataclysm Beta - Build 12857 (Codename Ninja)<br />
A new beta build has been deploye... Actually, no, a new build appeared out of nowhere and was never deployed on beta servers. I have absolutely no idea why, but, hey, it's still a beta build! <br />
<br />
Disclaimer - This build is NOT ON BETA SERVERS, I have no way to confirm strange values by checking in-game and a lot of temporary stuff might be there. I strongly suggest that you don't even try to complain about changes in this build on official forums, and if you plan to do it, you'd better do it in a very nice and constructive way if you don't want to get your ass kicked. <br />
Disclaimer #2 - Most of the tooltips don't work for the moment. Working on it.<br />

I highly doubt Blizzard is done adding achievements beings cata is still in beta and all.

Yep, it is.<br />
We do not plan to patch today, though we plan to have a great deal of new content in the upcoming patch. You'll get access to new zones and dungeons, and potentially an increase in level cap to 85.<br />
<br />
I'll check in on the issue with goblins. I know it's a high priority and I'd like to play mine again as well -- which should make very high priority. ;p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Achievements are something that you can earn and are unique to your character.<br />

Guild achievements are achievements which are earned by your guild as a group of people and are stored within a new 'Guild achievements' tab of your Achievement panel.</div></div><hr />

Nope, you can check the models easily in model viewer. It's just that this build was grabbed directly from the Blizzard servers, meaning that Blizzard uploaded in to their file server and didn't redirect the patcher to the file (aka they didn't intend to release it today). Boub was likely checking the file servers, was like &quot;WTF IS THIS?! an unreleased patch?!&quot; and downloaded the file.<br />

<br />
Well, it's not on the blizzard torrent announce (http://us.tracker.worldofwarcraft.com:3724/announce) or it would have been picked up by the patcher. They follow a standard naming scheme with their patches (WoW-4.0.0.12857-x86-Win-enUS.torrent or .MPQ, etc) so I'd imagine it wouldn't be too difficult to find if you looked at a previous torrent.<br />
<br />
This is of course ASSUMING the file is still even up or that Boub got it from their servers in the first place. He's very ambiguous in the first post.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finally, a altoholic achievement :&gt;<br />
<br />
Nah, this is a guild achievement. This achievement is faceroll ˆˆ<br />
<br />
But the ones like &quot;Classy Orc&quot; are those where alts will shine, because basically you're gonna have to lvl up to 85 all possible race/classe combination, which wont be super easy, and will require some coordination with rerolls. Or a pretty huge guild.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard never said they were removing MC and BWL. The only change to either of these instances is that BWL no longer drops elementium ore, it noe drops elementium ingots. Which get smelted into Hardened Elemntium bars instead of Elementium bars.<br />

<br />
Exorcism mana cost changed from 20% base mana (up from 8% of base mana). Cooldown removed.<br />
Denounce revamped - Reduces the mana cost of Exorcism by 25/50%. In addition, you have a 50/100% chance when casting Holy Shock to make your next Exorcism spell instant and cost no mana. <br />
Healing Light renamed to Blazing Light - Increases the damage of your Holy Shock and Exorcism by 10/20%. (No longer affects Word of Glory's healing) <br />
Conviction is back as a Holy Tier 5 talent - Gives you a 1/2/3% bonus to damage and healing for 15 sec after causing a critical effect from a weapon swing, spell, or ability. This effect stacks up to 3 times.<br />
<br />
...Probably jumping the gun here and putting too much faith in it, but do you think, when mixed with the first few tier Retribution talents, Blizzard's starting to give the whole 'Shockadin' thing a go and giving paladins a ranged-dps spec (like how feral druids can choose between tank or dps in one tree)? Or is it just going to be increase in dps when not healing, but not enough to be competitive with retribution paladins?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exorcism mana cost changed from 20% base mana (up from 8% of base mana). Cooldown removed.<br />
Denounce revamped - Reduces the mana cost of Exorcism by 25/50%. In addition, you have a 50/100% chance when casting Holy Shock to make your next Exorcism spell instant and cost no mana. <br />
Healing Light renamed to Blazing Light - Increases the damage of your Holy Shock and Exorcism by 10/20%. (No longer affects Word of Glory's healing) <br />
Conviction is back as a Holy Tier 5 talent - Gives you a 1/2/3% bonus to damage and healing for 15 sec after causing a critical effect from a weapon swing, spell, or ability. This effect stacks up to 3 times.<br />
<br />
...Probably jumping the gun here and putting too much faith in it, but do you think, when mixed with the first few tier Retribution talents, Blizzard's starting to give the whole 'Shockadin' thing a go and giving paladins a ranged-dps spec (like how feral druids can choose between tank or dps in one tree)? Or is it just going to be increase in dps when not healing, but not enough to be competitive with retribution paladins?<br />
<br />
well not so much a shockadin dps build so much as it is just giving holy paladins an more effective method for soloing/questing without needing a second spec to be able to kill things, all the other healers had damage spells they could use with their spellpower healing gear, holydins on the other hand only had judement, exorcism and holy shock all of which have cooldowns, it will be nice to be able to throw out exorcisms while the healing load is light in different fights</div></div><hr />

<br />
does this mean every time i crit with mf the shadowfiend cd is reduced by 20 sec? so after 8-10 crits with mf i can reuse shadowfiend ? Oo</div></div><hr />

We'll have to see I suppose, but if they keep the whole 'guaranteed crit strike against undead and demons' element (not that it's likely there'll be a load of undead/demon fights in Cataclysm of course), plus coupled with Inquisition....could be interesting...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll once again bite my tongue til cataclysm, but the bosses better be doling out damage slower because a heroic LK phase 2, valkyrs, defile, plague of raid health munching doom, and tank ouchies is just plain disastrous, and then comes phase 3...aha.

well, as it is on live it's HORRIBLY OP in every sence. You NEVEr go oom as a warlock even if you are focused.

# Totemic Vigor is gone.<br />
# Improved Fire Nova is now a Tier 4 Enhancement Talent - Increases the damage done by your Fire Nova by 10/20% and reduces the cooldown by 2/4 sec.<br />
<br />
So basically, they take away what was going to be an AMAZING PvP talent, and instead give us a subpar talent that is meant for trash AoE? No one is going to put points into improved fire nova because:<br />
<br />
a) the spot its in wasn't used for pts for a PvE build anyway<br />

Totemic Vigor is a complete joke. That talent absolutely should be baseline and frankly I wouldn't be surprised if it is now a baseline ability for all three specs. I think it is a bit of a stretch to call Vigor an amazing talent though.<br />
<br />
The magma totem concerns are legit though. Maybe they are changing Fire Nova to be usable with Searing as well as Magma. If not, this is going to be a situational AOE talent that everyone is going to skip just like everyone in Elemental skipped it when it existed there in beta.</div></div><hr />

Ah i see. I read it wrong. It isn't the heal effect on the HOT being reduced; it is the time/duration of the HOT being reduced. so if the HOT effect heals for the same amount but in a shorter time, then sure, it is a buff to regrowth.</div></div><hr />

How in jokerjesus name do you figure that?<br />
<br />
They reduced the length of the hot and reduced the amount of the hot(which wasn't that high to begin with) and as long as it still costs an arm and a leg to cast no point in ever using a regrowth.<br />

<br />
I was expecting a Divine Plea nerf since they first announced they were reworking mana regen, but this was much more than I expected. It will be almost useless if there is still a 50% healing debuff on it after this.<br />
<br />
I'm liking the LoH change since that's about the cooldown Holy had anyway with talents and the glyph.<br />
<br />
Tower of Radiance change is nice, and it makes up for the Blessed Life change since Blessed Life won't give Holy Power in PvE anymore.<br />
<br />
Illumination just makes me sad... First it was 100%, then 60%, then 30%, and now it's gone.<br />
<br />
Arbiter of the Light change is weird. I know it's a tier 1 talent, but it's a Holy talent that doesn't affect any Holy spells. Odd.<br />
<br />
Conviction in Holy... I like it and I was taking it in Ret anyway in my cata Holy spec but it just doesn't feel right as Holy.<br />
<br />
Daybreak is just a nice talent.<br />
<br />
Prot and Ret don't have many interesting changes, they just appear to be a majority of buffs or logical changes.<br />
<br />
Overall... it looks like Holy just lost a majority of its mana regen. All that's left is regen from Spirit, the now minor regen from Divine Plea, and whatever raid buffs you get. I guess we'll have to see how this turns out.</div></div><hr />

Base damage, which means they want the AOE to not suck when you need it most. Its going to be a mix, some pulls will require CC some AOE. As it should be. More variety = more fun.</div></div><hr />

This is very true, the internal stuff is done for balances and playing with numbers. Mark my words before the 2nd week of October 4.X.X will be live on all servers.

To me wow is all about ingame goals, you find somthing that you want to work towards be it pvp pve achievements or all of the above, and while getting to your goal you find new goals/content that you want to beat/achieve,thus the content branches out and becomes huge.<br />
The equip recuirement is an unnessecary narrowing of the games content by depriving some classes the ability to optaining theese feats.<br />
<br />
Note I ask not for the Ateish valànyr or shadowmourne quests to be doable by all classes alltho at some point in cata that might be an idea for luring players back into theese awsome dungeons, and by doing so letting new players experience Ulduar and ICC by joining one of theese farm raids as a grunt or leading one themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Little nitpick, but Consecration got nerfed, not buffed. Open question: was Consecration really OP or something? I do agree that the AE buffs though do seem a little out of place considering how hard they've been pushing the whole, &quot;You won't AE your way through Cata,&quot; argument.<br />
<br />
In general the Paladin changes really make me sad, but I haven't been too happy with a most of the changes they've been making to Paladins, so it's really not surprising ... Most of the other stuff looks promising (or in the case of some class changes, I don't know enough to make up my mind :P), but I am less and less excited about taking my Paladin main from 80-85 all the time.<br />

Healers are going to be about healing intelligently not constantly, you're gonna have free GCDs in cata, this is where you throw in some damage spells which through talents somehow benefit your healing or mana regen, paladins are probably the best off in terms of mana regen with the seal of truth that gives you mana back just for beating on an enemy with your weapon in addition to their blessing of might. They want to get healers more involved in the combat, I know how it is, I'm usually staring at my healbot window making sure everyone is being kept alive and only occasionally glancing at the fight to make sure I'm not standing in fire or something.</div></div><hr />

Given that Deadmines and SFK are recycled, does this list mean that there will only be 7 new 5-mans in Cataclysm? Sounds a little low to me.</div></div><hr />

I could be wrong but I am pretty sure that is supposed to be classes not races, I am fairly certain there is only one orc or goblin race. At least it regards to honorable kills.</div></div><hr />

Seems to me that Blzzard are deliberately delaying the release of the Cataclysm module in order to generate more hype and hysteria amongst the WoW fanatics. (thats us M8s)so when release day comes eveyone will anxiously line up with money in hand to buy there copy.</div></div><hr />
