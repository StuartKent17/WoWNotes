Season 8 - Paladin Armor Set 
At first, Blizzard posted the Season 8 Armor for the paladin instead of the tier 10 ... So I guess we can finally preview one of the Season 8 Armor Set!

<br />
we apolegize for the late T10 shaman set. Since we were focusing on other classes, so the shaman set would be introduced a bit later. Although we noticed we raised the expectations of the few shamans that still exist. For that we are making a new set for the shamans, so they reach the expectations. Ofcourse the T10-shaman set textures will be delayed. (around patch 4.1 we will introduce the new T10 textures.) Meanwhile the 10set textures wiill be replaced by an aboriginal lioncloth. And for the epic feeling the lioncloth will glow when you got the full set.<br />
Thank you for your patience.<br />

Ok, it's not that bad, I actually enjoyed the T8 once you got used to it, but let's really hope the &quot;5th piece&quot; of the set, which we always have to replace by something else because it's not BiS once you get 4 pieces (Legplates of Ascension this tier) will fit with that.<br />

Other than that, that's warlock colors..<br />

I personally am not opposed to the idea of having a kilt on pally tier but at least have it look remotely like it's a plate item. I think they managed to do fairly well on T2 and ok on T8 but honestly if they didn't tell me it was pally tier i could see a druid, shaman, or clothy having that graphic before a pally.</div></div><hr />

Everywhere I hear you guys complaining how blizzard puts skulls everywhere and paladin doesn't look like a holy warrior and...<br />
OH MY FUCKING LORD I WOULD KILL A GUY (or two) FOR S8! It looks so awesome paladin-like. I want it :( too sad I'm a bad player and suck at pvp..hope it will be available for emblems sometime...when no one wants it for the stats anymore.<br />
I hope they keep this style for paladin sets. It looks holy. It looks awesome. I would finally feel like a paladin in this set. I think you should roll a death knight or rogue if you have problem with bright colors. We are not darkadins. We are holy warriors of the light! We have to shine like this.<br />
I looooove S8..and I hope there will be a white/silver version of T10 too (there are currently only 3 colors where other classes usually have 4).<br />
Oh god...a white/gold paladin set..I never thought I would live long enough to see this happen. Designers did a great job there making it look like a paladin.</div></div><hr />

It's called a kilt...and part of a culture you fail to understand, I see. It may look &quot;gay&quot; to you but for some it's tradition and seen in a fashionable way.</div></div><hr />

I played a paladin for 4 1/2 years. I also have quite a decent amount of friends that play them. Kilt rocked on T2, it's terrible on everything else. I don't know 1 single paladin that I play with that liked the T8 pants.</div></div><hr />

Well, hey, season 8 looks nice. Tier 10 paladin though, they keep showing the blue one, are the green and red ones still having that bugged helmet?<br />

You must admit that Tier 8, while trying to revive the kilt design, looked like it was nothing more than a robe. It appears Tier 10 has the same design, but the skin shows armor plating, much like Tier 2.</div></div><hr />

I get that they are trying to make paladins look like they are in the crusades or something with these kilts/dresses but the sub par graphics engine only seems to let them change the texture of the bottom of a robe and slap it over pants. While wearing a tabard all it does it somehow tuck the tabard into the bottom of the robe and doesn't display the bottom half of the tabard. Looks like you are wearing a t-shirt ffs.<br />
<br />
I personally don't like the look of the kilt. In my T9 I look like im wearing armor. As a tank I should be wearing heavy armor. These sets with the kilt I look like some sort of caster class. Plus I had to hear the same lame ass jokes from everyone on my server/guild regarding the &quot;dress&quot; I was wearing for months when I had my Tier 8. I don't feel like going through a repeat of that.<br />
<br />
My main question is which piece gives the robe look, is it the pants that are actually the bottom of a robe or is it chest that is just extended down over pants cause I need to decide which one to skip and hope there is a suitable stat replacement for either.</div></div><hr />

Very nice catch! I did think the paladin set looked more molten-- if it was paladin it would make no sense because it's not lavaman, it's plagueman. Hm... but the name of the set is &quot;frost witch&quot; XD so I was hoping for something like that outfit you get for the polar bear dailies... XD</div></div><hr />

What you just said does not make any sense. Of course they wear underwear. However the damn skirt is what the tier is, not the supposed plate undergarments you made up. Bliz is putting the stats on the skirt. The slot for legs is a skirt, not some plate you can't see. <br />
<br />
For the love of God please stop witht he skirts. And while your at it, stop woith the flaming skull helm which looks like a DK helm. Flaming skulls is not a paladin theme at all. We are NOT dks and paladins do NOT wear skirts.</div></div><hr />

Plate kilts/skirts are used in quite a lot of fantasy-based games. The idea in other games has been the metal was elven made and therefore much lighter than steel or iron, and very flexible for maximum ease of motion. I think WoW basically went with that idea, but of course couldn't restrict it to just any elven race and so every pally race gets the kilt. Besides, it looks great. :D <br />
<br />
And the skull thing I believe represents that this final fight against Arthas is going to be no holds barred, more of a vengeance-like idealism where the paladin isn't represented as so good and pure. More determined and gritty, ready to do whatever it takes to kill the Lich King. That kind of thing. Not to mention all our t10 gear was supposed to be made to represent the Lich King's army/minions in some way. Skulls is probably fairly appropriate.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ksaf</div><div class="date">2009-11-07, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think the flaming skulls have something to do with lavaman/bolvar...<br />
edit: and its not a skirt, its a robe underneath the plate armor (though they could make the plate part - chest, shoulders, helmet and gloves - look more like something actualy made of plate).but i like that kind of look, kinda like a warrior priest from warhammer.<br />

<br />
<br />
Before it was announced as a Paladin set, I was really hoping it would be a Shaman set! <br />
And tbqh, I'de MUCH rather use the Paladin Arena gear item model set as our T10 =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard was all like: <br />
What does the Paladin represent?....<br />
-The Holy Light ofc!<br />
-Oh. That's true, they should really have that &quot;Holy Champion-look&quot; then.<br />
-Yeah!....So let's make 'em look like shamans then! <br />
-Yeah! Best plan ever!<br />
<br />
And that's how it happened. <br />
(Btw. Shamans will be getting white, shining plate armor which has golden &quot;Tyrael&quot; wings on the back to enhance their aura of Elemental power which is the Shaman's trademark)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My only concern is if the Ret set boots will actually match for a change.<br />
3 Seasons of sharing a model with another class is lame.</div></div><hr />
