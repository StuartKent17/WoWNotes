Patch 5.4 - Siege of Orgrimmar Stormwind Harbor<br />
A damaged version of the Stormwind Harbor area exists in the Patch 5.4 PTR files. This is not located in the regular world, just in the Siege of Orgrimmar encounter. <br />
<br />
During the Garrosh encounter in Siege of Orgrimmar, players are teleported to a modified section of Temple of Jade Serpent, Terrace of Endless Spring, and Temple of the Red Crane. Each area has a sha spell surrounding part, preventing you from leaving it. This version of the Stormwind Harbor has a similar spell, along with the Fire Unstable Iron Star (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/147047-fire-unstable-iron-star) and Bombardment (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/147088-bombardment) spells. These point to the area being used at some point during the Garrosh encounter. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this is just speculation and nothing is confirmed, a point which Zarhym stressed in the blue post below!<br />

<br />
Hello, Alliance.<br />
<br />
Howdy, Horde.<br />
<br />
Understandably, there's a lot of rampant speculation about a version of Stormwind Harbor that has been found in the 5.4 PTR files with virtually no context behind what's going on in that environment, or where, how, and why it could be in the game. That should be relative to the time you spend drawing conclusions about what you know so far of this alternate Stormwind Harbor environment.<br />
<br />
Food for thought! Happy Friday.<br />
<br />
That sure was a lot of words that didn't mean anything. If you actually think that a contentless blue post is going to decrease the rampant speculation instead of increasing it, you're completely wrong. <br />
My goal wasn't to stop people from speculating. I'm just saying that drawing a conclusion from what you know about this alternate version of Stormwind Harbor -- hidden somewhere in the 5.4 PTR files -- and using that to fuel the narrative that we don't care about the Alliance isn't very productive.<br />

Patch 5.4 Change to RPPM Mechanics<br />
There are some further changes to the RPPM system in development that we'd like to share with you. As you know, RPPM is something we've been doing a lot of iteration on, and we have another iteration that should be hitting the PTR soon:<br />
<br />
As you may know, RPPM proc rates typically scale with haste. This was done because historically, attacking faster meant you had more chances to proc something, so got more procs, and we wanted to preserve that effect. However, most procs before RPPM were such that either their effect didn't also scale with haste, or their proc rate was predominantly limited by an ICD. Many of our RPPM effects thus far have had neither of these limitations, such that they effectively 'double-dipped' on haste, benefiting twice from it. In some extreme cases, the proc was designed such that they actually triple-dipped.<br />
<br />
As RPPM effects have become more wide-spread and more impactful, this has caused a variety of problems. Primarily, it has skewed stat balances toward haste rather significantly. It's also a compounding problem where many of these procs stack multiplicatively with each other, causing insane burst when all of these procs go off together. That can be fun, but also raises the skill cap on your performance, and makes gearing choices more restricted to ones which stack together optimally. <br />
<br />
For 5.4 we're going to change both new and existing RPPM procs to not double-dip on haste. Benefiting once from haste is fine and expected, but not twice. For example, suppose you have two hypothetical procs, Flamekissed and Villainy:<br />
Flamekissed's proc rate scales with haste, and its effect says &quot;Chance on hit: Deal 500 additional fire damage&quot;. This is fine, because only the proc rate scales with haste; the effect doesn't. Villainy's proc rate also scales with haste, and its effect says &quot;Chance on hit: +5000 Agility for 20sec.&quot; This is not fine, because both the proc rate and the proc effect scale with haste. The more haste you have, the more attacks you do in that 20sec period which benefit from the increased Agility.<br />
<br />
If both the rate and effect of a proc scale with haste, we're going to remove the haste scaling from its proc rate. In these cases, we'll compensate for an expected amount of haste by increasing the base proc rate. For any procs whose effect does not scale with haste, their proc rate will continue to scale with haste as before. However, we're also revisiting the proc rate tuning on all existing procs that were made overbudget due to the addition of Unlucky Streak Prevention (which ends up increasing effective proc rate by 9%). These changes should bring RPPM procs back to being on-budget and tied with traditional ICD procs in value.<br />
<br />
This will obviously have a noticeable effect on most players performance; don't panic. We're going to be adjusting damage/healing/tanking performance with these changes in mind. <br />
<br />
These RPPM changes should make it to PTR soon, and you'll be able to find the exact changes to each such effect there. We now show RPPM proc rates in the tooltip of the effect, which should make it easy to find.<br />
<br />
Lore is the change in post #256 happening concurrently with the change to essentially prevent procs on boss pulls? While I'm glad to see haste being so ridiculous, I still hate the idea that 2 minute CDs could have to be held for 90 seconds to match up with procs. <br />
We're still planning on making that change as well, yes.<br />
<br />
However, we recognize that not everyone likes the RPPM gameplay, and are going to greater lengths to provide alternative options in Siege of Orgrimmar. In addition to RPPM-based trinkets, there will be trinkets that use the older internal cooldown (ICD) method, as well as a few on-use trinkets if you'd prefer to have an even greater degree of control over when your trinkets are active. There's even a couple trinkets with completely passive effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
RPPM Haste Change Table<br />
&quot;Budget&quot; in the below table is defined as- accounting for the item budget difference between a standard ilvl and the ilvl of the item in question. The standard ilvl for Throne of Thunder trinkets is 528. The standard ilvl for the legendary cloak is 600.<br />

Personal Loot in Dungeons<br />
We are looking to bring the personal loot system that's currently used in LFR to dungeons as well, which will of course solve that problem. Randomly matching players together just doesn't match well with coordination and universal agreements over loot distribution. No announcements yet on when that will be coming, but it won't make it for 5.4.<br />
<br />
Also, low level gear does not matter too much because there is no ilvl requirement for dungeons until you reach Cata content.<br />
It wouldn't just be for low level dungeons.<br />
<br />
Please do not add an extra element of RNG to what is already there.<br />
It'd actually be less RNG because you're not competing against an unknown element of rolls by the other players you're randomly matched with.<br />
<br />
I dislike the LFR loot system because when I kill a boss, I like seeing loot drop regardless of whether it's for me or not. I am not a fan of &quot;personal&quot; rolls and it honestly feels like a huge nerf when you put it in low level dungeons.<br />
I kind of agree with that, personally, I'd like for loot drops to still be shown for everyone but I know it's not necessarily as simple as that.<br />
<br />
Clearly the OP of this thread, as well as thousands before it, are based on the fact that a random group of strangers being matched to take on content will tend not to come to universal agreements on how loot should be distributed. Those situations do not make most people happy. This would be a change for high level progression dungeons as well, the ones where your rolls on loot can determine how quickly you progress.<br />
<br />
I'll stop here and say there aren't any specific details available to share, where it would apply, or when, but it is something we are looking at implementing and we'd appreciate any feedback on how this might impact how you want to play the game.<br />

Legendary Cloak Upgrades and Multiple Cloaks<br />
I know this is slightly off-topic, but can we turn in our cape for a new one or have the ability to choose which cape we want to make Legendary?<br />
I'm not completely sure how things are set up in the build that's going up today, but our intent is actually that you'll be able to acquire multiple Legendary cloaks, if you like. So, if you wanted, you could actually get one for both your Protection and Retribution spec.<br />
<br />
As an update, there's been a very slight change of plans. Our current thinking is to either start the Legendary cloak off at 2/2 upgraded (regardless of whether you upgraded the Epic cloak or not), or just have it set to 608 item level and disable upgrades for it. If we do decide to make one of those changes, the cloak will not be upgradable further than item level 608.<br />
<br />
Apologies for the misinformation earlier. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265646-cloak-goes-from-608-epic-to-600-legendary/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9573038013?page=2#39))<br />

I kind of agree. I’m wondering… do you guys feel that if the green “heroic” or maybe even the thunderforged tag could be transformed into something else instead? Let’s say for example… something more like Hearthstone’s golden border around the cards. Would that make those items feel more appealing and rewarding to you? Personally I imagine it would, since that gear would be much more noticeable whenever you would inspect someone.<br />
<br />
I suppose it should really work like this, the top 5-10% of iLevel gear of any single expansion should be Epic. This should be dynamic and change gear from Epic to Rare when the next tier comes out.<br />
Same goal, but a different and very interesting approach. I wonder what most would prefer…<br />
<br />
Let us hear about all your crazy ideas. Nothing is too crazy! <br />
I’m all for brainstorming on the forums, sometimes really good ideas can come up from these discussions, and devs do pay quite a lot of attention to feedback and suggestions, so you never know…<br />
<br />
You did see the items I linked, right? Same level Blue is much more powerful? When I mentioned them in the last thread about this I got shot down with people saying I was an idiot as they aren't the same as they drop in different areas.<br />
I did and you have a good point, but I think that's the exception to the rule. You could say the same thing about comparing last expansion’s epic items to MoP’s greens and blues.<br />
<br />
In general, dungeon/raid items from the same expansion have a linear association between ilvl and colour. The issue is that above a certain ilvl, everything will be purple, which ends up making purple more “common” than blues later into an expansion since it will be much harder to find someone wearing blues than purples at that stage.<br />
<br />
*Keep in mind that there are currently no plans that I know of to change the way these tags are displayed, this is intended as merely a gathering of suggestions and feedback.

Play With the Blues – Timeless Isle<br />
You can see the new Timeless Isle quests added on the WoWDB PTR site (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/pandaria/timeless-isle?filter-build=17260).<br />
This coming Tuesday, August 6, 2013, from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. PDT, select members of the World of Warcraft Development and Community teams will be hosting a “Play With the Blues” event on the PTR! Anasterian and Broxigar will be the two realms you can choose from where you can play alongside Ghostcrawler, Bashiok, Zarhym, Nethaera, Daxxarri, Rygarius, Lore, and Crithto. The Blues will be divided among the realms, participating as both Alliance and Horde and we’re hoping you will join us as we explore the mysteries of the Timeless Isle.<br />
<br />
One of our goals is to have a lot of fun! And at the same time, we’re also hoping to receive your feedback about the island. Hidden chests, spooky caves, ghostly ships, angry rare mobs, helpful power-ups, and birds that will pluck you from your boots and take to the sky; this will be a wild event where you’re sure to walk away with some cuts and bruises. And maybe even some epic lewtz!<br />
<br />
To copy a character to the Public Test Realm, log into your Battle.net account, select World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria PTR listed in Your Game Accounts, and then click on the link that says, “PTR Character Copy”. You may also create a pre-made level 90 character of your choice. Either way, we truly hope you’ll join us and share your feedback about the new content.<br />
<br />
Many of you have already experienced some of the adventures on the Timeless Isle and there are a few updates we’d like to share with you. Listed here are some adjustments that will be implemented in time for the Play With the Blues event:<br />
<br />
<br />
Based on initial feedback, we’ve lowered the health and damage of many of the creatures on the Timeless Isle. Several avoidable mob abilities have had their damage reduced, or have been given a more obvious visual warning. Celestial abilities will no longer hit players outside of the Celestial Arena. Using the Censer of Eternal Agony will no longer make you hostile to friendly NPCs. Many new quests have been added to the Isle which are designed to tell more of its story.<br />
<br />
<br />
Come Monday, we hope we can all have a great time testing these new adjustments and many of the other features on the Timeless Isle together. And of course, your feedback is important, so please feel free to post it in the PTR Discussion forum.<br />

No, this is a place you visit during the Garrosh encounter as Horde, It might be one of the special faces for Heroic since Horde didnt visist it in the normal version but other places. Whie Alliance to go places like Temple of the jade serpent, Terrace of endless spring and some more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard told us we'd get more loot with the new system in LFR because we wouldn't be competing against other players for gear. Wrong! Other players were greedy and needed on items to sell to a vendor just because they could. I want a loot system that rewards me as much as a Normal or Heroic raid group would. I gear up a LOT faster when I'm running with my guild in Normal modes than I ever would in LFR (which can sometimes take the ENTIRE tier to get one item, and even then, I may never see it). Sometimes I gear up in two to three weeks. I enjoy having a character that is more powerful more quickly. THAT is the kind of drop rate I want to see. If that isn't implemented, players are going to be pissed and LEAVE. <br />
<br />
I'm going to say it right now. If I can't gear up my alts in dungeons as fast as I can now (and seriously, I can do that in a day or two if I'm dedicated to it), then I WILL quit this game. THAT right there is my breaking point. Not seeing loot often enough is going to ruin this game for a LOT of players because that's what we strive for. You know what happens when a dog isn't rewarded often enough for sitting when he's told? He stops doing it! Same concept. If you don't reward players often enough for their hard work, they will QUIT PLAYING.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things would go a lot smoother if people actually could agree on loot, but when you have hunters rolling on strength gear, warriors rolling on agility trinkets, mages/locks rolling on blatant healing trinkets and a lot of people complaining about this stuff on a daily basis that just means we need even more hand holding. You can thank both the MS=OS people AND the MS beore OS people for years of arguments about this also.<br />
<br />
Blame our lovely community for this change; it was proven back in early LFR DS that we couldn't have nice things without people finding a way to piss off everyone else.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest positives of this kind of change: it forces the devs to label things in 5 mans (especially heroics) correctly. Something that's needed to be done for years now.</div></div><hr />

stomwind is only changed in the raid not in the &quot;real&quot; world, + how can you say that they always favor the horde? guess you have missed that the horde is on the edge of civil war? ur presious SW is just buildings that can be rebuild, the horde have much bigger problems to worry about than a few buildings.. ;)<br />

<br />
Makes no sense at all. How does this butcher any sort of &quot;living world&quot; feeling? How is this different from the old systems in regards to getting loot?<br />
<br />
Your premise implies that any boss can *ONLY* have a limited amount of loot/treasure, and beyond that, said treasure can only be something the boss can *EQUIP*?<br />
<br />
Personal loot typically provides more loot for a group overall than NbG, because of the ability to drop more than the typical 2 (10 man) - 4 (25) pieces which have to be shared across the raid. For all we know, the changes to LFD loot will allow 2 pieces to drop as opposed to 1, meaning that you technically have twice as god a chance for loot. Or maybe we can now spend tokens in LFD for additional loot.<br />
<br />
No matter what, in most circumstances it improves the chances for loot, just by removal of people who roll on stuff they shouldn't. I would rather walk away from a dungeon or raid knowing my luck was bad, than being pissed at the community for being stupid, rude, or greedy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're reducing the duration by 1/3 though(to 10 seconds), so it's still a 'buff', but not anywhere near as big as it looks at first. It'll take using preparation to get it to be 1/3 longer(20 seconds) than it's old duration, rather than using preparation to make it 2x longer(30 seconds). Still a buff, but if they plan to get rid of preparation soon(like they did for hunters), it would be a nerf. Btw, I think rogue's are already hitting 70-80% chance with evasion aren't they? That's how it used to be when I played my rogue...the base amount of dodge they get from agi ended up making them pretty high in dodge chance to begin with.<br />

Heck, I love it, I know the only real reason it's 'disliked' is because it 'looks' like it's worse than the old system. You don't 'see' loot dropping when you fail to get anything, so therefore....a lot of people think loot just never drops. Whereas in a 10-25 man you see loot dropping, even if it's something you can't use. For anyone whose had weapons and trinkets ninja-ed, which is EVEN MORE common in an LFD set up, this system is above and beyond superior.</div></div><hr />

The new loot system is miles (and I mean MILES) better than the old system.</div></div><hr />

I mean I think it should be maybe 70-80% because having 100% chance to dodge on only a 2 min cd just seems like it would make them almost invunerable for what could be the entire duel against someone.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but it's people like you who really annoy me. &quot;Hey lets just get this class changed too how I want them so I don't have to think when dueling them like ever!&quot; Seriously, it's not that hard to beat a rogue, and it's not like they can heal properly. The fight might take a little longer than most but any good and decent player will know how to actually BEAT a rogue in dueling even with that 100% dodge chance. Stop whining for nerfs and get better at &quot;pvp&quot; -_-;</div></div><hr />

I prefer the old system. I hate joining LFR week after week and having all LFR loot depend on chance.<br />
I preferred bringing a guild, and having everyone roll for loot for you....compared to the alternative (get 2 pieces off of 12 bosses, and its usually pieces you dont want/need)</div></div><hr />

Well YEAH... and there are a lot of us. Which is why this loot system was deployed in the first place. You are correct, it makes it a bit harder for you to be carried. The upside, and this is a HUGE upside, is that it completely defeats ninja looters. I am really looking forward to this change.</div></div><hr />

They did. Orgrimmar was completely rebuilt in Cataclysm because between the Scourge and Elemental invasions, most of it was razed, burned to the ground. The only difference is they didn't show the repairing, apart from the gates, but then Stormwind's harbour just magically appeared one day, so...</div></div><hr />

I imagine it would only work on groups formed via the LFD tool, not if you zoned in via the portal, just like LFR and Normal.</div></div><hr />

I kind of agree. I’m wondering… do you guys feel that if the green “heroic” or maybe even the thunderforged tag could be transformed into something else instead? Let’s say for example… something more like Hearthstone’s golden border around the cards. Would that make those items feel more appealing and rewarding to you? Personally I imagine it would, since that gear would be much more noticeable whenever you would inspect someone.<br />

You are onto something. Purple as epic color lost its epicness.</div></div><hr />

Then do normal modes, you'll have exactly what you want.<br />
<br />
I actually think the loot system should be from looting the boss, like in Diablo 3, everybody can loot the boss, instead of being put directly in your bags, would make it feel better, but in the end it's the same thing.<br />
<br />
Personally I'd love that the new system would be only available for stuff you have random people with.. if you go with 25 guildees, should be the normal loot system, or at least be able to trade it.</div></div><hr />

Each area has a sha spell surrounding part, preventing you from leaving it.<br />
<br />
I have a video that shows you these phase transitions, viewable here (fight explanation/commentary, and our best attempt): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C27FBH31hUw<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I'd love that the new system would be only available for stuff you have random people with..<br />
<br />
I agree, because I like the idea of having loot prioritization/discussion/distrubution is a major time of the &quot;team environment&quot; that the game fosters. I think there's been a major shift away from DKP/zero sum and other related loot distrubtion methods, but I'm no expert as I was kind of &quot;late to the party&quot; in terms of when I started playing this game.<br />
<br />
At this point I doubt it ever would be, but if loot ever was changed along those lines, I'd be pretty disappointed. Passing on loot not only promotes rapport among players working together to kill the bosses in the first place, but it also employs strategy in that you might get a better piece down the road if the piece that drops isn't neccessarily best-in-slot, or it may be a bigger upgrade/simply a better item (BiS for your rogue, but not for you) for somene else. It encourages people to look at resources and create upgrade/BiS lists, rather than caring a lot less because loot is completely random anyways.<br />
<br />
It needs to be random for LFR, though -- people otherwise &quot;cheat&quot; and double-roll with a friend to get their item. People also sell items in the run (rare, because it requires players from the same server, but I've seen it happen). It just isn't fun for the people involved. Random loot doesn't give the same feeling, and the system isn't perfect, but I have a hard time imagining a better alternative.</div></div><hr />
