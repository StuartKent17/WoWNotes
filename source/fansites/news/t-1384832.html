The Blizzcon schedule (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/634-Blizzcon-2013) has some interesting changes to the team working on different games, including the return of Furor to WoW.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Team<br />
<br />
Alex Afrasiabi (Furor) - He started out as a Quest Designer, then Lead Quest Designer up until WoTLK, then Lead World Designer in Cataclysm, then he disappeared after Tigole announced he was moving to another project (Titan), but he is apparently now back as Creative Director for the next expansion!<br />
Craig Amai - He was a previously a Game Designer, and is now the Lead Quest Designer for the next expansion.<br />
Dave Kosak - He was previously Lead Quest Designer, and is now the Lead Narrative Designer for the next expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heroes of the Storm Team<br />
<br />
Dustin Browder - He was Game Director for StarCraft II, and is now Game Director for Heroes of the Storm<br />
Matt Cooper - He was Game Balance Designer for StarCraft II, and is now Game Designer on Heroes of the Storm<br />
Richard Khoo - He was Game Designer on StarCraft II, and is now Senior Game Designer on Heroes of the Storm<br />
Alexander Sun - He was on the Web Team, then Game Designer on StarCraft II, and is now Senior Game Designer on Heroes of the Storm<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Domain Changed<br />
The WarlordsofDraenor.com domain we mentioned (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3499-Blizzard-Trademarks-Warlords-of-Draenor-WoW-Expansion) last week changed early this afternoon to a Forbidden error from the domain parking page previously used. <br />
<br />
It also is now pointed to an IP address that Blizzard owns. Keep in mind that anyone can purchase a domain and point it to a Blizzard IP, as those servers currently respond to requests for any domain.<br />
<br />

HOLY FUCK. I'm so hyped for this game. Being a huge fan of LoL this might actually draw me away from the game. Having an all star team developing a moba BY blizzard. I think that's pretty win.</div></div><hr />

How? SC2 was one of the best games ever made? The expansion was the top selling PC game for the past 9 months. Your opinion is outnumbered by a hefty amount of Korean gamers who live their lives to play this game. It was one of the best made RTS games in the history of man.</div></div><hr />

He was lead world designer, meaning he was behind the zones and what the world was like, as opposed to in charge of everything</div></div><hr />

Yeah it can be anyone, but that anyone must've known the name 1 month before it was revealed.</div></div><hr />

Are you sure about the bolded part? As he did the quests &amp; lore Q&amp;A together with Chris Metzen at the 2010 Blizzcon and at one point Metzen mentioned Alex Afrasiabi and his team working on the quests for cata.</div></div><hr />

As Blizzard has yet to create an individual website for an expansion and instead just use the Worldofwarcraft.com site for everything WoW, I would say that the WarlordsofDraenor.com domain is poor evidence of the next WoW expansion. Not to say that it isn't Blizzard related or even that it couldn't be the next expansion for WoW, just that based on the past, it is weak evidence.<br />
<br />
This same thing happened with MOP last year. Domain was registered just the same. Same result. People reacted to it just like they are reacting now. Come tomorrow, this will all be put to rest anyways.</div></div><hr />

This same thing happened with MOP last year. Domain was registered just the same. Same result. People reacted to it just like they are reacting now. Come tomorrow, this will all be put to rest anyways.[/QUOTE]<br />
<br />
It does make sense that Blizzard would do so before announcing so no one else could go out and buy up the domain and just sit on it forever. The ultimate way to protect themselves from those with devious intentions.</div></div><hr />

He started out as a Quest Designer, then Lead Quest Designer up until WoTLK then world designer in Cataclysm.<br />
Even if he is an elitist raider how could he have any influence on anything other than quests?</div></div><hr />

he always wrote the lore of the quests. he was lead quest designer, he just liked working on the quests specifically and so he made up a new title, gave all the &quot;world&quot; stuff to another guy and now all he does is lore. <br />

I think it's hilarious that there's been so much hoax burning previously that we now feel the need to be this careful about assumptions before an official announcement. Come on, either the expansion is WoD or there is no expansion. Seriously. The announcement is basically a few hours away and to the best of my knowledge nothing else has been trademarked, so unless they plan to announce an untrademarked expansion it's pretty safe to call it at this point. I'd love to meet the guy so dedicated to his hoax that he thinks/bothers to point at a Blizzard IP, but yeah, I think we've exercised enough caution this time around: the expansion is WoD, gg.</div></div><hr />

I always wondered how he even got that job at Blizzard. As far as I knew he had no experience designing games, he was just one of the top Everquest players and always bitched about things that were wrong with it. Same goes for Tigole.

Well, what can I see, orcs had a nice run, seems metzens given up and handed it to a generic douche who can't figure creative concepts in a game like this.<br />
<br />
Its funny, kind of like how Thrall handed leadership to garrosh and garrosh fu*ked up the horde, metzens passed creative control to kosak, and looking at how much he butchered the orcs story at in mists, we can assume the same thing here.<br />
<br />
only hope, that kosak will do such a terrible job, and the hate that comes from it, that he'll be forced to step away from having any creative control.<br />
<br />
Say what you like about metzen, at least he made orcs into a good race since wc3 came about.<br />
<br />
'Green Humans' is not, nor has it ever been, an interesting or engaging concept. Post-WOTLK Thrall epitomized everything that is wrong with the Orcs.</div></div><hr />

You mean two PLAYERS of a game who had the balls to give Sony advice it didn't want to hear? Yeah I'm frankly preferential to their return since they designed the original MMO. Blizzard has become far too much like Sony. Seeing them return is a good thing that will do much for the game. Tigole and Furor got wrongfully banned from the EQ forums for speaking their mind, much like many did during the CRZ crappola. So yes, I think they will know how to handle &quot;anonymous&quot; individuals like Xanzul perfectly well. But if they don't does it matter? The game is in it's sun setting years.<br />

If organizing crashing servers on purpose and spreading the hybrids hate on the forums is giving an advice then I find it a little immature.<br />

Not every WoW-player is firm with the complete lore. But its funny, how everyone is only &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot; now. It looks like the hype about TDB has been completely forgotten. <br />

<br />
Boub did not suggest that it was or was not registered by Blizzard. :)<br />
<br />
The update, simply, is that the domain now points to an IP address owned by Blizzard --or rather, Blizzard webspace.<br />
<br />
As Boub alludes, this is not confirmation of ownership; as you are I -or any Tom, Dick or Harry! -can do the same, that is point our domains to a Blizzard IP address.<br />
<br />
Of course, it looks highly likely that this is a move by Blizzard. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh good, I'm not the only one that remembers what a whiny EQ raider/complainer he was. He &quot;worked with&quot; the devs in EQ for a while, but as soon as he didn't get his way, he whined and ragequit EQ...

Classic: The Fordring, Darrowshire, Linkin, The Demon Whose Name We Do Not Speak, and &quot;Of Love and Family&quot; quest lines. Basically every epic questline that you remember fondly in classic.<br />
Wrath: The entire questline that culminated in The Wrathgate. The in-game cinematic where Putricide betrays everyone was his baby; he was really excited in IRC for everyone to get through that quest line and see how it ended.<br />
Cataclysm: &quot;The Day that Deathwing Came&quot; questline in Badlands, most of the Silverpine Forest re-design, Hillsbrad, The Barrens, etc...<br />
<br />
If you've paid close attention to quests in WoW, you can tell which ones Alex has written because of the dialogue; he's easily the best character/dialogue writer Blizz has had. Personally, I'm very happy if his creative goals get to span the game.</div></div><hr />
