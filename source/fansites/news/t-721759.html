Operation Gnomeregan and Echo Isles<br />
The events themselves are not currently scheduled to go live with patch 3.3.5. We're simply taking the opportunity on the PTRs to test these events while they're up and running in case we do not have another opportunity to do so before marking these events live.<br />
<br />
[...] The release of the events will be contingent upon the development of other features leading up to Cataclysm, but their release will likely not coincide directly with a patch. They're events that simply need to be &quot;turned on&quot; when we're ready. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25134703802/operation-gnomergan-echo-isles/))<br />

Put the shared diminishing returns cooldowns on tooltips in Cataclysm<br />

<br />
Class Balance in PvP (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026566623/subtletly-rogues-and-fire-mages-in-cataclysm/))<br />
This is probably going to be one of those controversial posts, but I think if you really sit down and think about it and don't post a knee-jerk reaction, you might agree that it makes a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
&quot;Balance&quot; means two different things to Arena players. For some players, the most important thing is for their favorite spec to be viable. Balance for them is all 30 specs being about equally powerful or perhaps even in about equal proportions. For other players, and I'd categorize more of the very high-end in this camp, the most important thing is for the fights themselves to feel balanced, even if that means not every spec is truly competitive. Some players might even be happy with only RMP as a viable 3s comp, so long as the matches felt like they were won by skill and not by cheesy maneuvers or dumb luck.<br />
<br />
In a perfect world, you could accomplish both goals, and we do work towards both. But at the end of the day, it is also realistic to choose one as the higher priority goal. We made a lot of effort to get more specs into PvP in Wrath, and overall we've had a lot of success there relative to past seasons. The LK seasons have been pretty diverse, though Fire and a couple of other specs still aren't there. But that also came at the expense of actual player vs. player balance, particularly in the earlier LK seasons.<br />
<br />
One of the reasons we are focusing on rated Battlegrounds for Cataclysm is they put less emphasis on the class composition of the teams and more on the coordination of the team. The fewer number of players involved, and the more the goal is centered around killing someone then accomplishing objectives, then the more important the number and power of individual tools belonging to a single spec become. Once you go to even a 10-player team, then there is a lot more flexibility and historically under-represented Arena specs can come into their own. It's easier to have synergy the larger the team size and even double up on some classes and specs rather than have so much power determined by whose crowd controls don't diminish with each other.<br />
<br />
As far as Arena balance goes, it's an interesting debate on whether it's more important that things feel really, really good for a small number of classes or more important to have a large number of classes / specs participating.<br />
<br />
Also it is just bad design to say you want to balance all 30 Specs. and not do it. Pick a philosophy, are you balancing all 30 or are you balancing based on classes, many people would rather not play a hybrid (i.e ret) and get pushed around trying to be balanced while blizzard makes up their mind on whether they are going to balance only holy or ret and holy.<br />
I wouldn't call it &quot;bad design.&quot; Just challenging. Maybe it would have been easier if WoW had been developed with 10 classes instead of the virtual 30 we have now, but that ship has sailed.<br />
<br />
We try and balance around specs first, but if we can't quite hit that, we fall back on class. It would be awesome if Fire mages were competitive with Frost mages in Arena, but failing that, at least a mage can have a Fire build for PvE and a Frost build for PvP. If on the other hand mages themselves had no viable spec, then your only choice it to roll an alt. As easy as leveling is these days, it's still not trivial. <br />
<br />
For classes with roles that essentially do the same thing, won't the one that performs better, even only if slightly always be chosen? You can buff fire PvP but if frost is only better by a slim margin it will still be the spec of choice.<br />
&quot;Performs better&quot; in a PvP context is really hard to define. It has little to do with who is highest on the damage meters. You can look at who wins the most matches, but even then I don't think you are looking at actual power as much as popularity. As soon as someone comes up with a new strategy, that popularity can shift, even if the abilities don't change at all. Skill still has a much bigger effect than class or spec in most cases. While a good player might not be able to choose any of the 30 talent trees and be as succesful, they are rarely faced with just one choice either. <br />
<br />
Can you please elaborate on where the sane controversy is over whether or not your whole player base -or- only 50% of your player base should be allowed to participate in arenas at a relatively competitive level of play? Are you proposing that half of your player base just shouldn't be able to succeed by default simply because they picked the wrong picture at the starting screen, as &quot;interesting&quot; design? <br />
To be clear, this isn't our design, but you could design the game where 5 specs are PvP specs in the same way 4 specs are PvE tanking specs. If you rolled a shaman and really, really love to tank and perhaps even rolled your shaman back when they were tanks, then you are just out of luck. If we went that route (and again we're not) then we could provide a really balanced PvP experience for those 5 specs because we could focus all of our attention on those few. There is a reason RTS games who go for massive differentiation (like StarCraft II) have only a few races, while RTS games with many sides (like the Age of Empires games I used to work on) don't go for massive differentiation.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of players out there who could care less if Balance druids or Fire mages are ever viable in PvP so long as there are some classes / specs that they can choose which will provide a really balanced, compelling, dynamic game for them. There aren't many posting in this thread, which frankly doesn't surprise me, but they are out there and their opinions count too. You can argue they are a very small minority of our player base, but they are also the ones for whom class balance discrepancies are most meaningful because their skill at the game is so refined. In the same way, we spend a lot of effort on heroic LK 25, even though very few players have the ability to experience let alone beat that encounter. That's also not to say we spend 90% of our encounter time on the Lich King and ignore the 5-player dungeons. Make sense? <br />
<br />
Raid Healing in Cataclysm (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026435563/where-s-blizzard-heading/))<br />
Specs won't single target heal the same way. They will have enough basic tools that nobody will have a massive hole in what they can cover. We don't want the Disc priest to throw up her hands when asked to tank heal, or the paladin asked to sit out when on a fight with a lot of AE healing. You need to be able to run a 10-player raid with any 2 healers (ideally 2 different healers) and be okay. You need to be able to do any 5-player content with any healer (before you over-gear it as many of you do these days). <br />
<br />
I don't think anyone here believes that Blizzard hates healers. I believe Earthmaster said it best when he said &quot;Healers want everyone to live.&quot; This is in direct conflict with Blizzard's desire to make content challenging. The easier it is for healers to keep everyone alive, the harder it is for Blizzard to develop challenging content.<br />
Yep. The rub is that some healers are only going to enjoy encounters when they can keep everyone alive pretty easily and some are only going to enjoy encounters when they really have to work at it. Those two are hard to reconcile because you're essentially trying to bring together &quot;easy&quot; vs. &quot;harder.&quot; <br />
<br />
If you are already well rounded then you have no reason to worry. I would bet that some druids have actually macro'd a castsequence for 5xrejuv + wg. Those are the ones who will have to change. That said, I am reasonably sure that we will end up favoring certain spells over others. Regardless of what GC envisions, that's almost unavoidable. What those will be remains to be seen.<br />
Yes, the players who already use all their spells will see the least change. As for the second part of your quote, sure some spells will dominate in some cases. That's okay as long as others dominate in other places. The problem now is that many druids shrug and say &quot;I'm not a tank healer,&quot; so they don't ever use their tank-healing spells. <br />
<br />
Some of the changes that we are getting that we are getting I can agree with, but minimizing proactive healing is something I don't agree with at all, and something that I think is a very bad move on their part.<br />
There is nothing wrong with proactive healing. It's challenging to use spells like Prayer of Mending for anything but. It only becomes a problem when you aren't making decisions. If you are pre-hotting or shielding folks you expect to take damage, that's great. You're actually forecasting and otherwise paying attention to what is going around you. If you are doing it to everyone just because you can or doing it at random because it doesn't matter, then that's a problem. You may not play that way today, but a lot of players do. I have done it myself on a lot of fights just to try it out and it's way too successful a strategy given the low amount of skill or even basic decision making involved. <br />

Fury in Cataclysm<br />
First off, I would avoid any discussion of glyphs at all. We haven't finalized our glyph changes, but it's safe to say that many will change and many will go away. I cautioned the folks participating in the alpha that feedback isn't terribly useful that says something like &quot;We'll never use that talent because of the glyph&quot; or &quot;We always prioritize X because of the glyph.&quot; Treat glyphs like current set bonuses. Relevant now, but perhaps not later.<br />
<br />
For Fury, we expect Whirlwind to only get used when there are multiple targets around. We run into balancing problems when warriors (and DKs and Ret paladins and anyone else) do their normal rotation on one target and just get free damage if they can manage to get a second target into the same area. Melee need to work more like (most) casters in this regard: the Shadow priest shifts to Mind Sear when there are groups rather than just getting splash damage from Mind Blast.<br />
<br />
That leaves Fury with Bloodthirst and Slam and Heroic Strike. Heroic Strike will play more of a role since it will require a GCD, but you also may not want to push it every time in low rage scenarios. So we do think Fury will need one more rotational button. The one we are messing with right now is Victory Rush. It feels pretty cool so far, but a lot of things will change with classes over the next several weeks. Not sure yet whether it works better as a proc (like Sudden Death) or something available all the time.

Whirlwind may give us splash damage from multiple mobs...but on single target...it still amounts for about 40% of the damage done. <br />

<br />
The point he was making was that Shadow *DOESN'T* work like that. Shadow doesn't get free AoE damage - it has to switch specifically to an AoE 'rotation'. That's what they want Warriors to do, rather than just get insane free damage of fights like LK.</div></div><hr />

That or buff a talent/skill we already have (victory rush maybe) instead of making a new one.<br />

<br />
Single target, HS, BT, and the skill that replaces whirlwind<br />
AOE cleave and whirlwind.<br />
<br />
That way we have our single target rotation, and our AOE rotation. which they said they were trying to work on.</div></div><hr />

Whether those spec's were OP or not (which they were) blizz just cut them out the game rather than fixed them. <br />
You can argue some ppl still use them for a specific setup, but i guarantee most of the ppl who played those spec's changed after those nerfs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course they migrated away from those specs after thier nerf, the same way they migrated to those specs when they became OP. That's all most people do in pvp, they just gravitate to whatever is easiest to play.<br />
<br />
I personally think tanks have no place in arena pvp. In BGs they serve a purpose, which is to tank drek, gaurd nodes, etc. but in arenas you're either a damage dealer or a healer or you're just taking up space. In order to make tanks &quot;work&quot; in arenas you have to give them a bunch of damage, but at the same time you can't really have someone with access to so much survivability doing that much damage. So it's a paradox. How Blizzard will fix it? I don't know, but so far tanks have been either really bad at pvp or simply too good, with no in-between.</div></div><hr />

I've tried to figure this out for ages.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Elemental Plane is a three-tiered realm. This plane created by the titans is spherical and comparatively small — about the size of a single world.<br />
<br />
It would look like any other world to an outsider — at least, when looked upon from above or on the ground:[6] one large continent surrounded by water, with a yellow sun burning above. A casual visitor, arriving on the surface, might even believe he is on an ordinary — if somewhat violent — planet.<br />
<br />
A glowing yellow orb, casting forth light and heat, hovers near the top point of the globe, acting as the &quot;sun&quot; for the entire plane.<br />
<br />
The sphere of the plane itself is curved in a curious way that tends to baffle creatures of Azeroth's reality. As befits the plane's prison function, escaping through ordinary movement is impossible. A creature attempting to move out of the sphere simply curves inexorably around, moving toward the other side. Thus, if one were to sail across the ocean in a boat, he would eventually arrive on the exact opposite side of the plane's sole continent. The land itself is slightly larger than Kalimdor, while the seas are about the same width in all directions.<br />
Regions<br />
<br />
Each kind of elemental has claimed a portion of the world as they do not tolerate each other, in total there are four distinct realms:<br />
<br />
* The domain of Air is called The Skywall. It is a layer located in the air, and sits atop the middle layer. It is home of Al'Akir the Windlord and his air elemental servants.<br />
* The middle layer supports both, the Water and Earth domains. The surface of the realm is divided almost equally between deep ocean and a gigantic continent dotted with active volcanoes.<br />
o The domain of Water is called The Abyssal Maw. Neptulon the Tidehunter controls the oceans or Water domain.<br />
+ At the point farthest from Therazane's domain floats a mile-wide shelf of solid ice known as the Frostland.<br />
o The domain of Earth is called Deepholm. It is the soil and stone of the plane's single continent, and the ground beneath the sea. It is riddled with tunnels and under the rule of Therazane the Stonemother.<br />
+ The surface of the Elemental Plane's ocean is dotted with a few small islands of rock that yet resist Neptulon's endless assault on the land. <br />
<br />
A thick layer of permanent, tunnel-ridden stone supports the earth and water on the surface.<br />
<br />
* The domain of Fire is called The Firelands. It is a third layer of Fire, located beneath the Abyssal Maw and Deepholm. It is a realm of &#64258;ame, lava and molten rock that constantly struggles to break free of its bonds. This domain was once ruled by Ragnaros, who was later freed by Dark Iron dwarves, as explained above.<br />
<br />
First time I tried to figure it out, I somehow ended up with the Sun being above the Firelands (core), Skywall being below Abyssal Maw (ocean) and Deepholm (land), which of course made no sense whatsoever to anyone.<br />
<br />
http://img85.imageshack.us/img85/5880/elementalplane.jpg<br />
<br />
I suppose that's what happens when the &quot;first layer&quot; somehow got to be the first layer next to the core, and not the outermost layer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah it's pretty much useless in most raiding environments (and very seldom used in PVP)<br />
<br />
Think I used it most when leveling up <br />
<br />
It's being redesigned. I swear. Why do people have so much trouble with this. Every time there's a blue post about &quot;we're working on redesigning X ability to replace y.&quot; Some witty &quot;class expert&quot; has to pipe up to inform the world that x ability sucks and he can't believe Blizzard thinks people use that, or would want to use that, and does anyone at Blizzard ever play this game? <br />
<br />
They're redesigning the ability. It will work differently. Will you want to use it? I don't know, they're still redesigning it. Maybe it will still suck. Maybe it will suck more. More likely, given that they have an alpha and beta in which to test the changes, it will be added to your rotation. After it has been changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Some of the changes that we are getting that we are getting I can agree with, but minimizing proactive healing is something I don't agree with at all, and something that I think is a very bad move on their part.&quot;<br />

I don't think that arenas are gonna die in Cata, Blizz wouldn't implement new arenas for free, players who battle in arena will still get some benefit from it, which is fair. <br />
<br />
Still, and I admit it's subjective, WoW PvP has and will always be BG for me, it's much more in phase with the &quot;RP&quot; aspect of the game: great battles over large fields etc. Arenas look like a sport to me.<br />
<br />
The shift to rated BG just confirms that Blizz wants to enable casual players to enjoy more of the game, get best PvP items etc. People can argue that Arenas require few matches a week, but it requires in fact much more involvement - just to find good teammates, to find synergy with players etc.<br />
<br />
Tol barad PvP + rated BG's, no doubt we're gonna feel the first WoW spirit again :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
because there well always be wining on forums and so on ...<br />
increase resilience cap and dabble resilience in pvp gear and then you have DAMAGE balance so when some one dies or loses a duel-fight-arena he doesn't full down 2shuted he falls down after he has a chance to do something and if this effect healers [making em OP] there already on GOD MODE .</div></div><hr />

you get 3 ticks pr 2 sec with mind flay and 1 tick pr 1 sec with mind blast, why even make it have a cd??? when the dps gain is so darn low and when you go above the haste cap the difference will be even bigger <br />
so yeah giving mind blast splash damage would not be so stupid</div></div><hr />

The people they should be listening to are the very high rated teams that arent there for there first time becuase there rolling some cheap and cheesey shit like double cleanse healer warr with shadowmorne. Fuck what it does to pve, who cares, all they do is pew pew boss's, as long as a tank can hold aggro, the dps class's can do some damage, and the healers keep people alive thats all the balance PVE needs, thats it, it doesnt need to get any more complicated than that, pvp however NEEDS to be balanced VERY VERY tightly with no holes.!!! for god sake make the pvp balance tight as a fucking tiger to make the game better, how hard is that to understand? why the long ass paragraph of blah blah blah, BALANCE PVP, top priority. Every class only needs one or 2 speccs, who cares about all 30 speccs, just make the ones that are pvp viable very closely balanced, fix the fucking game.</div></div><hr />

Are you fucking retarded, thats the way shitty players feel, &quot;get rid of the part that I suck at because it takes actual skill, make BG's a focus where I can hide in a big clusterfuck of people and not worry about actually knowing how to pvp&quot; thats literally what you just said. Arena's even in there broken state are the absolute best part of the game. BG's fucking suck, they get boring really fuckin fast. Quality arena play you can do for 6 hours a day and have a blast. But obviously you dont know that because your one of these little fuckers that dont understand what the fuck your talking about but seem to have a baseless opinion anyway.</div></div><hr />

No big battles are where using CC, and CC chains properly dissapear, If you are under 2500 3v3 than how are you going to make a negative comment on the amount of multitasking it requires?! A BG or huge battle is where everything that makes PVP in this game good quickly turns in 40 assholes spamming aoe's on eachother. Are you high?</div></div><hr />

From a business standpoint, would you side with 99% of your playerbase or 1%? Remember how the 1% group gets along with the 99% group, as evidenced in this post.<br />
Ideally you'd satisfy both, but it's been made pretty clear it either can't be done within WoW or they at least don't know how to do it within a realistic time frame. It doesn't help that the arena community are early teens (or act like early teens) that are extremely irritating in their behavior, personality, and general interactions with the rest of the community. Few people have empathy for such things.<br />
<br />
Personally, arena is another aspect of WoW that has absolutely nothing to do with the genre of MMORPG:<br />
Massively multiplayer? Nope.<br />
Online? Well, yeah, of course.<br />
Role-playing? God no. Random teams from random servers fight in random arenas with no spectators, for powerful weapons and armor with no story that cost a magical non-existing currency.<br />
I hate instances too, but I guess it's something MMO companies are just too addicted to at the moment.</div></div><hr />

Ah, the &quot;whats ur rating&quot; card, that never gets old. Anyway, let me steer this to be constructive, I did not outright condemn arena, i just said i hate doing it most of the time. Its a preference, sue me. Call me a casual all you damn well please but i enjoy BGs twice as often as i ever will arena. What i'm getting at is that with the advent of Rated Battlegrounds there should be an equal gear opportunity so we don't have to dip into both sections of PvP to get one sought after Piece of gear. <br />
<br />
I Loathe being forced to do arena to get the gear i need to improve, and come cata i'm hoping this finally changes to be something more progressive. Ya know, like it should've been in the first place?</div></div><hr />

You said the word 'fuck' at least six times in there.<br />
<br />
BG's may 'suck' to you after a while, but I've always found them fun. I'm not awesome at PVP, but I know how to play, and I love the idea in BG's like AV of a shitload of Horde going up against a shitload of Alliance. It's fun, to me.<br />
<br />
And that guy's 'baseless opinion' is just his opinion, why does that mean anything to you and why do you get so butthurt about it? And you clearly are, judging by your overused amount of the word 'fuck'.<br />

I hope it's something with equal damage to Whirlwind if it does....maybe something similar to the Stormstrike ability that Enhance Shamans get. At least something that allows Warriors to attack with both weapons simultaneously. Whirlwind may give us splash damage from multiple mobs...but on single target...it still amounts for about 40% of the damage done. <br />
<br />
See what happens though. <br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly, instead of doing the smart thing and just decreasing dmg on the added mobs, they just nerf our top dmg (besides spammable HS which is only through rage exploitation which is getting killed) ability and say they are reworking Victory Rush? At least give us a new move equally as damaging as WW is for single-target or I'm not gonna be happy and I'm sure every other Fury warrior will be just as unhappy as I am.</div></div><hr />
