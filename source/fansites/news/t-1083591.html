Patch 4.3.3 available on Test Realms<br />
We didn't really report earlier because of all the Mists of Pandaria craziness but the Patch 4.3.3 is now available on test realms! This is a bugfix patch and you shouldn't expect any change from it as far as we know, but it means more bugs are being fixed on live realms soon! <br />

Update to Mists Talent Calculator<br />
What are the developments for the Cat and Bear versions of Mangle/Swipe/Thrash/etc.?<br />
Several abilities for Cats and Bears are slightly different depending on Cat or Bear Form. The abilities youâ€™re seeing in the talent calculator are the base versions that show up in your spellbook. Here are some additional details about their different effects in each form:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mangle: In Cat Form, has no cooldown, costs energy, and generates a combo point. In Bear Form, generates 5 rage, and has a 6 second cooldown, which can also be reset by a proc from Lacerate and now Thrash ticks.<br />
Swipe: In Cat Form, has no cooldown, and costs energy. In Bear Form, has a 3 second cooldown, and is free.<br />
Thrash: In Cat Form, has no cooldown, and costs energy. In Bear Form, has a 6 second cooldown, and costs 15 rage.<br />
Skull Bash: Costs 15 energy or 10 rage, depending on form, and has a 15 second cooldown. The current talent calculator says that it has a 10 second cooldown, but that is a mistake. It is 15 seconds like most other interrupts are now.<br />
Stampeding Roar: Costs 30 energy or 15 rage, depending on form.<br />
Faerie Fire: Has a 6 second cooldown when used in Cat or Bear Form. <br />
<br />

Does Arcane Charge have a duration? <br />
Yes. It is currently 8 seconds. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/217569-february-15-update-to-mists-talent-calculator/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4063167954?page=52#1026))<br />

Rogue Changes <br />
This sounds like Combat Maces all over again.<br />
Your feedback is appreciated. We'll be keeping an eye on how this ability pans out, just as we will with all the upcoming changes. That said, I'm not sure that mace stun and Paralytic Poison is an apples to apples comparison.<br />
<br />
One of the things that made Mace stun so vicious is that it simply happened. You could make brief contact with an enemy and get a lucky, sometimes clutch, proc. At the time, Stormherald was floating around amongst warriors which only exacerbated the issue. That's important context for the purposes of this comparison. Sure, chance plays a role (only in that each stack has a percentage chance to proc) but I don't think it's as much of a factor with Paralytic as it was with Mace Stun.<br />
<br />
Consider that poisons are dispellable, and you need five stack of Paralytic to get a stun off. It seems reasonably likely that the Paralytic stun will have a different dynamic in PvP than Mace Stun had. If your target is dropping stacks or you aren't able to make consistent enough contact to get stacks on faster than they drop off you may have some trouble getting the stun to land. It will also introduce the dynamic of trying to 'plan' your kidney shots around your Paralytic, so you aren't overlapping stuns.<br />
<br />
Also, all of that aside, taking a talent in Mists of Pandara means that you're making trade-offs that you weren't making by taking Mace Spec in Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
On a side-note, I noticed some other, non-poison/shiv related questions in this thread. Please stay on topic guys. I know that it's tempting to jump all over the map (I've done it), but it's best to stay focused.

Diablo 3 Contests - 450 Beta Key<br />
As some of you might know I'm also in charge of Diablofans.com (http://www.diablofans.com) these days. We currently have 3 different contests running (http://www.diablofans.com/news/1091-diablofans-diablo-3-beta-key-contests-450-keys-to-win/) for a chance to win a Diablo 3 Beta Key! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Forum Posts: Once or twice a day, we will select 10 random users with good posts every day to receive beta keys.<br />
Facebook: At random times, we will post a trivia question from the Diablo universe. The first 5 people to answer correctly will receive beta keys!<br />
Twitter: Just like the Facebook contest, the 5 fastest people to answer a trivia question will receive beta keys.<br />
<br />
<br />
We also have a 4th contest that will start a little later and will require you to post a Diablo 3 character build of your choice in the contest thread on the forums. <br />
<br />
For more details check the contest thread on Diablofans (http://www.diablofans.com/news/1091-diablofans-diablo-3-beta-key-contests-450-keys-to-win/) and if you don't want to miss the questions on Facebook and Twitter feel free to follow Diablofans over there, you will have to be very fast if you want to win a key! <br />

The point of the contest is to draw attention to the sister site. It's not a charity.<br />

Serious amount of Sylvanas fanart apparently. Maybe necrophilia is on the verge of being socially acceptable, soon... when the stars are right....</div></div><hr />

Well, thats just one of the contests you dont have to enter. That leaves you two more. Dont like facebook, then use the D3 forums.<br />

Honestly there is like 3 different contests. You should be happy!</div></div><hr />

You can use the client now, but you have to take into consideration that 1) It's not officially supported by Blizzard and 2) If you're an SLI user you'll have to make a new profile in your nVidia drivers to have WoW actually use your 2nd (and 3rd, 4th ect) videocard.</div></div><hr />

If there's a large enough amount of bugs that need fixing or something like that, it's better to use the PTR to find out if the fixes come with their own bag of problems than to find out the hard way.</div></div><hr />

They failed with the PTR client marked 64 bit for the Mac. It's um.... still 32 bit (fail!)<br />

<br />
You can't always patch with a hot fix. If client side changes are needed then a patch is required.<br />
<br />
While there have been bug fix patches that haven't appeared on the PTR that does not mean you shouldn't expect a coming patch to appear on the PTR.<br />

So... are we getting better Chimera's Eyes with this patch? :/<br />
<br />
I've had a look inside the MPQ files that got pushed out to the PTR.<br />
<br />
There isn't actually any major changes to the files themselves as far as I can tell. The wow-update-base-15314.MPQ file just has placeholder files for sounds. These files are zero k in length.wow-update-enUS-15314.MPQ appears to have house keeping type files in it.<br />
<br />
First one mentioned is 189 k the other is 22 k<br />
<br />
The tools programs didn't get an update other the wow client getting a version bump.</div></div><hr />

<br />
think we got our answer in the D3 b13 patch notes about what 4.3.3 includes (at least one thing)<br />
<br />
From D3 beta 13:<br />
&quot;Cross-game support has been added! You can now chat with Real ID friends playing the World of Warcraft PTR or StarCraft II PTR, as well as view their in-game status and current broadcasts&quot;<br />
<br />
I bet 4.3.3 recognizes D3 now across realID. Granted it's only gonna recognize it if they are in a cross server group (ie the two test servers). but i also imagine 4.3.3 is the groundwork to support D3 on live too whenever it goes retail ;)<br />
<br />
Here is the link to the D3 Beta 13 patch :<br />
<br />
http://us.battle.net/d3/en/forum/topic/3123246179#13<br />
<br />
Which would make sense since the PTR was down at exactly the same time as the maintenance for the D3 beta servers that was implenting beta patch 13. As soon as the D3 beta servers come back up the PTR servers also come back up.<br />
<br />
Also attempting to contact both the wow PTR login servers and the D3 beta login servers was resulting in a connection refused error message. Both within a few IP addresses of each one (one was .51 other was .56 IIRC) Also doing a traceroute to both IP addresses seemed to suggest both being in the same data center.</div></div><hr />

Did you even bothered to understand what i meant before going all offensive?<br />
I wasn'nt complaining.<br />
I was asking a question, because if 4.3.3 does not updates 64-bit wow automatically either i have to revert to 32-bit one or download it separately, meaning Blizzard has to provide the link. <br />
Or just go back to 32-bit one if they do not plan to update it on regular basis.</div></div><hr />

Current 64 bit client does not update automatically.<br />
<br />
64 bit client links for 4.3.3 have been posted in a sticky in the PTR discussion forums :<br />
<br />
http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3881708285<br />
<br />
They'll update it for each build but the automatic Launcher/tools update thing currently does not work for the 64 bit client yet.</div></div><hr />
