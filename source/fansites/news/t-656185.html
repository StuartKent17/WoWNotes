<br />
Trial of the Crusader - PTR Testing<br />
Here's the current schedule for Trial of the Crusader PTR testing:<br />
<br />
On the North American test realms:<br />
<br />
Lord Jaraxxus - Thursday Night, July 9, starting at 7pm EDT/4pm PDT.<br />
<br />
On the European test realms:<br />
<br />
Eydis Darkbane and Fjola Lightbane - Thursday Night, July 9, starting at 19:00 CEST.<br />
<br />
Note that only the 10 Player and 25 Player difficulties will be available on PTR. The Heroic versions will not be available. If you are usually part of raids that easily crushes Ulduar Hard Modes, you should find the non-Heroic difficulties to be not difficult.<br />
<br />
Koralon the Flame Watcher is also available to be tested in the Vault of Archavon depending on PTR Wintergrasp status.<br />
<br />
Test Patchwerks (Tank and DPS versions) will also be available in the Argent Coliseum during similar times to other bosses. Instead of the previous tank test patchwerk that increased melee damage over time, the 3.2 tank test patchwerk will just hit VERY hard (as hard as Algalon) all the time to allow for more lengthy sustained tank parses. We're always interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR, but especially test patchwerk logs. These are extremely helpful to our class team.<br />
<br />
This schedule could change at a moment's notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I'll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. The Trial of the Crusader and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc. These bosses are very much a work in progress, and this is a test server.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quick Trial of the Crusader FAQ:<br />
<br />
Q) Where's all the trash?<br />
A) There isn't any in this raid zone. Really.<br />
<br />
Q) Where's the loot?<br />
A) Loot is present on the bosses, but note that many of the items do not have final art.<br />
<br />
Q) What about achievements?<br />
A) Most of them are not fully implemented yet.<br />
<br />
Q) What about the Trial of the Champion (ie the 5 player dungeon)?<br />
A) This will see more extended testing later in the PTR cycle. <br />
<br />
Wintergrasp - PTR Focus Testing<br />
We have implemented several new changes to the Wintergrasp outdoor PVP area, and would like to request some focused testing and feedback. Games will be running at normal intervals on the PTR.<br />
<br />
As a reminder, here are the changes to Wintergrasp listed in the patch notes:<br />
<br />
Wintergrasp<br />
To provide players with a more transparent notification of when Wintergrasp battles occur, as well as better control zone population and stability, several changes have been made.<br />
<br />
Players now have the option to queue for Wintergrasp from a Wintergrasp Battlemaster in any capital city or by simply entering the Wintergrasp zone.<br />
Queuing will begin 15 minutes before each battle. If chosen, you will automatically be teleported to the zone. Any players in the zone who have not been chosen from the queue will be teleported out when the battle begins.<br />
The queue system remains active for the entire battle. As soon as a player leaves, a new one will be chosen from the queue.<br />
Trying to enter Wintergrasp during an active battle for which you have not been chosen will teleport you out. Please note that, as you are now able to fly over Wintergrasp, you will only be teleported out if you try to land and join the battle.<br />
Level 80 players get higher priority in the queue than lower level players. In addition, a random selection of queued players will be taken from both the Battlemasters and the zone itself.<br />
The queue will accept up to 100 players from each faction, resulting in a maximum battle of 200 players at a time.<br />
<br />
Wintergrasp factories can no longer be damaged or destroyed.</div></div><hr />

Why the hell does it exist? No trash? How do we go from fighting a celestial bureaucrat with solar systems shooting us in the face and the god of death to fighting a bunch of trivial bosses in a trivial, arena-based 'raid'? And moreover consider fighting a Worm in a 'tournament' to be an order of magnitude harder and more rewarding than that?<br />

My vital lore-ganisms are seriously depleted of nutrients right now, unless I'm really missing something essential. I'm willing to learn.</div></div><hr />

IMHO any raid qualified to be a tier should have its significance be transparent and obvious, not based on obscure dailies.<br />

Again, unless I'm wrong. I'm still waiting to be educated as to this place's purpose, other than gear and placation of the restless masses.</div></div><hr />

Tirion Fordring knows his enemy.<br />
<br />
The Horde and Alliance driving their entire armies right into Icecrown would be tactical suicide, as shown by the Valley of Fallen Heroes, mostly because every single hero lost is a minion gained for the Lich King. The very fact that we're messing with a powerful figure with the power to raise and command the dead and whose main objective is to destroy Azeroth itself using his undead army should be sign enough that we need to handle the invasion tactfully. A much better alternative would be a small task force that'll infiltrate Icecrown Citadel, much like how we entered the Black Temple. <br />
<br />
The problem is, how do you separate the heroes from the zeroes? After thinking long and hard, he decided....a DANCE TOURNAMENT!<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
But then Mograine smacked him on the head, so he took out the dancing part.<br />
<br />
The Argent Tournament was created for that purpose...to find the best of the best from both the Horde and Alliance, gear them for their excursion, and send them off in the next patch.</div></div><hr />

I think we've all realized at this point that absolutely nothing Blizzard does is going to please everyone. This is not a fault of the company, this is a fault of their fans. <br />
<br />
This is sort of the same phenomenon that people go through every time a video game movie is produced and all the fans of the game say the movie is shit and doesn't adhere to the source material. And even when the movies adhere religiously to the source material (like Death Race, where the cars would drive over literal, real life power-ups, the movie is still shit. Nothing Blizzard does now, tomorrow, or years from now will EVER stop the QQ. The best they can hope for is the least QQ possible out of every new thing they do. <br />
<br />
And with 11 million sets of tear ducts ready to unleash at a moment's notice....the odds are stacked against you.</div></div><hr />

I am so gonna piss myself an lolpoint at all the whiners about how shit the coliseum is, if that zone is a Nerubian raid Instances with like 5-8 more bosses. It would be awesome.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beckers</div><div class="date">2009-07-09, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wintergrasp<br />
To provide players with a more transparent notification of when Wintergrasp battles occur, as well as better control zone population and stability, several changes have been made.<br />
<br />
Players now have the option to queue for Wintergrasp from a Wintergrasp Battlemaster in any capital city or by simply entering the Wintergrasp zone.<br />
Queuing will begin 15 minutes before each battle. If chosen, you will automatically be teleported to the zone. Any players in the zone who have not been chosen from the queue will be teleported out when the battle begins.<br />
The queue system remains active for the entire battle. As soon as a player leaves, a new one will be chosen from the queue.<br />
Trying to enter Wintergrasp during an active battle for which you have not been chosen will teleport you out. Please note that, as you are now able to fly over Wintergrasp, you will only be teleported out if you try to land and join the battle.<br />
Level 80 players get higher priority in the queue than lower level players. In addition, a random selection of queued players will be taken from both the Battlemasters and the zone itself.<br />
The queue will accept up to 100 players from each faction, resulting in a maximum battle of 200 players at a time.<br />
Wintergrasp factories can no longer be damaged or destroyed.<br />

right. absolutly &quot;try again later&quot;. i hope the queue is smart enough to not be completly random. you should be put back x places in the queue for everytime you were in wg today/this week, so people with poor luck can get in too.</div></div><hr />

Agree. And this raid zone doesn't fill me with hope. Why the hell is the mighty Lich King allowing his enemies to put on a circus right in his own backyard? Whole thing is senseless and it seems like devs are paying hardly any attention to keeping players involved in the story of Wrath. It's more like an arcade game now, just turn up and fight what's in front of you. I'm still annoyed that Ulduar wasn't trailed better or seemed to represent any threat to the Kirin Tor, Alliance, Horde, or in fact anyone even just in Storm Peaks. So why did we go there? 'Cos Blizz told us to. Gief back attunements to get people involved in the story of the game.</div></div><hr />

They want us to end with PvE and go PvP. That's why are they sending us to arena.<br />
In normal arena is no trash too. And that &quot;final boss&quot; is not Anub'arak. When we finaly get to this last boss, huge arena queve will be offered to raid, and we have to wait, till raid from oposite faction is too in queve, and then face them :p.<br />
<br />
(meanwhile Anub'arak is watching us, and when one side win, he will laugh so much, that he'll die and you'll got the achievement)</div></div><hr />

Probably not. They'll say that &quot;there are new players joining us now that need to learn about raiding and all&quot;. The same way Ulduar doesn't start with a Malygos/KT boss fight (well, not that they're harder than other bosses anyway).</div></div><hr />

Hope that my guild understands that instead of just kicking me out of the raid ;)<br />

Doing ulduar without hardmodes may be smooth and fast, but try the mimirion hm or general hm and then say its eazy-mode ;)<br />
<br />
Yogg with 0 keepers is harder then anything in sunwell they say ;]<br />
<br />
Raids lke sunwell was stupid because 1% of population seen it, now like everyone can conquer uludar if they put some effort but still 1% of population have the more tricky hardmodes so stop whinning.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canopus</div><div class="date">2009-07-09, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, after reading this post, I have come up with a few conclusions:<br />
<br />
1) As we all know by now, there will never be a happy medium in WoW. Someone, somewhere will always QQ about some change done to WoW. <br />
<br />
2) Trash mobs. I kinda figured out ahead of time that this new raid instance wasn't going to be built to support the trash mobs. This raid instance was designed in the same fashion as the Ring of Blood / Ampitheater of Anguish events were set up. Five fights. Difficulty would increase with each encounter. So, no sense in QQ'ing about it. <br />
<br />
To play Devil's Advocate here, it would have be nice to face off with random trash mobs for the sole purpose of the increased difficulty and possible loot drops. <br />
<br />
3) Hopefully, both Crusader Coliseum and Icecrown Citadel will be considerably more difficult than Ulduar 25 man is presently. That is all we can really hope for. As a player, I would be very disappointed if they made both raid instances easy to walkthrough for the &quot;average joe&quot; guild. Of course, someone will QQ about this. Then, 4-6 months into the new content, Blizzard will cave in to the demands of the masses. Thus, the difficulty will be lowered, then the true difficulty that the &quot;super guilds&quot;, like Ensidia, faced will become easy mode for them. Hopefully the &quot;hard mode&quot; version may keep this guilds happy. Otherwise, they'll lose interest and then go back into PvP mode. <br />
<br />
I am also hoping for more of these &quot;hard mode&quot; for both Crusader Coliseum and Icecrown Citadel bosses. It make the game even more interesting.</div></div><hr />
