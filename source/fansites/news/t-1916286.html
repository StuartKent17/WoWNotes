Legion - Human Racial Changes<br />
In the next version of the Legion Alpha, we’re adjusting the Human racial ‘Every Man for Himself’ to only remove stun effects. The racial will share a 30 second cooldown with other similar effects.<br />
<br />
Due to the changes to PvP gear and the introduction of PvP talents in Legion, the Warlords of Draenor implementation of Every Man for Himself (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/59752-every-man-for-himself) no longer makes sense. So instead, we’re trying out an implementation that functions similar to Will of the Forsaken (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/7744-will-of-the-forsaken). It will only break Stun effects, but won’t trigger the full 2-minute cooldown on your Gladiator’s Medallion ability (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/42292-pvp-trinket) (which is the Legion version of the current Medallion trinkets).<br />
<br />
As always, this change isn't final, and we’re looking for feedback from testers once they’ve had some time with it. Please feel free to share your initial thoughts on this here, and for Alpha testers, take your feedback to the Alpha general discussion forum.<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion - Black Rook Hold Preview<br />
Black Rook Hold is a max level dungeon located in Val'sharah.<br />

<br />
<br />
The Amalgam of Souls<br />
Immense soul energy was released when Gul'dan conducted the ritual to sever Illidan's soul from his body at Black Rook Hold. This energy brought the souls of the Ravencrest clan back to their ancestral home - and residual soul energy has merged them into a massive monstrosity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview - The Amalgam of Souls battles players until reaching 50% health, at which point it ruptures, splitting into the tortured souls of the Ravencrest ancestors.<br />

<br />
<br />
Overview - Ilyssana fights players on the ground as her Fury bar builds. When it fills, she leaps into the air and unleashes deadly eye beams as she calls her risen guards to dispatch the party.

Lord Kur'talos Ravencrest<br />
Kur'talos Ravencrest, Lord of Black Rook Hold, was the commander of the Kal'dorei Resistance during the War of the Ancients until he was assassinated by Varo'then under the orders of Queen Aszhara. Millenea later, Gul'dan's foul soul magic has awoken Ravencrest's soul, and those of his ancestors, from their eternal repose.

Legion Alpha - Adventure Map Fix<br />
With a final data hotfix, code hotfix, and binary build deployed out, we've gotten this issue resolved and in as good of a state as we can with this server build.<br />
<br />
That said, if you were able to bypass the map and manually went to the zones, it's possible that certain NPCs are in a different phase than your own. We're looking into this, but that's likely a problem we can't solve today. It's still worth entering bug reports for since it's a legitimate way players could get broken on live retail servers when the expansion launches.<br />
<br />
Thanks for being patient as we go through this, we tracked down some problems with how certain files are committed to public data containers vs internal local files. This is why your Alpha/Beta/PTR testing is so important - you're playing through the game in a public client, which hits a lot of different areas that we don't see internally (ideally this is the same content, but in terms of installation/updating/streaming it's a different beast.)<br />
<br />
Testing is terrific!<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler talks about game design and occasionally WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
1.) If you are a hardcore gamer, how do you know how to design a game for a casual audience? Or even a broad audience?<br />
1. You need a ton of empathy and probably a lot of playtesting with casual players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671880125110087684))<br />
<br />
4.) Arent factions in mmorpgs contrary to best gameplay? As like building bgs out of mercenaries and not tauren versus gnomes<br />
4. But factions add a lot of emotional investment. The &quot;us vs them&quot; drive is strong in humans. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671880868529475584))<br />
<br />
5.) Why so many skinner boxes? In special in MMORPGs. Sometimes i feel like a pigeon pushing the bacon button..<br />
5. Games are ultimately about using tools to overcome obstacles to earn rewards. The best games don't make it so obvious though. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671881035504738304))<br />
<br />
6.) How could a mythic raider create a engaging LFR implementation? If he never plays it.<br />
6. I was a mythic raider and I was largely the LFR designer. I just tried to put myself in that mind set. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671881210793070592))<br />
6. You might not like LFR (and I am pretty honest about its shortcomings) but I don't think they stem from my being too hardcore (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671881369438437376))<br />
<br />
8.) Is the balancing concept in WoW something like &quot;Perfect imbalance&quot; or was the intend rock-paper-scissors-spock-lizard?<br />
8) When I was there, it was intended to be that you have strengths and weaknesses and so does everyone else. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671881740386865152))<br />
8) I can't speak to their philosophy today obviously. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/671881785123299328))<br />

Today's Heroes patch added the Recruit a Friend system! It rewards you with a Heroes mount when you recruit 4 players that reach level 10. The friends you recruit get a 5 day stimpack and 2 free heroes. The patch brought some other updates as well, such as more free hero slots and the removal of talent gating. <br />

<br />
Funny thing is it never was. the 378s from Firelands was plenty for Dragon soul, the 463s from MoP heroics were enough to get 489s from MSV and some people had crafted/rep stuff as well and the 630/636 dungeon gear and 640 crafted/cm gear was enough for normal progression in WoD. Factored on in MoP and WoD that LFR didn't open until a while after then it was in no way mandatory by then. Anyone saying LFR is mandatory is a fool plain and simple. As for later tiers your normal/hc gear is enough for the next content by the time it's out. Only reason they feel LFR is mandatory now is because of Valor and upgrades.</div></div><hr />

And it's come with noticeable side effects. If the balance/resto druid 4-piece T18 set bonus was bugged to the point of being effectively nonfunctional, the mythic progression guilds would ensure that Blizzard knows and releases a hotfix ASAP.<br />
<br />
But it's a different story with the LFR &quot;tier&quot; sets we've had this expansion: the leather LFR set's 4-piece has been broken for balance and resto druids for over four months. But it's a problem unique to LFR gear, so it'll still be broken when the 7.0 patch hits live servers. Because not enough (vocal) people care -- and that includes Blizzard employees.<br />
<br />
And that's a problem that will continue with Legion if LFR continues to have its own unique gear. Just like LFR also continues to give not just lower-item-level gear, but in the case of trinkets, also dramatically under-budget lower-item-level gear.</div></div><hr />

Tbh I'll admit that the WoD LFR trinkets were just appalling. Infact any trinket with just pure stats like that can go to hell. Problem with LFR is they don't really care since the content is there now for the casual or time restricted player.</div></div><hr />

Making it only affect 1 of 6 CC's classes instead of all of them? Seems like a Nerf to me.<br />
<br />
I'm actually quite sad since I loved the Fear breaking of EMFH in PvE. I gave zero shits about the PvP side of it. Since PvP &quot;balance&quot; in this game is what has removed a lot of the fun of this game.</div></div><hr />

I honestly didn't know about that issue. In fairness though, the LFR tier bonuses are so bad beyond the flat 2pc-bonus stat increase that I've never even tried for the 4-pc bonus. (And there are better secondary stats from off-tier in general, too.)<br />

Indeed. At first I was ok with the LFR changes, thought it'd change little. Boy was I wrong. Hindsight sure is a bitch.<br />

Plus the lack of LFR being a variation of other difficulties makes it so we have one less recolor of each raid's sets. That makes the collector in me sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WotF too strong, so they nerf it, some time later, they give Humans an even better version of WotF, they never reverted back WotF, kept EMFH for YEARS even when every PvP player changed factions and now you see ONLY Humans in every Arena Ladder since years... and then now for Legion they change it to a WotF kind of Spell just for stuns (which is still much stornger than WotF or others) and saying, it wouldn't make sense with EMFH because of new PvP talents? So it made sense BEFORE in their eyes? Is Blizzard seriously playing their own game? Sometimes i really think they are trolling like crazy and so such stupid shit and comments on purpose, because... yeh, you can't be THAT dumb to be honest.</div></div><hr />

I was really hoping they would remove trinket style racials and use the pvp changes as a chance to give all players, regardless of race, a trinket spell while replacing EMFH with something new and unique. <br />
<br />
Instead they went for the boring easy route to appease the crybabies; as usual.<br />

exactly. I just do not understand their insistence on this issue.</div></div><hr />

One of the best news for faction balance and PvP Players<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure it will be final, good riddance.<br />
<br />
Better news would be for them to remove radials from pvp to get rid of any imbalances they cause.</div></div><hr />

I wish that pvp was its own thing, that some skills that &quot;don't fit&quot; or &quot;aren't balanced&quot; for pvp would simply be disabled or worked differently in pvp instead of making changes that remove all race/class fun. I remember when I started playing in TBC and one of things to consider when choosing race was if racial was useful for the class I chose (nice with extra heal on warrior when leveling at that time etc) and playstyle I chose. It was same with races. I liked that some races/classes were better in some things and worse in others. Nobody says that you can only have one character, one main for everything. Unfortunately hardcore players and pvp players have to expose every inbalance and demand all feeling same strong in every aspect because in their case it matters. In their case it is boring if for example all healers in hardcore raid are of X class as they work best in that scenario. For normal players, doing normal raids, some hc dungeons and harder raid from time to time, it doesnt matter that their class is a little worse in some encounters (and a little better in others as things usualy even out) and they arent kicked from raiding for that. Plus that exceptional player can do better even in worse circumstances than a player playing &quot;better class&quot; (for the situation) with better armor. Wow became all about balancing while it doesn't concern a lot most of players as most of players are normal or casual and don't use their classes to maximum of their potential anyway.</div></div><hr />

Why can't they just give each race the same racial between factions. It's not that hard. It's the ONLY way to balance racials in PVP without disabling them completely.<br />

WoTF is still garbage. Every Fear and Charm effect is easily re-applied. All people do is trick Undead players into using their WotF so it puts their trinket on cooldown.</div></div><hr />

Immense soul energy was released when Gul'dan conducted the ritual to sever Illidan's soul from his body at Black Rook Hold. This energy brought the souls of the Ravencrest clan back to their ancestral home - and residual soul energy has merged them into a massive monstrosity.<br />

Umm, what? Illidan wasnt in Black Rook Hold, he was in Vault of the Wardens. BRH is in Val'sharah, VotW is in Aszuna. It has nothing to do with Black Rook Hold. WTF Kosak/Blizz?!?</div></div><hr />

simple... the game cant handle huge numbers so the game requires a stat squish every 2 expansions from now on till the end of the games lifespan. if you still dont understand this then ur not a bright fellow...</div></div><hr />

If you bothered to read I asked why are they higher than MoPs if like you said the game can't handle huge numbers. Perhaps read yourself before resorting to insults.</div></div><hr />

The squish had less to do with ridiculously high numbers, and more to do with straightening the ilvl curve. Basically, all the ilvl jumps through raid gear in vanilla -&gt; cata were merged into one ilvl per character level. It had the effect of lowering the numbers by quite a bit, but it's still going to grow, and the ilvl curve will keep ramping up, until they feel it necessary to apply the same technique to other &quot;irrelevant&quot; expansions raids in the future.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but 1 million is a bit overkill coming up from 400-700k isn't it?</div></div><hr />

Yea, they need to make EMFH baseline for every race. This way they can remove PvP trinkets entirely imo. However this is definitely a buff the more I thought about it. Kind of scary Blizzard didn't realize this, however it's still early in alpha/beta and I personally dont see it going live as is.<br />

That's exactly what they're doing with the new PVP talents.<br />
<br />
Not entirely, because EMFH is buffed now. It just needs to be a racial for every class...For the Horde and For the Alliance, I know the names i just said are stupid but it would make balancing pvp a lot easier and would keep from people swaying to one side for rated pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's becoming more or less the same as Will of the Forsaken, just clearing another type of impairment. The new PVP talents offer everyone what EMFH is on live servers right now. It's the very first one you have access to with all classes.<br />

I don't see the change as either a buff or a nerf, it's something entirely different. It just carries over the old name.</div></div><hr />

VERY good idea to make a Sylvanas-based tier set. Don't like the woman much, but she has style.<br />

I especially love the bright green variant, but also the more darker ones. Ohhh man.</div></div><hr />
