China - Flying Pig Mount<br />
JiangWing spotted (https://twitter.com/JiangWing/status/1088808883223699461) a flying pig mount promo posted early on the WoW China site. This is likely the encrypted pig mount that was added in Patch 8.1.<br />

You cannot spend gold on server transfers, you have to convert it to battle.net balance first. Battle.net balance is a representation of real world money. No matter how you slice it, a lot of money was spent.</div></div><hr />

Yeah kind of hilarious &quot;LOL WE DIDN'T SPEND $5k&quot; yeah but the people who you traded Gold for B.net balance did.<br />
<br />
Ironically Blizzard would've made less Money if they spent the 5K themselves, since they get a $5 cut between token and B.net balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A friend of mine has millions of wow gold from years of playing. He buys everything on the bnet launcher just because he can. Unless he sells gold or bnet balance in ways that are against the ToS, that gold is no way similar to real world money. There is nothing left for him to purchase with it.</div></div><hr />

I'll never get this mentality. Why are they the bad guys exactly?<br />
<br />
A top guild went alliance. That hasn't been the case in a long time. Alliance had an edge, and players chose it. That is only a bad thing when it leads to mass faction changes like horde racials caused years ago.</div></div><hr />

Except as others have stated, they spent zero, zip, zilch, nada, nothing! They used in game gold. Other people foot the bill with purcahsing wow tokens and the like and in b.net balance; however, the guild members themselves paid nothing out of their own pockets except a monthly fee while they sold things like raid clears, mounts, and other stuff.<br />
Trying to laugh at them for not spending money is ludicrous and dumb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard didn't get a dime off anyone that they wouldn't have anyway. I assume this guild has been selling carries for a while and piling up gold. They didn't run exactly enough carries to get exactly the gold they needed to faction transfer.<br />
<br />
The people who paid for those carries would have paid them or someone else for the carries. It's not like their transfer created people out of thin air who wanted to buy carries.<br />
<br />
Net new money for blizzard from their faction transfer is for all practical purposes zero. The only beneficiaries of it are the buyers of gold who got a bit more gold because limit's token purchases would have tweaked the gold cost of tokens up a bit.</div></div><hr />

this is hilarious. blizzard gave alliance the advantage. Just as horde had one with racials over many expansions causing most top guilds to be on horde today. After yeeears alliance has an advantage for a tier, but anyone who takes it is &quot;p2w stench&quot; lol.</div></div><hr />

What other people did to obtain the gold to pay Limit is an entirely different story.<br />

Yeah, really not a big deal. What I hate about them though is their super edgy attitudes so they always have the cop out of &quot;we weren't even trying, lol this game sucks&quot; when they inevitably lose.

<br />
Its pretty obvious its because of the huge amount of money they will make from Twitch for live streaming this event especially when they only stream through their own parent channel its win win win all the way to the bank for Method<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I wish they would have gotten Asmon to do the shoutcasting for Method. When he was doing it, it was actually really good and about the only time I've ever really enjoyed him outside non-character interviews.<br />
<br />
I would imagine he has been asked already but declined although I have an Idea he might 'pop' in for a few hours like last time, Asmon streams for a living, its his job and he has consecutively 20/30k viewers when he is doing nothing most of the time so committing to this event would kinda be a bad move for him.<br />
<br />
That said, I agree he did a great job last time and would be a huge asset for the Method channel, but obviously he has worked out the business technicalities already.</div></div><hr />
