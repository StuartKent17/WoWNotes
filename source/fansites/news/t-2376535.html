To be fair they never said it was China exclusive. They said the 6 month sub deal was china exclusive and people just kind of assumed. Realistically we should have known that they were gonna cash-shop it for the rest of the regions, or at least been ready for the possibility.</div></div><hr />

The gift, which includes a chance to get tcg mounts in addition to this, is what is exclusive. Would be pretty stupid of them to keep the vast majority of Chinese players from even being able to get this mount, seeing as much more of them play on US servers.</div></div><hr />

The new store mount is a cute flavor +1, but nowhere near holds the same quality that mounts we've gotten in-game have had as of Legion. As it should be! I love the description of it though, hope we'll someday see Vale of Eternal Blossoms rebuilt. <br />

Aaw, poor little one has managed to overlook the far more numerous great mounts added through in-game means, and probably can't scrape together the gold needed for Battle.net balance. <br />

<br />
I think this one is fine for a store mount. It's a standalone mount that doesn't really take anything from the game, just like they said when they introduced the Celestial Steed. The Blizzcon mounts were fine for cash models too, iconic concept but at the same time not something you'd imagine being created naturally for in game content.<br />
<br />
What sucks is when they take flagship expansion mounts and they place them in the store like they did in WoD. Rylaks mobs were everywhere and half the flight paths used them, but for the longest time if you wanted one your only option was the store. Even when they added a reskin, it was just one, and with an atypical funky palette. Same for Dread Ravens, Ravagers, Fairy Dragons, Bats... the moose was almost a store mount too.<br />
<br />
I can't expect Blizzard not to put some mounts on the store because there's a demand for them from players, so I'm actually happy when it's something like this that doesn't look like it was obviously stolen away from a rep vendor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And we once had a promotion that resulted in other regions (China included I believe) &quot;having&quot; to pay for the promo mount from their shop on top of sub fees. <br />
<br />
Life's not always fair.</div></div><hr />

Newfy. Berner. They're pretty similar to each other. From memory, the Berner breed was saved by &quot;injecting&quot; it with healthy Newfy bloodlines anyway. Cousins seperated by sea (which they'd both probably try to swim anyway) :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Interesting point on the ears, both newfie and berners have floppy ears. Some breeders clip them to have them point upwards.</div></div><hr />

Either way, I'm pleasantly surprised by how small it is, unlike mounts like the Imperial Quilen which this dog shares skeleton with.<br />

I also find it funny how the tables have turned. During the time of the Annual Pass which rewarded us with the Tyrael's Charger + D3 and whatnot, people were complaining about that mount not being made optional via the store and how the Koreans were SO LUCKY to be able to buy JUST the mount without signing up for 1 year of sub.</div></div><hr />

I don't blame Blizzard, they're basically printing free money. It's you I hate, consumers. It's you.<br />
<br />
That's you. So what? Some people spend ludicrous amounts of money on other things that many find frivolous -- expensive sports cars, private yachts, whatever. <br />
<br />
Why does the spending of another person have to bother you? It's a store mount. AFAIK you can use gold to eventually get Blizzard in-store credit to be able to buy the mount anyway without spending money in real life. And even if they did, what's it to you? It's not your money. And having in-store mounts is not detrimental to the game, especially when there is an in-game way to acquire them. <br />
<br />
You're whining for absolutely no reason other than to whine.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
I don't understand why some WoW players get so worked up about how other people choose to spend their own damn money. It's their money. It's as obnoxious as people telling me not to eat out when I can &quot;cook my own food&quot;. I'll cook when I want to cook, I'll spend $25 on KKBQ if I want to. What's it to you?<br />
<br />
Also, you can buy store mounts through a process using in-game gold anyway, right? So what's the big deal? It's one mount. There are what, only a dozen of in-store mounts and there are hundreds of in-game ones. <br />
<br />
People here praise capitalism but get upset when Blizz does capitalistic things -- aka charging extra for extra things. <br />
<br />
The value of something differs from person to person. Get that into y'all's nogging.</div></div><hr />

Because people are haters who love nothing more than to find some way to be outraged by anything Blizzard does. It was announced as a promo in China only they raged 'why don't we get it?' It was announced we could get it too they raged 'why did they get it for free and we didn't?' They're out to complain and they'll find something to complain about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either way, I'm pleasantly surprised by how small it is, unlike mounts like the Imperial Quilen which this dog shares skeleton with.<br />
<br />
I also find it funny how the tables have turned. During the time of the Annual Pass which rewarded us with the Tyrael's Charger + D3 and whatnot, people were complaining about that mount not being made optional via the store and how the Koreans were SO LUCKY to be able to buy JUST the mount without signing up for 1 year of sub.<br />

You know that people might have different opinions, right? Unfortunately [insert made up number]% of users are too dumb to understand that.<br />
<br />
It would be ideal if mount was available both ways: via pass thingie and shop. But developers today are not the same that designed old WoW when game had choices, now everything is linear with only 1 choice or illusion of choice.</div></div><hr />

Sadly I was not elligible for the annual pass because of the country I live in (apparently some legal issue pertaining to the legality of the contract under South Africa law and because we're such a small market Blizzard didn't bother to get their lawyers to sort it out). Was really annoying since I was happy to sign up, plus I was subscribed for the entire period anyway :/</div></div><hr />

To be honest only few store mounts I have are Heart of the Aspects, Grinning Reaver, Celestial Steed and Winged Guardian. And those are the only 4 that I really wanted.<br />
<br />
Funny how beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I find those mounts that you like the least appealing of them all.<br />

Which now costs even more. The Warframe is now 500k up from 400K. <br />

There is absolutely no reason to complain with how just playing the game and dedicated 20 minutes to making gold, you can make a small fortune in no time.</div></div><hr />

There is absolutely no reason to complain with how just playing the game and dedicated 20 minutes to making gold, you can make a small fortune in no time. It's not even about how fast / slow you can make gold, it's about &quot;real money&quot; store goods are no different from &quot;gold in game&quot; vendor goods. Don't have gold? Buy a token for $ to get gold and buy an in game mount for gold. Have gold? Convert it into token / balance and buy store mount. If the mount was faster or had special functions, people would have some basis to complain it's locked behind a paywall. But last of those was the MOP yak and that was long before tokens existed.</div></div><hr />

What does that even mean? Economics doesn't work that way. If you have nothing, with 20 minutes of work; you have 20 minutes worth of reward. The market would be changing to make sure your work doesn't reward you more than you deserve(people compare the amount of work they've put in for their money and price it for you accordingly.) 20 minutes of work isnt a fortune.<br />
<br />
It's only once you've done that 20 minutes of work a hundred times that those 20 minutes reward you more; and its only because you've invested 200 hours already.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess people don't like wow tokens because they liked having their economies separate. In the past, wow gold was actually valuable for people other than Blizzard. <br />
It was the 20th most valuable economy in the world at one time.</div></div><hr />

I meant 20 minutes per day and you are incorrect. Two different people who spend 20 minutes earning gold, if one person spends it efficiently due to proper research and another does not, the rewards will be different. For example, I knew BFA would raise token values so I purchased several tokens at 160k and then sold them for close to 300k when BFA was announced. <br />
<br />
As for the issue of being able to purchase tokens and vice versa — that’s a different discussion / argument to one I’m addressing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not what I meant or what you meant in your original statement. Two people with equal knowledge of the game, one spends 20 minutes at day 1 makes less than the person who spends 20 minutes on day 1000.<br />

And that still doesnt mean anything, the economy literally inflated by 140k so all goods you buy has increased in price; your money is just a larger number not worth more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not true though. All goods did not increase in price, only the value of tokens due to demand beating supply. The entire market didn't suddenly shift to reflect the inflated token prices. Especially since they decreased as soon as demand for BFA pre-order/tokens slowed down. <br />
<br />
Unless I'm misunderstanding your point, I think you're arguing with yourself. <br />
<br />
My original sentiment was that people shouldn't complain a mount is locked behind a paywall considering you can still purchase the mount with gold by converting the gold into Blizzard store tokens. Something Blizzard definitely benefits from considering the adverse results in people buying gold with money. Arguing that the economies should be separate is certainly valid and one for another discussion. However, I am addressing people complaining simply because it is $25 and not 400K gold in-game only. I think people lose sight of the correlation between something on the Blizzard store (purchasable with tokens purchasable with cash or gold) and something sold by a vendor (purchasable with gold purchasable with tokens purchasable with cash) considering there are far more dilemma ridden posts when the store hosts a new mount over an in-game vendor.</div></div><hr />
