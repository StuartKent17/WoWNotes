yes alpha is up. But of course only for very few people. Mostly those who work for Blizzard directly.</div></div><hr />

Looks like hunter ferocity pets get Bloodlust as their baseline ability, which makes a heck of a lot of sense. As it is now, hunters can only choose between like 3 pets depending on their special ability.</div></div><hr />

Okay, so there's an &quot;item level squish&quot;, down to ~150 for Level 110 players currently at 900+<br />

I remember this question being answered at Blizzcon in one of the panels. They had stated that they wouldn't be expanding the DK races because all DKs are &quot;created in Wrath of the Lich King time&quot;, so whatever they have now is what they are gonna stay as (although they have added races before to the DK list, but I guess this is how they will go forward maybe.)</div></div><hr />

I've been planning to change my current monk into a Zandalari Troll since they were announced because their muscular upright bodies look PERFECT for a martial artist type character. Here we see they currently have NO animations in the model viewer for monks, even though they've recycled many of the stiff ass male Night Elf animations, it seems. To top things off, even NIGHTBORNE can be monks! They were hiding in their magically bubbled city while all the other races were discovering Pandaria and learning how to become monks. The Zandalari Trolls were ALL OVER PANDARIA during that expansion! How are they going to let Nightborne be monks, and seemingly not allow Zandalari monks? This is absolutely stupid, and I hate it to the core.</div></div><hr />

Mmm Protection Warriors and Affli Warlocks have a couple of talent changes. In fact I think they removed Drain Soul and replaced it with Shadow Bolt. But I think it's too soon to speculate.<br />

You're joking about the prot warrior talent changes... right?<br />
<br />
Indomitable was split in half with the other half going into never surrender.<br />
<br />
Devastator is still competing with two survival talent boosters, which is still f!@%ed up.</div></div><hr />

It is beyond me how you can have that opinion regarding Zandalari Paladins, when you mention creating a Tauren Paladin in the same post</div></div><hr />

While those races did become Allied Races later, we still intend to use this approach for non-playable races. <br />
<br />
Please don’t take a race being datamined in this way as an indication that it will become playable in the future!&quot;<br />

<br />
If you read up on tauren lore, it makes sense for them to be paladin's. The sun is worshipped the same way as the light in tauren culture. They had same classes as paladin's called sun striders, but blizz decides to just melt them in with paladin's because they were so similar. I don't remember anything like this with trolls.</div></div><hr />

This game has gone on this long and Horde still only has two choices for Paladin, Blood Elf and Tauren, so really one choice. I want more choices :(<br />
<br />
In the last Q and A session, there were hints that the storyline for horde would involve something about Zandalari Paladins, so maybe that class will be unlockable later?</div></div><hr />
