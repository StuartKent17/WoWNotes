&lt;a name=&quot;part2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Wrath of the Lich King Preview - Part 2<br />
You should really definitely check the preview on Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1), this is one of the most interesting published today.<br />
Inscription<br />
Inscribers will create glyphs that allow players to modify their spells and abilities. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
Going by the first recipe, which requires Peacebloom, they'll rely on the herbalist gathering profession. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
Every player will get a new spell book page to which they can add six glyphs - currently, four major and two minor. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
Major glyphs will be effective in combat - adding damage over time or stun to a physical attack, for example - while minor glyphs will give convenient or cosmetic improvements, removing the need for some spell reagents. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
Glyphs can be sold at the Auction House (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Enchanting<br />
Allowing enchanters sell their enchantments at the Auction House is still planned.(Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Lake Wintergrasp / Vehicles<br />
The new vehicle technology, which introduces physics and handling characteristics - including inertia, turning circle, grip and suspension bounce - to land and airborne vehicles and special mounts. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
It also allows for up to eight passengers per vehicle, and brings up bespoke action bars and skills for vehicle and turret operators. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
It was intended to be used solely for PVP siege weapons - Dwarven steam tanks, Forsaken plague spreaders and Orc demolishers. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World<br />
Even if you'll be able to meet him as soon as you reach Dragonblight (LVL 71-75), the final encounter against Arthas won't be until the last patch of the Lich King cycle. The Icecrown Citadel, will appear after launch. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
Dragonblight will also let you reunite (violently) with the Scarlet Crusade. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
Players will meet a lot of monsters from Classic WoW in the Grizzly Hills, including Furbolgs, Kobolds, the Venture Company, and Worgen Werewolves. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
Arugal (http://www.wowwiki.com/Archmage_Arugal) has been resurrected and now leads the Worgen Werewolves in Grizzly Hills. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
In Grizzly Hills, you will also find an evil sister city to the Alliance capital, Ironforge. (Screenshot ? (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/may/evilironforge.jpg)) (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
The Argent Dawn faction returns in Zul'Drak. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
In Sholazar Basin, you'll take part in a faction-reputation war between the Wolvar (sentient wolves) and Oracles (&quot;the next evolution of the Murlocs&quot; - a worrying thought). A much lighter take on reputation gaming is promised here, with players actively encouraged to defect to the other side at will. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />
The expansion will contain a lot of &quot;vehicle quests&quot; as an evolution of BC's bombing runs - throwing flaming oil at Worgen from horseback, airlifting supplies in a gyrocoptor, and yes, mammoth wrangling. (Eurogamer.net (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=138018&amp;page=1))<br />

Information summary<br />
Death Knights<br />
All players with a level 55 character will be able to create one Death Knight per realm, per account. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
Blizzard's designers decided to start the class with a full complement of abilities right off the bat, figuring that any player that has advanced a character to level 55 would be able to learn to handle the new class with minimal difficulty. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
Death Knights will have a summonable Skeletal Deatcharger Mount. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
Death Knights aren't using Mana or Energy, the runes are their primary source of power and are slotted into their &quot;blade,&quot; which lies underneath their health bar as a visual indicator of what resources are available to the player at any given moment. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
Spent runes automatically refresh after a set period of time, much like a Rogue's energy bar. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
There are six slots in the blade, and the player is free to fill those slots with any given number of Blood, Unholy or Frost runes. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
Death Knights also have a secondary resource called Runic Power generated by using your rune abilities. It will use the same mechanics as rage and increase when you deal damage, or slowly decrease if you're not using it. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
Death Knights will have a lot of abilities that cost all available Runic Power with varying levels of effectiveness based on total Runic Power spent. (Same mechanics as Execute for warriors, or finishing moves for Rogues) (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
Death Knights will have spells equivalent to auras called &quot;Presence&quot;, providing them with powerful self-buffs depending on their role in the group. (One for tanking, one for damage dealing, etc ...) (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
An instant lifedrain spell (described as death coil without the fear component) will be available. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
Death Knights will be the first class to use diseases as a source of damage, with abilities that become strong depending on how many diseases are already applied to the target. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
&quot;Army of the Dead&quot; will spawn numerous undead minions to attack nearby hostiles targets. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
Death Knights will also revive an enemy (or ally) as a ghoul to use it as a pet with its own special abilities like a disease-inflicting strike and a stun. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
When an ally is risen as a ghoul, a pop-up will appear and this ally will have the choice to control the ghoul if he wants to. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
The Death Knight's particular niche will be in tanking magic-damage-dealing bosses. They will have an ability much like a banshee's anti-magic shell, greatly diminishing the amount of incoming magic damage they'll receive in combat (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872730p1.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Knight Skills<br />
Death Coil -- Depletes all Runic Power, dealing 600 damage to a non-Undead target, or healing 900 damage on a friendly target. (Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/articles/details/9634/))<br />
Death Grip -- This is the Death Knight's &quot;taunt&quot; ability. It also pulls the target to the Death Knight, forcing them to attack the Death Knight for a short amount of time. Yes, I said pulls the target; Blizzard is going to allow players to move mobs in the expansion both with Death Grip, and other knockback/pull abilities. This works on players too, so PvP balance ahoy! (Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/articles/details/9634/))<br />
Chains of Ice -- Roots the target in place. When the spell fades, it places a snare on the target that reduces in potency as the duration runs out. (Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/articles/details/9634/))<br />
Death Pact -- Sacrifices the raised ghouls to heal the Death Knight. (Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/articles/details/9634/))<br />
Death and Decay -- Targeted, AoE Damage-over-time which pulses similar to the Paladin spell Consecration. Anyone affected by Death and Decay has a chance to be feared. (Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/articles/details/9634/))<br />
Frost Presence -- Increases Armor by 45% and allows the Death Knight to generate 25% more threat. Only one presence can be active at any time. (Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/articles/details/9634/))<br />
Unholy Presence -- Increases Attack Speed and Movement speed by 15%. Only one presence can be active at any time. This was described by Tom Chilton as the &quot;PvP&quot; presence. (Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/articles/details/9634/))<br />
Anti-magic Shield -- Reduces the damage of the next magical spell cast on the Death Knight by 75%. It also converts the damage reduced into Runic Power. (Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/articles/details/9634/))<br />
Strangulate -- Depletes all Runic Power, dealing minor damage and silencing the target for up to 5 seconds. (Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/articles/details/9634/))<br />
Summon Deathcharger -- Allows the Death Knight to summon a Deathcharger mount. This mount is acquired through quests, similar to the Paladin and Warlock land mounts. (Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/articles/details/9634/))<br />
Raise Dead -- Raises a nearby corpse to fight for the Death Knight for 2 minutes. If used on a player corpse, the player has the option to play as the ghoul for the duration -- gaining access to the ghoul's abilities. (Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/articles/details/9634/))<br />
The ghoul has the ability to do the following:<br />
Leap to the target<br />
Rend for decent damage-over-time<br />
Stun target, and of course more <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
All raid dungeons in Wrath of the Lich King will have both 10-person and 25-person versions. So at level 80, every major encounter and every big boss fight can be experienced with a group of 10. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872794p1.html))<br />
25-person raiding progression is not dependent on 10-person raiding progression. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872794p1.html))<br />
There will be no attunements or keys to obtain, and you won't be locked out of a 25-person instance if you decide to attempt the 10-person version, and vice-versa. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872794p1.html))<br />
25-person raids will earn more, higher-level rewards, in what should be the equivalent of one &quot;tier&quot; of loot quality. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872794p1.html)) <br />
A new instance focused on the different dragonflights &quot;The Chamber of Aspects&quot; might be added to the game, but this isn't confirmed yet. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872789p1.html))<br />
Zero raid bosses have been designed at this point. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872789p1.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Others<br />
Players will unlock their flying mount at level 77. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872789p1.html))<br />
You can use your Outland flying mount, and new flying mounts will be available. (Gamespy.com (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft-wrath-of-the-lich-king/872789p1.html))<br />

So at level 80, every major encounter and every big boss fight can be experienced with a group of 10.<br />
That sounds actually pretty boring. :(</div></div><hr />

I guess its so everyone can experience every part of the game. But i believe the 10man versions wont have near as good rewards as the 25man, and will probably not include the Tier sets. So for &quot;casuals&quot;, this is great news. But i wonder how its going to work out with tuning and stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Essentially, dispelling stacking debuffs generally take 3 or 4 times as long as stacking them up do, and while dispelling you do nothing else since they take a 1.5s GCD tick. Considering that the trash debuffs tend to be side-effects or instant effect outside GCD (frost mage slow effects, hunter pet poisons, etc), it is often better to just ignore the debuffs.<br />
<br />
Ah well, I'll likely re-roll to that class anyway, considering that Blizzard has shown through action their unwillingness to continue developing the Paladin class at the same pace as most other classes.</div></div><hr />

25 man gear will be superior and &quot;cooler&quot; as it has always been. The thing is that blizzard understand that many wow players don't have the time to go hardcore and raid 25 man. 10 man is much easier to put together, and now the great amount of &quot;casuals&quot; will actually be able to see content that were restricted to hardcore players. 25 man raiding will always be the toughest, and most challenging and hardcore players will still find this mode to be their choice of gaming.

<br />
What is the advantage to raiding in 25-mans then? If it isn't unique gear then why wouldn't someone just do 10-mans? Why would it be tougher? Coordination is a non-factor when you have a strong core of players you've been playing with for months. I have a feeling Blizzard just plans on increasing the HP/Damage of encounter and the stats of gear for the 25-mans.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Which part of 25man loot will be superior did u not understand? <br />
<br />
<br />
Superior in what way though? Different designs? Or the &quot;Blizzard&quot; way of doing it - a different shade of color on the same rehashed sets that will likely be given out via Arena AND 10-mans.</div></div><hr />

Having made 0 raid bosses means that they haven't finalized on what's going to really happen, they said the loot was going to be lower quality on 10-mans. If it were me designing the loot I would make a greater and lesser versions of each armor piece with the lesser version having a suffix and giving lower stats/bonus and recolored of course. I would say that the item level of the mid 25-man raids would be on par with the end-10-mans. As for tier armor, i guess i would remove them from 10 mans, replacing them with a recolored version with lower stats and non-set bonus. But alas it's up to blizzard and we can only speculate.<br />
<br />
On par with what you're saying runing heroics is also useless, since we have the normal versions of the 5-mans it's a waste to do heroics.</div></div><hr />

Thought I've read somewhere that 10-man loot is one tier below 25-man. <br />
So if 25 drops t8, you only get t7 out of it in 10man.<br />

And I would be perfectly fine with this IF Blizzard actually designs different looking gear for the 25-mans and 10-mans. If they go the cheap route (Arena Gear) and just change the color then it will be a total cop out.</div></div><hr />

GameSpy: So in any given Wrath of the Lich King 10-man raid, how often will the Death Knight be the ideal tank for a given situation, as opposed to a Warrior, Druid or Paladin?<br />
<br />
Kaplan: That's a good question, but we've designed zero raid bosses at this point, so I really couldn't tell you. A good way to think about it is not what you can or can't be successful at as a Death Knight tank. Someone earlier brought up the Shattered Halls dungeon's gauntlet where you have to fight off infinite elites, and a Paladin is the ideal tank for that situation. <br />
<br />

If Blizzard throws the same loot tables in 10 and 25 mans with only added stats it will be useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then you're exactly the target of these 10-mans, casuals who want to enjoy the whole content. The 25-man versions still exist to maintain the more hardcore user base.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't get what u mean by this?<br />
<br />
<br />
Meaning that basicaly 25-man raids in WLK are the heroic version of the 10-man. Same bosses, similar strategies only difficulty changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I believe that it's totally doable. They still have 7 months to go if they release on the november 30th date i saw on gametrailers.<br />
<br />
Designing the bosses isn't really that hard for them, they are experienced at it and probably already have some ideas. Knowing blizzard they already know which bosses are going to show up and where, they just need to design the encounters themselves. It's common to leave this for last since you don't want to design an encounter that doesn't add up with the questlines and lore associated to them, which is being created right now.<br />
<br />
edit: I forgot to mention. I don't believe on that release date, IMO it will be released in mid/late-summer. But my guess is as good as any.</div></div><hr />

Sooo excited about WotLK. I honestly think it'll just confirm WoW as the undefeated champion amongst MMO's and boost their position even more.<br />
<br />
And cudos to Blizzard for taking so much of their player's suggestions into the game. I'm a hardcore raider myself, but I welcome the opening up of the instances to groups of 10 people aswell. Casuals have been wanting it for so long now, and it'll finally end (most) of the casuals vs hardcore crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course. I killed Cenarius with 10 Fel Orcs in Warcraft 3, and Cenarius was way more powerful than The Lich King. The only thing the Lich King has going for him is the amount of minions he controls, but as far as actual strength in person - it's not that insane.<br />
<br />
But indeed, 10-man / 25-man is a great, but illogical, idea. Nevertheless, I think it's awesome and I look forward to downing The Lich King in a 10-man raid! :D</div></div><hr />

It seems to me though that Blizzard has been cutting on wow development effort for quite some time. Arena focus is one example, heroic/normal mode instances another and the new 10/25 mode still another (not mentioning the &quot;recolor the armor for better results&quot; crap :P).<br />

Disagreed. There are not less instances (in fact there are more) but you can play them in two different difficulty modes as well. So basically there will likely be more 10-man raids and 25-man raids indivudally than there were 10-man and 25-man instances in tBC combined, which is good.<br />
<br />
Same goes for heroics, which didn't even exist pre-tBC. In fact, pre-tBC didn't really have any difficult 5-mans at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It takes less effort in creating 5 dungeons with two separate difficulty modes than to create 10 differing dungeons. I'm not saying that dual difficulty level is bad by itself - it is an obvious and probably intelligent use of resources. <br />
<br />
More instances? BRD alone is probably the size of all TBC 5 man put together (ok, a bit of exaggeration, but not much) - so the number of instances is not all that significant. And we are talking about a game that must be generating several times the revenue it previously was (scale business).<br />
<br />
Personally I thing that Blizzard/Vivendi is milking the cow - and all signs point to that tbqh. <br />
<br />
But that is a bit OT anyway. I just hope that WotLK is far better than the substandard TBC was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, there are two ways of approaching it:<br />
<br />
<br />
Either the encounters are the same and then 10 man is more &quot;hard core&quot;. But the payer number difference is too great to have the encounters the same and not be a walk in the park for 25 man and extremely difficult for 10 man;<br />
<br />
The encounters are different, and the added requirements and coordination difficulty of having 25 man is indeed far above 10 man<br />
<br />
<br />
Simply said, real raids take the larger amount of people. Yep, some even say that real raids are 40 raids, not hte 25 shallow version :P</div></div><hr />

So at level 80, every major encounter and every big boss fight can be experienced with a group of 10.&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost makes me wanna buy WoW again and level up a character. This is fantastic news.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen any raids past karazhan on my main (although completed MH and BT on my brothers account), being a casual, I would have liked to properly see and progress through SSC/TK/MH/BT and all that, but can't/don't want to commit that sort of time to a computer game.<br />
<br />
But this is great news. Yeah the 25 man gear will be better (and rightfully so) but at least casuals will see something more than just 2 or 3 of the expansions raid dungeons.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just saw the video trailer, the expansion is looking amazing. For a game with an old engine, and low polygon/texture count, it looks brilliant. Just goes to show art design &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; technical power.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aikiwoce</div><div class="date">2008-05-09, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just read through the TC/Kalgan interview on curse-gaming, and came up with this tidbit:<br />
<br />
&quot;Potentially like... Legacy Items; we haven't really talked about those in the past. We are planning to do certain types of items that essentially bind to your account, so they're deliberately created as twink items. So you might be able to find one of these items when you're doing an endgame instance, or a raid, or something like that... and you might get an item that binds to your account and can send that off to your other characters, but it does have to stay within your account. So you can deliberately overpower a character to help level up or whatever.&quot;<br />
<br />
Interesting concept, like sending off your old gear to your alt?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rishina</div><div class="date">2008-05-09, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The videos look brilliant! But i'm really not a fan of 10mans. It just seems to go against the very essence of the game. Its a massively multiplayer game. And 10 man raids where you are very very restricted in what you can take are not massively multiplayer. Blizzard doesn't help the matter by making more and more specs raid viable, and by having encounters were you need X player / class or you can't realistically do it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harkkum</div><div class="date">2008-05-09, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great changes as a whole and I really fail to see a reason to start bickering over new options being added. As has been repeatedly pointed out, 10-man instances will have worse loot by a tier level. Thus, taking from Burning Crusade, clearing 10-man Black Temple will yield you rewards level of 25-man Tempest Keep. Seems rather fair to me. Also, no more designing specific 10-man content but instead general raid content that can be accessed by anyone and everyone raiding, not just a set margin. <br />
<br />
And since when it was ruining the game when it is made fun for everyone, and, as a matter of fact, doesn't this go counter all your &quot;welfare epics&quot; arguments as now also 10-man raiders will have progression through natural means and they don't have to rely on artificial badge rewards/BG farming. After all, once you have mastered the entry level instance and gained sufficient gear, you can move on to 1st tier of new raiding instances. Progression, you know. Much like 25-man raiders currently have options with regards to raid difficulty there will also be similar option for those raiding less or with a smaller group of people. And for the true hardcore amidst the people can raid BOTH modes!<br />
<br />
The scenery of the new world was also surprisingly vivid although from time to time it seemed like they were too much relying on old and trusted methods (e.g. that lush Basin). And last but not least, a gnomish assault troops flying to the rescue! Darn, can there be anything more whopping than that. Watch out villains, gnomes are coming (wearing a DK suit!)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katamai</div><div class="date">2008-05-09, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never gotten a welfare epic, and your statement made no sense.<br />
<br />
I suppose when you've got no argument you resort to that sort of gibberish. I was hoping for some argument that required a little more brain power out of you, but then again, you raid and think it takes skill. My bad.<br />
<br />
And you do a FOTM 2v2/3v3/5v5 and think that takes skill?<br />
<br />
Raiding is harder simply for having much more data in the equation. TBC raids are unforgiving and if 1 person screws up, it's game over unless other people are able to recoup for your screwup. You have to rely on TWENTY FOUR more people to perform flawlessly while in arena it's 4 more people tops. That coordination and cooperation is what makes raids harder than sorry excuse for PvP Arena's are. But then again, you think running 2v2 as war/druid (or whatever it FOTM) takes skill and have your epenis enlarged when you &quot;WTFOMGPWN!&quot; a team that had no chance against you simply because their composition/spec was inferior due to how unbalanced game is. <br />
<br />
Arena is by its nature very limited and as scripted as PvE encounters. You know what classes you'll encounter, you know their abilities and how to counter then.<br />
<br />
If you had rank 14 before TBC, then you can preach me how &quot;PvP is hard&quot;, until then stop spewing crap. I had high respect for PvPers of old, Arenas today take no skill, just a favored spec of the season.</div></div><hr />

Frost Presence is okay, since DKs is tanking with 2handers, aka no shield. This presence gives them some more armor + threat buff like palas.<br />

The Anti-Magic Shield is only for one spell... Wouldn't be totally overpowered unless it has a very low CD :P</div></div><hr />

Anti-Magic Shield's cooldown will probably be similar to Spell Reflect, maybe a little less.<br />
<br />
It seems like they are trying to combine warrior-like special abilities with the dps/offtank qualities of a feral druid. I see this making them the quintessential off-tank class. I'll lay odds that they get an ability like Berserker Rage, too.</div></div><hr />

Ye, I was thinking PvP wise. One Aura that really hurts melee, one Aura that really hurts casters. But lets see :)<br />
<br />
Honestly thinking, the one thing I really fear is something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
Now recruiting!<br />
<br />
Death Knight: CLOSED (don't bother applying , queue already miles long)<br />
Druids: High<br />
Hunters: High<br />
Mages: High<br />
Paladins: CLOSED (everyone rerolled, so we decided to manage without them)<br />
Priests: High<br />
Rogues: High<br />
Shamans: Extremely insanely absurdly high (Restos only!)<br />
Warlocks: High<br />
Warriors: High<br />
<br />

<br />
What can I say...<br />
<br />
Lets start with the video. <br />
LMAO Ungoro #2 :D<br />
The skyrail thing... I already forward many use to grief low lvl without flying mount. You land on it, kill them, then &quot;GG, run it again&quot; (if it act like a boat, they will get rezzed at the GY and have to run it all over)<br />
<br />
I love the 10man/25man raid thing. It will be like normal/heroic version of them and it will allow all players to experience the lore content.<br />
<br />
About the DK... anybody else can say OP?<br />
<br />
They have:<br />
- Equivalent of a Holy Shock version unholy<br />
- A get-to-me-bitch ability (like if warrior intercept was not enough annoying like this)<br />
- A root, that will put a snare after it fade and guess what? I am sure they will be able to use it inside (my druid QQ)<br />
- They can instant get a pet and they can sacrifice it to get HP<br />
- A&quot;stance&quot; that will give them bear druid armor but with the DPS of a 2hander (is not that why Mangle(Bear) got nerfed to hell after release of TBC?)<br />
- A &quot;stance&quot; that will make them run faster (PoJ talent) + Bloodlust/Heroism permanent?<br />
- Anti-Magic shield... if it is meant to be used to tank magic-boss (what druids were good at) it means it gonna be on a short cooldown... DK are the new anti-caster (sorry rogues, you lost your spot in PvP :P)<br />
- AoE Deathcoil?!?!?! (well not exactly but AoE damage that can fear? comon and I am sure they wont have to channel it(another moonkin QQ))<br />
<br />
So yeah, if i buy the expension, i will play a DK and praticaly everybody will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That the entire encounter will be either some sort of amusing aside for him, or maybe you reach the final battle only to discover a greater threat (maybe 5 or so Old Gods have broken out of the prison the Titans placed the in) that has you do Arthas' bidding in order to survive, after which you receive your &quot;reward&quot; and are hurled from his throne room to the sound of his mocking laughter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAHAHA, I laughed my ass off so much. Rank 14 takes skill? All you had to do to be Rank 14 was to be unemployed and farm pugs with a team in bg, and agree to who get the rank each week. That's typically a raider mentality, thinking something that only takes time and some dedication is &quot;skill&quot;.<br />
To me skill is reactivity, quick thinking, knowing how to adapt, and especially seeing the whole picture, knowing what the next best move will be, having a move ahead of the enemy, like a midfielder in football (soccer), is it better to do a short pass, long pass, going in yourself, etc.<br />
<br />
PVE is nothing like that, it takes no skill per se, all it takes is discipline, coordination of 25 people, and learning a technique and applying it flawlessly, which is not that easy I'll agree, but it's like: you could set a machine throwing ball in tennis to throw so fast that you can't hit it back, it doesn't mean that if you beat it, you'll be good at tennis. That's what a mob is, it does always ALWAYS the exact same thing. Once you know how to kill a boss, you will always kill that boss if you makes no mistake, while in pvp once you beat a player, he can always think about his loss, and change his strategy to beat you next time.<br />
<br />
Anyway I'm sick of raiders that doesn't have the slightest idea of what pvp is and I'm talking about ANY pvp in any game. It'll always be harder to play against a human, than a piece of script as long as it's set to do always the same.<br />
<br />
And your argument about playing FOTM is stupid, since you think that arena is always FOTM setup vs crappy setup, what about FOTM vs FOTM? Who win then? yes, the one with the most skills will (and some luck, since wow depends a lot on RNG). Everyone play FOTM setups at high ratings anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can you whine after reading this AND watching the video?<br />
<br />
All this info just proves to me WoW is taking a whole new direction for the better.<br />
<br />
1. 10 and 25 mans<br />
<br />
I love Blizzard for doing this... I dont mind the 25 mans having better loot than the 10 mans. But if people knew how hard it is to actually establish a 25 man raiding guild in an old server, they would understand why blizz is doing this. Its not that 25 mans are &quot;harder&quot; they just need more people. Some guilds cant achieve the number of players required for 25 mans for the mere fact that a lot of people are already guilded. They said there will be different versions between 10 and 25 mans...maybe the difference is not just the loot... It could also for example mean both versions have some different bosses but still progression wont be on a standstill... It was so ridiculous how you would move from kara, a 10 man to gruul to then do ZA which was a 10 man... (ZA in kara gear aint a walk in the park :/ ..doable...but not easy...and even so, you cant get the chests with kara gear) so I completely approve with the direction Blizz is taking in PvE, I simply cant wait.<br />
<br />
2. The video<br />
<br />
Simply amazing, the environments are awe-inspiring, as a fan of WC3 as well, I cant wait to set foot in Northrend, and the mounted combat looks fun as hell.<br />
<br />
3. Death Knight<br />
<br />
DK MAY sound overpowered now but just imagine... If death knights are getting these abilities... Just imagine what other classes are getting... I thought the coolest thing about DKs was the rez to turn other players into ghouls, thats just plain awesome, I cant wait to make a Death Knight!<br />
<br />
So in all honesty, I hope all the people saying WoW is failing with WotLK, just quit... go to WAR and see how fail its gonna be...You'll come back...Everyone does :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eldeh</div><div class="date">2008-05-09, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">None of the interviews covered _THE_ most important question of them all. With this new 10 and 25 man versions of all the dungeons, will a player of any class or specc that raids the 25 man version be forced into the 10 man to get an item that is superior to the 25 man version. <br />
This is one of the things I get so aggrivated by in the current state of the game. I.E. one of the best cloaks for hunters drops in Karazhan, seriously what is up with that? <br />
I'd be fine with that the 10 man versions were exactly the same item as the 25 man version, only with less itemlevel, and hence less stats and bonuses. But I have a feeling Blizzard will do like they did ZA and Karazhan, if you can compare those to SSC/TK/MH/BT etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
they already covered that in the interview<br />
<br />
<br />
...At the same time with Karazhan, it [Karazhan] in and of itself was a bit of an experiment to treat a 10-person zone like a full-blown epic raiding zone and see how that could come off. It came off pretty well and was very popular, and then Zul'Aman was an evolution of that. &quot;Ok we did this kind of good entry-level 10-person raid.&quot; People treated it as raiding, came up with strats for fights, got stuck on bosses for a week or two, and I think Zul'Aman really showed we could do pretty elite raiding at that point and pretty hardcore and epic fights. Fighting a major storyline character like Zul'jin and defeating him with 10 people, that it came off ok.<br />
<br />
And then on the flipside of the coin there was a lot of discontent from the 25-person raiding crowd about having to go through Karazhan, having to kill Nightbane. &quot;Hey we're a 25-person raiding guild, that's what we want to do, why are you forcing us to do this other content?&quot; The goal with the 10 and 25 thing is not that we want to have sort of easy mode and that's 10, and then hard mode and that's 25. We really do just want to have two separate, clear progressions. And even within those we want to have easy 10 and 25 raids, and then medium 10 and 25, and hard 10 and 25; we want to have progression through those. <br />
<br />
They are two different types of progression so by that I am assuming the 25 man content will have way better rewards than the 10 man.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Psykhe</div><div class="date">2008-05-09, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One other thing I don't get - what exactly makes 25-mans more &quot;hardcore&quot; and 10-mans less so? If the new raids are the same for both 25 and 10-mans wouldn't they take the same time to clear and learn the fights? <br />
<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
<br />
Two reasons:<br />
<br />
- Organisatorial effort/raid distribution<br />
<br />
It is harder to get a 25 man group together than to get a 10 man group together. Yes, it is very much part of the raid progression. <br />
Also, it is harder to get a &quot;perfect&quot; group with a 25 man than with a 10 man. When an encounter favours a certain class/spec combo it is easier to stack a 10 man group than a 25 man group.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Margin of error<br />
<br />
Quite a lot of bosses have abilities where one player error can wipe the raid. I.e. Archimonde and his soul charges. If you have more players there is a higher chance of one triggering such an abilitzy and causing a wipe.<br />
Lets say, in example, a 5% chance of each player in the raid to make a wipe-causing error during a fight. With 10 players thats around a 60% chance that none of them makes that error (0.95^10). With 25 players thats only a 28% chance (0.95^25).<br />
<br />
So, if the 25 man and 10 man would really be the same (exept stuff like the mob HPs for obvious reasons) then the 25 man versions would require about twice as many attempts on average with an equal skilllvl.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not that they will be the same, mind you. Partly because of the reason described above, but also partly because of other reasons. You can design more complex encounters with 25 man raids (Compare the complexity of vanshji or kael with stuff like prince or ZJ. And thats not (only) because they are higher tier. You simply cannot translate the vashji and kael encounter to 10 man without reducing their complexity) and 25 mans can be designed with the assumption that every class is present in the raid (buffs, abilities, etc) while for a 10 man this isn't something you can count on.</div></div><hr />

I don't see the logic in lurking in forums dedicated to a game you quit but okay :/<br />
<br />
The 10 and 25 man versions are a fine way for people to actually see the content Blizz has made for the game... Its obvious both encounters (the 10 and 25 man) wont be the same at all, just because of the raid composition and the level of difficulty behind it... And death knights...It will be just like when BC came out... a million BE pallies and a million Draenei shaman...not everyone actually levels a character to max level, so im sure the amount of death knights in the game will decrease after a couple of months...</div></div><hr />

If it isn't unique gear then why wouldn't someone just do 10-mans? Why would it be tougher? Coordination is a non-factor when you have a strong core of players you've been playing with for months. I have a feeling Blizzard just plans on increasing the HP/Damage of encounter and the stats of gear for the 25-mans.<br />
<br />
Superior in what way though? Different designs? Or the &quot;Blizzard&quot; way of doing it - a different shade of color on the same rehashed sets that will likely be given out via Arena AND 10-mans.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have you ever done heroics? There are lots of fights in heroics that are different than the same boss on regular, with added abilities etc., and that is just still for 5 people. I would be that the 25 man encounters are going to be much more difficult than just &quot;added hitpoints and damage&quot;. However, even if the gear in 25 mans is superior, they had better NOT just recolor it from the 10 mans, especially since the &quot;tier&quot; gear is achieved from the 25 mans. The tier gear should look super awesome and the 10 man gear should look like the same level that kara gear appears imo.</div></div><hr />

For the same reason theres abolish poison. You rolled the class that gets to dispel EVERYTHING, you can't have the over-time dispel as well ;p <br />

<br />
Actually what will be needed is abolish disease which only priests can use, which only removes 1 disease every 5 seconds and will most likely be dispelled before it has a chance to remove a second disease.</div></div><hr />

The environments and bestiary are the most difficult and time consuming things to create. Assuming they are still 6 months away from release I'd say it's highly possible.

not that I have a problem with it, i love raiding 10 mans much more than 25 mans, and only could do 25 man raids by essentially breaking up my closely knit 10 man group. this sounds like an awesome way for 10 man guilds to see new content, and 25 man guilds to be able to (rightfully) get better gear for achieving larger goals. I only wish it wasn't the same gear, recolored tho. <br />

This is one of the things I get so aggrivated by in the current state of the game. I.E. one of the best cloaks for hunters drops in Karazhan, seriously what is up with that? <br />
I'd be fine with that the 10 man versions were exactly the same item as the 25 man version, only with less itemlevel, and hence less stats and bonuses. But I have a feeling Blizzard will do like they did ZA and Karazhan, if you can compare those to SSC/TK/MH/BT etc.<br />

And we are talking about a game that must be generating several times the revenue it previously was (scale business).<br />
<br />
Blackrock depths was originally a ten man raid with 5man content, just like blackrock spire (LBRS is meant to be run by only five people, hence why it's the easiest raid in the game). It was turned into a five man somewhere around version 1.8 when BWL came online. This is why it's so huge, it's meant to be handled in stages, and parts of it weren't intended for five man groups.<br />
<br />
To this day there's parts of BRD I've never seen. Just like how I've never been in BWL or Naxx.</div></div><hr />

If I do recall, there's going to be another hero class. It was an old curse article. I mean Blizz said that they are going to have the Arch Druid as another hero class in this expansion. I'd love to see this class as well and how it'll 'counter' the dark heroic class of the DK.<br />

Blizzard has already stated that they're not doing any major graphics update to the game just because of the MAJORITY of the player base are casual gamers, which means that not everybody has end game computers. Yes, upgrading to top engines around this time might seen good for you if you have good computer but for blizzard, upgrading would mean losing thousands if not MILLIONS of players.<br />

The reason for WoW being so massive (and the success of other Blizzard games) is due to how you can play it on low end systems. Don't expect graphics like Warhammer or Age of Conans in WoW.<br />

<br />
&quot;Like something from the late 1990s now&quot;.... so it was from the year 2004 on release but it's actually got backwards? Get tired of comments like that, sorry. The graphics are absolutely fine as Blizzard's art design has always been far superior to most developers. They can really take relatively simple models and put top notch and well thought out textures on top to make them really stand out and be impressive. I much rather look at WoW for hours than many many games out there that are considered great graphics.<br />
<br />
As for the expansion gameplay wise. I like the 10-man/25-man idea a lot. As long as the 25-man raids are properly awarded for their extra need in coordination with the scaling to 15 more people. I'll likely be a 25-man raider as I always want to do the hardest challenges a game as to offer, just me. I personally would much rather have this type of system over the current Badge system... MUCH more so. You still must raid for gear but it's much easier to get the right group, etc. Works well, hope this means Blizzard removes badges.</div></div><hr />

What? Stop recruiting bad people then. My guild seems to some how function without tons of class leaders and only two &quot;real&quot; leaders. They simply have the power.

Its not about farming gear. I think thats where the disconnect is for the folks that don't like the new rules. Small guilds want to keep their identity and personality in tact while not having to deal with the logistics of getting 25 people from point A to point B. <br />

You can have an &quot;identity&quot; with 25-man raiding guilds. My guild has had a strong core for the past 2-3 months and we've been rolling through BT content with ease.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daedalon</div><div class="date">2008-05-09, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you would raid a 10 man version of BT now for T5 with fights slightly less difficult over doing 25 man BT for T6? Okay. <br />
<br />
<br />
I dont think you have thought this to end. Your version of this is that T7 is 10 man then and tier 8 is 25 man. Then comes next raidcontent that has T8 10 man and T9 25 man ? Now we get the raiders &quot;selling&quot; runs for 10 mans to ? <br />
<br />
Or... look at it this way - 10 man is crap compared to 25 man ? Effort is same and loot is worse ? <br />
<br />
Another version would have new tiers for every new 10 man and 25 man. That would lead to how many burnouts doing the same instance not just once per week but two times - Having to do the 10 man to gear up for the 25 man.<br />
<br />
Simply put - this has not been thought trough at all. Any way you look at it this can not be compared to heroic instancing. Why ? Because it had the same number of players going for it.<br />
<br />
My version of giving more ppl chance to enjoy the content was to start with 25 man instance that will become 10 man (none heroic) when next 25 man instance gets out. That is not hard to do lore wise. You make some artifact that reduces the Powers of the bosses in the old instance. The battle moves to new front. <br />
<br />
It leads to exactly the same result allowing more ppl to enjoy the content. Same items just tier lower - just like you are implying.</div></div><hr />

You don't get it. People in 25 man guilds all know each other still. We all have a great time on vent during raids. We all laugh in guild chat. We all help each other with farming, questing, and other in game activities. You seem to think that being in a 25-man raid guild means you know no one, everyone is just there for the gear, etc. It's so far from the truth it's a joke. Maybe that's why your guild had such troubles, you didn't have a clue that the only thing that changes is a few more members and the instance.</div></div><hr />

Its still alot easier to do 25 man than 40. But thing is - u rely more on those 25 to be there than you did on the 40. Now if we go 10 man u rely more on them than 25. Considering they all need to be the right class and spec to finish the content. Its the same thing. <br />
<br />
What basicly is happening is that Blizzard is moving away from PVE into easy to make PVP. THey are making raids less and less part of the endgame. Not because ppl dont like raiding. Just because they have to make the content. Its alot cheaper for them to throw new items into same Arenas while they get payed for it. <br />
<br />
All in all - we are seeing one more washdown of WOW. PVP down to one man content for endgame rewards ? Hell why not - it would be populare for the OP classes.</div></div><hr />

More instances? BRD alone is probably the size of all TBC 5 man put together (ok, a bit of exaggeration, but not much) - so the number of instances is not all that significant. And we are talking about a game that must be generating several times the revenue it previously was (scale business).<br />
<br />
Personally I thing that Blizzard/Vivendi is milking the cow - and all signs point to that tbqh. <br />
<br />
But that is a bit OT anyway. I just hope that WotLK is far better than the substandard TBC was.<br />

<br />
Yeah, but BRD was the most boring drawn out crap ever. If i had to think of one instance that could make me fall asleep with a car battery attatched to my nipples and my feet in a tank of hungry piranhas, and my hair on fire, it would be BRD. Holy GOD what a boring instance.</div></div><hr />

What? I'm sorry but that makes no sense at all. The 25 man content is still just as complex and time consuming to create as the old world 40 man content was. It's simply much less demanding on the guild leader when it comes to get the amount of people to play. The work done by Blizzard is literally the same. Also, now with 10/25 mans being done in the same instance that instance must function correctly with BOTH of those setups. That means much testing, the fights might need to be tweaked causing the potential for bugs to rise. The design and layout of the instance must also be highly considerate of both setups. Maybe you think in game development size = cost but its far from the truth. The more expandable something is and the variety of uses it'll experience is what increases cost.<br />
<br />
You'll also notice in none of these WotLK updates today has there been a single mention of Arena PvP. Instead an entire Zone is dedicated that is tasking Blizzard with the job of adding many aspects to their game engine. That is literally one of the most difficult and time consuming options they could have gone with. Adding the physics to the engine needed for this Zone alone is massive. Yes, its PvP but its an entirely new and exciting method of PvP for WoW. It's also the farthest from lazy they could have gone with.<br />
<br />
Then your final comment really has me cracking up. It is not in Blizzards interest to have a class dominating PvP. Funny how these &quot;They make their own classes OP&quot; and &quot;They just do it for the money&quot; ideas directly clash against each other. By pissing off other classes you hurt your monthly income as they might give the game up till their class is up to par with the others. So its directly in Blizzard &quot;money&quot; interest to make all classes fair and fun to play.</div></div><hr />

Its alot cheaper to reuse the same bosses for 10 man instances than make new 10 mans. We got 2 unique 10 mans in BC. We get zero in WOTLK ? And how many raiding instances in total ? My bet is 3.<br />

There is no need to talk about Arena is there ? Its the same areas with Endgame rewards. As in terms of their &quot;massive&quot; PVP zone. Whats the rewards gonna be ? None ? Then the reason for playing it is as much as playing current world PVP capture the tower. In other words.. Pointless. WoW does not reward ppl to work together in numbers. It rewards ppl playing in low numbers in unbalanced content. <br />
<br />

<br />
Still they are creating a PVP system that benefits some classes and specs over others. Tanking rewards in PVP Arena have any meaning ? &quot;They make their own classes OP&quot; and &quot;They just do it for the money&quot; are still fully valid. What you dont see is that they can't balance it -even if they wanted to. So instead of actually doing it they think of it from their class and they water it down to make more money without thinking longterm. Longterm benefits of PVP system would have been to create BG and then make it part of the PVP endgame rewards ingame. Blizzard did not and that leads to totally diffrent game. Part of the game that directly supports tanking aspect of PVP is worth zero now. There would be easy to implement balance by adding BG rewards but - hey.. they didn't. <br />
<br />
Cause their system is not balancing it on its own. It all ends up with buffing and nerfing - instead of actually making content where one class doesn't have 100% Dmg specs (like warriors for example) in PVP and thinking it has no effect in the long term game balance. Considering it costs gold to respec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Im not sure you quite understand the basics of human behavior. It's easy to explain really... ppl will always go the easiest way. That applies to MMO games to. In terms of WoW - lets put it this way. There are more 2 man PVP teams than there are 5 man pvp teams. Cause its easier to get 1 person to play with you rather than 4. And it gives same rewards. <br />
<br />
Cheating works exactly the same way - It was easier to AFK bgs than actually play them to get free arena gear. So ppl did that.<br />
<br />
What will now happen is either. 10 man instancing will be easier and rewarding more compared to the effort of doing it 25 man. This is the most likely scenario. The other is that 25 man content will be rewarding ppl to much compared to 10 man. What we can be sure of is that there will be no balance on this from BLizzard. Just like there is now no balance in terms of effort and rewards in endgame BC PVP and PVE the same will happen in raiding. <br />
<br />
And in terms of Blizzard balancing the game.. They made it even more impossible. Now every spec of every class needs to be balanaced for 2v2, 3v3, 5v5 arena - Bgs and world PVP and... lvling - 5 man - 10 man and 25 man group content. Not to mention that all encounters need to be made with the thinking not supporting one type of spec or class over another.<br />
<br />
Or... are we gonna be talking about PVP classes and PVE classes ? That is most likely to happen.<br />
<br />
What we can be sure of is that Blizzard is taking the game further and futher away from the basic thinking of MMOs. Instead of letting the players control the balance they have to do it all themselfs. That can not work cause noone ever can. In other words. Things will just get worse.<br />
<br />
What noone is actually mentioning is that Blizzard is cheating some raiders out of fresh content. Players that are doing 25 man content did 10 man content to. BOth Kara and ZA. Now what BLizzard is offering those is same content with diffrent number of ppl. Exiting isn't it ?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazorp</div><div class="date">2008-05-09, 11:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're the one who brought up arena even though it was nowhere on today's WotLK announcements. You're also assuming that the new PvP Zone will have no rewards which is likely extremely far from the truth. It'll likely have many daily quests/objectives in order to increase the amount of honor you can gain. Look at how they added that to the world PvP areas already. There is no reason why they wouldn't logically extend this on to WolLK.<br />
<br />
You're also assuming that Blizzard is out to rip you off. Seriously, what makes you so concerned about them doing this? TBC has SEVEN 25 man areas with FIVE of those being FULL instances with many encounters. On top of that it has two 10 man instances. While there's little reason to believe WotLK will launch with that many its pretty safe to assume it'll arrive to similar amounts itself. Nothing so far has shown to be otherwise. The 10-man/25-man mechanic doesn't have to be some evil way for Blizzard to hurt you like you treat it. It's simply a great way for them to concentrate effort on making the encounters the best possible, being epic, well tuned, little bugs, and fun.<br />
<br />
As for PvP balance. It's been a very progressive state since TBC launch. Maybe you've forgot Season 1 but the only truly dominate class from that still owning face is Warrior. Since then a new flavor of the month has appeared constantly with each new patch. Not because of major balance changes but because people try new things and see that they work. Many of the very popular current comps came out with experimentation.<br />

They did explain this with how the 10 man version gives lesser gear. It be like for example the 10 man version of BT dropping tier 5 while the 25 man drops T6.<br />

The F&amp;F Alpha is likely close yes but the beta is likely still a ways off. The F&amp;F Alpha will last about 2 months. Its possible the beta may begin after the WWI at the end of June.</div></div><hr />

1. They haven't revealed new abilities for the existing classes yet.<br />
2. If you want a spot in a raiding guild as a DK you're going to want to be bloody good at your job.<br />
3. No doubt DK won't be the only one they release....ONE Hero Class for each expansion?? Yeah right.<br />
<br />
25 Manz are teh Nerfed! Ima doin' 10 manz!<br />
<br />
When has anyone said that from Blizzard? I will hazard a guess and say that the loot tables for 10 man versions will be akin to doing something like Sunwell Heroic Kael compared to TK Kael. i.e. the 10 man will drop some nice pieces, but it won't be tier, and neither will it be re-couloured T7/8/9.<br />
<br />
For those saying '25 man raids have no identity', you're wrong. Blizaard have repeatedly said they have no plans to change the current format as being the optimal raid experience, and the loot will no doubt reflect that. For everyone who wants to progress (i.e. hard/semi-hardcore guilds) 25 mans will still be the measuring stick. Therefore, 10 man versions will be nice, but they won't replace the current model.<br />
<br />
Other thoughts<br />
1. New ZA/ZG looks cool...very undead troll looking with lots of spiders etc....<br />
2. New landscape effects look great,<br />
3. Looks like most buildings are on a grander scale (i.e. towns etc)<br />
4. Oozes atmosphere....<br />
<br />
Oh and for all the 'PvP will be unbalanced'....since when did every class in this game have the right to expect they should kill every other class just as easy as the next one? Classes will NEVER be balanced. <br />
<br />
It used to be so easy to sit back and knock Blizz, hell I used to do it. But just deal with the fact that it is going to be a great expansion, a great gaming experience and that you're ultimately dealing with fictional characters fighting Interrnet monsters. Let's just have fun....can't wait to throw the obligitory sickie during the release week!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raiding is harder simply for having much more data in the equation. TBC raids are unforgiving and if 1 person screws up, it's game over unless other people are able to recoup for your screwup. You have to rely on TWENTY FOUR more people to perform flawlessly while in arena it's 4 more people tops. That coordination and cooperation is what makes raids harder than sorry excuse for PvP Arena's are. But then again, you think running 2v2 as war/druid (or whatever it FOTM) takes skill and have your epenis enlarged when you &quot;WTFOMGPWN!&quot; a team that had no chance against you simply because their composition/spec was inferior due to how unbalanced game is. <br />
<br />
Arena is by its nature very limited and as scripted as PvE encounters. You know what classes you'll encounter, you know their abilities and how to counter then.<br />
<br />
If you had rank 14 before TBC, then you can preach me how &quot;PvP is hard&quot;, until then stop spewing crap. I had high respect for PvPers of old, Arenas today take no skill, just a favored spec of the season.<br />

While the difficulty of the endeavour varies largely from server to server creating a steady core of players of the right classes and builts and having enough additional players of sufficient skill to regularly and succesfully raid 25-man content is in itself harder than actually defeating said content, at least as far as TBC is concerned. If you have 25 skilled people who can make a good raid on every night you raid (or day, whatever rocks your boat) you will achieve progress and have fun. Getting those people is harder than defeating the raid. Meanwhile when defeating raid content is a fun procedure, building and maintaining a raid guild hardly ever is. It is an often thankless job to be sincere. Allowing dedicated and skill players to experience raid content with just the 12-14 other people that are equally dedicated and skilled as they and not forcing them to babysit and train the newer players in the everchanging roster of a raid guild will make the game fun again for those of us who have been struggling through content alongside a good number of friends simply because we started late, we lost several members because of real life reasons, or whatever else keeps guilds with strong cores from progressing. I for one do not care for the best gear (though I would not mind it looking nice for once); I care for experiencing content. I just hope that 10-man versions are as hard as they can possibly be. They will inevitably be easier than the 25-man versions (for with 25 people the encounters can be made more complex, they can be designed with the concept that all classes are present, and the margin of error raidwide is larger) and noone will consider server or even world firsts in 10mans any serious accomplishment, but as long as they can challenge a group of players that is appropriately geared for them, many people will rejoice. And those that actually do run 25-man versions will still get better loot, will likely have a larger number of friendly guild members, and will enjoy the actual prestige of raiding accomplishment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many guilds will thrive again as guilds will be able to select superiour players from 10 man guilds with great gear. More people will play pve and thus recruiting will be easier.<br />
<br />
It will be easier TO JOIN A 25 MAN GUILD. I don't have the gear or time to join a 25 man guild in TBC. All good guilds are full anyway. I can only run kara to gear up and then u already need 25 mans to improve gearwise.<br />
<br />
10 mans will probably not be very easy, karazhan was very hard with starting gear when it came out. It will not be easy to just storm through it unless your very good guild.<br />
<br />
The way i see it:<br />
<br />
Casuals will progress through 10 mans and hardcore raiders can use it to gear up. Or recruit new players.<br />
25 man raids will progress faster through content sucking fresh blood from 10 man raiders. Players who complete ten man raids the fastest will get selected for 25 mans if they wish. It will be easier to find good geared players and 25 man guilds will thrive.<br />
<br />
Thirdly good 10 man guilds will also run 25 man raids for a better challenge and try to down some first bosses to also progess faster in 10 man content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every pvp season stats are slighty different and thus people go crazy and still want that new gear, thus every decent player will always want to be running 25 mans. The best players will be running around in the latest tier from 25 raids,very good players will be running around in a tier less from 10 man guilds. <br />
<br />
Nothing much will change besides alot more playing wearing decent pve gear, more geared players means also easier recruiting. Life will be good for casuals as hardcore!</div></div><hr />

The idea that 10 people can experience the same content that 25 man raids can, though, is just a bad idea in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I'll withold my final opinion till I can hear more about how 10mans progress vs 25s, but from what I can speculate, 10mans are going to be faster, easier version. You can say they'll make 10mans harder, but the simple truth that 10 people are a hell of alot easier to recruit and gear, then 25 people. is hard to ignore. I can only assume that 10 man raids will be seeing new content sooner then 25man raids because of this.<br />
<br />
I hope Blizzard has some clever way of deterring 10man raids from having faster progression. That is... Something other then ridiculous gear checks, like Brutalis, for example.<br />
<br />
<br />
And ya, take resil out of the game, make pve worthwhile. At this point, seeing content is the only benifit to progression. Wasn't it fun when bragging about downing a boss wasn't the only thing you could do with gear?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets do this little scenario:<br />
<br />
Guild A that is an established 25man raiding guild, has killed Kil'jaeden and has proven they know their raiding. <br />
Guild B is a casual-ish guild that also did 25mans but due to numbers issues(as they would like to say, but possibly due to commitment/learning curve) could not progress past SSC/TK and resorted to basing much of their raiding around 10mans.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both guilds are leveled to 80 and ready to roll for when a new instance is released.<br />
<br />
Guild A heads heavy for the 25man, does well, downs the bosses(lets say at a rate of 1 boss every 2 nights)<br />
Guild B heads heavy for the 10 man, does well, downs the bosses(lets say at a rat of 1 boss every night)<br />
<br />
The issue i have here, is that from what will be less effort(half the time), the boss at the end of the instance(establishing rankings of guilds ect) was downed first in a 10 man. Gaurentee it will work that way if they are releasing both 10man and 25 man mode at the same time. <br />
<br />
In response to the &quot;25man will always be seen as the 'real raid'&quot; i agree, and disagree. Many people raid to see the content, to experience the fights and see what happens with the lore while defeating a boss with their friends. When a 10 man instance can offer the exact same benefits, with less effort, at only the cost of getting lower stats on their gear(as we've already established is only a means to see new content and a slight perk from graphics) then raiding desire will literally go down the tubes. The gear will have the same models, only different colors. And yes, i do believe the fact that you are no longer distinguised for your efforts in &quot;end-game raiding&quot; it WILL diminish the number of people that will raid since.... well.... lets face it, theres just less and less reason to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
5 man arenas were supposed to be the most rewarding Arena fights. Still its the least played content in PVP. Why you think that is ? Secondly. 10 man instances are not easier than 25 mans. In fact they are in many case harder cause you have less freedom on the setup. <br />
<br />
You can not compare 10 man BC and WOLK cause its gonna be the same raids now. Its gonna be heavily gear dependant like always. Is 25 man gonna be doable without getting the 10 man outfit first ? Or will players have to do the 25 man content to open the 10 mans ? Has not yet been desided. <br />
<br />
What dissapoints me the most is that Blizzard stated they could not make the epic 40 man instances into 10 mans before BC. Now they are doing so in Naxramas. And they are making miniversions of the 25 man content. <br />
<br />
There are alot of issues with this system. Just like with every system that is made. The question is how many issues will there be ? That yet again depends on balancing from Blizzard. That means what ? Longer testing times - content is further apart and in the end - less content released. WOTLK is still 6-8 months away and now the whole game is heavily dependant on perfect balance. One bad patch and it will all crumble. The systems are no longer selfsupporting if things go wrong. Not to mention they are so tied together now that its almost impossible to predict the outcome. But the likelyhood of failure is rising all the time.</div></div><hr />

Compared to the hardware they require, WoW graphics are amazing. If they improved the graphics greatly which I am sure they have the tech and experience to manage, they would need to up their hardware reqs. And low reqs is the most important reason for WoW's massive success and population. They would loose so many subscribers so fast, then the game would collapse because they would no longer have the cash flow to keep it up. WoW is a self-sustaining success, the bigger it gets the more money it needs to keep going, and if they ever suffered a sudden loss on subscribers they'd be in a less than enviable situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats what really dissapoints me. The current graphix of WOW are able to take MMOs into new lvls. A real MMO fights with massive number of players fighting each other. But Blizzard did exactly the oposite. THey are taking the PVP down to 2v2 and PVE down to 10 man. Thats just sad. WoW WOTLK could have been something like WAR is aiming for. Or it should have. I would have loved to see WOLK with one major city that is fought over by Horde and the alliance. But guess what ? ... There is no balance .. And you wonder why ? Simply because from start Blizzard has been unable to create any system in WOW that is selfsupporting. All they aim for is maximum income. WoW is not MMO anymore - its a joke of a game based on something totally diffrent. <br />
<br />
Balance is key to any MMO. And to keep balance you create system that maintains it. Blizzard sold their balance for Character transfers and 2v2 PVP. Its kinda funny that a person that took Ultima Online down to nothing - and two ex EQ players that were banned from the game cause of their actions are in charge of the balance of WoW. But it kinda says it all. It is a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play for...<br />
<br />
1) Experiencing new content<br />
2) Lore<br />
3) Having semi-rare gear and being a *pretty little butterfly*<br />
<br />
My whole point is if 10-mans give you everything a 25-man does I see no reason to do 25-mans at this point and I feel like alot of people will come to the same conclusion. Comparing heroic versions to regular 5-mans isn't a valid argument - Heroics provide unique loot tables with totally different looking gear. If Blizzard throws the same loot tables in 10 and 25 mans with only added stats it will be useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, i usually don't trash tralk, but comeon... IF you are of that believe, that 10-man and 25-man will NOT have any obvious differences, you are really mistaken... I don't KNOW this, but after blizzards 3 years of experience, They know what we wan't as a majority, as raiders... By making both 10-man and 25-man, they have given us even more.. Before, when they released new 25 man dungeons, those where unique for 4-6 guilds pr. server... This meaning, that the majority of this server, will never really enjoy this expansion... But, but but... If you look at the success of ZG and &quot;recently&quot; ZA, these have been major alternatives for 20 man raiding Pre-tbc / 10 man raiding TBC.. And, the difference between the loot tables, has ALWAYS been different.. Different levels, different looks... It doesn't take a scientist to know, that blizzard always make the looks of a item, depend on the looks of a boss / istance..<br />
<br />
And furthermore... You talk about no reason to do 25 man, when you can experience the same in 10 man.. Ofc, it doesnt take a morron to figure that the loot will be better, we all know this.. But indeed, the bosses functions will be more different.. Doing a boss in 10 man, might give you an idea of how the boss works in 25 man, but it's certainly not at the same level of difficulty.. Just think of Kael in The eye, compared to Kael in MgT... Yes, alot of the same mechanics in the encounters, but they are no way near the same level of difficulty, nore is the reward anywhere near eachother...<br />
<br />
So don't specculate wether 10 man would be just as satisfying as 25 man.. If you keep in mind, that blizzard has 3 years of experience, Then such a statement, is just plain dumb...</div></div><hr />

Rank 14 takes skill? All you had to do to be Rank 14 was to be unemployed and farm pugs with a team in bg, and agree to who get the rank each week. That's typically a raider mentality, thinking something that only takes time and some dedication is &quot;skill&quot;.<br />
To me skill is reactivity, quick thinking, knowing how to adapt, and especially seeing the whole picture, knowing what the next best move will be, having a move ahead of the enemy, like a midfielder in football (soccer), is it better to do a short pass, long pass, going in yourself, etc.<br />
<br />
PVE is nothing like that, it takes no skill per se, all it takes is discipline, coordination of 25 people, and learning a technique and applying it flawlessly, which is not that easy I'll agree, but it's like: you could set a machine throwing ball in tennis to throw so fast that you can't hit it back, it doesn't mean that if you beat it, you'll be good at tennis. That's what a mob is, it does always ALWAYS the exact same thing. Once you know how to kill a boss, you will always kill that boss if you makes no mistake, while in pvp once you beat a player, he can always think about his loss, and change his strategy to beat you next time.<br />
<br />
Anyway I'm sick of raiders that doesn't have the slightest idea of what pvp is and I'm talking about ANY pvp in any game. It'll always be harder to play against a human, than a piece of script as long as it's set to do always the same.<br />
<br />
And your argument about playing FOTM is stupid, since you think that arena is always FOTM setup vs crappy setup, what about FOTM vs FOTM? Who win then? yes, the one with the most skills will (and some luck, since wow depends a lot on RNG). Everyone play FOTM setups at high ratings anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
100% Disagree...</div></div><hr />

<br />
How can you whine after reading this AND watching the video?<br />
<br />
All this info just proves to me WoW is taking a whole new direction for the better.<br />
<br />
1. 10 and 25 mans<br />
<br />
I love Blizzard for doing this... I dont mind the 25 mans having better loot than the 10 mans. But if people knew how hard it is to actually establish a 25 man raiding guild in an old server, they would understand why blizz is doing this. Its not that 25 mans are &quot;harder&quot; they just need more people. Some guilds cant achieve the number of players required for 25 mans for the mere fact that a lot of people are already guilded. They said there will be different versions between 10 and 25 mans...maybe the difference is not just the loot... It could also for example mean both versions have some different bosses but still progression wont be on a standstill... It was so ridiculous how you would move from kara, a 10 man to gruul to then do ZA which was a 10 man... (ZA in kara gear aint a walk in the park :/ ..doable...but not easy...and even so, you cant get the chests with kara gear) so I completely approve with the direction Blizz is taking in PvE, I simply cant wait.<br />
<br />
2. The video<br />
<br />
Simply amazing, the environments are awe-inspiring, as a fan of WC3 as well, I cant wait to set foot in Northrend, and the mounted combat looks fun as hell.<br />
<br />
3. Death Knight<br />
<br />
DK MAY sound overpowered now but just imagine... If death knights are getting these abilities... Just imagine what other classes are getting... I thought the coolest thing about DKs was the rez to turn other players into ghouls, thats just plain awesome, I cant wait to make a Death Knight!<br />
<br />
So in all honesty, I hope all the people saying WoW is failing with WotLK, just quit... go to WAR and see how fail its gonna be...You'll come back...Everyone does :P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Very well said... Nice too see others with open minds about this :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gandorr</div><div class="date">2008-07-02, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank God I have quit the game :P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
O rly?? Staying around to troll the forums, reading updates about WotLK... I wouldn't call that a former player... Actually, you are seeking more info, than a lot of the current players... <br />
<br />
Maybe you should just face it, Wow is inevitable... And not even YOU can resist :P</div></div><hr />

How much raiding do you have under your belt? I see no difference in the amount of &quot;skill&quot; needed to pvp then dealing with the randomness of council for 10 min strait in a fight for survival through awareness on a player level. There’s dozens of ways to die and it only takes one dumb move. Also to most Archimonde is considered the hardest boss in game because its unforgiving and the survival of the raid is based on the player as a individual. Further more last patch the fires got buffed to be even more random. It’s a different kind of skill but none the less its skill.<br />
<br />
Let me inform you that many serious raiders pvp and view it as a side game. /shocking</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Protoluz</div><div class="date">2008-07-02, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still cannot understand why you guys are still fighting over the same argument...<br />
<br />
PvPers Once you have learned to kill xyz class u do the same to the next person of that xyz, and so on and on. In away you become scripted because nothing changes.<br />
But you still require skill and knowledge of your xyz opponent to counter his moves. <br />
<br />
PvE also requires skill yes its the same scripted stuff over and over again but it still requires the 10/25 members of the raid to pay attention because like one said 1 dumb/silly mistake could wipe the whole raid, just like pvp arena if u/partner/member makes a mistake it could cause the team to lose.<br />
<br />
Conclusion Both pvp and pve requires different kind of skills, they are both scripted. Each have there good and bad points, but there is no need to disrespect those that choose to pvp/pve after all they are the ones paying their subscription.<br />
<br />
Please stop arguing about this, its almost brought up in every single post these days.<br />
<br />

Really old thread, should have looked for an answer elsewhere. Hero is in reference to the fact that Death Knight was a &quot;hero class&quot; of Warcraft III.</div></div><hr />
