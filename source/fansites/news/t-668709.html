<br />
WoW Cataclysm Features - The Abyssal Maw<br />
Azeroth's native elementals wreaked havoc across the world while they were under the influence of the Old Gods.<br />
<br />
To keep Azeroth safe from these threats, the titans imprisoned the Old Gods underground and banished the savage elementals to the titan-constructed Elemental Plane, a secure dominion where the elementals could dwell without harming Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Four domains were created within this primordial realm to serve as ideal environments for each type of elemental. For ages since, the elementals of air, water, earth, and fire have engaged in endless strife with each other, waging titanic battles in the confines of their realm. One of the Elemental Plane's domains, a vast ocean known as the Abyssal Maw, is home to the water elementals. Legend says that Neptulon the Tidehunter, the powerful being who rules over the aquatic realm, possesses a potent weapon that allows its owner to control the very seas of Azeroth. Thus far, the artifact has remained secure inside the water elementals' domain... but that will soon change.<br />
<br />
Within Deepholm, the domain of the earth elementals, the malefic Dragon Aspect Deathwing is on the verge of executing a catastrophic act: to burst forth from the Elemental Plane into Azeroth. Doing so will ravage the surface of the world and breach the barrier that separates Azeroth from the elementals' realm. Whether Neptulon and his subjects have entered into an alliance with Deathwing remains unknown. Regardless, if Deathwing's actions create an opening into the Abyssal Maw, nefarious and honorable factions alike will seek out the fabled weapon carried by Neptulon. Whoever secures the artifact will have control over the world's seas, a power that perhaps no one, not even members of the Horde or the Alliance, should possess.<br />

Runescroll of Brilliance removed from 3.2.2 PTRs<br />
We felt that the near-mandatory buffs were Fort, Kings and perhaps Gift. It may be very hard to do say a 10-player heroic without those buffs.<br />
<br />
Once you get into Arcane Int then you have to start thinking about Spirit and Shadow Protection and whatever. We didn't want to create a dozen or more new scrolls. And honestly, we'd rather you have players than scrolls. But we recognize that you don't always have that much flexibility in a 10-player run.

Reasons behind the &quot;killing&quot; of 2v2 Arenas<br />
One, the 2s comp tended to reward sticking the most abilities into one class. Really well-rounded classes with lots of offense and defense tended to dominate simply because you have fewer people in which to package everything you need.<br />
<br />
Two, there has to be a point at which you balance healers. If a healer can keep themselves and one other player alive, then they are hopeless in 3s. If a healer can keep themselves and two other players alive, then they are overpowered in 2s. (By the time you get to 5s, we think other factors come into play so it matters less that the dps to healer ratio is the same.)<br />
<br />
Three, we just think the larger matches are more fun overall and we think we can offer a better game experience by focusing on them. If you just love 2s, well, they're still around. They just don't offer the best rewards so perhaps the players most focused on balance won't obsess with two vs. two balance. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19820635563-official-reason-for-killing-2v2.html))<br />
<br />
Avoidance in Cataclysm<br />
We're not ready to talk about it yet. However, keep a couple of things in mind:<br />
<br />
If your avoidance is 20% in say the second raid tier, then it might be 10% or less when you're running your first heroic at 85. Ugh.<br />
If on the other hand, your avoidance is closer to 15% at 85, then the diminishing returns going from 15% to 20% are going to be so brutal that players might just give up and use other stats.<br />
If avoidance is 20% in both the first tier and last tier, then you also have DR problems and in fact don't really feel like you are improving by acquiring more gear at all. <br />
<br />
Why the Avoidance problem wasn't fixed between Sunwell and WotLK<br />
Heh. No, we actually did. The problem is we made three changes that undid some of that effort. (These affected all rating and stat inflation, not just tanks.)<br />
<br />
1) We added glyphs, which just inflated player power for almost no cost.<br />
2) We improved a lot of talents. For tanks, Prot and Prot became more streamlined, allowing you to get more survivability at much less cost. (Remember when Anticipation was defense?)<br />
3) We jumped the item level more than we originally intended in order to provide a nice jump from blues to Naxx and particularly to offer hard modes in Ulduar and beyond. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19820323342-tank-balance-and-encounter-design.html))<br />
<br />
Balancing healing and tank survavibility in PvE<br />
In order to make encounters scary (esp. hard modes) there needs to be a real threat of tanks dying. That threat does not always need to be a threat of dying in one hit obviously. However, any situation that lets tanks not take a lot of damage can make the fights feel very easy or in fact make them very easy -- you can analyze incoming damage and guesstimate whether you're going to live or die. On the other hand, any situation where the tank is at a risk of dying then feels like it is punishing the healers.<br />
<br />
(I'll also add that I don't think the solution is just to give tanks so many cooldowns and debuffs that they have ultimate control over whether they live or die -- it's supposed to be a group effort and we want tanks to feel sturdy without feeling too self-sufficient.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19820323342-tank-balance-and-encounter-design.html))<br />
<br />
Is raiding easier in WotLK?<br />
Hmmm. This sounds a bit like elitist chest-thumping, but I'll try not to read between the lines too much. It's hard to talk about a typical hard-core raider, but a lot of them do their progression raiding (25 heroic Coliseum at the moment) on 3-4 nights a week, and spend other nights also doing the 10-player version or even going back to Ulduar to get a second hammer or whatever. I don't know very many progression-oriented players that breeze through the content and then log off.<br />
<br />
I'd also put the complexity of fights like Yogg, Mimiron or the Twin Valkyr against any ever offered in the game. If it feels like you aren't struggling to learn these fights as much as you used to, then that's probably true: there are now many sources for videos and strategies that have become a lot more robust and user-friendly, as well as pretty sophisticated UI mods to help you track everything going on. The whole raiding community is just more well-connected than it was in the MC and BWL days. Many casual raiders could name a handful of cutting-edge guilds these days, which just didn't happen 4 years ago.<br />
<br />
I don't think the server first folks are beating their heads against the content any less than they used to. What has changed is that the rest of us are able to follow in their footsteps a lot more easily now. Blizzard will definitely take some credit for letting a larger population of our player base to enjoy raiding. But I don't think the cutting edge folks are finding the cutting edge encounters any more trivial. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19820323342-tank-balance-and-encounter-design.html))<br />
<br />
Bosses dealing very high damage<br />
The bosses aren't overpowered though, and therein lies part of the problem. They actually get proportionately weaker. Say you dodge a Naxx boss 40% of the time and your mages crit that boss 40% of the time. Now you get to Icecrown and you dodge 60% of the time and the mages crit 60% of the time. This is a boss that is supposed to be much harder, and in fact hits harder and takes more damage, yet your chance to crit him or his chance to hit you has improved in your favor. You crit or avoid a &quot;hard&quot; boss more often than an &quot;easy&quot; boss. Bosses don't scale with gear. :)<br />
<br />
Since we like boss fights to last around say 5 min, because that just feels good, and the boss misses you more often, that means when he does hit he has to hit really, really hard or you'll never really be in danger and the fight will be trivial. This however makes the fights feel really RNG and places the risk of dying on every boss hit (or at least every second hit).

<br />
What they could do to avoid this issue is to make higher tier bosses be higher levels (eg T11 boss level skull being level +3, T12 level +4....) or at least more likely to hit and less likely to get crit/hit etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just want to touch on this. <br />
<br />
Player power across the board has been inflated over the last few years and not just because of glyphs. Revamped talents and new abilities have also increased the power of players by a large amount.<br />
<br />
For me as a longterm player, this has had a huge effect on the 1-80 game. While new raids and dungeons may be balanced with this new power in mind, old content has been repeatedly made easier and easier and easier relative to the increased power of players.<br />
<br />
We get to the point now that I can duo every 5 man instance in Classic WoW, without outleveling or outgearing the instance in question. <br />
<br />
I would really love for Blizz to go back over the game and increase the power of mobs to match the new inflated powers of players. I'm not asking for leveling to be made harder, just more challenging and fun. Increase the xp per mob if you have to, lets just keep things challenging because that is what we, as gamers, wish to face at the end of the day. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, most Naga seem to come equipped with Polearms, so I would not be surprised if a Legendary Polearm with a name along the lines of:<br />
<br />
&quot;&lt;&lt;insert funky naga name here&gt;&gt;, Trident of the Tides&quot;<br />
<br />
Now that being said it would be unfortunate to have such a weapon thats basically only ideal for Hunters and Druids, and perhaps DKs. Maybe if Paladins and Warriors get more use out of Agility (that being said Cataclysm stats will be differently organized, so it very well could turn out to be an epic weapon for all these classes...) it would have alot more form. Or maybe this Naga holds a weapon other than a Polearm and this whole theory goes up in smoke :p<br />
<br />
=or=<br />
<br />
Or as Mipsy mentioned, Neptulon could indeed drop the Legendary Staff, however to me personally it would come a bit odd that Neptulon, following male Naga traditions and lores, drops a weapon he would not be wielding himself, as usually staves and magic are left to the Naga Siren, the female Naga... But Im not saying it cant happen, it would just be weird to me. (Thinking of an Legendary Staff that would part the oceans and seas... The Staff of Moses, anyone?)<br />
<br />
=or=<br />
<br />
Maybe there will be more than one legendary? Who knows? :D<br />
<br />
-Avoidance-<br />
<br />
It seems to me that they'll be changing avoidance to scale differently when Cataclysm hits, something along the lines of required stats increased instead of needing to have stronger more dangerous monsters that hit harder to add the scare into a fight that would otherwise be, for Cataclysm type stats (im guessing Tanks with maybe 65-70k hp in middle tier) &quot;Oh dodged A-atk, B-atk, hit for 6k, dodge C-atk D-atk, hit for 6k...etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesnt want this, and methinks to fix it they will be nerfing the Avoidance scale at 85, so that bosses hit more frequently but not as powerfully so Healers dont get overwhelmed, something closer to &quot;Hit 6k, Hit 6k, Dodge A-atk, Hit 5k, Hit 6k, Hit 6k, Dodge B-Atk, Hit 6k, Dodge C-Atk&quot; Leading to more forgiving fights with still decent amounts of difficulty, and save the hard hitting versions for Hard Modes. Thats just what I think, and believe to understand</div></div><hr />

But neptulon has always been know as the ingame Neptunus.. and he has a trident. so yeah. Obvious its a polearm.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think it's &quot;obvious&quot; at all that the weapon referred to in the blue post will be a player-equippable Legendary item. The post makes it pretty clear the thing is for controlling the seas, and I don't think that's an ability they're going to give to players, and at the end of the post it even says that probably neither the Horde nor the Alliance should control it.<br />
<br />
I reckon the weapon that's being spoken about is just a tool to drive the lore and give players a reason to go and stop whatever Neptulon is up to. As if players need a reason to go and farm their purples...</div></div><hr />

I agree with the avoidance inflation. Not the crit inflation though... it's just more damage, it doesn't have the same effect as very high avoidance. If overall raid DPS goes up by 5000 dps (because of higher crits) then you raise the boss HP so the fight lasts 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Besides avoidance, there's also mana regen. You can get to the point were you can trivialize healing if you regen more than you use.<br />
<br />
They really, really, really should add more stats for tanks to worry about. They have way too many % modifiers. Armor, avoidance, and now even block. The only thing they have that's a flat value is stamina.</div></div><hr />

Do they honestly have no clue what's going on in their game? How about go join a server first guild and see whether they think the current content is trivial compared to TBC.

Now, feral tanks were supossed to compensate this by having higher dodge and stamina, but dodge was nerf by 15% at the same time that parry was buff by 8%, which leaves us in the dust.<br />
<br />
An stamina, what a laugh, the pal prot MT of my guild has more stamina than me (&gt;45k) when buffed.<br />
<br />
Thus, WTF?</div></div><hr />

I really have no idea why people say &quot;first&quot;, &quot;second&quot; etc - is it some form of self confidence therapy that I'm unaware of? &quot;I'm second! I'm second! Yes I am!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nidhöggr</div><div class="date">2009-09-15, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So as I read the thing about avoidance, in T11 and T12, 20% avoidance is goind to be hardcore to get and therefor nobody's going to get as high ? <br />
<br />
Imo, 20% avoidance isn't a lot :&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know what they're thinking. It seems like &quot;Avoid is to strong, so we kill it&quot;. Means in the next AddOn, the tankpieces will have nothing more but Stamina and Strength. Avoidance is dead, Defence is dead, Block is dead. I'm questioning myself how long it would last untill GC states something like &quot;We don't like how everyone is going for health these days....&quot;<br />
Another step into the wrong direction. This has NOTHING to do with mimimi the casuals killed the game (They did!) but with boredom. What was wrong about having some formulas to decide whether or not an item is better in one situation or not. Deciding for the right gear was one of the fun parts of tanking in BC. In WOTLK, it's useless already and when they don't change there minds, in cataclysm tanking will feel like gearing up in green items &quot;of the bear&quot;.<br />
<br />
It was fun to have a special gearset for every situation. You hit the key and you got more HP, more avoid, more block more threat or whatever you need. If your healers have trouble keeping you alive: Change to EH. If you need more RaidDPS: Change to threat. If you fight an dual wielder: Change to combined avoid. This differs the good tank from the bad tank and the experienced from the un-experienced, the twink from the main. And it was fun to have no absolute upgrades. Every piece of gear could be worthwhile, in most cases, there were no absolut decision (apart from T4 vs. T6, of course....). But when they change it the way they are planing, an armorpiece is an upgrade... or it's not. Boring.</div></div><hr />

They have way too many % modifiers. Armor, avoidance, and now even block. The only thing they have that's a flat value is stamina. <br />
<br />
Yes, one could be something ( *insert name here*) that just decrase damage done to you, its simple, you havent any RNG, it always &quot;proc&quot; , and tank could have another stat to stam in catalysm, because defence is gone, parry dodge in some way too, and if there will be only stamina, any dps whith crits imune from talents can tank too then, if he have enough stamina, so -dmg done to me is good idea for new tank stat imho</div></div><hr />

<br />
But neptulon has always been know as the ingame Neptunus.. and he has a trident. so yeah. Obvious its a polearm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Neptulon isn't a Naga and i don't see the logic where he has to use/drop a trident just because Nagas use them. Nagas only worship him, just as the flamewalkers did with Ragnaros and while they too used tridents/polearms you don't see Rag using or dropping either.<br />
<br />
While he was named after the roman god Neptune (who does wield a trident), I doubt Blizz will follow that angle and force themselves into a corner when it comes to choosing the make of a legendary weapon. Personally i would love to see a legendary trident ;D <br />
<br />
Also since Deathwing will shatter the barrier between the elemental realm and azeroth, we can expect to see Al'Akir the Windlord and Therazane the Stonemother as future raid bosses</div></div><hr />

And second, yes content is easyer...and they can solve it simple by doing this. ==&gt; Remove normal modes and make &quot;hardmode&quot; normal. If hardmode was basic bossfight we wouldnt be so super geared to clear it and we would actually need to put way more effort in doing the boss.<br />
<br />
New bosses are all about having the gear (wich you get from normal modes most dont even deserve to get)...anyway saying to much. Just remove hardmodes and you will have all 4664648132164 whiners about content being to easy pleased. (yes im one off, i know it, go ahead and flame :) )</div></div><hr />

Perhaps balancing would settle that issue, and allow for more competitive team compositions. <br />
<br />
Point two is probably a bit more valid a claim, though teams with healers can be beaten, even when a healer can heal themselves and their partner. It's called CC, timing and coordination. <br />
<br />
Point three is simply an opinion, and shouldn't be an actual cause for taking away something so many people participate in and like. So you think large matches are more entertaining. Not everyone agrees with you, clearly by the amount of people who run 2s.<br />
<br />
Perhaps finding 2 people or 4 other people you can compete with isn't possible for some players. So why not screw them out of getting arena points, and staying competitive with people who can. Yay Blizzard!<br />

And P.S. I would put the difficulty of the Twin Valkyrs fight right up there with the difficulty Anub gave in Naxxramas. One shot ftw.</div></div><hr />

We're not ready to talk about it yet. However, keep a couple of things in mind:<br />
<br />
<br />
•If your avoidance is 20% in say the second raid tier, then it might be 10% or less when you're running your first heroic at 85. Ugh.<br />
•If on the other hand, your avoidance is closer to 15% at 85, then the diminishing returns going from 15% to 20% are going to be so brutal that players might just give up and use other stats.<br />
•If avoidance is 20% in both the first tier and last tier, then you also have DR problems and in fact don't really feel like you are improving by acquiring more gear at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
All I can say it......OUCH! They expect tanks to only have 20% total avoidance in the second tier of content? I hope I am reading this wrong or something, because even in the first tier of Wrath a tank could get to 50% avoidance fairly easy. <br />
<br />
With so many wholesale changes happening though I am interested to see how they compensate for a reduction of over 50% of our avoidance.</div></div><hr />
