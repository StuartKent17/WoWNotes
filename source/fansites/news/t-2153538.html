like take fdks, they were broken since 7.1, yet blizzard decided to finally nerf most of their op spells (chill streak, syndra) just now while it was broken since 7.0<br />
<br />
<br />
and they didnt even touch rogues, i dont understand why, have anyone played 2s vs decent rogue? its impossible to win sub/assa rogues atm, they just pve to the ground</div></div><hr />

<br />
....Frost mages were complete trash before these buffs, and it's still not even a buff to the main glacial spike playstyle at all, just massive buffs to talents that were so under tuned that they were useless.<br />

<br />
Understand that this talent is still bugged, causing Thrash to behave as if it was the previous version of this talent which causes Thrash to cost rage instead of generate rage. I hate blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Annihilation, Blade Dance, Chaos Nova, Chaos Strike, Death Sweep, Demon Blades, Demon’s Bite, Eye Beam, Fel Barrage, Fel Eruption, Fel Rush, Fury of the Illidari, Metamorphosis, and Throw Glaive damage reduced by 2%.<br />
-Doesn't matter that much. Maybe accounts for latency at best.<br />
<br />
Chaos Blades now increases autoattack damage by 150% (was 200%).<br />
-AA wasn't what killed you. It was their initial burst and how long they were able to keep damage rolling on top of high mobility and CC(glaive, stun, prison)<br />
<br />
Eye Beam now only extends the duration of Metamorphosis once, with the Demonic talent.<br />
-Still doesn't change much. Less extended burst window<br />
<br />
Fel Mastery now grants 30 Fury (was 25).<br />
-No reason to take this<br />
<br />
85% to 80% agility in pvp is basically what they tried doing to rogues 3+ times. 5% each couple of weeks</div></div><hr />

It’s because they can, in the past buffs/nerfs had to be patched in so wasn’t done as frequent, as it needed a download client. Now that they have the tech to hotfix them in they can just throw them out as they go.... that and maybe they just can’t balance for shit :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Unsubed this week... Enjoyed a few things past 4 months but overall I feel no urge to play any longer. It's ok. I got lots of other stuff to do...</div></div><hr />

DH still doing insane dmg on arenas... They double the damage of every other class while healing as much as a healer because of metamorfosis leech.. Annihilation is almost 40% of their dmg because they can keep metamorphosis up for almost the entire cd of the skill. But blizz is still nerfing dk´s and letting those retards running rampart with dh´s</div></div><hr />
