<meta name="description" content="WotLK - Armor and Weapons Lists 
I talked about the final version of the item pages a few weeks ago, sadly it took a lot more time than I expected and I couldn't get them ready for the release of the expansion. Hopefully that's nothing a few extra days of work couldn't solve and most of these pages are now ready, they're not as nice as I expected them to be in the first place but most of the information is here and it will probably make your life easier if you're trying to upgrade your gear.

I talked about the final version of the item pages a few weeks ago, sadly it took a lot more time than I expected and I couldn't get them ready for the release of the expansion. Hopefully that's nothing a few extra days of work couldn't solve and most of these pages are now ready, they're not as nice as I expected them to be in the first place but most of the information is here and it will probably make your life easier if you're trying to upgrade your gear. <br />
<br />
Items are sorted by slot &gt; spec &gt; ilvl, it could be disturbing at the beginning but it will eventually make sense after a few seconds. If you REALLY want to sort the columns in a different way you can always click their name (your cursor won't change, but it works). <br />
<br />
Please report the following issues in comments<br />
Any error you can find. (Wrong spec, etc ...)<br />
Outdated screenshots (there are a few of them, most of the time the item tooltip will be up to date)<br />
Missing items<br />
<br />
The page for librams / totems / idols / sigils will be available in a few minutes is now available. <br />

Many thanks for that, it's gonna be one of the most useful pages about WLK in the whole internet.<br />

<br />
2/ Ground Tremor Helm (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37633) - Drops from 'Moorabi' in Heroic Gundrak, got it last night and going by the other helms listed it looks to be one of the better ones available before naxx raiding :)</div></div><hr />

Just thought I'd give the heads up that you mis-listed the totems of Dueling and Venture Co. Flame Slicer as Spell when they're physical, and The Elemental Plane is a hybrid.</div></div><hr />

2. the trinket &quot;Strike of the Seas&quot; (iLvl 138) is not for phsy.dps, it increases the spell power if used...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I remember from a bluepost somewhere far back that Blizzard specifficaly mentionned the Armory would not contain items if they did not drop anywhere on the servers.... although I highly doubt that it wouldn't have dropped 2 weeks into the expansion ... considering the sometimes harsh randomness of this game..... it might be true<br />
<br />
don't give up hope !* * <br />
<br />
thinking about it.... maybe the item's drop rate is bugged or something.... that would explain it <br />
<br />
Edit : Also... I forgot to note a great thank you to boubouille for those great pages, I would never have thought finding upgrades would be so easy :D* * Keep up the good work !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, is there any reason T7 pieces weren't included? I don't think this is necessary, but for those of us looking for &quot;best in slot&quot; pieces it would be nice.</div></div><hr />

--------<br />
Venture Co. Flame Slicer (totem shaman) is for physical dps. Flame Lash is their offhand attack.<br />
And as said by someone above : Totem of Dueling is also for physical dps.<br />
--------<br />
<br />
It's pretty sad to see so &quot;few&quot; choices for idols/totems/etc. It's basically a choice from 3 for a spec, and since won't have the opportunity to run 25-raids, so I'm stuck with only two options... as feral the badge one is an attack from back (shred), which I will barely use... I wished there would be more generic idols, like idol of terror, for more casual people who don't concentrate on any specific...<br />
<br />
Thanks for the list.<br />
<br />
PS : why the heal td.tableHeader.... why not use &lt;th&gt; that's what th are for : headers !</div></div><hr />

-Was already mentioned but I noticed that Totem of Dueling should be listed as physical DPS.<br />
<br />
edit - just noticed: Venture Co. Flame Slicer is listed as spell dps, but it effects lava lash...does spell damage, but its an enh talent...so I'd say thats melee.</div></div><hr />

Other than that, Namlak's Supernumerary Sticker is listed as phys dps. It has both dodge and parry ratings. My guess would be it's a tanking dagger. (Lord knows who'd take it though.)</div></div><hr />
