Creates Silkworm Cocoon, unique green item &lt;Right-Click to Open&gt;. Most likely the Imperial Silk is then looted from this.<br />

Just because you don't like fun things like that doesn't mean that it's a waste of time. Lot of people are probably going to be amused by them. The art team does not exist solely for raids. And designing a couple little hats that are just going to sit on your head is a lot different than creating a new model with a new skeleton and new animations.</div></div><hr />

Do you have any idea how much dps we loose in pvp because of steady/cobra shot? On top of that we have to waste 2 seconds switching into those aspects in the first place and we have to create cancel casting macro's to pull off silences in arena. And barrage sucked in pvp because we couldnt use it while moving so we had to loose the hawk buff just to use it.</div></div><hr />

GC has already indicated doing something about our burst. Problem is that's currently the only way we can put out decent #'s. this is likely the prelude to a big burst nerf, but attempting to keep our overall sustained the same.

At this moment Windsteed at PTR have model of tyraels charger.<br />
<br />
You also need to keep in mind that mounts are account wide now, so if you have a level 20 alt he/she can ride the mount if it's ground capable.</div></div><hr />

Rabid Increases your pet's attack power by 25% for 20 sec, down from 70% for 20 sec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, right. Hunters are now the Shadow-Priests 2.0. More counters, more cc, more kite-abilities...and as if that wasn't enough...a pet on top of it.<br />
As a shadow that isn't fun anymore. Either you are silenced or your spell gets reflected(do they still have ANY cooldown on those abilities? Doesn't really feel like it)....and even worse...they run away(out of range) and you can't cast anything cause you are slowed and got that pet on your heels. <br />
Priests now got some abilities to run a bit faster....but with those cooldowns and the fact that almost all spells that can be casted while moving have been ruined(shadow word:Death not possible to cast....plague only castable with orbs for which you first need to stand and get over the enternal casttime of mindblast. You really only have shadow word:pain....hard to do any damage that way, isn't it?) it's pretty useless.<br />
<br />
I mean, it was obvious that shadows needed more ways to defend themselves so they could deliver their damage and not be killed immidiately in almost any arena match(unless they had some heavy cc(i.e. rogue and mage) just spending their time protecting them). Now they have some abilities to live longer....but unfortunately they still can't deliver unless they go into a fight with orbs and proccs right from the start, cause they just got nothing(even less than before, without castable death, plague and horror) they can do while running away. So the bad situation didn't get better at all...</div></div><hr />

On top of that we have to waste 2 seconds switching into those aspects in the first place and we have to create cancel casting macro's to pull off silences in arena. And barrage sucked in pvp because we couldnt use it while moving so we had to loose the hawk buff just to use it.<br />
<br />
Those are what people like to call &quot;trade offs&quot;</div></div><hr />

Not sure what your smoking there ironfists, but there is no plate int/spirit BoA heirlooms, a part from one set of PVP shoulders.<br />
<br />
Even the head PVE piece brought in around Cata only has Mail. So from my under standing holy pallies cannot get the 5% int buff from wearing the correct armour type between level 80 to 85 unless they take off the mail head piece.<br />
<br />
Please correct me if I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

The WindSteed and the Quilen are based off the same creature! The Qilin/Kirin in chinese lore is sometime described as a &quot;dragon tiger&quot; and other times a &quot;dragon deer&quot;. Though the Quilen in game share closer looks to the ShiShi dog/lions than the Qilin dragon tigers they share a name with.</div></div><hr />
