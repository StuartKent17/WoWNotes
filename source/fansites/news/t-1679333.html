Garrison Campaign Quests<br />
Thanks for the tip! If anyone else has found they haven't been able to progress their Garrison Campaign storyline from week to week, or don't believe they ever started one, please provide more info and we can try to help. Checking the campaign locations may reveal an unknowingly skipped step as these campaign chapters also include an &quot;Assault&quot; bar, they can sometimes be mistaken as only being an Assault on the location.<br />
<br />
Wait there garrison campaigns? How i miss that and whee you start at? I hear about invasion and figure i did something wrong. But it seem so trivial and now i want to try.<br />
It's a weekly campaign that unlocks over time and is intended to continue throughout future updates, not too dissimilar to the 5.1: Landfall content, but this is a bigger and more sweeping story that send you out to the various level 100 areas across Draenor. The first 8 weeks offer quests somewhat randomly, and then the four after those are a set story progression, to be continued in future patch releases.

Patch 6.1 - Garrison Jukebox Music<br />
The initial Patch 6.1 build added a few songs with items (Legends of Azeroth (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122195-music-roll-legends-of-azeroth), The Burning Legion (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122196-music-roll-the-burning-legion), Wrath of the Lich King (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122197-music-roll-wrath-of-the-lich-king)), but the quests reveal other songs that likely will be available for your jukebox. There is no indication on how these will be unlocked yet.<br />

I don't know if you noticed, but Highmaul and Blackrock Foundry are part of the same tier. There's only 10 ilvl difference, which makes Highmaul Mythic gear still very interesting and better than BRF Heroic.</div></div><hr />

Blackrock and Highmaul are the same tier, just like MSV,HoF and ToES were. They never hardest difficulty to be done cross-realm until the next actual tier is out. Stop being such a crybaby and make a group on your own server, if you can't well too bad.</div></div><hr />

The screenshots are from the different shaders that attempt to switch certain color saturation/hues/whatever to attempt to get the whole look closer to what normal seeing people see.<br />

The first one being for people having problems with green, the second picture is normal, he third picture is for people having problems with red and the fourth is for those having problems with blue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My expectation is that it won't matter, the old heirlooms will cap at 80/85, and that is what they will be in the tab.<br />
<br />
So it won't matter if they are brand new level 60 ones, or previously purchased bought/upgraded 80/85. You will need to buy the 90 token and 100 token separately.<br />
<br />
If true, it means don't waste any time/resources upgrading any current 80's to 85's, since you will need to purchase the tokens either way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they were already fixing issues that were causing alot of pain, mainly trap stealing and how trapping worked when in a group. they allready were re-writing the code a bit, so may as well fix the unintended bug that was a result of lowering the cool down on the trap.<br />
<br />
<br />
additionally, its easier than ever to farm them now. There are way more spawns, and they respawn much quicker than before. Additionally, just go out there, invite a couple of the other people to a group, enjoy getting a crate each time some one nearby traps somethign. Did this with a dk yesterday pulling 3-5 river beasts at a time, had 20 some traps in under 10 mins.</div></div><hr />

I'm trying to imagine the hilarity bound to ensue if they implemented a &quot;cage system&quot; for followers similar to what they have for pets. So you could cage your ununsed Croman on your main and send to an alt.</div></div><hr />

As for the heirloom tab, functionality looks fine, but it appears that all of our current heirlooms will lose their enchantments? If so, not particularly happy about that.<br />
I am concerned about that as well. Some of the enchantments on my heirlooms no longer exist in the game; I don't want to lose them because the heirloom was automatically converted into the Heirloom UI. I hope that what @olandgren tweeted last year still holds true.<br />

yknow, you can always turn off ingame music and play some of your own in the background. We needed a jukebox why?</div></div><hr />

As soon as you log in to the character that has them, they are added.</div></div><hr />

<br />
illustrates the vast differences in the priorities of the games player base. The music, like character models, doesn't interest me one bit. But it is abundantly clear that both of these things are very important to a lot of others.<br />
<br />
This is the first Xpac I have played with the music off the garrison, garrison mine and gorgrond zone music are terrible IMO</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huldu</div><div class="date">2015-01-16, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm worried that when/if you put the heirloom in the tab it'll clear the enchants on them. That would really, really be painful(and quite pointless to be honest). But I wouldn't be surprised seeing that happen and having my heirlooms stuffed inside some alts bank like they've been for all these years already. I hope tho, that it won't happen. I was looking forward to a heirloom tab for many, many years(or actually just being able to mail them, which took many years...).<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; I wish they rather made it into some sort of &quot;fancy&quot; bank instead where you could store the heirlooms - including their enchants. It just feels like that would have been a way better way to solve the problem with people having enchants or multiple heirlooms with different enchants on them. Because these people(like me) will still have the heirlooms in a bank thus freeing up no space. It's a silly thing I know, but if they made it into a sorted bank, they could have kept their interface but allowed an actual BANK interface as well!</div></div><hr />
