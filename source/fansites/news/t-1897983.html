Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion class preview series. In this entry, we’re exploring the Rogue—to find out what’s in store for a different class, check out the overview. <br />
<br />
We finish off our early look at class and specialization design with the Rogue. In these blogs, we’ve been exploring class identity, discussing Legion’s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization—laying the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let’s delve into what it means to be a Rogue in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Rogues fend for themselves, looking for fights in which they dictate the terms. They’re the shadows in the night that remain unseen until the right moment comes to strike—then they dispatch an opponent with quick blade work or a deadly toxin snuck acutely into the bloodstream. Rogues are opportunistic thieves, bandits, and assassins, but there’s an unparalleled art to what they do.<br />
<br />
As with Hunters, the three Rogue specializations have long suffered from a lack of distinct identity. What truly sets an Assassination Rogue apart from Subtlety? And just what is a “Combat” Rogue anyway? Aren’t all three pretty focused on the art of combat? With that in mind, we’re making some bold changes that take each spec in a much more pronounced direction. We’re finding what makes them each special and amplifying their fantasy by creating abilities and talents unique to each spec that better align with their core theme.<br />
<br />
Assassination[/b][/size][/center]<br />
One of the favorite tools of the assassin is a pair of daggers coated with vicious poisons. The damage they inflict is deceiving at first—the initial wounds often seem survivable, even superficial. Then the toxins set about their business. Wounds don’t close, and blood loss continues unabated. Assassins begin their work stealthily, choosing their targets and methods of engagement carefully—but once committed to a course of action, they stick to their target until the job is done rather than disappearing into the shadows to avoid their quarry’s blows. <br />
<br />
&quot;Assassins begin their work stealthily, choosing their targets and methods of engagement carefully&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
For Rogues, no specialization describes itself better than Assassination, which also remains closely aligned with its existing fantasy. And we’re further enhancing those themes through their gameplay. First, this is now the only Rogue spec with access to poisons and bleeds, making much of your damage a little more delayed, but nonetheless massive. In addition, Venomous Wounds triggers based on a combination of bleeds and poisons now to accentuate that gameplay. Assassination is home to the most volatile combo-building. Mutilate is already effective in this regard, but Seal Fate needed some improvement—it now can trigger from both hands with Mutilate.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Assassination Rogues:<br />
<br />
Garrote<br />
<br />
45 Energy, Melee Range, Instant, 15 sec cooldown<br />
Garrote the enemy, causing strong damage over 18 sec and awarding 1 combo point. Silences the target for 3 sec when used from Stealth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mutilate<br />
<br />
55 Energy, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Attack with both weapons, dealing strong Physical damage. Awards 2 combo points.<br />
<br />
<br />
Envenom<br />
<br />
35 Energy, 1 to 5 Combo Points, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Finishing move that drives your poisoned blades in deep, dealing instant Nature damage and increasing your poison application chance by 30%. Damage and duration increased per combo point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rupture<br />
<br />
25 Energy, 1 to 5 Combo Points, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Finishing move that tears open the target, dealing bleed damage over time. Lasts longer per combo point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seal Fate<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
When you critically strike with a melee attack that generates combo points, you gain an additional combo point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Venomous Wounds<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
You regain 10 Energy each time you deal Bleed damage to a poisoned target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Potent Poisons<br />
<br />
Increases the damage done by your poisons by 70% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Assassination-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Elaborate Planning<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your finishing moves grant 20% increased damage done for 4 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Combat[/b][/size][/center]<br />
GONE! <br />
OK, not exactly. The lack of a clear theme for the Combat Rogue really gave us an opportunity to reimagine the spec in Legion, to ensure that they have their own depth of character and a unique fighting style that sets them apart from the other Rogue specs. <br />
<br />
Outlaw[/b][/size][/center]<br />
&quot;To survive in such a world, outlaws must become master swordsmen in toe-to-toe combat—and they can’t shy away from fighting dirty&quot;<br />
<br />
Outlaw rogues are the unscrupulous scoundrels of Azeroth. Operating outside the law, they bend the rules and distort the truth to get what they need. While they share plenty in common with other rogues, these outlaws have little use for tact or discretion, happy to engage in a tavern brawl or spontaneous duel, rarely patient enough to wait in stealth for the opportune time to engage. To survive in such a world, outlaws must become master swordsmen in toe-to-toe combat—and they can’t shy away from fighting dirty. If blade fails to cut too deeply, the outlaw takes advantage of a concealed pistol, catching the enemy by surprise with a quick blast.<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
To achieve the “swordmaster” fantasy we’re going for with the Outlaw Rogue, we’re giving them several new and upgraded abilities, such as Saber Slash and Pistol Shot. We’re also deemphasizing Stealth, with Ambush being their only remaining opening move. Stealth will still provide its core Rogue utility, but Outlaws are more comfortable fighting toe-to-toe with a sword than skulking about. Finally, we’re ensuring that Outlaws retain several signature abilities from Combat, such as Adrenaline Rush and Blade Flurry. These abilities provide a good basis on which to build new and distinct flavor. A wide variety of talents enhance the fantasy further with themes of the swordmaster, brawler, or even pirate.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Outlaws:<br />
<br />
Saber Slash<br />
<br />
50 Energy, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Viciously slash an enemy, causing moderate Physical damage and awarding 1 combo point. Saber Slash has a 35% chance to strike an additional time, granting additional damage and combo point, and making your next Pistol Shot free.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pistol Shot<br />
<br />
40 Energy, 20 yd range, Instant<br />
Draw a concealed pistol and fire a quick shot at an enemy, dealing moderate Physical damage and reducing movement speed by 50% for 6 sec. Awards 1 combo point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Slice and Dice<br />
<br />
25 Energy, Instant<br />
Finishing move that consumes combo points to increase attack speed by 40%. Lasts longer per combo point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Run Through<br />
<br />
35 Energy, 1 to 5 Combo Points, 8 yd range, Instant<br />
Lunging finishing move that causes damage per combo point and has increased range.<br />
<br />
<br />
Combat Potency<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your off-hand attacks have a chance to generate 15 Energy. Slower weapons have a higher chance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ruthlessness<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your finishing moves have a 20% chance per combo point spent to grant a combo point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Main Gauche<br />
<br />
Your main-hand attacks have a 44% (with Mastery from typical gear) chance to trigger an attack with your off-hand that deals minor Physical damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Outlaw-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Quick Draw<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Free uses of Pistol Shot granted by Saber Slash now generate 1 additional combo point, and deal 50% increased damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Subtlety[/b][/size][/center]<br />
Subtlety rogues are the masters of the shadows, and they strike unseen. They don’t have the lethal poison-tipped daggers of the assassin or the brawling prowess of the outlaw, but their acumen on the battlefield and ability to hide in plain sight are unrivaled. Some claim the art of subtlety looks like malevolent shadow magic—but no matter from where their power is derived, these rogues are capable of performing devastating assaults on their enemies, slipping away unharmed to strike again without detection. Most rogues train their entire lives to learn how to walk in the shadows—subtlety rogues were born there. <br />
<br />
&quot;The subtlety rogue's acumen on the battlefield and ability to hide in plain sight are unrivaled&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
As the true masters of stealthy gameplay, we’ve pushed Subtlety further toward making heavy use of Stealth as their primary combat mechanic. The new version of Shadow Dance allows Subtlety to weave in and out of Stealth rotationally. Meanwhile, Shadowstrike provides incredible mobility for attacking from Stealth. Finally, to further reinforce the matter of their relationship with sinister Shadow magic, Subtlety makes use of a new ability called Nightblade, which applies Shadow damage over time.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Subtlety Rogues:<br />
<br />
Shadowstrike<br />
<br />
40 Energy, 30 yd range, Instant, Requires Stealth<br />
Strike through the shadows, appearing behind your target and dealing strong Physical damage. Awards 2 combo points.<br />
<br />
<br />
Backstab<br />
<br />
35 Energy, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Stab the target, causing moderate Physical damage. Damage increased by 30% when behind your target. Awards 1 combo point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nightblade<br />
<br />
25 Energy, 1 to 5 Combo Points, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Finishing move that infects the target with shadowy energy, dealing Shadow damage over time and reducing movement speed by 50%. Damage and duration increased per combo point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eviscerate<br />
<br />
35 Energy, 1 to 5 Combo Points, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Finishing move that disembowels the target, dealing increased damage per combo point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow Dance<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your finishing moves have a 20% chance per combo point to activate Stealth. For 3 sec, this Stealth will not break when you autoattack or take damage. When this effect occurs, a Shadow Decoy will appear nearby, confusing your enemies.<br />
Developer Comment: This will function differently in PvP, granting the use of abilities that require Stealth, but not actually providing Stealth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow Techniques<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your autoattacks have a chance to generate a combo point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Executioner<br />
<br />
Increases the damage done by your finishing moves by 55% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Subtlety-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Relentless Strikes<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
You gain an additional 40 Energy when you enter Stealth.<br />
<br />

We hope you’ve enjoyed this early preview of our approach to Rogue class and specialization design in World of Warcraft: Legion. We’re looking forward to hearing more feedback and sharing in ongoing conversations with the community regarding these and all of the other changes we’ve discussed in this series, and we’re excited to get this information out before our broader beta phase to make sure we have as much time as possible to iterate and carry on the conversation.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading, and we’ll see you in the Legion beta!</div></div><hr />

Assassination seems to like dots (who doesn't?) and Subtlety's new stealth mechanic would provide for some fun world pvp :) that is if you'll still get stealth in the outside world, or will Shadow Dance stop working if it's triggered on a player?<br />
Over all I think it looks great :) Thank you Blizz</div></div><hr />

<br />
Meh, there goes all the fun.<br />
<br />
Like the changes but think Sub is kinda bad without that passive. Going stealth when using a Finisher is ok. You'll be hard to kill but after people get used to it won't be that strong.<br />
<br />
Maybe they change it back before beta.</div></div><hr />

Can only hope they redo the throw and dealdly throw. Make it instant, and make it do more dmg. (Throw) Add poison bomb for assasins. And make a spot for pistols so we can gather skins for it. Alltho I belive pistol will have same mechanic as throw.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's my impression as well. I was really hoping we'd see some new flavor for Assassination after all these years, especially with the devs really giving attention to changing up stale specs in many cases, but that's not what I'm seeing for the spec. Really wanting to see the talent list for Assassination now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess their main goal was to make the 3 rogue specs feel different from one another. I think they succeeded in doing so. <br />
However, whether all 3 of them are viable remains open but I am very eager to test them out.<br />
<br />
Specifically I am glad that:<br />
-Assassination didnt get a huge overhaul. It was always my fav spec and I am glad I can still &quot;pretend&quot; to be the sneaky, poisonous, assassin that kills only as much as needed, without having to get used to a full set of new talents/abilities. welcome back Mutilate.<br />
-Combat/Outlaw did get an overhaul and I am looking forward to trying it out. Integrating the concealed pistol is a great idea but I wanna see the implementation first<br />
-Sub gets a rework and it still looks like the go to pvp spec. Not sure if suited for pve but will still test it out. the shadow mechanics make me curious</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the only thing they added was that damage % buff after you use a finisher. I'm fairly surprised at the amount of changes, but wonder how much things will actually be shaken up. If sinister strike is being taken over by saber slash, that's stupid just because rogues don't use just swords (in fact, blizzard been throwing us fist weapons and axes mainly so we can share with enh shamans). I'm wondering if assassination and sub AoE is going to be forgotten again. Not that I'm saying &quot;these changes are shit!&quot; but this is just a preview, and while the preview of sub and combat were good, assassination told us absolutely nothing, it was like reading the preview for resto shamans all over again. That being said, you can't bring this up in general discussion unlike shamans, mainly because general forums hate rogues.</div></div><hr />

I mean bf stuck with 1 spec so that means if u want to raid u go single/aoe as always u stick to combat.<br />
<br />
Unless i have understand wrong u cannot have all 3 artifacts powered up the same at the same time.<br />
<br />
They should have either remove bf or make it baseline for all specs.<br />
<br />
And considering blizzard makes 90% of fights with adds and some fights with super heavy adds well........<br />
<br />
But overall there are some good changes and new mechanics cause rogue was stale almost since vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They should of made Outlaw a ranged spec with duel wielding pistols or duel wielding crossbow pistols. Really annoying that huntards get a melee spec when they are one of, if not the highest played classes in game that didn't need any major changes while rogues basically remain unchanged at least from that list of changes. <br />
<br />
Rogues will remain the lowest played class in game come Legion once the title of Outlaw wears off and people realize its the same spec with two slight changes.</div></div><hr />

Talents will change things significantly; Blizzard have already said that each spec is going to have a lot of unique talents. As a result I suspect the flavor of each spec will be significant difference once talents are factored in. For example, they mentioned cannon balls and grappling hooks being part of the theme for Outlaw, but those are not listed in this preview. This means they must be talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sub is going to be pretty fast in fights... with the whole Shadowstrike 2x -&gt; finisher (giving 'stealth' and 40 energy) -&gt; shadowstrike -&gt; bs|ss -&gt; finisher... All these shadow-moves porting you right behind the target... caster-nightmare. Plus you can stick to the target without having to slow it... Going to be reeeeally fast paced, too. Great fun inc.<br />
<br />
Assasination... my beloved assasin... I think it's going to be the snorefest of the specs, unless there are some REALLY sweet talents that make it mobile.<br />

Removing bleeds and giving them only to Assassination is something they managed to screw immediatelly. Whats the point of Subtlety having a &quot;shadow dot&quot;, its the same as rupture (the current ticking dot finisher). Also removing SnD and energy recovery mechanics serves what purpose? Dumbing down a class that revolves around quick reflexes, patient macro management and huge in-depth knowledge.<br />

<br />
Sub it will be easier to counter the spectral sight than the other specs because of shadow strike. A 40 Yd range teleport-ambush, so basically open quickly on Those demon hunters before they can feel charge you out of stealth.<br />
<br />
This preview is frustrating because I feel like it's leaving out many abilities (which I know and hope it is) but here's my take:<br />
Assn: I don't like this spec because I find it boring in WoD.. It seems as if they are removing dispatch too so this spec will be all about waiting and watching your dots/ me lee swings, pooling energy for envenom&gt;mutx2 as it already is. Unless dispatch is a talent or something, they didn't mention it.<br />
<br />
Outlaw seems cool, based on what I can gather from the preview it sounds the most fun to play considering the changes to sub. <br />
<br />
Sub I'm a little underwhelmed, Doesnt seem like a lot of ability variety. Renamed rupture, awesome? Class fantasy. Right. The multi strike dot advancement was fun and made things different, hopefully they can make it cool. To me it sounds like shadow dance is becoming our new 'slice and dice' for lack of a better word... I can see the spec playing by maximizing the amount of time in shadow dance while maximizing the energy you have before each 5 cp finisher <br />
<br />
Anyways... Sadly rerolling to ranged dps most likely cause of me lee bloat in raids :(</div></div><hr />

Would have been a really nice offset to the rampand ambidexterity. <br />
<br />
Acutally... imho, they should have moved away from &quot;dual wield for EVERYONE&quot; and made that an exceptional skill for a few classes-specs.<br />

01. PvP has separate talent trees, this has been said hundreds of times, why are people still talking about this or that spec being trash in PvP...<br />
<br />
02. With the above in mind this is a high level overview, not a piece by piece account of how each spec will play with every single ability listed - saying things like &quot;seems simplistic&quot; is ridiculous so early on in to the class reveals, it's not even beta yet.<br />
<br />
All in all as a long standing rogue these changes are a welcome breathe of fresh air with some familiarity tied in so we all still feel like Rogues in their original form. I'm looking forward to future information being released, it's early days but it seems positive.<br />

I'll use Subtlety as an example, because it is my favourite spec to play currently and it also seems like one of the specs that will change the most.<br />
<br />
The new abilities is not what's going to change this spec, Shadowstrike is just Ambush with Cloak and Dagger, Nightblade is just a renamed Rupture and Shadow Techniques is just a (maybe) slightly less predictable Honor among Thieves.<br />

The fact that Assassination is the only spec that gets bleeds means massive changes to how Subtlety plays.<br />
We know Sinister Calling is either changed or gone, which in my opinion is a bad thing.<br />
No multistrike procs causing Sinister Calling to advance our DoT's means we don't need to pay anywhere near as close attention to Nightblade as we do Rupture. No bleeds also means no Sanguinary Vein, so not the same rush getting a bleed going with your opener or on a target switch, and also much less consequence if Nightblade falls off. <br />
No SnD means no Energetic recovery and if they don't compensate a slower energy regeneration.<br />
The way Find Weakness works now is also pointless with a guaranteed attack from stealth after every 5cp finisher. <br />
<br />
We don't know what our primary CD is either, because I assume they are planning to replace Shadow Dance with something.<br />
You gotta admit that Shadow Dance as a CD is cool as hell when you compare it to something like assassinations super boring Vendetta.<br />
<br />
As it stands now Sub seems to be way more predictable, way less hectic and require way less managment and insight than in its current form, but<br />
we don't know the talents, all the passives/ability interactions, artifact tree etc. <br />
All I'm saying is that there is a lot of small details that together makes a huge impact on our decision making when we play a spec.<br />
Seeing the abilities posted above is well and good and gives us some ideas about theme and where they are trying to go with the class changes, but it's useless making any big judgements yet, we just don't know enough.</div></div><hr />

I like the direction but you really can't tell much without the talent trees. Personally, I can't wait until a talent is .00001% dps increase over the others and everyone feels &quot;forced to take it&quot; even though they hate what it does to the rotation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Outlaw is no more pvp spec (no cheap shot, garrote. etc. - only ambush)<br />
- Sub dont have garrote, so not so good in PvP anymore, but looks fun in PVE. Sub has movement speed reduce only by finishing? What? Backstab deal more 30% damage from behind. What? They removed HaT, and what did we get? The RNG &quot;Shadow Techniques&quot;, we cant count with it, not like with HaT.. I think its not good mechanics at all..<br />
- Assa almost like the old spec, so its good for PvP and PvE.<br />
<br />
I hope they will fix with PvP talents the slow issue and the garrote issue for Sub/Outlaw, cause now Sub is the most enjoyable (for me ofc) PvP spec, so I hope they dont want to destroy it.<br />
<br />
Im mainly doing PvE atm, so Im thinking about leveling as Sub, and off-spec the pirate-combat-outlaw-notsopirate-butstillpirate cause of hard AoE, so 2 artifact what I need to manage, BUT if I want to do PvP, need to manage the third artifact. It seems a lot of work for me.. But maybe they will keep their promise about &quot;every spec in good everything&quot; (AoE, PvP, PvE, grind)<br />

For PvE restealthing doesn't mean anything so I don't really get what the point of this change is. When you're fighting a boss it's not like it feels good to be invisible while he attacks someone else that he was already attacking. <br />
<br />
On the other hand this is the exact type of mechanic that has been missing from sub all these years in pvp and they are refusing to let it be meaningful. Rogues have this type of mechanic in pretty much every other MMO, I just don't get why they are so afraid to allow it in WoW. Just get rid of the bullshit like burst of speed to tone down rogue survivability elsewhere and make this stealth mechanic work in pvp as sub's survivability mechanic. I dont see what is so difficult about that.</div></div><hr />

I'm not against the pistol shot as a skill, but does that mean..<br />
Screw everyone else who wants to add some other flavor and fantasy to their spec, as long as you're happy?<br />
Or you just here to troll?<br />
<br />
If there's a minor glyph for it that's totally optional, and changes the pistol to a 1handed crossbow, knife, axe, pistol with a suppressor, what does that take away from you? How does that effect your gameplay if there's 10k rogues playing their ninja fantasy and you're playing as pirate?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because Warcraft guns are not as advanced as RL guns, melee weapons will have their use in combat for all of eternity, and Warcraft plate armor is likely a lot more durable than RL armor ever was that it can stand up to some gunfire. <br />
<br />
IIRC in Rise of the Lich King, Uther landed a direct hit on Arthas's breastplate with his hammerand all it did was dent his armor some and knock the wind out of him for a few seconds. With RL armor if you took such a hit to the chest by a strong as fuck bear of a man like Uther who also had a magical divine force augmenting his strength, your armor would probably wouldn't be of much help. There are even plenty of cases of someone taking such a hit wearing plate armor and suffering serious internal damage without the hammer even really penetrating the armor because of the force of the blow alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Swashbuckler has been in the definition as long as i can remember, even before the current ui came along, the spec gameplay has really never matched it imo, but that definition has been there. Would have been easier to just change one word, but what can you do..<br />
<br />
I'd still hold my breath for that.. the fist weapons that is.<br />
The transmog revamp is still coming, even though we might not be transmogging legendaries it would be just stupid to not allow rogues transmog swords to fists. I too am disappointed that guardians and windwalkers got fists over rogues as artifacts. But if needed i want to mog some old fists cause there's just way too many cool ones in the game before Legion. <br />
<br />
I think it was said somewhere that you'll be able to mog what you can use, with the restriction of no leather to cloth etc, but i do hope that means weapons that can be equipped can be mogged. But not sure about that, think it was some fine print somewhere so not official yet.<br />
<br />
Already pissed that all the outlaw artifacts so far are pirate themed cutlasses and rapiers and if there's no decent skin/model coming later on.. I'm 100% going to mog to fist weapons and if that's not allowed.. Well that's just a riot incoming.</div></div><hr />

1. Seal Fate can now trigger from both hands using Mutilate = 4-point Mutilates ftw!<br />
2. &quot;Venomous Wounds triggers based on a combination of bleeds and poisons now&quot; - Needs clarification because the ability still says: &quot;...each time you deal Bleed damage...&quot;<br />
<br />
Does this mean Venomous Wounds can proc when a poison ticks? If so, does that mean having Garrote+Rupture+Deadly Poison, will all three (or four with Crippling) potentially proc the extra Nature damage and 10 energy?

I have been playing Combat since Vanilla WoW and the change to Outlaw still seems very strange to me. I don't mind the name change, but the overall combat style is what gets me.<br />
<br />
They could have gone two ways with this that would have been equally awesome.<br />
<br />
* Clean up the rotation and information for Combat and expand it to multiple weapon types by doing the following. Shore<br />
<br />
1) Remove Bandit's Guile and roll it into the spec's base damage or as a flat passive boost to smooth out the damage of the spec.<br />
2) Make Slice and Dice either a passive boost to attack speed or have it be a passive that buffs you for X seconds after you use a finisher.<br />
3) Adjust the damage of abilities so it scales based on the DPS of the weapon so Daggers, Fists, Axes, Maces, Swords are all equally viable.<br />
4) Removing Revealing Strike and rolling the bonus into Sinister Strike was the way to go. That's a great change.<br />
<br />
* Alternatively they could have done something even more exciting and made Outlaw an entirely new spec that offered a dual wield pistol setup for a medium range DPS spec.<br />
<br />
Either way.. this is still just a preview and we haven't seen talents and items yet. I'm looking forward to seeing what else they have in store for this!<br />
<br />
My ideal &quot;Uniqueness&quot; to this class specs would have been the following.<br />
<br />
Assassin - Master of Poisons/Bleed/Sustained Damage on One or a Few Targets.<br />
Combat - Master of Weapons and Close Quarters Combat. Tough, Evasive, and able to hit for a decent bit of damage to both area and single target.<br />
Subtlety - Master of Shadows. I actually really like where this version of Subtlety is heading.<br />
Outlaw - Master of Pistols and Mid Range DPS. Quickdraw attacks with their pistols to deal decent single and area effect damage. Holdout dagger for close range melee suppression.<br />
<br />
Druid gets four specs, Rogue could have been pushed that way too!</div></div><hr />

Rogues are a blast - my first character in the first two weeks of vanilla is the rogue who is still my main - or was when i stopped playing last year. They're one of the few classes that you need to change your mindset with - you can't go toe to toe with other players or mobs, you have to learn to control the fight and kite and sneak around. In PVP, once you get good at the class, you can terrify an entire battleground and play games with the other players, it's a total blast. You die a lot, but if you do it right, you kill a lot too. <br />
<br />
They're not for everyone, easy to learn, hard to master, but if you put the time in, they are completely worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, I could just leave my statement at that, but then I wouldn't be contributing to the conversation, just using ad hominem - like both of you did to get past the fact you couldn't be arsed to, I dunno, share why you disagree with Alayea's personal assessment of Combat rogues in Legion. Yes, she could have taken the time to elaborate on why she doesn't like but that in no way at all excuses your own posts.<br />
<br />
I don't agree with Blizzard's vision (ugh, I am very rapidly tiring of those two words together) for the spec, like Alayea and Vajarra. I've had a combat rogue since Wrath of the Lich King, and never once felt like an &quot;outlaw.&quot; Combat, to me, is the idea of a rogue that chooses to be a jack-of-all-trades within their class, not a crazy pirate. But that's just me. I'll go back to eating my Klondike now.</div></div><hr />

But for Combat, it looks like renaming it and renaming Sinister Strike, don't fix it's core issues. Interesting that we get a pistol draw animation now, that might end up looking and feeling really cool.<br />
<br />
&quot;Outlaw&quot; just needs a faster game-play. Combat has been slow as fuck for ages, and on top of being slow, it is empty and devoid of any engaging or interesting gameplay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
except:<br />
PvE: You don't really vanish, you distract so well, your oponent doesn't even realize you vanished... your decoy stays around until you reappear.<br />
PvP: You don't vanish at all, you just get to use an opener.<br />
<br />
Yeah... that class identity really worked out well...<br />
<br />
I won't mention how weird it is to have the poisons and dots on an assasin, not on the sinister-shadow-rogue... Since we all know that a good assassin lets his victim runaround, scream, cry and alert the guards while slowly bleeding to death? Right? Perfect Class/Spec Identity... <br />
<br />
Too bad that in the history of ever releasing anything class newsy... blizzard has NEVER really corrected any blatant, glaring errors... :/</div></div><hr />

&quot;Outlaw&quot; is a despicable attempt at making a flavor spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, I could just leave my statement at that, but then I wouldn't be contributing to the conversation, just using ad hominem - like both of you did to get past the fact you couldn't be arsed to, I dunno, share why you disagree with Alayea's personal assessment of Combat rogues in Legion. Yes, she could have taken the time to elaborate on why she doesn't like but that in no way at all excuses your own posts.<br />
<br />
I don't agree with Blizzard's vision (ugh, I am very rapidly tiring of those two words together) for the spec, like Alayea and Vajarra. I've had a combat rogue since Wrath of the Lich King, and never once felt like an &quot;outlaw.&quot; Combat, to me, is the idea of a rogue that chooses to be a jack-of-all-trades within their class, not a crazy pirate. But that's just me. I'll go back to eating my Klondike now.<br />
<br />
Why the fixation on the &quot;pirate&quot; theme? If it bothers you, don't call yourself a pirate. Heaven forbid we can use some creativity in our roleplaying game...<br />
<br />
My combat rogue is a gentleman thief and royal spy &amp; assassin on behalf of his magister lady, with his mastery alchemist skill to complement his deadly combat powers. Now, with all specs available, he can select his proficiency based on the assignment. Outlaw will be his main spec, because he has to be versatile, and being able to fight in any circumstances. (The character is a bit inspired by Walter from Hellsing, but of course twisted to fit WoW and the Blood Elves.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get over it, Outlaw can mean many things, a shady bar brawler who's never been near the sea. Fuck, just call it Combat if it makes you feel better. The rotation is basically the same shit just renamed. Nothing to get wound up about that's for sure.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NorthWay</div><div class="date">2015-11-13, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Toe-to-toe was the old (3.x and earlier) Combat with extra dodge, extra parry, extra hp, (two different) dodge procs, parry procs, dodge from agility, and extra dodge on demand. I specced that way in Wintergrasp (yeah, one of those non-viable non-cookie-cutter hybrid builds).<br />
No bleed, no AoE, no stealth stun, no poison. It might play well, but I'm not sure if it is _rogue_ anymore.</div></div><hr />
