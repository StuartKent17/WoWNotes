<br />
Media always gets one so of course they're front and center, and because not everyone gets one first wave, or at all, people jump on the &quot;streamers only lol!!!&quot; bandwagon.<br />
<br />
Case in point OW beta was vastly seen as only streamers.... we had beta, but we don't stream so who the fuck is going to know we have beta besides us and those we play with? lol</div></div><hr />

Enhanced textures/models does absolutely NOTHING in terms of gameplay.<br />
<br />
I see nothing wrong with a client-side toggle to enable better textures/models.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on if addons are enabled or not, usually they're not early on.<br />
<br />
And on your model thing... that's going to depend if the models are in the classic files already, if anything has to be changed file wise that'll get you banned.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I wish they had a toggle too. Or at least just a landscape/doodads toggle...? Old terrain and stuff is pretty rough.<br />

I'm guessing that since it'll pull from retail files, which are &quot;a part of the game&quot;, it'd be fine, or a grey area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I concur, leveling in retail may also be dull but atleast it can be done relatively quickly, where as the 1-60 grind in classic is gonna be a loooooong slog, especially if you happen to be classes that either have piss poor sustain so they need to sit down every half a second to eat or just a generally shitty damage output.</div></div><hr />

It's not gonna be in time for the next expansion. That's too early, they're already working on that. <br />

It would probably be added in the expansion afterwards, which is still four years away, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, watching a bit of the streams it looks good so far. Certainly interesting to see it with the modern light/shadow engine. I guess I forgot view distance always had that annoying blue fog in Vanilla. <br />
<br />
The combat looks good but something is definitely off with the pacing. Feels too quick, especially for casters.</div></div><hr />

So much for their &quot;you think you do but you don't&quot; mantra.<br />
<br />
This is the highest WoW has been in a long while on Twitch.<br />
<br />
Seems like a lot of people are interested in watching Classic WoW.<br />
<br />
You really think something being top viewed within its opening day somehow proves anything? Its &quot;new&quot;, people probably want to just see of it really is like it was. <br />
<br />
I would bet everything I have that it will die down faster than bfa. And if that happens and there are more people watching bfa content than classic, will you then say the same thing you've just said about classic, solely based on twitch views?<br />
<br />
If anything I am sure there are quite a few people that watched it then remembered it wasnt as great as built up in their head and lost all interest. <br />
<br />
If you prefer classic, play classic. But you and others like you need to stop with this shitposting. It is annoying and makes you look desperate for attention.</div></div><hr />

LOL imagine being this ignorant and delusional.<br />
You must be new to WoW and Twitch, or just not very bright.<br />
If we based a games success off their twitch views on the first day, then Conan would be an amazing game...oh wait...it's dead. Ok ok let me try again, how about Atlas? nope it's dead too...hmm...OK I GOT IT! what about WoW! it had over 200,000 views when BFA launched and everyother expansion...but wait it only gets 10,000-15,000 views on an average day outside of raid progression first weeks damn... oh you know what... No mans sky? nope nevermind. Battlefront? nevermind, WILDSTAR!? oh wait it's so bad they closed the servers but it got 300,000 views the first week... Shit<br />
<br />
Oh well, But yeah you're right You think you do, but you don't.... KNOW ANYTHING</div></div><hr />

<br />
Addon dev sure<br />
<br />
Maybe not a good game tester per se, but beeing watched and basically recording/streaming every step they make during beta will definitely help the devs for sure. In theory it's much easier to find a problem/bug/glitch if you caught it 'on tape' while ~25k people are watching. Also streamers often go out of the regular way to entertain their viewers, so they maybe encounter a problem other people wouldn't even find.<br />
<br />
Please don't get me wrong. I'm not defending either way in this 'streamer-privilege' debate, but there are definitely other aspects to it then just generating hype/monitizing the beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Beta is for testing. That is it. It's not a preview. It's not a way to hand-select important customers and throw them a bone. It's not a reward for your loyalty. It's a test (and other than streamers, most participants are literally picked from a programming script). You shouldn't even be having that much fun while playing it, to be honest. I was in QA for Activision (played Guitar Hero 8-Hours a day for 6 months) and it wasn't really fun. You had specific tasks. There was pressure to report bugs. You weren't expected to just dick around.<br />
<br />
If only developers would stress this more. Take a hit in the marketing department (or, rather, let the marketing department do their job) and be upfront with people. This is for testing gorsh darn it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't notice the email at first since it went to one of my spam folders. In fact, I only looked in the launcher because of this exact post on mmo-champion, where it said to check the launcher. In my launcher, under the IN DEVELOPMENT it has Beta: WoW Classic. I started the download this morning and after about 5 seconds it was at Playable :D</div></div><hr />

Tell this to streamers. All they do is whining that it's nothing like the shitty private servers they came from.</div></div><hr />

Good for me that I'm not watching any of the streamer. It's just waste for my time, I've got planty other things to do(playing myself included!). Though I agree, it seems that some of them have higher impact on the community than just no-name.</div></div><hr />

I have come to honestly hate this kind of advertisement. I don't really expect to get in but these kinds of streamer only/preferred betas have become way to wide spread, its happening with almost every online game. They say it's a &quot;love letter to the fans&quot; but someone like my older brother doesn't get in despite having a near constantly active sub since Vanilla.<br />
Also funny that they specifically stated that the people who will be invited should have a lot of game time. Streamers/influencers didn't even exist in Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

The devs are known to watch their streams and can quickly see issues live instead of in a bug report (assuming that someone submits one since nobody really does).</div></div><hr />

It will show up in your battlenet client, under in development if you have world of warcraft selected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I agree with you. I feel like they lost all of their cool zombie appeal with the rework. I also feel like the old female Tauren model had more character, the new one looks like a weird goofy llama.<br />
<br />
I don't have any plans to play Classic but being able to use the old models is pretty tempting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah so people can get to the boring/non-existent end game. I think Classic, and Live are just for two completely different personality types. There are people who garner enjoyment out of the adventure of the whole game, and then there are just those who want to get strait to the end game, eat up the content and have it at that.</div></div><hr />

Remember that at low levels health regen is pretty quick because your numbers are so low to begin with...<br />
<br />
All levels up to level 26. Regen is out of whack with what Vanilla was. Remember that as someone who got into Beta, I am a more accomplished wow player than you. If were talking about a Cata revival maybe you would have something to say. Please clear the forum for us real players.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has an internal &quot;pilot&quot; list that is utilized and its extremely likely that the streamers have been added to that list at some point. I was added to that list about 6 years ago, I don't stream, and I get every beta invite on day 1 for anything blizzard runs a beta for. Just opt in and when they decide to expand their invites, you might be able to get in. Or... make friends with a Blizzard employee and have them submit your email address to their pilot list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And getting to 60 in Vanilla is rewarding so we don’t mind the grind.<br />
<br />
Getting to 120 in retail is like “meh” because everyone already have 10x lvl 120 characters. Being max level is not rewarding anymore so levelling just feels pointless.<br />
<br />
I’m looking forward to Classic where being max level actually means something.</div></div><hr />
