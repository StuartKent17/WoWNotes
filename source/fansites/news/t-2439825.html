Forbes Interview with Ion Hazzikostas on Battle for Azeroth's Launch<br />
Forbes sat down (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/10/10/the-state-of-warcraft-ion-hazzikostas-post-mortem-on-the-battle-for-azeroth-launch/#348c154cc194) with Ion Hazzikostas to discuss the launch of BfA and hot topics from the community.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/october/thumb/forbesion.jpg (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2018/10/10/the-state-of-warcraft-ion-hazzikostas-post-mortem-on-the-battle-for-azeroth-launch/#348c154cc194) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The team has enjoyed seeing the millions of people dive into the world of Battle for Azeroth.<br />
Ion admits that there was some major issues at launch such as the auction house lag and the Legion Mythic + data carrying over to the first week of BfA Mythic +.<br />
When they introduce major new systems, there's a lot to learn in terms of player feedback, from the beta to seeing millions of people interacting with them in a much more real way.<br />
The team is actively trying to bring Azerite Traits in line with each other via Hotfix.<br />
The &quot;we told you our issues during beta&quot; criticism is always tricky because there are many different people with many different opinions and play styles doing a variety of different content. It is impossible to please everyone, but they are always listening.<br />
Things like long ramp up times for Shadow Priests and Feral Druids are major concerns because it essentially does make them irrelevant for the environment of Mythic +, and the team recognizes that as a problem.<br />
The team makes sure that the core systems of the expansion are polished and ready to go, but realize that they can't delay an entire expansion for millions of players if a specific class or spec is not perfect.<br />
Ion never said that the classes were not complete in the Q &amp; A in which he said certain specs needed to wait for a patch to get adjustments, just that some of them needed to be adjusted and looked at still.<br />
The truth of the matter is that classes are never complete in WoW and are always being adjusted and iterated. Often times changes in beta require other unforeseen additional changes in live.<br />
The team recognizes that pressing several abilities on the global cooldown that do nothing but buff your character is not good gameplay and plan to address it (such as with frost death knight). They want to further develop classes so that these abilities do more than just buff.<br />
Gameplay hasn't necessarily slowed down so much as whenever a new expansion launches stats have to be brought down as a character levels in order to stop characters from getting ridiculous stat percentages.<br />
The team's top priority as of now is getting out content consistently and working on the Azerite System and the feel of Island Expeditions.<br />
Azerite Armor was easily accessible in early game, but the team realizes that it became hard to acquire as you progressed in item level.<br />
They are looking at how they can improve delivery of Azerite armor to get it into player's hands without also just having a loot hose where suddenly everyone is drowning in the stuff and it doesn't feel like it's even a reward anymore. They want to find a happy medium.<br />
The team wants the Azerite powers to be more than just an externally solved math problem and give decisions such as what is most enjoyable for gameplay.<br />
The team likes some sort of mystery that requires players to solve such as with Reorigination Array. They like to see players figuring out that this special buff takes 3 bosses per week to upgrade and that it basically happens organically as you raid.<br />
The team recognizes that they could have done a better job explaining the different phases that happen during Warfront progression.<br />
The team also recognizes that they should have explained the changes to the amount of loot rewarded from your weekly cache before BfA went live.<br />
The team still wants Island Expeditions to be the best way to obtain Azerite and will continue to iterate on Island Expedition rewards as a whole.<br />
They want Island Expeditions to feel more like questing and exploring in the world while leveling, meaning more clear roads and camps that lead to quests and objectives that are more dynamic.<br />
The main source of pride for this expansion is the art team and the world that they created.<br />
The team is happy with how War Mode turned out as well as the dungeons and raid.<br />
It was awesome to see the race for Mythic World First.<br />

Play with the Blues - Darkshore Warfront<br />
You can help test the Darkshore Warfront with the Blizzard Devs tomorrow at 1 PM Pacific!<br />
Tomorrow - Friday, October 12, starting at 1 PM Pacific (4 PM Eastern) - many members of the World of Warcraft design and QA teams will be hitting up the PTR to test the new Darkshore Warfront being added in Tides of Vengeance!<br />
<br />
This initial test will feature the Alliance version of the Warfront. For testing purposes, it'll be accessible to characters level 110 to 120, and be forced active for the duration of the test regardless of the state of the Darkshore zone. We've also added an extra Warfront table to Stormwind to help newly-created PTR characters get in on the test easier, and sped up the overall cycle (again, to aid with testing).<br />
<br />
Your participation is invaluable at this stage of development for the new Warfront, so we'd love to see you join us tomorrow as we put it through its paces. Thank you!<br />
<br />
<br />
Join The Great Gnomeregan Run–October 13!<br />
Are you a gnome? Do you know a gnome? Would you like to BE a gnome? (And who wouldn’t?) Then rise UP to the challenge of The Great Gnomeregan Run on Saturday, October 13 from Gnomeregan to Booty Bay.<br />
<br />
Where: Beginning outside the gnome starting area and ending in Booty Bay<br />
Who: Alliance-Only (Don’t worry, Horde can create a level 1 gnome and join in the fun too.)<br />
<br />
Whether you’re a level 1 gnome (highly encouraged), a level 71 human, or a level 110 draenei, you’ll be able to join in this fun run beginning in the gnome starting area, winding through Dun Morogh, Ironforge, the Deeprun Tram, Stormwind, Elwynn Forest, Duskwood, and Stranglethorn Vale where the run culminates in Booty Bay.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/october/thumb/gnomerace1.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/october/gnomerace1.jpg)<br />
<br />
It's a big big BIG world out there, but don’t worry about getting lost, there will be course markers and spectators along the way to help keep you on track. You’ll even see a few familiar faces among the onlookers!<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/october/thumb/gnomerace2.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/october/gnomerace2.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
Stranglethorn Vale is a dangerous place for low-level characters so you may want to find some muscle to join you along the way for a little extra protection. If you’re a higher-level character, think about playing chaperone for a gnome.<br />
<br />
Whether short or tall, it will be a good time for all.</div></div><hr />

he's right though, there WAS a lot of feedback and there WAS a lot of BS-feedback as well. I can imagine that if you have no one who filters out the good from the bad, that it's impossible to find useful information. <br />
<br />
A lot of feedback is also not useful. Statements like &quot;remove the GCD change, it's garbage&quot; isn't useful since it doesn't adress the reason why they implemented it in the first place. I've seen no thread where someone who doesn't like it mentioned the problem Ion talked about above.</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't think he has 100% say on everything unfortunately and he has to defend their design choices which are not all his. It seems to me like there might be inner turmoil within the dev teams, you can see in his face that he is not happy and is just being a politician about a lot of stuff.</div></div><hr />

They didn't have to release on the day they did. In the past, they've held product to give more time to tune fix known issues. The release announcement said the expansion would release no later than September 21st, so why rush it out more than a month early? They could have done a proper beta test before release if they gave themselves another month.<br />
<br />
In the June 14th Q&amp;A specifically said that enhancement, shadow, and to a lesser extent elemental shaman would not be getting the attention they needed until 8.1 as the window for major changes was rapidly closing. If they knew 2 months prior to release that they weren't able to address these issues and still were going forward with the release date, maybe that's a problem with their new policies? I mean, you have 12 classes in the game and you are saying that you know that both dps specs for one class aren't in the best place. If you've been playing a dps shaman forever and a lead at Blizzard is telling you that they know that you don't have a good option for your class to dps right now, but please wait 5 months for this to be addressed (from the date of the interview, not release to 8.1), don't you have a right to be upset by that?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2018-10-12, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He flats out say they released what they had, done or not, because deadline over quality. They KNEW the expansion wasn't done, and they shipped a flawed product. <br />
<br />
Which begs the question, they had two years to do this. Possibly more. The art team has work to show for it. What the fuck were the rest of them doing for two years? If this is the best they can do in two years, then...well, I think they need to hire people that can do better.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aekero</div><div class="date">2018-10-12, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to be a jerk about it, but the gcd changes _were_ garbage. It's a sweeping change that affected mechanics/rotations/flow of classes. Some classes and specs were affected way more, it feels really bad as a class that has like 4 buttons that in essence read &quot;do more or take less damage&quot;, but for 1.5s less. As a healer, I'm not always going to have CDs to line up with damage spikes, I need to have a catch up mechanic. Some healers do have their buffs tied to another effect, and those don't feel as bad, but those specs that are literally just a buff feel worse overall. Even if they were to increase buffs by a second to make up for time lost, it wouldn't change the feel.<br />
I truly believe there were different ways to fix the &quot;push 1 button and pop 5 CDs &quot; problem. Why not just put those buffs on a short CD like they did with trinkets? Would that not be a less painful solution, or is that 1 hit/heal simultaneously with a buff that game breaking.<br />
If nothing else I certainly don't think this change would have ever happened if they weren't trying to balance the game around arena.</div></div><hr />

For some things yes.<br />
<br />
But there is others, that the dev team 100% knew about. We are talking major bugs like temple with the eye falling through the floor.<br />
<br />
It happened day 1 of beta, it has been happening since....thats just not good enough.<br />
<br />
I am worried they are happy with the shitshow that is wm too. Pseudo Forced pvp because pve rewards are locked behind it was never a good idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is the feeling was right though and they even admit it.. sure not everyone communicates the right way but what everyone does have in common they play the game to have fun. And atm, and mind you I speak for myself, a big part of the game is no longer fun. And this is no longer a matter of perspective, the state of the game is in a very bad state when we look at several major selling points of the expansion. I had such great hopes for azerite, a plethora of choices, each a strength in it’s own way.. targetable and with traits easily unlocked by farming.<br />
<br />
Let’s see, traits are mostly generic, would not be a big problem. Its also not a big problem if some traits perform better in certain situations as long as they are targetable in mythic + for instance. With all the rng of these traits AND the fact they don’t forge there is NO reason whatsoever to not have them drop from mythic +. Hell, have them drop quaranteed from weekly chest from your highest run for I care but at least some way to counter this fucking poorly designed RNG clusterfuck.<br />
<br />
And this is only one of the problems...</div></div><hr />

Yeah you are probably right, I also suspect this has something to do with PVP, since in other circumstainces you are right, it does not really make a difference. In raids, over the long run it does not matter that much, some classes just have these dps burst windows...wish they would just counter the dmg via templates in pvp, keeping the gcd as it was and mitigating the burst another way.</div></div><hr />

The thing is they got this feedback not only from the cranks but more importantly from those players that are part of the top 20 guilds, during alpha &amp; beta testing and they didn't listen to them either.<br />
If you don't listen to those that are in that small group then you as a dev or boss like Ion don't give a flying fuck about your players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The issue is not how many people gave &quot;Feedback' but the form in which that feedback was given.<br />
<br />
It's difficult from a dev standpoint to do anything with the information your given when you don't understand the crux of the issue.<br />
<br />
Look at the difference between these two feedback reports.<br />
<br />
&quot;The changes to GCD suck, fix it&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't like the way GCD affects my class, it makes it feel slower and more clunky&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
It all goes back to that old adage, If Henry Ford had done what everyone else wanted, we would have had faster horses.<br />
<br />
WoW's playerbase is bad at providing useful feedback, they mention a solution to a problem, but not the problem itself, and when the CM's ask them what the problem is, they get defensive and start shouting, which causes the thread to get locked, and that feedback is ruined.<br />
<br />
<br />

It's not hard to login to discord, figure out who knows what they're talking about, and setup a focused and formal feedback loop during beta. Do you know how many product people would love to have that kind of focused expertise available?</div></div><hr />

They didn't have to release on the day they did. In the past, they've held product to give more time to tune fix known issues. The release announcement said the expansion would release no later than September 21st, so why rush it out more than a month early? They could have done a proper beta test before release if they gave themselves another month.<br />
<br />
In the June 14th Q&amp;A specifically said that enhancement, shadow, and to a lesser extent elemental shaman would not be getting the attention they needed until 8.1 as the window for major changes was rapidly closing. If they knew 2 months prior to release that they weren't able to address these issues and still were going forward with the release date, maybe that's a problem with their new policies? I mean, you have 12 classes in the game and you are saying that you know that both dps specs for one class aren't in the best place. If you've been playing a dps shaman forever and a lead at Blizzard is telling you that they know that you don't have a good option for your class to dps right now, but please wait 5 months for this to be addressed (from the date of the interview, not release to 8.1), don't you have a right to be upset by that?<br />
<br />
bc, is impossible to tune, every single class w/o million of player feedback, some tunning go beyond the betas, more at the point the game is. <br />
<br />
No game to this day come out 100% polish, and ever game have bug. So i dont know why ppl give so much crap to blizzard about it, they work hard to introduce alot of fix during current patch and majoy change on new patchs. <br />

They scrapped systems that worked in order to implement systems that didn't. They don't listen to feedback. They give non-answers (one of the blue posts was &quot;deal with it&quot;). There are many issues and ignoring them and defending blizzard is just sending the wrong message to them. You can be okay with a half assed mediocre product from a multi billion dollar company but many others aren't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you personally have the feeling that most of the people in WM only do it for the (minor) PvE rewards? Personally I love the new Warmode and I haven't ever turned it on to receive a 10% bonus on WQs, but maybe that's just my subjective perspective on that matter. <br />

<br />
Of course they are, everyone is playing with warmode on because of the absurd amount of unecessary bonuses for doing so. Even players from &quot;pve realms&quot; are playing with warmode on because the bonuses are really stupid and finding groups with warmode off on group finder became a problem (is it that hard to filter the warmode on/off from the list Blizzard? Jesus...).<br />
<br />
Everyone is doing dungeons because it's far easier to drop gear and raid loot is crap except from the azerite armor (which make players farm the raid because of it).<br />
<br />
It's a total mess, but they're happy with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, for starters, 5 months of no changes to a broken experience for someone playing a specific class, costs that player 5x$15 = $75 - the price of a new AAA game.<br />
<br />
Then, of course, to add insult to injury, they have shown to be perfectly capable of rushing out emergency next day out of cycle hot fixes for things they deem broken even if they are not harming anyone (things like toy cooldowns, completing group quests in raid groups in WoD, and they even almost pulled the trigger on a next day emergency fix to patch out garrison fishing in a raid group). Their priorities are completely out of whack with how long fixes take. To leave a class/spec utterly unable to play content for months on end while patching out fun within a day is completely unacceptable.<br />
<br />
Players have every right to be pissed.</div></div><hr />

Game Director sure, but you have someone higher than you who has money invested telling you to make WoW more like mobile phone games, then you do what they tell you because they pay you as well. There are likely multiple factors going on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All in all I just feel that people really like WM, but maybe it's just the people I play with.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatelly they're doing it for the rewards.<br />
<br />
They're not minor pve rewards. Extra XP, rep (and of course honor, which is 0 from pve), azerite, dmg and healing (both fro the kill buff and from the powerful pvp skills) for faster WQ completion and gear drops (the chests).<br />
<br />
At launch, just the extra XP and damage was enough. While I was still at 111 with WM off, all my friends and guildies with WM on where already 113 and when we had the power drop from disabled legendaries, they were still doing high damage to mobs while I was suffering from the bad mob power scaling at 117-120. And those bonuses in a expansion where each side plays on it's own map...<br />
<br />
In the end I just turned WM on and enjoyed a much faster leveling and less problems with mob scaling. Turned it off again at 120 for WQs, but can still see how far ahead others are in azerite, rep and gear... while doing the same activities. When I turn it on for some specific activity (like the WM achievements or making it easier to find groups for Arathi rares), I can see so many players trying to avoid wpvp with WM on, because of the unecessary bonuses, instead of just turning it off.<br />
<br />
Players just standing there, still (or trying to run away), because they don't want to do it, they're doing that only for the damn bonuses.<br />
<br />
People should be playing with WM on because they like it, just like when they decided to play on pvp realms. Not because they'll receive plenty of pve rewards and faster progression for doing so while the others receive 0.</div></div><hr />

Saying that things aren’t as bad as another game means absolutely nothing. Who cares if game X by mystery developer Y was broken for years other than the people who bought mystery game X? I and many others have a right to complain when its not just an imagined issue. Its an issue that Ion himself acknowledged was a problem back in June. If you are happy with the game, great. I’m happy for you. Just don’t belittle other people’s valid concerns just because of an “it could be worse” type of situation. The game was not ready for launch. The shaman and shadow priest complaints were just a small part of that. Every other day there was a huge issue. Whether azerite tunings of 250%, mythic cache screw ups, removing weapons from people that earned them in raid, warfront rollout imbalances, etc. They chose to release it 5 weeks earlier than their own announced window end date.</div></div><hr />

I'm slowly coming to the realization that the game is in its worst shape ever. I believe that Ion and co. have seriously lost touch with what makes wow great and make players stick around. <br />
The fact that they are circlejearking around these systems like island expeditions, azerite armor, warfronts, titanforging, warmode etc is to me evidence that they have forgotten that the ONLY thing that matters is community. When a player can go through basically the entire game without uttering a single world to another player, WE HAVE A PROBLEM ION! Start with that! Give players a reason to be part of a community. Where is the in-game guild recruitment tool? Where is the difficult content that makes you ask a friend for help? Where is the content that forces you to communicate with your fellow gamers? Where is the amazing looking armor that you can only get from banding together with friends? Where is the raid/pvp-armor that makes me WANT TO DO THAT CONTENT?<br />
When bob raids 8 hours a week and mike only pugs shit 1 hour a week, how is it possible that these two players are even remotely close in strength? <br />

You're correct that WoW is a &quot;business&quot; and not a charity, but said business does need to make the customers happy or you have no business and Blizzard has forgotten this.

The two servers that I play on, Illidan and Area 52, always say &quot;full&quot;, no matter what time of day I get on. The two medium population servers that I have other characters on always say &quot;medium&quot;. Not that I really know if any of that really means anything. There are still the same number of people in my guilds, minus maybe one or two, that still log on regularly. The only thing I really see them complain about is not getting loot drops from world bosses or things like that. When I do WQ, there are still a ton of people doing them also. Although on that, it does depend on the time of day now. Yes, I do understand cross-realms and that it may not much of anything either.

Oh fuck off mate. What's the fucking point in having a beta in the first place if the input from the players is going to be ignored.<br />

This seriously comes across to me like Ion has head so far up his ass, he's licking his stomach lining.<br />

That's about right on the mark. <br />

And &quot;millions of people&quot; playing? Who is he kidding? Didn't they stop tracking subs when they went below 500k? (or something, I don't remember the exact #)<br />

<br />
you really think WoW have less that 500k player.<br />
<br />
-.- ppl really surprise me this days.<br />
<br />
No game the size of wow will be able to function if they have that little player base. <br />
<br />
They stop tracking away about 1M mark.<br />
<br />
Plus, i know we like to complain bc WoW isnt anymore the game we used to play and whatever, but the game still have a good life on it, is just easy to see if you go to any city and is full with ppl and you have multilple groups going on a raid night. <br />
<br />
Go play a dying game and you will see the differences. I play SW Galaxie at the end or other dying mmo and wow isnt close to it</div></div><hr />

The board at ATVI don't have one fuck to give about gameplay, classes, or warfronts. All they care about is profits - how Ion and Brack do that? That's up to them. <br />

Ion is the DIRECTOR of WoW. Thus, he's responsible for the direction of the game, regardless if the ideas are his, or the teams. The Board at ATVI is not sending him emails to not let raids go into warfronts as a group. Ion and his team decided that.</div></div><hr />

That interview is a bunch of hot garbage, just like BFA.<br />
<br />
For the last month I have literally only logged in on Mondays to play for a few hours just to do a few of the soon to expire weekly tasks, and only out of some kind of inherent obligation. This is in stark contrast to early on in Legion where I actually logged in more than once a week because I was playing out of enjoyment, and not out of the ingrained obligation that you develop from playing this type of game. The kind of learned behavior that makes you believe that you are somehow missing out if you don't do your weekly in-game tasks.<br />

I lasted for about 10 months before losing interest in Legion, and now after just 2 months in BFA I'm basically already holding on by my fingernails.

I think I just don't want to accept that I have already quit for the foreseeable future, I just didn't know it yet.<br />

I'm looking forward to picking up Divinity Original Sin 2 again for the definitive edition, and frankly there are so many great games out right now, and being released every month that are more worth your time than anything Ion and company would have the potential to create.

Any other job on the planet requires some form of passion and decent public relations. That dude who got caught on camera spitting on a customers pizza got fired immediately.

And he still has his job! It's incredible, just mind-blowing. How he has such a leading position within the WoW team yet doesn't at all want to make it fun.</div></div><hr />

A lot of feedback is also not useful. Statements like &quot;remove the GCD change, it's garbage&quot; isn't useful since it doesn't adress the reason why they implemented it in the first place. I've seen no thread where someone who doesn't like it mentioned the problem Ion talked about above.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kallisto</div><div class="date">2018-10-12, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunatelly they're doing it for the rewards.<br />
<br />
They're not minor pve rewards. Extra XP, rep (and of course honor, which is 0 from pve), azerite, dmg and healing (both fro the kill buff and from the powerful pvp skills) for faster WQ completion and gear drops (the chests).<br />
<br />
At launch, just the extra XP and damage was enough. While I was still at 111 with WM off, all my friends and guildies with WM on where already 113 and when we had the power drop from disabled legendaries, they were still doing high damage to mobs while I was suffering from the bad mob power scaling at 117-120. And those bonuses in a expansion where each side plays on it's own map...<br />
<br />
In the end I just turned WM on and enjoyed a much faster leveling and less problems with mob scaling. Turned it off again at 120 for WQs, but can still see how far ahead others are in azerite, rep and gear... while doing the same activities. When I turn it on for some specific activity (like the WM achievements or making it easier to find groups for Arathi rares), I can see so many players trying to avoid wpvp with WM on, because of the unecessary bonuses, instead of just turning it off.<br />
<br />
Players just standing there, still (or trying to run away), because they don't want to do it, they're doing that only for the damn bonuses.<br />
<br />
People should be playing with WM on because they like it, just like when they decided to play on pvp realms. Not because they'll receive plenty of pve rewards and faster progression for doing so while the others receive 0.<br />
<br />
Then people need to learn this little thing.<br />
<br />
Just because something is slightly more rewarding doesn't mean they are forced to do it even if they are super mythic and can choose not to.</div></div><hr />

-Since day 1 Alpha nearly everybody told them that there were major issues with azerite gear, secondary stats and class design. They started adressing these issues a month before launch so only a few classes could get fixed and then they said they didnt had enough time. Bullshit. <br />
<br />
&quot;The team makes sure that the core systems of the expansion are polished and ready to go, but realize that they can't delay an entire expansion for millions of players if a specific class or spec is not perfect.&quot;<br />

-Then maybe dont launch that unfinished game a month earlier. Nobody would have minded another month or two of argus. <br />

I also like how he keeps pushing Azerite gear and traits in everyones face during any interview or Q&amp;A! Its to late to try and fix it and they should have listened to the feedback. Its complete BS - I remember in Legion when we were told no more carrying around a pile of gear because everything goes to your spec and it was a god send! Now I have bags full of stuff again and its ridicolous! they did all these changes including the GCD change to make everything slower to give them more time to fix everything.

The truth of the matter is that classes are never complete in WoW and are always being adjusted and iterated. Often times changes in beta require other unforeseen additional changes in live.<br />
<br />
He should become a lawyer. He's desperate now.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure during Legion they said they had new tools to help &quot;tweak&quot; and &quot;adjust&quot; classes so they could easily fine tune them in situations like this...<br />

<br />
All in all I just feel that people really like WM, but maybe it's just the people I play with.<br />
<br />
I have it on purely for the PVE rewards, like the majority of my guild. If I get attacked, which has only happened like twice since launch, I just stand there. I hate PvP but the rewards are worth it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
For an expansion that has no new developed features and is mostly made up by reused assets, the amount of bugs and poor testing is absolutely insane. To add that to the poor class balance and the many &quot;oops&quot; we didn't see that coming because we didn't want to is embarrassing.<br />
<br />
For the Azerite Armor system for example, they enabled a vendor to sell the various gear with 2 days before the expansion was set to release. The easiest and cheapest way to fine tune that system was to enable the vendor as soon as you had the most traits in and see which were the most used traits by players as they were engaging in content. They would have discussed on forums/simmed and did free testing for you, but then you would of had to fix the situation--- and this is the thing Blizzard didn't want to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, look at Legion--it brought a lot of people back. Granted it didn't hold everyone's attention but it brought to the table a lot of systems and designs that really made it fun to play. Plus, it was one of the most smooth and balanced launches I've ever seen for an expansion. Legion saved World of Warcraft after the travesty that was WoD...but I don't know if there is another &quot;Legion&quot; to save the game from BfA.<br />
<br />
It really depresses me that I've spent nearly half my life playing WoW only to have it end in a whimper instead of a bang, strangled by someone as arrogant and clueless as Ion.<br />

<br />
They did that during Legion, actually.<br />
<br />
Also that's what levelling is for. If stats didn't get reset each xpac by the end of the second one we've have guaranteed crit and absurd haste and mastery levels.<br />

&lt;---- My avatar pic sums up how stupid WoW has become. Just look at it on your Blizz launcher.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has always injected silly things into their games, from day one. Or did you forget poking the cow in D1 leading to an april fool's joke eventually becoming the real cow level in D2? Or the funny quotes from units when you kept clicking them in every SC game?</div></div><hr />

I'm trying to flatten the earth by walking on it. Trying doesn't mean a thing if the effect is nowhere to be seen.<br />
<br />
The team has enjoyed seeing...<br />
I don't care what the team enjoys. We're the clients, they're supposed to please us.<br />
<br />
They are always listening<br />
Yet they choose to ignore players. Nobody liked Warfronts or Azerite Armor since beta. Island Expeditions sucked as well, but showed &quot;potential&quot;, so let's give them a pass.<br />
<br />
the team recognizes (...) as a problem<br />
Yet they choose to do nothing about it for 5 months, until the next large content patch.<br />
<br />
The team makes sure that the core systems of the expansion are polished and ready to go<br />
That's a blatant lie. The team had to buff/nerf several azerite traits by HUNDREDS % few weeks after launch. The classes were/are a mess. Revamping professions made them more useless than ever. That's only a few things out of a whole bag of BfA failings.<br />
<br />
The team's top priority as of now is getting out content consistently...<br />
The team's top priority should be fixing the game, fixing the classes/specs and apologizing for BfA in general.<br />
<br />
They are looking at how they can improve...<br />
That's what beta is for. On release you shouldn't be &quot;looking at&quot; how game works out on the current build.<br />
<br />
The team wants the Azerite powers to be more than just an externally solved math problem<br />
Lie. If that was the team's goal 90% of Azerite traits wouldn't have been passives that in no shape or form influence your gameplay and rotation.<br />
<br />
The team likes some sort of mystery that requires players to solve such as with Reorigination Array.<br />
The team likes when you have no idea how the game or its mechanics work.<br />
<br />
The team recognizes that they could have done a better job explaining<br />
Should be read as: The team didn't want to admit how something works, because even on paper it looked bad.<br />
<br />
The team still wants Island Expeditions to be the best way to obtain Azerite<br />
Even after player feedback who consider IE as a chore and a not rewarding, UNFUN activity. Scenarios failed in MoP, yet they've decided to bring them back for some reason.<br />
<br />
The main source of pride for this expansion is the art team and the world that they created.<br />
God forbid the gameplay of a video game would be the best thing about a video game.<br />
<br />
The team is happy with how War Mode turned out as well as the dungeons and raid.<br />
I'm glad the team is happy then, that's all that matters it seems.<br />
<br />
It was awesome to see the race for Mythic World First.<br />
AFAIK They didn't reach out to help organize it, even though it gave them tons of free coverage and advertisment for their game. Also they're so happy about World First Mythic Race they've decided to ruin it in 8.1 and make &quot;community figure it out&quot; (since Allies and Horde have different bosses and in different order).<br />
<br />
Glad to see you're still full of crap, Ion. I'm gonna enjoy the day you get removed (not fired mind you) as the Game Director.</div></div><hr />

They changed secondary stats twice in legion. But they changed secondary stats again in bfa beta so mainstats would outscale secondary stats. In bfa you will not get a lot more secondary stats than you already have right now. Maybe you will start with 20% haste and at the end of the expansion you will have 30%. Where in most other expansions you would have like 15% haste at the beginning and 40% at the end.</div></div><hr />

lol is this a joke? Azerite gear is THE core system this expansion and it's far from polished or &quot;ready to go.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;we told you our issues during beta&quot; criticism is always tricky because there are many different people with many different opinions and play styles doing a variety of different content. It is impossible to please everyone, but they are always listening.<br />
<br />
The CMs need to be fired then. They obviously aren't doing a proper job of relating common feedback to Devs. Are they picking what they think is best instead of what majority of the players are posting?<br />
<br />

<br />
rofl<br />
<br />
Yeah, when entire communities point out major issues, there is just no way to understand what is going on. /eyeroll<br />
<br />
Do people really buy into this nonsense? A number of key issues were very accurately pointed out in beta by large numbers of people. No one who ever manages any project of any kind treats all opinions as equal to each other. If they actually bothered to listen at all, that is actually an admission of major project management failure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Things like long ramp up times for Shadow Priests and Feral Druids are major concerns because it essentially does make them irrelevant for the environment of Mythic +, and the team recognizes that as a problem.<br />
<br />
This again points to a major failure of either project management or testing. There are not tens of thousands of different classes / specs. Either they didn't really test a number of things, they didn't test them with all the classes (there are 36 class/specs, it is simply not that hard to test the fundamentals with that number), or a combination of both. It isn't a matter of a Shadow Priest with specific talents X, Y, and Z using this unexpected rotation...the challenge described above happens to multiple classes regardless of talent choices and using expected rotations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gameplay hasn't necessarily slowed down so much as whenever a new expansion launches stats have to be brought down as a character levels in order to stop characters from getting ridiculous stat percentages.<br />
<br />
Laughable on the face of it just in consideration of GCD changes. Again, are people buying this BS?<br />
<br />
<br />
The main source of pride for this expansion is the art team and the world that they created.<br />
<br />
Understandable as that is, by and large, the only thing provided in this expansion that didn't have notable design and play issues. Unfortunately, most of us came to play a game, not watch it passively like a TV show.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is actively trying to bring Azerite Traits in line with each other via Hotfix.<br />
<br />
Translation: Math is hard.</div></div><hr />

The whole &quot;oh there are a lot of feedback&quot; isn't properly addressing this issue too, because just because there might be different voices doesn't mean you don't change anything.<br />
<br />
I don't think Blizzard is too stupid to do stuff; i think they don't care because the playerbase is so tolerant at this point that it actually makes very little sense to make changes. Honestly the only way to address this issue of complacency is to vote with your wallet, but I doubt that will happen since most players are as complacent as the devs themselves right now and the biggest dissent is maybe complaining on the forums or unsub for a cycle or two, which honestly aren't very effective ways to get the point across.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or try to move away from the goddamn ARPG combat where things die in a few seconds while on the move. Shadow Priest was one of my favorite specs long ago but then the game actually supported specs with long ramp-up times. This endless garbage GOGOGOGOGOGO-style design is at fault.</div></div><hr />

So they should remove attack/spell power and crit then? Cause that's what your primary stat is. Those two stats in 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you playing classic or something? ^^ <br />
<br />
Primary stats dont give crit anymore. They are just AP/Spellpower and some parry/dodge/armor for tanks but very little of it. They just make your spells hit harder without changing anything about the gameplay.</div></div><hr />

Yet not long ago he was saying about the poor communication.. Listening is part of that process.<br />
And again NO on the key issues like Azerite traits. total lack of anything to do at 120, opinions were the same<br />

I've reported multiple herbalism nodes spawning under the objects and rocks (impossible to gather) in beta and on live multiple times especially Winter's Kisses in Tiragarde Sounds. Guess what? Blizzard still didn't move the locations of these nodes close to 2 months in into the expansion. I guess moving nodes from x location to y is so hard and takes so much coding.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm calling Ian, the &quot;fake&quot; game director, a liar.<br />
<br />
They have priorities on fixing bugs. If you report that the herb nodes also drop a ivl 370+ gear they might hotfix it in 20 mins. So basically they only fix fast bugs that benefit the plays.</div></div><hr />
