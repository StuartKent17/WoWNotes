First off all, we want to thank all of you who have shown interest in testing WoW Classic. Having extra eyes on so many aspects of the game is a huge help as we prepare for the upcoming release.<br />
<br />
At this time, we’ve finished sending out all of the invites for the first stress test (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-1/178282). This large invite wave took a number of hours to process, so please check that thread for details about it and we’ll see many of you there when the test begins later today. Also, don’t forget that we have a couple more stress tests scheduled (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule), so keep an eye out for updates on those in the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
Related to this, we’ve seen a lot of questions about the general invite process and want to clarify a few things. The method in which people are invited from the opt-in pool is not on a first-come-first-served basis, but instead we look at a variety of factors such as the age of the account. That said, the amount of closed beta invites that we’re sending out is rapidly decreasing as we have met our current population needs for testing. We’ll regularly reevaluate the need for additional invites as we go through the testing process.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your continued interest in WoW Classic and we can’t wait to see you in Azeroth on August 27!</div></div><hr />

So, when they say they look over every account, they mean every account. theres at minimum 12 million accounts, not accounting in the slightest for people who might own 2 or more accounts. In that pool, you're a drop of water. The odds of you being selected for the cup, in this metaphor, is shockingly small.<br />
<br />
Does it suck? Hell yeah it does.<br />
<br />
Can you do anything about it? Not really.<br />
<br />
It's anecdotal evidence to provide, but with exception to account age, you and I share the same statistics</div></div><hr />

I have 3 accounts one that its my main account made during BC and the other 2 made in 2005... The one made in BC got the Beta invite but my other two didn't. I think Blizz bases it off on others things like money spend on the account and time played. I have never cancel wow subscription on my BC one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
except this is probably gonna be the most limited beta they've ever done. they already said they are gonna drastically slow down invites. note that there is a difference between having a beta invite and being in the stress test.<br />
<br />
i'm not salty. i got invited to the stress test. but people saying its rng are wrong. blizz even said so. and people who say &quot;dont blame it on not being an influencer&quot; are wrong too. they are using classic to build hype for the warcraft brand, and the best way to do that is invite influencers into the game. i just wish they would be honest about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, streamer. My husband is not a streamer and got a regular beta invite, don't believe all the whine on the internet. I got a stress test invite like yourself and have also been playing since 2008.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't really get why people are crying so much about not getting into the beta (not you necessarily but others). I played to level seven and had a blast over the weekend BUT I'm really limiting my play in the beta going forward because it will just take away from when Classic is released. I just wanted to play it a bit to see if I really want to play it in a few months...and I do!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leaf4Prez</div><div class="date">2019-05-22, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If I recall from one of the interviews, they wanted to keep the beta relatively small as there wasn't a huge need for feedback based on the bugs, etc. They wanted to bring in &quot;experienced players&quot; to make sure they got it right. The best way to do it was to invite streamers who reach a broader audience than you or I. This isn't just because of hype. It was to make sure that they got the classic feel right. It is unfortunate that it is the way the game is now, but it is better to delegate to a smaller amount of people (senators and representatives) to get the voice of the people. <br />
<br />
It is not a system I enjoy, but I see the logic in how it works. If you got the beta, and your audience is... 1. The only feedback they receive is your opinion. To be frank though, most streamers only care how well they can monetize it for themselves, which is why Apex Legends died so quickly. The best way to monetize classic to to create a sense of missing out with fewer invites, and hype from around the world of the most popular streamers. Sure they'll take a reputation hit, and you'll cry and moan, but you'll be playing. It's classic.<br />
<br />
Be patient, understand the world, give it the finger, and then take advantage when its your turn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh! So there *are* normal people getting those as well... nice!<br />
And yeah, I completely agree. If I got in, I'd probably end up messing around with character creation for a few days and then leave it so that I have all of my hype good and ready for when the flood gates open in August.. so to say, hah. I'm far from any sort of altoholic, I burn out quite easily, so were I to get invested in a beta, I'd prolly have not much left for when it actually counts.<br />
hence, I'm actually quite glad I got into this stress test as it's a good middle ground for me :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Almost every single streamer with more than 200 viewers has gotten an invite. It's pretty BS and no one says that you have to play sine day one to get an invite. It's the opposite, they aren't even inviting hardcore fans. Which should be a priority (I'm saying this even though I started later)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know about a dozen people who don't stream and got beta invites. Now all but 1 of them did play in vanilla so that might have something to do with it. It could just be pure random nonsense too. Only reason people know so many streamers got it is they are streaming it and yelling it from a mountain top. They are also people that test every time the ptr/beta servers are open so they are who you would want to have testing again.</div></div><hr />

The game is important, but this is the first of multiple stress tests, aka this is where you're likely going to get stuck the earliest in the process. The stress tests where you actually manage to get in good game time, will be in the future. <br />

<br />
Also, I don't really get why people are crying so much about not getting into the beta (not you necessarily but others). I played to level seven and had a blast over the weekend BUT I'm really limiting my play in the beta going forward because it will just take away from when Classic is released. I just wanted to play it a bit to see if I really want to play it in a few months...and I do!<br />
<br />
Are you silly? Just because not everyone who got the invite is a streamer, that doesn't mean that streamers didn't get priority. Go and see literally every content creator on twitch regarding WoW, they are all playing classic.

It's a fckn Stress Test. I guess they lowered population cap on realm, so they can stress test it.<br />
They need to test any situations with login servers, with realm lists, with low lvl zones, with layering.<br />
So if some1 stuck at queue or keep DC it's intended. Caz it's f-ing STRESS TEST.</div></div><hr />

So you think that over the next 23some hours no one will be able to login? Don't understand what you mean by &quot;that was never going to happen&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
This is their login servers. Something they have tested over and over for like 15 years now. How do they not know what their login servers can handle?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game itself has a large impact on what can be handled, server quality improves year by year. You're acting like the server quality is the same it was 15 years ago, hell even the same as bfa launch. It's not, things improve, optimisations get made.

I'm not sure why a person couldn't enjoy two distinct experiences for distinct reasons. <br />
<br />
Some people enjoy multiple movie genres. I hate Adam Sandler, but if someone I know likes him but at that particular moment is watching Die Hard, I don't walk up to them and start shouting all like:<br />
<br />
'I don't know why you're watching this when you could be watching LITTLE NICKY, or enjoying all of the jokes in GROWN UPS'.<br />
<br />
That's because I know that people can like more than one thing. You don't seem to get that, and I can only assume you're a bit simple.</div></div><hr />

They have to gage how much traffic they'll be getting. They're also probably checking how many people give up after a certain amount of time. Perhaps they're limiting the amount of people able to log on to test stuff with the current amount of people logged on.<br />
<br />

It's not that we can't take your opinion on it. It's really not an earth-shattering revelation that somebody on MMOC wants to play a shit version of full beta on the stress test about a nanosecond after the servers open. I can take that news standing up all day.<br />

The reason people are replying to you is because you're being a big, wet, weepy baby about it. Instead of just accepting that they're running a test whose specific goals and parameters haven't been revealed to you, you've instead opted to decide that if stress test realm senpai doesn't let you in there must be a problem with the test itself. Spoilers: even if you think you know something, you still test it when something important is on the line. <br />

If the login servers didn't work at launch, you'd be the first to be bawling your huge, newly-formed eyes out. That's why they're testing them now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From my understanding the layer system shouldn't have an effect until people actually make a char and get on the servers. It's essentially sharding but instead of merging servers it's splitting a server population so an area isn't overloaded with players.</div></div><hr />

Am I annoyed that blizz has to do a full crashing stress test after 15+ years of doing them. Sure. Am I crying about it in anyway? no. I mean hell I would have had only 1 post in this thread if people weren't mad that I have an opinion that is different from theirs.<br />
<br />
And yet that one post was unequivocally you crying -<br />
<br />
<br />
I get it's a stress test, but after 20 minutes of trying to get into something I can only play for a few hours........<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm done trying.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizz knew how many would be trying to get in (they invited them...) for them to be this unprepared is ridiculous. <br />
<br />
Even that would have been fine (ish) if when it was pointed out to you that maybe the point of this whole thing wasn't so that you personally would get to kill some boars, you had just backed down because you're not that upset. No big deal, right? Wrong. You then went on to defend your ridiculous stance multiple times, despite it being really obvious even to someone so dim that they can't be around sharp objects that a stress test is designed to break shit. <br />
<br />
It's not ridiculous that they're unprepared. They're trying to break it on purpose; if they were unprepared, this would have gone really smoothly. <br />
<br />
Complaining about how long it's taken to get in, following that up by throwing your toys out of the pram announcing to the world that you're going to stop trying, and then shaking your fist at Blizzard for the inconvenience is either you crying, or you posting something that nobody could possibly give a fuck about even if they tried really hard. Like, were you complaining, or telling us about how boring your night is?</div></div><hr />

Yep. Checked twitch randomly throughout this process and they are &quot;all&quot; in. <br />
<br />
I get that they need to test logins, etc. But to have people invited to help test that are excited and can't get in for nearly 90 minutes while the streamers seem to be fine; that's just bad customer service right there. And yes I do realize they don't want streamers having a lot of people watching them stare at these same screens we all are seeing.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure you understand how projection works. I'm trying to work out how the part you highlighted in bold is supposed to be a burn, but I think if I keep doing that then my brain is going to burst and leak out of my ears.

From reading their post it's suppose to be a server stress test. As in game server, not login server.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We expect to put a lot of people in the starting zones, though, and we’re looking forward to seeing what you all do as we test the servers under crowded conditions.<br />

With that said I can understand why they're doing the whole classic thing - anywho - got a stress test invite and have spent the past 87 minutes trying to get in. Furthest has been the char creation screen and lots of character creation failed messages, then kicked out, realm offline, etc. That's all fine, it's a stress test - but I must admit to being pretty pissed off at seeing streamers getting in without issue. If Blizzard want to prioritise logins (and they clearly do and always have done even just for technical reasons) that's fine and dandy, but make it known and don't pretend otherwise. That way the rest of us can decide whether to play along with the &quot;stress&quot; test or not bother.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't think they should prioritise anyone bar blizzard personnel, it's supposed to be a stress test - if blizzard are scared streamers will crap all over them for not being able to get online, don't do public stress tests. They can run simulated mass logins, character creation, heck they can simulate almost any aspect of game play if they wish. This is just taking peeps for granted, poor show blizz.</div></div><hr />

In that pool, you're a drop of water. The odds of you being selected for the cup, in this metaphor, is shockingly small.<br />
<br />
Does it suck? Hell yeah it does.<br />
<br />
Can you do anything about it? Not really.<br />
<br />
It's anecdotal evidence to provide, but with exception to account age, you and I share the same statistics<br />
<br />
But that isn't how it works, clearly. Every major WoW streamer has access to the beta. If that was absolutely how it worked, we'd see maybe 1 in 10 or 1 in 20 major streamers with access.</div></div><hr />

It can be both. Clearly streamer accounts are flagged because giving them priority access is a marketing function, and part of somebody's job will be to identify those accounts. The rest of the participants can be selected by an algorithm.</div></div><hr />

This happens on A LOT of servers that get released.<br />

The newest WotLk server was released and peaked at 6k people. Crashes, lag etc. And this was from people who use a third party server. After a few hours it was SOLVED.</div></div><hr />

Yea I'm just saying there's no reason to fret about not getting into this particular stress test since there's not much going on and there will be more to come. I totally remember having to wait a few hours for the kinks to work themselves out (in particular first night of Ulduar), it's no big deal and I expect there will be issues come launch that will work themselves out quickly too. I'm so hyped for launch anyway, the less I play beta probably for the best.</div></div><hr />

Those are the retail players shitting on other players. Most people who will play Classic could care less what happens to retail. It's the retail crowd that's worried and dreading the day Classic overtakes it in popularity.</div></div><hr />

Are you surprised? Blizzard has been full of shit for years, spouting lies left and right to try and save what little face they have left. Bottom line is they're just not the Blizzard of 10 years ago, too many developers wanting to force you to play their way instead of letting it be a MMORPG, too many developers telling the playerbase and stats that they're wrong, too many CMs actively telling the playerbase that they're idiots and commenting primarily in threads that don't even pertain to the game. The &quot;Blizzard Standard&quot; has gone really down hill, this is shown with the poor state that BFA released in, the attitude regarding Diablo Mobile, and the mass firing of staff(while letting people who didn't deserve to keep their jobs stay).</div></div><hr />
