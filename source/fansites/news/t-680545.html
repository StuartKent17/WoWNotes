Yay! Finally! Patch 3.3 introduced a handful of new mounts and one of them is probably one of the most interesting ever added to the game : Invincible (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/72286/invincible/).<br />
<br />
Who's Invincible? Let's ask WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Invincible): Invincible was the steed of Arthas Menethil, both in life and death. He was the skeletal steed that Arthas rode throughout Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. <br />
<br />
Until a few builds ago I wasn't really sure if it was going to be a player mount or not but the addition of the Invincible's Reins (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4625/invincibles-reins/) feat of strength definitely confirmed that. <br />
<br />
We do not know where it will drop but it's safe to assume that we'll have to defeat the Lich King in some crazy-hard difficulty mode. Also keep in mind that we won't fight him before months, it also means that players won't get this mount either and it could be modified before it hits the live servers. This is just a preview.<br />

Perky Pug Companion Pet<br />
I already posted a video of Perky Pug (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/70600/perky-pug/) a few weeks ago but one of the latest PTR build added an ... interesting animation to this pet. I suggest that you watch the whole video before you decide if he's still cute. <br />

World of Warcraft Magazine<br />
The World of Warcraft Official Magazine should be coming hot off the presses in December. We hope to have them shipped out shortly thereafter. We'll be sending an email out to all subscribers in the near future with additional details. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21334015479-world-of-warcraft-magazine.html))<br />

PvP Titles in Cataclysm<br />
In Cataclysm, we plan to make the old PvP titles available based on your performance in our upcoming rated Battleground system, similar to the current Arena titles which are based on your performance in the Arenas. Keep in mind, however, that Cataclysm is still relatively early in the development stages and this information is subject to change. We'll have more on the rated Battleground system and associated rewards in the months ahead. <br />
<br />
[...] I'm going to clarify my original post, as I don't believe it's been decided yet whether they'll be purchased with Arena points or Honor points, or if a specific Battleground rating is the only requirement to unlock them. There are no plans to make these titles available for real-world money. <br />
<br />
[...] We feel they're going to fit well with the new rated Battleground system. The titles were previously earned through a very cumbersome experience that didn't necessarily measure a player's PvP skill. With a new system for measuring performance in the Battlegrounds, we feel it's a good fit to award the honor titles to those who excel. We do not intend for the top titles to be earned in a trivial manner. It's going to be quite hard to get High Warlord or Grand Marshal; and not because it's going to require that someone plays in the Battlegrounds more than everyone else on their realm each week, but because it's going to require a very impressive win/loss ratio. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21333885156-confirm-this-rumor-blue.html))<br />
<br />
Rated Battlegrounds and Arena Points in Cataclysm<br />
The current plan is still for rated Battlegrounds to grant Arena points, though some rewards will require a certain rating from this system just as with the current Arena system. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21333885156-confirm-this-rumor-blue.html))<br />

that's great but where's the ingame video of the shaman tier &amp; shoulder animation..<br />

surely by this point it's all in the game files.<br />

<br />
Why? So you can say &quot;Look at me I've played longer than you&quot;? <br />
<br />
If its going to be harder to gain these titles than last time, its good enough reward for getting the old version keeping it even though you haven't stepped into new battlegrounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My guess is that's it's gonna be a 100% drop from Arthas heroic mode on 25 man, just like Mimiron's Head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm I guess I was wrong then because if that's the case then that would make it a guaranteed drop (in some super hard mode) unlike the ashes of alar which is an extremely rare drop.</div></div><hr />

The model is actuly a Undead mount.<br />
Lore is messed up again ;D.<br />
<br />
Why has so weird name from wiki:<br />
Arthas had considered naming the horse &quot;Snowfall&quot; or &quot;Starlight&quot;, but in the informal tradition of Lordaeron knights and nobles naming their steeds after a quality (Uther's was &quot;Steadfast&quot;, King Terenas' &quot;Courageous&quot;), he named the colt &quot;Invincible&quot;.<br />

<br />
Only thing that makes me sad about Invicible is the turd named &lt;Iownurfacerofl&gt; from &lt;XxXNoLifeKittensODoom&gt; that will be riding around on it and acting like a douchebag.<br />
<br />
Perky pug on the other hand isn't that hard to attain and the new animation is awesome... my dog does that.<br />
<br />
As for the PvP titles coming back well they should really make new one's for Cata I like the fact the old pvp titles are proof you've been around for awhile and it isn't fair for say ppl with GM to have it removed so they can grind it again.</div></div><hr />

Gaining the old ones wasn't so much a matter of skill and win/lose ratio, but back then BGs for the alli side were with 40 mins queue and you had to wait 5 hours just to enter AV..getting the title required full dedication for several weeks, maybe even months and all this for one blue set. Today you can roll fotm class, get your rotation on elitist jerks and dress in epics. I've earned my title! ;)</div></div><hr />

Translation: WHAAAAAAA I won't ever see Invincible drop, much less kill the LK 25man super hardcore mode and even if it drop I don't have anal sex with the GM so the only chance I have of even seeing it is when &lt;Igutmwadskilz&gt; sits over the well in Dalaran with it looking all smug and self satisfied.</div></div><hr />

Yup...they should remove the wings tbh, they don't look strong enough to get the massive armored ass of Arthas in the air, it just looks silly...make him fly with some kind of magic instead :P</div></div><hr />

this is still just a PTR build, i'm sure its just a rough animation. You don't actually expect blizzard to not touch up the animations a bit before the patch goes live?</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my server, there is a Night Elf Death Knight named Hehh or something that has the Ashes of Al'ar. Seeing that made a bit of myself die, along with my future children and my ancestors were shocked to life just to die again from the horrible sight. And yes, that is because he is a NIGHT ELF DK WITH A F***ING RETARDED NAME. You can't even be jealous of something like that. You just feel... really sad.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Invincible looks pretty badass although his animations are slightly... off?</div></div><hr />

This would be the 10000 Mount to look like the Forsaken horses (Baron Mount anyone?) &gt;:(<br />
<br />
This is the Horse of Arthas, so it should look really badass and unique. And it does. GJ Blizz and i&amp;#180;m hoping that this will be a really high end reward. I&amp;#180;m not sure whether it drops from Arthas 25m HM 100% like the Mimiron Head, or if it&amp;#180;ll be like the Ashes of Alar a really low droprate (0,0001% ^^).

Yeah because what you say has to be done!<br />
<br />
If you're referring to the mount model from WC3, that is an old grapic engine, i think they decided to give invincible the look of a skeletal horse so that players easily see it's an undead horse. With that raw graphic, rotted flesh looks similar to normal flesh and the difference wasn't big enough.<br />
And todays there are already skelett horses ingame and I doubt you would be pleased if arthas' drop mount looks like a common undead horse with more armor or something.<br />
imo it's really impressing.</div></div><hr />

perhaps you could illustrate the 'correct' flying animation for an undead horse with wings ?<br />
<br />
should take about 15 mins in 3ds Max for an expert such as yourself to throw together a basic untextured wing structure and show us how they should animate (you can ofc leave out the horse and any texturing) save it as an screencapped avi and upload it to youtube.</div></div><hr />

Actually, they're adding a Feat of Strength for Mimiron's Head in 3.3. I hope the Arthas encounter is similar to Yogg-Saron, where there is a hard mode and an extra hard mode. The mount should drop from the extra hard mode.</div></div><hr />

You know, I've read the story behind the horseman, I've read sleepy Hallow and at no point does it make sense for his mount to fly. And if you can't justify it, then you have no idea either. And since the hippogryph is a bird with 4 legs. This is a horse with wings.</div></div><hr />

I don't see what part of what he just told you, relates to whether or not the &quot;Sleepy Hallow&quot; horse flies or not.<br />
What he's trying to say is the HH mount has a riding animation while flying cause otherwise he would just glide through the air and it wouldn't make sense, but Invincible has wings so why would he be galloping in flight, which I agree, in this case doesn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

Because it would look stupid if it's legs were just hanging there. Do either of you know a damn thing about animation? If the legs kept still or just hung there, it would look weird, and if the legs were drawn inwards or bent back it would look even more unnatural.</div></div><hr />

What he's trying to say is the HH mount has a riding animation while flying cause otherwise he would just glide through the air and it wouldn't make sense, but Invincible has wings so why would he be galloping in flight, which I agree, in this case doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
The horseman mount has sure footing while galloping in the air, he does look like he is running on some invisible surface...However, the Invincible &quot;galloping&quot; is heavy and it drags down, not finding any footing. I would assume that a horse, maybe not that familiar with the sense of flight would feel it natural to gallop while moving in the air. That's just how I see it, though.</div></div><hr />

I knew they were going to implement BG titles again, but I didn't think they'd just reuse the old ones, I would rather have the new ones go up to something other than Grand-Marshal or High-Warlord to preserve what people did in vanilla. If they do reuse the old titles I damn hope its one hell of a grind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I still say it looks better if they did not run all the time.<br />
<br />
I like this flying animation.<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52k1ZncPF88<br />
<br />
Sure like you said, this is a bird not a horse like Invincible but animation wise I still think it looks better.<br />
I see your point and know what you are meaning but the relaxed legs comes more natural for me in animation.<br />
I hope they will change it to a more relaxed animation then the current but if I know blizzard right they will slack with all animation except for the non-combat pets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you're saying, just because someone made this animation for a flying horse in another game, it has to be the best animation around for a flying horse in any game.<br />
<br />
I don't have enough hands for the amount of facepalms I'd like to perform right now.<br />
<br />
I respect that you think this animation is better than the Hyppogryph animation (which I would prefer), but your reasoning is flawed big time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's just one example. I'm saying that any time a pegasus is animated (which is what Invincible is) it's always galloped through the air with the wings also flapping. But since God of War did the animation well, I used it to prove a point.</div></div><hr />

I think it's very silly to suspend something like war titles for something in the past. For one thing, half the people who earned Grand Marshal or High Warlord could very well not be playing anymore. Second off, this was something that was suspended before TBC came out, which excludes a LOT of people.<br />
<br />
Finally, let's just think about how a current army works. If a soldier does exemplary work on the field, they're usually promoted. Soon enough, they'll become lieutenant, colonel, general, and all the other ranks. One soldier may have gotten his rank of general through a warzone, or he got it through his work as a lifetime armyman. Either way, that still makes him a general.<br />
<br />
So just because this new system would make it harder to tell if a High Warlord is a High Warlord from Vanilla WoW or a High Warlord through the new system...that still doesn't mean the glory won't be there still. We especially can't really say how it'll end up until the system actually comes in and we see how difficult it'll actually be to get the titles.<br />
<br />
Though if we could get new ranks to replace the high-end ones, that won't be a bad thing, either. Still sounds silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the Pegasus segment from God of War II, a game praised for many things, including animation. Watch it's legs. It gallops in mid air.<br />
<br />
The galloping animation of Pegasus looks awesome, however it just feels weird on Invincible.<br />
<br />
I personally think it's because of the legs, Pegasus has longer and slimmer legs while Invincible's leg is much shorter and rounder, thus making the whole 'Galloping' animation look weird. All in all through, it's still an awesome mount.<br />
<br />
Also...any1 knows what's the music in the mount video?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirque</div><div class="date">2009-11-25, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because it would look stupid if it's legs were just hanging there. Do either of you know a damn thing about animation? If the legs kept still or just hung there, it would look weird, and if the legs were drawn inwards or bent back it would look even more unnatural.<br />
<br />
<br />
Use your imagination. &quot;Stillness&quot; in animation refers to something that has no movement whatsoever, like you'd draw a picture and move it from left to right. It's the old animated Smurf or Tintin cartoons where 80% of the screen was still. Not interesting.<br />
<br />
These people, and I'm with the, request for the feet of the horse to not run like mad on air, but instead have it in a floatlike animation. Imagine the leg somewhat bended to the back, and add some movement to that to make it actually appear as if the horse is flying/drifting/floating. You can do this by making the lower part of the leg move up and down, the upper part of the leg right to left, and add animation to the hooves as well. It would look amazing.<br />
<br />
That would look more natural, to a winged horse, in my opinion, than the way the horse frantically runs through the air as it is now. For the Headless Horseman's Mount, this is a different story, as its movement through the air is created by his galopping through it, like the reindeers of a Santa in bad hollywood movies. When movement is created by wings, however, gallopping looks unnecessary, weird, and unnatural.<br />
<br />
Edit to comment on posts above me: The reason, to me, the horse's running looks weird is because he's running as fast as a pony would, his legs going too fast for the speed he's making through the air. Calming the speed at which he's gallopping would for me fix the greatest issue I have with it. The Pegasus in that youtube also has its legs move at a speed that makes sense for the speed its making, that and its not as bulky as Invincible, the pegasus is slender, fast, beautiful; Invincible is strong, bulky, and a wall of a horse.</div></div><hr />

It'd look more awkward if the legs were just hanging there and remained completely still. <br />
<br />
<br />
While this is true, there IS such a thing as over-doing it. Personally, I like Invincible's animations EXCEPT for the movement of the front legs as he flies. They move TOO much, and make it look like his front legs are boneless and made of rubber instead. This, I believe is because his front legs seem to bend both forwards AND backwards at the joint, when they should bend only backwards. It looks somewhat like someone took the animation for another model (Hippogryph or Gryphon) changed it for Invincible so the front legs curved backwards, but forgot to delete a few keyframes so they now curve forward as well. I think it would look better is they swapped out the leg movements for those of the Horseman's mount. Or at least just fixed up what they have here. <br />
<br />
I mean, I know Invincible's legs were broken (twice) but does his flying animation HAVE to reflect that??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't know what you were expecting, but they look pretty darn good. I would love to see all winged mounts shift to a swoop animation when they are descending... say anything over 20 degrees of pitch. But that's pretty minor and not specific to this mount. <br />
<br />
Perhaps you should actually provide some details on what doesn't look right? Even down to the rippling of the wing surfaces and the tail flapping gently in the breeze of flight, the movements seemed natural and fluid.</div></div><hr />

First off, if I'm not mistaken, you get the Pug from Pugging with 100 random players or is it 100 times. I though I saw that somewhere. And second, I would think a dog &quot;scoots&quot; because his/her ass itches (also could be other reasons). That's what I would do :P. A little off topic but I heard once from a friend that his dog ate a frisbie and it was hanging out the dogs ass so he scooted to try to fix his obviously huge problem hahaha</div></div><hr />

<br />
should take about 15 mins in 3ds Max for an expert such as yourself to throw together a basic untextured wing structure and show us how they should animate (you can ofc leave out the horse and any texturing) save it as an screencapped avi and upload it to youtube.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh, you touch´d my heart...just kidding... roflmao ... nc<br />
its so hard to accept the fact it has rly weird animation? :D carry on, life has even much more hidden surprises<br />
btw. if i would be a programer you would feel pwned... i spare u from that bad feeling, kid<br />
<br />
to skip your next lamne-flame post,... here is my answer:<br />
<br />
find (in real-life, an video on web will be enough, dont run into jungle) a bat, or whatever has similar wings as Invincible, and watch it when it flies, watch the wing floping... and if there will be some-animal with such floping i will bow before u and tell u ... very well u r right and my comment was totaly wrong, u pwnd me...<br />
till then... stfu if u can just flame nerd and has no idea about realistic wing floping<br />
<br />
btw. to all those who say the animations are all OK... u know a lot about animations... &quot;rly a lot&quot;<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
here is something for your lame-head to learn from:<br />
compare it to the Invincible´s &quot;floping&quot; (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA8RFiEF7rY)<br />
was too quick? wrong angle? here u have it in slow motion (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjIwXRLwadU&amp;feature=related)</div></div><hr />

I agree. Its pretty ugly. What is that....bat wings on an undead horse? Where is the synergy I don't get it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drukai</div><div class="date">2009-11-25, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think, from an aesthetic standpoint, the wild/mad enraged flailing from Invincible should be toned down, but not removed. It does look angry, it does look aggressive, but it also looks a bit silly with how large its aerial stride is. This is an undead horse with a lot of pent up aggression, its been injured, maimed, killed, and it keeps getting back up to carry Arthas into battle, it needs to look fast and strong, and I think it accomplishes that.<br />
<br />
I do hope that they pull its head forward as if its charging, lower the swing on the frontal hoof stride, fix the ground idle wing art so that its not clipping, and scale it to be a decent amount larger than your average pony (Something like a Clydesdale as opposed to a moppish pony), but overall its a beautiful mount.</div></div><hr />

Not necessarily. The general description of a pony is an equine under 14.2 hands (58 inches). Connemara ponies, for example, aren't stocky. Some smaller horses, like fjords, aren't ponies even though they're that size, but are stocky. Even some draft breeds can be considered stocky, and draft blood in their lines is the reason most people equate stocky to ponies.<br />
<br />
Also, where are people getting that Invincible is a pony (haven't read the Arthas book yet)? WoWWiki doesn't mention anything about the Balnir horses being ponies, and it'd seem strange that Arthas would have been given a pony...</div></div><hr />

Yeah BUT, *BOOK SPOILERS INCOMING* when he assaulted Silvermoon and confronted Darthremar Sunstrider (I sure hope I spelled it right) the old elf brakes Invincible's legs and Arthas goes WTFPWN with rage, killing him instantly.

To the people who are arguing about lore and whether Arthas as the Lich King still has feelings, he most certainly DOES. They're not particularly NICE ones 99.9% of the time, but he's not a sociopath. If he was, we'd have been screwed since the first invasion back when Naxx arrived in Vanilla.<br />

SPOILERS: We know that the only thing holding the Scourge back from absolutely obliterating the planet is the tiny fragment of Arthas' good nature that remains.

That's because of feat of strenght - there isn't one for mimiron's head, is it? But there is for A'lar, so I guess it will be ridiculously rare drop, but available for everyone. <br />
<br />
<br />
there is a feat for mimiron's head in 3.3</div></div><hr />

<br />
Meaning there'll probably be so rare that in the entire population of WoW, the only ones who'll have a chance at access to it are uber guilds. Not only that, of those that will be able to do the fight, probably only 1 of those will get it. <br />
<br />
Just my guess.<br />
<br />
Amazing looking mount, even though it the patched on wings don't seem very lore'ish. But he's the Lich King, I'd imagine he's got access to some uber magics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last note, the pug pet, animations look amazing. I wonder how it will be gotten? Will you have to PUG for the pug?</div></div><hr />

I really hope that isn't the final animation.<br />
<br />
The titles: I hope that they're as difficult as the original titles were or they're completely new titles. If neither of these happen it's a slap in the face for the people who worked hard to earn them originally. Before people start flaming I started playing in TBC and still understand how much effort they took to earn, anyone putting that much effort into something deserves respect for it. High Warlord is like an Original Scarab Lord (e.g. not new-server-jumpers).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">btu10</div><div class="date">2009-11-26, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just an FYI:<br />
<br />
Many small dogs &quot;scoot&quot; because of swollen glands around their, er, anus. It's actually quite uncomfortable for the little guys and they should get taken to the vet regularly if they are scooting. (Pretty sure the gland problem came from deformities/mutations from such selective breeding for &quot;toy&quot; dogs).<br />
<br />
Since its a computer game and used to signify a pug wiping (epic lol) who cares, but if you see a little fulla IRL scooting you should suggest to their owner to sort it out; not very nice for the dog.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FlacidGladiator</div><div class="date">2009-11-26, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'll note that the animation for Invincible is the old hippogriff mount animation. So essentially, Invincible is a hippogriff with a new skin. This also explains why the hippogriff will have a land walk animation finally in 3.3. They're using the same modules for the different mounts and since a hippogriff is technically the closest thing to what Invincible is, both mounts will use the same animations routines. The mount is visually impressive but unless youre an orc or a forsaken, youre likely going to look ridiculous on this mount. My luck though, I'll see some goddamn space goat or night elf riding it or even worse, a gnome, and whatever cool factor this mount will have will flush like last night's beef-n-bean burrito surprise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you have been reading recently on MMO-Champion, or within the past month, information about how this pet was announced through pugging 100 dungeons using the new LFG tool.<br />
<br />
Invincible, for me, looks nothing short of incredible, truly loving the sturdiness of the hooves to the span of the wings.<br />
<br />
As for Perky Pug, CUTE! Much want :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draelan</div><div class="date">2009-11-26, 02:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I read the book and Invincible died at a young age. Invincible was on the cusp of becoming a Horse when he died.<br />
<br />
<br />
I read the book, and as far as I recall, that is NOT what happened. Invincible was a adult when he died. The book details one incident where Arthas tried riding Invincible before Invincible was fully grown. It didn't go well, but Invincible came out of it with only a scratch after panicking and taking off, and Arthas was scolded that he could have permanently crippled Invincible by doing that. <br />
<br />
Invincible doesn't die until later in the book, on a snowy winter day when Arthas is out riding him. (Which, since he got scolded for riding him when he wasn't fully grown, would indicate that Invincible was fully grown at this point.) Arthas guided Invincible to jump from an embankment they'd jumped from many times before (Also indicating that he'd been able to ride Invincible for a while.) but this time, Invincible slipped on a patch of ice and fell, breaking his front legs and other serious injuries. Arthas had to drive his sword through Invincible's heart to put him out of his misery, since he wasn't a paladin at the time and couldn't heal his steed. (This was a big contributing factor to why Arthas decided to become a paladin.) <br />
<br />
So, while Invincible may have been a young adult, he was definitely an adult.</div></div><hr />

Starts with model without wings and as you learn flying and you are in flying zone, you get the model with wings. please. /vote for awesome BoA mount.<br />
<br />
<br />
in cata you can fly everywhere in the game. but it wouldn't be that fun if it was a BoA yeah it would be nice, but EVERYONE would have it, so uncool lol. <br />
<br />
(didn't bother to see if anyone said anything about this...so lol)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caerdwyn</div><div class="date">2009-11-26, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought that mount was amazing until I saw it galloping through the air. It seems weird because any form of pegasus doesn't move its legs at all as it flies, and it just seems unnatural to look at. Not that having an undead horse with wings is natural...<br />
<br />
The fact that the pug is called a perky pug should have clued us in to his behaviour. That he scratches behind the ear is an indicator that he's going to have to scratch in other places too, right?<br />
<br />
Bringing back the old titles is a good idea. I could never exhibit the skill to get my Knight-Captain title again, so I'm happy that I have it, but for those that are serious about battlegrounds, good luck to them on getting the upper echelon PvP titles.</div></div><hr />

Invincible needs improvement though. I mean, it runs in the air, the wings fold irregularly, and when it fly's the whole body does &quot;the worm&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I've got an idea though, just like normal drakes soaring for a little while on flight, how about this one doing the same? like gryphons or drakes soaring for a few seconds and keeps galloping after.</div></div><hr />
