<br />
I'd rather see it perform a Whirlwind every X second (Deep Wounds for Arms / Procs meat cleaver for Fury / Defensive Steroid for Prot) and if the Warrior walks over the weapon they can pick it up to perform a single Whirlwind equal to X% of the time / damage remaining on Ravager, shaving off X seconds on the cooldown based on when they performed the super Whirlwind. <br />
<br />
But Alpha is Alpha. <br />
<br />
Hopefully several of them change to a per specialization basis, the pure dps classes are in a dire need of this.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, Ravager should replace Heroic Throw to reduce ability bloat.</div></div><hr />

I can tell you that for mages at least it'll be faceroll mode on. Welcome to casualcraft.</div></div><hr />

I really hope i'm not understanding this....but it seems to me that pallys will need to &quot;Seal Swap&quot; in order to get buffed?<br />

Those DK ability names :o<br />

Next expansion; Oblivion, Frostmourne hungers, Summon Galakrond.<br />

Love all the abilities they have lined up, except Rogues because I don't really play that class. :/</div></div><hr />

I dont mind getting a bit more to do on my paladin but steal swapping is not what i had in mind.. would be extremely hard with the 20 seconds.. and a 6 sec judge with GCD would have maybe 8 seconds on the first before changing to the second JoR / JoT<br />

<br />
Probably. If you actually read all the notes from tonight or spent 20 seconds researching online you would have known like the rest of us they are pruning the hell out of abilities.<br />
<br />
Where have you been hiding, dude? lol</div></div><hr />

ummm...where did you get that from? From what I see the only talent that even has the same name is RoP, and the only one who might use that is as far as I can tell would be arc since it doesn't regen mana, but doesn't replace evocation now, which only arc. can use. Incanter's flow seems to be better for fire and frost, being that it doesn't seem to limit movement and has equal or better +sp 2/3 of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said before that something like 12 (don't remember exactly, could be more) mage talents got changed / replaced. We do not know all the changes to existing talents yet, so hold your horses.</div></div><hr />

In all fairness i don't feel retri paladins need any more abilities, i personally feel that a paladin of any spec should never be sat around doing no abilities with all of their blessings they can provide the raid. I personally don't want this change for us to persist through seal change, just stick to the one seal and upgrade our blessings a little. I may be wrong, and it maybe the best things for paladins, i hope i am!</div></div><hr />

As small as their individual boosts are, I think the 'remains through changing seals' is just a convenience, not a 'forced' swap...</div></div><hr />

Haven't checked much of the other talents so can't say, but I guess I will just give you some more time.<br />

Beacon is that ability that everyone thinks is overpowered. When you mention beacon to holy paladin, he just goes &quot;mmmm... more overhealing&quot;</div></div><hr />
