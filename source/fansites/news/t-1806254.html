<br />
Doomhammer is regarded as a giant hero, despite the death and suffering he created.<br />
<br />
Orcs are weird and seem to get a free pass with Blizzard, except for Garrosh, who was butchered and fucked about so much he doesn't even count anymore.</div></div><hr />

Archimonde's appearance alone was infinitely better than anything they churned out with Dragon Shit. Bonus points for Thrall not being involved at all, let alone the stupid &quot;age of mortals&quot; garbage.</div></div><hr />

Lol, are you talking about the one with Mannoroth, Garrosh and Grom? That's not even the same thing. They've never* done pure CG for an ending cutscene, ever.</div></div><hr />

Gul'dan broke Grommash when he told Grom that Garrosh was his son. I noticed it pretty clearly. He broke. Why cage a brokenhearted father after he tried to repent for his sins?</div></div><hr />

It seems as though we don't know if either Archimonde (who didn't die in the Nether) or Gul'dan are dead. The status of both is left ambiguous, there are no repercussions for Grommash and now Draenor seems to be established as more MU than AU with Yrel's speech.<br />
<br />
Ugh.<br />
<br />
At least it means the next, and hopefully much better, expansion comes quicker.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pateuvasiliu</div><div class="date">2015-06-24, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So... everyone just forgets Grommash started World War Draenor, not Gul'dan? Gul'dan only betrayed him when he was losing. And why is Grom suddenly cool with us? Unless Thrall showed him the complete vision of the main future and not the one manipulated by Garrosh he should still hate our guts lol.<br />
<br />
And how the fuark do we kill freaking Archimonde? Malfurion needed hours of voodoo and 2 billion wisps to blow him up.</div></div><hr />

Also welcome to the end of WoD.. guess no more patch (I would say 97%) the story is done.</div></div><hr />

Remember how it took the power of the Sunwell and a whole lot of time to summon Kil'Jaeden or the massive amount of preparation and magic required to summon Archimonde back in WC3? Either Gul'dan stole all the power from the nerfed warlocks or Blizz just screwed up the lore again.</div></div><hr />

They've said these were the final steps of the legendary quest. So it's probably the last raid patch at very least. Maybe we'll get another tiny patch but i wouldnt hold my breath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they retcon this cinematic and tell us Gromm is the bad guy like they told us last freaking summer, then WHY? What did you foreshadow or give us to make us dislike him? Darth Vader destroyed an entire planet of millions in New Hope on command, but we looked for his redemption two movies later because we were given loads of backstory that let us believe he had some good in him, thanks to Luke's unwavering belief that his father could be redeemed. Basically, they redeemed him in this closing, but we're going to be told to kill him because he needs to die. String these designers up by their heels. Awful storytelling. Let them go back to the bargain bin of novel writing where they belong. They have zero clue how to tell a story anymore. Metzen is a master storyteller, and yet he's so far removed I'm positive his job is just to sign off anymore. I'm disgusted by the whole thing.<br />
<br />
The only thing they're looking at anymore is the bottom line, granted them by the legion of fans who will buy anything they puke out and call story. Time to get back to the lore and install someone who knows how to build sympathy and plot. Again, I'm disgusted.<br />
<br />

And the next xpac is called the Lich'dan King - where we go to Northrend - no not a time travel guys - just an alternative timeline/universe.<br />
<br />
The xpac after it will be Mists of Gul'dan (where Gul'dan is the Sha corrupting Grommash) ... where Grom is time traveling from AU Dreanor to AU MoG to his alternative son (Grommash ) so that he can travel at the end to the AAU draenor to warn Gromm ... an eternal cycle and a playground for new untold stories ... a chance to reboot the WoW universe ...<br />
<br />
From now on every xpac is just a blown patch - so blizzard can earn more money by selling patches as xpacs and deliver more frequently - just jumping between &quot;Draenor - Northrend - Pandaria&quot; - rehash and rebrush ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was going to mention that. The additional PvP season actually convinces me that this is it for Warlords of Draenor because, if there was only one season, then the next would come with another patch.<br />
<br />
The fact there are two seasons tells you (well, it tells me) that there’s going to be another season, but not another patch prior to it happening. We’ve just hit the end of expansion lull while we wait for the next one, and it’s likely going to be around a year of 6.2.<br />
<br />
6.2 is it. Hazzikostas saying “we’ve more story to tell after this” was either a lie, or a reference to 7.0.</div></div><hr />

As soon as someone writes up a detailed story compilation of what happened I won't even have to come back before the next expansion (and probably not even then..).

Which would defeat the purpose of making us play a bunch of heroes. I do admit I'd like to see something like a wave based fight that just ends up having a cinematic kicking in that signals the end of the fight, something like say Gul'dan Tomb of Sargeras Cavern of Times style, knowing that Gul'dan pretty much died overwhelmed by demons in Sargeras' tomb, that the fight could have something like *Survive X amount of waves* <br />
<br />
But ultimately, the game is designed around having us be heroes overcoming adversity, not &quot;Welp, the heroes weren't good enough, that sucks&quot;</div></div><hr />

That they'd tone down the pointless AvH conflict a bit in face of a greater thread is just obvious. From a plot perspective these wars make not even an ounce of sense. That they play buddy with the war criminal Hellscream though, that is a completely different topic. When watching the vid I thought it might have been better to throw Grom in the exploding portal to recreate his original demise by green energy/flame.<br />
<br />
As for the bunch of people that keep repeating &quot;but grom is supposed to be final boss&quot;. If you still haven't realized that blizzard makes the details up as they go, you are living in a dream world. He was the major adversary throughout the expansion as far as i can see, that some blue got the detail wrong of him actually dying or being the literal boss is something blizzard hardly shrugs at. They can always claim it was ment in a meta physical way and it was all about making him a &quot;good&quot; (genocidal) guy. Of course it isn't necessarily the actual ending and they can come up with another contrived way to spin a mini dungeon/raid fight on him. But given the current theme of the expansion and I'm not so sure tbh. Time will tell, but I certainly won't get my hopes up.</div></div><hr />

The only thing i can say positively is that we are taking the cinematic out of context. There may be some lore we are missing as yet in HFC arch fight or Tanaan and there will be more after this. Maybe it doesn't make sense because its not the complete story as yet? <br />

This story suffers in the same way that most prequels suffer. By knowing the characters and what already happened to them, we setup our own high expectations which are never going to live up to what actually happens. (Star Wars prequels I am looking at you.) This story had limitless potential, but let's face it Blizzard went as simple and minimalist with it as they could. From a lore perspective this expansion was probably meant to introduce newer players to classic characters, and give us a way to play through the original world of Draenor, I think it was intended to help setup more relevance for the Warcraft movie next year.<br />

You know all Mages can technically transmute themselves like that. Not just Medivh. Both Medivh and Khadgar are infinitely more powerful than a player Mage, and its not a long shot to think they can do the same things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've felt for awhile that Blizzard wants out of this expansion. Whether the setting is boxing their creativity in (since they can't go crazy with designs as its an established World), or something else, I just think they want to be done and move on. I'm willing to give them a chance with the next expansion to see if the magic is still there. <br />
<br />
As for Khadgar and the raven - he does that if you pick the magic.. house.. thing.. in Talador, so we've seen that before. It led to a lot of speculation if he was really Medivh. Which apparently not. And apparently he is really a good guy and isn't going to turn on us. None of the main NPC characters died this expansion, and there wasn't a twist with Khadgar. I'm both relieved and disappointed.<br />
<br />
So, if Draenor is going to rebuild, will there be an option for everyone suffering on Outland to travel to Draenor? I would hope so!<br />
<br />
All I know is that it's been 7 months since Grommash was yelling at me that he would find and kill me as I ran away from Tanaan (which was pretty awesome), and now he's.. standing with us.. cheering.. saying Draenor is free. Ooookay.</div></div><hr />

he was promised glory and victory by Garrosh and he paid the price. He was mislead and then back stabbed by Gul Dan. Lets be real he was a proud warrior that wanted orcs to be free from slavery. He wasn't personally responsible for 1/2 the shit that happened.</div></div><hr />

Prior to Wod launch Chris Metzen did indeed say Grommash would be the final boss, but when asked in another interview later but just before launch why an orc is again the final boss they said it won't be just an orc.<br />
Hence here we are now with Archimonde, non orc.<br />
Again prior to WoD launch during beta Blizzard had a blue statement they are moving to do 2 content patch cycle expansion. What was so hard to understand about that 6.2 is the final patch? Which would mean 6.1 was the first cycle and now 6.2 is the second which would then mean this is the end of Wod.<br />
Now a later interview with Ion revealed that WoD is a 2 part expansion and they have more of the story to tell. Here we go again with the contradiction. If it's supposed to be 2 cycle expansion why isn't the story done? Or is the story just pre expansion hype and event.<br />
Well looking at the Archimonde end cinematic that holds true. Demon as Archimonde can only truly be killed in the Nether where the demons reside so he ain't dead yet.<br />
That story probably will continue once we get to Sargeras, cause who else is he going to have as his penultimate bosses other than he's 2 most powerful lieutenants Archimonde and Kil'jaeden. <br />
And Gul'dan is not dead, the cinematic showes that he's thrown through the portal not killed, did people actually watch the same cinematic I did.<br />
Looking at the history of Warcraft and the non AU lore, things have pretty much turned out 100% as many many people predicted prior launch.<br />
All you can say that has been the most predictable expansion ever.<br />
<br />
Even the end when Yrel promises that now that we helped to save Draenor, they will return the favor.<br />
That is so transparent that Azeroth is next and Gul'dan continues his plot there, who we gonna call? Not Ghostbusters for sure, our buddies in AU Draenor.<br />
<br />
My prediction still stands that whatever patch number the next content holds, it will contain Gul'dan dying in Tomb of Sargeras. <br />
Said that prior launch and everything else has become true that was said back then.<br />
<br />
Only thing is if the next content coming is considered 6.3 Draenor continues or pre 7.0 labeled as Draenor continues in Azeroth remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
The part of Grommash turning between 2 cinematics.. I hope Hellfire Citadel holds the answer to that. Not holding my breath but would assume the answer lays in there.<br />
Anyway not too fussed about Grommash, he was never going to be the bad guy to begin with, it was always Gul'dan.</div></div><hr />

I think it's more that we don't want 6.2 to be the last WoD patch, because it means we really are going to start paying $50 a year for this game plus $15 a month. Do you feel like you got the same amount of content and experience out of this expansion as prior ones? I definitely don't.<br />

<br />
The trick is to quit after 1-2 months following a major content update. That way you save all the money. In the drought periods at least.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
In regards to yearly updates though, I still don't see them actually pulling it off. If anything it became clear that they can barely feed the current content hunger. Unless they already have the next expansion 50% completed, and this is the very reason the content so far was lackluster, I don't see them actually coming up with a new expansion before the end of next spring.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard doesent have the chops to write fucking time travel/multi dimension. Few people have, even fucking star trek writters failed 50% of the time when playing with those.

As for Khadgar turning into a raven it's because of his staff. It was medivh's Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian. And gul'dan has a good setup. Being possessed archimonde and being sent somewhere, probably to gather reinforcements of the Legion. This opens up using the content previously unused but announced at BlizzCon. All in all not a bad patch. You can't complain about not having anything to do, and the day after getting new stuff, complain that you don't like it or it's not enough. This by far has not been the best expansion but it has been the worst either.</div></div><hr />

Dear god I hope it's not the next expansion because I am so over it at this point. Gul'dan is now in the Nether I guess? I dunno. Maybe we'll get a 6.3 (6.4?) mini-raid and be done with the Legion.<br />
<br />
That was a super lackluster cinematic if it's intended to be the end of the expansion. I guess it works for the end of the raid, though. But WTF is up with Grom? You don't get to be a hero, Grom, this all started because of you trying to take over Azeroth, you dummy.</div></div><hr />

Right, that would be different how? Garrosh was super corrupt by the old gods. Face it, Grom is not really the last boss. They probably said it to keep it a surprise. They couldn't avoid saying there would be a last boss. They tried that in MoP and people flipped their shit. So, they said Grom since it would seem the obvious choice anyway with the opening cinematic. Bait and switch.<br />

<br />
People just want something to be angry about. They can't look at subtle storytelling and understand what's going on. They can't tell good from bad from gray area. They just see what's in front of them, right in their faces. They can't read between the lines. People need the story force fed down their face or they don't get it. Then, they cry about mary sues and boring characters and generic stories. If things don't happen how they wanted it or they don't understand it, they belittle it. This is the internet, so we'll just see a lot of the brainless bad mouthers bad mouthing. They've likely never had an independent thought and are just full of bile and grime. They'll attack anyone who disagrees as stupid and fanboy.<br />

You're mixing so many different elements together, plus you don't know how to use a contraction. Either way, there's more that needs to be discussed about their recent comment on demons. Speculation on that point really won't do any good right now. Also, Arch's body in WC3 didn't just go away.

My thoughts are that since Kadgar thinks &quot;this was only the beginning&quot; and knowing Blizzards hesitation with finishing off &quot;important&quot; lore characters I think (and again, this is based only on my own interpretations alone) is that since Archimonde said &quot;Guldan, you made a pact&quot; (meaning they are &quot;bound&quot; together somehow) that Archimonde &quot;transferred&quot; his &quot;consciousness&quot; into Guldan and then &quot;returned&quot; to the Twisting Nether to come back if we ever get another Burning Legion like (incl. Sargaras) expansion.<br />
<br />
Again, these are just my random thoughts...</div></div><hr />

Right, let the fans write the story cause you don't like where the story is going. Not everyone agrees with you, and just because people cry on the internet doesn't mean you actually have a lot of people that feel the same way you do. You guys just cry a lot and loudly.</div></div><hr />

Either way, there's more that needs to be discussed about their recent comment on demons. Speculation on that point really won't do any good right now. Also, Arch's body in WC3 didn't just go away. His bones were on the tree for years until the druids cleaned the area up.<br />
<br />
Ingame his bones were only present when Hyjal was not reachable by players. They forgot that in wc3 he explodes, there are no bones he literally just bust up in flames. In WoW battle of mount hyjal cavern of time, he also explodes. So they remembered he left no bones behind. There is no speculation, they didnt know what the hell do to with it. Twisting nether can link all dismensions without having thousands of Archimonde and KJ running around? If theres only 1 of each, once they die they are dead and if they dont die, the &quot;go back to the nether&quot; death needs to be consistent.<br />

Time wise it doesent even make sense. Blizzcon would be when the next content patch would land. But it wont be, because its been one year for their new expansion plan. What puzzles me with you guys, believing in another raid tier, is that we were told there was only gona be 2 raid tier for their 1 year per expac to work.. Do you guys kinda blank that one from your minds?</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a difference in story taking a turn thats disliked, and one that is being written badly. <br />
<br />
Think of Eddward Stark's death. <br />
<br />
Death by decapitation, vs death by tripping over his shoelaces and falling down a long flight of stairs to his death.<br />
Both have the outcome of him being dead, but one serves a purpose for setting arks in motion and painting a vivid picture of character to come in the show/book. <br />
<br />
However, thats not to say dying for a cause gives a free pass. Look at Kairoz, all that build up and mystery, and then just gets killed off instantly after being used. Using characters purely as a plot device is a pretty big tell of bad writing. You need to fully flesh out character, what do they do, why do they do what they do, and what do they think on the entire matter at hand.<br />
You need have the reader/player invested. For all intents and purposes, Kairoz could have been replaced with a magic horn (https://youtu.be/0GLxejJ-yYQ?t=445) that brought back all the orc warlords from the dead. (Then we at least wouldn't have do deal with this &quot;Legion transcends all realities&quot; non-sense.)</div></div><hr />

I said when this expac was announced it was just an executive pushed filler expansion to promote the movie by introducing WoW players who didn't play the RTS games to Durotan, Grom, Garona (was the legendary follower of course, wonder why?), Blackhand etc who are in the movie. I knew the story would be lame, shitty written filler and end fast because this whole expansion was nothing but a promotional tool and an easy nostalgia cash grab. And here we are, clearly the the last raid of the expansion.<br />
<br />
Now they are trying to move to an expansion cycle of 12-16 months after raising the price another $10 for no damn reason (fanboys talk bout inflation but every other game hasn't changed their prices because they know the average persons purchasing power isn't going up as the wealth gap increases, $60 for AAA release, $40 for expansions still standard). They're losing subs, so how do they try to keep their greedy execs and share holders happy? By milking their loyal customers even more. So now you get to pay $50 every year on top of your sub fee, to get half assed expansions like this one with less content than ever and only two raid tiers. <br />
<br />
And fanboys will STILL defend Blizzard, even when they've clearly stopped giving a damn about WoW and trying to revitalize it or put the work into a proper sequel but instead only see it as a way to milk their current fans for as much as possible before the ship fully sinks, hence charging you another $50, on top of your $15 per month, as often as they can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know that depends on how you look at it, as it is i don't care how Archimonde was/will be defeated. as for Guldan, from what i saw in the video he was thrown through the portal that Archimonde came through. Furthermore if the first fight with Teron Gore this expac was anything to go by, as there isn't a body then Guldan is most likely still alive, Most likely being tortured to the brink of death by his masters. Now as for that cinematic being a direct link to another expac they can go through the route of the next expac being one about the burning legion, and it taking place where ever they are from.<br />

And what makes you say that. there is nothing in that video that says its over. all i saw was the final boss for Hellfire Citadel dying and the main antagonist for the patch being forcibly thrown threw the active portal to who knows where. there is still plenty of room for another patch or two. you just have to keep your mind open.</div></div><hr />

Yea, them charging you $50 on top of $15 a month for poorer quality expansions with only two tiers in them and apparently 1 tier of 5 mans, super exciting. How gullible are you people? The only reason for faster expansions to get $50 out of your pocket more often, you're not getting the same amount of content for the same price (lol they even charged $10 more than every other expansion for this one), you're paying the same price more often for less.</div></div><hr />

Time to buy Blizzard stock. Record profit.<br />
<br />
For the people who think this is NOT final movie.<br />
By looking at how lazy Blizzard lately, do you think Blizzard will make 2 ending movies?</div></div><hr />

SIGH. Pls just kill off Gul'dan and make the next expansion all about pirates and a world map that is made of 10 islands.. We can have the whole shabang, naga's and pirates and underwater caves and monsters aswell as booty bay themed maps with looong wooden bridges in between them. We have the perfect layout for it now with the shipyard's. <br />
<br />
Imagine a whole expansion with the pirate inspired gear and loot and the kul'tiras pirates among others. Man it would be awesome!. World of warcraft : Fury of the south sea<br />
<br />
Oh well.. another orc expansion SIGH!!</div></div><hr />

Somehow a pirate expansion would seem rather weak-sauce after all the orc legion thing.. even if you'd throw in a few naga and old gods for good measure.</div></div><hr />

Ye, devs said Grommash will be the final boss. But things can change ya know! They have said it 10 months ago. also, he may die in 5 man or something much like Kael'thas. What will they do with Grommash anyway? is there even a way to continue this stupid kids cartoon story without making it sound even dumber then it is right now?<br />
<br />
AND what happened to the days of actual normal and sane story telling like in Warcraft 3? Is Metzen alive?</div></div><hr />

This whole story is fu**d up... I still cannot understand how mage portals work between the two parallel universe where the time is not in the same state...<br />

What the fuck is going on with Deathwing's downfall and Mists and oh god, Warlords now, idk man. They had so many options but they jus failed. 6.2 could've made it perfect, it was so easy to do so and they failed.<br />
<br />
They are afraid to make any complex storylines. I don't know why though. I suppose they need idiots to follow along</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unholyground</div><div class="date">2015-06-25, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, them charging you $50 on top of $15 a month for poorer quality expansions with only two tiers in them and apparently 1 tier of 5 mans, super exciting. How gullible are you people? The only reason for faster expansions to get $50 out of your pocket more often, you're not getting the same amount of content for the same price (lol they even charged $10 more than every other expansion for this one), you're paying the same price more often for less.<br />
<br />
Personally WoW saves me ass loads of money in the run of a year that I don't have to spend on other games, so to me more expansions quicker is better, also they stated they do not like making major class changes during expansions anymore which sucks for me because that is the funnest part of the game when they heavily modify a class to make it play different and that will only happen with new expansions now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Retread storylines HOOOOOOOOO!<br />
<br />
It sure seems like they set up for AU Guldan to get all Lich King'd again.<br />
It was MU Ner'zhul that became the original Lich King, not MU Gul'dan. (Grr, I really dislike having to make a distinction now between MU and AU...)</div></div><hr />

He was killed in both since the TBC raid was a &quot;flashback&quot;. We were sent back in time to make sure history occurred like it should have.</div></div><hr />

I thought guldan would survive for the next expac but this seems to me they're just throwing him out but not outright killing him so the option to bring him back is there. Which means he may come back someday but not for the next expac. I'm glad Grom didn't die though. Everyone expected him to die fighting Archimonde originally.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkhallows</div><div class="date">2015-06-25, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually thought it was fine. It was worlds better than the piece of shit we got at the end of Cataclysm. But Cataclysm will probably always be my least favorite expansion, so there's that. The only thing that left a bad taste in my mouth was Grom's &quot;Draenor is free!&quot; spiel and the fact that there were Draneei cheering for him. Like what? What the fuck? He started all this nonsense, or at the very least led it. Aren't there going to be any repercussions or are Durotan and Grom just going to be buddies now? <br />
<br />
And Yrel? Blackhand basically killed Maraad, and he was acting under Grom's orders. The &quot;great man&quot; in your speech is dead because of the guy you're standing next to. Are you just going to let him go?!<br />
<br />
Surprised we're done so quickly; hopefully we'll hear about 7.0 sooner than later?<br />
<br />
Oh well, at least Gul'dan isn't dead, and we have a Durotan and Grom to look forward to seeing in future expansions. And Yrel. I like Yrel, just question her decisions in this cinematic... Eh, maybe it was a &quot;heat of the moment&quot; thing.</div></div><hr />

They easily could have Grommash get inadvertently corrupted as the Legion finds a way back. I dunno. Just spitballing. I doubt they would say Grommash was the last boss then suddenly just end it like this.<br />

Blizzard said Illidan would return in MoP, and he didn't.</div></div><hr />

My, bad, though. I said, &quot;Garrosh,&quot; not &quot;Grommash,&quot; and I meant &quot;Grommash.&quot; Chris Metzen said, &quot;Grom Hellscream,&quot; back in BlizzCon 2014.</div></div><hr />

They said it was not the last patch of this expansion. There easily could be another raid as well- ala Ruby Sanctum. The new story will be unfolding in the next patch(es)- which they stated would be the case.<br />
<br />
Look for at least one more, but most likely 3 new hardcore dungeons in the next patch.<br />
<br />
So Archimonde did a soul transfer and fled back to the nether in his new orc body, while Gul'dan dies in Archimonde body. Great more Orc bad guys next expansion. This is a cop out. Grommash should have been killed also as well as Gul'dan.<br />
<br />
Are you just complaining to be complaining? There is zero indication the next expansion will be Orc heavy. Stating that any orc in any new expansion is somehow a cop out is childish.<br />
<br />
Please explain just why Grommash &quot;should&quot; have died? Good God.<br />
<br />
The amount of just chronic, kneejerk insults that so many on THIS website partake in makes this site now feel like a commune for hopelessly codependent Romper Room adults.<br />
<br />
Headache inducing.<br />

You gotta love people who have zero art talent who love to call other's art work cheap.<br />

Good riddance with this site.</div></div><hr />
