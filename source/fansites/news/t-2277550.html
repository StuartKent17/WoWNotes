Argus should be on the full cosmic map, not the broken isles, this is just lazy.<br />
<br />
Easier to track emissaries this way. Imagine having to click back and forth to see where all your emissary quests are. It'd be a nightmare. <br />
<br />
Also, Argus is just a content patch, not an entire expansion, so it makes even more sense to have it on the Broken Isles map.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I like the change...<br />
Still too I wonder on how the planet will be affected by this too, and hopefully after Argus we will get 7.4 with the finishing up Legion stuff and then lead into the pre-patch stuff for the next expansion. <br />
Hopefully it will be South Seas/Najatar since we never seen Queen Azshara or her Nazjatar Empire at all since Azsuna.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not &quot;lazy&quot;<br />
<br />
It's not like it would take them significantly more time to add it somewhere else. If anything, it'd be easier because they've done that before, where as this way of displaying it is a new idea.<br />
<br />
This is obviously an intentional design decision because they think it's better this way. I kind of agree with them, I think it's better for ease of use to keep the expansion's zone on the one map - it'd be a massive pain in the ass to have to zoom all the way out to cosmic view and zoom back in to Argus if I want to have a look at what WQs are up while I'm elsewhere in Broken Isles.<br />
<br />
You can disagree and say you think the &quot;epicness&quot; of having a separate world map is worth the hit to QoL but it's clearly not done this way to be &quot;lazy&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
lmao how is it lazy? Are you suggesting it somehow would take more work for them to *just put it in a different place*...<br />
Is the other map somehow more difficult for them to access? <br />
<br />
No, it isnt lazy, its done from a UIX perspective. You want to access the maps that are relevant to you all in one place. Having to back out twice and then click the map you need every time you wanted to check your Argus world quests would be fucking tiring. <br />
<br />
This was done because *you're lazy* not because the devs are somehow lazy.</div></div><hr />

Put it in the already existing circle on the bottom right. Recolor the already existing circle to look more fel.<br />
<br />
It really will always look kinda lazy as is with the design choices (Chaotic Design to match the design of the planet itself) but they can make it look better than it is.</div></div><hr />

That isn't lazy, yep.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point is more that the circle at the bottom is already in existence. A less cluttered more shaped map is a better map. Imagine if the universe map just had outland floating instead of in a circle. It looks dumb without a uniform shape.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK but what you said doesn't make it less lazy.<br />
I don't think their design is lazy at all, and your idea is just to use another corner.</div></div><hr />

Seems pretty lazy (either way) to just slap argus on a map in a random spot and put some green around it.</div></div><hr />

Yup. also, its located in a weird spot tbh. doesn't make alot of sense to be in that corner</div></div><hr />

Agreed. They obviously just wanted to put all Legion content together for whatever reason, but I find it sort of unsightly. If at least we had to take a portal from BI, it would already make more sense - but that's not even the case.</div></div><hr />

To make checking Argus out easier? I mean, it's not like Outland, or Draenor, where they have over 8-9 zones. This place has 3 zones, and it won't fit the map. I don't expect a cosmic map re-haul in a patch of all things.<br />

Who cares about what corner it's at? It's a map update.</div></div><hr />
