Tanking Damage Adjustment Hot Fixes<br />
We’ve recently implemented several hot fixes to adjust tank damage output, particularly area of effect (AoE) damage. Now that Mogu’Shan Vaults is available, and the first week of Mists of Pandaria raiding is about to begin, we wanted to call out what’s changing.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E))<br />
Warriors have several mechanics that improve their tanking performance when dealing with multiple foes, as well as their damage output against them. Their damage against packs of creatures, especially when three targets were present, was much higher than other tanking classes. While some variance is expected, it was clear that an adjustment was necessary. <br />
The primary culprits here were Revenge and Deep Wounds:<br />
<br />
Revenge (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/6572) now deals 50% damage to a secondary target, and 25% damage to a third target. Deep Wounds (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/115768) now does 50% less damage for Protection Warriors only.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
One of our goals with our active mitigation tanking model is that you have opportunities to trade significant survivability for more damage when maximum survivability isn’t required. For example, a Warrior could opt to use their rage for Heroic Strike instead of Shield Block or Shield Barrier. This damage gain is intended to be relatively small, and not worth the loss in survivability when actively tanking. <br />
<br />
However, for Protection Paladins, this trade-off was much too lucrative. For maximum survivability, Protection Paladins are intended to use Seal of Insight, since it provides a buff to their self-healing, and also provides a significant self-heal on their melee in combination with Vengeance. Unfortunately, when using Seal of Insight, their damage was too low compared to the other tanks. When using Seal of Truth, their damage was too high. So, we’ve increased Protection Paladin damage in general to compensate for Seal of Insight’s relatively low output, while simultaneously reducing the damage of Seal of Truth to bring it into line. <br />
<br />
Holy Wrath (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/119072) now deals 100% more damage. Avenger's Shield (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/31935) now deals 50% more damage. Seal of Truth (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/31801) and Censure (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/31803) now deal 80% less damage for Protection Paladins only.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s))<br />
Bear tanks have been in a decent place, but we were a little concerned about their sustained area of effect damage. This update to Thrash should address that.<br />
<br />
The periodic damage of Thrash (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/106832) (Bear) now deals 60% more damage. Initial direct damage remains un-changed.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
We’re really excited about how Brewmaster Monks are turning out. They can still stand a few tweaks though. Their damage, especially AoE damage, was relatively low, and they lacked a way to apply Weakened Blows to a large pack of creatures (which all of the other tanks have).<br />
<br />
Keg Smash (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121253) now deals 50% more damage and strikes all nearby targets, rather than three. Swift Reflexes (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/124334) now deals 100% more damage.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
While Blood Death Knights have been higher on damage than most other tanks, we’re expecting that the adjustments we’re making to the other tanking classes will close the gap. While we haven’t made any changes to Blood lately, we will be keeping a close eye on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.0.5 Hotfixes - October 2<br />
General<br />
<br />
Players no longer require Honored reputation with Mists of Pandaria factions to purchase gear with Justice Points.<br />
The reputation requirement to purchase certain pieces of Mists of Pandaria Valor Point gear have been reduced from Revered to Honored. These include:<br />
<br />
Klaxxi - neck items (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=396&amp;filter-expansion=5&amp;filter-quality=16&amp;filter-slot=4)<br />
Golden Lotus - rings (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=396&amp;filter-expansion=5&amp;filter-quality=16&amp;filter-slot=2048)<br />
Shado-Pan - cloaks (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=396&amp;filter-expansion=5&amp;filter-quality=16&amp;filter-slot=65536)<br />
August Celestials - bracers (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-sold-currency=396&amp;filter-expansion=5&amp;filter-quality=16&amp;filter-slot=512)<br />
<br />
<br />
The item level of Mists of Pandaria gear that is purchased with Justice Points has been raised from 450 to 458.<br />
The item level of Mists of Pandaria gear that is purchased with Honor Points has been lowered from 464 to 458. As a result, the quality color of these items has been changed from Epic to Rare. However, the PvP Power and PvP resilience of these items has been increased significantly so these items retain their previous degree of effectiveness in PvP.<br />
Mists of Pandaria PvP item vendors were tired of getting the dook kicked out of them. Their health has been increased significantly.<br />
The item level requirement to queue for Mists of Pandaria Heroic dungeons has been reduced from 440 to 435.<br />
<br />

nice Monk changes, although the Keg Smash changes were already applied, I'm guessin this is just a tooltip update, as the tooltip is showing the old values.<br />
<br />
Swift Reflexes change is.... interesting, tbh the damage was fine already, if you want to buff it get rid of the 1sec ICD :P, but hey I'll never complain about buff :S<br />
<br />
also.. TOTALY saw the Censure change coming :P holy bejesus it was dealing redonkulous damage, nice they balanced it with buffs to AS and HW, HW in particular was dealing pretty godawful damage..<br />

also.... did I miss the memo we're supposed to tank in Insight? I've always used Truth for ST and SoR for AoE :S</div></div><hr />

Prot pally damage was way to low, but Seal of Truth was doing too much damage, so nerf seal and buff 2 abilites. I'm very skeptical these changes will fix anything since they said seal damage was too high...not sure if they even play the game.</div></div><hr />

Well the change to Peace Pipe was crappy crap crap, why? because A LOT of guilds just farmed them at lvl 85 in groups, and also made lowlvl toons on lowpop servers to use the CRZ to farm them even faster and got Exalted really fast on all factions, how was there any risk for them? it was changed to give 100 rep on the 2nd, and again today it was changed it seems.</div></div><hr />

True :) I just dislike normal/hardmode alot, When I kill a boss hes dead to me so when we do hardmodes I just have no motivation on killing them :( .<br />
Rather spend alot of time on a boss than kill him on 1 day and try him or just flat out end skipping him until better geared.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is some minor things I'd love to see done for that spec, but the more geared I have been getting, specially getting good weapons, the way better damage is. When I first started doing a lot of the killing dailies, while I could do, it took 10-15 seconds per mob (or longer on elites/bosses) and I felt I had downtime sometimes waiting on health to recoup from said fights.<br />
<br />
Now I'm in mostly all 5man heroic, have good weapons, even the epic boots from that Sha quest turn in, and I'm cutting through the same mobs like hot knife through butter. I went from being about the same damage (30-35k on average) on single target fights to upwards of 50-55k, and for AOE fights I can easily top 100-120k.<br />
<br />
My main hand weapon isn't my BiS 5man Heroic either, but it is a 463 and my offhand is a 450... Still trying to get my BiS's to drop from Scarlet Halls, but that's RNG for you. - http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/norgannon/Corpser/simple</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you shouldn't try and cheat the system by transferring servers then hmmm? Blizzard enjoys you spending your money on transfers, though.</div></div><hr />

Yea this is my link http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/lightnings-blade/Ithunkhard/simple and I agree with all of what you said really. I would still want to see some addition where Assassination dps maybe gets buffed 5% or so but mainly just want them to reduce the amount of time I'm just standing there. Seriously feels like 35 to 50% of the time, I'm just sitting there waiting (simcraft agrees) and it's so boring. It's dps is decent enough though that I can't really complain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More would have cleared it. Many other hardcore guilds said they are using the lockout to iron out their strategies for hard modes and did not care about world first achievements on the normal bosses.</div></div><hr />

Just another &quot;Blizzard deciding how you have to play&quot; gig.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By default I always use seal of truth esspecially for raid encounters. however if I've got plenty of threat and the healers are struggling due to a heavy period of damage I have used SOI for the extra self heals BUT if you use that crap on the pull you WILL loose agro. I tried it last night and yea I loose significant threat vs the other two seals. I'll give Blizzard this though the self healing from it has been buffed massively seeing upto 25 to 20k heals per melee swing.<br />
<br />
I'd love to be able to use SOI all the time but the threat drop is just to high to justify it.</div></div><hr />
