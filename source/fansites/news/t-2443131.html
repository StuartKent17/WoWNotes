MDI All Stars at BlizzCon: A Viewer’s Guide<br />
We’ve loved everyone’s enthusiasm around the World of Warcraft Mythic Dungeon Invitational (MDI) series, where some of the most skilled PvE teams from around the world race to complete Mythic+ Dungeons in the fastest, most efficient way possible.<br />
<br />
At BlizzCon 2018, we want to bring you the most epic dungeon races yet with MDI All Stars. We’ve invited exceL's Angels, Method NA, Method PogChamp, and Free Marsy to show us what they’ve got in the dungeons of Kul Tiras and Zandalar. They’ll be racing live and in-person, on stage at BlizzCon, fighting for the bragging rights of being the first Battle for Azeroth MDI champions.<br />
<br />
What You Need to Know<br />
<br />
Format: Best-of-three, single elimination. Finals also will be a best of three.<br />
<br />
Dungeons: This is the first Mythic Dungeon Invitational taking place in the Battle for Azeroth, and we want to celebrate it properly. We want to see some of the best guilds in the world play on as many BfA dungeons as possible, so we have preset the pool for each match. Keystones will be Level 13—difficult for sure, but nothing that these pros can’t handle! The pool is as follows:<br />
<br />
exceL's Angels vs Free Marsy - The Underrot, Atal'Dazar, Tol Dagor<br />
Method NA vs Method PogChamp - Temple of Sethraliss, Freehold, Kings' Rest<br />
Winner 1 vs Winner 2 - THE MOTHERLODE!!, Shrine of the Storm, Waycrest Manor<br />
<br />
Affixes: Dungeons for MDI All Stars will have four affixes preselected. Since we’re in Season 1 for BfA, all dungeons will be using the seasonal affix Infested, which applies the Symbiote of G’huun on certain mobs. This causes other mobs within eight yards to heal for 10% of their max health every three seconds. Once the infested mob is killed, two Spawns of G’huun will run towards the closest non-boss mobs and infest them unless they’re quickly controlled and killed. Sneaky little symbiotes.<br />
<br />
But that’s not all! Here’s a list of each dungeon and their four preselected affixes:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Underrot - Fortified, Sanguine, Grievous, Infested<br />
Atal'Dazar - Tyrannical, Teeming, Volcanic, Infested<br />
Tol Dagor - Fortified, Bursting, Skittish, Infested<br />
Temple of Sethraliss - Fortified, Bolstering, Explosive, Infested<br />
Freehold - Tyrannical, Bolstering, Skittish, Infested<br />
Kings' Rest - Tyrannical, Bursting, Quaking, Infested<br />
The MOTHERLODE!! - Tyrannical, Raging, Necrotic, Infested<br />
Shrine of the Storm - Fortified, Sanguine, Grievous, Infested<br />
Waycrest Manor - Tyrannical, Sanguine, Explosive, Infested<br />
<br />
<br />
Schedule<br />
<br />
Saturday, November 3 at 9:30 a.m. PDT (17:30 CET)<br />
<br />
The MDI All Stars will kick off first thing in the morning on the second day of BlizzCon with ExceL's Angels versus Free Marsy. This will be followed by Method NA versus Method PogChamp, which will lead into the finals. It’s a day of back-to-back dungeon-racing goodness!<br />

/Inspect the All Stars on Twitch<br />
Earlier this year, in the Arena World Championship, we introduced our new Twitch extension /Inspect. Using this tool, you can inspect your favorite players in real time, just like you would in the game itself. We are excited to bring this extension to BlizzCon not just for the AWC, but for MDI All Stars as well. Tune in to learn some creative Mythic strategies, follow the players who inspire you, and dive into those tooltips to see what gear the best are running with.<br />
<br />
BlizzCon is stacked with WoW esports this year, and we’re excited to be able to bring you a set of exhibition matches to celebrate the creativity and skill of these Mythic teams in our most recent BfA dungeons. Be sure to follow us on Twitch, and follow us on Twitter for all things World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

Exactly my thoughts. They apparently looked at their statistics, thought to themselves &quot;hm, I guess no one in their right mind is doing Island Expeditions&quot; and then came up with THIS solution as an incentive.<br />
<br />
Why, yes, Blizzard, why would I NOT grind Expeditions for several hours each day so I can get myself +250 reputation!<br />
<br />
After all, what would have been the alternative to get that much rep? Do 10 world quests in 30 minutes? Preposterous.<br />
<br />
And are doubloons even account-wide? Because the rep tokens sure are not.</div></div><hr />

yea they are a lot faster than normal swimming although there is a lot of nicer underwater mounts that are pretty easy obtainable so meh</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
100 dubloons for 250 rep, are you fucking kidding me? They're THAT out of touch.<br />
<br />
So what do you think would be a fair number? Personally, I don't think 250 is unreasonable at all. I'm guessing that there are quite a few people sitting on a few thousand doubloons just from farming toys and mounts and transmogs and all the fun things that has become modern WoW. With that in mind, 250 seems like a pretty good number to me.</div></div><hr />

The best part is how they actually had all these systems perfectly working in Legion where you had different badges to trade for gear. They even fixed legendaries at latest patches with essence dropping from emissary caches, dungeons and raids.<br />

You need literally 10-15 minutes to get 250 reputation by simply running some world quests on a fresh character going solo. It's even faster with a better geared one or in a group. If you are lucky, you get about 10 dubloons in that time from expeditions. This is hilariously out of touch.

Like in many expansion they add catch-up gear etc later in the expansion. This isn't new. Relinquished came in 7.2, 8-9 months after Legion launch. In TBC it came in the Black Temple patch, 2.1. In WoD it came, never? WotLK and Cata it came from start, then they started to lose subs. Gotta keep those players playing ;)<br />
<br />
Legendaries was good from 7.2, it was fine from 7.1.5. <br />
<br />
They want people to actually play the game in the start before they add these things now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me make sure I have this clear. A fresh 120 can get 250 reputation every 15 minutes just on world quests, which gets easier as you progress item level. On top of that you get a bunch of reputation from emissaries, other non-world quests, and if I'm not mistaken, dungeons. But 250 reputation for doubloons is &quot;out of touch&quot;. I think I got it. Still not changing my stance. 250 is perfectly reasonable.</div></div><hr />

Granted, once I have exalted with each group on a character of each faction I won't need to worry about rep on alts for the most part (also considering catch-up mechanics will be in-game by the time I level the rest of my characters, so rep rewards will be irrelevant).<br />
<br />
As for the rewards from it, I feel like it's too little too late. IE's already have a bad reputation. They need to make ALL rewards buyable with dubloons (of varying costs) in order for them to viable to be run. Also, consider selling gear tokens for Dubloons - maybe pirate themed ones.</div></div><hr />

Agree, but I'd be willing to accept moving all the gear sets to Trial of Style, putting all the weapons on a Doubloon vendor and giving us a way to guarantee at least one special drop when we run Islands based off a Doubloon purchase.</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't like or enjoy doing world quest they are kind of boring for me I prefer practicing dungeons over and over while gaining something out of them which could be useful whether might be gear or rep from it. This is really the only way I'll see myself gaining revered or exalted with different rep. I haven't even finished the War Campaign since it requires 7th Legion rep revered. And the only reason I pushed that rep a bit was so I could run King's Rest dungeon.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. It's going to take, what, 25-40+ island expeditions to get 100 tokens? For 250 reputation?<br />
And for 500 tokens you get a mount? Or was it 400? I already forgot. <br />
500 tokens for a mount sounds reasonable. 100 tokens for 250 rep sounds very off.<br />
Maybe 10 tokens for 250 rep, that'd be way more reasonable.<br />
<br />
Two or three world quests would net you more rep. The scaling of that seems very off.</div></div><hr />

Huh, I didn't see it. I'm not fishin' for it. Ah well.<br />

<br />
I pretty much pointed out that reputation is just too easy to get in so many other ways that this really isn't as much of an issue as some are making it out to be. I imagine most people will use their doubloons to buy mounts and toys and such more than they will to buy rep tokens. I could be wrong.

<br />
Let's look at this another way. For most people it'll take about a month to get 100 tokens. 1 month for 250 rep, even if it's BoA, is still way too small.<br />
Even if it's HALF of that, let's say two weeks -- for 250 rep. Too small.<br />
<br />
Now it's possible they plan on upping the amount or offering other ways of farming them.<br />
<br />
It seems ridiculous to put them in there in the first place.<br />
<br />
Compare it to time walking reputation, for instance, and you'll see how it's wildly out of scale relative to other content.<br />
<br />
Something is missing here as I doubt they'd do this on purpose like this.</div></div><hr />
