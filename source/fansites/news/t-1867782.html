You only get one code, which is the one you use to register for the stream. All the goodies are linked to that one.</div></div><hr />

Last year Prio access was given to the lotv beta and not for a while have people who have been there been given beta codes for stuff like WoW. The WoD one was Pax South if I'm not mistaken.</div></div><hr />

Don't buy it then and watch the free stream of the opening ceremony and tournaments.</div></div><hr />

The hots mount is a bit underwhelming I admit but I play sc2, hearthstone and D3 a lot and these are the usual yearly rewards. Murloc portrait looks cool.</div></div><hr />

You usually get the stuff shortly before or during Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

I somewhat like the HS cards and the D3 banner. But that murloc portrait is rendered straight from 1995 or something.</div></div><hr />

To be fair its kinda hard to make stuff like portraits in Diablo have a bit of super wham. Granted its not as awesome as some of the season ones. As for banners they ruin my Kerrigan Wings :(</div></div><hr />

1- Legion info, beta builds, general wow news/tweets etc and 2- Its primarily a WoW fansite it does occasionally post non wow info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then pay $199 for an actual ticket and go Blizzcon. These are for people who cannot attend and people who buy a virtual ticket can actually purchase 1 goody bag if I read correctly. Also people who play Starcraft and Diablo will obviously care so your statement is invalid.</div></div><hr />

So it's a shameless cash grab, thought I was pretty clear about that. If I'm watching, it will be via a free stream, plenty of those around usually.</div></div><hr />

Well yeah the opening ceremony and tournament streams are free. As for those illegal ones they generally get taken down pretty quick.</div></div><hr />

Up to you if you feel the goodies and 2 day stream are worth that value then ofc you buy it but if not then don't. Your decision at the end of the day.</div></div><hr />

Debatable to whether the consumer feels he/she will enjoy or get their £24.99s worth out of it (uk here) Obviously you feel you won't but others may feel differently.</div></div><hr />

Season 3 banner looks ok with Kerrigan Wings imo.<br />
As for the portrait, keep in mind it's enlarged in the picture so the quality looks a bit worse.</div></div><hr />

I dont understand what your trying to say<br />
A pet is still a cool reward<br />
<br />
Also blizzard has more games now so you actually get more stuff as well compared to before<br />
I find the rewards kinda disappointing as well<br />
<br />
Pet is nice <br />
Cardback looks pretty cool<br />
Mount is cool but not as cool as the horse<br />
Portaits look bad<br />
The diablo pet atleast looks nice</div></div><hr />

How many you got bro? over 500? cool, lets pet battle with 3 buttons and skip raids &amp; rbgs tonight!<br />
<br />
You mean the one time you got a bear and the one time you got a Murlock costume and those were the only things you got at all. Is that the time you are referring too? Those two times. All two of them? When you had to actually go to blizzcon to get them and not just sit on your ass at home for 40 bucks? Just wanted to check because you seem act like it happened multiple times and not just twice....on two separate occurrences. Because before that it was also pets when pets did nothing but run next two you and one was a reskin of pink and blue. They could just give us nothing and you could read the news on the front page.<br />
<br />
I mean its almost like they give us more stuff than ever now. But hey complain more.</div></div><hr />

You don't get a code. You have to purchase the ticket being logged into your bnet account, so it's just tied to that upon purchase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol I'm sure blizz throws their marketing budget at it out of the goodness of their hearts.<br />
<br />
Blizz 'loses money' on Blizzcon only if we inhabit a universe where their sole business is conventions.<br />
<br />
It isnt. It's selling you games. Lol &quot;not for profit &quot;</div></div><hr />

I hope your otter appreciates the murloc, they should get along well ;)<br />
<br />
Not really feeling it with these rewards. I like Murkidan, but will wait for the schedule to appear before I actually buy the ticket.</div></div><hr />

Theres a difference between white knighting and defending I suggest you learn these differences. If people can blindly attack something you enjoy then what is wrong with defending it? Also Protoss for life :)</div></div><hr />

Its a shame no one can just give a flat out honest critique of what they think is wrong with the game without some defender of the holy grail attacking you. Once you go mount (hotness or a 10) back down to a pet (whack 1-2) am I really suppose to be excited about that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because at the end of the day people would probably care more about the convention itself over pixels. And that rating is purely opinion. The mount and costume are quite rare now anyways less than 10,000 of each if I'm not mistaken so. They could give out 0 rewards for attending/watching the convention and people would still watch at the end of the day the goodies are because they chose to not because they have to. Also at the end of the day you are entitled to your opinions just know others don't have to share/agree with said opinion.</div></div><hr />

Speak for yourself. I'd much, much rather have a pet than a mount. Mounts are great and I collect them but they aren't nearly as interesting as a pet with a potential new move set that could shake up the meta (not saying Murkidan will have that necessarily). Murkalot was and still is amazing.</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about? The pet has always been the signature thing at blizzcon...they gave a mount and costume each only once. Meanwhile, there have been 6 murloc pets given out. Also, what was that &quot;about your character&quot; part? In what way does another mount or costume benefit your character more than a pet? All 3 are completely cosmetic.<br />
<br />
2004: Murky (pet)<br />
2007: Murloc Costume (costume)<br />
2008: Polar bear (mount)<br />
2009: Grunty (pet)<br />
2010: Deathy (pet)<br />
2011: Murkablo (pet)<br />
2013: Murkalot (pet)<br />
2014: Grommloc (pet)<br />
<br />
The WoW item for the past 5 Blizzcons has been a murloc pet and the reward from the first Blizzcon was also a murloc pet. If I went to Blizzcon, I would be expecting that I get a murloc pet.</div></div><hr />

Tbh if I ever go I would just hope for an enjoyable show. Ofc goodies are nice but I think Blizzcon is more about the show than goodies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Completely agree, the show and environment is definitely the best part (never been to blizzcon but have been to Comic Con and it was amazing). Just pointing out to the people who are disappointed that the goody isn't a mount that the general theme of blizzcon goodies is for it to be a pet and to not expect a mount just because it happened once.</div></div><hr />

Problem for me is I live in the UK so travel and other personal reasons stop me from going. But every year since 2010 me and my friends have got a Virtual Ticket and set up our pc to a huge ass TV! :). I'll admit 2014 was a bit meh and I was expecting them to showcase something for Warcraft's 20th anniversary but I watch Blizzcon more for Starcraft and Diablo personally. As for goodies nice to have em but at the end of the day they do it for the fans not because they have to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first Blizzcon was 2005. <br />
<br />
I think an important thing to remember as well is that not only did we only get one digital good for most years, not only was it ONLY available for live attendees, but there are 500% more games being supported with digital gifts. Maybe you don't play those, but a lot of us (especially the people who ATTEND blizzcon) do. We get a nice variety of gifts across all the games, including a mount for heroes of the storm, which is probably the best place for a mount to be given. You use it every single game, no bullshit about flying, it can be as crazy off the wall as they want. <br />
<br />
A wow mount has too many restrictions; new players cant use it, does it fly, does it not fly, whats the theme, plus how could they EVER top the bear with a murloc mount? I've been using it for almost 9 years now. Its my favorite item in game. <br />
<br />
I can understand that pet, pet, pet, pet might get a little stale after awhile if you only play wow but a murloc pet is practically tradition at this point (even the mount had one). I'd be more disappointed if we didn't get one at this point, though I use that word very, very loosely because I go to Blizzcon to enjoy the show, feel the vibe, and tell all the developers and actors how much i like their work. The pets and banners are just gravy.</div></div><hr />

These are for people who cannot attend and people who buy a virtual ticket can actually purchase 1 goody bag if I read correctly. Also people who play Starcraft and Diablo will obviously care so your statement is invalid.<br />
<br />
Only reason I bought the VT is for the requirement to the IRL goodie bag. It will make a cute new purse to add to my collection...though Murkadin is just an added bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was announced even later than usual last year, like 3 weeks before. worth it, though. Metallica put on one of the better Blizzcon shows, especially compared to Blink. Foo Fighters is still the best though. Can't even imagine who they are going to get this year though i'm hoping for a total 180 and they get Weird Al. He has a suspicious gap in the Mandatory Fun schedule that would be perfect for Blizzcon :)</div></div><hr />

Tbh it is very unlikely here but I'm hoping they get AC/DC :O. Like I said unlikely but hey one can wish :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My only hesitation with that would be Ozzy. He tried for sure, and a few songs were great, but I don't think the crowd was prepared to give him what he was used to getting from an audience and any time he strayed from the huge hits like Paranoid, Crazy Train, etc (ie: the shit you hear in rock band/guitar hero) the energy died way down.<br />
<br />
I think people would be super pumped any time they played a song that was in Iron Man and kind of bobbing and nodding for others. It's maybe teh biggest issue with the Blizzcon concerts. Yes, we are all there to celebrate a shared interest but boy does that not translate into musical tastes, except for when we had video games live maybe. The Dun Murough tavern theme doesn't exactly inspire a ton of crowd energy though.<br />
<br />
Foo Fighters felt like the best with the crowd but we were also like 20 ft from stage and it was amazing. No idea what it was like back by the bathrooms.</div></div><hr />

You realise all Activision Blizzard is for is a holding company yes and that neither have any say in what happens with their games?. Eg Blizzard can't go to Activision and tell them what to do with Call of Duty just as Activision cannot tell Blizzard what to do with World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />
