Sure but why does faction balance need matter. As an alliance only player I would rather have a movie spend 70% of its time on the horde and be good than bend over backwards to make a mediocre film with equality. To get something to 50/50 you have to be spending effort to get it there. Just make a good movie who gives a shit about balance.</div></div><hr />

It is true, they've said it several times. Mostly because translating through <br />

Whatever, look at Letters from Iwo Jima and Flags of our Fathers. Many War movies today are looking at both sides not being 2 dimensional bad guys vs good guys. There will be plenty of zealous evil orcs and there will be orcs who feel conflicted about what they are doing and it will feel like an actual movie people won't dismiss as &quot;just another video game/fantasy movie&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's about time someone took the genre seriously other than Peter Jackson who can also present a realistic depiction of drama and morality. <br />
<br />
This isn't just a fucking action movie.</div></div><hr />

It kinda goes without saying. They have to have a degree of flexibility when condensing that much lore into a 2 hour film. There will be differences to the story of the games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's plenty of fantasy films where the enemy is a faceless evil horde. Any film about Warcraft has to address the perspectives of both sides of the conflict, to show the motivations of the orcs and why they are warring against the humans. That is what separates Warcraft from other fantasy stories. To do this effectively, the story will have to be told from both sides, which is completely doable and I'm confident in Duncan Jones to be able to pull it off.</div></div><hr />

Don't take 50/50 so fucking literally. They mean they want to show ethical dilemma on both sides, but mostly the fact the orc culture was being taken over like Nazi Germany. <br />
<br />
How many amazing WW2 movies have we gotten now that show the struggles between politicians and the military in Germany during WW2?<br />
This is no different. Not every orc wanted to be a demonic mutant. Many welcomed it. This makes it more interesting than &quot;Watch the pretty humans in shining armor kill monsters for 3 hours&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I understand that, but going entirely different continuity is retarded. If we see things like Durotan wielding Doomhammer, that'd be horrible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ravenmoon</div><div class="date">2014-11-07, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, I sorta fear this focus on both &quot;Horde&quot; and Alliance might ruin the movie. They could have made something perfectly amazing just using the Alliance PoV -- and this is coming from a primarily Horde player. <br />
<br />
Durotan doesn't even do anything during the First War. I'm guessing the movie is going to retcon a lot of shit just so he can be important.<br />
<br />
no they couldn't, they have been battling for years to make horde and alliance viewed equally because world of warcraft gameplay entirely hinges on an equal balance.<br />
<br />
WoW has been strongly horde driven because it needs to equal factions, and the alliance had all the trump cards from all the strategy games, because in the strategy games you never had to choose a faction, you always played both.<br />
<br />
so when the mmorpg hit, and you could choose, naturally most people went alliance, and that really messed up the system and what they wanted to achieve, making world pvp frustrating, it was partially what motivated battlegrounds - a controlld environment to pvp, that could even things up a bit, and obviously detract from excessive grieving on pvp realms. but it didn't do much until they designed the intelligent queuing system.. and that has helped and lead to cross bs, arenas, cross everything.<br />
<br />
and still they are trying to even them out, they feel the story is the biggest motivator to play horde. and I think they have consequently lost sight, the franchise is too balance oreitntated, which makes for sucky stories, or a terrible restraint .. saying that you can still right a touching story. The whole movie is about boosting the game rather than creating a new dawn for the franchise.<br />
<br />
such a shame. <br />
<br />
the way forward should have been, the movie, and build the game around. especially when oyu release a movie 10 years into t your mmo, you should be planning a new wow mmo based around the movie. Why limit to 2 factions? why not try a few things differently etc, warcraft 1-3 were written really well, however the real genius came in WC3 often remarked as climax of warcraft story telling. WoW sucks at telling a story, TBC, WotLK, Cata, MoP,. - cata could have been a great story, but not much you can do in a wow style mmo format to tell that story, you needed to build a game like SWTOR, with their style of conversations etc, but rather than have different stories for every class or race, you just do it per faction with slight emphasis based on race or class.<br />
<br />
That's my opinion so far. Saying that, I see no reason why it can't be 50/50, it could be a better story, what I wonder is how much will be changed in the story, and ultimately, would be much better.. beause the emphasis might change in many ways once the details are in. The game is more a summary than an actual film or a book, now you have people doing the details, I wonder how it would present itself</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">theturn</div><div class="date">2014-11-07, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's plenty of fantasy films where the enemy is a faceless evil horde. Any film about Warcraft has to address the perspectives of both sides of the conflict, to show the motivations of the orcs and why they are warring against the humans. That is what separates Warcraft from other fantasy stories. To do this effectively, the story will have to be told from both sides, which is completely doable and I'm confident in Duncan Jones to be able to pull it off.<br />
<br />
And you can do that without the need to make in 50/50. Most movies and tv shows don't balance out evil and good by 50/50. They develop characters however long that takes. Let that process be natural and don't worry if you end up spending more time with one side than the other.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeluron Lightsong</div><div class="date">2014-11-07, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't take 50/50 so fucking literally. They mean they want to show ethical dilemma on both sides, but mostly the fact the orc culture was being taken over like Nazi Germany. <br />
<br />
How many amazing WW2 movies have we gotten now that show the struggles between politicians and the military in Germany during WW2?<br />
This is no different. Not every orc wanted to be a demonic mutant. Many welcomed it. This makes it more interesting than &quot;Watch the pretty humans in shining armor kill monsters for 3 hours&quot;.<br />
<br />
Which is a oversimplification at best. Anyone with a reasonable sense of mind can see what Warcraft really is. It isn't hard to see.</div></div><hr />

Oh is it?? Is it going to be laughably bad?? How exactly did you reach this conclusion?

It shouldn't have any sigil (just the circle, nothing inside it), Thrall put the wolf on sometime after taking the hammer. I expect they've changed it just to make it more obvious to non-players - &quot;hey that's Thralls hammer!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Why should they? They never played a part in WC 1... And so didn't the Trolls, Gnomes or Dwarfs. The First War is only about the sacking of Stormwind. Maybe you can see some elves in the background. But there simply wasn't any elf playing a mayor rule.</div></div><hr />

Not every orc does, but most of them. They talked about Durotan being this upright standing/walking all seeing orc and Orgrim (interpreted by Rob Kazinsky) this more rough and less smart peon like orc.</div></div><hr />

They were going to make this movie in 2006 around the peak of WOW's word of mouth popularity before it kept swelling until 2011ish. <br />
They chose to wait until they felt they had an actual story to tell rather than CASH IN on a video game, unlike every video game movie that has ever existed. <br />

They'll be showing off Dalaran if I recall correctly, though. Surely they could fit a few high elves in there? Especially when elves are the second most popular race in the game itself.</div></div><hr />

I found the panel to be reassuring that its in good hands. Put it in the hands of fans of the franchise, almost ensures it won't suck.<br />
<br />

<br />
It's completely subjective. Did you expect it to be an academy award winning film the moment it was announced? Or do you always join threads about the Warcraft movie just to bash it because &quot;movies based on video games always suck&quot;. Makes a ton of sense. <br />
<br />
&quot;But they don't matter&quot;. No, what doesn't matter is if the movie grosses high or not. If the fans love it, then it was a success, regardless of how it does at the box office. Maybe they won't be able to do sequels if it doesn't do well but it'll still be a success in the eyes of the people that actually do matter. And with the popularity of the Warcraft universe, box office success for the first film is almost guaranteed.</div></div><hr />

Blizzcon is also not really the best place to release the first movie trailer.<br />
I mean only the gamers watch this the movie needs to get the public (non gamers) to the cinematic.<br />
<br />
If they want to build hype they should release the 1e trailer at the Super Bowl. Alot more ppl watch those trailers.</div></div><hr />

But they have enough footage to show it on repeat in their Cinematics theater. Instead of telling everyone at the panel to &quot;go upstairs and watch it!&quot; Why couldn't they just show it during the panel?</div></div><hr />

I completely disagree. There is no good side and bad side in warcraft, there's only opinions. I personally prefer the horde, but I know that doesn't make them the good side and the alliance the bad side. Each side has their own story to tell and that's what will make this movie interesting. I'm excited for it and I'm glad they moved away from making it alliance dominant. Initially they were going to do a 60% alliance 40% horde, glad it's not split evenly.</div></div><hr />

Chris Metzen said during the panel that he already saw the whole movie (albeit a really rough copy). I'm sure they could have thrown some footage together to show us.</div></div><hr />

I mean only the gamers watch this the movie needs to get the public (non gamers) to the cinematic.<br />
<br />
If they want to build hype they should release the 1e trailer at the Super Bowl. Alot more ppl watch those trailers.<br />
<br />
I hope so! Super Bowl trailers are usually awesome!</div></div><hr />

*shrug* it probably costs a lot, too, and as they have no real reason to market it more than a year before it comes out, they probably figured there was no point?</div></div><hr />

Should be amusing to see this with my WoW playing friends, they consider the Alliance to be the baddies. I consider the horde to be the baddies, haha.<br />

Yes, however - it still means the virtual ticket isn't worth the paper it's sold on, if you don't get to see everything the live audience does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly why I clicked on this thread, to find someone who recorded it on the live stream. Why would you not want to promote the movie to your fan base? Californians get all the goodstuff; bring a convention to the East Coast or let us view the promo, jerks.</div></div><hr />
