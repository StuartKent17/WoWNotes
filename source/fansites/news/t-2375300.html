Nah. I have a buddy who's 2/11 LFR &quot;raider&quot; and a tmog hunter, he got an invite &gt;_&gt; But streamers are the majority of those who received the first wave of invites, as always.</div></div><hr />

Hardly matters, every bug I have ever reported has made it to live, the only exception being in WoD beta when looting quest items literally killed your character. Blizz just doesn't pay attention to bug reports.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it doesn't, The entire purpose of Alpha/Beta is to test for bugs / exploits and report them, All this does is highlight to a large amount of people the issues / unfinished content and boost the streamers view count, They won't even be reporting or testing things only treating it as a demo.</div></div><hr />

This isn't how software is made, bugs get logged but normally they have much more pressing matters to deal with and bugs get fixed if they're big issues.</div></div><hr />

I mean... common. Once I get my invite/code I'll sell it to some sucker for 200USD or even more.<br />
You won't get a code. If you 'sell' your access, you would be selling your battle.net account.<br />

Don't be desperate for this crap. You deserve better. And most certainly don't be desperate enough to buy. Realize that you pay through the nose for nothing new basically.<br />
<br />
I like what I'm seeing.<br />
<br />
I prepurchased for the allied races and I know I will be playing on launch night. Simple as that really. I enjoy the game. As I do my other MMORPGs. If I enjoy a game I'll pre order/buy it on launch. Nothing really else I can say.<br />
<br />
Plus Zandalar having a desert zone already nails it for me since I like desert zones a lot. Kul Tiras from what I've seen so far looks nice as well.<br />
<br />
As for a beta/alpha code NEVER bloody buy one. The risk of getting scammed is too high.</div></div><hr />

This. Expansions never really shake up a game much. Patches do for the most part.<br />
<br />
Stormblood didn't really bring much outside of Red Mage and Samurai other than the same formula but I don't mind that. Eureka is coming soon (at bloody last) which should be interesting if they do it right.<br />
<br />
WoW expansions have been the same since TBC. Similar content but with new additions such as races, classes and whatnot.</div></div><hr />

They activate accounts, they do not give out codes. They may generate codes for giveaways later but there are none to sell right now. This wave is just for hype builders</div></div><hr />

I know you're talking about mmos and wow specifically which is good and bad thing for mmos, but that statement is very true and everything that is wrong with game developement these days.<br />
<br />
Expansions used to be aptly named, expansions to the main game, expanding on things already laid out, look back to D2, a somewhat unpopular game until expansions that changed the game dramatically and now people actually forget at how much hate original D2 got for not being an upgraded D1 (D3 also but no where near as much) WC3 TFT reshaped how the game was played in both standard and custom games etc etc WOW was this way too once imo with TBC however that could very well just be the rose tinted glasses (even though i really did not like TBC)<br />
<br />
Todays &quot;expansions&quot; are really just glorified DLC season passes.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
It's free advertising, it has become the norm for video games now, many young people will buy a game simply because someone they watch on youtube plays it, good example right now is wolcen, Rhykker the d3 guy did a video on it and video comments are filled with people saying they bought this completely unfinished, early alpha stage game because of his video.<br />
<br />
Why pay people like Mr T to do a commercial to advertise your game when you can give someone free access to your testing phase and let them self advertise it to everyone for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you mean?<br />
<br />
Though I agree that I like it the way it is atm, seeing where they've moved the menu buttons and the bags makes me cringe. It looks like bad placement by someone with an addon. I use keybinds for my main spells, so where they are placed on the screen don't matter, but I'd like to look somewhat aestethic, which I don't think this does.<br />

Well... in this case I like the current default better, and I'd like to avoid as many addons as possible. I got fed up with updating and sorting settings in TBC already. Does Barrtender even offer borders around the keys? I haven't used it in 10 years or so.</div></div><hr />

Bartender has millions of options that you can customize to exactly how you want. Im sure you could make it look the old way. There will prolly be an option for in in BFA. Personally i have no idea how you play on the default UI its horrible imo. Also addons are insanly easy to manage now no more putting them into folders yourself download the curse app ( now twich app) and it all does it automatically for you.</div></div><hr />

If they have reduced the number of buttons within the code, even bartender will only allow the set number of buttons the API will allow. The game currently allows you to create 10 action bars (using addons) with 12 buttons each, so that is 120 buttons in total if you wish to have that many. If they have reduced it to 6 per bar, that will be 60 buttons, which is a loss of almost half the amount of buttons in legion. That is seriously going to piss a lot of people off.<br />
<br />
PS no addons allowed in alpha</div></div><hr />

From what I could tell the amount of buttons is still the same? They just moved them around.</div></div><hr />

I know lots of people do it, but I DESPISE the huge grid of buttons at the bottom of the screen. Not only does it cover up a bunch of screen space and hides things under them, but nothing says &quot;clicker&quot; more than that.<br />
<br />
The new UI isn't horrible I guess, but just shoving the menu bar and bag buttons into the far bottom right corner (which is what many people do with addons) just screams &quot;LAZY&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Ill copy and paste this from another comment because it applies here.<br />

I use macros and keybinds. That's how I play on the default UI. It works just as well as it did with addons back in TBC/WotLK which is the last time I used addons for frames/action bars. I am main role healer and have been since early TBC.<br />

Obviously i do have some addons, like Bagnon, but I don't have any that enhances my frames or action bars.</div></div><hr />

the presence of keybinds should be enough to dispel that impression , anyway i'm not shying away for the utility spells i'm a clicker too and having them clumped there together is faster than zigzag across the screen like you would in the normal layout</div></div><hr />

Well thats fair enough try bartender at least if you get the chance. I dont like the normal UI because of all the extra frames and i like to be able to move bars wherever i want, i can also change the size of them to occupy more or less space or even make them invisable outside of combat the things you can do are endless.</div></div><hr />
