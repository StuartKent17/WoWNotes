It's time for one last model preview of Tier 11 models, I have most of the sets fixed now and most of them should be very close to what you will have on live servers. <br />
<br />
<br />
There are a few bugs with missing textures on male models, I'll have to wait for Blizzard to fix that.<br />
Some of the models for gloves/boots might be wrong but ... well, it's barely noticeable and I probably got most of them right.<br />
I added the missing belts on most sets. (Sets are still 5 pieces, we're just talking about non-set with matching skins here)<br />
All the effects on sets are fixed. <br />
Yes, the multi race screenshots / videos for each set / super awesome preview will be available very soon. <br />

Warlock set looks terrible. I could live with it as a dungeon or crafted set, but for tier gear that is shockingly bad.<br />
<br />
The warlock set does indeed look like something that is more like a blue dungeon set, pretty disappointing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally agree! First Warlock set looks horrible, the helm is....bleh! first time in a LONG time I will be hiding my helm. :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mackeyser</div><div class="date">2010-10-17, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DKs, Mages and Warlocks look tremendous. <br />
<br />
I can't wrap my noodle around the Priest look, but that's me. Clearly, some folks like it. I don't play a priest, so hopefully those who play priests like it. And the Rogues? So, as a rogue (I have an 80 alt rogue), I'm supposed to stealth into the shadows with NEON on my humongous shoulders? <br />
<br />
Shaman look okay, but I'm confused about the spikes. They look like the Rogue armor from a few tiers back. Would probably look better as the rogue armor, actually... ('cept for the kilt, 'course). <br />
<br />
Neon rogues... yeah, that's new...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darklenne</div><div class="date">2010-10-17, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate the Priest set. Especially the shoulders. IMO, Priest Heroic T10 was the best looking Tier set in the whole of Wrath, and it going to be painfull going from sexy silver to whatever the fuck T11 is :( Only saving grace, I like the fact that it will show the midrift of my Nelf. Dissapointing for me. <br />
<br />
I do however like the other sets. Particularly the Warrior set.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jin</div><div class="date">2010-10-17, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wonder how these sets look on goblins and worgens, will they be shown too?</div></div><hr />

Pants of the Warrior /Paladin, they are not only textures anymore but the armour plates realy are popping out<br />
<br />
They are finally getting away fro the sexy textured bodyglove nearly every previous set used to be :) (ofc despite the shoulder/helmets which have always been new and interesting)</div></div><hr />

Priests and warlocks look horrible, for totally different reasons nevertheless. (wtF is up with those head textures) And druids, rogues and hunters look as bad as always. Still kind of hopeful on the shaman set though, once I see it on a dwarf or an orc.</div></div><hr />

But I kinda think the Druid set would be better suited to shamans... what with all that lightning.<br />

On the topic of Shaman sets, there is always one joker who runes photos... in the shaman pic, there are 2, one thought it would be good to go topless, and the other Has his eyes closed...</div></div><hr />

You look at the DK set, and yes, you can see they are clad in Plate. Even the paladins (in crystal again?) are clad in something that appears solid. But then you get to the warrior set, and it really looks as though it belongs to a Shaman (except for the helm).<br />
<br />
Just picking the best from each armor class, i'd say BK wins Plate, Murlocstalker Mail, Druid feathers for leather, and the OMaGez win hands down in the cloth department.<br />
<br />
Biggest losers are Warlocks; you've had a long run of awesome armor, but now you get a giant fish hook in your head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
u have to congradulate blizzard for their minimum effort in armor diversity. why do the refuse to add more armors and different sets is beyond me. set recoloring only shows complete lack of imagination and shows how much blizzard cares about whole &quot;clone issue&quot;.<br />

wow-europe (or US forums)/cataclysm/ vanitz slots 2<br />

spamm the thread for more armor options cause this is getting rediculous with whole recoloring idea</div></div><hr />

Tbh, the Helmet, Shoulders, Gloves and Shoes need to be switched around.<br />

Easy way to tell if they're meant to be together is by the colour of the gem things on them, one set has Purple, the other set has Green-ish coloured gem things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Death Knight - Awesome. Best they've ever had.<br />
<br />
Druid - Looks good on Trolls and Tauren. The graphics on Humans are decieving it's true looks<br />
<br />
Hunter - I lol'd.<br />
<br />
Mage - Best set they've ever had. Very well done, and good source theme for it.<br />
<br />
Paladin - Still can't decide. To me the helm looks really stupid, but that's what interface options are for. The rest is good.<br />
<br />
Priest - IMO, this looks very good on every race EXCEPT Humans. Great set. Look at it elsewhere on other models.<br />
<br />
Rogue - Terrible. Just Terrible.<br />
<br />
Shaman - I don't understand the hate. I really like this set. Especially on Orcs.<br />
<br />
Warlock - I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
Warrior - Total Beast. Looks incredible on Orcs, and I can't wait to wear it on mine.<br />
<br />
On the whole. GG Blizz. I like most of these quite a lot, and they're all very unique from one another, something absent from Wrath sets. Roll on Cata!</div></div><hr />

The other sets are fantastic. Some of the best sets in a long while. Loving the priest hood/shoulders and think the hunter gear, while some of them may have to get used to it, is FANTASTIC &lt;3 :)</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you but I'm liking my class set (Paladin) :D<br />
Besides this is only the first raid tier for Cata, I suppose sets will get more awesome looking as Cata progress further into other T12 &amp; further.<br />
I'm still holding on to my faith that Blizzard will make an awesome looking tier like the T2 Paladin set ^^</div></div><hr />

That's why I fail to understand the lack of proper preview models and variations. Slapping the gear on humans makes anything look halfassed - the effort of the preview itself aswell.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree, except that I think the rogue set is really awesome. I think Blizzard did a good job on the theme (soo much better then ICC) and all classes just fit (except Warlock, sorry). I also hope, at least it seems like it that they are trying to make different color schemes for the 3 specs, I mean it can't be a coincidence that the DK has a blood, unholy and frost look and the Mage has a fire, arcane and frost look, etc. All of them have a certain spec look to them, that would be truly awesome.</div></div><hr />

I love the colours, WoW has always been a very colourful game, more cartoonish. I hate the boring ICC sets, in fact the whole instance was tasteless. (But I guess that it had to be dark and grey) Ulduar on the other hand was colourful and stuff, I loved it!!<br />
<br />
Cataclysm is gonna have a lot of elementals and stuff in them, which means a lot of colour, so live with it.<br />
<br />
You guys are overreacting saying they look like clown sets, obviously you never seen a proper clown, they have a lot of colour combinations, these sets don't they stick to one colour scheme fitting the class/spec. Thanks Blizzard, they are truly awesome!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mage tier looks more warlocky than mage, but its nice to see mages look somewhat scary for a change.<br />
<br />
Warlock gear reminds me of their Tier 4 but somehow looks worse.<br />
<br />
And now that I've seen the paladin gear in different colors it's not all that bad, except the helm.<br />
<br />
The warrior gear is going to look amazing on anything but humans, belf warrior gonna be cool too.<br />
<br />
I like this art direction, WotLK had the most depressing colors, everything was blue black grey white or brown, it was somewhat more realistic, but I love the crazy glowing array of colors, and I hope this expansion is all about bright areas and colors, bring some life back to WoW.</div></div><hr />

A face over the crotch. Really? The mages will never stop making fun of us. The free interrupt provided by the set bonus will be nice.

I hope future tiers are as varied as t11.</div></div><hr />

This way people can choose or mix and match what they like best and they resolve the issue where some classes just need to farm 1 set for 3 specs while other classes need 2 or 3 different sets for 3 specs.</div></div><hr />

Take scraps from a druid tier piece, take a DK helm and step on its horns, stitch in a few pieces of the lock tier 10 and Voila! insta lock T-11!<br />
<br />
Seriously, I understand that us locks have gotten away with having cool sets for a long time, but what did we do to deserve being so soundly punished? The mages look more like warlocks than we do.<br />

<br />
It's nice that all classes are getting unique sets, but I'm not really impressed. BC armor design was a tough act to follow and these (to me) are clearly inferior. <br />
<br />
A few are too similar to past sets, like druid gets yet another leafy/feathery shoulder thing, this iteration being the most &quot;blah&quot; of them all. Mage gets yet another hooded robe. <br />
<br />
And then a few are just gaudy/tacky. Like priest. What exactly is that supposed to look like? Pyschodellic blob? And Rogue... wouldn't be tough to hide in the shadows when your face is luminescent?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Death Knight - Seems to be derived from Deathwing/Ragnaros' designs. It's very cool and is probably the best set they've had.<br />
<br />
Druid - Derived from Uldum. This is also a very cool design, and the wings remind me of Malfurion's new model which is very cool.<br />
<br />
Hunter - Vashjir art style. Toxic murloc? Nom nom nom.<br />
<br />
Mage - Modeled after Ragnaros. It's awesome.<br />
<br />
Paladin - Deepholm art style. It is also very cool looking. The helm seems a bit tall to me however.<br />
<br />
Priest - Vashjir art style. I was like &quot;Ugh&quot; at first and then I was like &quot;Yeah!&quot;. Took a while for this set to grow on me, but it's really cool.<br />
<br />
Rogue - (My Favorite) Uldum art style. MYSTICAL ARABIAN ASSASSIN GO! YEAH!<br />
<br />
Shaman - Twilight Highlands art style. It's not fantastic, nor is it bad, it's just... okay... it doesn't stick out to me.<br />
<br />
Warlock - Twilight Highlands art style. Same as the shaman. Just, okay.<br />
<br />
Warrior - Deepholm art style, specifically the stone giants. My second favorite. Nothing says powerful warrior like wearing 10-ton rocks as armor. The mock Deathchin is a good touch.<br />
<br />
Verdict - These sets are all great in my eyes. I think the mixed reaction is because of how artistic and stylized they are. The more artistic/stylized you make something, the more subjective it becomes to taste.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree with you...<br />
<br />
And what's with all the belt now having the &quot;Rodeo&quot; sized belt buckle. The armor is 1/4 belt anymore and the model looks extremely retarded on female characters. And I'm not sure if it's a necessity to ALWAYS show the first glimpse on human models, but EVERYTHING looks ridiculous on them.

But you can use your imagination to a certain limit and the warlock set is just horrible, looks like a hobo robbed the trashcans behind some fishing bait shop, wth is up with that fishin hook on top of their heads??, hope the peeps that designed(found) that thing read the forums and actually take some input from the people who play the game and have to run around in their designs(findings).<br />
Shamans looks strange, somehow less flashy then the others.<br />
Rogue are funny, for being masters of stealth they sure do light up like a lightbulb.<br />
Priest are a little wierd have those 2 sunwells on their shoulder, hope it doesnt spill.<br />
Hunter are funny, murlocks ftw.<br />
Paladins looks clunky no flow in their tier, I almost see only a couple of blocks of stone connected to eachother wich makes me think of minecraft<br />
The other tiers are pretty okay, mages and dk´s have the win in this tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These sets are very aesthetically pleasing. The level of texture work and detail on these trumps anything Blizzard has ever done before. Maybe these all look bad because people are used to seeing skulls, ice and black shades on every piece of damn armor and weapon? The theme of Cataclysm is - elements, cultists and dragons. The irony is, you are all complaining about unique, yet this is as unique as it gets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Color does not constitute the fact that it brings in children. What an absurd assumption. It merely makes things more vibrant, more lively and, overall, very good looking.<br />
<br />
Also, you guys have the most abstract analogies for these sets. Warlocks looks like a hobo found something behind a fishing shop? Death Knights look like power rangers? I would've never come to the conclusion that a flaming skull-ridden set looks vaguely like a children's TV show character. It's as if you people are deliberately trying to demonize these tiers.</div></div><hr />

I think the Warrior set should have slightly more rounded shoulders to be honest but let's see what it looks like on a half decent race model.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiro</div><div class="date">2010-10-17, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bad Art, plain and simple. This is the worst looking Tier as a whole in the history of WoW. Even T9 looked better, and that tells volumes here people. I'm still shaking my head that a company so large, so powerful, so profitable, that can get any GD/Artist they want, they got the artists they have now to churn out this junk. My 4 and 6 year old nephew and niece draw up better stuff, and I'm serious. <br />
<br />
While it's true that they look a little better on the other races, don't expect a miracle here people. While it is a fact that Humans have the worst model in the game, it's not what is totally dragging down these tiers. Anyways, just go to Wowhead and check them out in the model viewers, Java is better than flash, and go there from now on as Boub insists on putting this stuff on humans just to torture his patrons here since people been complaining for months now.<br />
<br />
I just hope there's new models for the weapons as last I saw they looked even worse than these tier sets if you can believe that one. Horrible. It's a shame that the items are going to drag down the quality of experience in the first raids.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I think it's mostly the helm. Other than that it's okay. The mage set looks more lock to me.<br />

These would all look 10x better if they had more armor-like shades, and then a few key highlights in their signature color. They would look much more striking, and less like power rangers.<br />
<br />
They are also waaaaay too overdesigned. All these sets have so many bright, complex, overwrought details fighting for my attention that I can't really enjoy any one part. They just merge into one big confusing mess. Too many fancy bits spread too evenly across each set to make anything feel like it stands out. <br />
<br />
I'm kinda surprised, considering some of the really creative armor they have made in the past. Obviously they didnt have the shiny production value/ resolution as their models do now, but the designs mostly felt unique and interesting. This just feels like stagnation to me.</div></div><hr />

I can't wrap my noodle around the Priest look, but that's me. Clearly, some folks like it. I don't play a priest, so hopefully those who play priests like it. And the Rogues? So, as a rogue (I have an 80 alt rogue), I'm supposed to stealth into the shadows with NEON on my humongous shoulders? <br />
<br />
Shaman look okay, but I'm confused about the spikes. They look like the Rogue armor from a few tiers back. Would probably look better as the rogue armor, actually... ('cept for the kilt, 'course). <br />
<br />
Neon rogues... yeah, that's new...<br />
<br />
I feel as if blizz has random people they pay to troll forums and randomly throw in that the Lock tier looks &quot;tremendous&quot; ect... lol Lock tier looks like crap. I have a ten year old cousin drawing things more visually appealing</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the feedback is unanimous, and when 90% of the feedback is QQ, it stops becoming QQ and actually legitimate &quot;this sucks&quot; feedback. Overall tier 11 is an improvement in my opinion to most other sets, they look releatively realistic, and interesting (no clowns aren't interesting) I prefer a cool, smooth looking contour to just piecing together random shapes like a picasso painting. something looks bad, but hopefully you dont get that piece first, you are given the option to hide it. some people like the helm, some hate it, some like the belt, some hate it...<br />
<br />
At this point I'd say just give us the choice of what to display like with the helm &quot;dont show helm&quot; &quot;dont show belt&quot; I'd even be happy with the choosing which set design to use and when you get a new tier piece just using the higher tier stats so I don't have to give up my cool looking set for a retarded clown costume :D</div></div><hr />

LOL!!!!!!! I get enough shit from friends, family, and Girlfriend for playing this game. And lets be honest, I'm sure all of us have gotten some shit from at least ONE person at some point.

If anyone IRL looks at my monitor while I'm playing WoW and running around in gear that looks like this, I may as well be watching Barney or Spongebob. <br />
<br />
Srsly, all the models are straight retarded looking. They all have this cartoony, kiddy feel to them. <br />
<br />
The rogue set looks like some Arab, Prince of Persia, wannabe Aladdin shit. Mage set looks like a ripoff of the rogue tier 5 skeletor set. Warlock looks like a circus/devil version of Batman. And hunters? Don't even get me started on the hunter set. UgliestSetIveEverSeenInWoW....PERIOD. A mirloc? Seriously? and some of you people actually find that set attractive? That actually scares me. And the &quot;I'm 7 months pregnant&quot; belts are just icing on the cake. <br />
<br />
These models are a HUGE disappointment. Blizzard, idk if everyone in the building was high when you guys designed these models, but please fix this. FIX IT NOW!</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the tier sets from Lich King until now have been atrocious. Someone needs to be fired for being lazy and using cut and paste ideas.<br />
<br />
I don't see how other MMO games like Warhammer Online and Battle of the Immortals that make less money than WOW can come up with awesome tier sets.<br />
<br />
I have been playing the game since the beginning and yet I still haven't been awed.<br />
<br />
But as for this tier 11 set they need to change a few things around. The druid set should belong to Priests. The Mage set belong to Warlocks. The Priest set goes to Mages. Shaman set goes to druids.<br />
Redo Rogue, Shaman and Hunter. <br />
As for Paladins, Warriors, Deathknights they look fine.<br />
<br />
Lastly why doesnt blizzard give us the option to customize on how our gear looks like. For example I just got a tier 11 helm, I can go to a reforger and mix and match old tiers and change its colors, but it keep the stats of the piece I got. That would be awesome. No one would look the same.</div></div><hr />

Building on this DK - Amazing Representation of the the DK Class is. I like what appears to be the use of the &quot;class symbol&quot; on their shoulder. <br />

Mage - As a warlock I wish this was my armor. This is most impressive out of all the T11 models. <br />
Paladin - Pissed off Angry Chickens. &lt; That is what I am calling all of my friends that play Paladins. <br />
Priest - ehh. Not impressive nor unimpressive. Very run of the mill. <br />
Rogue - Looks like the typical sketch of a Terrorist. No real idea of what their face looks like you just know they were wearing a turban. <br />
Shaman - This is kind of a cool look. I like the pointy shoulders. Not very shamany. You guys should talk to the people on the D3 side about their Witch doctor design. <br />
Warlock - Terrible. HATE the horns. Everything else is eh. I will now look like a disco. By the way, why is there 4 colors? <br />

I think I'm going to have to agree with you on that one. Admittedly though, it seems more like something a warlock would wear. Don't get me wrong though, I enjoy a bad-ass evil set even though the class isn't inherently evil.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know why everyone is hating on the Warlock set, I find it quite enjoyable but all these sets are a tad too colorful for my tastes. I feel like I might be tripping on acid.<br />
<br />
Death Knight - I love their set. The helmet has a sort of pseudo-crown on top and combined with the skeleton-esque face, it's like some crazy, evil, lava-spewing king of the damned. I'm tempted to break my cardinal rule of no melee classes just to get one of these guys so I can wear that set.<br />
<br />
Hunter - This is probably the only set aside from the T4, T5 and T9 set that looks good on these guys. The helmet resembles some sort of frightening murloc beast thing but it really goes well with the set.<br />
<br />
Druid - I don't really need to comment on this. It fits the class perfectly.<br />
<br />
Mage - This is definitely not something you would see on a mage normally but I like something as crazy as this. The colors aren't exactly working for me but the set itself is crazy-awesome! It makes me proud to be a mage. As I mentioned earlier though, this should have been a warlock set, not a mage set.<br />
<br />
Paladin - I don't know why people are thinking chicken... I'm thinking about a bad-ass rock knight that owns some serious face, y'know? I loathe melee classes but this is very, very nice.<br />
<br />
Priest - This set is odd yet strangely attractive. The shoulders and helmet are definitely weird but I love them.<br />
<br />
Rogue - Someone mentioned terrorists... I think I'll have to agree, haha. Don't get me wrong, it's pretty cool but this is not something I would imagine a rogue wearing.<br />
<br />
Shaman - This is quite possibly the most bland and boring set of them all. It's okay but definitely not my cup of tea. At least shamans will be overpowered to compensate for their terrible gear.<br />
<br />
Warlock - The gloves don't match very well and I'm feeling a little iffy about the lower half but aside from that, this is definitely a great set! It has a sort of demonic executioner feel to it, eh?<br />
<br />
Warrior - The cyan version of this set is sweet and the others are pretty good too.<br />
<br />
On a semi-unrelated note, there seems to be a sort of strange rock motif going on, don't'cha think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets hope the warlock set comes in black at least... but that helm could do with som more artwork... and the shoulder's as well. What happened to the cool shoulder/head gear animation &quot;procs&quot; like the ones we saw in TBC? I miss finesse, Blizzard, some finesse please</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dellacroix</div><div class="date">2010-10-19, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to agree, the Warlock set looks just like the Druid one with the vines coming off the head. I play a Warlock main, and I seriously don't want to bother getting a set THATugly. The DeathKnight T11 is without a doubt the most badass set I've seen in WoW. It rivals T3 Warr.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valnorok</div><div class="date">2010-10-20, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok. I created this profile after seeing these previews and wanted to get this out there to see what you guys think. I know a theme has to tie the looks together but here is my opinion.<br />
<br />
Rogues- rogues are meant to be &quot;subtle&quot; not &quot;glow&quot;, Every tier we've recv'd has a theme to it which I get, but a rogue needs to not look so bulky but more agile. Like a silent killer, which is how that class is played. More of a tighter fitted armor would suit them, that &quot;looks&quot; like it wouldn't make noise as you ambush or backtab an unsuspecting foe.<br />
<br />
Warriors- Again with the magic-ess aura on this armor. The warrior class is special and sits differently then all the rest. For starts if you go Human Warrior, that just sounds plain which it is but in a good way. A warrior fights off pure rage and the wantingness of battle. They don't use magic, runic power, mana, chi, and whatever else other classes have. They just fight with rage. Their armor should be more like how Deathwings armor was placed. That Raw Forged look would suit a warrior perfectly. No extras needed (like a glowing aura) just pure &quot;I'm here to thunderclap you&quot;<br />
<br />
Every other class looks amazing and I can't wait to farm the new points required to get the T11. Happy hunting. <br />
<br />

Druid: Not too bad, kinda bland. <br />
Hunter: Bland. <br />
Mage: Ball Chins. <br />
Pally: I like it.<br />
Priest: Killer shoulders, helm is kinda bad.<br />
Rogue: Boring, looks like cloth. <br />
Shaman: Looks like old rogue gear.<br />
Warlock: Derp. Worst looking set. <br />
Warrior: I think this is the best looking set. DK would have been if it werent for that terribad helmet.<br />
<br />
I think the worst thing they did was the helmet designs. They are almost all terrible. Ruin the sets IMO.</div></div><hr />

Also, the people that did Dk's and mages probably teamed up. You can theorize this because both head pieces are skeletons, and the armor looks like it's being broken up, or like chipped rocks. One more thing, is that hunters look worse than all of them, even the bland shamans :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
i dont understand how you think it is the coolest set, i admit, the shoulders are in fact, insane, but the head....ugh i dont even know what to say about it. it's just that, they definetly have the creepiness efect down and that evil look in there....but it still looks like a damn clown</div></div><hr />
