Some of you may ask if the mount is real, it is. Who dropped it ? Nobody. The mount was given to Ezra Chatterton during his trip to Blizzard HQs. But ... who is Ezra ?" />

Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com) was updated with new items, one of them is particularly interesting.<br />
<br />
[Ashes of Al'ar] &gt; Phoenix Mount !<br />
[Nexus-Prince's Ring of Balance] &gt; Drops from Yor (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22930)<br />
[Shaffar's Band of Brutality] &gt; Drops from Yor (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22930)<br />
[Band of the Crystalline Void] &gt; Drops from Yor (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=22930)<br />
<br />
Some of you may ask if the mount is real, it is. Who dropped it ? Nobody. The mount was given to Ezra Chatterton during his trip to Blizzard HQs. But ... who is Ezra ?<br />
<br />
About a week ago, Tamara Chuang contacted me about this, but it was the 2.1.0 release and I couldn't really post the whole thing, and decided to send it to WoWinsider (http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/05/22/blizzard-and-make-a-wish-bringing-wow-to-life/) instead (thanks to them for writing this article). <br />
I won't cover the whole story, mostly because it's been done tons of time since the original post, and also because some people are better than me at doing this. <br />
Article on Tamara Chuang's Blog (http://blogs.ocregister.com/gadgetress/archives/2007/05/wishing_for_war.html)<br />

A proof that Blizzard isn't that bad. And also that Tigole (=Jeffrey Kaplan) is nice, but we all knew that already.<br />

<br />
Hotfixes<br />
The effects of Greater Rune of Warding and Lesser Rune of Warding will now fade upon entering or leaving an instance, or moving between continents to temporarily resolve the issue of the effects becoming permanent.<br />
Pets are no longer affected by shatter from Gruul.<br />
Players with divine shield and similar immunities will now correctly receive credit for the quest &quot;The Ashtongue Ruse.&quot;<br />
The on-use abilities of the Commander's Badge, Captain's Badge, and Ancient Cornerstone Grimoire can no longer be used while in an Arena.<br />
The effectiveness of Lady Jaina Proudmoore and Thrall in Caverns of Time: The Battle for Mount Hyjal has been greatly reduced.</div></div><hr />
