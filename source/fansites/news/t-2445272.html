Damn man how entitled are you? Do you think you're any more special than any other person playing a troll right now? It's literally the best DPS race in game for a LOT of specs. Relax. It's still going to be great. Just more in line with others now.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure, even if they nerf things to the point of unsuable (e.g. warlock back in MoP) -- you don't get anything for it. It's just a middle finger.<br />
It's not like anyone ever quits over it, according to them. They can do whatever they want and people won't do a damn thing.</div></div><hr />

That attonment change would make disc priests a WHOLE loss less fiddly when would be nice. The frost mage one given how many ways they have to apply snare something needs to happen. They can just crap out a whole field of you can't move and then you just slowly kite things back and forth through it when they have limited windows to actually reach you. Short of just making a ton of things immune to snare something needs to happen.</div></div><hr />

while the whistle isn't that exciting, it could be a good mechanic to get back to the other side of the island if needed.<br />

As for the heirlooms, I'm disappointed it's only a new cloak and a bunch of new trinkets, as I was hoping for a NEW slot we don't already have heirlooms for. But still, it's exciting that the new cloak is specifically supporting tanks leveling.</div></div><hr />

The frost mage one given how many ways they have to apply snare something needs to happen. They can just crap out a whole field of you can't move and then you just slowly kite things back and forth through it when they have limited windows to actually reach you. Short of just making a ton of things immune to snare something needs to happen.<br />
<br />
Disc are already the highest parsing healers, that do a ton of healing, damage, bring amazing CDs, and raid utility. The correct word you're looking for is &quot;broken&quot;<br />

Yes, because Blizzard has said they don't want you to need to pop Karma or whatever that Paladin one is to need to DPS.<br />

The splash images are clearly the new feature stuff but the 2nd one confuse me:<br />
<br />
For the 1st one I got: Battle for Dazar'Alor, Incursions and Darkshore Warfront<br />
<br />
2nd one: New PvP season (?), Somethign to do with Bwomsamdi in Waycrest Manor (?) and Dazar'Alor again (?) but whats with the big, naked roid orc????<br />
<br />
First one is for the war campaign for 8.1, the second one is for the Dazar'alor raid. That's why the Warfront is spotlighted in the first one (primary new content) and the raid is spotlighted in the second. If the raid launched with the patch (which Darkshore warfront will launch alongside), it would be featured above that.<br />
<br />
The &quot;big naked roid orc&quot; is actually a gigantic enraged gorilla, you'll learn his relevance in the war campaign. He is part of the Dazor'alor raid, as is Mekkatorque.<br />
<br />
The curiosity is Bwonsamdi. No idea why he's specially represented there or what that place is, nor do I know why Dark Iron and Mag'har are being featured alongside them.</div></div><hr />

What the hell you mean finally, so they're good at one thing, nerf it to the ground? <br />
It's all they're good at</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViper</div><div class="date">2018-11-01, 01:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a frost mage this is concerning. The single target damage is &quot;ok&quot; but defiantly behind other specs, the AOE damage is good within the orb window, but average outside of it - warriors do far more AOE damage overall, the Frost 3min CD is one of the weakest too. <br />
<br />
The whole point of frost is snares right? Like I get if it applied to PVP only, but if this is a PVE change as well then there is going to be a huge FM cut in Mplus, it even impacts out in the world.<br />
<br />
It's still early so not panic stages, but this is a major and unneeded shakeup to a spec that is &quot;good&quot; but hardly overpowering.</div></div><hr />

They thought 7.1 came out too quickly so they're staggering the release of 8.1. I find this fucking hilarious because BFA launch and Legion launch are not comparable in compelling content, and 8.1 can't come out soon enough.</div></div><hr />
