<br />
There's no &quot;vanilla version&quot;, right now there aren't any expansions, Warlords was just added to the base game, which already had everything prior to that. So this promo is the whole game until Legion comes out.<br />
<br />
<br />

&quot;While supplies last&quot;<br />
How do you run out of digital copies?<br />
<br />
Blizzard won't run out of digital Battlechests, but each individual cinema may run out of promo codes. I'm sure they've made more than enough, though.</div></div><hr />

It's usually the case for most promotional things. Shouldnt be a surprise. Also from what they've announced so far about it it's just a digital copy of the game, nothing extravagant or anything you likely don't already have.</div></div><hr />

sadly, movie theater we usually go to is Cinemark, so not part of the promotion. oh well. not going to go out of my way looking for Regal, especially since our theater has $5 tuesdays deal going on.</div></div><hr />

You just log in for them, like any of WoW's Anniversary 'events'.<br />

Anyone who purchases a ticket at select theaters will receive a free digital copy of World of Warcraft while supplies last.<br />

I was thinking that, but we can assume they will on this occassion.

The code will be redeemed for a new acc(bchest+wod), not the transmog. Come Legion the battlechest will include wod and will be priced at 15â‚¬. So, while technically possible, it doesn't make much sense to sell the code.</div></div><hr />

I don't see the issue. They sell theater gift cards (Nationale Bioscoopbon), so I imagine it will be something like that, but with attached promo codes. Either that, or they'll just have you purchase a promo code and let you print out your movie ticket for use at participating theaters.</div></div><hr />

No, he's not correct. The promo code is for a free WoW gamepack...it has nothing to do with the transmog items. You get the transmog items for logging in during the event, not from the code.

The transmog items are a reward for an achievement, they don't come from any code. The achievement can only be obtained by logging in during that time limit. The code is just a free copy of WoW up to WoD and a month of subscription.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way, the transmog items invite people who already play the game to watch the movie and the free game and account invite people who have already watched the film to play the game.</div></div><hr />

It was explicitly specified on the french promo page that the first tickets will come with those transmog, 1 day later it was out of stock and they switched to the current offer with the game licence only.</div></div><hr />

like I said, from reading his original reply, I got an impression that before they made them log in rewards, and remembering that promo site in French posted some time ago, that they WERE awarded in form of redeemable codes for a limited time in a specific location.<br />

It often has to do with the law, for example RaF and Scroll of ressurection promotion was forbidden in Serbia. Had to change my account country to germany in order to access these features. Why wouldnt blizzard allow us to do the promotions when it means more money for them right?<br />

You can login on any account without a sub, on any character on or below level 20. So you don't need a new account, just use your own unsubbed one.<br />
One problem here is if the items are sent per mail, as an unsubscribed account may not access the mailbox you can`t recieve any of the rewards.</div></div><hr />

Like I said:<br />
<br />
<br />
They sell theater gift cards (Nationale Bioscoopbon), so I imagine it will be something like that, but with attached promo codes. Either that, or they'll just have you purchase a promo code and let you print out your movie ticket for use at participating theaters.</div></div><hr />

You're over thinking it. All wow accounts allow you to log in and play a character level 1-20 now. all you have to do is create a level 1 alt on a server somewhere to get the transmog items.

<br />
Because Regal is the largest theater chain on the West Coast.<br />
<br />
In my particular area in small town Oregon, 3 of the 5 first run theatejrs are Regal (the other 2 are a Carmike and an independent theater). (Edit: I just looked it up, AMC doesn't even exist in my state. The other 2 theater names involved in the United States are also Regal owned and don't seem to exist in Oregon.)<br />
<br />
I live 4 blocks from a Regal, thankfully (I can't drive for serious medical reasons like random vertigo from a brain injury suffered in Afghanistan). I gotta walk and with the theater so close, I can even catch late showings if I so chose.<br />
<br />
So yeah, the Regal corporation sucks but when it's the only game in town (and in many towns, sadly), you can't be too picky.</div></div><hr />

They barely exist? Over 1/3rd of all the theaters (10 out of 24) in las vegas are regal cinemas. It's the theater that all the Station Casinos use. (for that matter, all but 6 theaters total are in casinos and several of those are NEAR casinos, lol)</div></div><hr />

tbh I don't get it Vue is pretty much the biggest theater chain in the Netherlands but they decide to drop it on bol.com which is an online shop that as far as I am aware doesn't even sell movie tickets it doesn't make any sense tbh &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

Man that's embarrassing when you make yourself look like a complete idiot.<br />
<br />
Staff = horde races only. His/her warlock = alliance. <br />

Reading comprehension is so hard. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
The cinemas get code cards... they are physical.. making them limited to a certain amount depending on the deal they made with each cinema. <br />
<br />
People who think this costs no money, so naive.</div></div><hr />

Apparently they have a special package that includes a movie ticket, code for the base wow game (vanilla til wod) and the preorder for dvd/blu-ray. Which costs 35â‚¬.</div></div><hr />

I will do 2 things: do the Iron Man challenge again and enter the few BG's I really like: AV, AB, WG...<br />

Good initiative.</div></div><hr />
