Item Level Boost Wednesday<br />
Bashiok let us know that the item level boost is expected to go out Wednesday. Keep in mind that isn't a guarantee. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Blizzard's logic for deploying this on a Wednesday instead of a Tuesday shows how out of touch with the game you guys are.<br />
The logic is its not done yet, and providing lots of heads up let's people make the right choices. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578040982664413184))<br />
Make sure something is done and ready to go THEN announce it, instead of the other way around.. you can lawyer talk -- cont.<br />
Giving people advanced warning isn't anything but positive. You know it's coming, so you can make the right choices. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578041446827081728))<br />
Thanks for the headsup. That said, really poor communication about the intended timeframe for this.<br />
We said next week, and we intended for it to be sometime this week. Doesn't matter when it's applied. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578041585251659776))<br />
Except to the people who raid on Tuesday, I suppose.<br />
Why? (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578041870598582272))<br />
Kinda does matter to people raiding tonight...<br />
Shouldn't really. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578042008473747456))<br />
Oh you're being serious, so you actually are crying over 5 iLevels. Gotcha.<br />
Think his point is it's more the principal of the thing than ilvls. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578046622342361088))<br />
Ideally it could have been out this morning. It wasn't. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578046947161849856))<br />
For one week, on a few item levels. I think it's probably fine. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578047793949859840))<br />
Awful communication as well as releasing for European reset day &amp; screwing over the United States in the process.<br />
We're releasing when it's done. It's a somewhat complex change. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578046947161849856))<br />
any eta on the time this will be live tomorrow?<br />
No. When it's ready. I would personally suspect afternoon. (Bashiok (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/578047423848718336))<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
I don't think some passives should be baked into active abilities. It hides how a spec works and newbies constanly overlook it<br />
This is definitely a point of confusion for some players that we will be taking a hard look at changing. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575385560832811009))<br />

Moonkin Wild Charge (Disengage) not usable out of combat. Design or oversight?<br />
Original design. It was an oversight not to change this when we changed Disengage. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575385273091026945))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Hey lots of helms that cover the face are now broken on human females because of the 6.1 changes. Any plans to fix it?<br />
Art is constantly looking to improve helm fitting. Bug reports with specific examples/screenshots if possible always welcome. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575431807904043008))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Regardless, may we assume that you've seen the mountains of criticism regarding the Ashran changes? You discussing more changes?<br />
I made a forum post elaborating on the reasons for the change and our thoughts on the matter have not changed. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574915532626919424))<br />
<br />
Some feedback about bag space (some pvp related) http://t.co/axl10JB1DQ<br />
Yea we tried to reduce the amount of items you get from ashran. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574926136620118016))<br />
<br />
Constructive feedback on how to get more people into pvp. Really a great thread (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16542424647?page=1). <br />
I certainly agree personally with the premise that nurturing &quot;bad&quot; players is important for a game overall (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575102845214556160))<br />
<br />
Why is Arcane Power is dispellable and paladin's wings are not? I remember them being dispellable.<br />
Avenging Wrath used to be dispellable, but dispelling it was too punishing. No promises, but we can discuss the same for AP. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575384986213183488))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Is there a reason stopped answering questions and just used as an announcer of hotfixes/changes now?<br />
We haven't stopped and we're gathering a bunch right now. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/575367713087877120))<br />
<br />
Okay can you tell us who Gul'dan's voice actor is? Because that dude is amazing.<br />
Troy Baker! He's great isn't he? Great to work with, too! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/575343611321020416))<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback and for presenting it reasonably. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/570775057150009344))<br />
While his initial tweet could use some work, I don't think your sarcasm is going to work for you in the long run.<br />
it wasn't sarcasm. It was genuine thanks. His tweet was good feedback. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574907099945177089))<br />
Your answers are either terrible and sarcastic or twitter sucks as a way to communicate with you.<br />
Twitter isn't a great for communicating tone. I'm surprised people think this tweet is bad. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574907544960811008))<br />
Also to be fair the person I responded to was never unreasonable. Third parties decided it was sarcasm. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574911933272363008))<br />
Ever think that it might be time to give up twitter completely? Not saying you should, nor would I feel compelled to. Just asking.<br />
No because 99% of people on here are great (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574922024566583296))<br />
True story. We don't let the few bad eggs get us down. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/574922357220864002))<br />
<br />
Apparently this is a mean spirited sarcastic tweet on my part. If this is the worst I ever do I'm succeeding. http://t.co/hUEE1u6YxK (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/574909794236002304))<br />
if you think a tweet is the worst you do, try Ashran ;-)<br />
oh zing (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575004227283496960))<br />

Guild Wars 2 is getting some camera improvements in this week's patch. Among the changes are first person mode and a new collision detection system. You can see an example of how the changes affect your view here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3t4iDDj-qw&amp;t=376). Running past trees or other small things no longer zooms your camera in all the way.<br />

<br />
First of all, Indeed grats to Bashiok for keeping a cool head.<br />
<br />
THAT SAID.<br />
<br />
Your second statement is pretty ignorant. There are people from &quot;This generation&quot; fighting and dying in the middle east, already dead, and will be thanks to the corporate greed, grandstanding of certain religious groups of their own country, as well as general human prejudice leading to violence.<br />
<br />
You are right, we are SUCH a horrible generation. The worthless things we talk about are stuff like &quot;this thing being implemented 24 hours after i thought it would slightly inconveniences me and my 9 friends for several hours today&quot; instead of whining about the dang N****rs who are trying to vote.<br />
<br />
Such a GREAT generation you are comparing us too.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should compare like with like, rather than just insulting LITERALLY millions of people you know nothing about.</div></div><hr />

One side cries because there ARE adjustments to the ilevel<br />
The other side cries because it's NOT done during their maintenance<br />
<br />
The only true cry IMO is the one with &quot;bad communication&quot; or let's say &quot;incomplete&quot; communication - the heads up is a good thing. <br />

Two things are facts.<br />

1) The hotfix is not ready yet.<br />
<br />
2) Telling people it is coming is a good thing.<br />
<br />
It was VERY clear that it would be next week, it never said at maintenance hotfixes happen all the time not on maintenance day.<br />

What is wrong is peoples crying and self entitlement, but hey ho welcome to the internet I guess.<br />

How about you guys get a day early in world first progression, because you reset on Tuesdays? And that it has ALWAYS been like that?! Now stop being such babies about 5 item levels. Sheesh.<br />
If it is US afternoon time we will not get it till Thursday early AM so in effect it will be the same for both EU &amp; US (one day after maintenance)</div></div><hr />

The hotfix is useless for the majority of raiders because they raid on Tuesday, and it isn't even guaranteed for Wednesday. &quot;Next week&quot; is vague and doesn't help anyone make &quot;the right choices&quot; since only Blizzard knows when it'll go up. Expecting the players to be psychic about it is poor communication.</div></div><hr />

It is vague because its not ready?<br />
<br />
How hard is this to understand?<br />
<br />
Do you have any actual clue how software development actually works?<br />
<br />
Maybe they run it on there staging servers and they found a massive bug, who knows.<br />
<br />
You have a choice (well actually you don't have the choice at all), so in reality Blizzard have a choice.<br />
<br />
1) They deploy it when its ready.<br />
<br />
2) They deploy it next week maintenance (24th)<br />
<br />
Blizzard are doing 1) and people are crying, but we know this right, every single change Blizzard ever does people cry, moan and bitch.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard did 2) people would cry bitch and moan and it would not be what Blizzard said they would do (deploy it this week).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's retroactive, so if a piece of gear drops before the change, imagine it being 5 ilvl higher, and if it's an upgrade for you in that case, take it now and it'll upgrade when the patch goes through.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two things are facts.<br />
<br />
1) The hotfix is not ready yet.<br />
<br />
2) Telling people it is coming is a good thing.<br />
<br />
It was VERY clear that it would be next week, it never said at maintenance hotfixes happen all the time not on maintenance day.<br />
<br />
What is wrong is peoples crying and self entitlement, but hey ho welcome to the internet I guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, but implementing a raidwide change mid lockout is just plain stupid. Not sure why they didn't just wait another lockout and communicated it properly, which isn't really that hard.<br />
<br />
Nobody cares about the US getting it late. People care about their guild having scheduled a raid on tuesday but are inclined to wait out the hotfix for very obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
Then you could let that slide because it's not a big deal. Or you could alt+tab and tell/ask why they didn't just took that minor effort of doing it properly... But yeah, &quot;whiners&quot;, *compare to people who fought in WW2* /facepalm.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
It's retroactive, so if a piece of gear drops before the change, imagine it being 5 ilvl higher, and if it's an upgrade for you in that case, take it now and it'll upgrade when the patch goes through.<br />
<br />
It's obviously easier to kill bosses with gear 5 ilvls higher... That's the OBVIOUS problem with this.<br />
<br />
<br />
No they do not.<br />
<br />
People on the internet need to stop being self entitled cry babies, but we all know that is not going to happen.<br />
<br />
That's exactly what Bashiok is implying. Not sure how that does any good.<br />

<br />
It is vague because its not ready?<br />
<br />
How hard is this to understand?<br />
<br />
Do you have any actual clue how software development actually works?<br />
<br />
Maybe they run it on there staging servers and they found a massive bug, who knows.<br />
<br />
You have a choice (well actually you don't have the choice at all), so in reality Blizzard have a choice.<br />
<br />
1) They deploy it when its ready.<br />
<br />
2) They deploy it next week maintenance (24th)<br />
<br />
Blizzard are doing 1) and people are crying, but we know this right, every single change Blizzard ever does people cry, moan and bitch.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard did 2) people would cry bitch and moan and it would not be what Blizzard said they would do (deploy it this week).<br />
<br />
And those people have every right to do so. It's Blizzard problem that they can't plan and communicate properly.<br />
<br />
But go ahead start a business and then tell people their product/service isn't ready so they get it late. I bet then people are not going to complain because that only happens on the internet when it concerns Blizzard right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get this at all.<br />
<br />
Tuesday night is first night of raid week, so for the vast majority of guilds doing progress it is a farm night so +5 ilvls makes very little difference.<br />
<br />
Or are you saying (for example) that there are guilds that are currently extending mythic blackhand and there only chance this week of killing it is if this hotfix was released today? Any guild that is extending mythic blackhand raid more than once a week.<br />
<br />
If so that is utter hyperbole. So I am sorry I just don't buy that at all.<br />
<br />
Maybe I am missing something but I don't get it at all.<br />

Blizzard communicated perfectly.<br />
<br />
They said there will be a hotfix next week that will add +5 ilvls to gear.<br />

They announced it earlier so guilds could run normal/heroic again and maybe replace the last 1 or 2 HM heroic/mythic gear pieces with BRF normal/heroic ones. <br />
<br />
The fix/patch is retroactive anyway and only provides a 3-4% dps increase if you allready have full BRF gear, so it does not really matter if it is released on time. <br />
<br />
The patch is mostly for motivation to run normal/heroic BRF again if you only had HM gear or very few boss kills, like 80% of Guilds on wowprogress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
bought it on release and was subbed up until i hit veteran levels and hit the grind wall of quest til you die, or grind til you die. pvp was fun though.<br />
<br />
the new champion system is a step in the right direction and veteran ranks are being removed soon (next couple of months i hear). <br />
<br />
the justice system also seems pretty decent, i got battered to death for accidentally hitting a market trader whilst trying to remember how to play. oops. but lol.<br />
<br />
WoW is currently boring the crap out of me, my raid guild folded and i have no desire to find a new one, playing the garrison waiting game should be an ipad game, not part of an mmo. funny though, since i've done a few highmaul bosses, i actually get better loot out of garrison missions once a week than i do from BRF LFR. so there's no point even doing LFR for me anymore, i have no desire to farm crafting mats or make millions in gold, i just want to raid, but finding a normal guild on my schedule seems mostly impossible these days. <br />
<br />
as such, back to tamriel i guess. <br />
<br />
ESO does have pretty awesome active combat, i did miss it quite a lot, my vet 11 templar probably missed me too.<br />
<br />
(part of the the reason i stopped playing ESO, was they broke the balance in vet areas really badly, i went from smooshing crowds of 4-5 mobs, to dying to a pack of 3 every time. the balance has been restored, i'm back to smashing face again (2h+bow templar))</div></div><hr />

Whether or not you feel that they did or did not live up to their word, (i.e. saying this week, but not when) you'd have to be pretty dense to not understand that releasing it on raid lockout day is preferable to after.

It's not a huge deal either way but it's not like it would've been difficult for them to do things the RIGHT way for a change. It's one idiotic decision after another with them lately.<br />

paywalls for new DLC. much like skyrim DLC. all current content is part of the B2P package, thats a shitload of content tbh. or you can still sub and get any DLC included as it releases<br />

The difference is, in Blizzard's case here, people will continue to give them money because they are not dissatisfied with the product they're getting. Like me. I don't think there's a huge conspiracy to jerk people around. I don't think they design things just to piss people off. I think they design a game around a vision that they have, and stick to that vision, despite the rather small number of people that think they know how to do it better. <br />
<br />
Five item levels is not game breaking. It's a slight buff at best, and will make a minimal difference in Blackrock Forge. Using AMR's new item level counter, my main jumped one whole item level. Not a big deal at all. Anyone that raided on Tuesday or even today before the &quot;fix&quot; goes out, were not gimped even slightly. The sky is not falling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally gain 4 item levels according to AMR. From that, I will gain anywhere between 2000 and 3000 DPS. Multiply that by 12 (for DPS) - and BAM my whole raid just got about 25-35k DPS out of the blue.<br />
<br />
Although I do share your opinion, I just wanted to point that out. Also, I believe it's a bit more than a slight buff. Basically, the whole instance just became undertuned by 5 item levels. That's my opinion, at least.</div></div><hr />

It is not. They only said next week. No date. It can happen in any day of the week.<br />
<br />
If they're still testing (really, the only test for it is checking if it's applying to older items instead of only new ones) or even reconsidering doing that, no problem at all.<br />
<br />
People think that it should be on when they want for their convenience, but it's their problem and not Blizzard's fault. It's the same crap with their hotfixes on any day of the week that could just change something for whoever already pvped, who already raided, etc.<br />
<br />
They even said it earlier, so when something drops, you keep it instead of DE, that's why they say it was &quot;a good thing&quot; talking about their plans. Imagine all the complains about it if they just dropped the hotfix today while people raided since that day and trashed everything.</div></div><hr />

Hotfixes usually if not always go out on the same day across realms because they're deployed as soon as ready... and you just EXPECTED that they'd be out for your reset. Boo hoo.<br />

To take the contrarian position, just for fun - maybe if Bashiok had been more clear that the fix wasn't scheduled for any day specifically, there would be less upset players, who've been trained to expect big changes on maintenance days. <br />
<br />
Bashiok - and Blizzard - knows at this point how their community acts. Bashiok isn't new to the job, he should know better than to drop vague targets for things like this. If he'd taken 20 seconds to type out &quot;We hope to get this out Tuesday, but it could be Wednesday or Thursday&quot;, there'd be no complaining. It's his job to forsee the effects of his words, and if he can't, or can't be bothered (more likely), then this is going to happen every damned time he posts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hotfixing a boss &lt;&gt; hotfixing item levels...<br />
<br />
Dude, world 1sts are alread over, that's the only time they think about not hotfixing a BOSS in the middle of raid week, when the competition is still going. They usually hotfix bosses when that is over. Plenty of times they did it in SoO for example.<br />
<br />
This is not aimed at Mythic raiding, not aimed at groups that are actually progressing. It's aimed at normal/heroic players that can't go from normal HM to normal BRF and heroic HM to heroic BRF, people that are killing lower dificulty BRF bosses and can't get an upgrade from them because it's lower ilvl.<br />
<br />
Reset day is mostly farm day for most players. They never gave a date, only the timeframe for it. Get over it and just do what they told you, to keep anything you find interesting that dropped, but you would trash it because it's weaker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Screwing progression for people? How do you figure? They don't HAVE to increase the ilvls of the gear, but are and they said it would be this week. If your progression is screwed because it didn't happen on Tuesday, then you probably have larger issues in your raid. <br />
<br />
Being told you're going to be given something for no effort on your part and then whining when you don't get it at precisely the right time is the very definition of childish entitlement. Yelling at the people giving it to you is just plain ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Bashiok - and Blizzard - knows at this point how their community acts. Bashiok isn't new to the job, he should know better than to drop vague targets for things like this. If he'd taken 20 seconds to type out &quot;We hope to get this out Tuesday, but it could be Wednesday or Thursday&quot;, there'd be no complaining. It's his job to forsee the effects of his words, and if he can't, or can't be bothered (more likely), then this is going to happen every damned time he posts.<br />
<br />
That's why they said &quot;planned next week&quot;, they already know that if they give a fixed date and can't do it, people will complain. How exactly people been trained to expect big changes when Blizzard already hotfixed big stuff in the middle of week many times, they've nerfed/buffed classes, nerfed/buffed/turned off mechanics from bosses, increased item stats, etc. during the week. How exactly is increasing 5 ilvl bigger than nerfing/buffing a class/spec or boss?<br />
<br />
Anytime they did something that was set for maintenance/reset, they said it was going to happen on the next maintenance/server reset.<br />
<br />
There is nothing more clear than &quot;planning a hotfix for next week&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's like saying &quot;hey dude, I'm planning to go there tomorrow, ok?&quot; and they call you &quot;hey dude, it's already midnight, why you're not here yet? It's already tomorrow!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

imo those questions are way too ignorant.<br />
they get 5 free levels and they dare to complain?<br />

so, don't give those levels to them then. let them farm it, seriously.<br />
<br />
and no idea which camera they should fix, it's working fine for me for 10 years now.<br />
WoW has the best camera and stearing ingame available in ANY mmo till now, so how about you bitches go to your mommy and cry there some more? bet she doesn't care if your points are valid or not and will give you your cookies.</div></div><hr />

My friend bought me and a couple other friends ESO to play as a group. We didn't even play the full first month, that's how bad and boring we found it. So I could play the game literally for free now since I didn't buy the game but own it, and I have absolutely no desire to. I'll just keep playing Skyrim, which I actually started a new file on last week. ESO is just a watered down Elder Scrolls game and a watered down MMO thrown together, and it's not a good mix.</div></div><hr />

Stfu. People care about server first, nobody gives two shits about world first because they're not in the race. People care about what matters to them, think before you make a retarded post. I'm not thankful they're doing this AT ALL. I don't like raids being nerfed. What pisses me off more is buffing some guilds and not others based on what fucking time of the week you raid on cause they're too incompetent to roll it out on reset then have no fucking clue why people are getting upset.</div></div><hr />

Don't get this at all.<br />
<br />
Tuesday night is first night of raid week, so for the vast majority of guilds doing progress it is a farm night so +5 ilvls makes very little difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK.<br />
<br />
Sucks for you.<br />
<br />
So guilds aren't able to progress on the first evening of raiding? And no one ever extends their raid lockouts? Makes no sense whatsoever.<br />
+5 ilvls makes farming bosses a lot easier also.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sick of people constantly calling others whiners or crybabies while the only thing you see on the frontpage are legitimate questions/concerns of people who aren't even rude. And the only thing you do is continue with their &quot;lawyer talk&quot;. Yes, yes, we all know they did what they announced. That doens't change the fact they handled it poorly.</div></div><hr />

They didn't have to add any ilvls to anything. In fact, everything was tuned fine without them and could be cleared.<br />
<br />
All this will do is make it easier. This is not a C'Thun situation where it was literally impossible to beat the final boss until a new tier opened up.<br />
<br />
So yeah, people need to stop acting like entitled brats. They are doing something they did not need to do...at all and are basically doing it to make people feel better about raiding. Basically: They are doing something NICE for you guys, and you are throwing it in their face like spoiled children. It reminds me of a time during tBC when people would complain about something (I forgot exactly what it was...been many years), and Blizzard would make a change that would address it. Someone put out a perfect simile to the situation:<br />
It's like a whiny child complaining to their mother that they want a lolipop, never stopping. And when they finally get one, they complain about the flavor they got.<br />
<br />
They said &quot;next week&quot; they did not say &quot;100% guaranteed Tuesday!&quot;, hell they did not say a day at all. They gave us a week notice that they are going to be doing it in a hotfix sometime within the next week. So basically they could push this fix out on SATURDAY/SUNDAY (depends on when you consider the end/start of the week...some say sat...some say sun..) and still be keeping true to their word.</div></div><hr />

Bashiok? Is that you? I'll type slowly so you understand. The people who are banging their heads against a mythic boss all last night are gimped compared to the other guilds who raid on other days since they won't be banging their head against that mythic boss with a 5 ilevel jump. That guild will get to spend less time on that boss than the tuesday guild. <br />
<br />
How hard is it to understand that if it wasn't ready then you wait till next reset and roll it out then so everyone gets it equally? How hard is that, really?</div></div><hr />

LOL@! Doing something nice. The fanboy is strong in you, you must defend them with all your strength! Everyone in my guild is not happy with the nerf. We don't want challenging content nerfed. There isn't even a way to turn it off. What we don't want is a weekend guild getting a leg up on us cause we made the decision years ago to raid tuesdays so now we're fucked because of it. I love how you STILL don't get that nobody gives a shit if it comes out this week or next. People give a shit about it coming out mid week.

Five item levels is not game breaking. It's a slight buff at best, and will make a minimal difference in Blackrock Forge. Using AMR's new item level counter, my main jumped one whole item level. Not a big deal at all. Anyone that raided on Tuesday or even today before the &quot;fix&quot; goes out, were not gimped even slightly. The sky is not falling.<br />
<br />
For someone else those ilvls might be a big deal. But oke.<br />
<br />
It doesn't really matter how much of a difference it makes. For them it would have been easy to hotfix this appropiately so some people were not happy with it and reacted. The response on those reactions was pretty bad, pretending like they don't know what went wrong.</div></div><hr />

If you only go up one item level you are likely still in mostly Highmaul gear. Personally i will go up 4 item levels</div></div><hr />

Twitter is for &quot;tweeting&quot;. If you want details, read the blue posts. The blue posts begins with:<br />
<br />
&quot;We are preparing to deploy a hotfix next week that will increase the item level of all raid drops from all difficulties of the Blackrock Foundry raid.&quot;<br />
<br />
1) Hotfixes are not during maintenance. They 'can' be, but more often than not they are applied when they are ready.<br />
2) &quot;Why announce it if it isn't ready!&quot;? Duh, it's good communication. &quot;Next week&quot; has never meant &quot;Tuesday&quot;. It means next week.<br />
&quot;Hey, I'm going to wash your car today.&quot; <br />
&quot;When?&quot;<br />
&quot;When the bucket is full of water and your car is in the driveway.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's now 9am, and you haven't washed my car! I have to go to work!&quot;<br />
&quot;Well, then it'll be washed when you get home. I'm washing your car for you, rage less.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yes they can. That said, it's the Blizzard's reps' tone in many of their responses that's equally arrogant and often condescending. It would be amusing to read those Q&amp;A, if it wasn't so sad. One thing the fans do have for their defense, is they are not all necessarily adults, unlike the other party. Neither, are they paid to be polite.<br />
<br />
Teaching by example is by far the most efficient way of steering the tone of a discussion in a right direction, even on the internet. People have certain behavioral expectation towards a mature business that Blizzard is. That example is however, not there. Respect is a two way street and demonstrating lack of it at times, is meant to bite you in the backside, when you least expected; at the least, ruining your perfectly good morning. <br />
<br />
The river of criticism, constructive or not, is part of the job. If you can't handle it with class, you have no place being where you are and getting paid for doing it. Chances are, someone will.<br />
<br />
Noone makes you reply to offensive questions/statements - sometimes it may be best to address raised issues as a whole, via other means then Twitter, simply linking to your thoughts and not 'picking up' the pointless fight or turning around criticizing authors for the perceived tone, when your own, is no better, more often than not.<br />
<br />
Filter through the feedback, deal with those that have manners and very quickly people will realize that getting your point across can be done in a more civilized way.<br />
<br />
Part of the issue is, Blizzard tends to notoriously ignore perfectly polite criticism and feedback on their own forums, especially on the EU side. Hardly surprising, people get carried away. You've thought them one thing - that being nasty gets your attention. And whether you like it or not, you automatically acknowledge not only the behaviour, but also the issue. Looks like ' mission achieved' from your average, somewhat rude subscriber point of view. N<br />
Not only that, they just made it to the front page of MMO-C ;)<br />

Instead of stepping down to a certain level, stepping up yourself might just work better. The forgotten art of conversation ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
They didn't have to add any ilvls to anything. In fact, everything was tuned fine without them and could be cleared.<br />
<br />
All this will do is make it easier. This is not a C'Thun situation where it was literally impossible to beat the final boss until a new tier opened up.<br />
<br />
So yeah, people need to stop acting like entitled brats. They are doing something they did not need to do...at all and are basically doing it to make people feel better about raiding. Basically: They are doing something NICE for you guys, and you are throwing it in their face like spoiled children. It reminds me of a time during tBC when people would complain about something (I forgot exactly what it was...been many years), and Blizzard would make a change that would address it. Someone put out a perfect simile to the situation:<br />
It's like a whiny child complaining to their mother that they want a lolipop, never stopping. And when they finally get one, they complain about the flavor they got.<br />
<br />
They said &quot;next week&quot; they did not say &quot;100% guaranteed Tuesday!&quot;, hell they did not say a day at all. They gave us a week notice that they are going to be doing it in a hotfix sometime within the next week. So basically they could push this fix out on SATURDAY/SUNDAY (depends on when you consider the end/start of the week...some say sat...some say sun..) and still be keeping true to their word.<br />
<br />
Pretty much, the raids were tuned fine already &amp; this is a change that is no needed. But I guess they wanted to give the players some better rewards &amp; help with progression. But idiotic kids are complaining that they have to wait for it. It's just sad.</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't matter? Asking why? Is this cunt really asking why a 3% buff across the board will change anything? I swear these ass hats don't even play this game and have no clue how it works. Do they actually expect 5 hours to be a &quot;heads up&quot; so we can get 30 people together and decide &quot;hey we're going to raid wed/thurs/friday this week instead of tuesday. The fact is any guild competing for server first who ran last night got fucked compared to other guilds who don't run tuesdays and now have a huge buff for when their raid times start. And this twat doesn't understand that at all.<br />
<br />
They gave us heads up that it'll come this week, but they never promised it would be tuesday. Either they release it when it's ready or they do it next tuesday, those were the options. Why should that buff get delayed just cause some people couldn't see that their items didn't change so maybe they should re-schedule?<br />
<br />
If you care enough to whine, I'm sure you can make time to add a raid night. If you can't, then you're not really hardcore enough to deserve to cry over a buff coming out just one day later than the lockout. <br />
<br />
Maybe there'd be a real argument if they moved it to friday or saturday, but you have plenty time to adjust. If you're raiding for server first then you should be adding nights due to the buff anyway.</div></div><hr />

When a community manager or dev says that some item level boost is going to be implemented &quot;next week&quot;, they should know that everyone automatically assumes that &quot;Next week&quot; means &quot;Next reset&quot;. We assume this because, for nearly every update in the past where they announce something for next week, it is implemented on patch day. This time, it wasn't. <br />
<br />
To me, it feels like they PLANNED to release it on Tuesday, but something came up that prevented them from putting it in when they wanted. Rather than admit that something went wrong (Which, honestly, I feel like would have been better received by the community - most of us understand that crap happens), it feels like they went the more lawyer-y / politician-y route, which really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.<br />
<br />
Does the 5 ilvl increase mean much to me? No, not really. My team goes in for progression on Thursday, and we had no issue with our farm bosses last night. What matters to me is that it feels like Blizzard is trying to cover up minor errors with clever use of fine-print pointing. If they do that with something as minor as &quot;Oops, we messed up a bit of code and this thing will be delayed for a day&quot;, what else will they do that with? It makes me fear even more ambiguity in the future when the dev team and CMs interract with the community</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm, the raid groups that actually pioneer raid progression could give two hoots about 5 ilvls. Those groups are professionals, whose skills are such that gear has little to do with actual progression. The complaints are from the couch commandos and casuals who are irritated because they can't progress through Flex without any help. LFR was great in that it provided folks who would otherwise never experience current content, a sniff of what raiding is (I wouldn't even call it a taste -- well, maybe Imp was a taste, and folks still needed stack of Determination nine times out of 10). However, its awful offspring is the self-inflated gamer who now feels that he or she can down higher difficulties. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Large error? What are you talking about? The change isn't made as a matter of a mistuned instance, if that were the case they would just buff/nerf the encounters and they repeatedly mentioned this. The changes were made to give people a bigger sense of reward when upgrading from Highmaul gear.<br />
<br />
Guilds were handling the instance just fine. It absolutely is unreasonable for you to be so impatient about it when it's a change that isn't necessary for BRF progression. It literally doesn't affect anyone negatively, as the gear remains the same as it's been since the release of BRF. It will only affect people positively when it's finally changed.<br />
<br />
They never said it would be on a Tuesday either, they said next week and we're still in that next week. So that's technically a misinterpretation from some of you, not a failure by them.<br />

Why? How does this affect how they've been doing things since the release of BRF? Maybe you think the items that drop before the change won't get a higher ilvl?

You're reading WAY too much into this and it's a rather unfair point of view. Your post is based on assumptions and no actual facts. Their reasoning behind the use of &quot;next week&quot; could just as easily been that they were ideally hoping they could release it on Tuesday but they knew it might take a little longer so they told us to expect it next week, not next Tuesday. Nothing deceitful about it and people are making a huge fuss about a change that doesn't affect them in the slightest until it's actually deployed.</div></div><hr />

Going by your posts, you're struggling in BRF.

Frankly, the 5 ilvls really aren't that important. If your guild suffers so much that they need 5 extra ilevels to complete a boss then the problem isn't with your gear, it's with your skill. Unless you're sitting in the 98th percentile of gear level (680+) then this change means very little to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I do share your opinion, I just wanted to point that out. Also, I believe it's a bit more than a slight buff. Basically, the whole instance just became undertuned by 5 item levels. That's my opinion, at least.<br />
<br />
only if your entire raid has already replaced all their gear. the old stuff is not getting the 5 ilvl boost. For most people, less than half their gear is getting the ilvl boost..<br />
<br />
And it is still only 5 ilvls for those items..<br />
<br />
And it is still only 1 day of raiding that you did with the lower ivl.<br />

It really makes you all sound beyond pathetic for crying about a few ilvl on a few items for 1 day.</div></div><hr />

Your argument is invalid. You'll find my name written on a stone at the Qudus overwatch near Khyber district. Have a nice day and enjoy sitting on your blisters, sucks to get burned ;)<br />

I still stand by my comment, people need to relax. This community is incredibly sour. You can't post a thing without some angry kid retaliating (like above).<br />
Games are games, if you have nothing more pressing going on in your life than to rage over this issue than count your blessings.<br />
<br />
I don't give a shit what you did, you're sitting on your lazy ass right now on a video game forum, judging people. Go back out there and save the world or stfu.</div></div><hr />

The problem is, is that then people moan, whine, complain and qq about Blizz dragging their heals on this and well this is somewhat a minor thing compared to other things that are much more needed..</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's live on EU but.... not all item levels were increased. Bugging? (Thanks QQers btw for pushing something to live again)<br />
<br />
Only my Stone of Fire, Gauntlets of Guiding Light, Fleshmelter bracers and Battleplate of Guiding Light increased in ilvl.<br />
<br />
My Hardened Greathelm, Overdriven Spaulders, Cloak of Sanguine Horror, Sabatons of Fractal Earth, Seal of the Savage Howl and The Black Hand are still 680 ilvl.</div></div><hr />

Weren't the stage 4 crafted items supposed to get an iLvl boost too or did I misunderstand?</div></div><hr />
