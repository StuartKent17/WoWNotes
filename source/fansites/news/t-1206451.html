PARIS, France -- October 4, 2012 -- Following the September 25 global rollout of World of Warcraft®: Mists of Pandaria™, the new expansion to the world’s #1 subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game, Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that millions of players have already joined the fight for Pandaria. During the first week of launch, prior to the release in China on October 2, the expansion had already sold through approximately 2.7 million copies and the game’s global player base passed 10 million subscribers, with growth across all major regions.*<br />
<br />
“With Mists of Pandaria, we set out to expand on the sense of fun and discovery that’s always been at the heart of World of Warcraft -- in addition to adding a huge variety of new content and features to the game,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “It’s been gratifying to see the results of all of the work we put into this expansion and to hear all of the positive feedback from players so far.”<br />
<br />
The World of Warcraft development team is already hard at work on the first major post-launch content update. Further details, including features and release timing, will be provided in the weeks ahead.<br />

<br />
First week and and of course it is declining, the basics in the game is 8 years old, GW2 and Tera and those have probably been forgotten for 5-6 years in 8 years. atleast in wow´s case it took over 6 years for it to decline, most other &quot;wow killers&quot;games less than a month for the decline.</div></div><hr />

<br />
China/Korea don't pay for the expansion they get them for free. But that value is pretty worrisome. With 2.7m copies sold, and 1m sub gained for a total of 10m subs, that means the majority of the subs are in China/Korea. Unless my math sucks (which could entirely be possible).

I'm not playing WoW (I find it silly that I have to say this or else be considered a fangirl) but that statement is asinine. 2.7 million is a lot, regardless of previous expansions, and there is no chance in hell they will all be gone in a month. There is content enough to sustain the playerbase for longer than that.</div></div><hr />

Seriously people, the MMO landscape is vaaaastly different from what it was when WoW launched and it's vastly different from when Cata launched. The fact that WoW, still a sub game in 2012, still manages to say &quot;we have over 10 million subscribers&quot; and sell almost 3 millions units of an expansion in its first week is something to be applauded. I think people who thinks &quot;wow is dying&quot; just because of those sales numbers don't know the first thing about the state of the gaming and MMO industry today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was the weakest selling because back then the game had a relatively smaller playerbase. Yes it was in the millions, and thats a ton of people, but as the game got older it became more popular. Wotlk/Cata was where WoW imo became mainstream popular. BC was just the starting point that proved to people the game had something going for it. It was after the success story of BC that people started trying the game out more, hence the increase in sales, even if people don't think the later expansions were up to par with BC.</div></div><hr />

You do realise not everyone is an early adopter, right? I know a few people who will be waiting a little before buying MoP. They can already make a Panda, they have pet battles...it's new content without the new box. They don't need it right away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seeing as these are numbers for the FIRST WEEK, it's entirely possible (thou not probable), that the 700k copies was during the first day. Which would be a RECORD low for any expansion for WoW, ever.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see official numbers on how many copies they sold on the first DAY, to compare to previous expansions.</div></div><hr />

yeah, but it's not surprising because MoP got so much hate and Cata was just bad, many didn't even bother with MoP. But the cool thing is that they are now seeing the positive feedback and are coming back. I have 5 friends back from GW2 already. It's a great x-pac, and soon more people will notice. The numbers are fantastic, considering the hate and bad press. And this doesn't even include the chinese and korean players. I'm sure the numbers will be even better by the end of the month.</div></div><hr />

Well China has had shorter expansion intervals because its always been behind the west by a long way. Now they have pretty much caught up to us which means blizzard will need to provide content otherwise the Chinese will feel the same pain the west have with content delays.</div></div><hr />

There aren't really any glaring issues that would cause subscribers to leave in the masses. If they are smart they will make reputation account wide though. Don't know how they missed that one.<br />

To be fair, you chose a super conservative number and gave yourself a super conservative time frame in which to accomplish it. 2 million people in six months is in line with losses before, so don't think you're being prophetic or unique.

The sales are still higher than I expected, I thought it would be around 2.1 million. But the 1 million extra subs is not really that much, they already lost more subs once in a single quarter. From this point, I don't think we'll see the subs rising any soon.</div></div><hr />

Those 7+ millions players who didn't buy MoP are likely based in China. In China the business model is very different, they pay a very little sub fee, and the expansion is not out yet.<br />
So, it's likely that 2.7 millions is the number of people playing WoW in Europe, USA and Australia. This is pretty much the dimension of the Western community at this time. GW2 so far sold 2 millions copies (several weeks ago), and it isn't available in China. WoW is clearly still the most played MMO in the Western world, but by a far, far smaller margin than most WoW players think...</div></div><hr />

As for MoP, I've now started playing it, and having seen everything there is to see in WoW since day one -- I must admit that it looks like it's going to be the best expansion yet. Had my doubts, but hey.. /hats off to Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Do you have any clue how much 10 million is? That's like 5 times my small country, for one. <br />
<br />
Here's some quotes:<br />
<br />
<br />
At present, WoW is one of the most played games in North America, and the most subscribed to MMORPG worldwide, with a total of over 10 million customers. The closest MMORPG to World of Warcraft is in terms of paying subscribers is RuneScape with more than one million subscribers and even more free players.<br />
<br />
<br />
{GW2}As reported by NCsoft and ArenaNet, by September 13th (about 2 weeks after launch), despite temporarily halting first-party sales, the game has sold over 2 million copies. The game's peak concurrency exceeds 400,000 players.<br />
<br />
WoW IS EIGHT. YEARS. OLD. And it's kicking more ass than ever before. This just proves it more. It sold freaking 2.7 MILLION copies. AN EIGHT YEAR OLD GAME SOLD 2.7 MILLION COPIES. <br />
<br />
Even if (in 10 years?) the game falls below 2 million subs, it will STILL be on top. There won't be a WoW killer. If WoW ever dies, it will be from age. As long as there's subscribes, the game will be very much alive. So just stop implying that it's dead. Get your damn facts checked, and stop the sheepish hate. Makes you look very sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't jump to conclusions yet. MoP has been out for a little more than a week, and many current subscribers may want to play the 10 day free trial in order to get a taste of this new expansion. Just because MoP didn't break any records yet does not mean it will not do so in the upcoming month. <br />
<br />
I haven't bought MoP yet. Many people are in the same boat. So why don't you wait a little bit before throwing premature conclusions based on incomplete statistics.</div></div><hr />

I'm not surprised at all by the numbers and if you stop to think it makes perfect sense. Late BC is when more and more non gamers got into WoW. A lot of people really enjoyed BC so bought the expansion. With more people playing more people wanted to play. WotLK was hugely popular with the non hardcore crowd so with even more people playing they had high hopes for Cata, hence the very high sales numbers. Many consider Cata as the worst expansion ever and WoW lost tons of subs during it's life. It's no surprise that people who unsubbed are skeptical about the new expansion after the worst one. WoW still has the most diverse playerbase of any game. In catering to some other get upset, Cata upset people from every demographic and only those who simply enjoyed that game stayed. I think Blizz is going the right direction with MoP so far. Not perfect, but improving. If they don't mess things up we will prolly see subs increasing even more.</div></div><hr />

Ofc lets conveniently forget the current severe world economical crysis that might prevent a lot of people to have the monthly fee cost in and lets all blame just the game and not the industry of entertainment as a whole. Lets forget that the whole computer game industry has been in a steady decline and lets all say its blizzards' fault for the latest expansion selling less than previous ones that were made in a time that the whole world was spending much much more in entertainment products...<br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
The game is fine... the decline in Subs is just natural from an aging game and the increase in the offers from the industry as a whole... also, the economical crysis in the entertainment segment is also taking its tool and making people think its not realy cool to have so many monthly costs and entertainment gets the first slice out.<br />
<br />
I still think its a damn miracle that a game like wow still has so many subs, in an aging platform and in a business segment (subscription MMOs) that is on decline, shifting towards FTP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you really judge a game based on initial sales? I don't know about you buddy, but MoP has put great emphasis on preorders and digital sales, and you can't put these in the same box with what you call 'initial sales.' So far, only the most enthusiastic WoW players bought the expansion. Most WoW players I know prefer to take it slowly instead of rushing into things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but I am not making any assumption. The hard data say that after a week MoP sold clearly worse than the other WoW expansions.<br />
This doesn't mean that the game is dead at all, but I think people should really accept it how it is: not a success. I think that Blizzard could have done better, by releasing a better expansion. By blindly praising Blizzard even for this product and this disappointing results, I think people are making a bad service to grant WoW the future it deserves. Sure, the game is 7 years old, but for a MMO, so heavily relying on social aspects and sense of long-term achievement, this isn't only a drawback, but also an advantage over most competitors.<br />
<br />
Sure, it's still to be seen how sales and subscriptions will be in a few months, but honestly, given these numbers, I wouldn't hold my hopes too high, really. The game is on the decline and MoP sadly didn't change that trend, even if I am sure it will be a veeeery long and profitable decline.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 mil growth means 1 mil quit before and just checking MoP, hoping it will get better - most will quit again.<br />
<br />
2.7 mil sold in one week means first day sales were too low for report, likely much worse than cata. <br />
<br />
They can remove raids and still have about 8 mil mouthbreathing kids playing 1 hour a day. While it will still be a success from financial PoV, it is not the game I'm paying to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those 7+ millions players who didn't buy MoP are likely based in China. In China the business model is very different, they pay a very little sub fee, and the expansion is not out yet.<br />
So, it's likely that 2.7 millions is the number of people playing WoW in Europe, USA and Australia. This is pretty much the dimension of the Western community at this time. GW2 so far sold 2 millions copies (several weeks ago), and it isn't available in China. WoW is clearly still the most played MMO in the Western world, but by a far, far smaller margin than most WoW players think...<br />
I don't think it's THAT bleak. Cata sold 3,3 M in the first day and around 4,7 M overall (or in the first quarter, but that's a rough enough approximation).<br />
<br />

Yet TBC had nearly the same subs (8 million) when it launched but less sales (2.4 million), and was supposedly the highest point in WoW's popularity?! Or the fact that the subscriber base was 3 million higher at the launch of WotLK but Blizzard only sold 400k more copies at launch. Even Cata wasn't that much higher in initial sales despite having nearly the highest number of subscribers WoW has ever had. <br />
<br />
When comparing number of sales per subscriber, each expansion has actually been nearly identical. The game is fine. As long as you are enjoying it, quit worrying about what everyone else is doing and play the damn game.</div></div><hr />

1 mil growth means 1 mil quit before and just checking MoP, hoping it will get better - most will quit again.<br />
<br />
2.7 mil sold in one week means first day sales were too low for report, likely much worse than cata. <br />
<br />
They can remove raids and still have about 8 mil mouthbreathing kids playing 1 hour a day. While it will still be a success from financial PoV, it is not the game I'm paying to play.<br />

Well, it's not like GW2 finished selling its copies, it probably sold significantly more than 2 millions at this point. Anyway, time will tell and I am not interested at all in a war between MMOs, which is kinda silly. I am just pointing out that people on these forums tend to overestimate the superiority of WoW if compared to other MMOs in the Western market: it's still certainly played by more people than the competitors, sure, but not that much.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you buddy, but MoP has put great emphasis on preorders and digital sales, and you can't put these in the same box with what you call 'initial sales.' So far, only the most enthusiastic WoW players bought the expansion. Most WoW players I know prefer to take it slowly instead of rushing into things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh I'm not judging anything, if you like MoP I' happy for you and hope you enjoy playing it. <br />

This doesn't mean that the game is dead at all, but I think people should really accept it how it is: not a success. I think that Blizzard could have done better, by releasing a better expansion. By blindly praising Blizzard even for this product and this disappointing results, I think people are making a bad service to grant WoW the future it deserves. Sure, the game is 7 years old, but for a MMO, so heavily relying on social aspects and sense of long-term achievement, this isn't only a drawback, but also an advantage over most competitors.<br />
<br />
Sure, it's still to be seen how sales and subscriptions will be in a few months, but honestly, given these numbers, I wouldn't hold my hopes too high, really. The game is on the decline and MoP sadly didn't change that trend, even if I am sure it will be a veeeery long and profitable decline.<br />
<br />
im sorry but theres a big BIG difference between &quot;not as good as the others&quot; and &quot;not a success&quot; <br />
<br />
this is an 8 year old game, thats almost a decade, and it just gained about a million new subscribers when it hasnt gained any subscribers in the last almost 3 years.<br />
<br />
calling this anything other then a success is just plain ignorance, is it &quot;oh meh gerd best sales evar&quot; no but it is most definitely a success</div></div><hr />

There are still people saying WoW is dying because it &quot;only&quot; sold 2,7M xpacs in a week WITHOUT Asia. Last time i checked everybody went crazy over the success of GW2's 2M in a week. WoW has 10 million active subscribers, even if 7 million would cancel right now, it would still be the biggest MMO, unbelievable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In what world is almost 3 Million first week sales and an increase in subscribers of almost 1 million NOT considered a success. Most MMOs would kill for those sales and subscriber figures. <br />
<br />
What were you looking for? You expected more sales than Cata? That would be miraculous considering there are less subscribers. The initial sales numbers are almost identical to every prior expansion when considered as a ratio of sales to subscribers. I just think people are taking the numbers and spinning it to whatever point of view they hold about WoW themselves, because the sales and subscriber numbers are neither phenomenal or terrible. <br />
<br />
The posts today are going to fall primarily into two camps. Either you like WoW in general and/or MoP specifically, in which case these numbers are awesome and point to WoW still being the greatest game ever. Or you don't like WoW and/or Mop and these numbers are a sign that Blizzard massively screwed up and the game is on the brink of total collapse. Neither point of view is right. But it seems people need reaffirmation of their own feelings on the subject rather than just doing whatever makes them happy and not worrying about the rest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When cata came out the game at a 12+ million player base and out of those 12 million only 3.3 million of those bought the expansion on first day. That's about 1/4 of the game subscription base.<br />
<br />
If you consider that first week sales is very similar to first day sale for mist, Of the 10 million of the subscription base we have now, 2.7 million bought mist which is still about 1/4 of the subscription base.<br />
<br />
It would still not be a good comparison since, as someone else mentioned, China and Korea don't pay for their expansions. We'd have to use the proportion of US/EU players out of the 12 and 10 million subscriptions to make a better comparison.<br />
<br />
Absolute numbers are useless when doing comparisons like that.</div></div><hr />

Unless your pushing raids the second they are released, there's no penalty in not doing all dailies/skipping days. I never understood the &quot;blizz forces us to do 25+ dailies a day.&quot; No one is forcing you to do anything. You can ignore dailies for a week if you choose and it won't affect you. I assume you'll make some response about needing to gear up for raids. Well either you are a hardcore raider, in which case your skill can make up for a few ilvl discrepancies. Your a casual raider, in which case you can gear at your own pace cause casual guild rarely push raids the first or even 2nd week. Or you don't raid, which means you can do dailies whenever the mood strikes you. Only the really skilled min/maxers in hard progression guilds &quot;need&quot; to keep on their dailies.</div></div><hr />

As a side note...<br />
I always felt like wow was catching up with known lore, like....go fight the lk cuz its the bad guy from war3, go and fight deathwing cuz its the old bad guy who created the demon soul, go after illidan and defeat the betrayer (again from war3 lore) but now, for the first time, i feel like we are part of brand new lore and the characters are taking part in it, the conflict in pandaria unfolds in an awesome way!</div></div><hr />

An old blizzard employee mentioned this about WoW and its loss of subs over time, more people as time goes on, will quit WoW than play WoW, and that has been the case for quite a long time now. While there is no other 1 solely based big major MMO out there, there are A LOT of other MMO options out there. One other MMO will never be as big as WoW, that is for sure, but that doesn't mean other MMOs aren't attracting other players to play something different then WoW. It isn't just one game that shifts players from WoW over to the next big thing, it is multiple games that shift WoW players into many other different things and options when they are bored and looking to try something new.</div></div><hr />

The next 3months and the next tier are really going to set the tone for the direction that Blizz wants for MoP. For me personally I'm not liking it too much. I already knew the grinding was going to be bad but damn I didn't expect to dislike it as much as I have. Grinding dailies for 2 hours a day because they're REQUIRED for high end raiding is rough on top of the high amount of hours we're putting in for raid. I wish we had a choice like in Cata when you could do all of your heroic 5man dailies in one day incase you were too busy on like a Tuesday and couldn't make it on. What really gets me though is their lack of interest for Alts. No one in his right mind is going to grind out 200 dailies a week just to grind out another 200 dailies on EVERY SINGLE ALT. I'm already fairly certain of the future though. Quite sure that normal is getting nerfed come Tuesday, perhaps as late as next Tuesday. I'm fairly certain that heroics will be nerfed someday in February and I'm certain that if that day is before new content, I'm certain I'm done. WoW's best advantage is that there isn't any good competition out. Everything is &quot;meh&quot; at best. We'll see how the future pans out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I mean to say is that those saying wow is dying are treating this like a non existing object, they assume it will fall in subscribers. Its's their assumption. But how can they make a assumption based on my opinion? I do enjoy every second of WoW. I will not quit if it lacks content for a while, maybe take a break but never quit. You with the same thoughts as me wont.<br />
<br />
So tell me dear haters, who are your assumption based on? We are already saying we love WoW and wont quit, but you still keep barbling us with random opinions that you assume are our but aren't. We enjoy WoW, almost everyone does. <br />
<br />
Stop trying to make our choices, we decide them for ourselves and so far everyone is enjoying MoP. Even if it were to drop like to 8 million as some of you say, which most likely will never happen' for obvious reasons. Such as the lasting appeal of the game is strong.<br />
<br />
WoW will never get crushed, Blizzard alone has the power. <br />
<br />
Think blizzards subscribers as a stomach. If you eat fast up your food you won't feel filled, and want more. What happend? You eat more, and your stomach will hurt after a while. Meaning you learned a lesson to not eat your food in haste. <br />
<br />
You may say, what kind of stupid example was that? It's actually a clever one giving a demonstration of the market. How? Just because blizzard peaked their subscribers at 12 million it doesn't mean that all of them are satisfied. Many of them just bought WoW to try it out, didn't like, left it. That's how it works, people try new products just for their curiosity. If they don't like it, they leave, doesn't mean Blizzard is losing on loyal players.<br />
<br />
Another example if you didn't get my first example:<br />
<br />
My DPS is at a average on a Boss 70-75k ish. My burst, also, the peak of my burst hits 125k DPS. Now will it stay for 125k? No, it will diminish after a while, and drop me to a stable DPS. It's actually very logical, many may find the quite hard to understand. But think this through yourself. <br />
<br />
You're a guy, or a girl w/e. You're not the typical gamer, but you're kind of a casual gamer. You've heard of WoW for many years, but never given a thought of playing it. Now what do you do? You start buying it, try it out and love it for a good time. You don't feel WoW was quite the thing for you, or actually gaming, what do you do? You leave the game. It's not something with lack of content to do, but it's just that WoWs playerbase is built with alot of casual players and that occasions like this is very likely to happen. New players join the game, old gamers come back, new players leave, the one that left make a comeback. It's just how the market works. If you could have the right answers to a market you'd be rich. You can never, you can make assumptions and some kind of logical statics but it's just around, nothing right. Btw, NO, you WoW bashers don't have the required capacity to make those statistics, so no rights for you to make assumptions. <br />
<br />
At the end of all discussions. I don't play because a random plays the game. The reason I play WoW is a bit because of friends, but if my friends decide to leave WoW, it's not like I will leave WoW. He's not there to make that decision for me. I play this game soley for the enjoyment. I love the gameplay, I love the feeling I get when I play WoW. I LOVE THE MUSIC. I love how free I am in WoW. I try to jump around in mountains, bug around in buildings I don't have silly things like other games there I just glide down the mountain on invisible blocks, or when I try to Jump for a building or let's feature the GW2 random treasure spawn things, there the jumping and the locations where you jump from and to look so fake and almos like there's invisible boxes that are far from accurate placed that makes you look like you're flying some meters off the ground. <br />
<br />
<br />
WoW is the game for me, if I feel I don't like it anymore, I'll leave it. Nothing more than that. I'm not passionated to be a subscriber to WoW. I jus play soley for my own reason and I frankly couldn't care lses if any of you disslike WoW as it wouldn't affect my relationship to WoW. <br />
<br />
Thanks for me. I just had to say it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know... MoP has more than 3 more weeks to increase their subscribers. For all we know they could hit 25 millions. Most likely they wont, but it can happen'. My assumption is a increase around 1 million more leaving mop at around 3,7-4 million in 1 month, making it pretty good compared to the other expansions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've just ran out of things to do @ lvl 80. Not intetested in PvP/WvW much. PvE wise I already have a couple full Exotic sets and plenty of Exotic weapons. I'm fairly happy with my cosmetics. The only cosmetic upgrades I'd be interested in cost around 100g and then there's the Legendary weapons. The only way to get that gold is grinding events in Orr and after doing that for a few days I've lost the drive to play (the content isn't fun/engaging enough to play that much).<br />
<br />
If they put some more lvl 80 content in the game besides Orr/Frostsound it'll be great (I have no problem grinding for cosmetics as long as the content I'm grinding is fun). GW2 overall as a game is fun, it's just a bit lacking at the moment.<br />
<br />
Honestly WoW was always the same way though. You get to max level and PvE wise all you really have is Heroics to gear for Raiding. After you have your Raid gear then you're in the same position I'm in in GW2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Less than half the subs at the time TBC launched bought the expansion in the the first month. (8 Million Subs, 3.5 Million sold)<br />
<br />
About a quarter of total subs bought WotLK in the first month. (11+ million subs, 4 Million sold) <br />
<br />
Less than half the total subs bought Cata in the first month (11 million subs, 4.7 million sold)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So no. Sales of MoP are almost perfectly in line with sales figures from previous expansions. Quit looking for bad news where there isn't any. Or to put it another way, a lack of record setting sales does not mean the sales numbers are disastrous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are still people saying WoW is dying because it &quot;only&quot; sold 2,7M xpacs in a week WITHOUT Asia. Last time i checked everybody went crazy over the success of GW2's 2M in a week. WoW has 10 million active subscribers, even if 7 million would cancel right now, it would still be the biggest MMO, unbelievable.<br />
<br />
The only disgusting thing in this thread are comments like this, actually. I see nobody in this thread saying that WoW is dead. I rather see dozens of people pretending that's the case and thus proceeding to bash their immaginary foe. It's called straw man argument: pretending that someone is supporting some extreme position just to have it easy at bashing it. Congratulations.<br />
<br />
Someone is just suggesting that these numbers are not that good for WoW, which is very different. As a matter of fact this is so far the worst selling expansion in WoW history. If you don't want to listen to that, that's your choice, but avoid similar insults, which are unacceptable. Moreover, bashing GW2 is not going to make WoW better in any way. Quite the contrary, but that's again certainly something you don't want to hear.</div></div><hr />

What expansion someone likes is purely subjective, and if MoP is not like vanilla/TBC but much more like Wrath/Cata then that does NOT mean that WoW is a bad game, it only means that it's not a game for me :)<br />

<br />
Pretty much. WoW expansions have allllllllways, in the first month, sold far fewer than the total number of active subscribers. Considering WoW lost millions of subs last expansion the fact that MoP sold so well says quite a bit. It's actually stronger than I figured it would be. As much as the corporate side of Blizzard annoys me I have to congratulate them on strong sales after a disappointing end to the previous expansion. It's impressive. <br />
<br />
I'm actually a little concerned that people are surprised that the number of expansions sold is lower than subscriber numbers. It's always been that way, I mean, always. We have this discussion every time an expansion's numbers are released.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melanieshaman</div><div class="date">2012-10-04, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I quit wow over a year ago, and have no interest in coming back. BUT, I think the sub numbers stay steady is because a lot of people are so invested in wow, they fear leaving for too long because they don't want to fall behind in progression, gear, whatever. A few years ago, my wife and I took a 6 month break, and when we came back we were so far behind the rest of our guild, and with the content it was frustrating trying to catch up.<br />
<br />
I'm happy wow is still doing well, it causes other mmos to innovate, make tweaks to their games, raise the bar. Wow, really, has not changed in 8 years... all the same ideas, concepts and mechanics are still the same as they were in vanilla. Sure some things have been added, but at it's root, it's still a stand there and exchange blows with an enemy, imbalanced pvp, and a gear grind. Some people like those things and that's fine.<br />
<br />
I think mmos coming out now have had to alter the way you approach their games as to spark interest in new concepts, ideas, and game play styles. I was a huge fan girl for SWTOR, but after 6 months in closed beta with nothing changing, buggy worlds, and same old same old game play, i left after the first months. BW didn't seem to be getting any of MY bug reports..since none of them were ever fixed.<br />

As I said, mmos coming out HAVE to alter the game (if even by a little). I think GW2 has a lot of great things going for it, but it isn't meant to compete with wow... it's a different direction in game. Wildstar has some interesting things going for it... it seems like everytime i check in on that game there's something new going on, or some change to it's systems. <br />
<br />
I think wow doing so well is good for the industry as a whole... but i fear not going ftp in the next few years will hurt it in the long run. Games like GW2 being btp, to me, has changed my outlook on mmos. The quality is certainly there, at no extra cost to me. Time will tell, i don't claim to know what Blizz has planned, but if the rumors are true about Titan being a fpsmmo, i won't even LOOK at it (not my style of game).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If a player, whom have played Vanilla, TBC, Wrath and Cataclysm, can say that this is as good as TBC and Vanilla, and that it is much better than Wrath, then that would be proof enough for me to start playing wow again.<br />
<br />
Any takers?<br />
<br />
I don't know of a way to link evidence of my sub, but I started in January 2005 and have no cancelled or lapsed for a month since. In my opinion, Mists of Pandaria is as good or better than Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
<br />
Questing was fluid and I thought it was fun. It only takes about a week to get to 90, so that's a plus or minus based on if you like questing/leveling. However, cut scenes were mostly used with NPC arrival/dialogue at the end of the occasional quest hub and the end of some zones have a cut scene like the Wrath Gate, but they are spread out and nowhere near as frequent as Cataclysm. They are well placed and contribute rather than detract from playing.<br />
<br />
I did Jade Forest &gt; Valley of Four Winds &gt; Kun Lai Summit &gt; maybe 1/4 of Townlong Steppes, and perhaps 1/2 of Dread Wastes and hit 90. This means I have a Karasang Wilds, Valley of Eternal Blossoms, lot of Dread Wastes and Townlong Steppes available for alts to take different paths for leveling.<br />
<br />
Dungeons are quick and fairly easy on normal, require a little thought but not difficult on heroic. They are a good pace for gearing up and just starting with LFG having random PUGs, but will be radically easy for a pre-made group. This was, however, intentional.<br />
<br />
When you hit 90, a plethora of things open up with dailies. While seeming silly, there's some charming fun with the farm and Tillers dailies, Cloud Serpent dailies remind me of less painful Netherwing rep, and Klaxxi and Golden Lotus seem more standard kill x dailies. I haven't done much with Shado Pan or Anglers yet.<br />
<br />
Scenarios are fun and could offer a nice way for Blizz to present stories from novels more thoroughly in game (a message they've gotten loudly from feedback).<br />
<br />
Looking for Raid will be a nice way to keep alts up to date, though the main will do regular raiding.<br />
<br />
I was uncertain about the Wrathion legendary quest, but I like the throw back to classic WoW. 11 rep per kill of certain mobs, need to grind up to honored for one of the first quests. The mobs are all tied to other faction dailies though, so you can work on two things at once with it. It's slowly but surely climbing for me. ;)<br />
<br />
If you want to clear cut everything in a month and wait for new raids, expecting them to be cranked out faster than reasonable, you'll be disappointed. If you enjoyed TBC and Wrath, I think you'll find enjoyment in Mists of Pandaria.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurbz</div><div class="date">2012-10-04, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so, to my understanding <br />
<br />
The Burning Crusade - 2.4M First Day<br />
Wrath of the Lich King - 2.8M First Day<br />
Cataclysm - 3.3M First Day<br />
MOP- 2.7M in First Week<br />
<br />
700k sales in day one seems pretty accurate<br />
<br />
You can't break it out like that. Most sales come on the first day, since thats when the months of pre-order sales get counted. Look at the first month totals of previous expansions compared to their first day sales. If MoP's sales followed a similar pattern as the previous expansions, it sold about 40k per day after release (though even that is probably highly inaccurate) for a first day total of about 2.4 million sales. I doubt that is a correct number, but it is certainly closer than what you got by averaging the sales out over a week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2.7 Mil bought physical copies (Ofc more or less by this moment in time)<br />
the rest probably got digital copies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. WoW is behind on initial sales compared to previous expansions, but still just utterly destroyed all competition. Even if you compared all sales of the competition to the first week of MoP, WoW still won. <br />
<br />
Get over it, WoW isn't dying. No matter how much you seemingly cling to that faint hope (for whatever spiteful jealous bitter reason). Even if WoW lost 90% of its current playerbase it would still be one of the most profitable and highly populated MMO's out there.<br />
<br />
And as an aside, when the only counter-argument WoW haters have now is that their favourite game is 'free to play' then I'm very concerned.</div></div><hr />

2.7 mil is physical+digital</div></div><hr />

The sales are impressive but after the 3 to 6 months, they'll lose some of it all over again. People love to swarm new things, once the new is no longer new, they go on to something newer.</div></div><hr />

Did I miss the part where this sad it was only physical copies?</div></div><hr />
