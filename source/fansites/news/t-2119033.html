Really hope they don't actually change the name of this mount.

<br />
Since you need it... 3 of your spell that you normally use in your rotation out of 4 are instant, Fire Blast, Phoenix's Flame and Pyro since you either pre-cast it or it's instant (I will comment on the legendary below). If you cannot plan ahead the fight to keep some charge of those when you need to move, you need to learn to plan. <br />
<br />
Yes, it's might not be optimal but this is it, you cannot top 3 each boss fight without a draw back. Mage already still bring for some reason the more powerful vs exclusive buff, Time-warp, BR being close in term of power but being accessible to more classes. Melee need to keep their movement speed if they need to move to come back faster, range need to plan their instant cast... And if everything fail, you still have scorch so you still can do something.<br />
<br />
For the legendary, not all legendary are good in all situation. Some legendary on not even good at all. You got one that is awesome in some fight, be happy, don't cry for it to be good all the time.<br />
<br />
So, do you need a talent that give you cast on move above all that? If the answer is yes and they give it to you, don't wonder why mage are call Blizzard favorite baby.</div></div><hr />

-&gt; flame on : nerfed<br />
-&gt; RoP : nerfed<br />
-&gt; combustion : nerfed<br />
-&gt; ice floes : disabled<br />
-&gt; legendary bracer : becoming useless <br />
-&gt; crit rate : something around 5 to 10% down<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
For high mobility fights, it is necessary to have something done about scorch then. This spell is not worth casting at all. Look at the ratio and cast time, if you remove ice floes, scorch needs to get a damage buff somehow.<br />
<br />
EDIT : and actually, instant spells are normally used to glasscannon the target when using RoP and combustion. If that is not possible, fire mage DPS is actually quite low. Assuming these changes are made on purpose, fire mage needs to get a buff so that the sustained DPS is higher than it is on 7.1</div></div><hr />

WTF lol. 3 classes can Bloodlust/Heroism (sorry, you don't get exclusive rights to calling it Time-Warp, Shamans had it first). And technically 4 classes can battle rez but I don't really could shaman's reincarnate as a BR since it's exclusive to them only. <br />

Never meant to say it was exclusive to mage, just said that for a buff all raid want (Bloodlust and BR) it's was the most exclusive since only 3 classes have it. In smaller raid, you can end up choosing a mage just for this reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that currently on live, even with a super good ability like ice floes, fire mages are quickly falling behind due to poor scaling on every stat apart from crit, which is increasing by a very small amount on gear upgrades (loads of sampled data is available to see this). I have never quite understood the attitude of 'well these classes don't have this fun, useful and interesting ability, therefore you shouldn't have it either' - this kind of attitude only leads to pruning and homogenization. I am not advocating that balance druids or another spec shouldn't also have something that is fun, unique and interesting, but why would you actively want to remove something like that from another class? If it made that class stronger than other classes surely it would be much better to add something to those other classes which (hopefully in a unique way) would make those classes as strong rather than taking away an ability?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sodia</div><div class="date">2016-11-23, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except that currently on live, even with a super good ability like ice floes, fire mages are quickly falling behind due to poor scaling on every stat apart from crit, which is increasing by a very small amount on gear upgrades (loads of sampled data is available to see this). I have never quite understood the attitude of 'well these classes don't have this fun, useful and interesting ability, therefore you shouldn't have it either' - this kind of attitude only leads to pruning and homogenization. I am not advocating that balance druids or another spec shouldn't also have something that is fun, unique and interesting, but why would you actively want to remove something like that from another class? If it made that class stronger than other classes surely it would be much better to add something to those other classes which (hopefully in a unique way) would make those classes as strong rather than taking away an ability?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SherriMayim</div><div class="date">2016-11-23, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since you need it... 3 of your spell that you normally use in your rotation out of 4 are instant, Fire Blast, Phoenix's Flame and Pyro since you either pre-cast it or it's instant (I will comment on the legendary below). If you cannot plan ahead the fight to keep some charge of those when you need to move, you need to learn to plan. <br />
<br />
Yes, it's might not be optimal but this is it, you cannot top 3 each boss fight without a draw back. Mage already still bring for some reason the more powerful vs exclusive buff, Time-warp, BR being close in term of power but being accessible to more classes. Melee need to keep their movement speed if they need to move to come back faster, range need to plan their instant cast... And if everything fail, you still have scorch so you still can do something.<br />
<br />
For the legendary, not all legendary are good in all situation. Some legendary on not even good at all. You got one that is awesome in some fight, be happy, don't cry for it to be good all the time.<br />
<br />
So, do you need a talent that give you cast on move above all that? If the answer is yes and they give it to you, don't wonder why mage are call Blizzard favorite baby.<br />
<br />

...Someone got chewed out by the Raid Leader for not outdpsing the mage :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Been fire since vanilla that doesn't change the fact that I'm salty at these completely unnecessary changes. Blizzard even said the class was in a good place damage wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You see, there's this spell called 'Scorch' which allows you to cast while moving, which Fire Mages don't seem to put on their bar....</div></div><hr />

It's actually entertaining to watch how blizzard manage to pull warlocks into the gutter more and more by each patch. I'm gonna grab my popcorn right now.</div></div><hr />

I think most people mistake mages for shadowpriests.<br />
<br />
Warlocks are better atm(just check the logs) and we are all far behind any decent shadowpriests. <br />
<br />
About you other guys tell mages learning to prepare and cast all the instants we have for movement or cast scorch(30k dmg LUL) I can counter that:<br />
<br />
Boomkins, just learn to cast moonfire LUL(forgot you can move in the starfall, just learn to prepare for movement right)<br />
Warlocks, insta dots<br />
Shadowpriests, more dots<br />
Elemental shamans, Flame Shock, earth shock.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm on<br />
Yeah we mages are so unlike you guys. We mages can do literally what we want while moving without even hurting the rotation and dps the slightest while you guys can't do shit while moving. /sarcasm off.<br />
<br />
The last part is how you others here sounds like. You all know it is a lie. A big mean lie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So u mean to say.. <br />
Shammies and druids have certain instant spells they can cast while moving, which means they need to plan ahead and use em wisely or they loose DPS by spamming low DPS instants on the move. Just as u do now.<br />
Warlocks have no dots except affliction. And affliction has no dmg except on fights with adds. The other specs are the most severely punished by movement of all classes and need very careful planning for each step unless u want to keep the tanks company in the logs.<br />
But mages get the same mortal treatment for the very first time and they freak out. Welcome to being a regular class.</div></div><hr />
