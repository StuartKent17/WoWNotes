Warlock Q&amp;A with Ghostcrawler and the World of Warcraft Community Team<br />
<br />
Community Team: We’d like start this Q&amp;A off by asking a question that players of all classes often ask in regard to the very purpose of their class. In this case, we’re looking specifically at the warlock.<br />
<br />
Q. Where do warlocks fit into the larger scope of things currently and where do we see them going from this point forward?<br />
<br />
A. The warlock is a caster -- a ranged damage dealer. They can fill only one role, which makes them a “pure” class as opposed to a hybrid. Warlocks have a reputation for trafficking with darkness, and their spells and abilities reflect this -- demons, curses, drains, fears. All warlocks rely on damage-over-time spells and demonic pets to some extent. The Affliction tree focuses on damage-over-time spells, curses, and shadow magic in general. The Demonology tree emphasizes the damage and abilities done by demons. The Destruction tree gives up a little of both to become a little bit more like a mage with direct damage and fire magic. Overall, the vision is for warlocks to feel less fragile than mages. They have historically had higher health pools and easier to sustain mana, but fewer emergency escapes. Keeping the mage and warlock feeling distinct is a big challenge. They fill a similar role and share similar gear so sometimes even the profiles of their character art look similar.<br />
<br />
Going forward, we want to try and make the warlock experience more different from the mage. Our new plans for Soul Shards will help here. We want to make them a core mechanic instead of a minor feature that can be neglected at best and feels tedious at worst.<br />
<br />
We’re happy with the relative damage done by Affliction and Destruction. Depending on which Lich King patch you look at one or the other are slightly on top, but they’re close. Demonology still seems to lag a little behind. We think there is still room for a strong Felguard build in there. It might be that the pets still require too much management or it could just be that the rotation isn’t as interesting as the ones Affliction or Destruction use right now. Demonology suffers from a little bit of the same problem as the Beastmaster hunter, which is when the pet is such a big part of your damage you are crippled in moments when the pet is killed or ineffectual.<br />
<br />
Except for a brief moment early in Lich King, warlocks have been under-represented in PvP and we want to see more of them. We don’t want to get there through fear bombs, though. In fact, we think the damage locks can do is in a pretty good place. The problem is survivability, especially when stunned. Now some of the 3.2 changes are going to chill out damage across the board and we are increasing the survivability of pets in PvP. Both of those changes should help warlocks, who historically have been a little better in endurance fights than quick scrums. If those changes aren’t enough, we’re prepared to make additional ones.<br />
<br />
Lich King made the warlock pets more interesting but we think there is still a lot of opportunity here. Some of the pets have abilities that just don’t get much use (Imp Fire Shield anyone?) while other pets could benefit from a couple more abilities. The voidwalker for example does all of his damage through just a simple autoattack. While we are slightly positioning the imp as a Destruction pet and the felhound as an Affliction pet, we think we can make the choice of what demon to use at a particular time more interesting. The succubus has too narrow a niche, and the voidwalker is still used mostly as a level-up pet.<br />
<br />
Q. What is it that makes them unique compared to all other classes?<br />
<br />
A. Demons are a big one. Warlocks are a pet class, but they gain more of their own power from their pets and can make their pets do more than say a hunter or death knight. The way they do damage is different from a mage because a lot of their damage, even for Destruction, comes from damage-over-time spells instead. Warlocks bring some utility that doesn’t strictly increase raid damage, so we feel like it’s fine to keep those abilities unique to the lock -- things like summoning and health stones. But again, we think the real way to keep warlocks from feeling like mages with pets is to do more with the Soul Shard mechanic.<br />
<br />
Q. Soul Shards is subject that has been a constant amongst warlock players since the launch of the game. While we've made some minor improvements over time, players still find Soul Shards to be an annoyance. Are there any plans in motion to make further improvements to the warlock Soul Shard system?<br />
<br />
A. Yes. As we have hinted on occasion, we have a revamp of the entire system in the works. This is a big change, beyond the scope of the 3.2 patch, but we are confident -- CONFIDENT -- that the new system will be something warlocks finally enjoy. (I’m sure I will never, ever regret saying that.) We hope to be able to talk more about it at BlizzCon, but the basic idea is that shards provide a combat boost when needed without becoming a resource that needs to be farmed. Currently too many of the shard abilities are maintenance-like things such as demons and stones. Blowing a shard should be a big deal -- an exciting moment. We want to make shards fun and remove the hassle, but we want to make them a core part of the warlock experience and not a marginalized feature.<br />
<br />
Q. Most DPS classes can spend three (or less) talent points to decrease their threat by 30%, while warlocks must spend four talent points in two different trees to gain a 10% drop in threat. What are our thoughts on this, and why the discrepancy?<br />
<br />
A. There are a couple of situations like this in the warlock tree. The essential problem is we want locks to be able to go down their different trees. When you have something important like threat-reduction or range, it either needs to go very high in the trees where everyone can reach it, or you need to have duplicate talents that essentially accomplish the same thing. The problem with the latter approach is that confusing things can happen when you get both talents -- either they stack (which is too powerful) or they don’t stack (which can be confusing or make talent builds difficult). The way we have tried to solve the latter problem is having some talents affect Fire / Destro and some affect Shadow / Affliction. Of course the problem with that approach is that warlocks use both kinds of damage spells. We recognize that we need to solve this problem, but sliding a lot of talents around is not the right way to do it, and also beyond the scope of 3.2. See below for a partial solution for the threat problem though.<br />
<br />
Q. As a follow-up to the last question, would we consider giving warlocks a better &quot;aggro dump&quot; ability? Currently, their one &quot;aggro dump,&quot; Soulshatter, has a long cooldown and costs a reagent.<br />
<br />
A. We are going to lower the cooldown of Soulshatter to three minutes. We don’t think the shard cost is a big expense in PvE situations. Threat-dump abilities are tricky to balance. We don’t want these spells to feel rotational -- you aren’t supposed to do say Curse of Agony, Immolate, Soulshatter, Curse of Agony, Immolate, Soulshatter. They are there for emergencies.<br />
<br />
Q. In PvP, warlocks feel at a disadvantage against melee classes (and hunters), particularly rogues. What are our thoughts in this, and are there any plans to provide warlocks with a little more help in this area? Additionally, players have often suggested allowing Demonic Circle to be usable while stunned, is this something we'd consider?<br />
<br />
A. The reason we don’t like making Demonic Circle usable while stunned is that changes the ability from a remote evacuation into a stun-breaker. Our concern is locks would never use it except for the stun removal, which makes the spell a lot less cool. Circle is definitely one of those abilities that requires a lot of finesse. Clever locks can do amazing things with it and beginner locks might not get as much benefit out of it. It’s probably also fair to say that stuns (especially chained ones) have become too important in PvP, especially now that we have toned down the impact of some of the other forms of crowd control.<br />
<br />
Q. Pet survivability is something that comes up often. Do we see this as a concern, and if so are there any plans to increase warlock pet survivability and/or consider decreasing the warlock's dependency on pets in PvP?<br />
<br />
A. It is a concern. We never wanted it to feel like it was stupid to attack the pet -- like they were so unkillable that you just have to endure damage from the pet while you chase down the lock. You have to remember that locks were once really dangerous in PvP (this was back when we added resilience for DoTs) and so everyone was nervous about making their pets too powerful. It’s just incredibly frustrating to be on the other end of that and finally get a pet down only to have to then face the warlock. However times have changed and we think pets are too fragile now. We tried buffing their health a few times, but we think it’s finally time to add resilience to pets and fix it right.<br />
<br />
Q. Continuing off of the previous question, are we happy with pet scaling currently? One constant request by warlocks in PvP, is to allow scaling for resilience. Would we consider making this change?<br />
<br />
A. Yes, pets are never going to scale correctly as long as there are some stats that affect the master but not the pet. If the lock gains crit and haste, the demons don’t benefit as much as if the lock had gained spellpower. This is a problem. We need to make pets just scale with all stats. Technically, this is not a “flip the switch” kind of change. It’s complicated so it’s going to take some time to do right. We’ll get resilience and spell pen done first. <br />
<br />
Q. Many warlocks often find it difficult to resummon or switch pets, especially when compared to other pet classes. Fel Domination with Master Summoner is nice for those who have the talents, but still somewhat problematic due to the long cooldown of Fel Domination.<br />
<br />
A. As you probably know by now, we are dramatically lowering the cooldown on Fel Domination.<br />
<br />
Q. Talents that increase the range for spells is often a point of concern, particularly for PvE-focused warlocks due to the warlock's mixture of using both Affliction and Destruction abilities. Is it possible that warlocks can be given a merged range talent in a low tier of either tree?<br />
<br />
A. This is the same problem I mentioned above. Moving the talent up higher is one solution, but it would have to be very high and whatever talents are there now would have to come down. This then becomes a pretty significant re-architecture of the talent tree. It is something we want to address, but probably isn’t a 3.2 change.<br />
<br />
Q. Do we have plans to add a little more burst potential to the Affliction tree?<br />
<br />
A. Yes, and Haunt is probably the right place to do it. Haunt is one of the few Affliction spells that can’t reach the 200% crit level, so we are going to make that change through Pandemic.<br />
<br />
Q. The spell Hellfire is one that warlocks rarely use, due to that fact it's channeled, generates a great deal of threat, and has self-damaging properties. What are our thoughts on how this spell currently functions, and what might we consider changing in the future?<br />
<br />
A. We’d agree that the “interesting tradeoff” isn’t that interesting, and in fact it’s hard to find niches for so many different AE spells. Long-term this might be the kind of spell that gets cut.<br />
<br />
Q. A common concern that comes up regarding warlock players is in regards to their minor glyphs. While they understand that these glyphs aren't meant to be game-changing, many of the minor glyphs focus on improving spells that aren't really used at all, such as Eye of Kilrogg. Would we consider looking at the minor glyphs available for warlocks and possibly making some improvements?<br />
<br />
A. We can look at the minor glyphs. We are more concerned at the moment with making sure the major glyphs are interesting without being overpowered.<br />
<br />
Q. Green fire for spells has been something that's often requested by warlocks. Would we consider adding this into the game, possibly in the form of a minor glyph so that we're not forcing it on players who may not desire their fire spells to be green?<br />
<br />
A. We wouldn’t do it through a minor glyph. Originally, we were going to make the minor glyphs mostly cosmetic like this, but as we evolved the glyph feature we found that some spells just didn’t make sense to have a major glyph, so these became minors. We definitely understand some (many? all?) warlocks would love to have green fire and we’ll try and find a cool way to deliver on this. At this point, we’d probably rather do it with a flashy new spell rather than just change up an existing one, but we’ll have to see. As with the new druid forms, after waiting so long, we’d want to do it right.<br />
<br />
Q. Would we consider adding a warlock-specific flying mount? Warlocks have promised to never complain again should such a feature be added. Okay, not really...<br />
<br />
A. I think it fits the warlock kit pretty well to have some kind of crazy flying demon. We don’t have any art for such a creature yet, but we’ll keep it in mind. You’d have to go back to Dire Maul to get it. Okay, not really???<br />
<br />
Q. Are there any plans to allow warlocks to slightly customize or change the appearance of their pets?<br />
<br />
A. This is something we are discussing. There are several voidwalker and imp models we could use pretty easily and it might be nice to add more felhounds and succubi. This isn’t a high priority, but something we would like to eventually get around to improving. We are discussing whether this is simply just random variation (like the names) or whether it becomes an even bigger feature. <br />
<br />
[size=3]Instance Capacity Update<br />
We are aware of the concerns regarding situations where players are unable to zone into an instance due to an instance limit being hit, which results in a message stating that additional instances cannot be launched. This limit was implemented as a short-term solution to preserve the gameplay for players who are already in an instance and to prevent numerous issues that can happen when too many instances are active at the same time, but we are currently working on better solutions to ensure that players can get into instances when they want to.<br />
<br />
As one of the solutions to this situation, we are in the process of modifying our hardware setup to allow for more instances to be active without negatively impacting the performance of these instances. Once this hardware reconfiguration is complete, we expect to see a noticeable reduction in the number of players hitting the instance limit. However, this improvement to the hardware is a complicated and delicate process that will also require extensive testing before it can be fully implemented, so it may be some time before the updates can be completed. We would like to assure you that this issue currently a top priority for us, and we are working on resolving it as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Further information and updates regarding this will be provided as we make progress in this process. Thank you for your patience during this time.</div></div><hr />

This is why the message comes up in the first place... you going in and creating instances just for yourself..... thats one less heroic for everybody, one less dungeon for that leveling group... now imagine 20-30 level 80's bored out of their mind each starting an instance for themselves.. it adds up pretty quick.<br />

blizzard should lower the instance reset limit. ie: you can only enter two instances per hour instead of the 5 they have now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
For a brief moment early in Lich King, warlocks have been under-represented in PvP and we want to see more of them.<br />
Wrong, warlocks are freekills since the release of lich king in world pvp &amp; battelgrounds, and the nerf to affliction &amp; fear made it even worse.. but you are not interested to fix it, because all you care about is arena and you balance pvp around arena.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. What is it that makes them unique compared to all other classes?<br />
A. Demons are a big one. Except there are almost no demons in wotlk at all. Thats why enslave demon is useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason we don’t like making Demonic Circle usable while stunned is that changes the ability from a remote evacuation into a stun-breaker.<br />
No, there is another problem with circle of lol, it is useless in world pvp &amp; battelgrounds. You can't just precast your circle every 40 yards or so because someone somewhere may snare you. The circle works ok in pve but please stop creating skills which only work well in arena, demon armor is a good example.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to remember that locks were once really dangerous in PvP (this was back when we added resilience for DoTs).<br />
Now it's the opposite, dots are a big joke and fear breaks in 0 - 1 second if you use it offensively! This is terrible, even in pve.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hellfire. We’d agree that the “interesting tradeoff” isn’t that interesting, and in fact it’s hard to find niches for so many different AE spells. Long-term this might be the kind of spell that gets cut.<br />
<br />
Don't cut it, rework it.</div></div><hr />

Altho I already look out for the new soulshard system I also have to say that loads of questions remain unanswered and some answers where not completely satisfying to me..<br />
<br />
**They softly discussed hellfire as being completely useless, and that eye of killrog is never used :) But what about enslave demon? does anyone ever use this since Lich King?&quot;Are there even mobs to enslave and whats the use of enslaving demons nowadays :S what about detect lesser invis? Why not make it see stealth so we can finally stand a chance versus rogues? WTF is up with underwater breathing? or banish outside arena? WHo ever uses Curse of Weakness? sence demons? inferno? doomguard? shadowflame is also rather useless cause of being in close range, demon armour?<br />
** They keep saying that warlock damage is where it should be but I still think we are not at all compremised in damage for being a dps-only class. Nowadays ferals are still doing massive damage, so do DK's and warriors.<br />
** Not really a warlock only question, but whats up with EVERY CLASS ingame rolling on CLOTH items while we can't roll on their armor? Why not make druids ONLY use leather and pallies ONLY use plate? Since WOTK cloth drops have been really rare and its not nice to get outrolled by pallies and druids on every cloth that drops. They already roll on the same backs,trinkets,necks and rings<br />
** WHy not give us a spell/talent specifly versus stun or melee atacks for x seconds?? all melee have some kind of spell/talent specially designed to counter spellcast and fear.<br />
** why is instant howl of terror not trainable.<br />
** Ghostcrawler states that locks are unique cause of their pets? WTF EVERY single class has a pet for some strange reason. except rogues and warriors. WHy is that? why don't we have 1 pet that can do all? and why can't we still not name our pets?<br />
** more a general caster question but melee got all sorts of awesome enchants with procs etc on weapons. WHy don't casters have enchants proccing haste or crit or damage for x seconds?<br />
** why is noone complaining about tier9 setbonus? This really makes me mad. this is back to teh old days where setbonusses healed your pet while all other classes get something usefull :S<br />

So... what you're saying is you're bad? because spamming one or two buttons with the occasional CD isn't my idea of fun or satisfying... and from all the locks I know, myself included who were pretty annoyed at the removal of Siphon Life and removing Immolate from an affliction lock's rotation.... yeah, Spamming one button is just so much more satisfying... <br />
<br />
Only if you're a no talent scrub... <br />
<br />
This Q&amp;A actually avoided a lot of the questions I wanted to see answered... its a disappointment... especially when he reiterated that there is in fact a problem with warlock threat... but then goes ahead to say that a shorter SS CD is all we're getting til later (probably the next expansion where they just remove the class from wow)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm an old affliction lover. I've been affliction until 3.2, when they effectively removed two DoTs out the rotation. Now it plays pretty much like the other specs...<br />
<br />
- Destro: Keep 2 DoT, conflag whenever it's up, spam IN as filler;<br />
- Demo: Keep 3 DoTs, spam SB as filler, weave with SF when below 34% and keep your pet alive;<br />
- Affliction: Keep 3 DoTs, use Haunt when it's up, spam SB as filler, replace by DS below 20%;<br />
<br />
Right now I'm demo just because it's more fun. I can NOT stand destruction for the life of me, and affliction depresses me on its current state.<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with that style, it's just not my cup of tea, and plays way too much like a mage. I just want it to be an unique class again, not so derivative. Where's the class &quot;motto&quot; about being focused on cursing and debuffing enemies?</div></div><hr />

Green fire = sweeeeeeeeeet. Pet variations = sweet. Warlock only flying mount = hell yes! Bye-bye Hellfire =/= sweet. Rather than eliminating this, they should revisit it and make it more powerful or give it some utility.<br />

Warlock Q&amp;A with Ghostcrawler and the World of Warcraft Community Team<br />
<br />
Except for a brief moment early in Lich King, warlocks have been under-represented in PvP and we want to see more of them. We don’t want to get there through fear bombs, though. In fact, we think the damage locks can do is in a pretty good place. The problem is survivability, especially when stunned. Now some of the 3.2 changes are going to chill out damage across the board and we are increasing the survivability of pets in PvP. Both of those changes should help warlocks, who historically have been a little better in endurance fights than quick scrums. If those changes aren’t enough, we’re prepared to make additional ones. <br />
<br />
color=white]Q. [/color]In PvP, warlocks feel at a disadvantage against melee classes (and hunters), particularly rogues. What are our thoughts in this, and are there any plans to provide warlocks with a little more help in this area? Additionally, players have often suggested allowing Demonic Circle to be usable while stunned, is this something we'd consider?<br />
<br />
A. The reason we don’t like making Demonic Circle usable while stunned is that changes the ability from a remote evacuation into a stun-breaker. Our concern is locks would never use it except for the stun removal, which makes the spell a lot less cool. Circle is definitely one of those abilities that requires a lot of finesse. Clever locks can do amazing things with it and beginner locks might not get as much benefit out of it. It’s probably also fair to say that stuns (especially chained ones) have become too important in PvP, especially now that we have toned down the impact of some of the other forms of crowd control.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What the fuck. Are you kidding me? Destro Locks, helloooo....<br />
<br />
There are tons of Destro locks that are OP as shit in the brackets right now. Warlocks are the least played class though, so of course they will have lower representation than a DK.<br />
<br />
Also, ROFL @ Hunters killing Warlocks. The only spec that can kill a Destro lock is a BM hunter. And that's only in a controlled environment, in a group setting the Warlock gets healed for 18 seconds and CC's the Hunters' partners. All Hunters suffer against Aff locks, mostly because we have 0 protection against DoTs.<br />
<br />
Blizz is going to make locks OP as fuck, instead of merely OP like they are now, yay!<br />

Hey man you kind of missed the part where warlocks asked why they still get raped by all melee, with 10x the rapage from rogues in particular. Also, I get what you're saying about Circle being used as a stun breaker, but still it would be nice if this spell had some practical use. This spell is all but useless outside of arenas, and even there it's not very good. It's certainly no answer to blink.</div></div><hr />

Quote from: Bornakk (Source)<br />
We are aware of the concerns regarding situations where players are unable to zone into an instance due to an instance limit being hit, which results in a message stating that additional instances cannot be launched. This limit was implemented as a short-term solution to preserve the gameplay for players who are already in an instance and to prevent numerous issues that can happen when too many instances are active at the same time, but we are currently working on better solutions to ensure that players can get into instances when they want to.<br />
<br />
As one of the solutions to this situation, we are in the process of modifying our hardware setup to allow for more instances to be active without negatively impacting the performance of these instances. Once this hardware reconfiguration is complete, we expect to see a noticeable reduction in the number of players hitting the instance limit. However, this improvement to the hardware is a complicated and delicate process that will also require extensive testing before it can be fully implemented, so it may be some time before the updates can be completed. We would like to assure you that this issue currently a top priority for us, and we are working on resolving it as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Further information and updates regarding this will be provided as we make progress in this process. Thank you for your patience during this time. <br />
<br />
News from the Blizzard hardware department:<br />
<br />
We have installed 2 new elephants to increase memory capacity.<br />
Also the 4 new hamstes have nearly finished their trainning and will be able to power extra intances soon!<br />

The bold is emphasized by me. Since you think Banish is useless outside of Arena and that a Doomguard is too, I'm going to take a leap here and assume that you don't raid that often. Banish = CC in raids which is nice, and every warlock that ever wanted to get insane DPS on bosses would bring out their Doomguard and demand us pallies buff it to oblivion for even more stats. <br />
<br />
I don't claim to know warlocks, I'm a very poor and unskilled alt warlock myself, but there ARE other aspects to the game besides Arenas. And pure raiders, there ARE aspects to the game besides raid. Some abilities work well in some places but not others.<br />
<br />
This is why WoW will always be changing and evolving to balance around these issues, (my own personal feeling about Arena's introduction aside) :P</div></div><hr />

Q. In PvP, warlocks feel at a disadvantage against melee classes (and hunters), particularly rogues. What are our thoughts in this, and are there any plans to provide warlocks with a little more help in this area? Additionally, players have often suggested allowing Demonic Circle to be usable while stunned, is this something we'd consider?<br />

A. The reason we don&#8217;t like making Demonic Circle usable while stunned is that changes the ability from a remote evacuation into a stun-breaker.

It&#8217;s probably also fair to say that stuns (especially chained ones) have become too important in PvP, especially now that we have toned down the impact of some of the other forms of crowd control.<br />
<br />
<br />
This question I find unanswered. the Demonic circle really isn't the issue when fighting a rogue. A warlock can fight other melee characters quite well, the difference with a rogue is you cannot see them coming.<br />
You will no matter what, unless by some fluke you find him through an AoE, take the initial jump. The stunlock and the poisons all of it before you get a chance to react.<br />
even with a trinket off CD to get out of one of the stuns, the crippling poison, wound and quite possibly mind numb are all on and it really doesn't take a rogue long to run the 30 yards or so he needs to get back on you again.<br />
Slowed casting, slowed speed and reduced healing, a warlock is completely locked out versus a rogue without help.<br />
<br />
The problem began when you decided to take paranoia away from our felhunter. Why did you feel you had to do this? You gave us fel intelligence which gets masked by Arcane intelligence and Priests spirit buffs so essentially renders it useless with them present.<br />
A felhunter has always been our PvP pet and this spell or buff is more of a PvE one. I don't get the reasoning behind changing it?<br />
Further more, placing this spell on our Voidwalker may have been useful IF it was a passive buff. We must consume shadows in order to boost our stelth detection which locks our voidwalker out of the fight. this is also only usable out of combat.<br />
Where is the sense behind this?<br />
Paranoia was our one advantage, now we are sitting ducks, paractically rendered useless in a 2v2 situation, a rogue and healer. Its a relentless assault where the warlock cannot run, cast at speed and receives reduced healing.<br />
The poisons are the difference along with not being able to detect the initial assault anymore.<br />
<br />
Can we have our paranoia back? Or can you have the felhunter devour poisons?<br />
<br />
<br />
Many warlocks often find it difficult to resummon or switch pets, especially when compared to other pet classes. Fel Domination with Master Summoner is nice for those who have the talents, but still somewhat problematic due to the long cooldown of Fel Domination.<br />
<br />
A. As you probably know by now, we are dramatically lowering the cooldown on Fel Domination.<br />
<br />
<br />
A much needed idea. The healing of our pets is not very good either. Warlocks may only heal their pet through a channeled funnel of health. this is not like a hunter who can press one button and deliver a HoT then continue to DPS.<br />
fel Domination and master summoner in terms of a PvP lock is not easily achieved without sacrificing some other much needed talents. I tend to only be able to reach fel Dom and never as far as master summoner.<br />
<br />
The talk about Hellfire being a very weak spell is true. the only time a warlock will use this spell in my experience is to kill himself during a wipe call in a raid. We will never use it as an AoE for fear of being killed at such close range and of course because its interuptable and also deals us damage.<br />
You have changed some of our other unused spells in the last major patch, however hellfire remains as useless as ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, the vision is for warlocks to feel less fragile than mages. They have historically had higher health pools and easier to sustain mana, but fewer emergency escapes. Keeping the mage and warlock feeling distinct is a big challenge. They fill a similar role and share similar gear so sometimes even the profiles of their character art look similar.<br />
<br />
Higher Health pools? Not really anymore do we? Warlocks share fairly similar health pools to all cloth classes at the moment. In fact we really only have a large gap over shamans who have always had a notoriously low health pool.<br />
Warlocks in TBC and even in pre TBC had the ability to survive onslaughts from melee because of their high health.<br />
You have said quite clearly above you do not wish warlocks to have the same escape mechanics mages do so surely you must give us much more health.<br />
Our PvP gear does not have the extensive stamina values it used to. The stamina values of our gear and a mages gear are pretty much identical.<br />
Fewer emergency escapes?? the DC teleport is an addition but must be premeditated. the only other on a really instant throw (spec situational, as destro or Demo without instant Howl of terror) is death coil.<br />
Now the issue here is that Death coil, Along with Shadow Burn have not scaled at all with our gear. the healing we receive from death coil and the damage output from both spells is incredibly low, it does just as much as it did in TBC.<br />
Why doesn't Death Coil heal us for perhaps 5 or 6k HP? it deals barely 2-2.5k at the moment, this is not enough by far.<br />
<br />
The reason warlocks are not as well represented in PvP is not only because we cannot escape melee, especially rogues, our Crowd control is not as effective as before either.<br />
<br />
We require more healing due to no escape mechanism, fear suffers massive diminishing returns. Every class has a fear immunity ability other than a warlock who are apparently the masters of the ability. How can we know how to weild it but not protect ourselves from it?<br />
Consider a mage, frost nova, no diminihsing returns so to speak. they also have sheep and the possibility of slow or deep freeze.<br />
if we want to use the succubus for seduction we must sacrafice Soul Link in order to prevent the seduction being broken through us taking damage and it being passed through to our pet.<br />
<br />
So, if you are making an arena set up, why would you take a warlock over a mage if they can CC better, have an iceblock to take a short breather, can blink out of problems, go invisible and have a mana or ice barrier shield to absorb damage? They can also silence on demand much easier than we can as it is pet situational. Oh and i forgot, they have almost as much HP as we do now too.<br />
<br />
Warlocks are under represented, why? its a no brainer really. We haven't as many tricks as the rest and we do not offer teams as much as we used to its as simple as that. Give us something to make us wanted again.<br />
<br />
You can also link this to, warlocks cannot enter an arena battle without PvP gear. We MUST have resilience, without it we have't a chance. none what so ever, we'd be cut down in under 2 seconds with pve gear.<br />
However, because of the Massive burst, buffed Damage done in raiding, Armor penetration and haste as long as a class has some way of stopping themselves from being taken out for maybe 5-10 seconds they do not need PvP gear.<br />
<br />
paladins, druids, rogues, hunters even sometimes Death Knights and warriors can enter PvP bouts without resilience, fully clad in pve gear. Armor penetration, haste, Attack power and crit maxed out for pure DPS.<br />
A warlock and a priest cannot, even a shaman. they can't deal with the damage and cannot get away. So how is it fair the other classes can do this and we can't?<br />
<br />
Plate, or speed of movement, stealth or immunities for short periods of time give these classes the time they need to either stey out of danger OR burst you down too quickly for you to react. Maybe you should look into stopping PvE geared players from joining arena's before you wonder why warlocks don't want to become cannon fodder.<br />
<br />
<br />
a ranged damage dealer. They can fill only one role, which makes them a &#8220;pure&#8221; class as opposed to a hybrid.<br />
<br />
yes, 'pure' DPS class. We respec and guess what, we are still DPS. So stop letting hybrids rival the pure DPS classes for damage done in both PvE and PvP when they have the ability to heal themselves on demand. Noticed an influx of druids and paladins lately? I wonder why...</div></div><hr />

Off topic:<br />
<br />
Some frost tanks may actually want to switch Pestilence for Death Embrace glyph. A Frost DK with glyph of Howling Blast probably never need to use pestilence, if not at all. However, they may use death coil to selfheal (lichborne -&gt; self cast deathcoil macro), in that case the RP refund is quite sweet.</div></div><hr />

The one and only spec that outcasts us from being shadow priests as affliction and fire mages as destruction.<br />
<br />
When metamorphisis was introduced i was quick to respec to demonology and even quicker to switch back to destruction. To try to hit many suggestions to the Q and A's I will start off on interesting changes that myself and just about every warlock would love to see. <br />
<br />
First off the ability to cast green spells. With a full demo build warlocks are restricted to dots and a continous shadow bolt spam. If we look at affliction its noted for Shadow Bolts being its main filler spell while destructions main filler is Incinerate. Why not add a new spell to the demonology tree to act as the filler spell while dpsing. While many locks are apposed to channeled spells over cast timers, I think this would deffinatly define demonology by adding in a brand new channeled filler.<br />
<br />
Second topic i would like to hit off on is the warlock only demon flyer. If metamorphisis became a permanent form (like shadow form for preists) instead of a cool down spell, flight would be possible without the need to model a new mount after all, Illidan could fly as a demon why cant we? A permanent demon form would make demonology a more fun spec to play, of course it would require a nerf to surviability but possibly a buff to damage. Many warlocks ive talked to have seen a pure 700-1000 dps loss when switching to a full demo spec.<br />
<br />
Making demons worth while once again. As a demonologist we are capable of enslaving demons and control demons. why stop there? An interesting spell to be would be demonic fusion. the basic idea behind this spell would be the ability to merge two demons into one super demon of sorts. felhunter/succubus for pvp CC or imp/felgaurd for pve dps. And even going as far as maybe imp/felhunter for a dps/cc combo that can survive raids. Toss in a major glyph where we can merge a 3rd demon? The idea is golden, what other class can successfuly mix and match anything other than what spec they use.<br />
<br />
Removing hellfire from the spell book without replacing it with a similar fast acting AoE spell is very pointless. almost every class has an instant cast AoE of some form which is great for quick bursts while warlocks closest thing is hellfire. 1 second before damage starts is still a benift over the 3 second wait for rain of fire to start ticking or seed of corruption to get cast. I cant even begin to start listing the amount of GM tickets that ive saved myself from having to use with the lifetap/hellfire suicide. While warlocks still remain the only class that can sucessfully kill themselves while standing in one spot it still saves not only ourselves a ton of headaches from glitches in the game but aswell as GMs times to service a ticket. KEEP HELLFIRE PLEASE, if it isnt broke dont fix it. If it isnt strong enough then buff it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When i first had my lock in BC (i never played vanilla) I had no idea what to expect. I started on a PVP realm so I had to learn, fast. What did I learn? everyone (except rogues ofc) feared us, FEAR we have lost that. (no pun intended). We have lost the fear that we struck into our opponents. I remember countless times running through blades edge or netherstorm, I would see a druid or a Warrior, mage or pally and they would just turn and run the other way. Why? we were op, yes, but we were able to survive. The survivability of locks has long since decreased and it hurts, bad. <br />
<br />
I am around 800 Resil and its as if I am wearing toilet paper, i mean seriously.<br />
<br />
Anyways, you guys covered the PvP stuff pretty much, Demonic Circle, Pets, Death Coil + Hellfire and Shadowburn....<br />
<br />
What I did not see in the Q &amp; A was 2 simple words. CHAOS BOLT<br />
<br />
FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT it does NOT do what it says it does and I demand it to be able to break Ice Block, Bubble, and anything else that gets in the way. If i want to fire it at a baby's head I should be able to. For christs sake, if we were able to do that it would give us an edge and make our opponent be it a pally or a mage think twice about bubbling or ice blocking, ya hear? Chaos Bolt sucks, truly, it is the worst 51st point talent since, Metamorphasis, ok no really, I do not want to compare to mages but they got FROSTFIRE BOLT at 80 and when they spec into ARCANE BARRAGE!<br />
<br />
what do we get? A re skinned shadowbolt with dots, WOO HOO! Fix that talent, fix the damage and fix the god damn effect PLEASE!<br />
<br />
As for shards, I don't mind collecting them like souvenirs, but seriously, take it out of shadowburn, its useless and dumb and does not need to be there. This is what I assume the convo was like between GC and The dev's before the Q&amp;A<br />
<br />
GC: So what should I tell the public<br />
Dev: Tell them what we know<br />
GC: So everything?<br />
Dev: No, uh..just beat around the bush till it sounds right, make stuff up if you have to<br />
GC: Now your speaking my language!<br />
<br />
so ya, PvP surviv is a bitch, PvE is lame when I am getting beat by Dk's, Ferals and in some cases Spriests (rarely), Pure DPS &gt; Hybrids ALWAYS no matter WHAT<br />
<br />
as for the flying mount, I say a Cerberus or Pit Lord like thing, Maybe we just train &quot;Demon Form Flying&quot; and we can just transform like a druid? I like that<br />
<br />
I don't think I missed anything.......bah....so much work to be done</div></div><hr />

<br />
What the Warlock needs is new models for their old crappy demons, just like Druids got.<br />
<br />
<br />
Make Voidwalker cool and make him have an Absorb + Deflect spell.<br />
Out with Succubus, in with Incubus! The Incubus will be like the personal rogue slave of the Warlock. Acting in stealth, plus having a few Rogue abilities, like Cheap Shot and Shadowy Ambush. His damage is Shadow instead of Physical.<br />
Remove Felhunter, replace with Cerberus. 3-headed demon beast with bleed effects and 3 lives! (One for each head).<br />
Remove the annoying Imp and replace him with a Moloch, a demon that casts various fire spells.<br />
Add a new über pet - the Pit Lord! He's the ultimate demon with wicked attacks!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
cause that wouldnt be overpowered... stun fear demon with 3 lives.... we and our demons have survivability issues imo but having a demon with 3 lives is insanely overpowered, I would say having a Pit Lord would have some balancing issues also</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think I made some good pointers Sad<br />
<br />
hehe, I think because you didn't stick big quotes up people scanned over it :)<br />
<br />
But yeah fair point, Enslave demons is pretty useless along with eye of kilrogg, I don't think i've used it at all other than when I was bored.<br />
<br />
We do need a cool new enchant thats fair. Mongoose, Executioner, Crusader, Life Stealing, Blade Warding, Berserking just a few of the top enchants over the years.. all melee. The melee can also have straight strength, agility or even just plain old weapon damage.<br />
<br />
All we get is spell power these days. Intellect and spirit wouldn't be worth it unless it was an incredible amount, something silly like 200. A proc haste or proc critical strike would be nice actually.<br />
You know, maybe even a PvP weapon enchant. Proc resilience or proc stamina/armor on spell cast or melee swing. Still, this is getting a little off the topic of warlocks :)<br />
Blizzard have mentioned over and over that they 'intend' to buff our pets and never do, and yes it seems very seperated that we cannot name our own pet. Tier 9 set bonuses are looking a touch lame as well i know.<br />
Rolling on cloth items does annoy me, but if you are in a decent guild the raid leader and master looter should give priority to clothies as we have to roll against so many classes for our items. Rings, trinkets, necks and weapons are spread across so many classes... hands off the cloth!<br />
And yes, Wildi has some good points indeed.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about how Blizzard mention they want to place more mechanics around our shard system.<br />
Maybe we could use them as a defensive tool as well. <br />
<br />
A few ideas:<br />
A shard shield a bit like a bone shield, you split a soul shard into 4 pieces which revolve around the warlock absorbing attacks. One attack for each piece. Of course with the speed rogues attack it wuldn't do much. however, perhaps these shards could evern absord their initial cheap shot.<br />
<br />
Shard explosion: A bit like the elemental Shamans pillar knockback. that would get melee off us for a few seconds and make us more useful in PvP right? Especially arena?<br />
<br />
or perhaps we could use the shard a bit more like Dispersion or Iceblock. It incases us in darkness surrounded by the soul of another absorbing all damage or a large portion of x amount of time.<br />
<br />
Failing that, give Fel or Demon armor a chance to remove a poison/DoT/Slowing effect once every 3-5 seconds and leave us immune to it being re-applied for 1 or 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
You cannot continue to have classes unable to escape and be locked down throughout fights. priests, Shamans and Warlocks can't get away. we need help in this area.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">afflicted</div><div class="date">2009-07-03, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">they could make hellfire like arcane explosion something that is an instant cast (only 1 tick of the hellfire per cast of course) and decrease the amount of health it consumes for the cast</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like your comment before, the things you say now are also ACE. And i REALLY like your soulshard ideas! especialy the bone armor variant. <br />
<br />
I just keeps asking myself why simpleminded people like us make REALLY good ideas on how to fix a somewhat broken class while 1000's of well payed blizzard people have no idea what to do</div></div><hr />

<br />
- See stealth (Rogues)<br />
- Heal their Pet with one button (Hunter)<br />
- Make your teleporter more usefull like Blink (Mage)<br />
- a poison immunity (Pally/Priest/Druid)<br />
- Shard explosion: A bit like the elemental Shamans pillar knockback. (Shaman)<br />
- and more DPS<br />
<br />
On top of the stats going to your pets and Resil not affecting dots anymore. It sounds to me that Locks biggest problems are rogues ATM. Maybe instead of giving you the talents of every other class, maybe blizz should think about looking at rogues as a whole. Or maybe they are just the one class you aren't meant to faceroll. Besides if blizzard gave you guys all the stuff above, wouldn't that make you more OP then you already are?</div></div><hr />

<br />
blizzard should lower the instance reset limit. ie: you can only enter two instances per hour instead of the 5 they have now.<br />
<br />

<br />
Obviously you are not a warlock mate, but yeah, perhaps you are right, they do need to look at rogues... or more so the talent of deadly brew in Assassination.<br />
<br />
We don't want everything on the list, That would be absolutely ridiculous. these are just ideas we are giving Blizzard, we are voicing our opinions on the weaker sides of our class.<br />
<br />
being able to see rogues in stealth was something Warlocks could do throughout Vanilla and TBC and was suddenly taken away. It wasn't like we could see them a mile off either, we only could if the rogue was clumsy and walked in front of us.<br />
We still have the buff to an extent, its just been moved to our voidwalker and can't be used while we are in combat or without locking our pet and consuming shadows.<br />
<br />
Besides, look at how many other classes have abilities which cover others.<br />
<br />
Druid, Stealth, initial stealth pounce stun,sprint, gauge and another combo point stun :rogue abilities<br />
Feral charge, rage regeneration, bash stun, pounce: pretty much a concussion blowing, charging, intercepting enraged generating warrior<br />
Cyclone, typhoon, tree ents, roots: very much like a half shaman half mage.<br />
faerie fire : like a hunters mark and a sunder in one<br />
And oh yes, they can also heal themselves, break any CC with a shapeshift, avoid saps by being a tree, innervate themselves and of course kill someone through thorns while they kite you around with hot which cannot be dispelled or purged without healing them for prety much the full amount.<br />
<br />
this is only druids i've touched on here mate.<br />
<br />
Every class should have a nemesis there is no doubt, BUT, a skilled player should still be able to give that class a run for their money and even win without requiring help from another.<br />
I will admit, a Paladin and most of the time a mage will have very little chance vs a warlock in a 1v1 situation. Paladins are just far to easily feared.<br />
However, at elast they have a chance to fight back.<br />
A rogue gets the jump on everyone no matter what, unless your a human (or anotehr rogue)and possibly see them first. This means they are already well in control of the fight.<br />
Difference is, a warlock has no defense vs this, we MUST trinket one of the stuns, best is usually the 5 point Kidney shot. if you trinket the cheap shot you tend to get hit by the kidney immediately.<br />
Then you must either, hope you placed the Demonic circle earlier, hope he doesn't cloak of shadows to absorb your death coil or instant howl, hope you have a succubus out to seduce him OR hope he's just a very poor rogue. there are far too many hopes in there.<br />
paladin bubbles<br />
mage blinks or iceblocks<br />
Priest - tends to die lets be fair as well<br />
Shaman: elemental has a chance, enh or resto tends to die<br />
Warrior second wind, enraged regen, bladestorm dead rogue.. prot laughs at him.<br />
Death knights tends to laugh no matter the spec as well<br />
Druid, shapeshifts, abolish poison and kites in bear.<br />
hunter, disengage, feigns death to drop target, deflection, traps, hunters mark, flare etc etc<br />
rogue - tries to outsmart him. if he's caught he's dead - but thats his own class.<br />
<br />
My point is, yes, you are right, rogues need to be looked at. perhaps this is why they are taking 2v2 out of the picture in terms of items in the next patch. 2v2 is their real strength.<br />
Rogues have never been about a sustained fight, they need to be in and out or they are then at a disadvantage to most. However even if we withstand the initial assualt, three forms of poison lock us down.</div></div><hr />
