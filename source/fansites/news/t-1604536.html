<br />
Warlords of Draenor Beta - Darker Nights<br />
It looks like the Darker Nights we looked at previously (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4154-Warlords-of-Draenor-Darker-Nights-Gaze-of-the-Black-Prince-Returns-Blue-Tweets) may not be coming to every zone, just some that were too bright at night.<br />

<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Beta - Build 18996<br />
This smallest beta build we have seen so far is here!<br />
<br />
Spell Changes<br />
Item Set Bonuses<br />
<br />
Item - Warlock T17 Demonology 2P Bonus (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/165451/#18988-18996) Hand of Gul'dan now has 1 additional maximum charge, and Corruption has a 4% 2% chance to generate 1 charge of Hand of Gul'dan when dealing damage.<br />
<br />

Major Glyphs<br />
<br />
Glyph of Immediate Truth (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/56416/#18988-18996) Increases the instant damage done by Seal of Truth by 40% 30%, but decreases the damage done by Censure by 50%. Major Glyph.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid &amp; Dungeon Abilities<br />
<br />
Burning Breath (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/166041/#18988-18996) Breaths a wide line of fire, inflicting 23,750 to 26,250 19,000 to 21,000 Fire Damage. 40 yd range. Instant.<br />
Deafening Screech (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/143343/#18988-18996) Inflicts 250,000 Inflicts 200,000 Physical damage to all enemies and interrupts spellcasting for 2 sec. 100 Mana. 0.7 sec cast. 1.5 sec cooldown.<br />
Imbued Iron Axe (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/162097/#18988-18996) Throws a whirling axe, inflicting 38,000 to 42,000 28,500 to 31,500 Fire damage to nearby enemies. Unlimited range. Instant.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
There will always be a 'best'. it can be close though.<br />
This. If the difference between 2H and DW is a dozen stat points, that's fine. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/517736267136528385))<br />
<br />
what's the deal with glyphs? Mages have 24 while others have 30+ / 40+! That's sad to know. =/ #warcraft<br />
Mage: 21M/9m, Hunt: 25/11, Rog: 24/13, a lot of mage glyphs were baked into class recently though, suggests? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/517796654338945024))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k))<br />
regarding Warlocks: Sims are showing Shadowburn as a DPS loss due to the removal of the mana return. Does this concern you?<br />
Of course, but that doesn't match what we're seeing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/517495593799655424))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Will Herald of the Titans be removed in 6.0?<br />
Nope, should still be available and in the same general tuning ballpark. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/517503331993137152))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
some confusion about if there can be multiple Ashran instances available to a single server <br />
Each realm only points to one Ashran but multiple realms may point to the same Ashran. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517475920194437120))<br />
will the 100 per faction cap potentially be raised if servers like Illidan/Sargeras end up with long Ashran queue times?<br />
We'll raise it as high as the game can handle (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517483187187236864))<br />
<br />
Will there be a base honor prize per win or just all strong box? currently on beta I've won 20+ skirms and earned 349 honor <br />
There will be small honor prize per win. But you can expect skirmishes to be fairly inefficient at first. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517737616087605248))<br />
<br />
Is there an honor wipe at launch?<br />
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517781180696260608))<br />
<br />
Will the 2.2k enchants (Bloody Dancing Steel, Spirit of Conquest... etc.) still be available for purchase in WoD?<br />
The visual will be a part of the Enchanter's Study in the Garrisons. It will still have a rating requirement. I believe it's 2400 (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/517796958694408192))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Horde do get off easy. Wage war and suffer no lasting damage. weird dichotomy compared how it played out Ally<br />
Disagree. Lots of Horde casualties; Darkspear rebels, Org civilians, vendors and trainers on spikes in SoO. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517500648707743744))<br />
<br />
But again, the Horde only started losing because Garrosh turned on itself, not because of Alliance action.<br />
How so? Alliance players raid Orgrimmar just the same. Fictionally, any raid who defeats SoO is responsible. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517501807841402881))<br />
<br />
I think it's more monotony: Horde acts, Alliance reacts, Horde implodes due to plot device, Alliance wins by passivity<br />
Operation Shieldwall not passive. Anduin chasing the Divine Bell not passive. SoO not passive. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517501006288941056))<br />
Wrathion himself concludes as much at the end.<br />
I don't think musing over Garrosh unraveling the Horde is meant to diminish the Alliance's impact on fighting him (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/517501996769619968))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
I believe it is, just the Bunker will not increase the chance of upgraded follower chance from quests rewards.<br />
They still have the chance to be upgraded, it's just not increased by the building. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/517752515136221184))<br />
<br />
Kinda wish this wasn't the case so it didn't force those buildings on us. Choice with Garrisons seems nonexistent.<br />
At a point, you will have made all of the things you want, and you can't sell the soulbound reagents, so swap! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/517752800613134336))<br />

^^This. I'm disappointed to hear this, as well. I'm also hoping that they will continue to add night time lighting to more areas. All areas with night time lighting (day/night cycles) equals immersion at its best. We used to have day/night years ago until Cata expac... they removed night lighting :(<br />
<br />
I am delighted that night time is being brought back, but PLEASE add it to the entire WoW world, even if it's just a few areas at a time. It'd be much appreciated by a LOT of peeps :)</div></div><hr />

That glyph has a possibility to be a very viable one. Depending on how high your multistrike would be. This nerf isnt a bad change on there part they mustve found that it was in fact doing more damage on some parts that SoT.</div></div><hr />

The game is so freaking bad. Blizzard apparently has no idea what makes dota-style games fun to begin with, and ended up removing most of that stuff in order to simplify and casualize the genre. It's just going to annoy current fans of the moba genre and any new potential players who try it (because it's a blizzard game) will be quickly bored.<br />
<br />
It should have stayed as a simple Starcraft 2 mod like originally planned.</div></div><hr />

Darker nights was supposed to be in for 5.4. I remember trade chat blowing up on the first night wondering where the hell the darkness was. They then said they'd do it for WoD. So actually they broke their promise twice now.</div></div><hr />

Personally I was really looking forward to darker nights, and from what they showed they really meant to go far with it too. Shame that only a handful of zones will be actually darker at night. I wonder if WoD zones are dark at night.</div></div><hr />

If I had to guess, it would be because they would need to go back and add more lights (e.g. street lamps, torches) to compensate for the darker nights. <br />
<br />
WoW used to have dark nights in vanilla, but some players complain that it's too dark and they can't see anything. So Blizzard just increase the ambient light.<br />
<br />
Adding more lights using the current engine would be a bad idea as it would negatively impact the framerate - the more light sources, the slower forward rendering gets. But with the new deferred rendering engine, they can have as many lights as they want with little to no impact on performance.</div></div><hr />

It was hyped up here and on the fan sites. Not really Blizzard's fault, nor do I really blame people for being upset, considering this has been a wanted feature for some time. <br />
<br />
I too was hoping for a graphics slider/toggle in the UI, it's indeed disappointing although it's not in my list of top 5 disappointments regarding removed/only partially implemented features in WoD currently. <br />

They should start using less &quot;hope&quot; in their wordings. It's getting tedious by now. How many people work on World of Warcraft again, doubt any developer in the industry has that many people on a single game as they do and they take months or even years for the most basic features - it's becoming a pattern for blizzard to hold back features just so they can present them when they need them to please the public. A toy/tabard storage was demanded for about 6 years now, and they present on part of it now magially to please the people, on the other hand they cut 50% of what has been said on the WoD pannel at Blizzcon. Introduce a demanded feature by the players, to lessen the negative impact of us cutting other stuff - marketing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everquest in 1999 made heavy use of light sources, both in the environment and on players/spell effects. The game had very dark nights (way darker than vanilla wow, even) and light sources were almost a requirement to adventure in the dark places of the world. I'm pretty sure if peoples video cards could handle that back in the 90's, we would be okay in 2014 with a game that has some light sources lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've made it clear the light levels can be adjusted in all of the zones, it doesn't even have to be disputed or argued. It just urks me because when all is said and done I can't help but percieve it as &quot;Can't be bothered, too much effort.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, just another lazy solution. It seems that Blizzard focuses more on crap things like farmerama, pokemon and other things that were never demaded by players (like another cat form for druids), but never try to make the actual game better. A part of it would be to bring back dark nights. I mean, that's what nights tend to be - dark, and not bright. Would also help to improve immersion into the game.</div></div><hr />

How many actually cast light?<br />

Look at all the glowing weapons in WoW, apart from some vanilla items like Staff of Hale Magefire, none of them light up the surrounding area. They just &quot;glow&quot;. i.e. they aren't light sources.</div></div><hr />

We used to have day/night years ago until Cata expac... they removed night lighting :(<br />
<br />
I am delighted that night time is being brought back, but PLEASE add it to the entire WoW world, even if it's just a few areas at a time. It'd be much appreciated by a LOT of peeps :)<br />
<br />
There can be such a thing as too much immersion. Some people who are on the same time zone as their server may only get to play at night, and constant play darkness is not really much fun. Not to mention, heavier darkness makes things like farming, avoiding mobs, etc. slightly harder to do. I think Blizz got this one right.</div></div><hr />

Shouldn't have included anything even resembling an ETA, even with the qualifier &quot;we're hoping&quot;. A simple &quot;We're working on it&quot;, followed by status updates (hat still never, ever gave an ETA) would have been just fine.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to be more frank like they were with the character model updates. If you give a big feature any sort of release date at all, make it absolutely clear from the outset that it's a big undertaking and that it likely won't be 100% complete when it's first implemented.</div></div><hr />

Let's be intelligent here. There is a new expansion pack coming. It's a little lackluster. It just is, accept it. Now think, many people will come back for this expansion despite it not -really- being as cool as we expected. If you played in vanilla onwards, you will remember the patch notes being like the Magna Carta, the Dead Sea Scrolls, they were *religious* doctrinations of YAAAAy. This hasn't happening in long time.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Let's forward wind. Many people come back. The expansion, they like. It's nice to be back for those that decided MOP was terrible after meh Cata. They approach the end of the month of WOD. Unsure if continue. Patch notes are out. Black nights. Flight (I will quit if this happens, but it will). New Raid (a massive one) etc.. this is why you should not expect Dark nights (like days of ye olde) to be a feature, it's never going to be a 'oh and by the way' - it's going to be a patch notes, 'guys you need to come and see this' feature.</div></div><hr />

You are reduced to making an argument about language in an attempt to defend Blizzard. Yup, Ill colour you a fanboy. <br />
<br />
It really dosen't matter that they didn't put &quot;we promise&quot; in front of every statement. They haven't promised the expansion will be out either but you'd be pissed off if you didn't get your copy on the announced release date. Oh but then you wouldn't you just say they didn't promise anything.<br />
<br />
So what you're saying is that you don't understand the difference between a release date and 'we hope to have something by then'.</div></div><hr />

That would feel a bit trippy after a while.<br />

Actually those are the numbers used by FFXIV, feels pretty natural when I was playing it.</div></div><hr />

Really? Cool. I just figured it would be weird in a &quot;I've been playing for two hours and now it's tomorrow&quot; kinda wa.</div></div><hr />

Take your semantics and shove them up your ass.</div></div><hr />

Well...yes. When the argument is: You're saying &quot;They said X&quot;, when in fact they didn't, there is no other way to argue about it other than presenting evidence that they did or didn't and the language used. How else do you expect to argue over it, pet battles?<br />
<br />
They either said something or they didn't, of course it comes down to arguing over what they said. Actually, an argument would require merits of both sides, which isn't the case here. They didn't promise darker nights, end of story. Again, hope does not mean the same as promise. No argument in the world should hinge on them meaning or being interpreted as the same thing, unless you don't know the meaning of them in the first place, or you're just being obtuse for the sake of it. <br />
<br />
And no, a release date is a promise. It's saying you will have this content on this date. It's a very definite promise. It has the conditions of an arrival date attatched. Dark nights was just &quot;hope to get it out by 6.0&quot; not &quot;WILL BE&quot;, not &quot;IS COMING&quot;, not &quot;DARK NIGHTS 4/11/2014 prepare your torches!&quot; and definitely not &quot;We PROMISE dark nights for 6.0&quot; Just &quot;hope to get it out by 6.0&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;We hope to get it to you by wednesday&quot; is not the same as &quot;You will have it by wednesday 13/11/2014&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The fanboy is strong in this one. So you say they didn't actually say the word &quot;promise&quot; so that means it's not a promise. Then you go on to say they didn't say the word &quot;promise&quot; for release date, ie &quot;we promise it will come out on this date&quot; but that somehow in magic fanboy make believe land equates to a promise. So which is it? When it suits your agenda? Release dates can be pushed back. I fucking guarantee you if the expansion gets delayed you'll be the first fanboy in line to defend them stating they never promised that was the release date.<br />

When a friend tells me he is going to meet me for coffee and doesn't show I don't give two shits if his wording was promise or hope. To me it's flaky and if the behavior continues I find a new friend. Only difference here is my friend doesn't have a gaggle of mindless white knights following him around defending him to his death.</div></div><hr />
