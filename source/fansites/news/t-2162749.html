PTR Testing Update: Class Campaigns<br />
We've resolved an issue with the PTR that was preventing Class Campaigns from showing up. You should now be able to proceed with testing them.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/796785-ptr-testing-update-class-campaigns/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753196156?page=1#1))<br />

Order Hall sets: what a WASTE<br />
By the time 7.2 comes out ilvl 860 will be worthless as well. Admit it, it was another poor design choice and implemented terribly<br />
You (and other individual players) are not representative of every one of the players in this game. For you, sure, this may not be helpful at all - but for some people, this will be a good way to boost a couple of slots, and that's where the intent for this lies.<br />
<br />
Again, this is not an intended answer for every avenue of play style.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
I appreciate the feedback on this update, everyone. Again, I'll ask about the gating and see what we plan to do about addressing it.<br />
<br />
Ornyx,<br />
<br />
from your replies, it's apparent you're missing the point here. The order hall sets are mostly useless by time you get them. When I dinged 110 was getting 805 WQ gear. By time I rand a few heroics and thus got better WQ gear, the few 820 pieces were outclassed. <br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong it was nice to grab some 820s as I hit 110 etc. but their useful life was VERY VERY short. Once you start getting 835 WQ gear, the OH gear isn't useful. So, we have a situation where you can't use these pieces to help leveling and you can only really benefit from the for a week or two after hitting 110. <br />
<br />
Having them be 860 will be nice, but again, for those of us playing now we'll likely have almost everything at 860 anyway and for newly dinged toons it might be too much bother to do everything needed to get the 860 versions vs simply playing the game and getting gear the normal way.<br />
I don't think I'm missing the point. I understand people think the gear is useless because they out level it compared to the curve you have to climb to get the gear.<br />
<br />
I'm just saying that there are cases that this gear will be useful, and if you have a few slots open that match the pieces you have, that are sub-860, then great, you have a use for it. 860 is not instantly obsolete gear unless you're raiding. It's on level with Nighthold raidfinder, which seems fine as an introductory step.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I'm going to ask about the gating. If that comes down at all, then I could see this being more widely useful.<br />
<br />
Just dinged 110 on a new toon the other day and would have loved having those 860 tokens. The AH is expensive, LOL. Wanna level a new toon, but 7.2 is so far away. Wish those tokens came in a minipatch or whatever. Anyway good change for me. <br />
<br />
((I just do WQ, LFR and Reg Mythics, btw.<br />
<br />
~~<br />
<br />
Who are these people LOL . Even the most casual player, of which I am, has no need for this gear. It was poorly designed and poorly implemented. The cost of upgrading the gear is just not worth it . FFace it it was a really bad decision , one of many in the last 3 expansions<br />
You submitted that just before me. I am fine with the gear. Like i said, i just do lower level stuff. When I do mythics, I often make my own groups which are usually lower ilvl people.<br />
Yep. The target for something like this is not players who are raiding, doing high-end mythics, etc. Casual players who are just world questing, came in late to the game, etc. can see some use from this.<br />
<br />
Glad you understand this - wish we could get 'em to you sooner! ;P<br />
<br />
I don't even do mythics (or heroics) and I generally replace all of the easily unlocked pieces of this set within a few days of played time at max level.<br />
In the current environment, sure. The point here is the 860 tokens coming next patch. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/796543-order-hall-sets-what-a-waste/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752955105?page=10#185))<br />

Class Mounts<br />
Are we going to need Pathfinder to get our class mounts or will we be able to ride them as ground mounts? <br />
Legion Pathfinder is not required to earn the 7.2 Class Mounts, no. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/825127660124676096))<br />

Artifact Power in Patch 7.2<br />
Am I wasting my time farming AP for my weapon: will taking the empowerment at 54 traits yield MORE benefit than at, say, 36?<br />
You'll have more AP refunded, so you'll be able to buy more of the new traits immediately. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/825128780897267713))<br />
<br />
What will happen the passive bonus we got from having the &quot;Paragon Trait&quot; maxed? We will we lose it?<br />
Yes, but there'll be a flat increase to the Artifact's power as part of that process. Between that and new traits, it'll be a clear upgrade.(WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/825133132986740737))<br />

<br />
it would be acceptable if blue specifically says the class hall set is strictly for transmog purposes only, but from the blue post is just shows how disconnected the devs are with the game, its like they dont even play the game at all<br />
<br />
&quot; 860 will keep you afloat, and should be acceptable to get into normal modes for most 7.0-7.1.5 raids, with a bit of a bump needed for something like normal Nighthold.&quot;<br />
<br />
860 ilvl wont even get u in normal mythic dungeons, these wonderful looking sets obviously fails to serve the purpose the devs created them for , to keep players afloat n join 7.0-7.1.5 raids. <br />

<br />
Of course you would prefer the Class Hall Sets being 920 ilvl. But then you would complain when 890+ people suck in your MM+15 PUG.<br />
<br />
You will aim for the Set bonuses on low-ilvl alts or to ease the expeditions (dunno if their bonus are fine for one class, I never really cared). You will aim for one particular piece if you're being unlucky regarding one item slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean the MAJORITY of players, the amount of players who actually visit forums to discuss/complain about changes are MINIMAL. I know it feels like we have a vast amount of players who visit the forums to discuss things but the truth is there's much more who don't. You're part of the minority, Blizzard need to cater to all players.<br />
<br />
Also if you think using the order hall sets are efficient and optimal you're playing the game wrong. You didn't even need to equip more than 1/3 of them before Mythic+ was released, if you had the full set you're actually not playing efficiently in the slightest.<br />
<br />
Also there's ALWAYS been gear in the game that becomes outdated over time, literally in every expansion there's been gear that's gated behind rep that falls off after the first tier and is forgotten on the vendor. Also FYI there's LOTS of other MMO's that have the same system, Wildstar, Guild Wars 2 , Tera Online, etc etc... Just because the items aren't useful anymore doesn't mean it's &quot;bad design&quot;, it just means they served their purpose in the expansion and there will be better gear that's obtainable otherwise.<br />
<br />
Get the fuck over yourselves, how entitled can you possibly be. Stop looking for issues and try to enjoy the game, you're literally calling Blizzard out on the lamest points, it's like you haven't played a MMO before.</div></div><hr />

Worng, how come anybody's alt can hit Revered or Exalted reputation to buy a piece, right after having reached 110. That's why it is only good for transmogs.<br />
<br />
From my experience with some alts, it happend that the same day I had got a head piece and upgraded its item level to 830, I happened to get 840 ilev head. That was when I stopped bothering with buying and upgrading the order hall set pieces on alts. I still value the whole set for transmog on my pala main :)</div></div><hr />

Now, if having a system that can benefit some people and be -obsolete- for those who have more time to play and put some effort on their gear, why not have it? It's a pointless argument really.<br />
It's better to have more options that benefit a variety of people even if &quot;The majority&quot; has no use for it, than remove something because it doesn't fir someone who posts angrily on the forums.</div></div><hr />

I did the same thing on my main, upgraded a OH piece that was replaced the same day by a WQ TF roll. Wasted a bunch of resources which set me back a bit on the OH upgrades, which i should have prioritized over a 830 helm.<br />

Tho none of this is different from any of the vendor gear in this xpac. By the time you can purchase it, you have absolutely no use for it other than alts, who cant buy it till they get the rep up too, and subsequently, dont need it anymore.</div></div><hr />

Back when I was a fresh 110 on my main, I got the set upgraded gradually as i attained pieces because it seemed like a cool one, however continously gear from world quests would beat it out for me in ilevel even before I got everything except the helm (which i used for 1 day). I mean, not even group content which i assume this set is not really trying to compete with, but actual solo play beat it out. That simply tells us that the pacing to get this set is too badly implemented.</div></div><hr />

Right now even a char that has never seen a mythic dungeon from the inside, and has gear only from doing world quests (like my warrior for example: http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/blackhand/Vadash/simple who is not even halfway to exalted with Nightfallen), won't need them or the upgrade is not worth it anymore when you have completed the requirements to obtain the items.</div></div><hr />

The set bonuses clearly imply that the set's intention is to make open world content easier. The set really adds no benefit to m+ or raiding environments. And imo, it shouldn't. It's there when you hit max level to get some gear for doing relatively simple things. The outlier being the shoulders, which you don't need if you have the rest of the set anyway.

The set simply isn't good enough to be gated as it is. You should be buying pieces of it AS you get to 110 (with the last one as you ding), or be able to get ALL of it at 110 in a couple of days. Between WQs and dungeons (not even mythics, even heroics) it just is rendered obsolete so quickly. Exalted with Nightfallen? Revered with multiple reps? Get out of here with that crap. lol<br />

Gotta agree: bad design.<br />

They are really driving home the point that casual player really find this set useful. I find that incredibly difficult to believe, to the point I have no problems saying that it is a lie. It is crytsal clear this stuff is useless but they insist the opposite. So disconnected from the community its sad.<br />

Making a calculation based off of parjesh's health on mythic+0 and on mythic+24, it looks like it's about 585% of base health and damage. Then, in addition, the trash has an extra 40% damage and 20% health, so the trash packs are doing 820% damage and have 700% health.<br />

<br />
Other than that the only reason is transmog, which if you do your emissary quests you will have the shoulders in due time anyway.<br />
<br />
The shoulders and a few other parts, like revered with 2 factions. Remember that you only get rep from WQs.<br />
<br />
By the time you get it, you'll have things way better than those just from the WQs/Emissary boxes. And they will acomplish the same objective (or even better) of making open world content easier.<br />
<br />
The set is far from &quot;introductory&quot;. They should never be anything more than honored/class hall quest line/all the dungeons you could do while leveling. They're not meant to be a reward from your full commitment (like they're now). Blizzard seems really lost at their own game since the requirements for the set means you'll get better stuff. If you take into account the amount of resources to upgrade to 840 at least the pieces you would use for the full set bonus, it's even worse.<br />
<br />
My last alt at 110, I had to try really hard to get the set while it was still worth. And failed since I could get 835+ from WQs, 835+ from Emissary caches, 860 from WBs (which is a WQ btw) and the normal/warforged/titanforged gear from the dungeons (to meet one of the requirements) while trying the requirements. It's really weird to ask people to do dungeons when they say that the set is for someone who does not step into dungeons after hitting 110, only doing WQs and being really casual (would take some time to get that one behind the AP requirement).<br />
<br />
If, instead of the 800 pieces for each PoC we take back to Dalaran, we got the set pieces, (finishing the zone + the main quest), with the helm (or even shoulders) being the reward to finish the class hall quest at 110. All of which, at 110, I could upgrade to 810/820/830/840 with the resources, with maybe the 810/820 coming from some kind of emissary token (from the caches), that would be really good design for what they say they want to achieve. The current one is really bad at it's intended purpose.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing I do when I login to one of my alts is do emissary and nightfallen WQs, I have still yet to find a shoulder piece that is 850 and I am fine with that. I don't plan on doing dungeons or raids on that toon. I'm halfway through revered on that toon, and the shoulders will be an upgrade most likely.<br />
<br />
This is one of the purposes of class order hall sets. There are people, like myself, who simply enjoy doing outdoor content, and not dungeons/raids/pvp anymore.<br />
<br />
Man, sorry, but it's really hard to believe that after so much time (it takes some time to reach exalted with Nightfallen at extreme casual play as you say), you didn't get a similar shoulder. Way too many chances for the warforged system to proc.<br />

Does his point stand? Does he indeed have a &quot;solid&quot; argument? He insists that every part of gear should be available when HE thinks it helps him. Blizzard replies &quot;it is not the intention&quot;.<br />
<br />
Would you understand it if they said &quot;Yes, class Hall shoulders will often just be interesting for a transmog completionists and we are fully OK with it&quot;<br />
<br />
Sure, it leaves your opinion of &quot;badly implemented&quot; and I would share that sentiment. Especially as long as this rep is not account wide. But at the end of the day it is a design choice you disagree with. Doesn't make it a solid argument.<br />
<br />
And I don't even see where you could interpret Blizzard supports &quot; support players that herp derps and doesnt know how to gear up efficiently and optimally&quot;?<br />
<br />
You hit 110, you do dungeons and raids and WQs, you get better gear right away. What does it matter that you will be skipping the Class Hall shoulders?<br />
<br />
Actually almost the entire set. The shoulders would be the hardest ones to skip that fast (because of their ilvl), but the rest that you would need to spend a ton of resources to even compete with the rewards from the content they're designed for?<br />
<br />
The argument is solid because Blizzard in the end says that it is for people that don't do anything other than WQs and it's an &quot;introductory&quot; set. The design fails at both since WQs rewards better gear without the gating/resources and something introductory, we would need as a starting point, not at a middle/end point.</div></div><hr />

&quot; 860 will keep you afloat, and should be acceptable to get into normal modes for most 7.0-7.1.5 raids, with a bit of a bump needed for something like normal Nighthold.&quot;<br />

860 ilvl wont even get u in normal mythic dungeons, these wonderful looking sets obviously fails to serve the purpose the devs created them for , to keep players afloat n join 7.0-7.1.5 raids. <br />
<br />
So yes, the guy has a rock solid argument and his point stands because of the blue responses.<br />

Nah, to me that is just cherry picking one part of the blue response. What about &quot;Again, this is not an intended answer for every avenue of play style.&quot; and that he is going to ask the devs if this gating is intended.<br />
<br />
BTW, that is from somebody who is annoyed by an &quot;exhalted Nightfallen&quot; gating as well. But at least I am honest enough to admit to myself that at the end of the day it is the transmog look that I like from the shoulders because WQs have long supplied me with better shoulders</div></div><hr />

Justice gear was largely worthwhile due to fast obtainment of them and lack of options available outside of the RNG of the dungeon grind that equivalent gear came from. By mid WotLK justice gear quickly became crap to fill that green from leveling that would get replaced with raid level badge gear.

The set itself is gated behind a quest chain. For most people, once you complete that quest chain you have multiple better peices from random dungeons or WQ's. They can say all they like that the audience is different, thats fine. The audience is literally noone at this point.<br />
<br />
Even at 860, youll be outgrowing them by the time you finish the class hall campaign due to the content in 7.2.<br />
