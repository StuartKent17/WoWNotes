<br />
These are the tactics that Paragon used on their first Lich King kill 26.3.2010. That week we had the 5% increased healing/health/damage buff active. Patch 3.3.3 had come out on previous Wednesday. The patch provided dps buffs to some classes (like frost death knight and moonkin) as well as it buffed priest shields and gave the 5% damage bonus to pets.<br />
<br />
Basic stats on the encounter:<br />
Lich King: 103,9M hitpoints (dies at 10%)<br />
Val’kyr Shadowguards: 3M hitpoints<br />
Raging Spirits: 4,1M hitpoints<br />
Vile Spirits: (blew these up)<br />
<br />
The fight has 3 different phases and 2 transition phases + Frostmourne room in the last phase.<br />

The video will be out once some other guild kills it - you posting something on forums that has been debunked, trashed and totally destroyed in every possible way doesn't accomplish on putting any pressure on us whatsoever to release it earlier than intended. 8]<br />
<br />
I remember For the Horde killing LK25 on heroic as the second guild around 21:58 on 10.04.2010 or 11.04.2010 - can't remember which day it was exactly. Once they did, the video of Paragon's kill was out immediately on WCM and Youtube within like 5 minutes. It's a bit long story to explain and involves the Large Hadron Collider actually working properly back in 2016. It has started to become a bit of a haze and I'm not supposed to talk about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
date of that post: 10th of april<br />
this blows my mind, but im happy the Collider works tho.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing hes referring to cancel aura macros. But its in no way a glitch. That would be like saying killing a raid member on the orig BQL was a glitch.</div></div><hr />

I guess the &quot;Realm First: Fall of the Lich King&quot; achievement at the end doesn't indicate a first kill.<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, they aren't silenced yet. As we can see, some people are now clinging hopelessly to the possibility that Ensidia, will get a buffless kill.<br />
<br />
Sucks balls. I want people to shut up and give Paragon, FtH and even Ensidia respect too, but nope, some people just can't.</div></div><hr />

A guy with a weird voice. There are no women on the internet (i.e. in wow).<br />
<br />
I never get enough of the ending of this expansion. The whole &quot;rp-part&quot; at the end is so epic, despite what all the haters say.<br />
Also I find it great that you always hear the nerdscreams of the last percent on those recent first kill videos ;D<br />
Great job from paragon (and for the horde!) on the kill. Again despite what all the haters say, not every guild will be able to do it (even with the video I doubt we will see dozens of kills now)</div></div><hr />

Damn i forgot about that. Those people should really just give it up. With several guilds killing him with the buff, the gear he drops will forever taint the buffless kill in their minds. What they don't realize is NO guild will take him down without the buff before they take him down with the buff. So once again it will be one of the first guilds that kills him with the 5%, if anyone. Honestly i don't see any of the top guilds wasting their time with it.</div></div><hr />

&quot;We finally managed to kill Lich King on heroic difficulty,even though it took us so long we don't really think it's that hard as other people claim.Mimiron hardmode was much harder!&quot;<br />

You guys DID see that they hit the enrage timer, right? They never would have got this without the 5% &quot;let's let casuals kill the lich king now!&quot; ICC buff. I'll be excited when someone gets this without using it, or having farmed ICC 25 while using it and THEN turning it off.<br />

It's been said over and over again. The video will be out once some other guild kills it - you posting something on forums that has been debunked, trashed and totally destroyed in every possible way doesn't accomplish on putting any pressure on us whatsoever to release it earlier than intended. 8]<br />
<br />
I remember For the Horde killing LK25 on heroic as the second guild around 21:58 on 10.04.2010 or 11.04.2010 - can't remember which day it was exactly. Once they did, the video of Paragon's kill was out immediately on WCM and Youtube within like 5 minutes. It's a bit long story to explain and involves the Large Hadron Collider actually working properly back in 2016. It has started to become a bit of a haze and I'm not supposed to talk about it.<br />

<br />
<br />
What happens if Paragon gets the World First buffless kill? <br />
<br />
Is that kill &quot;not as good&quot; because they've had weeks to farm LK25 Heroic? Would a guild who killed the LK for the first time, without the buff, be better?<br />
<br />
The point is, you're breaking this down into a system of nothing more than semantics and general, all around, stupidity.<br />
<br />
The facts here, are Paragon was the only guild in the world to kill LK25H with a 5% buff, easily establishing them as the best in ICC. To refute that fact? You're going down a dark road with nothing more than your own system of worth.</div></div><hr />

You opened my eyes. FU paragon...freaking scrubs..u have no place in this game how dare you kill LK with mechanics blizz implemented.<br />
<br />
On a more serious note: Want to game abit more difficult for you? Stop using a mouse..that would boost the difficulty abit. What about just throw away your Monitor and play by sound..i hear that's what the pro guys are doing nowadays.<br />
<br />
Pssstt: I think Ensidia is trying him with no buffs and by no buffs i mean 0% no raid buffs/no bloodlust and doing it with theyre headphones alone..yes yes thats why its taking them forever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The question is: Why does this matter?<br />
<br />
If it's okay for them to farm ICC25H forever with the buff, and then turn it off for LK once the gear makes a big enough impact, isn't that the SAME EXACT THING, just taking a different route, by gaining that 5% through gear instead of a buff?</div></div><hr />

I am sure they did not kill the boss to impress you. Now stop being so superior to the rest of us and atleast show abit of respect and throw a gratz or smth betwen your trollin words 1stly to a guild that finally didnt put techno music in theyre world 1st kill and secondly for what they achieved.<br />

The val'kyr don't die (while carrying people) in heroic mode.<br />

You DPS them to a certain percentage, then they fly back above the LK's head, and damage people, until it's time for the next round.</div></div><hr />

You aren't impressed? Seriously? 2 guilds have now killed the hardest current boss in the game, only 2, and 1 of them did it with a 5% buff and you aren't impressed? Only 1 guild, in the entire world, all of it, managed to do this, and yet somehow you aren't impressed? You are kidding right? Just trolling? How could you not be impressed? This is the most impressive thing to happen in wow in quite some time. What would it have taken? First day before noon kill naked with only abilities you start the game with? And no talent points spent? Honestly, what would it take now for you to be impressed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I enjoy the progress of all major guilds, and it's really cool seeing LK HM go down. However if you are correct in your guess that Ensidia will somehow down a 0% buff and claim it as a more legit kill and therefore &quot;more&quot; World First, and &quot;more qualifying&quot; I think I'm going to lose the last of my respect for them :/</div></div><hr />

How can people not call this epic? Getting a kill like this is certainly much much MUCH more epic then getting some piece of loot and going &quot;ZOMG! LOOK AT MY GEARZZ! I'AM AWESOME!!&quot; Your gear doesn't make you awesome. All the arguments about casuals shouldn't be getting good gear or do some bosses are just lame excuses from people who think they have the rights on some things and anyone who couldn't grind for hours shouldn't be able get it. <br />
<br />
LK25hc is open to casuals aswell, why can't they kill him? Because he is truly tough and epic. You want to show you're awesome? Get kills like LK25hc, not some lame purple pixel which will be replaced in a few days. Of course there will be more epic fights like this in the future. But it be hard to overcome the awesomeness of LK.<br />

I'm not questioning the fact that they're skilled. Stop trying to justify your fanboy rage and take it easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
then you should stop posting stupid stuff like &quot;yah, they killed him with the 5% buff, the only guild in the world who did it before the buff went to 10%, they are scrubs, im not impressed till they do it with 0% buff and naked&quot;<br />
<br />
stop acting like a moron, no guild has done him without the buff, and there is none happening in the seeable future, so just stop trolling and stop posting</div></div><hr />

I don't believe this.....was that common sense, on the INTERNET?!?!?!? Seriously though, I do wish more people would show some respect for the top guilds, or at least not trash on them all the time. All the top 100 guilds are better than 99% of the people who post on this site.</div></div><hr />

Teh lack of the word heroic in there must be a bug or something, because he clearly got the light of dawn.<br />
<br />
<br />
*shoves foot in mouth*<br />

It was a friendly poke. :)<br />
<br />
You were correct, the achievements that pop up do NOT say anything about a realm first, but it's in the chatbox. Really easy to miss, and honestly, when I first saw it, I thought the same thing.<br />
<br />
And yep, the actual Feat of Strength doesn't say Heroic in the title. http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=4576<br />
<br />
Can get a bit confusing.</div></div><hr />

which is pretty broken by design as there is no way you can get the realm first without the other two.</div></div><hr />

It's not broken, it's just a cosmetic thing...you still get the achievement. You can get 5408 achievements at once, they just won't pop up.</div></div><hr />

I wonder, what is that strange urge that you must be having that makes you, in this your one and only praise to this achievement by Paragon, include a little hatred towards Ensidia. I know your not alone but i cant understand it. &quot;You guys are crap now&quot;. Do you actually really believe that or are you just writing that to feel like one in the gang? <br />
<br />
Isnt it easy to be a jerk when you are behind a screen, totally anonomous. Strange indeed, the psychology of man.</div></div><hr />

Edit: The combat log (it actually appears to be a whisper box, but same point) is on top of the chat box, said by the poster below me. Good eye.<br />
<br />
It's impossible for only a handful of people to get the realm first Feat of Strength. It's everyone in the first raid, and then nobody else on that realm after that.</div></div><hr />

Everyone got the achievement, but you only see the last 4 in the combat log with all the scrolling. Their combat log is on top of the chat making it look like one large chat box.</div></div><hr />

My opinion: yes. <br />
<br />
A sponsor lets you do the game instead of doing other things; you still have to do everything in game yourself, the right way. <br />
<br />
Buying gold allows you to take real world resources and directly convert them into tangible resources in-game. <br />
<br />
The end result is the same, that you are able to do more in game as a result of resources spent in real life. However, the fact that you are doing everything in game for yourself makes a huge difference... not even counting the fact that by buying gold, you're supporting hackers and account thieves :-P</div></div><hr />

Thanks for a decent answer. To be honest, I still don't know... To me, looks the same. They both gives unfair advantage. Besides not all gold sellers are account thieves. It's not that profitable to steal accounts as people may think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way things are at the moment, you need the buff to kill the Lich king on heroic 25. The boss enraged just a few seconds he died. Without the buff it would likely have lead to a wipe. I bet you haven't even killed the Lich King at all. Even if you did, you definitely used the buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
^what this guy said<br />
<br />
There's a reason the buff was introduced, taking a shot at it: Blizz didnt want the final epic boss to be able to be beaten within the first couple months and have therefore implemented a way to plausibly make it so that people can beat it without round upon round of ICC nerfs. Think of it as the Sunwell nerfs except in opposite fashion</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
they had a fury warrior who could sunder, but by the looks of it it seemed like the rogue who was frapsing was using expose armor.<br />

<br />
they had practiced kiting him on normal mode before they ever attempted the HM kills but in the end they seemed to have gotten him right on the enrage timer, im sure if they use that same comp once more with the better gear they have atm they can do it with no buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the start of the fight until right before he is killed, a majority of the music is from the Transformers score by Steve Jablonsky. The intro music and the ending music I don't recognize, but it could be from the Transformers 2 score.<br />

All of the music is listed in the video description. Pretty much everything is from movie scores and bands and groups that do almost nothing but make movie/movie trailer music, which is a never-ending source of bombastic, epic music.</div></div><hr />
