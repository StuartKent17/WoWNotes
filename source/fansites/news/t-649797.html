Raidcomp updated to patch 3.1<br />
Better late than never, right? During the last few weeks the Raid composition tool (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/) has been updated with various changes from patch 3.1. We should now have a fairly reliable version but don't hesitate to point out any error. <br />
<br />
Raidcomp Patch 3.1 Update (Rev 5) (Link (http://raidcomp.mmo-champion.com/))<br />
Afffliction Warlock: Improved Shadow Bolt<br />
Blessing of Kings: Base ability for all paladins.<br />
Curse of Recklessness has been removed.<br />
Curse of Weakness: Now also reduces the armor of the target by 5%.<br />
Divine Spirit: Base ability for all priests.<br />
Hunting Party: Spell ID has been fixed.<br />
Improved Divine Spirit: This talent has been removed.<br />
Improved Soul Leech: Mana regen ability for Destruction Warlocks.<br />
Improved Water Elemental: Renamed Enduring Winter.<br />
Protection Paladin: Heart of the Crusader<br />
Stampede adds a 25% bleed damage debuff (that does not stack with Mangle etc.).<br />
Unleashed Rage is now a 3/3 talent instead of 5/5 talent.<br />

Blue posts<br />
Professions<br />
Why did it take so long to nerf Jewelcrafting?<br />
The question was asked on this (and other issues) if it was OP before why did it take so long to nerf it? Usually the answer is some combination of the following (and not just with regard to JC):<br />
<br />
1) It was only slightly OP until players really started gearing up with new combinations of items that things get out of control.<br />
<br />
2) We had a long-term plan to do something differently and decided either that plan was going to get bumped or we couldn't wait for its implementation.<br />
<br />
3) We have a really long list of changes we want to make to WoW. Some things just take awhile to get to. More critical issues do get bumped to the top, but sometimes it still takes us a bit to agree on the right change and often bug fixes get even higher priority than design changes.<br />
<br />
If you see something that seems off, chances are good that we do too but just haven't gotten to it yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367806783-is-there-room-for-minmax-players.html))<br />
<br />
Player vs. Player<br />
Balance in 2vs2 Arena matches<br />
As we have hinted at several times, part of the problem is the over-emphasis of the 2s bracket. It's easier to organize and more-rewarding -- we get that. We also think it's a problem.<br />
<br />
The 2s are just never going to be as balanced as larger brackets. When you only have 2 players on your team you are always going to be at the mercy of a really strong counter-comp -- you can essentially lose as soon as the door opens and you see who's on the other side. Fixing this involves doing a lot of things we don't want to do, such as compressing even more abilities into every class so that you can be assured of having a really large toolbox (Mortal Strike, non-physical damage, Dispel Magic, roots, non-DR CC, etc. etc.) even with just two characters.<br />
<br />
A lot of the &quot;dominance&quot; problems that we see and that players complain about go away when you look at the 3s bracket (not there aren't problems that replace them, like the abundance of RMP). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17367806934-inevitable-nerf-of-druids.html))<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Sunwell-level raid difficulty<br />
Are you refering to the part where warrior tanks were kept alive by casting an anti-druid aura over the whole raid? Or the part where you stacked shamans for Chain Heal and Heroism rotations? Or where the mages were bumped to make room for more warlocks to benefit from Curse of Shadows? Or where paladins were parked outside to buff everyone in between wipes? <br />
<br />
Players who liked Sunwell generally liked it because it was hard, not because the class balance was so exceptional. Mimiron's big red button is hard if that's your thing. Algalon is hard.<br />
<br />
A lot of the tank balance problems we are having exist because we thought block would be a better mitigation stat than it has turned out to be. I say &quot;we&quot; because the druids and DKs were also convinced at the time that they would be mana-sponges and everyone was quoting &quot;The unblocked hit is the new crushing blow.&quot;<br />
<br />
For a variety of reasons, reality didn't work out that way. For one, we underestimated how much removing crushing blows would change the landscape. In fact, you can argue that the big magic hits (the dragon breaths and plasma blasts) are really the new crushing blows, and block does nothing to them (modulo 4 piece bonuses and the like). DKs were given amazing cooldowns, high armor and high avoidance to make up for them not being able to block. Druids were given even higher armor and high health. We backed druids off from that a little in part because they were going to end up with dps stats almost no matter what gear they chose so we wanted to incorporate those a little more into tanking. We kept buffing DKs based on early (mostly heroic dungeon) reports that healers hated healing DKs because they were so squishy when their cooldowns were blown. That seems to be less of an issue now with current levels of gear and some of the other changes to the game since then.<br />
<br />
We will almost certainly change block. I can't tell you when we'll change it, because it's a big change. We probably don't want shield-users to be at 100% up time of block if they block more per hit. We have to be careful what happens to threat since that's a big part of block, especially for warriors. Heck, maybe we fall in love with the 4 piece warrior bonus and decide to make that a core part of the ability.<br />
<br />
We might very well nerf DK mitigation or cooldowns again. We're less worried about druids, but if we nerfed DKs it might be that druids take their place. We are less likely to just buff the shield-using tanks because we like the current difficulty of the hardmode fights for them and we are reluctant to have to buff those encounters to correspond for a tank buff. Though as we've said elsewhere, we might give paladins another cooldown.<br />
<br />
Just remember that one player's &quot;slight advantage&quot; is another's &quot;faceroll tanking and trivializing encounters.&quot; The balance goal has always been &quot;close enough&quot; not &quot;identical.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17223093590-the-problem-is-not-dks.html))<br />
<br />
Itemization<br />
Class-specific items<br />
We don't want to expand boss loot tables. That makes it less likely you'll end up with you want, not more. If we make druid tanking sticks, and druid rings, and druid trinkets, then you have more stuff that other tanks can't wear. Therefore when players say &quot;Please remove this stat from my gear,&quot; our answer is almost always &quot;No, because we want other classes to share that gear.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are always just some sub-optimal items. Those are there by design. Not everything is intended to be an upgrade and we want to reward players who understand the finer points of their class enough to know when something is an upgrade and when it's not. (And I'll throw in my standard dig that if you are simply picking something because a spreadsheet or website told you too, make sure you're making the right choice for your character.) However some items also have mistakes in them and we are getting those fixed up over time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17367977092-itemization-team-is-right-you-are-wrong.html))<br />
<br />
Items upgrades<br />
When bosses reward too well then groups finish the content too quickly and then ask why we haven't released anything new yet.<br />
<br />
If an item drops that improves some of your stats but lowers others, that is far more interesting from a game-design point of view than if you *always* knew you were going to get an upgrade. One thing I always stress is that games should be about interesting decisions. Deciding if you can afford the loss of hit to get more strenth, or trying to decide if the parry rating is worth losing a little stamina are interesting decisions. There are not always clear cut answers. It lets players demonstrate mastery of the game when they can make the right choice for their character. A best in slot item is not worth it if you have to sacrifice too much of another stat to use it. An item with tons of defense can be the best thing for you if you are wearing blues to hit the cap, or the worst thing for you if you are already comfortably above the cap. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17367977092-itemization-team-is-right-you-are-wrong.html))<br />
<br />
Intellect more attractive than Spirit<br />
It's not a problem that Int is a more attractive stat that Spirit. You are rarely choosing between the two directly. There are not +50 Int legs that you drop your +50 Spirit legs to equip. If you are a Spirit-using class (especially a priest or druid) you will most likely have some Int and some Spirit almost no matter what you do.<br />
<br />
It is a potential problem when one class can ignore Spirit while another class is required to pick it up. Because Int is more rewarding in the long run, being able to go with just Int means your mana pool and crit are also increasing compared to the dude who has to give up those stats in order to have enough Spirit.<br />
<br />
It works if the classes are balanced assuming you don't have Spirit, which is the case for say Resto shamans. It does bad things to the game if we assume you have certain amounts of a stat but players manage to find ways to do without that stat which result in them being more powerful than other classes. Make sense? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17367597239-why-is-spirit-a-regen-stat-if-int-isnt.html))<br />

Moonkin T8 4 Pieces Bonus<br />
We have a fix for the current set bonus to make it work the way you imagine it should at a 7 or 8% proc chance. It's our policy not to announce patch dates ahead of time, but it will be long before 3.2. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223066812-any-news-on-moonkin-4pt8.html))<br />
<br />
Tree Form compared to Shadowform and Moonkins<br />
You can make many of the same arguments about Shadowform and Moonkin form that you can make about Tree of Life form. Yet it still feels different. Giving up your healing abilities for damage and utility just doesn't seem the same as giving up your damage and utility to heal.<br />
<br />
It may be that giving up healing to compete with damage classes doesn't feel so bad because most damage classes can't heal anyway. But giving up your damage to compete with healers when A) the other healers don't have to, and B) healer damage isn't great in the first place, just feels a little different.

MP5 vs. Crit as a regen stat<br />
We don't have a problem with paladins liking crit as a regen stat. It only gets to be a problem when the paladins refuse to ever use MP5 and get angry when it shows up on their plate. We balanced paladins around the assumption of having some MP5. If they have no MP5 then it is likely they are too powerful. The same thing would happen if we let say a mage stack all spellpower at the expense of Stamina. <br />
<br />
As I said though, we need to see a few more guilds attempt hard modes to know how regen really stands. I agree with the players who say that people asserting that mana is infinite (for any healer) haven't tackled enough hard modes yet.

Retribution burst damage in PvP<br />
We don't think burst is a problem in PvP right now. We do think the Ret &quot;rotation&quot; is problematic. You essentially have a spec without a meaningful resource (Rets generally don't run out of mana) with attacks that are entirely cooldown-controlled, which allows them to be front-loaded. The bubble is certainly powerful along with dispels and things like Freedom. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367977149-possible-solution-to-paladin-opness.html))<br />

Hunger For Blood<br />
It's not acceptable for rogues or anyone to have so much power in one talent point. We have said pretty consistently that we don't want Hunger for Blood to remain in its current incarnation long term, however it solves the problem for now of keeping Assassination viable in PvE without it being overpowered in PvP. Other fixes would involve major changes to the rogue tree that would likely cause other issues we'd then have to solve. It's too big a risk when what we have works... for now. We have a long list of things we want to improve in the game. HfB is just one of them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html))<br />

Restoration - Chain Heal in PvE<br />
We're not convinced there is a Resto or Chain Heal problem in PvE. Part of what we wanted to do was give shamans other spells to cast besides CH. Riptide is an awesome spell and seems to be fun for a lot of shamans. People are still casting CH, and probably a lot more often than priests are using PoH and druids WG (depending on the fight of course). We would want to make sure that any change to CH didn't send shamans back to the Sunwell world of just using that one spell.<br />
<br />
Yes it is iconic, and it's fine if shamans use it a lot. If they only use one button, shaman players are likely to mush their brains. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17367876728-it-is-time-to-address-chain-heal.html))<br />

Titan's Grip<br />
The problem with TG is that it provides too much of a dps increase for one point. What other talents you can reach or not reach is irrelevant to that point. We don't want one talent point to inflate your dps by 20% or more. That sets a really dangerous precedent, makes other talents seems like a waste, causes Fury damage to jump enormously as soon as they can reach that talent and a host of other problems. <br />
<br />
[...] TG would probably be a lot better as 10 point talent. The fact remains: do those other talents improve your dps? Yes. Do they improve it without TG? Yes. Do they improve it with TG? Yes. Does equipping a higher item level weapon improve your dps? Does Titan's Grip somehow negate your equipping that weapon because of its penalty? No. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html))<br />
<br />
Titan's Grip Penalty<br />
We're happy with the damage reduction. The haste and hit reductions had other problems. Since TG adds too much damage, taking some away seems like the right choice. It's an unusual talent; it's unfortunate but not too surprising that it has taken some time to get right. Warriors were doing too much damage in Naxx (and not just on gimmick fights and not just when fully geared). Some warriors are used to doing rogue damage, but that's not our design any longer. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html))<br />
<br />
1H Fury<br />
We aren't trying to keep 1-handed Fury viable. We aren't trying to keep two-handed Enhancement viable. We aren't trying to keep staff-using warriors viable. Just because you can equip something doesn't mean you have a right to be effective with it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html))<br />
<br />
Improving Fury DPS<br />
We have a different plan for improving dps, one that should also make the rotation a little cleaner. It's something that has been suggested on the forums a few times. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367976663-stop-wasting-gcs-time.html))<br />

Are you refering to the part where warrior tanks were kept alive by casting an anti-druid aura over the whole raid? Or the part where you stacked shamans for Chain Heal and Heroism rotations? Or where the mages were bumped to make room for more warlocks to benefit from Curse of Shadows? Or where paladins were parked outside to buff everyone in between wipes?<br />
<br />
Players who liked Sunwell generally liked it because it was hard, not because the class balance was so exceptional. Mimiron's big red button is hard if that's your thing. Algalon is hard.<br />
<br />
To begin with, i think this is kinda lame...I did like the class balance, i liked that Warriors were best Boss tanks, druids were best offtanks due the dps form they could take at boss and paladins were good AoE tanks.<br />
Same goes for Mages, Lock, Rogues...they are pure dps class so it seems only logical they should top meters. And the same goes for healers.<br />
<br />
The cool aspect of a raid was that you NEEDED to bring a class with the right specc to the raid or it was nearly inpossible to down him. Paladins were most of the time MT healers druid had theire Raid healing, etc...<br />
<br />
Imo what was rong to give each class and specc their own special ability that is needed to make progress in raids.<br />
It brought another dimension of searching for good setups in raid to make progress, also you used to organize all off the groups so you could pull max Dps-Healing-TPS in fights.<br />
<br />
All these aspects and made a raid harder, not ONLY the boss tactics itself...<br />
My main point is, it is good to make changes...but not to much as Blizz is doing atm. <br />
<br />
PS: Sorry for my English, and if i am rong please correct in me in a normal way insted of flaming...this was just how i see it.</div></div><hr />

Just a suggestion. In my opinion Grace should be replaced by Renewed Hope. Grace isn't providing any damage reduction anymore. But yeah, it isn't a problem really, the point is that disc priest brings damage reduction and thats what RaidComp says ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I would like to know if Renewed hope stack with BoS or not. Pre 3.1 Grace DID stack! I know even Blizzard said it doesn't but it did. I tested it by myself and asked other priests and paladins to do the same to confirm it.<br />
I haven't tried it in 3.1 because I switched to holy and thus don't care that much, but now I am really curious, but I am at work...someone could test it now and let us know here :)<br />
<br />
Just take your paladin friend, be in a party with him. Cast PW:S on yourself (he will get Renewed Hope) duel him, put Shadow Word: Pain on him and watch for how much it ticks before Renewed Hope fade out. (SW:P is always doing the same damage so it is easy to see the difference). Do this with and without BoS, with and without Renewed Hope and compare results.</div></div><hr />

I'm not quite sure I understand why it matters that one point provides too high a dps increase, if its that high up the talent tree. I suppose the point is to make fury viable without it, but with this comment:<br />

We aren't trying to keep 1-handed Fury viable. We aren't trying to keep two-handed Enhancement viable. We aren't trying to keep staff-using warriors viable. Just because you can equip something doesn't mean you have a right to be effective with it.<br />

The issue is GC, that Resilience doesn't do it's job thus allowing people in half PvE gear to dominate PvP. While, for example, I am wearing 904 Resilience plus an additional 105 from the Berserker Card plus an additional 50 from Lesser Flask of Toughness (a total of 1,059 resilience), I still get hit by a chain of 2.5k Mutilate Crits and 5k+ Eviscerate Crits. Rogues, Rets and DK's, the most bursty classes, seemingly have no trouble in criting all the time and for huge amounts of damage even through over 1k resilience.<br />
<br />
Rogues really aren't too much of a problem as they are at least killable, and DK's are at least kitable, but Rets really are a pain in the ass. Rets cannot be kited, have a ridiculous amount of defensive abilities on very short cooldowns, can attack while they are immune to everything, have unlimited mana, plate armour, instant heals, and they cause about 1.5 times the damage a Rogue does.<br />
<br />
Simply put, you should force Rogues, Rets and DK's to use full PvP gear like the rest of us poor plebs and you should take some steps to ensure that these classes cannot output a ridiculous amount of damage in a very short time.<br />
<br />
Compared to the above, my 4k AP Hunter's Aimed Shot and Arcane Shot while using Siren's Cry (an Ulduar 25 drop) and Saronite Razorheads (Blue Ammo), crit on a Ret for 1,250ish and 1,700ish respectively. My auto shot crits on a Ret for 900ish and my Steady Shot crits for 800ish while my pet hits for abt 150 damage and crits for 300 when its attacks are not dodged/parried/blocked. In fact, DK Ghouls and Warlock Felguards hit harder and do more dps than a Beast Mastery Pet in PvP.<br />
<br />
During the same time-frame and against an opponent with 1,059 resilience (more or less 6 seconds) a DK can unload abt 18k damage, a Mutilate Rogue can unload abt 14k damage, and a Ret will definitely kill you.</div></div><hr />

May i point out , that when you select a demology warlock, the change of you actualy having demonic pact is almost none.<br />
Most warlocks dont go further then 41 points into demonology and therefor neglecting that talent.</div></div><hr />

I hear you. Yesterday in Arena died within 3 GCDs to a retribution paladin. Myself I'm a warrior with 700 resilience and was almost full (had 30k hp (mdw and commanding shout)). He had wings and I got a couple lucky crits too (50% dmg returned, wasn't it?) but still, this is just ridiculous. Granted, we usually don't have a big problem with paladins, but if they get lucky at one point it's game over.</div></div><hr />

I'm not quite sure I understand why it matters that one point provides too high a dps increase, if its that high up the talent tree. I suppose the point is to make fury viable without it, but with this comment:<br />
<br />
That seems rather unlikely. It seems like a non-issue.<br />
<br />
I agree. It's not like fury warriors are worthless pre-lv60 now because they don't have TG?<br />
<br />
Also, I'm confused about making TG itself LESS of a massive DPS increase, but at the same time buff fury DPS as a whole. I suppose they have some kind of tweak in mind, but I'd say the 10% damage reduction is more than enough to smoothen out TG. Just crank it up through other talents instead. 0:</div></div><hr />

In case of mages, better said the sole mage, buff intellect, provide food and portal at the end :P<br />
<br />
TBC was an unbalanced piece of crap regarding classes. Sunwell itself was a very interesting raid and challenge, but the way it promoted class stacking was absurd and detrimental to the game.<br />
<br />
WotLK walked in the other direction - homogenization - maybe too much. I agree that having class roles can be interesting (as long as there is something for everybody in a balanced way), and the current situation is not completely interesting, namely in AOE- everyone and their mother can AOE like crazy mostly at a safe distance (&quot;push the button and yawn&quot;).<br />

Hunger For Blood<br />
It's not acceptable for rogues or anyone to have so much power in one talent point. We have said pretty consistently that we don't want Hunger for Blood to remain in its current incarnation long term, however it solves the problem for now of keeping Assassination viable in PvE without it being overpowered in PvP. <br />

On the Resto Shaman part, are you kidding me? Resto shaman's are crazy good in arena. Wtf are they talking about, battlegrounds? lol. I got a feeling this game is going down hill.. Slowly but surely.<br />
<br />
Every other melee dps class has a slow but Ret. Everyone of them has a very short cooldown interrupt but Ret. That's why we have hand of freedom, but that can't last forever, once it's off we are back to being kited. When we attack a healer(with pvp gear) they pretty much just jump up and down knowly we can't really kill them until their out of mana. Ret an't OP at all. If you play one, you'll know having all cooldowned skills about that somewhat of a burst, you there melee swinging and can't interrupt a channeling heal or what not. It's depressing.<br />

There are currently a few rogues out there who roll with healers using HfB in pvp. You have to have quite a bit of resilience to live through other rogues/classes burst and lose a good deal of cooldowns but once HfB and SnD go up you're pretty much an upstoppable damage machine.<br />
<br />
Still not too popular, if it was an ezmode gladiator spec for all rogues it would've been hotfixed by now.</div></div><hr />

not really. JoJ works on druids, and guarantees that outside of cooldowns used, a Ret will catch up to who their chasing with freedom up. 100% vs. 115% is pretty huge, especially since judgment can be applied at a range.</div></div><hr />

Balance in 2vs2 Arena matches<br />
As we have hinted at several times, part of the problem is the over-emphasis of the 2s bracket. It's easier to organize and more-rewarding -- we get that. We also think it's a problem.<br />
<br />
The 2s are just never going to be as balanced as larger brackets. When you only have 2 players on your team you are always going to be at the mercy of a really strong counter-comp -- you can essentially lose as soon as the door opens and you see who's on the other side. Fixing this involves doing a lot of things we don't want to do, such as compressing even more abilities into every class so that you can be assured of having a really large toolbox (Mortal Strike, non-physical damage, Dispel Magic, roots, non-DR CC, etc. etc.) even with just two characters.<br />
<br />
A lot of the &quot;dominance&quot; problems that we see and that players complain about go away when you look at the 3s bracket (not there aren't problems that replace them, like the abundance of RMP). (Source)<br />
<br />
Strong counter comps FOR ANYONE THAT PLAYS ARENA in 2v2.<br />
1.disc priest +warrior or rogue or DK or ret pally<br />
2.resto druid + warrior or rogue or DK or ret pally<br />
<br />
The name of the new game is Rock,paper,scissors and melee. melee beats the other 3. all you other clothys the problem aint that melee do to much dmg at the moment you all just have disc priest and resto druid as your counter class.<br />
<br />
patch note:Pillars have been added to the counter class list of anyone that has to stop and cast to do any real dmg.<br />
<br />
<br />
you can essentially lose as soon as the door opens and you see who's on the other side. not true you cant see resto druid and a rogue lol!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abani</div><div class="date">2009-05-24, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the only thing they have to say about Restoration spec, for weeks maybe months, is they don't believe there is an issue with Chain Heal in PVE.<br />
<br />
There most certainly is an issue. Not because spamming chain heal isn't viable anymore, I love the way a Shaman heals nowadays.<br />
But our class' role has been built up as a raid healer for years. We do an okay job at it now, but other healing classes can do it better.<br />
<br />
So where is our role? Where is our defining factor that give Shamans a clear place they can excel at?<br />
Tidal Waves + Healing Wave x2 makes us an okay tank healer, and Earth Shield is fantastic atm.<br />
But Paladins do tank healing better too.<br />
<br />
This is why Shamans ask about Chain Heal and claim it isn't good anymore. It was our defining factor. Now we have all these new means of healing effectively, but they are underwhelming when compared to the other healing class' niche abilities.<br />
<br />
Totems are worthless. Blizzard saw to that when they made nearly all our totems not stack with other buffs that last much longer and don't need to be re-dropped when you move.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to waste my time going into it further.<br />
We have GREAT utility, don't get me wrong. <br />
But any resto shaman with half a brain recognizes their spec is a little gimped right now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HurfDurf</div><div class="date">2009-05-24, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with TG is that it provides too much of a dps increase for one point. What other talents you can reach or not reach is irrelevant to that point. We don't want one talent point to inflate your dps by 20% or more. That sets a really dangerous precedent, makes other talents seems like a waste, causes Fury damage to jump enormously as soon as they can reach that talent and a host of other problems.<br />
<br />
[...] TG would probably be a lot better as 10 point talent. The fact remains: do those other talents improve your dps? Yes. Do they improve it without TG? Yes. Do they improve it with TG? Yes. Does equipping a higher item level weapon improve your dps? Does Titan's Grip somehow negate your equipping that weapon because of its penalty? No<br />
<br />
No one point talents should give close to a 20 percent DPS increase eh?<br />
<br />
No other single potent talent point is REQUIRED in a spec huh?<br />
<br />
Shamans- Dual Wield is a 1 point talent... and I'm pretty sure it's a DPS increase and required.<br />
<br />
Priests- Shadowform..... one point, big boost, and required to be competant.<br />
<br />
rogues- Mutilate for assassination, Blade Flurry for Combat, Shadow Dance for deep subtley. The first two I know are &quot;required&quot; and give a big DPS leap.<br />
<br />
Mages- Arcane barrage.<br />
<br />
Paladins- Crusader Strike..I'm pretty damn sure it's MORE than a 20 percent increase for one point.<br />
<br />
Warlocks: Haunt/Unstable affliction. take your pick.<br />
<br />
<br />
Face it, there are talents that are &quot;required&quot;, one point, and potent as hell. Why should warriors get hammered on for finally having a one pointer that level of usefulness?<br />
<br />
Also in the same vein, try making all of those aformentioned talents a &quot;10 point talent&quot; and see how many subscribers you have at the end of the week.</div></div><hr />

And even the devs know that this game is coming down to shit?<br />
It used to be where,PvP isn't balanced around 1v1<br />
And now the new excuse for PvP is,this game isn't balanced around 2v2.<br />
<br />
<br />
A shorter version would just be &quot;PvP isn't balanced&quot;.<br />
<br />
Never has been, never will be, why do you even bother?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
where exactly did i say this game should be 1V1 balanced?<br />
i said that blizz just doesn't bother with balancing PvP in no way or another other than giving in by saying its impossible,and by you guys going along with them and agreeing.I mean seriously how much more hope can you guys not have.</div></div><hr />

This. One of the reasons I decided to quit after 4 fucking years is that Blizzard has no fucking clue about the game anymore, GC and his legion of interns are running the show now :(</div></div><hr />

I cant wait to get in there... if i ever find me a guild that's actually pro enough to handle hard more uld that is :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holylighter</div><div class="date">2009-05-25, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice video but for the love of God, is there no guild on the entire planet able to pick out a half-decent piece of music to accompany the visuals? WoW players must have the worst taste in music in the history of the universe.<br />
<br />
<br />
...also, just because YOU dont like it, doesnt mean everyone else doesnt like it and vice versa.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moox</div><div class="date">2009-05-25, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you for RaidComp, it's a great tool.<br />
<br />
Some suggestions:<br />
- Buff: Intellect: Fel Intelligence is improvable with Improved Felhunter (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=54038), but still weaker than Arcane Intellect<br />
- Buff: Mana Regen (Blessing): You should add the Mana Spring Totem (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=58774), improvable through Restorative Totems (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=16206), still 1 mp5 weaker than BoW (intentionally, to prevent overwriting)<br />
- Buff: Mana Regen (Pet): As someone mentioned, move Enduring Winter (water elemental) to Replenishment<br />
- Buff: Spirit: Improvable through Improved Felhunter<br />
- Debuffs: Armor (Minor): The improvement (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=18180) for Curse of Weakness does only increase the attack power reduction, so you could remove the [ i ] in this category<br />
- Debuffs: Attack Power: Curse of Weakness is weaker than the warrior or druid shouts (if improved), so you could add an [ w ]<br />
- Debuffs: Spell Damage Taken: Curse of Elements is not weaker than the other debuffs, and is no longer improvable, so you could remove both [ i w ]<br />
<br />
Thanks for the great work :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Marksman and Survival Hutners can not provide the &quot;Bleed Damage&quot; debuff<br />
And Beastmasters can provide the debuf for 12 sec with 1 min CD<br />
<br />
So we hunters should not have this debuff to our group at all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mechleader</div><div class="date">2009-05-26, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For raid comp, when I throw down a Survival hunter, it says that there is a bleed affect from stampede. Impossible I think so...<br />

Edit: totally missed this dude right above me =\</div></div><hr />

<br />
When priests lead the 2v2 bracket, they get the nerfbat after 1 and a half weeks, and they get it HARD.<br />
When it's druids though, the problem is &quot;you have to look at the bigger picture&quot;. <br />
<br />
LOLWTFGC.<br />

Sign on that... Druids is just getting higher up for every day that goes. Just check it out by yourself on sk-gaming.com/arena/</div></div><hr />
