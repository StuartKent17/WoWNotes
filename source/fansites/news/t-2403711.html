Feral feels bad to the point of unplayability compared to live. TF on GCD in particular but there is plenty of commentary on other issues else-wear.<br />
Elemental still needs something, Flame shock cooldown hurts a lot and removes a lot of fun/LvB procs. <br />
Havoc doesn't feel right to me, I love the live T4+Helm playstyle and it is completely neutered.<br />

Azerite Armor is a shit replacement for tier sets/legendaries/artifact weapons (ALL THREE ARE GONE), Really really disappointed that the bonuses are so fucking bland.

A GM responding to a player is the one that started the meme of &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot;, which the achievement is a clear reference to.<br />
They used explosives in the exploit<br />
It was against the Lich King<br />
