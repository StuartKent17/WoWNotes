<br />
Reputation requirements for heroic instances<br />
There is no plan to remove them.<br />
We have no current plans to remove the revered reputation status as the requirement to get the heroic dungeon keys. While some realms may have a harder time finding groups than others, there are still people running them that you can group with and I'm pretty sure they really want to get the reputation too. Keep looking for people to team up with and you'll get there. <br />

European voice chat ramp-up + additional delay<br />
Vaneras posted the list of realms used to test the voice chat when the 2.2 comes live, some english and german realms are listed but absolutely nothing for the french ones. Also it seems that european players will have to wait one more week to get the voice chat deployed on all the realms (two weeks instead of one in the US)<br />
<br />
In the upcoming patch we will be introducing voice chat, which allows players to talk to each other in-game with the use of a microphone. To ensure that we provide the quality play experience weâ€™re committed to, we will be ramping up the voice chat feature in multiple stages. Currently we are scheduling voice chat to be available on patch day for a limited number of EU realms. While all realms will still receive the 2.2 patch, and all the content and changes therein, only some EU realms will have voice chat enabled at the start. We plan to then enable voice chat for a limited number of European realms and the remaining EU realms the following week, and one week later we will plan to enable it for the remaining European realms. This ramp up release will help us to test the voice chat feature in a live realm environment before enabling it on all realms.<br />

<br />
The initial set of realms that will have voice chat enabled the week after patch day:<br />
<br />
English: Earthen Ring, Ravencrest, Runetotem, Shadowmoon, Shadowsong, Shattered Hand, Silvermoon, Skullcrusher, Spinebreaker, Stormrage, Stormreaver, Stormscale, Terenas, Thunderhorn, Turalyon<br />
German: Aegwynn, Alexstrasza, Alleria, Antonidas, Baelgun, Blackhand, Destromath, Die Silberne Hand, Eredar, Frostmourne, Frostwolf, Gorgonnash, Gul'dan, Kel'Thuzad, Kil'Jaeden, Madmortem, Malfurion, Mal'Ganis, Mannoroth, Nathrezim, Nozdormu, Perenolde, Proudmoore, Zirkel des Cenarius, Zuluhed<br />
<br />
All other realms are scheduled to have voice chat enabled two weeks after the patch release week.<br />

Housing (and Stormwind &quot;locked instance&quot;)<br />
If you ever played an alliance character, you know that there is a huge instance portal in Stormwind blocked by a barrier. It's supposed to be one of the future housing zones, but sadly, it's been confirmed (again) that we won't see it before a long time.<br />
It's not necessarily &quot;not&quot; going to happen, we just have no announced plans to implement player housing. It's still there because, eh, who knows. Also, it brought you to the forums, and we've been hoping to say hello to you since you started playing. <br />
<br />
Motes/Primal system<br />
They will keep using the same mechanics as the one used for motes/primals (probably in the expansion too) making the drops less based on luck, all you need is time.<br />
Overall though we're happy with the mote/primal system, it works pretty well, and aside from the issues I stated of their rarity being unbalanced in some cases, we plan to continue with it.<br />
<br />
Hunter's pets leveling<br />
As far as I remember, a blue post said that they wouldn't do anything for pet leveling once they change the XP gain from 1 to 60, but I guess they changed their mind. <br />
We have plans to adjust how quickly a hunter's pet will level if there's a large gap between it and the hunter's level. However, it's still just a plan and not something we've implemented and thus are not ready to discuss it.<br />
<br />
2.3 Patch already full of changes<br />
This post is fairly interesting, it seems that there are already tons of changes in the 2.3 patch, and the only thing they need to release them is the 2.2 going live ... faster patch releases after the 2.2 ? (Not like it's really hard to do something faster than 2 months) <br />
We're currently focusing on the information and release of patch 2.2. All changes coming after 2.2 will be discussed after the patch has been released. There is no shortage of changes in the following patch, and we'll begin discussing them as soon as we can.<br />

Utgarde Keep<br />
I got mailed about it, and forgot to post it. A nice instance map made by Shandris was uploaded on WoWWiki.com (http://www.wowwiki.com/Image:UtgardeMapEarlyV.jpg) a few days ago. It's based on the one published in the September issue of GFW magazine. <br />

that's actually a pretty cool idea. Although just imagine how large that room would be. How many guilds does a server have, it might get messy.</div></div><hr />

Like you have to have 100+ members or so in order to have one, or 75% of the members have to be actively playing each month in order to retain the house. Something like that maybe more or less strict, I've never delt with them before so I'm not sure how they would deal with the requirements.</div></div><hr />

Then you'll have all the small guilds crying &quot;WHY DONT I GET A HOUSE WHY AM I LEFT OUT WAH WAH WAH&quot; i dont know how they'll work it out i dont really see a reason for it anyways we neeed to balance classes first before we sit here and start worrying about freakin houses... lets work on givin druids more animal skins lets give mages more water lets buff warlocks!!! lol fix the game then add to it...</div></div><hr />

Lvling pets is the most boring aspect of the game, this change is way overdue and i hope it is implemented ASAP. I'd love to have a bore from RFK or that black lion but I cant be bothered to spend the litterally 7 days of time played needed to lvl them to 70.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madz</div><div class="date">2007-09-15, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my personal opinion I think guild housing should be done similar to Guildwars, where a guild had to spend a certain amount of money in order to get the guild area. By doing it this way every guild can have one if they just spend the time to make the money. But in order for them to be successful, they would have to have something of use in the halls otherwise its just a waste of bandwidth even putting them in the game.</div></div><hr />
