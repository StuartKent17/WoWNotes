<br />
<br />
Rating requirements<br />
While Season 3 is still going strong, we wanted to announce ahead of time the rating requirements that will be present for arena items once Season 4 begins. We also wanted to give everyone a heads up to some changes that will be in an upcoming patch, altering how points are gained and players are matched in the arena system. The patch with these changes is scheduled to release before the start of Season 4.<br />
<br />
First though, the rating requirement changes:<br />
<br />
When Season 4 begins, Season 3 items will be reduced in personal and team arena rating requirement to:<br />
Shoulders: 1950<br />
Weapon: 1800<br />
<br />
The new Season 4 items will have the below personal and team arena rating requirements:<br />
Shoulders: 2200<br />
Weapon: 2050<br />
Head: 1700<br />
Chest: 1600<br />
Legs: 1550<br />
Gloves: none<br />
Off-hand: none<br />
<br />
In addition, some of the Season 4 quality items that will be purchasable with honor will also carry a personal and team arena rating requirement:<br />
Boots: 1700<br />
Ring: 1650<br />
Bracers: 1575<br />
Belt: none<br />
Necklace: none<br />
Trinket: none<br />
<br />
The Season 2 items, which will move to the honor system when Season 4 begins, will continue to have no rating requirement.<br />
<br />
The changes to the rating requirements for these items reflect the nature of the items, their power, and the relative difficulty that should be had when attempting to obtain them. These items are comparable to those found in the newest 25 person raid zone, Sunwell Plateau, and should therefore also feel very challenging to obtain.<br />
<br />
To help ensure that the challenge in obtaining these items stays true to those achieving these ratings, we'll also be implementing new rules with an upcoming patch to curb practices that undermine the core concepts of the arena system. These rules are as follows:<br />
If a character’s personal rating is more than 150 points below the team rating, they will earn points based on their personal rating instead of the team rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that a player cannot join a highly rated team and begin earning points based purely on the pre-established rating of the team before they joined it. They'll need to compete, improve, and gain a personal rating worthy of the points they would receive.<br />
If the average personal rating of the players queuing for a game is more than 150 points below the team’s rating, the team will be queued against an opponent matching or similar to the average personal rating.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that players cannot join a highly rated team and immediately face highly rated opponents, easily and quickly bringing their personal rating up. Instead they'll need to again compete, improve, and earn their rating.<br />
<br />
We're excited to see these changes implemented, which will continue to emphasize the strong competitive nature of the arenas, and the challenge in obtaining the highest end rewards available for PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So with S3 most warriors are at 67 hit rating and need 79 - miss 12 to cap. This is fixed easily by surefooted (10) + (optional) 4 hit gem for example. Now S4 have additional 22 (!) hit rating so even if you remove all hit gems and all hit enchants you still will have 89 hit rating which is a waste of 10 hit unless you fight protection warrior or frost mage.<br />

did you miss the part where is IDENTICAL to priest and warlock?<br />

&quot;Who are we fighting quick?&quot;<br />
&quot;Well either a druid or an unstealthed rogue, 2 warriors or pallies or one of each and 2 casters of some type&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
As a basis for comparison, using a fire mage with 1200 spell damage and 35% crit, it works out as follows (calculated using www.maxdps.com (http://www.maxdps.com)):<br />
<br />
227 haste = 161.4 dps<br />
227 damage = 138.9 dps<br />
<br />
So yes, 227 haste works as a fair lot better than 227 damage, I can see this becoming a very popular weapon should it see the light of day. Another advantage to haste in pvp is that spells become slightly harder to interrupt, you can get off a spell and move on faster than normal, and we all know how burst damage is valued in pvp :)<br />
<br />
My guess is that if we see these on live, they will have similar rating requirements to the S4 weapons, but christ knows why they keep putting spell hit on these things, makes me sad :(</div></div><hr />

Haste and damage don't cost the same, so your math immediately fails. 227 haste is equivalent to 266 damage. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Because hit rating is still important against players, the cap is just much lower than against level 73/boss mobs. If you equipped only s3 pvp gear as a warlock you'd get 5 points from the cap. As a mage you'd get a half of the way there. Point for point spell hit rating is the best stat you can get for dps until you cap(edit: the number is 38). Hit rating also helps on spells that don't even do damage, such as debuffs or crowd control. For warlocks there is even a reason to go beyond the cap, because many classes have fear-resist talents that are countered by hit rating. Even if you were for some reason at the cap, they added a whole 1 point of hit rating, and they probably only did that because increasing the stamina, int, or spell damage anymore would have put the item over budget.<br />

<br />
Sorry, you're right. I was thinking of the level 72 cap. The cap against a level 70 mob or player is 38, which is still more than you can get without gemming for it as a warlock or mage in s3 armor. A s4 lock in dreadweave would be at the cap.<br />

Except comparing against 227 damage is like comparing a s4 item against a s2 item. Of course the s2 item is going to be worse.</div></div><hr />

However.. essentially they're same dps, but haste % effects stack so the wep's haste and then using Ice Veins/heroism/power infusion would give you some extra % of haste so for pve, I think the spell haste weps could offer more dps.<br />
<br />
Like this...<br />
<br />
227 spell haste = 114.4%<br />
IV/Power Infusion = 120%<br />
Heroism/Bloodlust = 130%<br />
<br />
Having S4 wep equipped and then getting Heroism/Bloodlust example:<br />
<br />
114.4*1.3 = 148.72%<br />
<br />
So now heroism/bloodlust is giving you an extra 4.32% of spell haste, or 67.8 spell haste rating for its duration, which can add some sort of amount of dps that someone else can calculate.<br />
<br />

haste improves spells that do no damage. It also doesn't increase the DPS of dots, only the damage per cast time. Furthermore it makes it easier to get long cast spells off. Its not as simple as saying 'this is more damage' like you could do in pve.</div></div><hr />

I only compared it against damage because every caster is familiar with +damage on items and how it affects them, haste is relatively newer and a lot of people will not have had much of it before, so there is still some confusion over how it works out, especially compared to pure damage.<br />
<br />
It was not meant as a watertight mathematical analysis, more as a rough guide meant to aid the confused :)<br />
<br />
Having said all this, I believe there is a point before which haste is less valuable per point than damage, at least for mages and, especially, shadowpriests. I did some playing around on maxdps and came to the conclusion it was telling me to gem for pure damage gems at or below 1265 spell damage (164 hit and 35% crit, in case that might have anything to do with the calculations), and above that, 1266 and higher, it advised gemming pure haste gems (quick lionseye).<br />

Fair enough, but most people on forums that have no knowledge are just going to look at your numbers and say to themselves 'ZOMG HASTE IS BETTAR', when thats not necessarily the case.<br />
<br />
<br />

I did some playing around on maxdps and came to the conclusion it was telling me to gem for pure damage gems at or below 1265 spell damage (164 hit and 35% crit, in case that might have anything to do with the calculations), and above that, 1266 and higher, it advised gemming pure haste gems (quick lionseye).<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
From a purely pve standpoint, yes this is true. The stats are multiplicative, meaning that increasing one stat results in an increase in the relative value of the other stat. Blizzard, since the games release, has tried very hard to discourage players from stacking a single stat. If you stayed at that 1266 number for damage and stacked nothing but haste, eventually you would find that it would again tell you to stack spell damage gems.<br />
<br />
In pvp, though, haste has other benefits beyond just damage and doing a straight up comparison is foolhardy. For example if you consider the case of a mage that blinks away from melee, their GCD will be up much more quickly after the blink, and the subsequent cast will be much quicker. By 'much quicker' we are talking tenths of a second, but in an arena having an extra half or even quarter second can mean the difference between getting a frostbolt off and getting nothing off. It's really hard to quantify that benefit in pvp. <br />
<br />
I'm very dissappointed that the warlock and shadow priest sets have no haste on them, absolutely terrible job once again itemizing for these two classes. Each class could receive large amounts of haste for relatively little sacrifice in damage based on how itemization costs increase with more of a stat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
pretty sure that you use spells that do no damage in pve.<br />
<br />
also pretty sure that dot dps not increasing with haste is pretty important in pve.<br />
<br />
also pretty sure that there are fights that require you to move, so long cast spells being shorter is important.<br />

<br />
Since nothing has been posted, I'm guessing not...but then again any S4 version of Dory's Embrace wouldn't show up as a Arena item...instead it would be new badge gear.<br />
<br />
If someone's up on the PTR's could you check the badge gear and see if a new cloak has been made available?</div></div><hr />

Wotlk is close so they didn't want to spend weeks creating super good looking S4/Sunwell gear, as they will be replaced soon with Wotlk stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Close? WotLK is still 6+ months away yet, I gurantee it. Naxx came out what - like 6 or 8 months before BC? And that is some of the coolest armor in the game to this day.</div></div><hr />

Essentially they're saying they're busy working on a new product that we'll all need to pay for in a few months time so can't put adequate effort into the one we've already bought and continue to pay for every month.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, I'm looking forward to WotLK and am happy if all I have to suffer in the interim is some ugly equipment that I'll only ever obtain 4/5 of...<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno I would prefer them to dump most their resources to a full expansion so it comes out faster than dumping a lot into the last patch before the expansion unless WotlL is delayed.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lgtcount</div><div class="date">2008-05-01, 07:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">pretty sure that you use spells that do no damage in pve.<br />
<br />
also pretty sure that dot dps not increasing with haste is pretty important in pve.<br />
<br />
also pretty sure that there are fights that require you to move, so long cast spells being shorter is important.<br />
<br />
The only thing i shouldnt have said is 'like you could do in pve', because its really pretty much subjective all the time.<br />
<br />
also, nerd rage lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
also pretty sure it should be pretty obvious that I'm not referring to dot dps<br />
<br />
also pretty sure that if you have 1200 dmg and no spell haste, or 933 and 241 spell haste and are casting fireballs, you're still doing close to the same dps. <br />
<br />
It seems like you're referring to if you take spell haste wep instead of spell dmg wep your spells will be doing crap dmg. Yeah ok for pvp yes, I'm talking pve, and for pve with +dmg coming from so many other sources, your shit's still hitting for a good amount, and the haste brings the dps up so that it's about the same.<br />
<br />
Only point I tried to make was that haste could be better for dps if you're getting power infusion, icy veins, and heroism thrown on you throughout the fight.</div></div><hr />

Also, worth noting that these add up to less DPS than the S3 Axe for Hunters. Also, they're slightly worse than the &quot;regular&quot; (non-hunter) versions of the S4 one-handers.

<br />
<br />
There IS a point, did you actually look at the stats?<br />
Compared to normal S4 one hander, those hunter versions have the same dps but lose 2crit rating and 7armor penetration but win +2resi and +4ap which is exactly what hunters need, let's say compared to a warrior.<br />
So they ARE better than normal S4 one-hander for hunters.<br />
<br />
Also about the waraxe, of course there's better stats on a 2hander than 2 one-hander, compare S3 waraxe to 2 S3 one hander and the waraxe end up with far better stats. But still most hunters will take the S3 one-handers because +60int &gt; +35agi.<br />
Finally about the 2050 rating, They put that rating because they want S4 to be more difficult to get, and I wouldn't be surprised if they also put a 2050 rating on S4 waraxe.</div></div><hr />

You trade:<br />
<br />
+4 Resilience<br />
+8 AP<br />
-4 Crit Rating<br />
- 14 Armor Penetration<br />
<br />
I guess it's a preference thing, but the Armor Penetration is better than the Resilience. AP and Crit are equal, with a slight nudge to Crit. So basically, the regular S4 weapons are slightly better.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and there is no S4 Two-hander for Hunters, like the S3 Two-Hander. So there's no other option for low-rated Hunters.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anonymont</div><div class="date">2008-05-02, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is indeed a preference thing but for me, armor penetration is not better than resilience, if you looked at some arenas hunters with high rating, you would see a lot of them have like 1 or 2 10resilience gems, this is because a hunter set doesn't have that much resilience compared to some others set in the first place and also since rogue and warriors hurt a lot more than in S2, a hunter can be down pretty fast nowadays.<br />
And as for AP and crit, it's more because any hunter can easily have 31% crit or more while having as few as 1600 unbuffed, so I'd say that ap is slightly better than crit since they have enough crit already.<br />
<br />
As for no S4 waraxe, I didn't know, but it's fair since any hunter worth his salt would take 2 one-handers anyway, and if you want an easy no rating weapon, S3 waraxe is still a good enough pick.<br />
<br />
And as for Spell Haste rating. You cannot compare one haste point to one damage, it's retard, if you want to compare anything, you compare 227haste to 266damage.<br />
Anyway like it's been said, the biggest problem with haste is that it make your spells cost more mana compared to +damage. And yes, having haste can mean getting one frostbolt out that you couldn't have cast normally, but it can also mean you could have normally cast it, and then it's a waste of damage and mana.<br />
Anyway what possibly could happen is, casters will take both, and change weapon on the spot, like a /equip haste weapon + forstbolt or manaburn macro. And you could also use it to resurrect people faster I guess ;)</div></div><hr />

Good hunters have 2 sets of weapons. 1 (the Axe) is used with Savagery/35 Agi (most of the time Agi). The second set of weapons are 2 1-handers that have +30 Intellect on them. With Aspect of the Viper + 60 intellect from the 2 1 handers, you can run at about 1000-1500 mana forever without really ever running out (especially now with 2.4.2 buffing Viper) - unless of course you go apeshit or get drained. <br />
<br />
Typically in Druid/Hunter or Hunter + Outlast/Drain teams the Hunter sacrifices the extra AP/Crit/Everything else in order to not have to worry about mana. In burst situations they will macro the Axe with AP Aspect in order to dps something down.. then macro back to the Viper + 2 1 Handers.<br />
<br />
So, there is/was definitely a reason for these.. I would even liked to have seen +20 Intellect or something on them in the place of armor ignore or some other stat (except stamina/resilience).<br />
<br />
I HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH:<br />
<br />
Are the new Guardian things purchased with Honor points or with Arena points? I can't seem to find that answer.. and it seems odd that they require an Arena rating for something you have to farm BGs for?</div></div><hr />

While I understand casters dont get 6K armor, ive always been a little upset that they have no requirement on thier off hand pvp item, or their wand either. While pallys and shammys have to get a decent rating to get access to their shield, and get a libram / totem that most would trade for stats on the wands anyways. <br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

More like prioritizing. Whats more important, a patch or a expansion? Wotk is a big project and like any game or expansion the public wants it asap.<br />

Mage - Pom , IB <br />
Shaman - NW, Shields 0mana restore mana , totems up the ass <br />

If blizzard gave a shit too save this game b4 ( age of conan ) comes out its about fucking time to finally make it happen.<br />
Back in the day at level 60 it was pure skill that you used to fight and encounter Pve/Pvp now all you need is some gear and ur Op abilitys<br />

Many old school players must admit that 60 Pre tbc was 5 x better than Tbc in some factors . <br />

P.S None cares what your gear is, or your progress in the game. The minute u enter ur username and password you are on your own. I guess this is just another &quot;kids&quot; forum or something, like the ones in AV and WSG who farm honor without having a clue how to complete the game with victory.<br />
<br />
I expect a serious answer from people who really can estimate the date of S4 coming in up. Answers like &quot;fu u noob&quot; and &quot;l2p&quot; and other &quot;1337&quot; responses will just past ignored. Seen lots of those the past 2 years in this game!<br />

<br />
<br />
Not entirely true for some uses and specs. Not all jobs run on the same multipliers or are affected by others multiplier boosts. In raid with raid debuffs/buffs going the S2 gavel/dagger can outrun the S4 spell haste gavel/dagger for 30/21/10 warlock, 40/0/10+10 warlock, deep arcane mage and spriest with ease. That's like saying Warlock T4 &lt; T5 because it's T5. Doesn't work that way unless you're 0/21/40.</div></div><hr />

no, many people wants shiny armors in WOTLK and also shiny armors in BC... They get enough money to handle both and bullshit about focused effort on WOTLK is just a bullshit</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enough money perhaps, but maybe not enough gamedesigners and artists to create this marvelous gear looks. They might not be able to find more with enough experience and skill to do it!<br />
<br />
I hope that the problem with this ugly armors is that they are focusing on WOTLK.. S4 looks shit :&lt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Froppy</div><div class="date">2008-05-05, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone stated before:<br />
<br />
Prior to TBC (which arguably may or may not be a &quot;larger&quot; expansion than WotLK) Naxx came out (if I remember correctly, about 6 months prior to) and they had T3 items (again, some people think it is the best set). We are probably 6 months out before WotLK, and no real decent set. <br />
<br />
Secondly... if they are reusing T3 for T7/8 like they've said they are... how many more designers do they need?<br />
<br />
And.. finally.. I could be dead wrong here, but don't they approve and do a lot of the artwork at the beginning of development process? I always thought they made a major portion of the artwork prior to almost being completed and then just update as they need to. This is a lot fuzzier for me.<br />
<br />
I think they is a need for WotLK.. sure. But I bet some of it is related to the buyouts and the upper management restricting things like payroll spending to maintain a certain profit margin. I can hear a top guy saying &quot;We don't need another 10 designers, who cares they are just models.. just reuse and recolor old models and tell them we are using all our designers for WotLK... it'll make them more excited about the expansion.. AND we won't have to hire more&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, pure speculation, I just think it's a convenient excuse. We'll only know when WotLK comes out... if the art is amazing.. I'll believe them. If it's mediocre... someone is a money whore!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Thats my point.<br />
<br />
It's true that they'll be reusing the arts of t3 and so on, but thats not the only instance we'll see in WoLK! Blizzard has also confirmed that Naxx is not gonna be the hardest instance in WoLK, but one of the starter and easier ones. Besides that, models arent the only thing game designers can do ;)<br />
<br />
If it has come unnoticed, Blizzard are currently spending a lot of money on other development sections as well, such as Starcraft 2 and (MAYBE) diablo 3 ???? MAYBE also a whole new MMORPG ????<br />
<br />
All I can say is, theres a reason for blizzard not making these armors shiny.. It isn't like Blizzard to slack.</div></div><hr />

So this has probably been asked and I'm sorry if I'm asking the same crap as everyone else, but I couldn't find an answer while skimming. When it says no rating requirements for S4 Off-Hand, does it mean Off-Hand as in Totem, Libram, Throwing Weapon, Etc., or is it really something like Brutal Gladiator's Quickblade?<br />
<br />
<br />
PC: CTRL+F. Type in: Off hand / totem /libram /throwing weapon <br />
Mac: APPLE+F. Type in: Off hand / totem /libram /throwing weapon<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
pretty sure that you use spells that do no damage in pve.<br />
<br />
also pretty sure that dot dps not increasing with haste is pretty important in pve.<br />
<br />
also pretty sure that there are fights that require you to move, so long cast spells being shorter is important.<br />
<br />
The only thing i shouldnt have said is 'like you could do in pve', because its really pretty much subjective all the time.<br />
<br />

<br />
cost 650 each according to http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/april/s4_itemprices.jpg<br />
<br />
That's 1300 arena points. 300 more from what you would pay for the Vengeful axe (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34014)<br />
<br />
The price is fine with me, hey, if they want to make brutal more expensive than Vengeful i really don't care... but this shit is wierd!<br />
<br />
The 2 S4 axes together have:<br />
<br />
+62 sta<br />
+40 crit<br />
+28 resi<br />
+18 hit<br />
+84 ap<br />
+84 armor red<br />

My first post on the forum btw, so hi everyone. :-)<br />
<br />
<br />
to quote myself:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good hunters have 2 sets of weapons. 1 (the Axe) is used with Savagery/35 Agi (most of the time Agi). The second set of weapons are 2 1-handers that have +30 Intellect on them. With Aspect of the Viper + 60 intellect from the 2 1 handers, you can run at about 1000-1500 mana forever without really ever running out (especially now with 2.4.2 buffing Viper) - unless of course you go apeshit or get drained. <br />
<br />
Typically in Druid/Hunter or Hunter + Outlast/Drain teams the Hunter sacrifices the extra AP/Crit/Everything else in order to not have to worry about mana. In burst situations they will macro the Axe with AP Aspect in order to dps something down.. then macro back to the Viper + 2 1 Handers.<br />
<br />
So, there is/was definitely a reason for these.. I would even liked to have seen +20 Intellect or something on them in the place of armor ignore or some other stat (except stamina/resilience).<br />
<br />

<br />
super frustrating that Shields are both off-hand items and then also considered in the weapon class... I can't auto-swing my shield!<br />
<br />
so the thinking is the current 1850 rating for S3 will not be lowered? ouch, I really hope it falls in the off-hand classification</div></div><hr />

Course if you could swing 2050 rating I think the mainhand would be a prime target for prot pally tanking too. I was hoping to get a sweet upgrade for the sunwell shield without hitting BT yet :)</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I mean ,,Vindicator'' (wrist, waist, feets), not ,,Vengeful''. Now I have enough honor, but if Vindicators won't dissapear I can buy it for less honor in S4, so I'll wait. But if it dissapear, my honor will be for nothing, coz S4 honor stuff ,,Guardians'' will need Personal Rating, so its rly important for me.. and what about Isignia - I read here that will be new for 40K honor :o.

Thats what im saying. Most people want new content. Meaning no ones complaining if WotK is released on time instead of being delayed so they can make some armor sets for a side game which by the way most people wont be wearing for some time..</div></div><hr />
