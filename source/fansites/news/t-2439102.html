There are new playable races that cover every single race on Alliance side.<br />
<br />
Paladin are the only missing class on new races Horde side. This wouldn't matter if Zandalari didn't already have tons of paladin lore and their reasoning was something as simple as &quot;Rezan is dead, so we can't be paladins anymore&quot;. The whole idea of it is insulting for good reason, not to mention that Horde currently have two fewer options than Alliance.<br />
<br />
Blizzard should just add paladins for Zandalari. This is getting to be ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Draenei, Dwarf, DI, Pandaren and Kul'Tiran as Shaman options can't really be compared to Hordies only having little twig boy elves or stupidly giant tauren as their paladin options.

Nope it is not invalid here let us calculate shall we?<br />
<br />
Shaman class:<br />
<br />
Horde: Troll, Orc, Tauren, Mag'har, Goblin, Highmountain, Pandaren<br />
<br />
Alliance: Draenei, Dwarf, Dark Iron Dwarf.<br />
<br />
Paladin Class:<br />
<br />
Horde: Blood elf, and Tauren.<br />
<br />
Alliance: Human, Dwarf, Dark Iron Dwarf, Draenei, Lightforged Draenei.<br />
<br />
So yeah is that invalid for you?<br />

<br />
Please don't say stuff like Zandalari troll don't have Rezan so no lore for paladin so they can't be paladin.<br />
<br />
Tauren have a lot of lore as paladin? in Cataclysm expansion paladin class became available for Tauren with zero lore reasons so please stop the lore stuff thingy because if Blizzard want to make any race (insert class) they can. They are not forced to put lore reason behind any class combination.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, basically, you're proving his point.<br />
The Alliance has 5 races that can be paladins while the Horde only has 2 but the Horde has 6 races that can be shamans while the Alliance only has 3, is the same difference of 3 races in both cases. As originally paladins were Alliance only and Shaman Horde only, I do not see any problem in how things are at the moment, but I believe that if the Zandalari got paladins the Kul Tirans will receive shamans to keep the balance.<br />
<br />
Interesting fact, ignoring Kul Tirans and Zandalari that we are still not sure of the classes that they can be and Pandaren that is equal for both sides, follows a list of combos between race and class currently existing within the game:<br />
<br />
Equal on both sides:<br />
Hunter - A = 9 / H = 9<br />

<br />
My main point was about the Zandalari if they can't be paladin then yes Alliance will have more classes for their races than Horde. I was talking about paladin class specifically here and how Horde must have one more paladin class race which must be Zandalari but I guess you didn't even read my post in the first place eh?<br />
<br />
I know about the origin of paladin class being for Alliance only and Shaman only for the Horde. I was playing during classic and I was human paladin.</div></div><hr />

You cannot include Panderan for horde and not count them for alliance as well. That mean Ally has 4 shamans vs the hordes 6, meaning the disparity for paladin is greater.</div></div><hr />

If he did, Horde has 7 Shamans - not including the upcoming Zandalari (Pandaren, Orc, Mag'har Orc, Troll, Tauren, Highmountain Tauren, and Goblin).<br />
<br />
I feel like they could definitely add Kul'Tirans and possibly Night Elves as Paladins if they want to also create Zandalari Paladins. If they did that, Horde would have one fewer Paladin than Alliance has Shamans (3H vs 4A), but Horde would have 1 more Shaman than Alliance has Paladins (8H vs 7A). That would bring about an even class/race distribution between Shamans and Paladins combined on each side to 11 : 11</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alliance has now 4 shaman choices with Dark Irons getting them and there is high possibility that Kul'Tirans will get shaman too. While Horde eithrer can pick Tauren, and a lot of people aren't fan of being this big or elf, and most of old school Horde players dislike them a lot.<br />
<br />
Zandalari brings something new to the table and their Prelates have nothing to do with human/ draenei stuff. This is why they're so anticipated because they're original, got no ties to anything. And bring out new exotic theme. <br />
<br />
Also, this is a proof Prelates are doing fine in 8.1 Rezan was just one of many loas, true he was the strengest but even Shadra was able to grant light-based powers.<br />

The paladin community will be butthurt and cry. Just annoying to see people bitch and cry.<br />
<br />
It's really annoying to see people make predictions about things they really don't know anything about. The truth is, you don't know what's going to happen and you're just lying.<br />
<br />
We have been wishing for it. There are precedents of Trolls wielding the Light. Ion Hazzikostas left the door WIDE OPEN, and nearly hinted at it. There are many clues and indicators of a strong chance of it happening.<br />
<br />
What do you have other than a shit attitude and a fake crystal ball?</div></div><hr />

What do you have other than a shit attitude and a fake crystal ball?Do you always speak out your ass or just enjoy being a hypocrite. You literally said you hate when people make predictions yet that is exactly what you are doing. Im not making a prediction, Im simply stating my opinion on my feelings toward people who cry and complain about things they don't get. smh. Try harder kid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, because saying &quot;Once they find out they aren't getting Zandalari Paladins&quot; is totally not talking out of your ass. And no, you were being a douche to people who want the race/class combo. Your opinion on your feelings, huh? wut?<br />
<br />
Why try harder when I've already succeeded in what I set out to do.<br />
<br />
Cheers to you when we get Zandalari Paladins.</div></div><hr />
