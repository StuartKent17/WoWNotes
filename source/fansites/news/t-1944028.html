Legion - Rogue Tier 19<br />

There haven't been any changes to Lunar Festival since last year. <br />

<br />
Healing Design in Legion<br />
Thanks for all the feedback. A few things:<br />
<br />
1) It's definitely still intended that you consider mana costs in choosing heals. I wouldn't agree with the characterization that any changes (recent or otherwise) reflect an abandonment of this. It's widely accepted among players that mana became overly abundant at high ilvls in past expansions, which did in some cases undermine the resource management aspect. But the spell selections of each class are still made with the intention of mana being an important factor. They are in Legion just as they have been in the past, with the main change being to avoid having mana grow excessively generously throughout the expansion. Jumping ahead, trinkets are indeed one place where we may provide opporunities to invest in more mana. But mana regen will not be passively increasing by a large amount simply due to gear advancement, largely for these reasons.<br />
<br />
6) Tranquility and Divine Hymn should still deliver significantly more healing than those players would typically do in 8 seconds. Having these sorts of spells (both the channeled and instant varieties) do &quot;significantly more&quot; than usual, as opposed to the overwhelming strength they have on live, might take some getting used to. But there is no reason they won't be strong and helpful spells to use either at specific high-damage encounter moments or simply because the player needs to catch up in a bad healing situation. In both of these cases, the intention is that the cooldowns don't completely supplant the normal healing gameplay, but give a boost to output at a key moment. On Tranquility and Divine Hymn in particular, the 8-second channel causes the biggest problem in the dungeon context, and both of these spells will do increased healing outside of raids to account for that.<br />
<br />
The Aura talent row, Aura mastery spell, and corresponding artifact trait are all reworked in an upcoming patch. Among other things, we agree the trait giving Aura Mastery the effect of all three Auras eliminates too much of the significance of the talent choice.<br />
<br />
7) We understand the importance of utility. I want to point out that on live, the dominance of Disc Priest and Paladin in the highest-level raiding is primarily due to their core healing function and not to unique non-healing utility (exception in some cases for Hand of Protection, but the removal of Clemency from all specs in Legion reduces that problem significantly). Avoiding a repeat situation where some healers feel left out of the most optimized Mythic healing groups is likely a question of balancing the actual heals, not of more incidental utility buttons such as Wind Rush, Tiger's Lust, Innervate and so on.<br />
<br />
The artifact trait granting a 5% haste aura will also be changed before Holy Paladin is playable on alpha.<br />
<br />
To illustrate with numbers: if 100 DPS is incoming and you have to choose between spending a little bit of mana to do 50 HPS, a medium amount of mana to do 125 HPS, or a large amount of mana to do 200 HPS, the correct choice is 125 HPS, but then every 5th second there's nothing to heal. All I am saying is that healers should be able to do something meaningful in this 5th second.<br />
Note that even in your example, you could instead spend every 3rd second on your 50 HPS heal, and save a little mana over your solution (that never uses that heal and instead fills every 5th second with DPS). In any situation where healing and mana are a significant challenge, that gameplay is still present, and toolkits with different spells of varying efficiency provide opportunity for more skilled healers to know when and how much to use the cheaper options.<br />
<br />
On 7) While I agree that HFC's healer composition issues stemmed largely from actual healing issues, I still think that more effort can be put towards ensuring that every healer has things they can do that are useful and &quot;cool&quot; beyond filling health bars. Similar to the above, it is less about power and more that it feels bad to be asked to justify why your spec should be brought when another spec brings X ability and not have an answer. Currently I think that HPriest/Druid/MW all have difficulty answering that question and while it may not matter much to people that have a good understanding of the entire healing picture, this topic holds a lot of sway when it comes to the general community's opinions on balance.<br />
Again, nobody's denying the value of utility abilities that are fun to use (defined as you did in the OP as things other than healing output or equivalent shielding/damage-reduction). Merely trying to avoid conflating it with major healer balance concerns. To your point, even the Disc Priest in Warlords didn't justify being brought by some X factor that raid leaders had to have, other than their sheer volume of healing/shielding. Their extras like Body and Soul were comparatively minor. Similarly, something like Wind Rush isn't intended to dominate the importance of actual healing when deciding what classes or individuals to bring to a raid, and we'll examine it closely if it does. It likely won't, as it's somewhat weaker than the live spell Stampeding Roar (which hasn't had such an effect)--much smaller radius and no snare break (also a 2min cooldown which I believe you haven't seen yet).<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Any plans for something like the Lorewalker quests in Legion? One of my favorite parts of Pandaria <br />
Thank you! We loved those. There's lots of custom storytelling for artifacts this time around, but no 'Lorewalker' equivalent (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/692824076889395200))<br />

Glyph if stars is why Im a moonkin. And glyph if shadows is why my priest wears a bikini.&gt;_&gt;<br />
The Glyph of Stars visual effect (along with a matching Solar variant) is used for the Blessing of the Ancients (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/202360-blessing-of-the-ancients) talent. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/692530008158527489))<br />

but Light of the Martyr (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/183998-light-of-the-martyr)? At 12.5% of total mana, seems expensive for such a small net gain in healing. Will have to wait and see.<br />
In addition to being a no-cooldown instant spell, the healing of LotM is increased by Crit and Mastery (while the damage is not). (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/692529577286078464))<br />
However, one change that didn't make it into this build's data is that LotM will no longer flow through Beacon of Light. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/692529673205604352))<br />

Forums have a tendency toward negativity, so I always take feedback with salt and pepper. But this level of uniformity is unusual.<br />
Where is this feedback? I'm seeing virtually none so far. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/692817248130613249))<br />
This thread in particular gets off to a poor start, but has some helpful posts in it: https://t.co/EY8ztY4d9S<br />
.Oh. Reminder: Please post Alpha feedback in the Alpha forums. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/692817662578184192))<br />
Yeah, w/ rogue stuff at least, I've seen a tendency for people to vent where they feel comfortable. (And less moderated, maybe.)<br />
Venting is fine, but we do also want to get good, useful feedback. Another reminder: Tuning hasn't happened. Ignore numbers. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/692820459553972224))<br />
this issue is far far from a tuning issue. The spec has been gutted and simplified to be utter garbage<br />
Then I look forward to reading your good feedback! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/692826155121053696))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
I hope your empathy improved since the &quot;WoW Dungeons are Hard&quot; article. ⊙︿⊙<br />
That's why I wrote that article! Players were frustrated and confused about our intentions. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/690429622480158721))<br />
I thought (&amp; still do) that using more of your class abilities and coordinating with your party was more fun and memorable. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/690430222655713281))<br />
But that didn't resonate with some players coming off of overgearing LK dungeons for valor runs. So we pivoted. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/690430544258052096))<br />
Was that the right choice? Players have been debating that topic ever since. ) (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/690430686927405057))<br />
I do think I have become more empathetic over time though. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/690430775347539968))<br />

<br />
Not excited about this. I like the updated moonkin models, but I like not using it more. Especially with what t19 for druids looks like. Now would be a great time to put in a minor glyph that allows us to stay as our race while in moonkin form and just apply the buff (you know, since they only added moonkin in because balance was the only druid spec in vanilla that lacked an animal form).</div></div><hr />

As someone who played 10 years with 250ms-500ms latency (before Oceanic servers), I took it as 'a latency joke' not a 'hunter joke'.<br />

Check the date on those tweets. They're from his Twitter Q&amp;A literally WEEKS ago, so are all of the other tweets you see on frontpage MMO-C news. It's not new at all, somehow they just want to only post a few at a time for reasons unknown to me. Stirring the pot, maybe?<br />

<br />
It's one of the avenues to give feedback to the devs. Anyone who doesn't have access to the alpha can't post on the alpha forums. Maybe you should use some common sense before claiming a tweet is needless whining.</div></div><hr />

As for GC..... I (as well as others) bitched about this a few weeks ago. APPARENTLY at some point (a long fking time ago when he was still kind of relevant) MMOC had poll (that I can't find) that decided to keep posting them. The need to run that poll again, i'm sure it would be different as a bunch of people are sick of seeing shit from a Dev that left years ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't quote me on this, but it says the effect remains as part of the Blessing of Ancients talent... and looking at the talent, it does not mention duration...<br />
<br />
So I'm thinking, maybe you go into moonkin form, then hit the talent to activate Stars form. Then hit it again to switch the talent effect and get Solar form. <br />
<br />
Hopefully they don't just make it Astral Moonkin and Solar Moonkin...<br />

Apprently they are 'redesigning the glyph system' which from what we've seen/heard simply equates to removing a bunch of glyphs and baking their effects into talents/abilities (no complaints from me on most of that mind you). NFI why they are removing cosmetic minor glyphs like this though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't quote me on this, but it says the effect remains as part of the Blessing of Ancients talent... and looking at the talent, it does not mention duration...<br />
<br />
So I'm thinking, maybe you go into moonkin form, then hit the talent to activate Stars form. Then hit it again to switch the talent effect and get Solar form. <br />
<br />
Hopefully they don't just make it Astral Moonkin and Solar Moonkin...<br />
<br />
If you click over too replies of the initial tweet itself, Ian Bates (RedShirtGuy) has tested it on the alpha &quot;Just checked, you are indeed stuck as a moonkin. The talent gives your moonkin form that effect.&quot; So a sparkly Owl :\</div></div><hr />

No there is no button for it, im sure there are some vid on youtube that showcase it. You click the talent and just pop into moonkin form and it gives you the glyph of stars look. My problem is that is tied to a talent in the first place, there are some fights where you might wanna change and therefore lose the astral glyph because of it.</div></div><hr />

You got a point. Didnt check dates, cause never opened the twitter page, as i simply dont like that site. <br />

As of the rogue set once more:<br />
I just realised what i like the most about the first version presented in the video.<br />
<br />
The eye-sockets arent glowing!!!<br />
Thats sinister, shady as it should be!<br />
<br />
too many neon designs nowadays imho. But the other version are good aswell. Just they are not the best in my opinion. :)</div></div><hr />

As for GC..... I (as well as others) bitched about this a few weeks ago. APPARENTLY at some point (a long fking time ago when he was still kind of relevant) MMOC had poll (that I can't find) that decided to keep posting them. The need to run that poll again, i'm sure it would be different as a bunch of people are sick of seeing shit from a Dev that left years ago.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry you feel that way. Some of us find it interesting to see:<br />
<br />
&gt; insights into past development practices and decisions affecting WoW, as these definitely influence decisions today (positively or negatively)<br />
&gt; other views into development in general (either his time at Blizzard, Ensemble, or current tenure at Riot)<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but unless you know-a-guy-who-knows-a-guy in the game industry, this kind of candid talk is rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Without a doubt the best thing going on for rogues in Legion is that set.<br />
Which is kind of weird since we haven't gotten a decent looking tier sets in like 10 years.<br />
<br />
The artifacts are near all horrible, few assassination ones go with the tier set, others garbage.<br />
Outlaw becoming pirates, worst idea ever, although the balancing is not done, the spec speed is so slow.<br />

Literally every word the OP, and then people responding about it, considering healer utility is so incredibly important and spot on and MUST! be paid attention to by Blizzard.

I haven't played this game for all of WoD because im a resto druid that does nothing but throw heals.

<br />
&quot;Spot on!&quot;<br />
<br />
Really fits the rogue motif. For a long time I haven't seen such 'roguish' armor sets, in particular the first two.<br />
Shoulders aren't so bulky; the dark colours and the smoke; the chest's texture resembling daggers; the mask and hood emphasizing the inherent aggressiveness of rogues (kinda looks like those creepy creatures in LOTR, doesn't it?), although the blue set armor's head reminds me of mages perhaps because of the golden fringe?<br />
All in all, very good!</div></div><hr />

Yup. I liked being able to change the appearance of my armor, and not look like a friggin laz0r chiken. If they actually take this away, I'll either A) always be using that talent, regardless of how bad it is, or B) I won't be playing balance. Superficial? Sure.

I didn't see that one but I did just see a response from Lore on the official forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20420604672?page=3#45)<br />
<br />
So, to clear the air a bit, here’s our current plan:<br />
-Glyph of Stars will be a minor glyph for Moonkin Form, which gives it the same Astral Form effect as on live (where you stay in caster form with a blue translucent visual).<br />
-The Blessing of the Ancients buffs will have lunar/solar visuals that apply to your current form (whether it be humanoid or Moonkin).<br />
-We’re still discussing on how the coloring effects will work if you have both Glyph of Stars and Blessing of the Ancients.<br />

This. I asked for a refund for the Digital Deluxe for Legion last night- got it refunded today.<br />
<br />
I am holding out hope that Legion will blow me away. But I am putting the ball in Blizzard's court and making the decision to play Legion only after the first fiscal quarter after it is released. We still are not seeing any proof Blizzard intends to give us a complete expansion and trusting them to do so again would be foolish as hell.<br />
<br />
I fully expect them to market the bejezus out of Legion, get their windfall of expansion sales and the first few months of subs racked in and then start hinting they have to work on the next expansion. &quot;If you want the new, better expansion, you cannot expect us to create major patches for Legion. We told a great story in Legion.. blah, blah, blah.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reading the same nonsense, PR Blue Posts and smug, smartass CM Tweets, combined with the reversal concerning refunds with the Digital Deluxe if you purchased the CE, I just gave up for now. <br />
<br />
I am thinking of locking toons at 80, 85, and 90 and finding other similar players to run dungeons and raids a couple nights a week until my sub runs out again.</div></div><hr />
