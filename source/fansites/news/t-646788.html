Nezoia but there is little different betwenn geting paid for job and earning money from playing games. Maybe they re not earning xxx euro per month, but every interview with em, every e-sport even in which they take part means money dont u get it?<br />

I want to know how you know all this stuff. I've heard all about these guys getting paid etc. I never really though much about it but it seems to bother a lot of people. Are you saying they get products for being pro gamers? Like do they get computers, mouse pads and stuff like that? That makes sense. I've just never really heard them talk about getting paid to play. I know when some of these guys were in Nihilum, I'm pretty sure mouse sports gave them some free gear.<br />
<br />
I think it's pretty cool no matter what how fast they finish bosses. It's amazing how quickly they beat Hodir considering the buffs to the fight. When i say quick here I mean the time the encounter took (in minutes). It's just really fun to see someone playing at the top of the their game. It's even more cool because a lot of us are doing the same encounters and the benchmark they provide is dumbfounding in my opinion. Not only do they dedicate massive amounts of time to the game for a few weeks while they finish the new dungeon they also are incredibly skilled at the game. On top of that just knowing all those class mechanics and having such a deep knowledge of WoW is very interesting.<br />
<br />
I enjoy following them and reading what everyone has to say about it.</div></div><hr />

m8 its rly not bothering me coz tbh i dont care bout them. Generaly i like that they do coz as i said that's perfect way for life if u like it. Only thing that i dont like is their merge coz they left no true competition. But trust me that some photoshots or interviews ar not for free. Reporters got to pay some for their time and thats how they get some money. Same with participating in some e-sport events. its ideantical as for skaters. They ar not paid, but they earn by winning some contets, by taking part in TV shots ect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty easy. There is a thing called talent ;). Just some people ar way better in some thing than other. And ofc that WoW doesnt need any kind of skill like shooters or RPGs needs so the only hard thing in wow is fast reaction and ability concluse possible strategy after seeing boss abilities on wipe. Its pretty sad but a lot of Wow players seems to lack that obvious human ability :&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's going to take even longer for a lot of the top guilds to get there now. Blizz buffed the difficulty of a lot of the keeper's hard modes while nerfing the normal modes. <br />
<br />
They also used an exploit to get Hodir's hard mode down and even then they &quot;just&quot; barely got it. So it will be a good while before you can get raid dps stacked as high as it needs to go. 40k dps from mages with a spell stolen buff really does help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah it has nothing to do with a large amount of spare time, having a guild full of players that WILL dedicate their time full to WoW when needed or that driven need for epeen.<br />
<br />
Sure they're talented but hell, try finding such a large group of players who are willing to commit so much time to the game. You basically can't commit yourself full time to anything in real life.<br />
<br />
I personally don't give a monkeys about world firsts. Good for them and everything (like they can see us saying congrats and even caring), but why should I praise them for doing something they get fame and money out of for playing a game? It's EXACTLY like praising Paris Hilton for being rich and famous for bugger all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hothgor</div><div class="date">2009-05-01, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Note: This is not a comment intended to 'hate' on Ensidia, more so, this is directed at Blizzard themselves.<br />
<br />
First off, congrats to Ensidia on taking down Mimiron and getting to Algalon!! I'm certain that you guys have worked very hard to reach this goal, and that you are looking forward to owning Algalon up in the coming days/weeks. But some things need to be said.<br />
<br />
Ensidia cheated/cheesed Hodir.<br />
<br />
Sure, this was an oversight on Blizzards part in three ways. First, that you could spell steal the flower power buff in the first place - what were they thinking! 'Bugs' like these - along with messed up XT trash, charge+meleeing Ignis and other encounters really hit the US guilds hard this go around. These same bugs were hot fixed before the European servers even got a crack at Ulduar - leading to some highly skewed world kill rankings in favor of Europe. I don't expect every bug to be caught by Blizzard on the PTR, but the QA team really dropped the ball this time!!!<br />
<br />
Second, that they made the Hodir fight pretty much IMPOSSIBLE even with full Ulduar gear. Ensidia themselves admitted to this on their guild webpage. Blizzard needs to do the right thing and 'nerf' this boss to make it a reasonable fight for those of us who chose NOT to flower power it down. <br />
<br />
Lastly, Blizzard seems to be applying hot fixes at a MUCH faster rate to European servers than American servers. In fact, the American Mimiron encounter is still way to short to be completed - even if you only bring 1 tank and 2-3 healers! Hot fixes either need to be implemented at the same time for BOTH raiding zones, or not until the following Tuesday to at least give the majority of the guilds a chance to duplicate each others success.<br />
<br />
Constantly changing the rules of the game - often in the MIDDLE of a boss fight - helps no one and frustrates many!!<br />
<br />
In a way, I feel sorry for Ensidia. Their Ulduar Algalon achievement could potentially be tarnished forever due to the use of a bug to exploit the Hodir encounter. If I were them, I'd destroy the quest item and do it the legitimate way along with the rest of the world than deal with doubters until 3.2 comes out...</div></div><hr />

no, because it was hotfixed right after, which usually mean it's not intended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm still torn on the Hodir kill. Blizzard should have not changed the boss encounter mid race like they did, but at the same time Ensidia probably should not have used a method to kill Hodir that is now not available to the next guild that tries him Hardmode. I still think it was amazing that they were able to kill Hodir in that amount of time though. I think it would be a good idea for them to defeat Hodir next week on hardmode without &quot;flower power&quot;. They would still get the extra hour on Algalon this week that some other guilds might not receive, but for the trouble they went though to kill Hodir, I think it is deserved.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cents</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phenomina</div><div class="date">2009-05-01, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds similar to the mage glitch that would allow 1 mage to solo the entire Military Quarter. Sure it could be done but it was not intended, therefore it's a exploit.<br />
<br />
It's a shame during the great things this guild accomplish's so many other conflicting cheat accusitions seem to surface as well. ie. Lady Vashj :'(</div></div><hr />

<br />
But paris hilton can't beat mimiron hard mode. Thus the &quot;talent&quot; comment. Would you scoff in the face of an olympic gold medalist simply because they spend all of their free time training toward winning the olympics? How is this any different?<br />
<br />
On a side note, it's already been posted in this thread that they don't get payed to play.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Weenietot</div><div class="date">2009-05-01, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is simply clever use of game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Isn't that the definition of an exploit?<br />
<br />
Whatever. Good for them? I guess? I've seen people with worse claims to fame.<br />
<br />
And they never said they don't get paid. They just don't get paid enough to live off the proceeds. <br />
<br />
I just don't believe the claim that the time to play like they do is 'not that much'. Sure, a month before 3.1, they were sitting around picking their noses, but when 3.1 hit, I bet they dropped their lives to world first. Premo was raiding for at least 12 hours on day one (from server up that Tuesday to server down for maintenance that next morning). I highly doubt the same doesn't apply to Ensidia.<br />

They wouldn't have gotten to algalon because Blizzard decided to lower Hodir's hardmode timer to a level where it simply isn't possible even in full BIS gear in a stacked raidgroup, all because one of the best guilds in the world managed to kill him on his old timer in week one and they panicked.<br />
Blizzard are mainly to blame for this with their knee-jerk balance changes, but even so Ensidia still exploited something that was patched out very quickly afterwards.</div></div><hr />

Funnily, two of his three posts are in this thread. ::)<br />
<br />
However, using spellsteal to get a buff is not cheating. Karatechop &amp; Pals using Martin Fury to kill bosses = cheating.<br />
<br />
Blizzard made the dps requirements to Hardmode Hodir &quot;impossible&quot; to reach. This was AFTER some guild had already done it with the old timer. It's clear that they didn't want guilds doing 25-man hardmodes yet.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, they should have left Hodir as it was because it was already done, giving that guild an unfair advantage in the Algalon race after the timer was made harder to beat. Ensidia got creative, and props for them for that.<br />
<br />
Blizzard already made one mistake with this encounter, if they want to do the right thing, they keep &quot;Flower Power&quot; spellstealable, OR even better, restore the old hardmode timer.</div></div><hr />

How can you be so incredibly daft? <br />
<br />
To get to Algalon you must kill all 4 keepers on their hardmode. Ensidia is the first guild in the world to do this, so in essence saying you're the first guild to reach Algalon is the same as saying you're the first guild to beat those 4 hardmodes.<br />

Sure they're talented but hell, try finding such a large group of players who are willing to commit so much time to the game. You basically can't commit yourself full time to anything in real life.<br />

I personally don't give a monkeys about world firsts.

<br />
First off, congrats to Ensidia on taking down Mimiron and getting to Algalon!! I'm certain that you guys have worked very hard to reach this goal, and that you are looking forward to owning Algalon up in the coming days/weeks. But some things need to be said.<br />
<br />
Ensidia cheated/cheesed Hodir.<br />
<br />
Sure, this was an oversight on Blizzards part in three ways. First, that you could spell steal the flower power buff in the first place - what were they thinking! 'Bugs' like these - along with messed up XT trash, charge+meleeing Ignis and other encounters really hit the US guilds hard this go around. These same bugs were hot fixed before the European servers even got a crack at Ulduar - leading to some highly skewed world kill rankings in favor of Europe. I don't expect every bug to be caught by Blizzard on the PTR, but the QA team really dropped the ball this time!!!<br />
<br />
Second, that they made the Hodir fight pretty much IMPOSSIBLE even with full Ulduar gear. Ensidia themselves admitted to this on their guild webpage. Blizzard needs to do the right thing and 'nerf' this boss to make it a reasonable fight for those of us who chose NOT to flower power it down. <br />
<br />
Lastly, Blizzard seems to be applying hot fixes at a MUCH faster rate to European servers than American servers. In fact, the American Mimiron encounter is still way to short to be completed - even if you only bring 1 tank and 2-3 healers! Hot fixes either need to be implemented at the same time for BOTH raiding zones, or not until the following Tuesday to at least give the majority of the guilds a chance to duplicate each others success.<br />
<br />
Constantly changing the rules of the game - often in the MIDDLE of a boss fight - helps no one and frustrates many!!<br />
<br />
In a way, I feel sorry for Ensidia. Their Ulduar Algalon achievement could potentially be tarnished forever due to the use of a bug to exploit the Hodir encounter. If I were them, I'd destroy the quest item and do it the legitimate way along with the rest of the world than deal with doubters until 3.2 comes out...<br />
<br />
<br />
I bet your US guild waited to raid until european servers were up on 3.1 release? o w8</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, we just got bent over by having to do the 45 minute XT Trash Kite Clear - after giving up on the 3 'hot fixes' that was supposed to disable them - and Ignis Meleeing on Charges. Two things the Europeans didn't have to experience.</div></div><hr />

Did other top guilds who got Hodir hardmode down before he got buffed destroy the q item? Because I'm pretty sure that they said that they did it that way because blizz were shutting them out from Algalon because he'd been buffed after people had got the q item. By your logic, they should just delete their q items too, or do they not count as the rest of the world?</div></div><hr />

You should probably read my original post in which I discussed that the hot fixes in the middle of a boss fight isn't productive or helpful to anyone in the world. No one - not even the top guilds - cared that another guild got to Hodir or any other boss 'first'. What they do care about is the fact that after one guild succeeds on a boss, Blizzard buffs - or in this case 'fixes' - the hell out of it making it impossible for any other guild to do the same.</div></div><hr />

lol you get so mad because they killed hodir using a clever tactic. This u get mad because blizzard buffs a boss after they see its to easy. Well stop being a noob and get your guild to kill hodir with the flower power buff. Oh wait your guild is one of the best in the world so they dont do exploits.

Yeah, but I'm saying that Ensidia should only have to destroy their key due to morals if other guilds who got the key before blizz screwed it up by buffing him, did the same, which they didn't afaik. Your point was that Ensidia should destroy their keys to level it out; my point was that they shouldn't because other people who were in a similar situation didn't, thus levelling is impossible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hodir hardmode was not too easy before the change, 2:30 was a solid challenge without requiring bullshit raid stacking, the fact that blizzard decided to hamfistedly change this because one of the top guilds in the world made the timer in week 1 is stupid, and the fact that they trimmed it by a whole 30 seconds shows that either:<br />
a) they learned absolutely nothing from the Hodir hard-mode testing on the PTR and have no idea how to tune the encounter.<br />
b) it's a deliberate cockblock.<br />
<br />
Though judging by the way they continue to buff Freya and Mimiron to similarly retarded levels I'm leaning towards b.</div></div><hr />

Well, would they destroy it along with the other guilds who did Hodir when the timer was 2:30?<br />

Yes they exploited a bug, they have themselves admited that it was only because blizzard changed the rules for the fight in the middle of the race and if they wanted a shot at worlds first they had to do it to since the new 2 minute timer was impossible to beat.<br />
Method said the same and even congratulated Ensidia to the kill and inovative use of Flower Power.<br />

The guild woulnt be top in the world if they were not willing to utilise each and evry advantage to be tops.Sure their alot of grey areas but no action has been taken against em as far as i am concerned and despite evrythign they have proven themselves time and time again an extremely dedicated raiding guild that does all that is necessary to down a boss.<br />

<br />
<br />
hodir was/is a bugged, overtuned PoS boss. They did what they had to do, in order to get to the non-bugged bosses. They would have stomped all over hodir long before, if it had not been made impossible by careless/clueless overtuning. Look at it this way, they took that boss, showed him deep into the trashbin, and moved on. They themselves said that their Hodir kill should not be looked on as legitimate, but as a necessary &quot;get the fuck out of the way hodir&quot;, so they weren't disadvantaged by stupid design decisions.<br />
<br />
The whole point of them making a news post about it, was to show how retarded the boss is atm so Blizzard can fix it for all your clueless &quot;lol exploit -rep -rep!&quot; crybaby guilds.</div></div><hr />

For them to go, &quot;hrmm why don't we ditch all the sponsors and just have a good guild full of cool people that raids awesomely&quot; would be retarded on their behalf.<br />

What guilds like Ensidia do get paid, is travels and expenses (such as website hosting). When you see 5 people Nihilum in France (or 4, but I'm pretty sure Nessaj was there as well, I just didn't manage to find him), that's a trip that's most likely paid by their sponsor. (A long with free entry tickets to the show, by Blizzard).<br />
<br />
But getting paid for gaming? no, they don't get paid for that.<br />

They were mad, no, they were infuriated, that their content would be beaten so easily and that their real challenge, Algalon, would be defeated within a month of the original release. So they tuned encounters to be impossible untill they deem it time to un-nerf them for them. Mark my words, some of these buffs will be reverted.<br />

There is a difference between hard, nigh impossible and impossible.<br />
When you look at the fact that the people that did the encounter on the old timers and they get to keep their pride an honor about it, there's nothing wrong with that. Ensidia however, had to deal with the new timer, considering that world firsts are something everyone looks up to, they have their own ideals and thus they had to find a way to reroute themselves around the obstacle that was made impossible.

<br />
Well, yeh. It's becoming quite clear that the only reason for many of the hardmode buffs is to make them impossible; many of the buffs simply weren't needed as the hardmodes were undefeated anyway. There's at least 12 Ulduar achievements which have been deemed nigh-on impossible by these buffs, including the Algalon ones, and the drake meta. That's about 1/4 of the achievements. Needless to say, that won't last long.</div></div><hr />

NO THEY FUCKING DIDN'T. THAT'S THE POINT, THEY CHEATED, IF A BOSS IS IMPOSSIBLE TO KILL (AS IN IT'S OVERTUNED) IT'S OVERTUNED, IT'S UNKILLABLE, IT'S NOT A REASON TO CHEAT AND EXPLOIT FFS<br />

a guild comes to you and basically says &quot;We cheated, but it's only because you forced us to. Now that we've cheated our way into second place, please fix this so nobody else can do it.&quot; Do you honestly expect us not to take issue with this. We briefly considered using flower power to kill uptuned hardmodes weeks ago, but decided against it because not only is it a clear exploitation, but because we assumed that despite the haphazard, erratic, and irresponsible approach Blizzard has taken with this current progression cycle, our competitors would have as much integrity as we like to think we do.<br />

Talk to vodka, talk to the mages who get 24h bans and loot removed for spellstealing a buff in naxx. Why the fuck is there always exploit/cheating drama around ONE guild.. nihilum/ensidia.<br />

<br />
<br />
Like the mages who exploited the Military wing of Naxx kept it a secret...oh wait, they didn't. <br />
<br />
Here is the problem people. I will explain it as plainly and logically as I possibly can. They used mages to spell-steal a buff from the trash to Freya - a buff that should NEVER have been stolen in the first place - and used this buff to have their mages dish out 40k+ DPS on Hodir so that they could beat the hard mode timer. That was bad enough, but the icing on the cake was then publicly calling for Blizzard to FIX the bug AFTER they killed the boss and got their quest item - leaving them as the only guild in the world capable of attempting Algalon.<br />
<br />
But this is really much less about Ensidia cheating/cheesing an encounter and more about the fact that Blizzard pushed their guild into using the exploit by over tuning an encounter and making it impossible for it be done any legitimate way. Not only that, but most guilds already killed Hodir this week because he wasn't stated to be 'tweaked' on the forums like half the other bosses in the zone were.<br />
<br />
What I, and some of my friends are saying is: <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Asking to get the bug you used to get your quest item fixed is practically volunteering to get your sigil stripped, and the boss respawned, and thats what most high end raiders are half expecting Blizzard will do since it is probably the most fair to everyone.&quot;<br />
<br />
No one is crying that Ensidia is the first in the world to get to Algalon in the 25 man raiding tier. We are only complaining because they cheated - and admitted to cheating - to get there.<br />
<br />
And I will state this again: my guild KNEW about the exploit. We KNEW some guilds potentially did the Con-speed-atory achievement by using this bug, and speculated that people would stack mages to burn down Hodir - just like players did to cheese the Anub'rekan fight. We chose NOT to use it. Many other guilds also chose NOT to use it. One guild did not. And one guild is now on Algalon.<br />
<br />
That is all that needs to be said.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Highmitsu</div><div class="date">2009-05-02, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a choice you didn't make, alright, but now you're moaning about the fact that one guild did?<br />
Need I remind you that it is Method's fault that the timer was decreased in the first place?<br />
So they used a game mechanic - okay, fine. They admitted to using it- okay, fine.<br />
It doesn't change the fact that fight was impossible without it, and that OTHER GUILDS(yes, Method and Inner Sanctum) will also have their chances once they get the other hard mode keepers down.<br />
<br />
Basicly, the other guilds didn't use it out of integrity/honor, whatever you may call it, but they did have a choice, crying wolf afterwards when a big competitor used it anyway won't help you forward in any way.<br />
<br />
Ensidia did what it had to do to get back in the race with two other guilds, and that's that. Other guilds chose not to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The difference is that they didn't exploit the fights. Ensidia had the same opportunity to do Hodir 25 man hard mode - just as we did - but chose not too. I doubt anyone expected any other guild to do it the first week. I know we didn't!! The Ninja buffing of the hard mode encounters is the heart of the problem here.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lazerbw</div><div class="date">2009-05-03, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So Method and Inner Sanctum don't exist?<br />
<br />
In most cases no :p but its obviously because we aren't as good as ensidia.<br />
<br />
And Method were the only guild with the hodir sigil so they were the only guild ensidia needed to catch up to.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Ninja buffing of the hard mode encounters is the heart of the problem here.<br />
<br />
Hit the nail on the head really as blizzard had more then enough time to see what was possible on the PTR they even spent some days specifically testing hardmodes for bosses like Hodir which from what i could tell actually got changed significantly from the PTR version to the live version with how much damage the various buffs give you and yet they still left the timer at 3minutes which would have been a joke.<br />
<br />
Also limiting the time to 1-2 hours on a boss when your entire raid has 200-300ms and half of them are constantly getting disconnected doesn't help, but seriously if blizzard were to pay me id be happy to test these encounters and get them to the correct difficulty level but currently the PTR doesn't work and buffing bosses after they have been killed has been the worst idea in the history of bad ideas by blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They also gave a very valid reason to why they did it.<br />
<br />
If I were in Ensidias shoes, basicly only playing to get worlds first, haveing to wait for 6 months for new content and then finding out that I don´t have a shot at worlds first because Blizzard screwed me over I´d also considering useing Flower Power.<br />

That is all that needs to be said.<br />
<br />
<br />
How many guilds have done all the other hardmodes?<br />
If you are at 3/4 and stuck on impossible Hodir I´d understand if you are upset but if not.....<br />
And Blizzard are the one to be blamed really, not Ensidia.<br />
<br />
Blizzard should simply deleted the questitems for everyone that did Hodir in 2:30 when they changed the timer and this would never have hapened.<br />
<br />
What´even worse is that Blizzard decided to buff Mimirons hardmode dmg and hp from 25% to 30% with patch 3.1.2. once again f*cking up the race for those guilds who care about it.<br />
Makeing a mistake like that is bad, makeing the same mistake twice is simply terrible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Id just like to point out that the buffs to Mimiron was applied before any kill, so no they didnt re-do their misstake.</div></div><hr />

Thus the &quot;talent&quot; comment. Would you scoff in the face of an olympic gold medalist simply because they spend all of their free time training toward winning the olympics? How is this any different?<br />
<br />
On a side note, it's already been posted in this thread that they don't get payed to play.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, in your opinion. If the Olympic gold medalist injected steroids and won, he still deserves a round of applaus and a medal? :)</div></div><hr />

Iron Council Hard Mode EU First Kill<br />
Silent (EU-Illidan) defeated the Iron Council in hard mode last night, the Hall of Fame has been updated. today?<br />
<br />
i'm confused</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is, killing the middle guy for the quest item first :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
first, hodir (hard) is not impossible just because players are saying so, and i won't believe it unless that information comes from a blue.<br />
it may be impossible right now, but that's because nobody has yet attained the gear to pull this off.<br />
<br />
second, ensidia cheated. that's a fact and cheating is always wrong.<br />
the ones to blame are not blizzard, but ensidia. <br />
blizz changed the timer? so what? that's life. everyone had the same chance of killing him pre-buff and they messed up.<br />
this is in no way a reason to cheat. there are no valid arguments for cheating. never ever! no exceptions!<br />
<br />
finally, there is a boss too tough for ensidia and instead of gearing up and developing a valid strategy they chose to shit all over the other guilds by injecting flower power.<br />
hodir (hard) is the &quot;tour de france&quot; of WoW.<br />
if you can't win, just cheat. those morons will still love you.<br />
<br />
cheaters once, cheaters forever.<br />
for me, ensidia is no longer a top tier raiding guild.<br />
it doesn't matter matter if they admit it, or not.<br />
<br />
&quot;yeah, i killed that guy, but he stood in my way when i had to catch the bus and i didn't want to wait. can i go now?&quot;<br />
<br />
blizzard should reset the algalon chain for ensidia, because THAT would be the one and only right thing to do at the moment.<br />
they don't deserve it.<br />
if you think otherwise then you also think that those cheaters in arena deserve the gladiator title and mount.<br />
there is no difference AT ALL.<br />
<br />
have fun fanboying.</div></div><hr />

Except that with the way his timer is set, it is impossible to beat him in time. Even with full ulduar hard mode gear, dps will not increase enough to facilitate the timer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i run kelthuzad for the head piece for many months till i got it (it only dropped 2 times for our guild in half year), and turning tide only 1 (a mage took it acc. to DKP's) (i am a lock)........ in almost half year of runs ... not to mention wall of terror never dropped... and 1 betrayer .... (we only made it to auriaya in 10 man ulduar , after that 90% of my guildies quited WOW since is anoying prolongation. not fun anymore)</div></div><hr />
