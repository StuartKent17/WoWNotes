New Allied Races Ready to Recruit<br />
Have you unlocked Dark Iron Dwarves (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7383-Dark-Iron-Dwarf-Customization) or Mag'har Orcs (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7432-Battle-for-Azeroth-Allied-Races-Mag-har-Orcs-Preview)?<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; src=&quot;https://secure.polldaddy.com/p/10094006.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://polldaddy.com/poll/10094006/&quot;&gt;Are you working on unlocking the new Allied Races?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;<br />
<br />
With the war between the Horde and the Alliance in full swing, you’ll need every ally you can get to help ensure victory for your faction. The journey to bring two new Allied Races—Mag’har orcs (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21701413) and Dark Iron dwarves (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21701413)—into the fold has begun in Kul Tiras and Zandalar.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
You can earn the loyalty of these two Allied Races and add their might to your faction by meeting the following requirements:<br />
<br />
<br />
Reach level 120<br />
Become Exalted with the key subfaction from your side’s War Campaign:<br />
<br />
Alliance: 7th Legion<br />
Horde: The Honorbound<br />
<br />
<br />
Complete the War Campaign in Kul Tiras and Zandalar and earn the Achievement Ready for War (earnable on both Horde and Alliance).<br />
<br />
<br />
Two paths lay before you. Which will you take?<br />

Expulsom Sources<br />
I am trying to level jewelcrafting but it requires 2 expulsom to craft a single gem. It is a long way to 150 when expulsum is, seemingly, so rare. How do you guys manage to gather larger amounts of this stuff? I've scrapped a ton of gear with only a few expulsom as a result.<br />
Personally I've managed to obtain, most of the Expulsom from scrapping gear, especially trinkets, that I would not use or were a downgrade for my character. If you see a world quest that offers a trinket, go for it, as it may offer you an Expulsom material - that excludes crafted trinkets. You can also manufacture it if you have the Alchemy profession. So maybe level that profession up, along with your Jewelcrafting?

2 weeks is considered Slow? Considering how many people are exalted now, this was way quicker than void elf rep.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its 2 weeks if you didnt miss any WQ since launch, yes. I just hit revered with casual play, but I also dont care about the allied races. Too bad that a major selling point of an expansion is tied to heavy rep grinds, especially older expansion reps.</div></div><hr />

I missed the first day of rep plus the bonus 1500 rep from the island expeditions quest before the first day reset and I hit exalted 2 days ago as a night elf. It's not a huge grind and people pretending it is clearly haven't done any real grinds before.</div></div><hr />

As far as i know that is his real voice, that is why he gets a lot of work doing the voice overs, his claim to fame so to speak is when he does the movie honest trailers.. They don't call him the epic voice guy for nothing.. :)</div></div><hr />

Already at Revered just from &quot;casual play&quot; and calls it a heavy rep grind. You must be new to the game if you consider that a heavy grind.</div></div><hr />

Yeah... I'm doing the WQ circuit because I see little else to do as far as BFA is concerned. I could care less about the 'rewards'. The gear is trash, I don't care about crafting, and the mounts are a consolation prize at best. Once I'm done with it (in about a week), outside of raid nights I don't know why I'll even bother to login. They couldn't even bother to finish class design, add a new battleground, or make leveling alts a more engaging experience this time around. If 8.1 isn't 'game changing' I think I'm tapping out for good this time.</div></div><hr />

Just posting this again for emphasis. Reputation gains are really well tuned I think, especially with the huge boosts you can get from the mission table. I just finished a mission that gave me (human) about 900 reputation with the Champions of Azeroth. If we're talking about a real grind I'd say that right now only the Azerite system qualifies for it, and even that only if you try to get ahead of the curve.</div></div><hr />

Did not use contracts because I save my gold for the Brontosaur mount and other things I want to buy. I guess, I will unlock Mag'har Orcs somewhere next week, that's quite OK for me. Rep grind is not as bad as with some reputations I did (91 exalted on my main), the only annoying thing is that you need reputation and occasional missions to progress with the War Campaign. I thought they would not repeat the Legion ordeal (Suramar, Argus) once again.<br />
<br />
Will definitively play Alliance and unlock Dark Iron Dwarves, but sometimes later in the expansion, when I am done with my Horde alts. Have 25 alts there on 110 and also a HMT in the range of 40. :D<br />
<br />
But I am more excited to get a Zandalari Troll. Will make a loa priestess, and if we somehow would get paladins (if the story moves forward and will return the class to the Zandalari), then of course also one of these.</div></div><hr />

This shit again. Just leave and stop wasting other people's reading time. BfA is the fastest selling expansion because the overwhelming majority of players thinks that they have, once again, done a really great job. They just don't bother posting replies to this nonsense because they are too busy enjoying the game.</div></div><hr />

The gear is trash, I don't care about crafting, and the mounts are a consolation prize at best. Once I'm done with it (in about a week), outside of raid nights I don't know why I'll even bother to login. They couldn't even bother to finish class design, add a new battleground, or make leveling alts a more engaging experience this time around. If 8.1 isn't 'game changing' I think I'm tapping out for good this time.<br />
<br />
A lot more is being added to the game next week.<br />
<br />
1st Raid, Warfronts, Mythic +, Arenas, World bosses etc.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should read and get some context before replying. Btw, are you really implying that its ok for new people to come back for BfA just to realise that you've to undergo a several weeks long rep grind in order to play a new race, a major selling point of the expansion? Especially if they want to play the races tied to Legion rep.</div></div><hr />

So you wanted to play corrupted uncorrupted orcs? Orc warlocks are the reason the race has green skin.</div></div><hr />

Aren't these Mag'har the pure ones before corruption?<br />
<br />
Would make sense if that is the case. If they are post corruption then I get your point.<br />

An orc literally can't be a warlock without their skin turning green. The whole point of Mag'har is that they are uncorrupted by fel magic. That's what &quot;Mag'har&quot; means.<br />
<br />
Shadow Priests show no outward signs of corruption, it's an internal psychological struggle against the whispers. They can turn off Shadow Form.</div></div><hr />

So if I get some green paint and paint my Mag'hars skin green I can be a Warlock? :D</div></div><hr />

Amen brother. Sadly, a good WoW is not forthcoming. The only thing that will convince the moneymen at Blizz is when Classic outperforms BfA. Someone will FINALLY put two and two together and see that the current dev team has &quot;innovated&quot; this game so far away from it's amazing design that they fire the leadership and bring back some folks that are truly WoW passionate developers. Not those mathhead tryhards from Elitist Jerks.</div></div><hr />

1. Buy Battle For Azeroth!<br />
2. Grind for what feels like 5000 years, because 14 years in we still couldn't come up with something else then grinding fart-amounts of reputation spread over thousands and thousands of repetitive content! ... ... ... ...<br />
3. Finish the questline<br />
THATS IT! :D<br />
<br />
I like this expansion but... just stick reputation grinds where the sun doesnt shine.</div></div><hr />
