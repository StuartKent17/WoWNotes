LOS ANGELES, Calif. – July 22, 2009 -- Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and Legendary Pictures announced today that Sam Raimi has signed on to direct the eagerly-anticipated major motion picture based on Blizzard Entertainment®’s award-winning Warcraft® universe. Raimi has, in the course of his career, clearly demonstrated a genius for developing and adapting existing fictional universes for mainstream audiences while staying true to the spirit of the original content.<br />
<br />
Raimi directed the Spider-Man trilogy, which has broken box-office records around the world and garnered five Academy Award® nominations. Known for his imaginative filmmaking style, richly drawn characters and offbeat humor, Raimi wrote and directed the cult classic, The Evil Dead and produced 30 Days Of Night. He most recently wrote and directed the supernatural thriller, Drag Me To Hell.<br />
<br />
&quot;At its core, Warcraft is a fantastic, action-packed story,&quot; said Raimi. &quot;I am thrilled to work with such a dynamite production team to bring this project to the big screen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles Roven’s producing talents were recently seen with last summer’s blockbuster The Dark Knight, which grossed in excess of $1 billion, was nominated for eight Academy Awards® and won two. His body of work also includes the widely acclaimed Batman Begins and the sci-fi classic 12 Monkeys. Roven, with Atlas producing partner Alex Gartner, will be producing with Legendary Pictures CEO Thomas Tull, Legendary’s Chief Creative Officer Jon Jashni, Raimi and Raimi’s producing partner Joshua Donen. Raimi’s partner, Robert Tapert, will be an Executive Producer and Blizzard Entertainment’s Senior Vice President of Creative Development, Chris Metzen, a Co-Producer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Partnering with Sam Raimi exemplifies Legendary's mandate of marrying the highest quality intellectual property to world-class filmmakers&quot; said Legendary’s Tull. &quot;Sam's passion for 'Warcraft' is undeniable and we know that he will create an incredible film worthy of Blizzard's phenomenal franchise. We look forward to collaborating with our partners at Warner Bros. and continuing our successful relationship with Chuck in bringing this rich new world to the screen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Blizzard Entertainment and Legendary Pictures have a shared vision for this film and we searched at length to find the very best director to bring that vision to life,&quot; said Paul Sams, chief operating officer of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;From our first conversation with Sam, we could tell he was the perfect choice. Sam knows how to simultaneously satisfy the enthusiasts and the mainstream audience that might be experiencing that content for the first time. We're looking forward to working with him to achieve that here.&quot;<br />
<br />
Class Q&amp;A Series: Warrior (Part 2)<br />
Aside from some of the other questions that we have been able to answer throughout this thread, we have also gotten additional feedback on what we have observed as being very pressing issues to the Warrior community. Those questions and their answers can be found below.<br />
<br />
Follow up Question:<br />
<br />
Community Team: Some players feel that, while tanking, having to continually hit Heroic Strike to match your weapon’s swing can become somewhat tedious.<br />
<br />
Q: Do we currently have any plans to change Heroic Strike to make it no longer necessary to hit that button on every weapon swing?<br />
<br />
A: Yes, we really don’t like way Heroic Strike works. On-next-swing attacks just don’t feel right and for tanks especially you can convert every white attack into a Heroic Strike. Unfortunately, they do the job, which is why we haven’t changed it yet. It’s job is to let warriors bleed off excess rage by converting it to damage and / or threat. It’s possible to fix this in other ways, such as perhaps the hit consuming more rage the more you have Execute-style.<br />
<br />
Community Team: It appears that many players who enjoy the Warrior class for its damage aspects continue to feel that, without best in-slot items, their class’s performance is very truncated.<br />
<br />
Q: Is this an issue that we have seen in the Warrior class? If so, do we have any plans to accommodate those players who do not have best in-slot items, while still keeping those with the very best equipment from being too powerful?<br />
<br />
A: This really just gets back to the way rage works, which is that damage leads to rage so you have to pick a point at which you balance warriors. High damage and high rage? Low damage and low rage? The way to fix it is to normalize rage even more so that you always get X rage per second regardless of gear. But once you always get X rage per second you essentially just have rogue energy. So, as with the previous question, we don’t like the way it is working and want to change it but we don’t have a perfect substitute in the can just yet.</div></div><hr />

Even though i didn't like spiderman 1+2 (well, not as much as i'd wanted to like it), Sam Raimi is still a helluva director</div></div><hr />

Quentin Taratino would be full of fails, seriously the most overrated director in HISTORY, my friends begged me to watch Pulp Fiction and half way through the movie I still didnt know what the fuck it was about.<br />

But thats an opinion and we all have those :o</div></div><hr />

<br />
Legendary Studios is nothing short of amazing.<br />
<br />
Sam Raimi is an accomplished, and extremely capable director. <br />
<br />
This decision was long in the making, and well done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a huge timeline out there, which will they choose?<br />
<br />
As long as the main characters are people like Thrall/Jaina in the classic lore stories, and not &quot;Serennia&quot;s grinding their 50 arena games a week, it should be good.</div></div><hr />

Spiderman 1 and 2 though? Great action movies, and anyone that says otherwise is nuts.<br />

Really, anyone that has watched Evil Dead or Army of Darkness will know why this is awesome, WarCraft is all about the mix of an epic backdrop, mixed with lots of action and tongue-in-cheek humor, and Sam is a master of putting those elements together. Add in a big budget and I sense something that will be epic.</div></div><hr />

I get mixed emotions here. Blizzard is gonna throw a shit ton of money at this project. If they get a good script and story, this could be an epic film. However, if they try too control too much of the film it could ruin in, as you said with spidey3. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valtiel</div><div class="date">2009-07-22, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder how they will approach the storyline.<br />
<br />
The background of Warcraft is somewhat rich - there's a lot of info on locations, races and historical events. They have a lot of material to build the BACKDROP of the story.<br />
<br />
However, the actual STORY of Warcraft is extremely shallow.<br />
The original plot about the Dark Portal can be used as a skeleton, but it's a colossal &quot;been there, done that&quot; fantasy trope without real dept or interesting events.<br />
<br />
Arthas's story is a blatant ripoff of Star Wars - it works in the game, but it would be redicolous on the big screen; people would tear the movie apart, expecially consider how close in time is the &quot;Darth Vader Origins&quot; episode of SW.<br />
<br />
It's the greatest challenge right now. The World of Warcraft is a very decent fantasy backdrop. The Story of Warcraft fluctuates from clichèd to downright terrible, so they're sort of in a fix because either they make up something completely new (and they need to integrate it into the current lore, because making a WoW movie and not having Thrall in it would be suicide), or they make an extremely predictable action flick about Darth Arthas that certainly won't reach the levels of the LotR trilogy.<br />
<br />
Lord of the Rings worked because it had a fantastic world, epic battles but most importantly good characters and a classic story. The WoW movie can easily have the first two, but for the rest...</div></div><hr />

Not funny? I suppose it's a type of humor not everyone shares. Oh and btw best pulp fiction inspired guild name.<br />

The movie wasn't so much a complex story to understand as it was a wonderfully fractured timeline of events interweaving a few overlapping storylines. The joy in the movie is the unconventional manner in which the whole story is presented. The lack of A to B typical plot development provided a fresh storytelling environment which I enjoyed because it takes away jaded preconceptions about formulaic storytelling. As you say there really wasn't a lot of story, but there was a number of stories and their development and interplay was interesting to me. Also Samuel L. Jackson as a bad ass, bible quoting, wander the earth like Caine revelation having hit man has it's appeal. Oh and there is lots of drugs, violence, brutally creative colorful language and other ridiculousness that upon reflection makes me want to revisit the movie sometime soon. Not everyone's cup of tea, so for comparison I ask, what is a movie you do really enjoy?<br />
<br />
If you have not watched something called pulp muppets (and actually know the original muppets show) google it.<br />

As for Raimi. I like it, my pleasure with the spiderman series went progressively down, but with metzen as a producer I am pretty sure it will come out authentic. Raimi's previous work certainly is entertaining and I am very excited to see how it plays out</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guillermo Del Toro or Peter Jackson would be better choices imo.<br />
<br />
I didn't really like the Spiderman movies as well, but that's because of the Spiderman story, not because of Raimi. <br />
Guillermo Del Toro movies, like Pan's Labyrinth and Hellboy 2 (where he was visual director), are too weird, too far-fetched for lots of people, so that would make the movie not as mainstream as they probably want it. As said in the original post, they want this to be a movie for enthousiasts and people who don't Warcraft yet alike.<br />
<br />
Peter Jackson sounds cool, but I'm afraid his elves and orcs would just be way too much like Lord of the Rings, and I wouldn't want to compare one Warcraft movie with LotR, since then it'll suck anyway. <br />
<br />
Raimi did a brilliant job on Drag me to Hell, which was very unlike most of the recent horror movies, and I think this movie might be good. As someone else wrote, there is no middle way: it'll be epic or epic fail. I just hope they won't pick too many famous actors for it, so no Brad Pitt as Bolvar Fordragon or such.</div></div><hr />

Warcraft doesn't have a real story - several plots, mostly ripped off from other fiction (to the point of mocking the names, like Yogg Saron etc), but no real story.<br />

You know that the Warcraft franchise extends far beyond World of Warcraft, right?<br />
<br />
What do we know about the movie? They're planning on setting it about a year before WoW, it'll have an Alliance PoV but show major figures on both sides, and they want it to be a war epic, not a fantasy adventure.<br />
<br />
Raimi and Legendary pictures are more than capable of making any movie they're given, all they need is a good story and good actors, as far as I'm concerned. The quality of the movie relies pretty much soley on the screenplay and casting.<br />
<br />
Granted, the Warcraft series doesn't always have the best writing, but it shouldn't be too big of a task to come up with a two hour movie script.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I'd hardly say Warcraft is &quot;mocking&quot; the Cthulhu mythos with the Old Gods. There's a big difference between &quot;mocking&quot; and &quot;paying tribute to&quot;.</div></div><hr />

One thing you need to understand is that Samuel L. Jackson wasn't SAMUEL L. JACKSON until he made Pulp Fiction. I could see someone from today, after Jackson has become overexposed and maybe a bit cliched, watching Pulp Fiction and glossing over his performance. <br />
<br />
Also, prior to Pulp Fiction, John Travolta was typecast into making crappy family films. He was perceived a lot like Eddie Murphy is now. So to see him assume a grubby demeanor, cursing, and killing people was extremely shocking and showed he had more range than people thought. Pulp Fiction transformed Travolta into an action star. <br />
<br />
It would be like Eddie Murphy putting on a little weight, growing his hair out, developing a mean streak and playing Travolta's role, and then pulling it off with flying colors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Far beyond... till the Warcraft games. Which is what I'm speaking of. I wouldn't even waste time speaking of the WoW &quot;story&quot; or the awful books.<br />
<br />
If we want to resume:<br />
<br />
- world of warcraft has NO story<br />
- warcraft has poor, ripped off stories<br />
- both have a pretty impressive background<br />
<br />
Besides, whether it is mocking or paying tribute, WoW basically doesn't do anything else: every plot, location, name, character is blatantly &quot;inspired&quot; to some fictional source they are &quot;paying omage&quot; to.<br />
Which is fine, it works in a game, but you can't bring Haris Pilton or Darth Arthas to the big screen.<br />
<br />
The problem is that there's no actual meat to the Warcraft lore. It's a chain of ripoffs from Warhammer to Lord of the Rings to Starwars to Lovecraft and while those cameos are lovely in a game that nobody really takes seriously, it also means that the director will have nothing (except potentially the Illidan storyline) that is WARCRAFT and only WARCRAFT to work on.<br />
<br />
Which gets us to what I said above: sure, they can write a plot better than what WoW ever had (hardly a challenge), but they will infuriate fans who will cry about how there's no Arthas or Thrall is doing stuff that didn't happen in the games. This is the core problem - to achieve quality, they will need to disregard the source, and this will enrage the nerds.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S.: to Necrotan: yes, I read the books, and I found them beyond horrible. I really hope they don't touch that unimaginative dribble and go for something original (and also more easily resumable in 2 hours). However, I would prefer a War of the Ancients movie than an Arthas Star Wars Ripoff.</div></div><hr />

LOS ANGELES, Calif. – July 22, 2009 -- Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. and Legendary Pictures announced today that Sam Raimi has signed on to direct the eagerly-anticipated major motion picture based on Blizzard Entertainment®’s award-winning Warcraft® universe. Raimi has, in the course of his career, clearly demonstrated a genius for developing and adapting existing fictional universes for mainstream audiences while staying true to the spirit of the original content.<br />
<br />
Raimi directed the Spider-Man trilogy, which has broken box-office records around the world and garnered five Academy Award® nominations. Known for his imaginative filmmaking style, richly drawn characters and offbeat humor, Raimi wrote and directed the cult classic, The Evil Dead and produced 30 Days Of Night. He most recently wrote and directed the supernatural thriller, Drag Me To Hell.<br />
<br />
&quot;At its core, Warcraft is a fantastic, action-packed story,&quot; said Raimi. &quot;I am thrilled to work with such a dynamite production team to bring this project to the big screen.&quot;<br />
<br />
Charles Roven’s producing talents were recently seen with last summer’s blockbuster The Dark Knight, which grossed in excess of $1 billion, was nominated for eight Academy Awards® and won two. His body of work also includes the widely acclaimed Batman Begins and the sci-fi classic 12 Monkeys. Roven, with Atlas producing partner Alex Gartner, will be producing with Legendary Pictures CEO Thomas Tull, Legendary’s Chief Creative Officer Jon Jashni, Raimi and Raimi’s producing partner Joshua Donen. Raimi’s partner, Robert Tapert, will be an Executive Producer and Blizzard Entertainment’s Senior Vice President of Creative Development, Chris Metzen, a Co-Producer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Partnering with Sam Raimi exemplifies Legendary's mandate of marrying the highest quality intellectual property to world-class filmmakers&quot; said Legendary’s Tull. &quot;Sam's passion for 'Warcraft' is undeniable and we know that he will create an incredible film worthy of Blizzard's phenomenal franchise. We look forward to collaborating with our partners at Warner Bros. and continuing our successful relationship with Chuck in bringing this rich new world to the screen.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Blizzard Entertainment and Legendary Pictures have a shared vision for this film and we searched at length to find the very best director to bring that vision to life,&quot; said Paul Sams, chief operating officer of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;From our first conversation with Sam, we could tell he was the perfect choice. Sam knows how to simultaneously satisfy the enthusiasts and the mainstream audience that might be experiencing that content for the first time. We're looking forward to working with him to achieve that here.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
So..... is there anything good that he's actually directed.....<br />
I don't know who I'd prefer to direct this, but none of those movies are any good, lets face it!</div></div><hr />

The movie isn't one big story, it's several stories. And you aren't supposed to understand the big picture, it's just tales from &quot;around the campfire&quot; in the US gangster w/e.

IMO, if there was any specific piece of WoW history which is fitting for a film adaptation, which hasn't been fleshed out yet, and isn't Darth Vader with hair, then I think that the story line of 'Of Blood and Honour' by Chris Metzen would be brilliant! For those who don't read WoW novels or are not Lore-savy, it's the story of how Tirion Fordring became who he is today, from a well respected paladin of his town with a family, son, and everything going his way, to how we very first meet him in EPL back in Vanilla and BC; Dirty, moneyless, living in a hut with nothing for company but his horse. This story would be a fantastic way to represent the Alliance in an unbiased light, as well as the Horde, because the whole story revolves around the relationship between Tirion and Eirtigg the Elder (yes, the unassuming Orc advisor in Thrall's chamber who to most people seemed like a nobody). I think this idea has LOTS of potential. What do you guys think?<br />

<br />
There's a huge timeline out there, which will they choose?<br />
<br />
As long as the main characters are people like Thrall/Jaina in the classic lore stories, and not &quot;Serennia&quot;s grinding their 50 arena games a week, it should be good.<br />
<br />
<br />
I see some people are claming metzen has said none of the familiar characters will be in the movie... I sure as hell hope that is not true.</div></div><hr />

Is it going to be a single film or multiple films?<br />
What actors?<br />
Is this the right director for the project?<br />

Time will tell.<br />
As many has said this can go either way, good or bad. it will not be in the middle. you either have to get it right or it will go wrong.<br />
<br />
They definately got tones of lore, backing, ideas.. but I among others have loads of ifs and buts.<br />

*Ahem* But seriously. Of Blood and Honour. WoW Film. My post on previous page. Opinions? Also if you think it's a terrible idea or has some holes in it please do point it out. I have a feeling in my mind that it may well be what they base the film on though, considering it is based roughly 1 year before WoW is set, if my calculation of the WoW timeline is correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They know a few things about success. First of all, a CGI movie would have failed massively. It doesn't attract non-wow players and nobody would take it seriously, so it has to be live action. Second, they've hired an accomplished producer and director, yes, half of his movies suck, but YOU CAN SAY THAT ABOUT ANY DIRECTOR. <br />
<br />
The movie will be an epic box office smash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously though.. <br />
I'm really excited about a Warcraft movie. Metzen said that it will NOT be based on any story of Warcraft or WoW but will be a story inside the universe, wich is in my opinion the best way to make a movie about a game. He also said that it will be from an Alliance p.o.v. wich justifies the use of real actors. And to those that fear that it wont be realistic... Have you seen what todays CGI can do??? Pirates of the Caribbean, the crew of Davy Jones? (squidface (not a Draenei)) All those characters where CGI. And that's even an old movie!<br />
Ted Raimi is a great director. And Spiderman proves that. They are great movies and specially the second one reflects the comic book at its best.<br />
I have full confidence that Sam wel make a great movie. It cant fail, not with Blizzards &quot;its done when its done&quot; mentallity.<br />
<br />
PS. If you cant see the refference of Joxer and all this you are either too young or too old!</div></div><hr />

OR Blizzard simply didn't want the Warcraft Movie to be associated with the LotR one, even dubbed a ripoff. <br />

Blizzard is gonna throw a shit ton of money at this project. If they get a good script and story, this could be an epic film. However, if they try too control too much of the film it could ruin in, as you said with spidey3. <br />
<br />
I really don't think this film has a middle ground. It'll either be epic, or epic failure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly what I was thinking while reading few of the posts. I personally have no vendetta against Sam Raimi or his movies and I'm thrilled to actually see some big names here (Sam Raimi, Legendary Pictures etc.). However as the person I quoted said it'll either be a complete fiasco or a huge phenomenon...</div></div><hr />

Or they can use the rich background to write a completely new story? It should be a scriptwriters dream to get all this<br />
amazing lore and backgrounds and a white paper to write a new story on. It's all there. The hard work is done. They don't<br />
HAVE to make a movie based on an existing story...<br />

And Blizzard can use it themselves to design new content.</div></div><hr />

a) a huge part of the LotR movie's success was the hype around it, and the pink-glassedness of fans<br />
b) Everyone knows that you just have to put a team that created a huge commercial success on a similar project to make it just as big without any effort ::)<br />

<br />
Cant wait for this to be released, i will drag all my friends and family to see this even if there not a fan of WoW lol and i hope to god they based to movie at the start of the whole WoW lore and do some explanation rather then jumping right into it, which will probabaly confuse me because i dont know the whole lore.<br />
<br />
This movie will be one you will want to see at the cinema and would like to think true WoW fans wont ruin it and download the movie or w/e<br />
<br />
And one more thing can ppl not post negative comments like this movie will fail etc thats just a ridiculous thing to say when they have only just found the directors and im sure with the amount of budget that will be for this film, fail is the last thing it will be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They know a few things about success. First of all, a CGI movie would have failed massively. It doesn't attract non-wow players and nobody would take it seriously, so it has to be live action. Second, they've hired an accomplished producer and director, yes, half of his movies suck, but YOU CAN SAY THAT ABOUT ANY DIRECTOR. <br />
<br />
The movie will be an epic box office smash. <br />
<br />
<br />
It's too bad this movie isn't being made by Blizzard. It's being made by Legendary Pictures. Blizz is simply licensing the story to them.<br />
<br />
Prepare for a terrible movie that will make a ton of money because we will all go see it anyway because we play wow.</div></div><hr />

As many has said this can go either way, good or bad. it will not be in the middle. you either have to get it right or it will go wrong.<br />

They definately got tones of lore, backing, ideas.. but I among others have loads of ifs and buts.<br />
I hold my expectations high with the reminder this isn't gonna be everyone's idea of what the film will be like(on release).<br />

-----<br />
<br />
<br />
To answer few of your questions: <br />
<br />
<br />
What story they gonna &quot;fit in&quot;?<br />
<br />
The main character is set to be a new hero described as a &quot;kick-ass Human&quot;. Chris Metzen has stated that the new &quot;kick-ass Human&quot; character in the movie is not same one as in the comic (now known to be Varian Wrynn).WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Warcraft_movie)<br />
<br />
What time?<br />
<br />
The movie is set one year before World of Warcraft.WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Warcraft_movie)<br />
<br />
What battles? <br />
<br />
Obviously nothing we have seen before in World of Warcraft, but most likely some tensity between Horde &amp; Alliance, and possibly Scourge?<br />
<br />
Is it going to be a single film or multiple films?<br />
<br />
The film is described as the &quot;first film&quot;, raising obvious possibilities as to future installments. Nothing is for certain though...WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Warcraft_movie)<br />
<br />
What actors?<br />
<br />
No actors have been confirmed yet...<br />
<br />
Is this the right director for the project?<br />
<br />
Now that's a thing we can only argue about...<br />
<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Warcraft&quot; itself has been developed for few years by Legendary Pictures and the publisher of the video game version Blizzard Entertainment. Producer Thomas Tull previously has mentioned that the studio aims a PG-13 rating for this movie.IMDb (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0803096/)<br />
<br />
<br />
Now the good new is that it has already been developed for few years as the quote above states, but it'll still take time finish so it won't be out before 2011.</div></div><hr />

Here's your answer for that:<br />

<br />
The movie will be two to two and a half hours long, and both Legendary and Blizzard want it to have an epic action kind of feel.Blizzcon 2007 (http://pc.ign.com/articles/810/810700p1.html)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a huge timeline out there, which will they choose?<br />
<br />
As long as the main characters are people like Thrall/Jaina in the classic lore stories, and not &quot;Serennia&quot;s grinding their 50 arena games a week, it should be good.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's a few quotes from press releases:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It will focus more on growing tensions between the races of the World of Warcraft universe and eventually culminate with some kind of battle. Characters likely to make an appearance include Bolvar Fordragon, Thrall, and Cairne Bloodhoof.Blizzcon 2007 (http://pc.ign.com/articles/810/810700p1.html)<br />
<br />
<br />
The movie is set one year before World of Warcraft and will primarily told from the Alliance's POV, though Metzen says his heart lies with the Horde. Characters such as Cairne Bloodhoof, Thrall, Sylvanas Windrunner and Bolvar Fordragon are likely to make appearances.WoWWiki (http://www.wowwiki.com/Warcraft_movie)<br />
<br />
<br />

Hes been doing the best art for Blizzards games since the early 90's. <br />
<br />
Also, people seem to forget that Blizzard is a company... They won't care much if the movie becomes an epic fail, people will still pay to see this movie and that's what media entertainment is all about... Making money. <br />
And Raimi is a great director! Every director has made a bad movie, or two... Perhapps 3 or 4... But the point is that Blizzard Entertainment AND Legendary Pictures are working TOGETHER to make this an epic movie! Besides, Blizz got a hell of a lot money to waste on this project.<br />

<br />
I'll be happy if they can make something worth 3.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, the best thing they could do is a saturday morning cartoon. Something like Clone Wars - something that appeals to the kids (let's face it, there's no dept to the Warcraft world), but adults can still watch to feed their inner child.<br />
<br />
A saturday morning cartoon would have the breath to go through the real Warcraft story, and give the people who know it exactly what they want and the people who don't know it a taste of the cartoonish World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
As I said above, if they actually manage to put together a 2 hours movie about Warcraft, and actually a good one... it won't be much about Warcraft. It will be a movie with Orcs and Taurens set in a world described in 3 lines of introduction - if that's enough to make it &quot;Warcraft&quot;, it's up to you to decide.</div></div><hr />

I guess we will just have to wait and see whatever they can wring out of the wow lore.. One thing is for sure, they will most likely mess up alot of lore.. sam raimi's portfolio screams of messing with already known lore and storylines.<br />
<br />
What i dont want to see:<br />
- Street fighter'ish conversion (that movie killed a small part of me)<br />
- kungfu/karate/whatever scenes.. <br />
- morronic american one-liners (you can always dream)<br />
- transformer'ish editing.. seriously you cant even tell whats what in that jumble.<br />
- NO effing &quot;funny sidekick&quot;.. <br />
<br />
What i want to see:<br />
- large scale battles, lotr type - but maybe with more braveheart'ish focus on the key characters.<br />
- tonnes and tonnes of cgi<br />
- huge swarms of undead psychos.. and hopefully made so they look &quot;fucking seriuz bsness&quot;.. instead of disney'ish mickey mouse enemies. (peter jackson would have rocked here tho - he has a long history of monster movies)<br />
- blizzard humour all the way</div></div><hr />

The novels are terrible. They're the kind of shovelware you get from &quot;X-men the movie: the book&quot; novels, with the added irony of being essentially an excuse to retcon Warcraft lore for WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really they're not all that different from the dozens and dozens of Star Wars &quot;Lore&quot; books out there that Lucas Arts contracted out to write.<br />
<br />
They're awful as &quot;literature&quot; and aren't deep in any literary sense of the word. <br />
<br />
But on the other hand, the reason books are typically very difficult to make into movies is because they're too deep. What a good writer can detail in 10 pages of prose a director has to try to envision and fit into thirty seconds or a minute's worth of dialogue and everything else is what's appearing in the background. <br />
<br />
Part of the reason the LoTR movies were such a huge success is their amazing ability to depict the &quot;vision&quot; of middle earth that is described in Tolkien's books.'<br />
<br />
On the other hand, in &quot;video game&quot; movies (and comic movies) are the oppisite. You have an already created vision of what the universe ought to look like, but you have a relatively skeletal story line in which to create it. Look at spiderman. The plot line of any given individual comic was pretty thin. &quot;A gets in trouble, Spiderman Saves him&quot; or &quot;B villain appears, Spiderman deals with him.&quot; everything else was developed over multiple comics or was outside &quot;Lore.&quot;<br />
<br />
The challenge of creating the movie is writing dialogue and scripting scenes that fit that &quot;vision&quot; but also present the skeletal storyline in a compelling way.</div></div><hr />

Raimi could make a daring choice and tell the tale of how the orcs escaped the extermination camps set up by the alliance after the II war; he could try to depict a side of the WoW lore that is a reflection (and hopefully not just a mock-up) of real history. He could write a tale about man and orc eventually seeing eye to eye; or a tale about the Scourge's desperate battle.<br />
<br />
However, he would probably meet &quot;WUT WHY IS THE ALLIANCE THE BADS GUYZ&quot; reaction, if not worse. He could try to dig in the deepest corners of the wow lore, but what I'm confident we will see in the end is Prettyboy and Prettygirl save the world from the bad monsters.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure there will be some famous heroes and what not but im kinda excited to see what its going to be about blizzcon is going to be amazing this year...wow movie, new expac, diab 3, SC2 and perhaps a new hint of what the new mmo is gonna be. cant wait!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Another challenge would be that of having the story being told from the perspective of the Alliance.<br />

<br />
its not his choice what the story will be. Chris Metzen and the other writers are the ones that are hammering out the story/script. Also the story of a man and orc seeing eye to eye has been done :P Tirion Fodring and Etrigg go read &quot;Of Blood and Honor&quot; i believe it is.<br />
<br />
Also being that Sam is from Michigan, I really hope he uses some of the places here for the movie, especially w/ the amount of money he could save. could pretty much shoot here for half the price. There is a lot of places he could use for the movie that are reminiscent of Eastern Kingdoms.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valtiel</div><div class="date">2009-07-22, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really they're not all that different from the dozens and dozens of Star Wars &quot;Lore&quot; books out there that Lucas Arts contracted out to write.<br />
<br />
They're awful as &quot;literature&quot; and aren't deep in any literary sense of the word. <br />
<br />
But on the other hand, the reason books are typically very difficult to make into movies is because they're too deep. What a good writer can detail in 10 pages of prose a director has to try to envision and fit into thirty seconds or a minute's worth of dialogue and everything else is what's appearing in the background. <br />
<br />
Part of the reason the LoTR movies were such a huge success is their amazing ability to depict the &quot;vision&quot; of middle earth that is described in Tolkien's books.'<br />
<br />
On the other hand, in &quot;video game&quot; movies (and comic movies) are the oppisite. You have an already created vision of what the universe ought to look like, but you have a relatively skeletal story line in which to create it. Look at spiderman. The plot line of any given individual comic was pretty thin. &quot;A gets in trouble, Spiderman Saves him&quot; or &quot;B villain appears, Spiderman deals with him.&quot; everything else was developed over multiple comics or was outside &quot;Lore.&quot;<br />
<br />
The challenge of creating the movie is writing dialogue and scripting scenes that fit that &quot;vision&quot; but also present the skeletal storyline in a compelling way. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Very correct analysis.<br />
<br />
But it also helps us making a further step: take the Star Wars saga. One of the biggest successes in the history of entertainment. It spawned books, games, videogames, an empire.<br />
<br />
But what is at the roots? SW is very simple. Its success is simple. There's the special effects, the novelty, the solid script - but what made it a legend is a few iconic elements (Jedi, the Force, etc) and a very simple, yet incredibly powerful plot twist (I am your *biiiip*).<br />
<br />
That's how you explain SW. It has some very simple elements, put together without overexposition, and they worked into the movie format. People dreamed about those movies - they came out wanting more, and that spawned the empire.<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW has to go through the opposite process. It needs to find those core elements that make it &quot;popular&quot; and translated them on the screen.<br />
And this is the biggest challenge: WoW doesn't have distinctive marks. It's popular because it's both Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings, it's Warhammer and Dungeons and Dragons, it's Monthy Python and Dracula, it's Frankenstein and Dark Vader, it's Harry Potter and King Arthur.<br />
<br />
WoW built itself over cameos and tributes. Its world, expecially in the MMO incarnation, is literally a translation of our world, our myths, our fictions in fantasy terms. Every trope, every fad, every story that is popular in the real world you can find in WoW. <br />
But now WoW needs to stand on its own legs, and tell a tale that is about WoW. It needs to invent and not copy. And in all honesty, I wouldn't know where to start. There is nothing to WoW that the world haven't seen before, probably in bigger dept. I can imagine a movie about Warhammer, because that's an unique world with a strong identity. I can't really see the identity of WoW, because what makes WoW great is Darth Arthas, it's the copied Warhammer Orcs, it's the copied Lovecraft myth - what makes WoW great is how familiar it feels at all times.<br />
<br />
If the movie is made about what is unique about WoW, we risk getting a lame story about Rhonin, Krasus or Illidan, and that means more or less the same lameness of the D&amp;D movie.<br />
It's really NOT easy to make a WoW movie.</div></div><hr />

You want to know the difference between Warcraft and Warhammer? The letters after the word &quot;War&quot; in their names. If you think the world Warhammer is any more unique than Warcraft, you're simply fooling yourself. The funny thing is, every other &quot;iconic&quot; and &quot;unique&quot; piece of fantasy or sci-fi (from Star Wars to LotR) borrows from earlier works of literature. This has been going on since cavemen were scrawling the glories of the hunt on their walls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Star Wars is considered way more than just a plot twist. What drew people in was the world itself. When Star Wars was released, this whole space thing and people with laser swords and weird creatures was all new. In the generation we live in it's all been done. It's not all that easy to make something that is completely original and never heard of before.<br />
<br />
I highly doubt Chris Metzen would allow the movie to be turned into some lame story. In fact, they're not making it out to be an adventure movie as they have already said in the Bizzcon 07 panel. It will be a war movie. I do expect a lot of action from it and a lot of drama/conflict as well. <br />
<br />
Regardless of what you may think of the novels, I enjoy them (May I add I also like the Star Wars novels everyone looks down on). They are short novels that narrate parts of the lore. It's not meant to be this intricate universe full of plot twists and cliches. Granted, I do find a lot of characters from the Warcraft universe to be interesting and in a way I see them as criticism on mankind's values and morals (Take Admiral Blackmoore and the orc slaves) but that would be to overanalyze what could something as simple as &quot;Maybe the ugly guys are not all that bad&quot;.<br />
<br />
I've yet to see some other story that doesn't portray orcs, trolls and minotaurs as the bad guys. But rather as intelligent beings with their own purpose in life other than just destroy everything in their path.<br />
<br />
Anyway, people seem way cooler saying everything will suck and fail hard, rather to seem like a fanboy and expect good things to come out of something.</div></div><hr />

Just let them copy. Not one story is ever unique. The only unique stories are the oldest ones. Even SW wasnt that unique, in short terms it was &quot;prince rescues the princess&quot; in space movie and yet it was a very good movie. Most stories pick up elements from other stories and yet they succeed.</div></div><hr />

I'd be upset if they tried to make a gritty/dark Warcraft movie. Warcraft has never been gritty or dark (except now in Wotlk). Yes, it's had its dark moments with all the demons, undead and betrayal but not as gritty as, let's say, Doom. Dark=/=good.<br />
<br />
They do have to appeal to a large group of people for this movie. Sort of make it a bit mainstream. I highly doubt Blizzard would allow the movie to change too much of the overall Warcraft feel or lore. Comparing Doom to Warcraft is a tad weird though. Doom has nowhere near as much lore as Warcraft does. Doom 3 is so far the only Doom game that has a bit of a storyline but that's pretty much it.</div></div><hr />

You have no idea. I've been following the Warhammer world since the 80s, and it's one of the richest and most unique fantasy worlds ever created.<br />

You have no idea. I've been following the Warhammer world since the 80s, and it's one of the richest and most unique fantasy worlds ever created.<br />
<br />
I don't know Warhammer pretty well, but I'd say, as with Star Trek, most of that is fan-driven. The provided basics are Humans good, Klingons/Orcs bad, War ensues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you put Warcraft and Warhammer close together, you don't know any of the two.<br />
<br />
Warcraft is the bastard child of the american and japanese fantasy culture.<br />
<br />
Warhammer is fantasy England done gory. Warhammer isn't what people thinks - it's brutal, classy, realistical and extremely unique in its artistry. It has nothing to do with WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
If all someone knows about the Warhammer world is what they read from a wiki, they would come to the conclusion that:<br />
<br />
&quot;The Warhammer world borrows considerably from historical events and other fantasy fiction settings. The Old World is recognisably Europe approximating to the Renaissance period - the Empire being set over what is modern Germany. Many events are lifted and modified directly from real-world history, including the Black Plague and the Moorish invasion of Spain, and others from original fantasy sources. Like Middle-earth, Warhammer's Elves are declining in population, and a Great Necromancer is reborn after defeats in his Southern stronghold.&quot;<br />
<br />
Believe that it exists in isolation all you like. It's no different than any other piece of fiction out there. Its saving grace is that it's older than the Warcraft franchise, otherwise the similarities are there if you take off the blinders.</div></div><hr />

Warcraft isn't once again Warhammer, nor Lord of the Rings. It's closer to Star Wars, it's overblown, larger than life, filled with comedy and overpowered fantasy.<br />
<br />
Let it be what it is - we don't need LotR 1.5.<br />
<br />
warcraft 3 was a very dark tale<br />
only comedy i can recall is the ending credits where old arty goes guitar hero but other than that?<br />
wow is filled with comedy -warcraft isnt</div></div><hr />

Star Wars was an acknowledged remake / tribute of Kurosawa's &quot;The Hidden Fortress.&quot; Lucas never made a secret of it.</div></div><hr />

That's how the &quot;teenage and under&quot; market is seen. This is the main reason that the Transformers movies were seen as &quot;great&quot; by them and &quot;an abomination&quot; by the people who actually watched Transformers when it was shown on television. Aim for the current market and ignore the previous one.<br />

You should either go read one of the many books out there now or go read what u can on wow wiki. I know warcraft borrows a LOT from tolkein and what not but its something different. If you feel this way go read War of the Ancients trilogy. I'd honestly like to see those made into movies, would be epic to see all the demi-gods of azeroth and what not tearing apart demons and then Malorne fighting Archimonde. <br />
<br />
But trust me when i say this w/ Chris Metzen as the writer/co-producer dont expect to be disappointed if he can write or help write another story like the book he wrote for wow or helped with the many others, this movie could be epic w/ Sam Raimi.</div></div><hr />

I really hate people that judge so fast like you. Not only you hyperbole your opinion, you base it on one movie and you didnt even catch the idea behind the movie.

Regardless of who the director is, i would be amazed, honestly be in disbelief, if this film did well. There an insane chance that it will sink and be a joke, much like the dragonball movie. If you think any of the spiderman movies were somethign amazing something is wrong with you, they were decent, they weren't spectacular by any means. The only thing that even is shown about this post is that someone from the dark knight will be helping with this, which the dark knight was much better of a movie than all of Sam Raimi's film, if you argue with that your retarded. There is an extremely large margin that seperates good movies and decent movies. Ultimately despite everything i can only imagine the movie will do bad, because i can't think of any movie to date except for transformers possibly that has had the visuals to actually do a storyline justice like that of WoW. <br />
<br />
P.S. to everyone going on about spiderman, spiderman was far from an amazing movie, the action scenes were decent, but nothing to stop and rewind and watch it again. some of the visuals were pretty nice, but it's nothing amazing, the whole movie series lacks the underlying tone that fightclub, or the dark knight had. And to defend transformers, wtf where they supposed to do with the movie the second time around, of course its gonna be a remake of the first one pretty much, visually it was spectacular.</div></div><hr />

Sooo, you're allowed to say movies suck, but other people aren't? Interesting inflated sense of self importance there!<br />
<br />
Spiderman 1 was terrible... So bad in fact that I was dragged to see it with family when it first came out and my brain has quite literally blocked out most of the movie. I think I would have rather sat and stared at a wall for two hours, to be honest. I didn't even bother to watch Spiderman 2, but from the clips of it I've seen when other folks have been watching it, it seems like that was a wise choice. The writing was bad, and the acting was worse. The only thing it even remotely had going for it was shiny effects; funny how some people mistake shinies for quality... All facade and no depth.<br />
<br />
The WoW movie... Is going to be terrible; I'm calling that now. Maybe even Dungeons-and-Dragons-movie-terrible, if such a thing is possible... Certainly it'll be Dungeon-Siege-movie-terrible, which is nearly but not quite to that level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apart from that... <br />

Well, I like so called &quot;popcorn&quot; movie... I enjoyed Transformers 2 (Don't hit me!!), and when I go to the movie theater, I like to be blown away by special effects and actions scenes... Otherwise, why pay an already too high price to see something on a big screen, when you just have to wait 4 months to get it on DVD? <br />
<br />
Especially in Europe... Very rarely I don't jump over 3 rows of seats to grab someone's cellphone that he dared to answer during the movie and stuff it in his mouth.... So Movies that I go and see in the theater HAVE to blow the last few neurones I have left in my brain</div></div><hr />

Thrall will be in the movie. It will be told primarily from the Alliance point of view The time of the movie is set about 1 year before World of Warcraft begins. The film is mainly about cultures in conflict. It won't be an adventure movie like LoTR, more of a war film.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because:<br />
<br />
A) Blizzard is keeping a close watch on it. I.e. If THEY dont like it, it wont be published.<br />
B) The thing that makes game-based movies fail is that the directors take the game's story and make a movie around it, this is often so complicated that they will miss key elements wich made the game good. <br />
But if you make a movie in the universe of that game, you can put in all the awesome stuff that it has to over and still have your own storyline.<br />
Remember that its the universe that makes a game good, not the story. (except for adventures, but no one plays those anymore)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
C) Its not Uwe Boll directing it...<br />
<br />
Now there is one thing that would make it bad for me. And that is if they cast actors with only looks and no skills. I actually can see any wide known actor fit in any role. giev unkown talent!! Maybe warcraft the movie will give us the new John Cusack or Samuel L Jackson!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats the great thing about the internet, if no one listens to you whining IRL, might as well do it on the internet.</div></div><hr />

It's all about being old school. You dont know what it is, then gtfo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nowadays you get some meh writers, a meh script, but some good actors and call it a movie. Certain actors alone bring in x millions of dollars a film, that's why their paid so much. For christ sake, when I see a preview for an animated film and I see them spam all these celebrities names who did the voice overs I ask myself, &quot;We're not seeing the actor/actress so why the hell did they waste so much money using them?&quot; Because people will go see a movie for the sole reason of it having their favorite actor in it. So what am I getting at?<br />
<br />
Well for starters how many people play WoW? WoW, whether you play it or not, based on its popularity has become one of the most notable games ever. People who don't play it know what it is. People who don't know what a video game is know what WoW is. So for starters, the WoW core base is going to go see the movie. Now add on top of that all their friends and family that will go see it with them. As far as celebrities go, its all undetermined but obviously at the minimum some popular B-A list actors that will bring in millions more. So what are we looking at here? A box office hit. Its not going to matter if the movie is good or bad, its going to make money regardless.<br />
<br />
The only way I see this movie actually being good will take 2 things. One is a gimme. Blizzard pampers its stuff. Its annoying and slow but in the end they deliver some pretty damn good results. I expect they'll do nothing less with this movie regardless if Rami is directing it or not. Blizzard has his balls in a vice, so if he starts trailing off on the path of fail, they will slowly but surely get him back on track. Lastly, Blizzard better set aside a large pile of money and not think pinching pennies is an option with this project. Most of the video game movies were so terrible to begin with because their budgets were so small.<br />
<br />
The popular saying, &quot;You have to spend money to make money&quot; isn't really applicable to WoW because of its preexisting popularity. If they want this movie to be GOOD though, they will definitely have to spend money to break the video game to movie curse.</div></div><hr />
