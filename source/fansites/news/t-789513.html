It's because Garrosh has played Minecraft and has learned the hard way to always build with stone.<br />

O yeah, make the rest of the event so horribly boring that a mediocre end seems epic. Sorry won't work I've been on the ptr and I can tell you a random invasion every 2-3 hours that leads to bosses I have killed a million times before this event is NOT the definition of epic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rukh</div><div class="date">2010-11-13, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to learn more about this dwarven shaman. I understand that dwarves are getting shamanism and that's cool and all, but it seems weird to suddenly introduce a dwarf shaman that's already wise in the ways of shamanism, indicating a long life of study and probably a whole culture of shamanism that goes along with it.<br />
<br />
It would have made a lot of sense if instead they had said the dwarves started learning from the Draenei. I think that would be neat. It would be like the spread of a new religion. We'd watch it from the prophet to new tribes and civilizations.<br />
<br />
But they didn't do that. I guess what they're saying is that the Wildhammer have always had a culture of Shamanism. That's all fine and well but it's a little weird, because the wildhammer haven't been that obscure. They've been pretty close to the Alliance for a long time now. The main alliance base in Shadowmoon is built by the Wildhammer, the wildhammer train the gyphons the alliance uses for their transportation since forever, and they've always been alliance friendly in the Hinterlands since vanilla and heck, since WC2 I guess?<br />
<br />

What was the point of throwing in that Dwarf shaman in nagrand for ally quest givers to come to. Did they worry incase ally players QQed about there not being anything related to alliance in this chain, so they retconned in a character NOT EVEN IN THE SHATTERING to make them feel that were part of it? <br />
<br />
Its amazing how often the game screws up its own lore.</div></div><hr />

There was QQ last week because the Alliance got one more quest than the Horde so yes people would of cried.<br />
Also it's not like the Dwarf Shaman was a big lore killer or something.</div></div><hr />

I understand that dwarves are getting shamanism and that's cool and all, but it seems weird to suddenly introduce a dwarf shaman that's already wise in the ways of shamanism, indicating a long life of study and probably a whole culture of shamanism that goes along with it.<br />
<br />
It would have made a lot of sense if instead they had said the dwarves started learning from the Draenei. I think that would be neat. It would be like the spread of a new religion. We'd watch it from the prophet to new tribes and civilizations.<br />
<br />
But they didn't do that. I guess what they're saying is that the Wildhammer have always had a culture of Shamanism. That's all fine and well but it's a little weird, because the wildhammer haven't been that obscure. They've been pretty close to the Alliance for a long time now. The main alliance base in Shadowmoon is built by the Wildhammer, the wildhammer train the gyphons the alliance uses for their transportation since forever, and they've always been alliance friendly in the Hinterlands since vanilla and heck, since WC2 I guess?<br />
<br />
That just makes it strange that suddenly *now* there is some dwarf shamans showing up, when this signifies they should have been around forever. You'd think that something that powerful would have shown up as warriors in wars. Shamanism is a powerful thing.<br />
<br />
The Wildhammer clan has always been part of the alliance, not just &quot;pretty close,&quot; now however, after the events take place which will probably happen at the end of this quest chain leading to the cataclysm, a new council for Ironforge must be formed, and the Wildhammer clan actually becomes a part of the Ironforge. With that in mind remember, when you make an alliance dwarf, you don't make a Wildhammer dwarf, you make an Ironforge dwarf, but now the Wildhammwer clan has joined with Ironforge and when you create an Alliance dwarf, you can create either one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the story, hence the reason I read 'the shattering' great book and a good read. Far more interesting than the game has been for almost 6 months now. Honestly if they had put out all the quests at once we would have seen the story develop in front of us, I don't even remember what phase one was about, do you? Then 2 weeks after that have actual invasion of the world. Have natural disasters happen all over the world, tornado's, tidal waves and such, show some devastation of the earthquakes. Right now if I were to look at this from an rp standpoint, nothing honestly looks wrong. And the actual invasions happen so rarely that many players won't even see them. And even fewer will take part in them after the first time. You cannot honestly tell me that this &quot;event&quot; is more interesting than say hallows end was the first time or whatever in game holiday event you like. These events happen once every two years, they should be epic they should pull us all into the story.</div></div><hr />

First off good for you for canceling your account, that means i dont have to read your whining in the trade chat. And two your demand for all the quests all at once is rather weak in all of history has there even been a war finished in a day so get with the picture it doesnt happen over night the invasion has to progress not just shoot outa gods backside hope you find a new game to go cry and bother them for a while.<br />
<br />
Those who are excited bout the event i feel you been with the game since the beta and found that this event leaves me wanting more but like any good story teller its taunts me with subtle clues and cant wait to see the grand finish to the end :p</div></div><hr />

Yeah whats trade chat?<br />
<br />
Did you even bother reading what I wrote....my guess is reading is a little hard for you so I'll give you a pass on that one. And what war do you speak of? Outside of a few doom and gloom people what war are you fighting? And I have a question for you. If this even &quot;end&quot; flops will you call out blizzard for making a bad event?<br />
<br />
My guess is no, people like you are the reason why wow is going downhill. You refuse to push for the best. instead you are happy with mediocre and you will receive mediocre. If you are a real fan of blizzard you would push for them to create the best and when they don't produce the best you let them know it and force them to produce the best. Blizzard is a good company with a history of doing great things. Is it a crime to want them to be the best they can be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arizona passed a law giving police the right to stop anyone and require them to produce proof that they are in the country legally. Basically, if you're a cop and you see a brown skin person you can force them to provide proof or take them to jail. They can stop people strictly off suspicion. And given the area of the country, it's not like they're gonna harass white people. Generally, people who are against this law call it the, &quot;papers please law&quot; or &quot;show me your papers law&quot;. I think it got struck down by a judge though. I haven't kept up on it.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I'm hoping phase 4 is saturday or sunday. I'm hoping the shattering takes place by the 23rd. I'd like at least 2 weeks to level my new warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And for those that might be confused or having trouble one possible reason might be because the Ironforge to Nagrand quest is different than the ones the guards near the auction house give you to search the citizens. Not sure if you have checked that or are thinking that the Nagrand is linked to Stormwind.</div></div><hr />

This is just &quot;do lame quest&quot; over and over.<br />
<br />
The zombie event began quite 'boring' and uneventfull. Even at it's final phase I never quite got the impression it was something worth to write about. Just some Ziggurats in the air with brainless undead roaming about that aren't attacking or invading at all with Kel'thuzad or the Lich King using thrashwords.There really was not much of a build up at all because of all of a sudden there were zombies around here and there despite us being succesfull getting a defense/cure against it. It made no sense at all. <br />

No, it's 'Eure Papiere bitte' (checked on http://de.wowhead.com/quest=27741 ).<br />
<br />
'Eure' is more medieval german when you use it for one person, perhaps compared to 'Thy' in english. A policeman in germany today would say 'Ihre Papiere bitte', which is like 'Your papers please, Sir'.<br />
<br />
Oh yes, the event seems lame so far... perhaps those quests are just made extremly casual, the pre-expansion quests before where much more fun, but also much more grinding.</div></div><hr />

I understand that dwarves are getting shamanism and that's cool and all, but it seems weird to suddenly introduce a dwarf shaman that's already wise in the ways of shamanism, indicating a long life of study and probably a whole culture of shamanism that goes along with it.<br />
<br />
It would have made a lot of sense if instead they had said the dwarves started learning from the Draenei. I think that would be neat. It would be like the spread of a new religion. We'd watch it from the prophet to new tribes and civilizations.<br />
<br />
But they didn't do that. I guess what they're saying is that the Wildhammer have always had a culture of Shamanism. That's all fine and well but it's a little weird, because the wildhammer haven't been that obscure. They've been pretty close to the Alliance for a long time now. The main alliance base in Shadowmoon is built by the Wildhammer, the wildhammer train the gyphons the alliance uses for their transportation since forever, and they've always been alliance friendly in the Hinterlands since vanilla and heck, since WC2 I guess?<br />
<br />
That just makes it strange that suddenly *now* there is some dwarf shamans showing up, when this signifies they should have been around forever. You'd think that something that powerful would have shown up as warriors in wars. Shamanism is a powerful thing.<br />

I fully agree, instead of a normal dw0rf, they should have one of the earthen/frostborn shamans, someone skilled n wise! But oh noes, Cata must move away from Wotlk so we have to lorelol come with a no-name dw0rf master shaman out of nowhere...who had maybe a year of practise or something..<br />
But going to TBC Outlands is just peachy.<br />

I deleted my cache, disabled addons and tried the repair tool but nothing changed.<br />

It also seems to be a account wide problem. I tried 2 chars on the same server and it doesnt show up on both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously its giving people plenty of time to get stuff done, leaving no &quot;not enough time to do stuff qq&quot; at the end<br />
At the same time, least they have the option to speed the chain of events up if it suits them... if they went with the chain too quickly, there would be no way to undo the mistake<br />
<br />
Depends how you look at it I guess... I'm more concerned with server stability than a few quests I can get done in 10 mins... rather have the slow pace than sit there staring at a world server down screen</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PennyRust</div><div class="date">2010-11-13, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a theory as to why some who proclaim the zombie invasion to have been the greatest event in all of WoW. It had to do with being able to cause mass chaos and griefing. During the Wrath zombie event many loved the ability to go above and beyond just pissing off the opposite faction and being able to do the same to their own. How many times for shits and giggles did people go out of their way to travel to every small quest hub and village for the purpose of infecting every NPC and unsuspecting player in the vicinity? Questing/leveling in all it's forms came to a complete halt, and world pvp took center stage with the ability to infect and kill everyone in your own faction. Repair bills went through the roof. Those are the fond memories many speak of, the ability to grief every damn person they came across, all for the lulz. <br />
<br />
TL;DR Zombie invasion = Good Grief Charlie Brown<br />
<br />
I'm enjoying the story of the Pre Cata events. I do wish there were a few more quests here and there, this is affecting the entire whole of Azeroth yet Org and SW are really the only places any questing is happening. I realize it's to draw people to those cities that will be central hubs in Cataclysm, but other cities have important changes coming also.</div></div><hr />

This is a lore activity. Just because you know what is to come, you have to think, the citizens of SW and Ogri do not know what is to come. These people have no idea that Deathwing is on his way to change the face of Azeroth forever. Think about it. If all of a sudden your daily life is interrupted by earthquakes every 30-45 min., you will start to worry, perhaps panic. <br />
<br />
Do the quests, read the quests, enjoy the lore. Stop the complaining and enjoy watching the citizens be scared, know they think their very lives hang in the balance. Personally, I cannot wait to see the King of IF turned into diamond and his daughter comes back with a baby to take over the ruling. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arizona passed a law giving police the right to stop anyone and require them to produce proof that they are in the country legally. Basically, if you're a cop and you see a brown skin person you can force them to provide proof or take them to jail. They can stop people strictly off suspicion. And given the area of the country, it's not like they're gonna harass white people. Generally, people who are against this law call it the, &quot;papers please law&quot; or &quot;show me your papers law&quot;. I think it got struck down by a judge though. I haven't kept up on it.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I'm hoping phase 4 is saturday or sunday. I'm hoping the shattering takes place by the 23rd. I'd like at least 2 weeks to level my new warrior.<br />

What was the point of throwing in that Dwarf shaman in nagrand for ally quest givers to come to. Did they worry incase ally players QQed about there not being anything related to alliance in this chain, so they retconned in a character NOT EVEN IN THE SHATTERING to make them feel that were part of it? <br />
<br />
Its amazing how often the game screws up its own lore.<br />

I also dont think the quest climax is going to be all that epic,probably just some elemental boss to gank which drops some crappy piece of loot that nobody will wear anyway.<br />

When i first read about the whole event chain i expected (hoped) for hordes of elementals totally overruning the town,panic,chaos,dying lowbies,higher leveled people actually fighting for their capitals. Hopefully this will still happen. And as someone stated in one of the posts above,it would be nice to have some memento like a tabard or something that shows &quot;i was there when the world was going to shit&quot;</div></div><hr />

Every hour or so Stormwind and Ironforge will be attacked by elementals coming from portals in each of the districts. Before that citizens will start leaving the cities to get to safety and take portals out, which players can do too if they don't want to fight. After that players can queue for event bosses, four total, which are old instances bosses that are now level 80.<br />
<br />
And yes a tabard would be cool :)</div></div><hr />

The problem is most people are comparing it to the pre-wrath events. Whether you are or not, if you mention not liking this one, you will be associated. <br />
<br />

But yea... 1-2 zombies sprinkling around rarely for a couple weeks if very exciting. This event will peak much higher than any other event.</div></div><hr />
