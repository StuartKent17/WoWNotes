We agree with some of the recent discussion about Enhancement dps. We are going to hotfix a change to the Flurry talent to increase it from 25% to 30% attack speed with 5 ranks. 
 
We also agree that Enhancement may have survivability problems and understand that players don't necessarily feel they can afford the bonus Stamina from the Toughness talent, at least in PvE. We don't have an immediate change" />

Enhance sucks balls in so many aspects in PVP. And before flamers come in &quot;LOL BEASTCLEAVE RAPES FACEROLL CLASS&quot; Just look at enhance representation in arena, it has one, maybe TWO viable combos. ITs complete bullshit. It definately needs a PvP Buff to make it have more viable combos in arena other than this shaman hunter healer / warrior shaman healer.

Flurry was 30% back in old days but Blizzard nerfed it at start of 3.1 with no reason and now they are giving it back ? ???<br />
Enhance does have survivability problems yes , they should merge Toughness with some other talent or atleast make it 3 pointer &gt;:(</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping the Shaman class as a whole get's a bit of a rework for Cataclysm though (We'll see tomorrow!) They're just incredibley under-par when compared to other classes (I'm mainly speaking of PvP, but DPS-wise PvE they're not the hottest either) and I'd like to see them rise back up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Elemental Mastery + Healing Wave? Also, against a Rogue, Shamans can Thunderstorm (Ele only) + Flame Shock + Cleansing Totem + Nature Resistance Totem + Stoneskin Totem + Fire Nova.<br />
Enhance actually has to get lucky 5 times to heal themselves. Trust me, Enhance Shamans needs some PvP buffs, it's way too hard to survive through long battles, while many others can make it (points to Priests).</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure he's referring to PVE more than PVP. Enhancement has significantly lower stamina than any other melee spec, just because their item budget is divided between three primary stats instead of two.</div></div><hr />

One other thing. There are going to be some cool changes announced tomorrow. Maybe a few things that people aren't thrilled with (such as warrior rage mechanics), but there will be plenty of other cool things. I'm envisioning big changes for hybrids.</div></div><hr />

I'm still waiting for a new Dual Wield and Spirit Weapons icons. They both feature Swords so it only makes sense to change them or give us Swords imo.<br />
<br />
But ya it is fairly noticeable how squishy Enhance is compared to some melee classes, especially plate. Warriors have like 30k buffed hp or more in raids whereas Shamans are rocking what, 23k?</div></div><hr />

They are going to be taking damage from some abilities and adding new ones so that you have a real rotation and far less burst, because right now the rotation is a bit lacking and nowhere near fun.</div></div><hr />

This. My computer/internet is a piece of shit, I honestly had to swap over to ele because lat/lag made it next to impossible for me to perform where I can. Especially considering I was doing 5k on Patch25..before Ulduar came out. After that, I had to go down to a laptop and my now my best all-time is only like 6k... /tear</div></div><hr />

Take what you can get. This buff is obviously in response to the trend that was started when they buffed Frost DKs. The number of Enhance that suddenly lost their raid spots to Frost DKs must have alarmed Blizzard. Flurry is just an easy spot to buff to give them more damage.<br />
<br />
Survival talents are available as GC points out but Enhance can't afford to use them because they don't do enough damage. Even if they buffed the damage more so enhance could use the survival talents. the majority of them wouldn't take them. They would try to squeeze more DPS and they would complain other classes don't need to take survival talents.<br />
<br />
Why not add stamina to Shamanistic Rage? It gives a permanent 5% stamina and still does what it does now. It gives enhance a survival bonus for a survival talent they turned into a DPS talent. It's a temp fix anyway so why not?</div></div><hr />

As for the flurry buff, it's just like always...we're just getting a nerf back. Shaman never really get buffs, just reverted nerfs. :(<br />

And the drawback is we're losing Poison/Disease cleanse in Cata, which makes me very sad :( lol</div></div><hr />

Demo lock or another elemental shaman in the raid means you can use fire elemental and fire dps totems.<br />
And that's &quot;alot&quot; of bonus DPS.<br />

I think the problem is enhancement has more room to screw up than others.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, the problem is low dps relative to the other melee specs. There's also the survivability thing, the thing where our dps drops off a cliff when we have to move :)<br />
<br />
I push that, but we have a 10% buff in ICC at the moment, and even with those numbers im still 14th on the dps charts, above the tanks but below everyone else. And my gear is better. And i try harder than they do. And im awesome. And my poop smells like sunflowers.</div></div><hr />

every of these is a &quot;ok&quot; idea. But your doing a classic mistake. Overbuffing, shamans arent like 5k dps behind. Shaman being behind a mage, warlock and rogue is not unfair, its mostly the way blizzard has designed it.</div></div><hr />

shaman has more room to screw up than other melee specs. wether or not that is a problem for you, depends on your skill. i myself are cotent doing good with such a hard to master spec.<br />

sadly, a very good enhancement shaman still can be outdone by pretty much any other melee raid spec with comparable equip and skill.<br />

especially our crippled way of doing aoe dmg makes me sad...<br />

@ willfulharbringer: posts like yours are simply /facepalm though nerdraging about an issue through totally exagerated claims ( flurry having only a ~40% uptime ( with 70%+ crit raidbuffed ), dual flametongue doing better damage than wf/ft, or completely exxagerated suggestions like<br />
DOUBLING wf ap bonus ( would easily crit for 10k each in pvp, one-shotting people in arena )<br />
adding crit ( we´re melee crit capped ) and arp ( which gets removed in cata, and does shit for us currently )<br />
<br />
the only suggestion i´d support would be increased uptime of wolves... but only because you´re pretty much toast without em in pvp.</div></div><hr />

There must be something horribly wrong with you as a player if your Flurry only has an uptime of around 40%. I mean, you must be missing a lobe of your brain if your Flurry uptime is under 95% on a single target. I don't even get as low as 40% on Putricide or Valithria, and those are some really bad fights for Enhancement. That up there is 98% for 5 minutes. 5 minutes is a pretty average fight length.<br />

Maybe he didn't stack crit? I have an uptime of 70% or so I think, though I don't pay too much attention to it. And I'm pretty sure WF/FT is the way to go, there are countless theorycraft threads on this.<br />
<br />
I'm actually a bit surprised, I regularly kick butt on dps meters (often 1st in pugs, got up to 3rd in a guild run last week). The times when I drop to tank level are most often when I'm not paying attention or doing something wrong (running too much on Ony, poorly timed transition on Lady DW, etc.) Also, there are plenty of tricks to keep dps high once you've got the basic rotation down. Don't unload your full rotation on that trash mob on gunship, it will die quickly. Use your AOE fire totem, it makes happy large numbers appear on your screen. Finally, between wind shear and purge and cleansing totem and BL I bring utility to the table. <br />
<br />
To sum up, I don't think we need much of a buff. Then again, I don't play with many Frost DKs.</div></div><hr />

I would assume, since I can't really think of any enhancement shaman that stacks crit. Especially considering how the crit cap is screwing us right now. That was just with ICC gear, gemmed with JCer gems for expertise and stacking a ton of haste. No extra crit.</div></div><hr />

Is this for real? It's the exact other way around, elemental shamans are outdpsing enhancement shammies by miles if they're just a slight bit competent. If your elemental shammies are only pulling out 7-8k then something is wrong. <br />
<br />
I knew about the survivability problems but because i rarely die before the other melee, then unlike them enhancement shamans have to think like humans and not be like headless baboons popping cloak and other abilities by instinct</div></div><hr />

Is that sarcasm? Also an honest question. Have you never run anything without one of your decked guild tanks or without rogues/hunters to help? <br />
<br />
If it's outside my guild runs, I frequently have to pay attention to my threat, and if it's a fight where you need two tanks to be up on threat, it's a little dangerous to boost up to second just so you can wind shear.</div></div><hr />

I'm already topping meters in my guild doing 12k+. And I everyone else in my guild are good players too with equal gear. But I guess we don't have any Frost DK's so I'm not worried about being replaced.<br />
<br />
One thing I do agree with is we need more PvE survivability (aka more health). When the warriors, DK, pallies all have 10k+ more hp with plate and even rogues have more hp than us + defensive cooldowns, it means we have to be extremely aware of surroundings and have quick reactions to survive. Whereas all other melee classes can just go brain dead and rely on their health pools equivalent to the shitty tanks in PuGs i see to survive mechanics that would kill us.<br />
<br />
For example, on Deathwhisper 25 Hardmode, even with the 10% buff, I can easily die to a ghost explosion/frost bolt nova combination while I see the 40k+ hp melee classes purposefully take the hit cause they know they can survive and still have 20% health left. A quick and temporary fix would be to roll toughness into an dps talent we're already using. It wouldn't put us in line with the plate classes but the extra 3-4k hp would be welcomed.</div></div><hr />

Most of you don't know how to do your job and your dps reflects this. Please learn to play before you start posting bullcrap on some random post that got nothing to do with what you do in the game.<br />
<br />
I am really disappointed that my fellow shamans actually comes into a post that is dedicated to the enhancement spec, and it's giving the spec a buff. What happened to the shamans sticks together that have been going around for all these years? Really. Shame on you guys...<br />
<br />
To all the PvP guys, why on earth do you whine in here? Enhancement needs buffs to our dps in the PvE arena, there is no doubt. Just look at Paragon, when PARAGON! don't use an enhancement shaman on their Lich King 25man Heroic kill and posts about it saying that the spec is just too shit atm to be of a use when you want to max it, then there should be alarms ringing. They even used an enhancement shaman when they killed Lich King 10man Heroic, which most people just stack ranged on. So for them to not have one with them, yeah, alarming. <br />
<br />
and why on earth flame them for buffing us in PvE when they in the same post are saying that they will have a look at our survival talents and they are even saying that they are not working out as they want them to... Seriously...<br />
<br />
I have had some head to head with my guilds elemental shaman and I can safely say that elemental shamans are not in the top, BUT its far better then most of you noobs pretends it to be. <br />
<br />
<br />
I also just wanted to place a question here in case someone from blizzard reads it:<br />
Are we going to get more bullshit &quot;buffs&quot; like you have done in the past, like giving Stormstrike a new animation when everyone loved the old one and EVERYONE hates the new one?<br />
Are we going to see shit like this that noone but some random guys at blizzard think is cool to look at? Please say no, and please give us back the old animation.........<br />

Haha , A good one - also your shaman should check his reflexes or reroll to DK :P since if he is dying alot that means he is failing alot - even though we have lower survivability it shouldnt be an excuse for your enhance to be &quot;Entertaining&quot;</div></div><hr />

This makes me mad, like honestly. If you think elemental DPS bad, why waste your time? I've seen plenty of ele shamans do atleast 9k some fights, ever care to think that its not your best class/spec? I was ele before and i was bad, sacrificed my gear, went and regeared Enhance, and i love it and i top meters (top 5 under our #1 kitteh drood who does 40k on Deathwhispers trash lolwut?)

Just look at Paragon, when PARAGON! don't use an enhancement shaman on their Lich King 25man Heroic kill and posts about it saying that the spec is just too shit atm to be of a use when you want to max it, then there should be alarms ringing. They even used an enhancement shaman when they killed Lich King 10man Heroic, which most people just stack ranged on. So for them to not have one with them, yeah, alarming. <br />
<br />
<br />
I don't PVP, so not going to comment on the first part... but the second has pretty much nothing to do with 99.9% of the playerbase. I freely admit that I'm not at a level where I'm applying to Paragon and getting world firsts HM kills. I'm in a raiding guild, I do 10-man and 25-man raiding (though prefer 10-man). In *that particular context* I have never seen dps problems for enhance as a spec. Or rather, such problems tend to go away when the person learns about their class, gets good gear, downloads SnA, and learns the fights. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and why on earth flame them for buffing us in PvE when they in the same post are saying that they will have a look at our survival talents and they are even saying that they are not working out as they want them to... Seriously...<br />
<br />
<br />
see that would be great. I don't mind a bit more survival in PvE, though technically we don't need it. Like another previous poster said,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...it means we have to be extremely aware of surroundings and have quick reactions to survive. <br />
<br />
<br />
...yeah, awareness of surroundings and quick reactions are some of the skills you need to raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They realize that Wind Shear and Windfury Weapon share the same icon? It kinda sucks, 2 spells of the same class with the same icon..<br />

Anyway, buffs are always welcome. Since the warriors and hunters from my guild got 264 weapons I can't top dps anymore T_T</div></div><hr />

<br />
While this was done before the 10% buff was put into place (and before the buff to Frost that took it over enh) it gives a fairly good idea of how the specs were sitting relative to each other. Overall Ele sits 14th and Enh 16th out of ~16 raid viable DPS specs. Although on individual fights obviously that can differ with Enh going as high as 10th and as low as 18th. So really if people here are smashing Ele all the time and coming top three in your own raids you need to tell the other DPS to pick it up. <br />
<br />
Enh pretty much got dumped by min maxing guilds after the frost DK buff as they really don't bring anything to raid assuming there's another shaman in for hero/lust as the other specs that provide the same buffs as enh all also bring higher DPS (assuming everyone is equally geared and skilled). If anything this buff is a reaction to that. I'm interested to see if it'll be enough. <br />
<br />
Survivability wise pve Enh has very low survivability, sure you can survive, but you have to sacrifice a lot of DPS to do it, when Enh is already very low DPS. DKs easily raid buff to 10k+ HP more than enh, Rogues raid buff to 5k+ more and have defensive cooldowns, the other melee sit somewhere in between. Given that the damage expected to be taken by melee is scaled to healthpools much larger than an Enh Shamans they end up being overly squishy or just doing bad DPS.</div></div><hr />

You can't honestly use a heroic mode encounter to compare dps. Heroic modes are designed to push raids to the limit and maximize certain utility that some classes have that others don't, and while you compare encounters in LK heroic mode, the differences in them from 10m to 25m are enough to consider them completely different. If it really were that bad they wouldn't have used it on Putricide heroic mode, which they did, so that just shows you that encounter designs for heroic modes are in no way a true test of dps/utility and shouldn't be considered as basis for arguments stating a class has poor dps/utility. <br />
<br />
Enh shaman dps is fine, the mechanic they're changing is going to be better as they want it to be up more consistently, just because they add 5% more haste to it doesn't mean enh shaman dps is bad, it's just a minor buff that may push our dps up another percent or two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm aware, but again you can't really use heroic modes to judge a class/spec validity because they will be min/maxing the raids because they are heroic modes. That means if one spec does 100 more dps they'll bring it in over another spec. Now I do agree that enh shaman HP could be a popular reason as to why this may occur and that does need to be looked at, but again using just heroic modes as your basis for this isn't valid because of the circumstances pertaining to them.</div></div><hr />

Well the table I linked earlier also says enh are last of the DPS on average in the normal modes as well, and bring lower DPS than the specs that bring the same buffs. In heroic modes the min maxing is more noticable sure, but isn't that actually a good indication of which classes/specs are struggling to keep up and need some help? If a spec like Enh is consistantly being left out the devs should be asking why and adjusting them to be competative, which they just haven't been since the Frost dk buff.</div></div><hr />

Since when dps have surv problems in PvE?... Or you raid w/o raid (aoe) healers? Or you didnt use urs own heals?..Our dps was and will be less then clear dps classes can do. It was, it is and it will be.<br />

<br />
Heroic modes are a good judge of which classes are on top more, but it can also be very deceiving as well. Consider that, as I recall, Paragon used quite a few paladins with aura mastery spec'd in order to do LK 25m heroic mode, situations like that take it out of context. <br />
<br />
We're also not really talking about astronomical differences here as well. If a class/spec were more than 2k dps behind another I'd tend to agree that they need a buff, but honestly at this point anything less than that is in need of minor buffs at best and not really that important imo, especially considering how drastically some of these classes/specs will change in cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Also, to note, take a look at the thread that the table you posted is in at the sixth or seventh post down a poster makes an excellent point. The sample size can be extremely misleading due to bringing multiples of pure dps classes as well as gear and buff bias that effects the raids involved. Just something to consider when viewing the table.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Survivability problems in ICC stem around having around 5k hp less than the other melee (and yes being in melee range is a HUGE difference in terms of raid damage taken) as well as an enh shaman's primary survivability tool being completely negated due to it being a major dps increase for the class in t10.</div></div><hr />

We have same hp as other classes (lets pass those &quot;no, we are low at hp!&quot; theme - hunters have same hp as we do, for example) while we cant absorb damage like mages, rogues, hunters etc. But on my realm i saw no enhance who complain about it - they just raid and say &quot;well, we have some problems.. but who dont?..its not so critical as it can be :)&quot;<br />

Those hunters and other ranged classes who have similar HP are also at ranged, which is a considerable difference. And no adding more stam isn't simple, as you stated we're not the only ones who use mail and hunters don't need the extra hp. They also have to keep gear consistent, and the primary reason mail gear has less stam on it than leather and plate is because it has int in it's place. There's a balancing issue there you really have to be careful of before you make 'simple' changes.</div></div><hr />

As for PvP...yez it's true we need some rework. A fear totem that pulses every 4-5 seconds would be nice or something like that. We need rework for arena matches and bgs. Not THAT much, just a couple of pvp skills / spells that are not a headache to use.<br />

Paragon did LKhc w/o enh shaman. What makes u think that 5% haste will change their minds (and every other hardcore raiding guild's plans) to include an enhancement shaman?<br />
<br />
(P.S. the 4 totems and the buffs from some of the totems can be brought to the raid by a resto shaman and some other classes aswell...)<br />
<br />
Since we are not a pure dps class our dps SHOULD NOT be above this of pure dps classes (a.k.a. huntards / rogays / Mages / warcocks etc) BUT at least we SHOULD have something that a raid SHOULD NOT MISS. Unleashed rage 10%...miah too little it seems. Maybe if it was like 5% dmg or 10%ap + sp or something more, something that everyone would REALLY count and look forward.<br />
<br />
I dont say that I don't like it, yes it's nice to have it back to 30%. Nice. But it won't solve the problem of enh not getting a spot.</div></div><hr />

(P.S. the 4 totems and the buffs from some of the totems can be brought to the raid by a resto shaman and some other classes aswell...)<br />
<br />
Since we are not a pure dps class our dps SHOULD NOT be above this of pure dps classes (a.k.a. huntards / rogays / Mages / warcocks etc) BUT at least we SHOULD have something that a raid SHOULD NOT MISS. Unleashed rage 10%...miah too little it seems. Maybe if it was like 5% dmg or 10%ap + sp or something more, something that everyone would REALLY count and look forward.<br />
<br />
I dont say that I don't like it, yes it's nice to have it back to 30%. Nice. But it won't solve the problem of enh not getting a spot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, the problem is not the Single Static Target Damage like on Saurfang, where the ~4% haste would push us a little bit, the problems are the shity to handle AE abilitys and our damge on movement fights - thats the reasons why we have allinall the lousiest ICC performence of all classes. Realy every other melee has extra movementspeed or other abilitys or both ...we have abselut nothing compareable = worst Melees lightyears behind.<br />
And our survivability won´t be better with die HP of a rogue , not in situation like pdok Twins or other heroic bossfights were tons of damage are incoming.<br />
<br />
I would make the wolfform for every shaman instant and indoors useable, that would give us compareable Movementspeed and as a wolf we should get 30% less damage or something.<br />
<br />
We want our old WF Animation, higher totemrange and a nicer gameplay overall, to renew lightningshields or magamatotem in every 6-7 styles cycle - sucks. Our ae handling sucks. I m pissed this buff doesn´t solve anything.<br />
<br />
sry for my shity english ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats your point?<br />
<br />
<br />
This is about enhancement shamans. I am sure all the above speccs have their forums ti discuss why they were not there.<br />
ALSO some of the speccs you mention are not for PvE.<br />
ALSO I don't care about other classes and speccs, we talk about enh shaman buff here and if this buff is enough to boost their dps and get them a spot to the raids.<br />
So that's my point :)<br />
<br />
(P.S. Copy paste your question to the appropriate forums if you want to get an answer :D)</div></div><hr />

His / my point were that Paragon went out and said that they could have brought all the other specs, the only spec they saw no reason for bringing were the elemental and enhancement shamans, since they would only bring what they already had, just in a worse package.</div></div><hr />

You know you can choose what icon you want when you make a macro if you so choose? My macro for stormstrike still uses the old SS icon before they changed it. If you really want a different icon, change it yourself foo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The guilds you are talking about are leagues ahead of most others. The reason for this is because they have better players. And also they min/max down to the smallest deatial. In that aspect they felt enhance was not needed. Could they have done it with an enhance shaman? I'm pretty sure they could have. So long as the enhancement shaman is up to the level of the rest of the guild.<br />
<br />
If they in fact did said that they dropped the enhance on purpose for the reasons you gave, does that justify a buff? The reasons yes. Because Paragon said it? No. If there is a class that can be preferred over another class by the community as a whole because of DPS/survivability then something is wrong, because that means that said class/spec is not performing in-line with other specs A.K.A not balanced.</div></div><hr />

Since Lich King 25 Heroic is the only fight in the game at the moment that require this kind of maxing, it is only natural that we use this fight to point out the flaws of our class / spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, Retpallys does a hell of a lot dmg and burst, but they are pretty much worthless in pvp (solo) since they cant put any pressure at all on the opponent.(Yes i know rogues and warriors can be easy kills.) Solo~ they suck, but they have alot of good defensive cooldowns they can provide for their team-mates. I would like to see more good solo abilitys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is precisely the point!<br />
<br />
1. With the buff changes in Wrath, it is no longer absolutely necessary to bring class X for buff Y as class Z can also provide buff Y.<br />
<br />
2. It is impossible for Blizzard to balance out class DPS exactly without giving everyone the same abilities<br />
<br />
3. The new philosophy is to have pures do more dps than hybrids but within a small enough gap that for all but the most hardcore players, &quot;bring the player not the class&quot; applies.<br />
<br />
This thread actually reflects that pretty well. Some enh top charts, others lag behind. This is going to be the case except in the top 5% of the guilds, or less. So unless you're in that top 5%, your dps is much more a function of your skill than of your class' abilities, and this buff most likely will not affect you (you're either very good and already topping charts or you have a lot to learn and are sitting around tank level) except in that tiny number of cases where (as was calculated in a previous post) you're 200 or so dps behind a whole bunch of dps and are somehow being sat because you are consistently just that little bit behind.<br />
<br />
If you *are* in the top 5%, then straight up damage buffs or nerfs will affect your raid slot, but they're still somewhat random as, as it has been pointed out numerous times, single target stationary dps is where we do pretty well. Movement related abilities might provide a more useful buff, but only in the case where Blizzard has hard evidence that our dps drops off due to movement significantly more than that of other melee given equal skill. <br />
<br />
To sum up, I'm not sure exactly why we need a buff, how big the impact of this buff will be, and whether it will be mostly erased by cata and upcoming changes. <br />
<br />
Finally, a) as someone pointed out, that EJ chart is based on highly biased data, and should be considered with much suspicion (and note that even the lowest non-zero row on the chart has PLENTY of dps for every fight in icc 10 man normal). b) I'd like to echo another previous post and say that our survivability is mostly dependent on our skill and healer skill. This isn't Kara, where you needed 7k HP or you died on some boss fights, no question about it. Or rather, those limits are there, but they're way lower than our 23k HP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wat<br />
<br />
Ret pallies are one of the only classes that seriously give me a headache. Get stunned, pop SR to take 30% less damage. Break out of stun around 50%. Try to smack the pally around to build up MW stacks so I can quickly heal. Fighting continues. I blow wolves and racial for a quick damage burst. Just as it's over, boom. Pally bubbles and LoH <br />
(or heal spam). I'm now down in the red against a fully healed pally who can't take damage but can still smack me upside the head. Try to run, pally keeps up. Either go ghost wolf or if feral spirit is still up, use spirit walk. That gets me far enough to hopefully heal up and replant totems. All CC is ineffective--Frost Shock (talented), Earthbind, hex. It's all useless. All I can do is try to heal. That requires standing in place where the pally can still beat me up and knock my casting back. If I managed to heal up it's usually still over because the pally will just stun again and this time I'm full out of defensive and offensive CDs.<br />
<br />
I think paladin is the only class that can be completely invincible to all damage or status effects while still being able to hurt others. That's insane on its own. Coupled with the fact that they can self heal... it's not horribly OP because they are still beatable, but that kind of defense/offense synergy is completely unique.<br />
<br />
I don't know what its like against other classes, but Pallies and Rogues who get the jump on you are the only classes that make me want to punch through my monitor. Other classes can still run me into the ground, but these two are the only ones that I will feel helpless against.</div></div><hr />

or stop your whine and wait for all the buffs to be unveiled? Can you really not wait so you have to enter every other shaman buff post that is not for your spec and tell them that your spec needs the buff more? Do you really want flurry in the elemental tree? Wouldn't be a problem for us enh shamans, I just don't see what use you elemental shaman have of it. It's even said earlier here, elemental and enhancement are both below the other classes, both needs buffs. The elemental spec have had the attention now for SEVERAL months. please, this is the first enhancement post I have seen for, I can't even remember when I last saw one.</div></div><hr />

Looked sort of the same as it does now being a Wind Tornado, but it sort of left like a windy trail behind you if you moved, and felt like it was actually swirling around you instead of this funnel like Tornado we have today.</div></div><hr />

Its pretty easy to figure out. Write down your attack speed. Go hit a dummy until Flurry procs, stop attacking and write down that speed.<br />
<br />
1-(New Speed/Old Speed)=Your haste %<br />
<br />
Short version: It wasn't last night.</div></div><hr />

I'm at work. Can't do that!<br />
<br />
But okay. That what i really wanted to know. My DPS went up compared to previous weeks, was wondering if it was due to me updating my video drivers (faster responses) or flurry buffs.</div></div><hr />
