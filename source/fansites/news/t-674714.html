I hate when people whine about tier sets. I'm trying to like this one. I really, really am trying. But so far I am just really not feeling it. And that helm is just... oh god, please tell me it's broken. Just... just broken, that's all. It'll be okay. It'll be okay...<br />

preist t10 meh its pretty good so far warlock is my fav<br />

<br />
OMG what are you talking about? That is one of the best sets I've seen for a pally in a looooong time. It's perfect for the pally. I also LOVE the priest set...omg that is great. T10 is looking to be great .... cept for the huntard tier lol. <br />
<br />
But yes at Priest...i'm so digging the helm. Paladin...the shoulders are the shiz. <br />
<br />
Come on Shaman already tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thumbs up, good change.<br />
We need more season 5 DK heroes rerolling warlock.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, I think this is really the most horrible patch in the PvE set history. Every set looks plain and boring ('cept for warlocks, which is pretty cool) compared to what you would expect from a raid for The Lich King himself! <br />
<br />
I mean the tier5 and 6 were beyond wicked, but this is just horrible.</div></div><hr />

* Hatchlings: Leaping, Darting, Razormaw, and Ravasaur Hatchlings no longer drop from their associated rare creatures. Instead, there are now rare nests that spawn which contain these hatchlings. For example, the Leaping Hatchling can now be found in Takk’s Nest rather than as a drop from Takk the Leaper.&quot;<br />
<br />
I love these hatchlings so much! And, I'm definitely thrilled if this means more chances for pet collectors to get them. I'd love for everyone to be able to have a full set. ^_^<br />
<br />
But, I will admit, I'm gonna miss the fun of hunting these rares for the drops. I don't use any addons for this sort of thing. So, when I would just be waiting them out patiently and spamming my macro, it was always really fun to see the rare's nameplate pop-up and tag them. <br />
<br />
But, more raptors for more pet lovers = very good!</div></div><hr />

Don't know what you're talking about, Rogue tier looks like one of the sweetest armor sets in the entire game.<br />

That said... man. Paladins. ...Man.<br />

Makes sense...look at the armor remnants. It is alliance T9. That and it could mean Bolvar WAS caught in the red dragons flames but not destroyed.<br />

From what I understood t10 &quot;theme&quot; is scourge, at least it seemed so. Warlocks look a bit like lich, hunters like nerubians, rogues geist and mages like those vampyre elven prince dudes from Old Kingdom and Utgarde Keep. Twin Val'kyrs had Shadow and Light side so people were hoping for val'kyr theme, but well.. As it is now it looks like some random shadow resistance set gear, rather than a set in which you'd go to defeat The Lich King...</div></div><hr />

Aye - it's definately Bolvar, looking at the current ingame WoW model of him [before 'dying'], the gold seams of his leg plate is still there as 'lavaman', as well as the layered shoulderpiece.<br />
<br />
Someone's already posted the pics, but anyway - compare:<br />

Because his pants match the Immolated Champions almost exactly, and his pants match up to Bolvar's almost exactly. Taking in account the burns and all.</div></div><hr />

But does anyone know what type of scourge pally tier is based off? Priest looks like a Cultist, but Pallies, I have no idea.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, the &quot;lavaman&quot; has the little metal clips that attach your cloak to your chestpiece melted into him, another piece of evidence leading to it being Bolvar.</div></div><hr />

Just noticed the lines going up his legs. Same as the ones in Bolvar's legplates.<br />
<br />
Feet, belt, legplates and leftover shoulder and the rags below his waist point towards the armor Bolvar was wearing before dying.<br />
Then he was torched by red dragons.<br />
Then the &quot;immolated champion&quot; appears in Yogg-Saron's brain room.<br />
And now we have lavaman, whose armor leftovers match Bolvar's... oh wait. Already said that.<br />

Definitly not Deathwing.</div></div><hr />

Well the timer resets every 10sec so not so bad.<br />
Its the same with both the caster and the melee trinkets.<br />
Sure we dont know the PASSIVE stats of the trinkets. But as long as they arent totaly bonkers the trinkets are a real joke.<br />
The melee trinkets have some intresting proccs tho but we have no idea what the proccs accually do and if u will just get 1 of em all the time or random.</div></div><hr />

i would assume the timer renews when you get hit meaning you only need to dodge 1 time every 10 sec to keep the stack up.<br />

Err fyi l2 read please, Each time u dodge an attack u get stamina for the next 10 sec, stacking up to 10 times, meaning each time u dodge u add a stack to the current stack, meaning u refresh the 10 second timer, meaning a total almost constant stacking of 270 stamina, which tbh, really isn't to bad... Also considering they got rid of those lame 'on use' trinkets from ToC badges, its quite some progress :P</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure it's supposed to be a Cultist. Could be wrong. I've heard someone say it's a Lich, but other than the color scheme I think it looks nothing like a Lich, and priests are much more Cultist like than Lich like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Compare these two to the HD quality tiers already released. Those showed up quick because they were already worked on, first time we see priest and paladin the textures aren't high quality on the armor. Wait till weeks before live, it'll become 10x as awesome to look at.<br />
<br />
2. The shoes, nuff said. Obviously they wouldn't give plate wearers slippers. Plus, notice how the green gem has an orange tip. That means that the graphic is wrong and is obivously in place of big boots.</div></div><hr />

I really hope there's a lot more work to be done on this trinket. As it works now, even if it were proccing so much that it's effectively passive it's still only about half as good as Solace of the Fallen/Defeated (which is 150/168 spell power and 128/144 mp5).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frankly, i'm pissed. I spent a good few WEEKS of constant BG'ing to get exalted with AB and WSG (hell, even from Revered to Exalted is a pain in the ass in Vindication EU) for Battlemaster. It was by far the longest part of the achievement, one of the major grindy parts of such an achievement. It was the real test of whether you could be bothered to put in the time and effort to get it (i actually got someone post on my Youtube video stating that Arena Master &gt; Battlemaster, and that Battlemaster can be earned by simply playing for 1 hour a day, and also at the same time all day long, think it was some nerdrage just because someone had something they didn't have).<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the titles will be this;<br />
Defiler &lt;Name&gt;<br />
Outrider &lt;Name&gt;<br />
Frostwolf &lt;Name&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;Name&gt; of Arathor<br />
Sentinel &lt;Name&gt;<br />
&lt;Name&gt; of Stormpike<br />
<br />
Although i could be wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree 100%, however i dont have the title.. YET..<br />
<br />
Ive been farming the past weeks like a madman.. Running Premades and whatnot.. And the rep grind is the hardest part of the Battlemaster.. Now I might aswell just wait and get it get it with 2 more achievements when the next patch hits.. *sigh*</div></div><hr />

The Priest set looks kind drab. To be honest, aside from the helmet, I actually really like the set.

It still has a Crusader-style appearance, but kind of the dirtier side of crusaders.</div></div><hr />

Some of that stuff is damn near impossible anyway, so every person in the game isn't going to have it. It isn't going to be the new Jenkins title or anything. I just looked at the other requirements for Battlemaster and was like... BLAAAAH.</div></div><hr />

Warlock - Ner'zhul<br />

Priest - Cultist/Acolyte(Cult of the Damned)<br />
Paladin - Lavaman/Bolvar<br />
Mage - San'layn<br />
Death Knight - Arthas<br />
Hunter - Anub'arak/Crypt Lord<br />
Druid - Nightmare/Valithiria Dreamwalker (if Nightmare, then its not really connected to Scourge)<br />
Warrior - Boar (not really connected to Scourge)<br />
Shaman - Remains to be seen (I'm hoping for Frostwyrm/Emberwyrm inspiration personally)<br />

Seriously, you stupid fucks just pull this shit for every tier, because you can't grow up and use common sense. You idiots complained about tier 8, yet you idiots wanted it and like it now. You idiots complained about tier 9, yet you idiots wanted it and like it now. Now you idiots are complaining about another tier that you're going to end up rolling on because you like gearing and progression.<br />
<br />
Give it weeks, 3.3 isn't coming out tomorrow, the recent paladin/priest sets are way unfinished and haven't even had a chance to fix it's bugs and show you whatever other colors it could come in.<br />

<br />
It just takes a ludicrous amount of game time.<br />
<br />
Read again: It takes ZERO SKILL to grind the rep. The rest of the achievements for battlemaster can be done in a few weeks of play, it is only the WSG/AB reps which are the cockblock for anyone who didn't play pre-BC.<br />
<br />
People QQing over the rep achievements being removed from the meta need to reexamine their stance on this game. The WSG/AB reps are stupidly tedious to grind. Congratulations, you had 500+ hours of free time available to spend grinding out games of WSG/AB over and over, have a title. Frankly you could AFK your way to that title, I see plenty of people doing it. Grats on playing pre-BC when it was way easier to grind the rep, or on having the time to play the roughly 500 or so of AB and WSG games required to get the rep to exalted, or on botting AFK overnight for a few months. Assuming an average of 10 minutes per game, that is somewhere in the region of two hundred hours of gameplay spent sitting in AB and WSG grinding out caps and wins. Depending on your battlegroup and faction it may be way more.<br />
<br />
Now you get special titles to show off that you spent the immense amount of time required to grind out games (as if Conquerer and tabards weren't enough), and the rest of us who have most or all of the other achievements for the meta but didn't want to spend another month-plus grinding out AB/WSG day in and day out get the battlemaster title. Big deal.<br />
<br />
Time does not equate to skill. If you're QQing over not being a special snowflake because now people won't be able to see you spent roughly a month of your life in nothing but AB/WSG, I pity you. :)</div></div><hr />

As to the trinket procs: The &quot;transformations&quot; one is probably not random. It will probably function a lot like Darkmoon Card:Greatness in that it will probably &quot;decide&quot; what to change you into based on some stat or other, or even on your class. <br />
<br />
Whoever the Hunter was that was complaining about this, it looks like if I'm right you'll be getting &quot;Aim of the Tuskarr&quot; (do they even HAVE a ranged attack animation?) while my ret pallie gets to be a Frost Giant. Taunka's probably for those that stack AP and not str or agil (shammies or druids are probably going to like this one.)

Does it make sense that Bolvar is Lavaman tho? Why would the Lich King turn &quot;his greaest deathknight&quot; into that? Personally I'm skeptical that it is Bolvar in that regard, but also I'm thinking it's a fact that alot of people *want* to see Bolvar as this Lavaman guy. The whole &quot;OMG THEY LOOK SO SIMILAR IN THAT SCREENSHOT&quot; thing is merely just a representation of people looking at a human-model-designed new addition to the game. Is it Bolvar? Maybe. Is it some different new human-like model added to the game? Maybe.<br />

This explanation is much less epic, but it seems to make more sense to me<br />

Also the window for selecting the race has been scaled a bit more to allow room for the goblin and worgen icons to fit in though they are not present and the background art is not visable.

Yeah to be perfectly honest, whilst i do not play a paladin, it is one of the better looking, if not the best looking set I have seen in WOTLK - for paladins. To be honest, Paladins get an awful lot of stick for there tier sets, but this one actually makes them look decent. ( No I do not play a Paladin either before some smartass gets in to say I do )<br />

On a side note. I think most of the other sets look fine. they will fix the pink in the pallies. Youre clothies look fine. The rogues look creepy as shit and make me shiver but is that a bad thing? Now, my poor hunter, who has had references of dick-out-of-forehead, unicorn blade, being made out of wood (new armor class), and looking like a boat. looks just abysmal as have a few other of our tiers. Just drab if not ugly. Poor color mixing choices. red and drab green? cmon. But now this. I will not settle on one bad comment. Behold, the mighty tier ten hunter! Upgraded into a trojan unicorn that is sea-ready. It should be the new Season 8 Armor really.

But does anyone know what type of scourge pally tier is based off? Priest looks like a Cultist, but Pallies, I have no idea.<br />

<br />
based off necromancers maybe? since both have skulls on their heads and faces showing?</div></div><hr />

Does it make sense that Bolvar is Lavaman tho? Why would the Lich King turn &quot;his greaest deathknight&quot; into that?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the Lich King we're talking about. The guy's ideal soldier is one with his guts hanging out of his chest. If Bolvar/Lavaman is powerful, I doubt that the Lich King will refuse to employ him because he's not pretty enough.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The achievements to get exalted with the Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin, and Alterac Valley factions have been removed from their respective “Master of” meta-achievements. Special titles will be offered to those who reach exalted with these factions.&quot;<br />
<br />
Frankly, i'm pissed. I spent a good few WEEKS of constant BG'ing to get exalted with AB and WSG (hell, even from Revered to Exalted is a pain in the ass in Vindication EU) for Battlemaster. It was by far the longest part of the achievement, one of the major grindy parts of such an achievement. It was the real test of whether you could be bothered to put in the time and effort to get it (i actually got someone post on my Youtube video stating that Arena Master &gt; Battlemaster, and that Battlemaster can be earned by simply playing for 1 hour a day, and also at the same time all day long, think it was some nerdrage just because someone had something they didn't have).<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the titles will be this;<br />
Defiler &lt;Name&gt;<br />
Outrider &lt;Name&gt;<br />
Frostwolf &lt;Name&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;Name&gt; of Arathor<br />
Sentinel &lt;Name&gt;<br />
&lt;Name&gt; of Stormpike<br />
<br />
Although i could be wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm as pissed as you are, spent HOURS and HOURS grinding Conqueror for Battlemaster and now Blizzard fuckers just going to give Battlemaster for free. GG, one of the few worthy titles is going to be given for free. At least I only lack 10 SoTA wins and I'll have it before all these fucking nerfs to the casuals.</div></div><hr />

I just watched the Wrathgate video several times to look at similarities between the two models. <br />
<br />
1) The first is that left shoulderpad. In the video the pad is stickingmore out and almost horizonal to Bolvars shoulder. Lavaman has his shoulder facing almost perpendicular to his shoulder. (look at the opening cut to Bolvar)<br />
2) His belt is one continuous decoration. Lavaman has a U-shape opening in the front (similar to how the T8 belts look) (Look right before video pans to militents)<br />
3) It appears that Lavaman has a type of skirt that he is trying to wear. Bolvar does not wear a skirt. He does wear a tabard that comes down a bit but not around the side. (Look while Bolvar is passing militents)<br />
4) Lavaman has a wide top part for his boots. Bolvar's boots are not that wide at the top. (after Valkres storm out of the gate, Balvar starts charging for them. Look at the one second his boots are visible)</div></div><hr />

<br />
... whoever said said Bolvar was his greatest death knight?<br />
<br />
Perhaps you are forgetting the battle for lights hope chapel at the end of the DK starting zone quests. Arthas sucks up Alexandros Mograine's soul, but it never says he consumes it or destroys it, which means its more than likely going to be us against him later in ICC.<br />
<br />
Just look at the particular heroes chosen to participate in the ICC battles.<br />
<br />
Saurfang + Muradin, for the battle on the air ships.<br />
Varian for the battle with Bolvar<br />
Darion for the battle against Alexandros<br />
And Fordring for the battle against Arthas. <br />
<br />
At least thats my theory on it.. Nothing says bolvar is the greatest DK in his army, especially since he wasnt even the greatest paladin on azeroth before his death, and it leaves the hole of what ever happened to alexandros after lights hope</div></div><hr />

after you watched the video where bolvar &quot;died&quot; you stand next to alexstrasza and korialstasz. <br />
<br />
<br />
Korialstrasz says: My Queen, do they know? <br />
Alexstrasza the Life-Binder says: No, my beloved. <br />
Alexstrasza the Life-Binder says: [Draconic] Ashj zila gul kirasath lok ante il lok buras danashj Gul gul <br />
Korialstrasz nods. <br />
Korialstrasz says: They will not. <br />
<br />
the draconic part means &quot;They must not discover the fate of the young paladin. Not yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
i dont know where, but i read that the red dragonflight use their breath to form life, not to destroy things (remember all those pretty flowers at the gate after you saw the video)..the red dragonflight burned everything down in the video..and we know, that bolvar is still alive..he must be the lavaman..<br />

I agree. The whole thing does look very shamanish to me. The broken flame shoulders. The little twist coming of the shoulders and the little leather tie thing coming down in the front. The little turquoise gems and straps look very shaman-y. The legs seem like they would look better as a kilt. Also it doesn't really look like plate to me, more like leather or mail. <br />

Idc, as a holy pally I have been going after mail all expansion anyway. <br />

I like the priest set. I can see why people think it looks a little dull but I actually think it looks very detailed and not as over the top as some of the other tier sets. <br />

It cant be Bolvar since death knights got blue eyes and are covered with frost if they are covered with anything. And Deathwing also has lava cracks and a stone body like this model.

The gold version has incomplete textures.<br />
Should have used the blue version of Paladin Tier10<br />
<br />
<br />
Or it was a joke @ paladins.<br />
Hmmm.. ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aye - it's definately Bolvar, looking at the current ingame WoW model of him [before 'dying'], the gold seams of his leg plate is still there as 'lavaman', as well as the layered shoulderpiece.<br />
<br />
Someone's already posted the pics, but anyway - compare:<br />

They really changed his looks it seems..<br />
<br />
I recall he looked cooler back in the past.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Since the leak of Arthas losing his helm when he dies. im speculating that this man bolvar aka lavaman might take the helm and bam turn into arthas. Jus an idea :-*<br />
<br />
<br />
No, because the helm has no power anymore.<br />
Arthas killed the lich king, and became the new one.<br />
And the sword eats your soul, so can't be taken by a player.</div></div><hr />

Someone said that it has an incredible amount of detail that we've never seen before. Truth is, while there are certain nice details on the armor, that brown color is REALLY boring. Also those two pieces that matter the most and characterize the whole set, head and shoulders, are VERY poorly designed. I suppose the head is bugged (even though the pink ribbon is there to stay imo ...) But the shoulders are boring. All in all it's not bad looking set. Just boring. Would be nice for t7 and not for the endgame set that's supposed to be.<br />
<br />
The priest set is also terrible. It's like they've put no effort at all in the design... <br />

We all hate you for looking so awesome in this armor including Blizzard. so they decided to only give you shitty sets from then on, you had enough! (Also the T10 helm could still make it good)</div></div><hr />

<br />
fly to quel's rest talk to elf<br />
<br />
Fly to Wyrmcrest talk to the consort, have chat about sword, kalageos appears and questions if this is right, then you get told to go get a book on swords from dalaran<br />
<br />
You get there and the other faction has it, you go to the sewers kill someone get a letter saying where it is, get ambushed on your way out and then hand it back to the contact in dalaran.<br />
<br />
Your contact sends you to get a disguise for the opposite faction and you help a cleaner do his washing like the Kaloosh quest and get your tabard.<br />
<br />
You sneak into the other factions base, get the book and take it back.<br />
<br />
You fly to Icecrown and talk to the first guy again<br />
<br />
You get ambushed by Lana'thel who tells a story that the sword belonged to her people and when the carrier died giving others time at the sunwell invasion, she took it up and brought it to northrend for revenge, her plan failed utterly and most were taken for the san'layn, the blade was broken and left and she will see too it that it is never reforged.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zong</div><div class="date">2009-10-21, 07:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It cant be Bolvar since death knights got blue eyes and are covered with frost if they are covered with anything. And Deathwing also has lava cracks and a stone body like this model. And they probably replaced the model like they did to sylvanas. My point is that this must be Deathwing.<br />
<br />
<br />
A. Not a chance.<br />
<br />
B. There's absolutely no evidence pointing toward Bolvar having to be a death knight, all thats been mentioned is that he took a long time and Arthas had to do &quot;unspeakable things&quot; to his soul. I'd say Lavaman is the result of that.<br />
<br />
Deathwing and Arthas are not on the same side, they're not putting him in Icecrown.</div></div><hr />

<br />
gonna be a bad ass fight, maybe we can save him somehow and he becomes somthing further in the storyline?</div></div><hr />

I just watched the Wrathgate video several times to look at similarities between the two models. <br />
<br />
1) The first is that left shoulderpad. In the video the pad is stickingmore out and almost horizonal to Bolvars shoulder. Lavaman has his shoulder facing almost perpendicular to his shoulder. (look at the opening cut to Bolvar)<br />
2) His belt is one continuous decoration. Lavaman has a U-shape opening in the front (similar to how the T8 belts look) (Look right before video pans to militents)<br />
3) It appears that Lavaman has a type of skirt that he is trying to wear. Bolvar does not wear a skirt. He does wear a tabard that comes down a bit but not around the side. (Look while Bolvar is passing militents)<br />
4) Lavaman has a wide top part for his boots. Bolvar's boots are not that wide at the top. (after Valkres storm out of the gate, Balvar starts charging for them. Look at the one second his boots are visible)<br />

Yet a few people can't seem to work out why this can't be Deathwing. Having looked at wowwiki, this is a boss. So if this is deathwing like some people stupidly claim, please tell me why they would put him in ICC?</div></div><hr />

Kalageos, as in Kalecgos? Couldnt find any named Kalageos but if you mean kalec then cool!<br />

And, as people said, Lavaman IS Bolvar.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valtiel</div><div class="date">2009-10-21, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It IS Bolvar. There's positively no doubt about it.<br />
<br />
The comical side is that nobody is pointing out that it makes no sense. Bolvar gets poisoned, then he sees dragons flying and them burning everything (including him) down.<br />
Makes sense with the lavaman model.<br />
<br />
Only that dragons are still there. The lich king left before Bolvar died. Alex and co. are still there, burning and watching over the place, with such a strong presence that even Alliance and Horde get debuffed with such magical effects that make unable to take a simple action as buffing or even mounting. The dragonflight has the place in check, so strongly that there's even ingame effects applied.<br />
<br />
How the hell did Arthas get Bolvar's body?<br />
<br />
Of course we can play that card that somehow between Bolvar seeing dragons burning him down and, well, dragons landing some fire immune Lich King servant sneaked up through the closed gate, snatched the body and teleported away unseen by a dozen elder dragons and untouched by an aura so strong that it prevents people to use mounts.<br />
We can, but shoddy narrative remains shoddy.<br />
<br />
Blizzard killed Bolvar to fuel the storyline of Alliance and Horde's hate for each other. Now they're picking him again and in all honesty, the logical structure of the process reminds me more of a Beautiful episode than good fantasy narrative. It makes no sense, but oh well, it's WoW I guess.</div></div><hr />

I used the only one with DisplayID, most likely the one that will be used for the player set. Will do recolors later. ^^<br />
