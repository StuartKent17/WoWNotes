Warlords of Draenor - Dark Portal Updated<br />
The Dark Portal was previously red (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4142-Blasted-Lands-Quests-and-Orgrimmar-Changes-Blue-Posts-Connected-Realms-Dark-Below) in beta, but it seems the ramp has now been turned into rubble, along with a few other tweaks.<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Female Gnome Faces<br />
The latest build made female gnomes somewhat less happy compared to the original preview (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/november/bconArtOfWoW065.jpg). Her face still does smile when doing most emotes (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/september/femaleGnomeWave.jpg). Keep in mind this is beta, so this facial expression isn't final!<br />

<br />
Warlords of Draenor - Upcoming Tank Squish<br />
Hey all. I've briefly mentioned this in tweets, but wanted to provide some more concrete info here for you. In an upcoming build, we're making some major changes to tanks.<br />
<br />
But don't freak out, tanks, this is for the better. It'd be very easy to see datamining of these changes and think the sky is falling; don't be deceived! If you do the classic &quot;scroll to my class, read datamined changes to my class only&quot;, you'll be sad and angry. And I'll be sad that you're sad and angry.<br />
<br />
The core issue that we're aiming to solve is with the power level of tanks' defensive abilities. And I don't mean their gameplay. Their gameplay is great, especially Active Mitigation; that's not changing. I mean their total defensive effectiveness. Health, damage reduction (flat, percentage, random avoidance, etc), passive and active, cooldowns, etc.<br />
<br />
Tanks have gotten a lot of power creep. A tanking specialized character should be better at tanking than a non-tanking specialized character, obviously. But by how much? 3x? 5x? 10x? It's gotten to be more like 50x or even 100x. Fun fact as a point of comparison: Most of the Mythic raid bosses (first raid tier) we've been testing deal tank damage roughly equivalent to what Heroic Lei Shen (second raid tier) did, after accounting for the squish and level difference. Some even more.<br />
<br />
So, what are we doing about it? We're effectively doing a squish to tanks defensive effectiveness, and to dungeon and raid mob damage to tanks. This list is going to sound like a big pile of nerfs, but it's important to understand that it's not. It's happening to *all* tanks, and mob damage is coming down as well, to compensate.<br />
<br />
Additionally, before anyone points it out, yes, some of these changes affect the defensive effectiveness of non-tanks. We didn't forget that; this was done consciously, because we think these changes should be made anyway, or we're considering other changes to compensate them if necessary.<br />
<br />
Here's a summary of the actual changes (please post this around, and discuss this, not the datamining which will paint a very skewed and incomplete picture):<br />
<br />
Creature damage has been retuned. In particular, the damage of creatures intended to be tanked in dungeons and raids has been drastically reduced to offset the below changes. The amount of Armor on Plate, Mail, Shields has been reduced significantly. Many tank abilities that increase maximum health have been reduced in effectiveness: Guarded by the Light, Stance of the Sturdy Ox, Bear Form, Empowered Bear Form, Blood Presence, Veteran of the Third War, Shadow of Death, Ursa Major. In most cases, the magnitudes of these effects have been reduced. Many tank abilities that passively reduce damage taken in some way have been reduced in effectiveness: Unwavering Sentinel, Improved Defensive Stance, Mastery: Critical Block, Defensive Stance, Sanctuary, Guarded by the Light, Stance of the Sturdy Ox, Bear Form, Blood Presence, Primal Fury. In most cases, the magnitudes of these effects have been reduced. Many tank abilities that provide Active Mitigation have been reduced in effectiveness: Shield Block, Shield Barrier, Shield of the Righteous, Mastery: Divine Bulwark, Bastion of Glory, Guard, Stance of the Sturdy Ox, Shuffle, Savage Defense, Pulverize, Frenzied Regeneration, Tooth and Claw, Death Strike, Rune Tap. In most cases, the frequencies or magnitudes of these effects have been reduced. Many tank abilities that provided long-cooldown temporary defensive buffs have been reduced in effectiveness: Shield Wall, Last Stand, Demoralizing Shout, Divine Protection, Guardian of Ancient Kings (Protection), Fortifying Brew, Barkskin, Bristling Fur, Survival Instincts, Might of Ursoc, Bone Shield, Dancing Rune Weapon, Icebound Fortitude, Vampiric Blood. In most cases, the durations of these effects have been reduced. Resolve has been changed to no longer scale with Stamina, only incoming damage over the last 10 sec, and its scaling rate changed.<br />
Resolve % = 100 * MAX(0, 8.5 * (1 - e^(-0.045*DamageMod)) - 1) DamageMod refers to the % of a basic equal-level creature attacking you that you've had directed at you over the last 10 sec.<br />
<br />
We understand that these changes will sound scary, but ask that you keep an open mind and try to comprehend the complete picture. Tuning may be pretty rough for a few builds as we iterate on these changes, so please be patient.<br />
<br />
I'll try to answer questions as I have time, but please understand that we're all extremely busy trying to finish and polish things over here, so time is limited.<br />
<br />
Thanks, everyone!<br />
<br />
Is the plan for tanks to still do ~70% of DPS damage? Just wondering.<br />
I don't know that we've given specific numbers, but those plans haven't changed.<br />
<br />
First thing stood out to me is that some of the long-CD abilities being altered will have an affect on Melee DPS's raid survivability.<br />
<br />
And while I will concede that in 1st teir, incidental AoE damage on the raid (melee specifically) wasn't too terrible in Mists, I'd like to know if this is something that's being kept in mind as you alter those cooldowns. Especially in the long run, as we proceed to the 2nd (and maybe 3rd) teir of raiding in WoD.<br />
Yes, it is indeed being kept in mind.<br />
<br />
I'm confused as to why these changes would be introduced near the very end of mythic testing. Would it not have made more sense to make all of these major class changes, such as the gimping of Holy Paladins and now the squishing of tanks at the beginning of mythic testing so you have more than a week or twos worth of data to play with?<br />
We'll still be doing considerable testing.<br />
<br />
I am somewhat concerned with one change. The reductions to both the power and duration of long cooldown tank CDs.<br />
We just reduced the duration of long cooldown tank CDs, except for a couple where we changed the cooldown or magnitude instead. I don't believe anything had both the magnitude and duration changed.<br />
<br />
This sounds interesting. It sounds like non-tanks will have better survivability compared to tanks. In my opinion, non-tanks should be able to take a hit or two without being one-shot while tanks can take a few more hits before they risk dying. Healing a non-tank should be doable for short periods of time, but not sustainable over a large part of an encounter, but tanks shouldn't be indestructible.<br />
<br />
That sounds like the goal, so I'm interested to see how it plays out.<br />
Indeed. <br />
<br />
Well if this is scaled with encounters, I guess it's not too bad, but how will this effect our effectiveness in PvP?<br />
We had been planning to raise the amount of damage tanks take in PvP further, but are doing this instead. We're going to see how that works out, and may leave it at 25%, or even remove it if that looks reasonable based on testing.<br />
<br />
Actually, can't edit it into the OP; post is getting too long. So, editing in a link to this post.<br />
<br />
Resolve has been changed to no longer scale with Stamina, only incoming damage over the last 10 sec, and its scaling rate changed.<br />
Resolve % = 100 * MAX(0, 8.5 * (1 - e^(-0.045*DamageMod)) - 1) DamageMod refers to the % of a basic equal-level creature attacking you that you've had directed at you over the last 10 sec. This Resolve amount is much much larger than previously. To compensate for that, baseline healing and absorption from tanks is being significantly reduced. The net result will be a curve that keeps abilities such as Word of Glory, Frenzied Regeneration, or Shield Barrier scaling roughly in parallel to other %-based abilities such as Shield of the Righteous, Savage Defense, or Shield Block; weak when fighting weak enemies, and strong when fighting strong enemies.<br />
<br />
With these changes, all that you said are the roles of a tank can be served by a DPS in defensive stance. If that puts out better DPS and we still survive, then why be a tank?<br />
<br />
The need to be very careful reducing damage done by mobs just so they can reduce our defensive ability. There is a point where a tank is no longer required and can just be done by a plate wearing dps.<br />
<br />
There is a point, but it is *extremely* far away, and we are nowhere even remotely close to that point. This isn't going to make non-tanks able to replace tanks.<br />
<br />
So if I'm understanding this correctly, at level 100, DamageMod = (damage taken in last 10 seconds) / ( 3615.3 * 10 ) ?<br />
<br />
Is the time-decay mechanism of the previous version of Resolve, in which an attack was worth 2x Resolve at the time of impact and decayed away continuously to being worth 0 Resolve after 10 seconds, gone entirely?<br />
The time-decay mechanism from the previous version is still there. So it's (weighted damage taken in last 10 sec) / (3615.3 * 10).<br />
<br />
Also I have to echo the opinions above about AM. If AM is nerfed too much it will get to a point where it doesn't matter if you use it or not. AM should feel meaningful to use.<br />
Fear not. We're not making anywhere close to that level of change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
New Character Models<br />
Why all the fuss or so little change. i can barely tell a difference. more would have been better.<br />
Wanted to clarify that having the new character models look like the old models was intentional. We wanted to increase fidelity while retaining the same look and feel of the old models. The new models have more polygons, double the texture resolution, updated animation, and support for facial expressions.<br />
<br />
While I agree the developers took the lazy way out, something is better than nothing at this point.<br />
<br />
Am I disappointed all we really got was a slightly updated model with 2004 customization options. Would I like to see more body styles, hair cuts, subrace skins, and more little customization options? Yes, but I've accepted the fact that Blizzard won't ever do it because that would require more than the bare minimum of effort.<br />
It's actually more of a challenge and require more iteration to make a higher resolution character model look like the old one as much as possible than it is to create something entirely new.

Patch 6.0 and Valor Upgrades<br />
i thought item upgrades were going away? and what will come of all our excess lesser charms?<br />
We're not carrying over the Item Upgrades system to new gear added in Warlords of Draenor. We are, however, continuing to support it for the gear it's already available on from Mists of Pandaria.

Mistweaver Consolidated Feedback<br />
--Uplift capping makes sense to make spell more consistent, but to that end, shouldn't reduce healing for full-HP targets.<br />
It doesn't. Full-health targets don't count toward the AoE capping.<br />
<br />
First off I'm not really sure what you're getting at when you say &quot;indirectness&quot; - could you please elaborate?<br />
Direct healing: I target someone, cast a spell, and the person I directly targeted gets healed.<br />
<br />
Indirect healing: I damage someone, and some person gets healed; I did not directly target them. OR I heal someone, and that person and some other person get healed.<br />
<br />
It's about whether you are directing where the healing is going or not.<br />
<br />
Does Celestalon not see that ReM is healing for 300 a tick, or 2k healing over 20 seconds? At level 90, that means I only heal 2-3% of a person's HP for 20 seconds with that one spell.<br />
<br />
It has to be broken, it is currently the weakest HOT in the game by a long shot. Can we get some sort of confirmation that ReM has scaling issues, or the numbers are placeholders, or something?<br />
Every time someone has posted something like that, it's been due to forgetting that it's a 3-target HoT, not a 1-target HoT. Do you have data to suggest otherwise?<br />
<br />
I still would like to see Soothing Mist not break with Renewing Mist and Expel Harm too.<br />
Those take up GCDs. Chi Brew does not. We're not looking to increase the % of your time that you spend Soothing, especially not by such a huge amount as that would do.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that only the first application is actually targeted. It's quite possible that the other two jumps could go almost completely to waste.<br />
This is another argument I see, that is possible, but unlikely.<br />
<br />
ReM will prefer injured targets over uninjured targets. That means that most of its healing will go to people that need it.

I don't understand how a completely spammable 70% speed boost + snare self-dispel is somehow balanced.<br />
because it has a cost (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/505773379366830080))<br />
The cost should be a cooldown though, the energy cost is hardly a cost.. Please understand this.<br />
It has a 1 second cooldown (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/505794226890612736))<br />

Does that mean there is literally nothing for being the first on the realm to kill end boss on mythic?<br />
No, Guild Realm First achievements for Mythic kills will remain as they have since Cata. I was addressing Challenge Modes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/505539467357458432))<br />

Beta Feedback - Proving Grounds<br />
In the most recent beta build, Heroic dungeons may now be accessed through the Dungeon Finder (LFG) system. However, as will be the case in the live game, you must complete the Silver Proving Grounds challenge for a given role if you wish to queue for a level 100 Heroic dungeon as that role.<br />
<br />
Next build there will be a regular garrison NPC that allows you to enter the Proving Grounds, but for testing, the Beta instance teleporter (Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade) should offer direct transport to the Proving Grounds. Tuning is not final, but please give the system a try, and post your feedback in this thread. (Then go queue for a Heroic dungeon and post your feedback in the appropriate dungeon thread!)<br />

yea and I am sure people will respond to you like they did in cata with &quot;great, is better the true and skilled tanks/healers play and make a difference from the nobs&quot; (as they said in cata)... and we all know how this ended.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Mildly grumpy&quot; just doesn't the character of the voice acting. It's what's always been off about female gnomes. The males look and sound happy while the females sound happy every time they speak in game, but look like they're fuming when they shut their mouths. <br />
Female gnomes have always reminded me of Kender. That &quot;Hi! How are ya?!&quot; always seemed to me to both be completely sincere but with a &quot;twitch the wrong way and you'll find a dagger in your groin before you know what hit ya buddy&quot; undertone to it. So for me just hint of a smirk, something half between what they have now and the old /sly animation, would be a good neutral for them in my completely subjective individual opinion.</div></div><hr />

I've been thinking of trying to pick it up. Since I do a lot of out in the world stuff I have to have a DPS spec and it just never seemed worth it to have to farm up a whole suit of tank gear to see if I like doing it. <br />
But in WoD I can do a tank set and it'll switch over to a DPS set when I change specs. If it's not just me, then there might be more tanks and healers in WoD as a result of that change in gear.</div></div><hr />

If you are scared of responsibility, yes. Unfortunately for you, DPS will get a lot of responsibility in WoD dungeons as well. Even normal dungeons need a fair amount of interrupts/purges in order to be successful right now. Let's hope that won't change too much.<br />

<br />
The direction of cutting down duration on defensive cd's are a little troublesome in my eyes though, think it makes better gameplay encounter wise if bosses hit harder for a little longer periods and defensive cd's are good to that rather than having burst windows with even higher damage which is the way to challenge smart defensive cd management with lower duration changes.<br />
<br />
And another concern is that right now on live, any good geared dps can do tank duty in heroic dungeons (fair enought mop tuning and ridiculus ilvl aside) but this new paradigm supports this behaviour and with high end expansion gear in warlords of draenor this aren´t unlikely to still be a thing sadly.</div></div><hr />

Yes! The draenei are a major focus with lots of cool characters. (_DonAdams)<br />
<br />
I guess getting quests from Draenei equates to lore and being a major focus with lots of cool characters. I quested through Shadowmoon and through Frostfire and the Horde is much more compelling lorewise and characterwise with seeing all the characters from their lore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't get these comments... Tanks were messing up enemy scaling because they had to hit so hard to even be dangerous, already needed a debuff for pvp, etc. So they are rebalancing them to be less defensive BUT also rebalancing enemies so that their damage is more tuned across the board and this may prevent the need for more artificial pvp debuff, which are annoying in the first place... This is a good change all around. Just stop bitching for a moment and think about implications...<br />
<br />
Also, just FYI the &quot;easier&quot; it is to tank, regardless, means more people will tank. That's how the WoW population leans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Currently, tanks feel like paper dolls in the open world on beta. If the current tuning is something blizz is comfortable with, leveling as tank and questing/exploring as tank is probably dead. <br />
<br />
Needing a healer to survive in raids is fine. Tanks on beta currently need a healer to survive mobs while questing.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what your complaint with cata tanking was. It seemed pretty fun to me. The dungeon styles definitely encouraged dungeon runners to learn some basic encounter tactics. They can bring that back as often as they want IMO.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what your complaint with cata tanking was. It seemed pretty fun to me. The dungeon styles definitely encouraged dungeon runners to learn some basic encounter tactics. They can bring that back as often as they want IMO.<br />
<br />
Tanking wasn't the problem. Healing was. Blizzard had switched from the niche system to a &quot;3-heal&quot; system, and also balanced a lot of stuff on the backs of healers. So not only did you have DPS that had been used to literally AoE-ing everything down in WotLK dungeons and heck with CC, but healers had real problems with mana at the lower gear levels. But hey - a lot of bored players who weren't the average PuG asked Blizzard to bring back the dungeon difficulty of TBC.<br />
<br />
Problem was that TBC never had anything like the LFD system. So in early Cata dungeons you were fine if your group was a premade of people you knew, but what about the non-premades? Now I'll remind you that non-premades drastically outnumber premades in LFD.<br />
<br />
So going back to what I mentioned in the first paragraph, can you imagine what it was like? I can certainly tell you that I don't need to imagine it -- I was there.</div></div><hr />

I had plenty of spare time so if the group was bad I'd just quit and requeue. Or if I made too many embarrassing mistakes I'd just quit, try and work out what I had done wrong, then requeue. When you finally did finish a dungeon it made the success seem all the better.<br />
<br />
That's why I like it when LFR is a bit challenging too. I was disappointed to read that Blizzard is apparently going to make LFR a lot easier than it is currently is in WoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Completely agree. Cata dungeons were not nearly as hard as TBC heroics, but the extra mechanics made it a lot more rewarding to master them. I think a lot of folks will PUG flex in WoD rather than LFR. Its aided by the new built in OQ features. Really doubt LFR gets the same level of traffic other than as a preview of the basic encounters. I'd do it once or twice to get some idea before a flex run, but if H 5-mans give the same gear, those are going to be a lot easier to fit into limited game time.<br />

As was I. Yeah healers got more pressure at first due to mana regen and LFD nubs who'd never played with CC didnt help. <br />
You arent looking at a mana regen issue in WoD, but nubs will still be nubs until they've wiped a bunch of times. Thats what playing the game is when its actually still a game. Faceroll wins get boring after a couple runs.</div></div><hr />

You want DPS to be able to take a few hits? That's what defensive cooldowns are for, like Evasion and Shield Wall. You want to lessen the gab in-between Tanks and DPS? Then just remove the tank role and make threat a more visual present all classes can control, enabling a far more open game design where each class takes responsibility instead of having most of the healing go to the same guy. With the tank role you have locked yourself to a &quot;This guy takes the damage&quot; in terms of design and it's generally hard to create a versatile game with.<br />
<br />
The point of playing a tank is to be this massive unkillable wall. That's the appeal of it, and you're effectively taking away that niche. The unkillable part isn't meant to be taken literal though, but tanks' responsibility is to mitigate a massive source of incoming damage that will wipe the raid if you fail to do it. You're saying &quot;That's a bad design&quot; and you're right, but you're also saying &quot;We've kept this design for so long we don't have the balls to actually go through with what we really want to change.&quot; So you go for something in-between that's neither tank or dps, guaranteed to make nobody happy with a post that's basically apologizing for this half-assed solution.<br />
<br />
The other day I was leveling my Rogue in Northrend and I got real tired of questing, so I tried to AoE farm. I had to make a FoK Subtlety build with Slow poison to kite the huge groups around with Burst of Speed to avoid dying. It was one of those moments where I really went &quot;Man I miss just jumping into huge groups of enemies on my tank and just taking them all on&quot; and now the philosophy is &quot;Tanks are just supposed to take a few more hits than DPS&quot;?<br />

Also props for them holding another big discussion on the game's development on the US forum where they continue to deny EU players the ability to post. This company is making progress.</div></div><hr />

If they felt something major was wrong with tanks they had almost 2 years to prepare and simulate.<br />
<br />
We will yet again enter live with a beta that was not used fix bugs and fine tune things, but used for game designers' ego boosting with the very classical &quot;let's do the opposite of what my predecessor did he was clueless&quot;, but the next 18 months of live will be live debugging for players.</div></div><hr />

I also makes it easier for other roles to survive in fight, that combined with boosted health and the new mechanic of us not being at full health all the time is me something that will take alot of pressure of tanks and may even allow tougher DPS's to viably off tank. all in all the extreme difference between tanks and dps will be minimised and It will bring tanks down on a level were they are not a role with OP defenses and slightly below DPS boosted by vengeance. How now people are like: Oh no tanks are getting a neaf. which is a stupid way of see things. the difference of roles are extreme ATM and this will reduce the gap between Tanks and DPS. That said. I don't want to see a mage or a healer priest, shaman or paladin to go and tank and replace the intended tanks. that's stupid and the changes wound go that far but I would be nice to see some tougher plate melees to off tank but no so their are taking over like I mentioned with healer or ranged dps's. Overall this is something I can't wait to try when the xpec comes out.</div></div><hr />
