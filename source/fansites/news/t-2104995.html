Patch 7.1 Hotfixes - November 3<br />
Dungeons<br />
Experience rewarded from queuing for &quot;Random Legion Dungeon&quot; (Normal difficulty) has been increased by 150%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maw of Souls<br />
On Mythic Keystone difficulty, the portal to Stormheim should no longer be covered up by the Challenger's Cache.<br />
<br />
Return to Karazhan<br />
Players who may have missed the final turn-in to Khadgar inside of the Return to Karazhan dungeon are now able to turn in “Fragments of the Past” and “In the Eye of the Beholder” to Khadgar outside of Karazhan.<br />
&quot;In the Eye of the Beholder&quot; and &quot;The Tower of Power&quot; should no longer fail to give players credit when defeating the final boss.<br />
(REQUIRES RESTARTS) When returning to a partially-cleared Karazhan, the bosses and associated minions that had previously been defeated by the party leader should now properly be absent, and other players with different boss lockouts should be able to join without issue.<br />
<br />
Items<br />
Players can now see and track their weekly and maximum cap of Lingering Soul Fragments in the Currency pane.<br />
Hidden Artifact appearances that drop off World Bosses should now be guaranteed on a kill.<br />
<br />
Pet Battles<br />
The Creeping Tentacle battle pet will now correctly drop on all difficulties of the Yogg-Saron encounter.<br />
&quot;Clone&quot;-type abilities on Blood Boil, Bloodgazer Hatchling, and the 2016 BlizzCon pets have been exchanged for other abilities.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Alchemy<br />
Recipe: Potion of Prolonged Power (Rank 1) no longer drops after you learn Rank 2.<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Players who activate the Ivory Talon buff for the Talon’s Vengeance faction are no longer Friendly to other players and NPCs while inside the Black Rook Arena.<br />
<br />
Class Adjustments<br />

Fortified Bark no longer grants critical strike reduction.<br />
Nourish now allows Healing Touch to apply Rejuvenation (Germination) if Germination is learned in addition to other heal-over-time spells.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
Quests<br />
Some unintentionally hidden World Quests in Suramar have been re-activated, including World Quests that are new to Patch 7.1.<br />
Lingering Soul Fragments for the quest &quot;Soul Prism of the Illidari&quot; should now be guaranteed to drop from Heroic dungeon end bosses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Karazhan Quests Hotfix<br />
Yesterday, a hotfix to the game corrected an issue where players weren’t receiving credit for killing Viz’aduum on the quests In the Eye of the Beholder and Tower of Power. This introduced a new issue where the quest “Tower of Power” now appears to be incomplete, even after you kill Viz’aduum. Try turning in the quest in your Class Hall after killing Viz’aduum for the week, even if it doesn’t look complete.<br />
<br />
We apologize for the confusion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incompetence and a mistake are completely different things. No need to get all melodramatic on us.. Blizzard are doing a GREAT job at the moment with the latest patch with little to few issues. Pointing out an individual fuckup doesn't mean the company as a whole is incompetent.</div></div><hr />

WHAT ABOUT THUNDERFURY SKIN FOR OUTLAW ROGUES FFS<br />

You can read, yeah? It's only for world bosses, as those are on a several month rotation and can be done ONCE in those several months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not your fault. &quot;Wrote&quot; is the correct form.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nnelson54</div><div class="date">2016-11-04, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Written&quot;. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to bad grammar.<br />
<br />
Well, this is embarrassing. Not only did you incorrectly correct a non-native English speaker, you managed to be an ass while doing it. &quot;Wrote&quot; was correct in this case.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wrote&quot; is correct for simple past tense(example: &quot;Blizzard wrote a forum post four or five days ago.&quot;) while &quot;written&quot; is correct for when the verb is passive or the subject is receiving the action(example: &quot;Blizzard has written a forum post about it recently.&quot;).<br />
<br />
The quick and easy rule is if the word is preceded by &quot;has&quot;, &quot;have&quot;, &quot;had, or &quot;having&quot; then &quot;written&quot; is the correct past tense usage. There are obviously exceptions because English is weird, but you will seldom go wrong doing that.</div></div><hr />
