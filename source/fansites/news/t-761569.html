This is now official, Worgens won't get their own mounts, they will get a mount racial spell instead.<br />
<br />
Running Wild (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/87840/running-wild/) - Drop to all fours to run as fast as a wild animal.<br />
<br />
Running Wild is indeed the new racial &quot;mount&quot; for worgen. Functionally the ability works exactly like a mount. This does mean the worgen are not bringing faction mounts to the table which other Alliance races can access. This is also of course very different from the original Plainsrunning implemented for taurens. We have no plans to try and bring that ability back in any form.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, we feel Running Wild fits very well with the nature of the worgen race. Rather than getting a physical mount, they get down and sprint on all fours. When you're playing a worgen, it just feels awesome. :) <br />

2nd part of Patch 4.0.1 on Background Downloader<br />
The 2nd part of Patch 4.0.1 is now available on the Background Downloader, things are looking a little better today for weird people who think that Cataclysm will be released on November 2. <br />

<br />
Others have said worse then I have, yet I seen no edits to their comments. Worgen need mounts, that's something many of us look forward to gaining rep then buying their mount to haul around and show it off. This way none of us will be able to do that.</div></div><hr />

Mind you they'll still be able to ride everyone elses mounts and the flying ones. Though really, Worgen don't fit on any mounts other then flying ones. Doesn't make sense with ground mounts. Would look terrible too.</div></div><hr />

How exactly is it different from plainsrunning?<br />
<br />
Plainsrunning required you to run for 10? seconds and then your speed would slowly ramp up towards mounted speed. It was a clunky mechanic and often kicked in at the most inopportune moments.<br />
<br />
Running Wild is different, it functions exactly like a mount: You cast the spell and you enter mounted status.</div></div><hr />

Plainsrunning wasn't an activated ability like a mount. It was a run 10 seconds then automatically you're sprinting around.</div></div><hr />

Running wild is a 1.5 sec cast, same as mounts.<br />

same speed as mounts.<br />
same abilities that comes with mounts.<br />

Plainsrunning was skill that triggered aftert 10 sec constant running.<br />

How, aside from actual implimentation, is this different than plainsrunning? Putting in simple terms, Tauren would run fast instead of mount. Now, worgen will run fast instead of mount. Sure the actual abilities had a different effect but the same result. Although it will finally bring an end to all those &quot;What will the worgen mount be?&quot; threads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the moment, mount count is 100% equal thanks to a previous patch adding new mounts to both Horde and Alliance. Giving worgen Running Wild instead of actual mounts is throwing off that balance. Class balance on the other hand, in Cataclysm, Horde will have ONE more class/race option than Alliance. That's nothing.</div></div><hr />

Who cares. Life ain't fair. And I'm Alliance saying this. Not that I think is in any way permanent, as I'm sure Blizzard will do something to cater to you whiners.

The obvious solution would be to have a neutral vendor somewhere sell the goblin mounts to the Alliance as well. Considering the race, that makes quite a bit of sense, and it solves any issues there might be without too much effort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids have racial mounts. So, no, they shouldn't. Running Wild is the Worgen racial &quot;mount&quot;.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Druids also have insta-shapeshift to travel form, which would be very overpowered in PVP if it was epic land speed. I vote no. Or else, you gain a cast time to your shapeshift. As a druid, I am not in favor of that idea.</div></div><hr />

As has been said a million times, the cataclysm happens for everyone regardless of whether or not you rent the expansion.<br />

Blizzard released a new version of the Background Downloader but it appears that not everyone got an &quot;auto-update&quot; or whatever. Happened to me and after checking the official forums I found a solution. Go to your WoW folder and delete &quot;BackgroundDownloader.exe&quot; and then run the repair tool, click on the &quot;Check Files Only&quot; button and let it &quot;fix&quot; any errors. It will download the new version of the Background Downloader which should then correctly download the new patch data.</div></div><hr />

This patch does the same that the Burning Crusade and Lich King pre-expansion patches did, adds the &quot;standard&quot; changes to the game for everyone, in this case it'll be the Azeroth zone changes, class changes (abilities, spells, talents, etc), the usual stuff that everyone gets regardless of whether you buy the expansion or not. The expansion itself will add the new zones and dungeons, flying in Azeroth, Goblin and Worgen races, increased level cap, etc.<br />
<br />
For those who don't buy Cataclysm, they won't be able to enter any of the new zones, no flying in Azeroth, can't create Goblin or Worgen characters, won't be able to increase their level beyond whatever version of the game they currently have etc. They WILL be able to continue adventuring in Azeroth, they'll have access to the zone changes and new quests, etc. Azeroth won't be &quot;blocked&quot; if you don't buy the expansion, you'll just not be able to access the content that the expansion adds.</div></div><hr />

How about we get rocket trikes too and in exchange Goblins can run on all fours? (I don't mean that literally I am just frustrated by these changes). Why, pray tell, are Worgen not getting their own mounts? Will Worgen be able to ride other race's mounts (horses, Rams, etc.)? Would it not be semi fair that in exchange for not getting a mount, Worgen are allowed to buy other race's mounts without being exalted, or only having to reach revered/honored instead?

<br />
1) You have a firewall blocking certain traffic that the downloader relies on (it's a type of torrent from what I understand, I'm not a computer network guy so those smarter than me can confirm/deny). But there are certain ports that you need to go to your router's hardware firewall settings and set to allow.<br />
<br />
2) Make sure you have peer to peer transfer on. Yes, you're right, Blizzard's own servers are limited, when you're talking about millions of users updating. But with P2P, snippets go along much faster. Don't get me wrong, it'll still take a long time, and some minutes you'll be fast, some slow. But overall, it should drop the total time down quite significantly. It still is a 4gb patch, so it'll take a few hours no matter how you look at it.</div></div><hr />

Well morons, If the mount achievement is doable at this point then it still is in cataclysm. You all are just wanting shit handed to you rather then working for it, sure the horde gets a bit more mounts but heck who cares aslong as you can still get it.<br />
<br />
As for lazy, How in heavens sake can you call this lazy, Blizzard will have to make a proper four legged running animation that does not make cloth, leather, mail and plate wearers looks incredibly stupid while doing so, That is ALOT harder then simply putting a worgen on a mount.<br />
<br />
This is one of the most fun ideas of blizzard till so far. Just immagine yourself running next to a bunch of mounted guys while your running on your feet, IMO it would look sweet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well morons, If the mount achievement is doable at this point then it still is in cataclysm. You all are just wanting shit handed to you rather then working for it, sure the horde gets a bit more mounts but heck who cares aslong as you can still get it.<br />
<br />
As for lazy, How in heavens sake can you call this lazy, Blizzard will have to make a proper four legged running animation that does not make cloth, leather, mail and plate wearers looks incredibly stupid while doing so, That is ALOT harder then simply putting a worgen on a mount.<br />
<br />
This is one of the most fun ideas of blizzard till so far. Just immagine yourself running next to a bunch of mounted guys while your running on your feet, IMO it would look sweet.<br />
It's pretty damn hard to get 150 mounts if you don't do hardcore arena or raiding. Us casual thumb-sucking noobs might want to get the achievement too, and racial mounts have always been a fantastic boost to our collections. Also, many of us, even non-mount collectors, still want a boar mount.<br />
<br />
I'm not against Running Wild, I'm just against mount unbalance (as Blizzard spent time balancing them out in the first place), and I'll miss the opportunity for the boar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Plainsrunning required you to run for 10? seconds and then your speed would slowly ramp up towards mounted speed. It was a clunky mechanic and often kicked in at the most inopportune moments.<br />
<br />
Running Wild is different, it functions exactly like a mount: You cast the spell and you enter mounted status.<br />
<br />
Seems like Running Wild is just an improved version of Plains Running. they learned what didnt work and was &quot;clunky&quot; with tauren naturally running mountless, tweaked it and gave it to worgen as a perk for the expansion. I'm disappointed to hear they don't intend to bring back plains running for tauren, but on the other hand they like to keep things &quot;balanced&quot; especially between factions, and soon after the cataclysm hype dies down and they've sold enough copies, I think one of the new things they'll give us is a mountless run (seems most likely for tauren) similar to the improved version now called Running Wild. Though Zarhym has posted blizzard's current plans, things change dramatically especially when they're under pressure.<br />
<br />
I don't think Zarhym is making the final big decisions, more likely he's just reporting what he knows at the time.<br />
<br />
&quot;squeaky wheel get the grease&quot; and if people post that they want something like running wild for horde, enough QQing on the WoW forums would get it. We'll always get something new and cosmetic, if enough people say they want it it would be an easy decision for the the developers<br />
<br />
then again running wild may be a flop and people hate it... so alliance are the guinea pigs, haha :P</div></div><hr />

That pig aint the worgen's mount, its his freaking diner plate. That and we connect worgen's to the idea of werewolfs, and we all know they like to run around and do it quite fast actually.have a nice day<br />

(3rd post in 3 min... yeah, I know)<br />
<br />
Don't worry. I don't think they're trying to make things imbalanced, they just want to keep adding enough cool things for the expansion to attract people and sell copies of cataclysm...like in wotlk, how strong DK's were for months... once they sell enough they'll spread the love evenly between races and factions.<br />
<br />
just ride the hype bandwagon and enjoy the OP that cataclysm brings for the first 6 months or so</div></div><hr />

THANK YOU BLIZZARD! FINALLY SOMETHING I WANT!<br />
<br />
I'm an Alliance mount collector myself, and I couldn't be happier we get something so unique instead of a mount. Blizzard will probably implement something else to balance eventually, and even if they don't I'm not too worried. Now we just have to hope they don't screw up the animations and actually make it look cool, although that will probably be tough if you're a class that wears a skirt regularly.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes. Really. You do know there are achievements for getting a certain number of mounts, right? Race mounts are some of the easiest to get. This means horde have easy access to more mounts.<br />
<br />
I don't care about the mounts. I don't care about the achievements. But I can at least understand why people are upset about it. It IS a real imbalance. Try putting yourself in someone elses shoes for once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To all of those who are getting atrocious speeds from the official downloader, here's a tip:<br />
<br />
Go to the World of Warcraft folder and then into the &quot;cache&quot; folder, and open a file named BackgroundDownload.torrent in whatever Torrent program you prefer. You may have to start the official downloader for the .Torrent file to appear in the cache folder. <br />
<br />
Sit back, and enjoy putting your broadband to some actual use. I'm getting speeds of approximately 1 MB/s, but your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
After the download is done, simply copy the file (named &quot;WoW-3.3.0.10958-4.0.0.12911-EU-Stage-2&quot;) into your &quot;X:\World of Warcraft\Updates&quot; folder. Then, start the downloader again (either by opening and closing WoW, or just run BackgroundDownloader.exe from the WoW folder). If everything has gone according to plan, the progress bar should blaze from 0% to 100% in a few seconds while the updater checks the files for integrity.<br />
<br />
The keen reader will notice that this refers to the European file. I can't guarantee that it'll work for other continents, but I am seeing American peers in my list.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I'm quite sure Blizzard can easily fix this by giving the Alliance back the mounts taken away back in Vanilla when they made the swift mounts.... seriously, I want the White Stallion/Palamino/Nightsaber/Ancient Frostsaber/Black Ram/Frost Ram and the mechanostrider thingies to make a comeback.

<br />
&quot;They better do something to make this up to mount collectors!&quot; - Why!? Go collect your fucking mounts. Go save your money and buy a spectral tiger, and all the other ebay mounts...I'm sure you don't have those, so until you do, it's not like your collection is complete other than the worgen mounts. And there ARE none, so you have nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
And what in the BLOODY HELL is with all this &quot;Horde has more mounts&quot; talk now. Who cares if Alliance had more in Lich and they balanced it, it's only because 90% of the player base are babies who cry at the drop of a hat. So the Horde have some tricycles, who cares? I've already tossed out the argument for collectors above, and anyone else just needs ONE fucking mount to get them from point A to point B.<br />
<br />
Even if they put a damned pig in the game, or whatever, only a handful of the people bitching about it would even go for it. It's just something to complain about to those people who do nothing but play the game, and bitch about it when they aren't.</div></div><hr />

Sooooo they give you an entirely new model mount and stick us with a tiger that hasn't had a haircut in a few years?<br />
<br />
I'm still skeptical that it's a mount. There were banner areas on the alliance guild mount, this thing's such a lowrider there's no possible way it could display a banner. And if it IS the horde guild mount, Blizzard's gonna get one heck of a full inbox of complaints...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty certain that Blizzard knows there will be a lot of QQ'g about faction mount imbalance over this, obviously they know this means no Worgen mounts for other Alliance races to purchase, so I'd guess Blizzard will have something in the pipeline in regards to this. This is just the standard PR approach, make a small announcement to generate interest/feedback/reactions, then release further details at a later date.</div></div><hr />

ICC has been out for MONTHS, if you havent done it now do you expect us all to wait for you to do it? No one cares about how messed up ICC will be once 4.0.1 comes out, besides itll be out a few weeks before Cataclysm is launched, making ICC irrelevant anyways. Why the eff would they balance lvl 80 around Cat features? They never did with other expansions either, other than making it easier. And btw, theres a 30% buff to ICC, go enjoy it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;They better do something to make this up to mount collectors!&quot; - Why!? Go collect your fucking mounts. Go save your money and buy a spectral tiger, and all the other ebay mounts...I'm sure you don't have those, so until you do, it's not like your collection is complete other than the worgen mounts. And there ARE none, so you have nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
And what in the BLOODY HELL is with all this &quot;Horde has more mounts&quot; talk now. Who cares if Alliance had more in Lich and they balanced it, it's only because 90% of the player base are babies who cry at the drop of a hat. So the Horde have some tricycles, who cares? I've already tossed out the argument for collectors above, and anyone else just needs ONE fucking mount to get them from point A to point B.<br />
<br />
Even if they put a damned pig in the game, or whatever, only a handful of the people bitching about it would even go for it. It's just something to complain about to those people who do nothing but play the game, and bitch about it when they aren't.<br />

OT: I have to admit I like the idea of Worgen not having a racial mount. I haven't seen them on a mount, but I imagine it would look just as, if not more goofy than a mounted Tauren (and Draenei).</div></div><hr />

I for one do. Those deserted cities are nice. I often hang out in Darnassus when I want to browse auction house, chat with friends etc. The fact that there is nobody there is kinda calming. Same goes for Silvermoon at Horde side. I hated Shattrah with all those yelling Draenei NPC. Dalaran is better but it is still a bit crowded/loud at peak times.</div></div><hr />

After all, many diseases that are capable of afflicting pigs can afflict humans. So the story behind it could be that the pigs got the &quot;curse&quot;, too, so they transformed into these giant tamable horsebearpigs. (Someone call Al Gore)<br />
<br />
I'm on the side of the fence that's QQ'ing about having fewer attainable mounts. And to those of you who think it's more difficult to make a worgen appear to be galloping on all fours as opposed to creating a new pig mount, you're mistaken. They already have this animation implemented from the worgen that already exist in the game, and giving it the mount-like actions and speed is hardly a challenge. I honestly think this will create more difficulty in the future than it'd be to design a new mount. After all, it would probably have all the movement animations like a current in-game boar.<br />
<br />
This will be fun to use, sure, but I'd be substantially more excited about a new mount.</div></div><hr />

As for me I love the idea of running wild. Now normally I'm horde, and the Worgen looked really tempting to me, that on fours thing increased that. (Originally, I was hoping dark flight would be animated to be on fours, but this works too.)I also collect mounts, and I'm not troubled by it, I ended up getting faction mounts last anyways...because there so generic and EVERYONE had them. Aside from drake mounts, I'm not a big fan of constant color re-skins. *cheers to hoping the Raven lord stays unique*<br />

Sucks for mount collectors I guess, but I think Worgen getting something cool is more important than a couple of extra mounts for some archivements/mount collection. Maybe Blizzard could add some extra mounts elsewhere for alliance side if it's needed to balance it out, or give Worgen some different textured horses (or cats, considering their connection to night elves) for racial mount in addition to this.

OK. Yes, it does appear there will be imbalanced mount numbers between the factions. But maybe if you just thought clearly for 1 fucking second... Have Blizz implicately stated that they will NOT be compensating the Alliance for this? I am 100% sure they will give us new skins for our current faction mounts, or implement new mounts in some way. There WILL be balance. Although imo, they shouldn't really care more the whining retarded masses, they do. So wait untill Blizz elaborate on the situation before crying like fucking babies. <br />
<br />
Horde. Quit bitching about your plainsrunning. Again, Blizz have gone back on their word before, and I could see them implementing it again... At the cost of the removal of the Kodo racial mounts. There would be your balance...<br />
<br />
OT, I really love the idea of Running Wild. It is a very original idea, and definately suits the Worgen more then any other mount designed could. And to the baltant idiots who think that this is a lazy cop out move for Blizzard. I would imagine it is going to take at least as much work then designing a new mount, (or reskinning a mob, which is what most mounts are) if not moreso. A bit of a mount collector myself, instead of bitching and crying about it, I'll simply wait paitently for Blue text about the mount imbalance. Like any mature human being would.</div></div><hr />

It's also very unfair for all other Alliance races. This way, they will have a much harder time with doing the new mount achievements then the Horde.<br />
<br />
If Worgen do not get mounts which other Alliance players can buy, then I think that each other Alliance race should have one regular and one epic mount added to their vendors. Only this way will the difference be compensated, and can the Alliance actually still obtain the achievements.<br />
What I just said may not make much sense to anybody who doesn't have the mount achievements yet. However, I do have the 100 mounts achievement on my Shaman (Lihonessa, Alonsus EU), and trust me when I say that 8-10 mounts make a huge difference for the achievements. Without Worgen mounts or additional mounts for the Alliance races, they will have to collect an additional 8-10 non-Alliance or rare mounts to compensate for the difference, plus they'd have to obtain even more these mounts to reach the new achievement... See where I'm going when I said that it would be impossible?</div></div><hr />

Sad.<br />

Imagine how much better WoW would be if everyone who has an account younger than 3 years would get banned FOREVER.<br />

My god, GS would be extinct, achievtards would stay down, and people would actually feel a bond between others in the same faction. (It was unthinkable back then to stand in the middle of booty bay surrounded by allies/hordes of your own and getting ganked without your faction giving a shit.

Have you people looked at yourself lately? Stop collecting mounts and play the damn game.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you've realised, but people actually do play the game for fun. There are people who like collecting mounts, and getting the achievements for it.<br />
How about thinking about that for a second, before you start to run your ignorant mouth and offend all the mount collectors of WoW?</div></div><hr />

I think you need to queue for a dungeon or try get someone to raid some old-world content, such as c'thun etc.<br />

Oh aswell as tards skipping bosses in dungeons , explaining &quot;its faster&quot; while the time spent killing such boss is time spent properly, instead of sitting in the Queue like an idiot (but hey, limited views).<br />

Good luck with it.<br />

You think these days there are elitists? they are a joke, a sad excuse - not elitists. Most of them are just handfed emblems by their circlejerking guilds, and i bet you they wouldn't even know who the hell Archimonde was.<br />

Is this what everyone wants WoW to become? a piece of shit MMO based around numbers with completely no living, breathing world which made WoW what it is in the first place? GTFO.</div></div><hr />

A short while? I've been playing since Vanilla, before AQ was actually released.<br />
And do a dungeon or an old-world raid? No problem, we have those here every day! Hell, I see multiple raid groups doing old world content on my server daily, and most are even succesful as well!<br />
<br />
You think I've been playing for a short while? I think you need to look at yourself for a change. Also, my point about the mount achievements still stands. Even if you do not like achievements, or if you do not like collecting mounts, just use your brain for even a second if you're able to.<br />
It's unfair that the Horde gets such a mayor advantage with the mount achievements, it's like forcing all mount collectors to re-roll Horde just so they can complete them.</div></div><hr />

I don't care if you're paying a monthly fee, you're paying it to get the content Blizzard puts out, and whatever the fuck they do, no matter how much you whine, you'll still all pay it.<br />
<br />
&quot;They better do something to make this up to mount collectors!&quot; - Why!? Go collect your fucking mounts. Go save your money and buy a spectral tiger, and all the other ebay mounts...I'm sure you don't have those, so until you do, it's not like your collection is complete other than the worgen mounts. And there ARE none, so you have nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
And what in the BLOODY HELL is with all this &quot;Horde has more mounts&quot; talk now. Who cares if Alliance had more in Lich and they balanced it, it's only because 90% of the player base are babies who cry at the drop of a hat. So the Horde have some tricycles, who cares? I've already tossed out the argument for collectors above, and anyone else just needs ONE fucking mount to get them from point A to point B.<br />
<br />
Even if they put a damned pig in the game, or whatever, only a handful of the people bitching about it would even go for it. It's just something to complain about to those people who do nothing but play the game, and bitch about it when they aren't.<br />
<br />
My thoughts exactly, blizzard has a great idea and people cry over not being able to get an achievement done as easy as someone else, It's like little kids whining that their classmate gets more allowance than they do.<br />
People talking about &quot;Mount Collectors&quot; a collector collects what he can get, not what he thinks he should get, this is just crying over an achievement and using Faction Balance as an excuse.<br />
It kind of reminds me when TBC was announced and hordes freaked out over that alliance would get shamans and that they didn't want/need paladins, now you'll find more paladins than shamans on that same side.<br />
Just let time fix this, since I assume blizzard will someday give up and add some pointless mounts to make people stop complaining about nothing.<br />
It's good that blizzard usually ignores it's &quot;Fanbase&quot; because if they didn't I doubt they'd ever get anything released, anything they come up with is immediately burned down by people that are unable to look further ahead.</div></div><hr />

TL/DR :)<br />
there were more posts like this, but I chose you for convenience<br />
<br />
it just doesn't make sense that they first add mounts for Horde to make sure both sides have an exactly equal amount of them so that all have the same chances of getting to 100 mounts and there's no disadvantage and blah blah<br />
then next they add mounts for the Horde only.<br />
that´s not QQ, that´s just plain ill logic.<br />
<br />
that being said, I as a mount collector am looking forward to playing my Worgen on all fours</div></div><hr />

<br />
See, I'm glad that there are some people who actually make some solid statements about this issue. Thank you.<br />
However, there are a few things which I'd like to counter with:<br />
<br />
Now, indeed, collectors should collect what they can get. However, the achievement brings more then just a special reward; it brings a feeling of accomplishness, like you actually managed to complete your collection. The Alliance will likely not be able to accomplish this, or at least very few people do. Now, I wouldn't mind that per sé, but only if the Horde had the same issue. Yes, I am talking about balance.<br />
But see, I do like the fact that Worgens get this ability. They are already a very special race, and allowing them to get on all fours to run faster is just awesome. This fact however makes mount collecting unbalanced between the Horde and the Alliance. I already mentioned a good solution in my previous post; simpily add more mounts to the other Alliance races.<br />
One thing I can see however is that you claim that we are complaining about nothing. Well, you may see it as nothing, but for people who collect mounts and want to feel a sense of accomplishness once they get the achievement, this is a big issue. If Blizzard decided to make a game in which players could pick sides, then the least they could do is make them balanced, instead of favoring one side over the other, no matter what the topic may be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deceit</div><div class="date">2010-09-19, 12:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My point was, from my original post, that complaining about mount achievements is a waste of everyone's time. I can appreciate that many people enjoy doing things that some of us may not enjoy, like collecting mounts. I for one think achievements are a completely worthless idea, that has only steered WoW in the wrong direction. This equal opportunity problem with mounts wouldn't have occurred had it not been for the mount collecting achievements and I think that goes to show how achievements force WoW Devs into a tiny box that they must end up working in. Instead of revealing fresh ideas, they simply can't because fiends must continue hunting down their ridiculous achievements.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, I've never understood achievements. I feel no sense of accomplishment from gaining an achievement, even when my guild and I finally downed 25man HM LK, it wasn't the achievement that was exciting, it was the experience. I hope that can help these &quot;achievement people&quot; understand that it's meaningless to gain these achievements, you won't remember them an expansion from now, you'll remember the time you spent with people you enjoy playing with and the experiences you had.</div></div><hr />

Actually, the Goblins do have a faction, named the Bildgewater Cartel. As for their mounts, there will be more variations of them on release.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nuadormrac</div><div class="date">2010-09-19, 12:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the moment, mount count is 100% equal thanks to a previous patch adding new mounts to both Horde and Alliance. Giving worgen Running Wild instead of actual mounts is throwing off that balance. Class balance on the other hand, in Cataclysm, Horde will have ONE more class/race option than Alliance. That's nothing.<br />
<br />
Yeah, because there's achievements for total number of mounts on one's char, but there is no achievement for number of available classes. Really a balance here would effect the relative ease or difficulty a given faction has in obtaining that achievement, with whatever rewards one gets (aka the albino drake at 50 mounts, alliance side).<br />
<br />
To put it simply, there's a certain number of mounts one can get (the normals for all faction races one's exalted with which have such mounts, which is all up through Wraith), which can be had at the cheap 60% land mount gold price. The epics can be had at the still rather cheapish these days 100% land mount price. It's a quick way to get up to the 25 mount achievement without busting the bank on expensive mounts (saving gold) and without depending on drops which can have a lowish drop rate (aka the ZG mounts hadn't dropped for me in &gt; 4 years trying).<br />
<br />
By the horde having a few extra racial mounts for goblins, this means they'll have an easier time working up towards the 50 mount achievement and beyond, without having to rely on drops, and without having to buy the more expensive mounts (such as getting all the netherwing mounts, etc). That's where the balance would come in, just how expensive/easy it would be for the given factions to get the mounts. Course if bliz required the horde to have more mounts at each achievement point (aka, similar to how the number quests needed for horde/ali vary in getting loremaster, based on the number quests available to them in the given continents and zones), this could give adjustment. Or they could add more mounts. But at present, it does mean someone going after the mounts achievements would have to bust out and buy the more expensive mounts on ali, before they would on horde...<br />
<br />
Course whether the issue of balance or parity will get much weight (wrt how cheaply one can come by the same achievement) will get much consideration, I'm not certain. In TBC the alliance had a much easier time hitting exalted with all their faction races, when doing all the Draenie starting quests along with their own races, then the horde had (because ghostlands doesn't rep Silvermoon, and Azuremyst isle gives a fair amount of associated rep to other alliance factions also). The issue became kind of mote though, for 80s, once the Argent Tournament started providing faction rep.<br />
<br />
BTW, I've got chars, and also actively play on both factions.... ;)</div></div><hr />

It's also very unfair for all other Alliance races. This way, they will have a much harder time with doing the new mount achievements then the Horde.<br />
<br />
If Worgen do not get mounts which other Alliance players can buy, then I think that each other Alliance race should have one regular and one epic mount added to their vendors. Only this way will the difference be compensated, and can the Alliance actually still obtain the achievements.<br />
What I just said may not make much sense to anybody who doesn't have the mount achievements yet. However, I do have the 100 mounts achievement on my Shaman (Lihonessa, Alonsus EU), and trust me when I say that 8-10 mounts make a huge difference for the achievements. Without Worgen mounts or additional mounts for the Alliance races, they will have to collect an additional 8-10 non-Alliance or rare mounts to compensate for the difference, plus they'd have to obtain even more these mounts to reach the new achievement... See where I'm going when I said that it would be impossible?<br />
<br />
I don't think impossible would be the right word, but more costly/difficult yes.<br />
<br />
I hit over 50 mounts on one char without ever so much as buying a 3 man mount, or hitting up all the drop mounts. But the idea is to buy the cheapest mounts first, which is all the faction mounts (cheapest being normal, then epic 2nd cheapest), then moving on to buying all the flying mounts.<br />
<br />
But after this, it's onto more expensive mounts, aka the Talbuk mounts from Nagrand, but from there one starts to hit the expensive ones. Not in game, but the netherdrakes are as I remember 850 gold a piece. There comes a point where one then needs to move onto the ice and grand ice mammoth, and from there eventually to collecting all 3 man mounts as a last resort. Given they're greater then 10,000 gold a pop, the question is, who has to hit the big purchase sooner.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly certain that with going from 100 to 150 mounts, the expansion probably will hold additional mounts, somewhere, so will be doable. The real question is if the ali will have to break the bank more to get there.... I'm assuming that 85 dailies (assuming we will have those) probably won't pay much better then 80 dailies do now, if history holds with 80 dailies giving 13 g 40 s now, vs the 10 g one got when doing Sunwell dailies in TBC when 70 was teh cap.</div></div><hr />

Tried that and it gives me another BackgroundDownloader but still won't download anything, fucking retarded. But thanks anyway.<br />
<br />
Managed to get it to work, probably because I installed IE8 now it's downloading, but stage 2 and I don't even have the first part ah well.</div></div><hr />

Or does it really count as a mount, where you will get this racial with lvl20 but cannot use it unless you purchase the riding skill first?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">metallicrowe</div><div class="date">2010-09-19, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the backround downloader has a speed limit because well, it's a BACKROUND downloader, not supposed to be fast... I guess. Since mine is going equally slow. lol<br />
This makes me grr. ;D<br />
<br />
for some reason, my background downloader is not doing anything at all, not even opening. when i go to manually open the downloader it says there is no file to download, yet everytime i open the wow launcher it says that a new patch is ready for download. does anyone know how to fix this?</div></div><hr />

but could someone who is in beta tell me how big in gigabytes exactly is their DATA folder in the beta installation?<br />
My current live wow DATA is 16,6 gb.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naoto</div><div class="date">2010-09-19, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not bad, had this downloading for hours and so far recieved 352MB, says it will take another 55 hours to download the rest, which is bullshit considering I'm on a 50 mbit connection and I usualy download 4gb in under 20 minutes, I know it's a background downloader and I'd see the point if it was downloading WHILE I played WOW, but I have it on when I ain't even on it so what's with the 56k bullshit speeds? during WOW it should be slow, if you download it AFTER you exit then you surely should get better speeds, 55 hours to download 4gb? lol what the hell......</div></div><hr />

Goblins bring a mount, so the horde faction now has a +1 mount advantage? o_O</div></div><hr />
