Dragonwrath, Teracgosa's Rest Preview<br />
Now that we can finally take a look at the game files the questline for the Legendary staff is starting to look much clearer, especially after Blizzard's preview! It's time to take another look at the now finished questline for the legendary staff, and a couple of other things. <br />

<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
A couple of achievements are tied to Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. <br />
Feats of Strength<br />
<br />
Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5839/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/#13914/14002) Owner of Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guild - Dungeon &amp; Raids<br />
<br />
Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest - Guild Edition (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5840/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest-guild-edition/#13914/14002) Owner of Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. Reward - Dragonwrath Whelpling (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71033/dragonwrath-whelpling/)<br />
Obviously, it was also added to We Are Legendary (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4861/we-are-legendary/#13914/14002), A Legendary Collection (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5009/a-legendary-collection/#13914/14002), and The Ultimate Collection (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5010/the-ultimate-collection/#13914/14002). <br />
<br />
<br />
Early datamining seems to indicate that the Dragonwrath Whelpling (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71033/dragonwrath-whelpling/) rewarded to the guild will be the &quot;Tarecgosa Whelp&quot; model but there is no confirmation yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/tarecgosawhelp_small2.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/tarecgosawhelp.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
Dragonwrath, Teracgosa's Rest - Questline<br />
After going through things and stuff and poking at even more stuff, I eventually got the entire questline for Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. <br />
<br />
According to that screenshot released by Blizzard (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/dragonwrath1.jpg) I wouldn't be surprised if some of the very important of the questlines were played as in-game cutscenes.<br />
<br />
A Legendary Engagement (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29129/a-legendary-engagement/) / A Legendary Engagement (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29132/a-legendary-engagement/)<br />
Objective - Speak to Anachronos in the Caverns of Time.<br />
Description - I expected that I would find you here, &lt;class&gt;. But then, we of the bronze flight have somewhat of an advantage when it comes to such things.<br />
<br />
*Coridormi smiles.*<br />
<br />
For reasons unknown to me, my master seeks audience with you. I would counsel you not to take this invitation lightly, &lt;name&gt;. Anachronos seldom has cause to interact with mortals. Wisdom would dictate that you seek him out in the Caverns of Time at once. <br />
<br />
Speak to me when you are ready and I shall personally deliver you.<br />
<br />
A Wrinkle in Time (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29134/a-wrinkle-in-time/)<br />
Objective - Speak to Anachronos in the Caverns of Time to witness the future of Azeroth.<br />
Description - Listen carefully, &lt;class&gt;, for though we are only beginning, time already grows short and the consequences of our failure are unfathomable. An event in the recent past has been obscured from my vision by the most powerful of magics. Its impact, however, has not. <br />
<br />
If action is not taken to change the course of this timeline's future, the outcome is clear. Brace yourself, mortal, and behold the future of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
All-Seeing Eye (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29135/all-seeing-eye/)<br />
Objective - Collect 25 Living Embers (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69237/living-ember/) from Firelands and 3 Sands of Time (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/65893/sands-of-time/).<br />
Description - I perceive the questions that burn within your mind and I must confess that I share in your uncertainty... a rare position for one such as I, and a most unsettling one. As I scour time to find traces of this obscured event, you must aid me in the creation of an Eye, both to test your worthiness, and to provide an essential tool in the unraveling of this mystery. <br />
<br />
Venture into the Plane of Fire, &lt;class&gt;, and gather Living Embers. Bring them to me with Sands of Time and I will create the Eye.<br />
<br />
On a Wing and a Prayer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29193/on-a-wing-and-a-prayer/)<br />
Objective - Bring the Timeless Eye to Coldarra.<br />
Description - Time well spent, mortal. <br />
<br />
While you were struggling in the Plane of Fire, my watchers and I were able to determine where and, most importantly, when our vision was obscured. We have discovered that the shroud was placed over the Nexus, far to the north in the realm of the blue dragonflight. <br />
<br />
I have attuned the Timeless Eye (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69238/timeless-eye/) to show you the occurrences that remain hidden to us here. Go at once to Coldarra and search out a place suitable for the Eye's activation. <br />
<br />
Travel well, friend.<br />
<br />
<br />
Through a Glass, Darkly (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29194/through-a-glass-darkly/)<br />
Objective - Use the Eye of Eternity at the Nether Vortex in the Nexus. Meet Tarecgosa inside the Nexus where she will escort you to the rift.<br />
Description - Tarecgosa listens as you explain your presence in Coldarra.<br />
<br />
Your tale rings true, &lt;class&gt;. Much has changed since the death of Malygos - little of it for the better. I know of the device you carry, and I recognize Anachronos' magic in its creation. There is but one place in all of Coldarra that would allow this Timeless Eye to be used discreetly. <br />
<br />
You will need my assistance if you hope to succeed. Speak with me again inside the Nexus and you shall have it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actionable Intelligence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29225/actionable-intelligence/)<br />
Objective - Speak to Kalecgos at Nordrassil in Mount Hyjal.<br />
Description - &lt;Tarecgosa listens intently as you describe your vision.&gt; <br />
<br />
Impossible! Not even Arygos would dare to go to such lengths. I do not question your integrity, &lt;class&gt;, but you must understand - your mortal mind can easily be deceived. <br />
<br />
Regardless, Kalecgos must be informed of these events. You must travel to Nordrassil at once to seek him out. I shall remain here to conceal the evidence of our activities. Speak of this to no one else!<br />
<br />
<br />
Delegation (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29234/delegation/)<br />
Objective - Recover the Branch of Nordrassil (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69646/branch-of-nordrassil/) from the Firelands.<br />
Description - I am duty-bound to look into your claims immediately, &lt;race&gt;, which means my mission here now must fall to you. A surge of ancient magic, far too strong to have occurred naturally, drew me here. I have since discovered a most troubling development. <br />
<br />
A bough from Nordrassil has been ripped from the tree and taken deep into the Firelands. There, a powerful ritual threatens to corrupt Nordrassil, consuming it in flame. You must find a way to interrupt the ritual and reclaim the world tree's branch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nordrassil's Bough (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29239/nordrassils-bough/)<br />
Objective - Speak to Kalecgos to offer him the Branch of Nordrassil (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69646/branch-of-nordrassil/).<br />
Description - Much has transpired since last we spoke. I have taken it upon myself to visit the Nexus and recover Anachronos's artifact, but not before using it for myself. Now I too have witnessed that which you have seen. <br />
<br />
Before discussing the matter further, allow me to express my gratitude to you for your assistance, both here and in the Plane of Fire. Give me the Branch of Nordrassil, &lt;name&gt;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Emergency Extraction (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29240/emergency-extraction/)<br />
Objective - Accompany Kalecgos to Coldarra. Speak to him when you are ready.<br />
Description - Now, back to the matter at hand... I am convinced that the vision in the Nexus is one of Deathwing's illusions designed to bring conflict into our flight at a very fragile time. The Worldbreaker would only be strengthened were we to fall to infighting. <br />
<br />
Still, a gnawing sense of unease tempts me to take a path of caution. It would be wise for me to take Tarecgosa and withdraw until the time of choosing.<br />
<br />
<br />
At One (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29269/at-one/)<br />
Objective - Speak to Kalecgos to agree to his proposition.<br />
Description - I was charged with her protection, yet it was she who sacrificed herself for my sake. I cannot bear to lose her, &lt;name&gt;. I must make a solemn request of you. <br />
<br />
Never has a mortal borne the essence of a true dragon, but with your permission I would make an exception. Please, while there is life in her, will you allow me to bind Tarecgosa to you? <br />
<br />
<br />
Time Grows Short (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29270/time-grows-short/)<br />
Objective - Collect 25 Seething Cinders (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69815/seething-cinder/) from the Firelands.<br />
Description - Tarecgosa is bound to you, &lt;name&gt;, but only temporarily. An aspect's power is required to permanently seal her essence. Malygos's successor will not be chosen until Azeroth's moons next eclipse, and the bond you share will not last until then. <br />
<br />
Fortunately, there is a way to buy us the time we need. Powerful elements exist that can extend the ritual's effects. Some of these can be found in the Plane of Fire, with which you've become familiar. Obtain them, &lt;class&gt;, and sustain Tarecgosa until the eclipse.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alignment (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29285/alignment/)<br />
Objective - Accompany Kalecgos to the blue dragon council. Speak to Kalecgos in Coldarra when ready.<br />
Description - The time of choosing has arrived, &lt;name&gt;. While only members of the Blue Dragonflight may attend, Tarecgosa's binding makes your presence requisite. <br />
<br />
I must ask that you take on her form and vote on her behalf. Do not tarry. The moment of the eclipse draws near....<br />
<br />
<br />
Heart of Flame (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29307/heart-of-flame/)<br />
Objective - Obtain the Heart of Flame (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69848/heart-of-flame/).<br />
Description - You are the first mortal to witness a dragon council, &lt;name&gt;, and among the only beings in Azeroth to take part in the choosing of an Aspect. My ascension has endowed me with incredible power. I have taken the liberty to strengthen Tarecgosa's bond with you, though she will require a more... permanent home. <br />
<br />
I would have you venture one last time into the Plane of Fire and bring me the heart of Ragnaros. When next we meet, I will be able to suitably thank you for all that you have done.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Stuff of Legends (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29312/the-stuff-of-legends/) (Temporary name?)<br />
Objective - Speak to Hallegosa / Witnessed Kalecgos Ceremony in Stormwind<br />
Description - It is an honor to make your acquaintance, &lt;race&gt; Your deeds echo in the ears of Azeroth's creatures, mortal and immortal alike. <br />
<br />
I shall present the heart of Ragnaros to Kalecgos when he arrives. Its power is to be harnessed to further endow your weapon. The ceremony is to begin shortly. I have been appointed to escort you there when you are ready.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dragonwrath, Teracgosa's Rest - Transcripts<br />
Last but not least, the sound files for the questlines are available and we have transcripts! Thanks to Radux, Sunshine, Buckwald, Magekid, Elysia, Syronius, Bahumut5, Treeston, and Zao for the help on those!<br />
<br />
Anachronos<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ANACHRONOS_VISION_01 - Listen well, mortal.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ANACHRONOS_VISION_02 - Countless threads are woven to create the fabric of our timeline.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ANACHRONOS_VISION_03 - As the Wardens of Time, we of the Bronze Dragonflight observe their infinite combinations.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ANACHRONOS_VISION_04 - When disruptions are detected by our watchers, we are charged with their repair.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ANACHRONOS_VISION_05 - A recent event obscured by powerful magics remains masked, even to me.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ANACHRONOS_VISION_06 - But the catastrophic outcome is plain.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ANACHRONOS_VISION_07 - Azaroth will burn!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ANACHRONOS_VISION_08 - While the details remain shrouded from our view, one thing we have gleaned<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ANACHRONOS_VISION_09 - is that the fate of Azeroth hinges on the deeds of a mortal.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ANACHRONOS_VISION_10 - Are you the mortal on which so much depends?<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ANACHRONOS_VISION_11 - Only time will tell.<br />
<br />
Arygos<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_ECLIPSE_01 - We gather to determine the fate of our troubled flight.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_ECLIPSE_02 - Our history has been wraught (sp?) with great challenge.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_ECLIPSE_03 - Our future promises even greater threats.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_ECLIPSE_04 - These circumstances demand a powerful leader.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_ECLIPSE_05 - I was raised at the feet of my father.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_ECLIPSE_06 - I watched as he steered us through adversity - never flinching from difficult decisions.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_ECLIPSE_07 - Some called my father mad, but even in his darkest hours his vision was clear.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_ECLIPSE_08 - He put the needs of this flight first and foremost.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_ECLIPSE_09 - He sought to consolidate our rightful power, fortifying us for the cataclysm that he saw coming!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_ECLIPSE_10 - Brothers, we must take what is ours. Under my leadership, this flight will rise again. Beyond the glory of our past, onwards to an even greater destiny. I will see to it!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_ECLIPSE_11 - Fools! Neltharion take you all!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_EYE_01 - I have agreed to this meeting, Worldbreaker - but at great risk. If this is discovered...<br />
VO_QUEST_42_ARYGOS_EYE_02 - And once this... new order is established, my place will be secure, yes?<br />
<br />
Deathwing<br />
VO_QUEST_42_LEGENDARY_DEATHWING_01 - Call yourself Arygos, your barrier will buy you all the time you need.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_LEGENDARY_DEATHWING_02 - With Kalecgos death, your destiny, as the blue aspect, shall be realized.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_LEGENDARY_DEATHWING_03 - Your reign, over the realm of magic will be absolute. Even after the hour of Twilight.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_LEGENDARY_DEATHWING_04 - But be warned, Arygos, son of Malygos. Do not make the mistakes of your father!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_LEGENDARY_DEATHWING_05 - Cross me, and your punishment will be greater than the madness he suffered!<br />
<br />
Kalecgos<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_AMBUSH_01 - Tarecgosa!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_AMBUSH_02 - What is the meaning of this?<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_AMBUSH_03 - Noooooooooooooooo!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_AMBUSH_04 - Ugh, Deathwing's vermin.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_AMBUSH_05 - (Grunting)<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_AMBUSH_07 - Ohh.. Tarecgosa..<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_01 - Brothers, sisters, Arygos speaks of our troubled past.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_02 - Indeed, we have suffered greatly.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_03 - But, I would contend that we are, at least, partly to blame for the scars we bear.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_04 - Let us turn from our old ways.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_05 - Let us not seek to extinguish magic from the world.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_06 - But to use it responsibly for the benefit of Azeroth and all its inhabitants.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_07 - It is true that our choice here today will affect the destiny of our flight, and, likely, the destiny of the world.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_ECLIPSE_08 - May the titans guide us. May we be inspired to choose with wisdom.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_FINAL_01 - Welcome, we've been expecting you.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_FINAL_02 - You are to be congratulated for the success in the Firelands.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_FINAL_03 - But praise alone will not suffice.<br />

VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_FINAL_05 - Present me your staff that we may endow it with great power.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_FINAL_06 - Finally, Tarecgosa, our beloved sister who's essence you have generously borne, has chosen this staff as her permanent home.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_FINAL_07 - May her presence be a source of comfort and companionship to you.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_FINAL_08 - We thank you, friend of the blue dragonflight.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_FINAL_09 - We owe you a great deal for the part you have played in the destiny of our flight.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_GOSSIP_01 - You seem troubled.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_GOSSIP_02 - What brings you to me, mortal?<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_GOSSIP_03 - Speak freely, friend.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_KALECGOS_GOSSIP_04 - Something about you seems.. familiar.<br />
<br />
Tarecgosa<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_AMBUSH_02 - You shall not have him!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_INTRO_00 - What? What foolishness is this?<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_INTRO_01 - You there! Have your senses abandoned you?<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_INTRO_02 - Coldarra is no place for mortals now.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_INTRO_03 - You must leave at once, if you value your life.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_A_01 - The rift can be reached through this hall. Follow me.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_A_02 - Stay close. If we are caught, it will be the end of both of us.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_A_03 - Security here is much stronger than I recall. What is Arygos protecting?<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_A_04 - A sentry approaches. Hide yourself, quickly!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_A_05 - The threat has passed. Come now, we must hurry!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_A_06 - More sentries approach. There's no other way!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_A_07 - I'll handle this one. See if you can find any others.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_A_08 - Follow me, mortal. The rift is near.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_A_09 - At last, we have arrived!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_B_01 - Fight harder, mortal! We mustn't fail!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_B_02 - Let none escape! Our efforts here cannot be discovered!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_B_03 - Defeat them quickly, before more arrive!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_B_04 - Augh, we cannot afford this delay!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_C_01 - Assist me! There are too many!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_C_02 - Watch out! More sentires!<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_C_03 - Arygos's drakes are attacking! Let none escape.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_C_04 - Defend yourself, friend! Our attackers are formidable.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_C_05 - Quickly, onto my back! We must escape this place.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_D_01 - Protect me, while I break the barrier.<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_D_02 - What?! Twilight dragons? Here?<br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_D_03 - Quickly! Make your way across the chasm. <br />
VO_QUEST_42_TARECGOSA_NEXUS_D_04 - Careful, avoid his breath at all costs.<br />

The staff has 4 different models for 4 different 'phases'? Do you actually get the staff in those pre-phases or do you only get to wield it as a lengendary, when it is complete? Has anyone picked up on that yet?</div></div><hr />

Legendaries are guild effort. Your guild should be able to pitch in to help you gather all of the materials as much as possible.<br />
<br />
This is even more true for this particular legendary, as it also gives a reward to the entire guild(besides more damage) and not just the wielder itself.</div></div><hr />

Restricted to specific classes and probably one or at most two people inside an operational raid community. Yeah... definitely something for the masses. <br />
<br />
This sort of quests should be the norm at top level - long, epic, demanding quest lines with some potentially useful rewards, but most of all, a good storyline. I'm waiting for the Thrall questline details.</div></div><hr />

Getting the branch doesnt even slightly look like the quests from shadowmourne. The 25 cinders and Embers parts are similar. You never needed to kill the lk to complete shadowmourne.<br />
<br />
<br />
I bet the droprate of the shards will be fairly low, probably ~25%. Shadowmourne required the 25 primordials AND 50 shards, with a 50% - 99% in heroic, 25% - 50% in normal drop rate.<br />
Ulduar required 30 shards and was a ~10% drop rate, but didn't require much else. So 25% seems like a fair estimate IMO.<br />
<br />
Both ulduar and icc had more bosses than firelands. That may be a reason why you only need 25 shards compared to earlier legendaries.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind that bosses are less too than Uld-ICC still 25% seems pretty logical to me... <br />

I am a healer and i really really really hope that the staff will not be viable for healers.

<br />
That dragon is Tarecgosa, she will die trying to save Kalecgos from a sneak attack and the only way to preserve her spirit is to seal it inside of you temporarily. Until the end of the quest-line where Kalecgos will use his powers and the heart of Ragnaros to bind her spirit to the staff to, in essence, keep her alive, so no not even close to lame :p<br />

Tarecgosa gets killed and Kalecgos imbues you with her spirit but it's only temporary until you can build the weapon. Then she enters the weapon so that she can still live forever in a sense.<br />

<br />
This sort of quests should be the norm at top level - long, epic, demanding quest lines with some potentially useful rewards, but most of all, a good storyline. I'm waiting for the Thrall questline details.<br />
<br />
This questline is looking rather similar to Shadowmourne's questline in that you'll likely get some usable epic versions before the final legendary, and likely before you have to go into heroic mode so that is for the &quot;masses&quot; per-se. I'm sure collecting 25 Living Flames will be considerably harder and much more time consuming than primordial saronite, but I'm sure by the time the next raid tier is out some casual guilds may have gotten the epic staff.</div></div><hr />

The 25 cinders and Embers parts are similar. You never needed to kill the lk to complete shadowmourne.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Both ulduar and icc had more bosses than firelands. That may be a reason why you only need 25 shards compared to earlier legendaries.<br />
<br />
Hehehe the weapon was created to kill Lich King... no sense in needing to kill him 1st like this new legendary.<br />
<br />
It actually has nothing in common with SM, except for using &quot;primordial saronites&quot; + &quot;shards&quot;, the story/purpose of it looks totally diferent. You'll use it to fight the forces in fireland, but it's not meant for it. It's a &quot;house&quot; for a victim of Deathwing in the middle of Ragnaros incursion and the Blue Dragon Flight betrayal/council. It does indeed start with a vision of world burning and all, but the Staff is something created in the middle of all this mess to &quot;save&quot; Tarecgosa.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has confirmed multiple times that it is for caster DPS only.<br />

It would also make absolutely no sense at all to have an agi based version, seeing as how the entire questline is wrapped up in dealing with the blue dragonflight, who are the guardians of MAGIC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And there will be an expansion or content patch, in the near future, where the Blue Dragonflight will be a faction, and your Teracgosa-wielding character will start at 'Hated' with them. Or, maybe 'Neutral' - just like everyone else.<br />
<br />

If it wasn't made for 1 role, then the use of it would be too good or too bad. And in the end it would be just another epic. Nothing legendary about something that is there for everyone.

<br />
A lot of it, yes. If fact, pretty much every step that says &quot;Go get X&quot; will need to be done in the Firelands raid. For sure the Heart of Flame and the 25 Seething Cinders, for the last and next-to-last steps respectively, will require a raid. It is highly probable the the Branch of Nordrasil will require a raid group as well. The 25 Living Embers needed early in the chain could potentially be bought, either through valor points or ridiculous amounts of gold. I don't really expect these to be available through VP though right away, and each Ember will probably sell for at least 10k+ for a while.<br />
<br />
There has never been a legendary item in game that was possible to get without needing an at least somewhat progressed raid group to obtain at the time when it was introduced.</div></div><hr />

Not really, from what I understand and read somewhere unless I read it wrong... in order to get those quests, you have to have had cleared all three raids- BOT/TOTFW/BWD before you can access the quest so no, I would say this is harder than the SM quest-line because anyone who were able to wield it were able to get it no problems.

Shadowmourne never required you to kill the Lich King. Tarecgosa's Rest requires you to kill Ragnaros.<br />

There doesn't appear to be any lame infusion quests.<br />

Ok fair enough, but unlike shadowmourne there are no gimmicky boss mechanics you have to do, no stupid 1000 mobs killed, and you actually have to kill the final boss in the raid. Collecting items from bosses is the only thing that is the same.</div></div><hr />

so, basically its going to be SP/HIT/CRIT if that is the case...HIT+ Haste or Mastery will make it viable for a healer up until the final version (with proc)</div></div><hr />

First, I've gotta help get out guild in and kill the final bosses in the current tier of raid. I know I'll be getting the staff and I know my guild is going to be there to help be along the way, 100%. GG Blizz, I love the story and your hard work. Let's see the stats and proc for the weapon. It would be insane if it had, in addition to the dmg proc, a &quot;use&quot; mechanic that turned you into Teracgosa for x amount of time. Just for fun! In any event, I'm pleased with what they've done.<br />
<br />
To all the people QQing about how it's the same as Shadowmourne, stfu. I can't even begin to imagine how you react to everything else in REAL LIFE if this is how you're acting about a quest in WoW. Be thankful... if you're so unhappy, cancel your account and throw yourself your computer off a balcony! The complaining gets so old and I don't think people realize just how silly you look. I'd like to see how good you are at pleasing EVERYONE.</div></div><hr />

The way I see it, it makes sense that you don't get a goodies box this time because Arthas/Lich King had a ton of lore and characterization behind him. The dragons didn't really have any, if ever, lore pre-WoW.</div></div><hr />

This award system is to better compliment the spirit of Battlegrounds. One account-bound mount will be awarded for each achievement unlocked, allowing players who obtain 150 and 300 Rated Battleground wins to earn this mount a second and third time. The additional mounts earned can then be sent to alt characters, given they’re account-bound. These mounts are awarded as soon as an associated achievement is unlocked and do not correspond with end-of-season rewards.<br />

Also the seething cinders part seems to now be 1000 instead of 25, at least according to the quest text.

Be forewarned that I have seven 85s and a toon of every class so what I am about to say could not be any less biased.<br />
I will agree with you on the fact that there has not yet been a legendary dagger to benefit 2 specs in the game as of yet. But seriously...<br />
TF was beast for rogues back in the day if they were lucky enough to get one(which many were, as rogues could apply the debuff faster than tanks, ppl neglected this fact based on the assumption that the maintank would be the most reliable for attendance and be at every raid so as not to waste this weapons debuff, which at the end of the day may or may not have been true). Rogues were also potentially the best wielder of the war glaives, and combat was the shit back when they came out, so quit qq'ing about daggers, maybe when daggers have the potential to be used by more than 1 class(2 specs)effectively in any facet of the game you might get your legendary dagger. Everyone has had a crack at the legendary pool if you have been playing since vanilla(2 usable by rogues ). Tanks have never had any legendary item specifically restricted to them such as a shield that with a chance when hit would reduce all incoming damage by 40% or so, for instance. I don't even have a tank anymore and I think this would be badass to give to them. The truth is if you don't like what this game is offering your class, how about instead of whining about it on mmochampion forums you either quit the game or reroll a class that you feel is being treated more fairly. Or maybe you wait it out and assas/subt rogues are the next to rejoice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkSoul</div><div class="date">2011-06-28, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cry more. Legendaries are one of the few places in game where the developers don't have to, or specifically don't want to, worry about whether something is balanced for pvp. You don't get it through pvp, you get it from raiding. To hell with pvp balance. They didn't nerf Shadowmourne in pvp, they didn't nerf Valanyr in pvp, even in classic someone with Sulfuras in a bg was someone you get the fuck away from.<br />
<br />
I'll wholeheartedly support the banning of anything in the game in pvp the day Blizzard implements pvp- and pve-specific effects for every single spell in the game, so that when something needs changed for pve content it's not because a bunch of whiny bitches cried that it's op in bg's. Unless and until they do that, I have no sympathy whatsoever for someone crying about something only gained through high end pve content being unbalanced in pvp. You learn to deal with it, or you give up. It's that simple.</div></div><hr />
