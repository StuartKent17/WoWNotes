PvP Rewards in Patch 7.1<br />
With Patch 7.1: Return to Karazhan arriving on October 25, we wanted to share some updates on PvP rewards from Battlegrounds, Skirmishes, Arenas, and Rated Battlegrounds. Like many of the players we’ve heard from over the last few weeks, we’ve identified areas where PvP rewards could be more satisfying. Along the way, we made a few changes through hotfixes, but we can do much more in a full content patch.<br />
<br />
Artifact Power<br />
Soon after players began exploring the Broken Isles, we recognized the incredible impact that Artifact Power has as a reward mechanism. While PvP already rewards Artifact Power, it isn't clear how much Artifact Power you might get from doing a particular PvP activity, which might have made some players reluctant to participate. To address that, Artifact Power rewards have been increased for PvP in Patch 7.1, and the user interface will now show you exactly how much you'll receive for a victory.<br />
<br />
First Victory of the Day Bonus<br />
The Honor reward for your first Random Battleground victory of the day has always been twice that of subsequent victories. In Patch 7.1, we've extended that bonus to all of the other brackets in PvP: Skirmishes, 2v2 Arenas, 3v3 Arenas, and Rated Battlegrounds. Furthermore, in addition to bonus Honor, your first victory of the day will also reward a large Artifact Power bonus. This means big rewards for players who participate in a variety of PvP formats each day.<br />
<br />
Here are examples of Honor and Artifact Power rewards for each bracket, including first-of-the-day bonus rewards:<br />
<br />
&lt;table style=&quot;margin: 0 auto;width: 90%;border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;<br />

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activity&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honor&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artifact Power&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artifact Power (at Artifact Knowledge 10)&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;Skirmish Win (First of the Day)<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;160<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;950<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;Skirmish Win<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;80<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;25<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;238<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;Random BG Win (First of the Day)<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;300<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;400<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3800<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;Random BG Win<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;150<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;200<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1900<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;2v2 Win (First of the Day)<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;200<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;120<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1150<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;2v2 Win<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;40<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;380<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;3v3 Win (First of the Day)<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;200<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;180<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1700<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;3v3 Wins<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;100<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;60<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;570<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;Rated BG Win (First of the Day)<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;600<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;800<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7600<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;Rated BG Win<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;300<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;400<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3800<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;<br />
&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
Gear from PvP<br />
While the impact of gear in Battlegrounds and Arenas in Legion is different from past expansions, we still believe it’s important for endgame activities to reward items. In Patch 7.1, every Battleground or Rated Battleground victory will reward a piece of gear. Losses will also have a chance to reward gear based on the final score of the match, and Skirmish and Arena victories will have an increased chance to drop gear. This gear will has a chance to roll up with the possible bonuses you’re used to, including Warforged, Titanforged, socketed, and with tertiary stats.<br />
<br />
Our initial approach for Legion has been to have the item level of gear rewards from PvP increase with your Honor Level. However, the way this works hasn’t been obvious to players, and it resulted in the unfortunate circumstance where some players tried out PvP only after gearing up elsewhere—and were disappointed by the PvP rewards. In Patch 7.1, we've transitioned PvP gear rewards to more closely mirror the type of item level progression you see from World Quests. This means PvP should feel as rewarding as other parts of the game that offer high replay value.<br />
<br />
Weekly Bonus Gear from Rated PvP<br />
Previously, your first victory in each rated bracket of PvP (2v2, 3v3, Rated Battlegrounds) rewarded a piece of gear based on your current PvP rating. This wasn’t ideal. Often, players didn’t know what item level reward gear would offer before participating. Winning a single game represents a fairly insignificant amount of effort for a piece of high item level gear, especially considering this gear has the potential to rival the best items from raids or Mythic Keystone dungeons. The decision to use your current PvP rating also discouraged players from doing anything that might result in their rating going down. For example, if you've just had an amazing run in Arenas, you may decide to stop trying to improve your rating, or you might be reluctant to put your rating on the line with a less-skilled friend who just logged in.<br />
<br />
In Patch 7.1, each bracket of rated PvP (2v2, 3v3, Rated Battlegrounds) has a weekly quest that rewards items based on your best rating from the previous week. The quests for Arena brackets will require 10 wins, and the quests for the Rated Battleground bracket require four wins. Below a rating of 2000, these quests will always reward a piece of gear with the current season's Gladiator appearance. Above 2000 rating, these quests will always reward a piece of gear with the current season's Elite appearance. Again, you’ll always see the item level of the gear you’ll receive in the tooltip of the weekly quest.<br />
<br />
Here is an example listing of the rating-to-item level breakdown for Season 1:<br />
<br />
&lt;table style=&quot;margin: 0 auto;width: 90%;border-collapse: collapse;&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;tbody&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last Week's Rating&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Base Item Level&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appearance&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;0 - 1399<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;840<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Gladiator<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;1400 - 1599<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;850<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Gladiator<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;1600 - 1799<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;860<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Gladiator<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;1800 - 1999<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;865<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Gladiator<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;2000 - 2199<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;870<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Elite<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;2200 - 2399<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;875<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Elite<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;2400+<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;880<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Elite<br />
<br />
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;<br />
&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
We hope you'll find all of this information useful as we head into Patch 7.1: Return to Karazhan. We want PvP to be a compelling activity for all World of Warcraft players, and we want to make sure it rewards those who commit extra time and effort to the competitive side of the game.<br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Bonus Roll Gold<br />
We're aware that it's not a great feeling to receive a small amount of gold when a bonus roll doesn't give loot. However, this system was added back in Mists of Pandaria and it was only designed to give either an item from the boss loot table, or gold as a consolation prize.<br />
<br />
We're looking into adding other sorts of consolation prizes, such as Artifact Power, in the future. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/777392-world-of-scalecraft/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613723522?page=1#2))<br />

You were just late to the party (possibly also playing on a smaller server?). It was a major problem the first few weeks which makes this fix so late, it's not even funny. At least they fixed it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly this. At least you get gold, its something. If you loot a boss (on kill) and get gold it feels slightly better than if the body lights up and you loot it and get nothing. The same could be said for bonus rolls, you roll the dice and hope for something good, but if you don't get loot getting some amount of gold is better than getting nothing at all. Switching it up, including artifact power in the consolation prize list could be nice, but you know that people will complain about that too. &quot;Oh I bonus rolled this thing for AP.. uselss&quot; Even though AP really isn't useless, someone would there will complain about it being used as a loot consolation prize.</div></div><hr />

Eh, more gold would be nice since the price increase for coins to bonus roll. Since your option is 1k, 2k, and 4k or Resources (which soon will be the best way to go). But a step up to 3 digit gold value hurts no one and makes the risk reward slightly more balanced. Agreed, it is a gamble, but the cost to play is pretty high. I've been playing long enough to not be concerned, but I don't see the reason for hating on a larger gold increase. 10% of the value to play doesn't seem awful compared to 2% or less. I do wish they would add another way of achieving them back into the game instead of just a raw resource buy. But I usually prefer some sort of do this to get this than just buy it option. More ways is nice and doesn't really hurt anyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Screwing over the playerbase by making all pre-Legion pvp gear barred on an item that has an abysmally<br />
low drop rate in pvp rewards is not good. Either remove the Mark of Honor as a currency<br />
and convert the gear to gold, or give a RELIABLE source of honor badge farming.<br />
<br />
Cause doing it by the grace of RNG is bullshit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm glad they finally did something. Yes the game is still less than 2 months old... but the beta was introduced a long time ago and people addressed the concern THEN and were ignored.<br />

Sadly the satisfaction of being right isn't all that satisfying.</div></div><hr />

PVP gear is the new Ashran - hard to understand, broken, and eventually, people will grind it, and then once they get their reward, never touch it again. And they'll go through several iterations with Holinka fumbling around as usual, making claims that it's fine. <br />

Color me shocked, that he did it again.</div></div><hr />

Oh boy gold, a measly what, ~30 Gold for 15 minutes of your time. I can make 100 times that killing trash for Sacks of Gems and vendoring greys in the same time limit. I wish that you could just trade World Boss loot, that way if someone gets an item that has bad stats or is a lower iLvl than they have they can give it to their party/raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not something though. The gold rewarded is generally ~3-4% of the price of the token if using gold to buy them (assuming baseline token price, much lower if escalated price) and would take around 30 failed rolls to even return the value of one token. If it were closer to ~30-40% (300-400 gold) then it might not feel so insulating as you could regain the value for one token the following week in cases where all three fail in a given week. <br />
<br />
In some ways, I would prefer if it rewarded loot or nothing, because the 35ish gold doesn't feel like a &quot;consolation prize&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Can't quite decide if you're trolling. If not, why do you need to be fed in every corner of the game? Where's the reward in that? You get out what you put in. Brats like you ruin the game by whining, for a long time now it's been to easy to get what you want.</div></div><hr />

Dishing out 1K gold or more to get 30 gold back is kinda lame. I don't say that the bonus roll should guarantee loot, but I rather would get something else in return than gold if I spend gold. AP would be a fine solution, if the token would be in the same area as the quest reward for this week's world boss (about 5K before research bonus). <br />
<br />
In MoP, we have been trading quest rewards to bonus rolls, there it was OK to get extra gold. But spending a 4-digit-sum of gold to get 2 digts back is nonsense.</div></div><hr />

But seriously this. People expect BiS gear from every boss/dungeon/raid/quest. Then when they get nothing or something less due to RNG they cry on forums as if there were OWED it.</div></div><hr />

5k BEFORE artifact knowledge!? That would be a seriously insane amount! Currently close to 50k AP for 1 reroll... Way too high!<br />
