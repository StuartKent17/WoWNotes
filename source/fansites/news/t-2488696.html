The odds are stacked against you in Queen Azshara’s home territory—but with the right equipment, you can turn the tides in your favor.<br />
<br />
In Rise of Azshara, we’re introducing a new type of equipment called Benthic gear, which you’ll earn and collect while adventuring in the naga domain of Nazjatar.<br />
<br />
As you explore Nazjatar, you’ll collect Prismatic Manapearls—soulbound currency you can spend to purchase Benthic tokens and upgrades. These bind-to-account tokens can be used to gain a piece of upgradable Benthic gear specific to your armor type (cloth, leather, mail, plate), starting at item level 385. With enough time and effort, players can dedicate their hard-earned Manapearls to upgrade pieces to ilvl 425, just shy of Heroic-level raid gear (ilvl 430).<br />
<br />

<br />
Speak with Voidbender Zorlan in Newhome (Horde) or Voidbinder Sturzah in Mezzamere (Alliance) to upgrade your Benthic gear.<br />
<br />
Besides purchasing Benthic tokens with Manapearls, you’ll also sometimes find them in treasure chests and on enemies throughout the zone.<br />
<br />
Each piece of Benthic gear boasts a thematic bonus that applies in Nazjatar and the upcoming Azshara’s Eternal Palace raid. These bonuses might provide effects that boost your damage, slow down your foes, or even increase your mount speed while adventuring through this perilous region. Customize your character with up to six unique bonuses. Put together pieces to create a powerful set for combat, collect a set optimized for exploration, or mix and match to have the best from both worlds. Additionally, each piece has predetermined secondary stats which allow you to have more control over your character’s build.<br />
<br />
Benthic gear is currently available for early testing on the Rise of Azshara Public Test Realm, so make sure you jump in to check it out!<br />

Forbes Interview - Why Rise Of Azshara Is The Fix-It Patch For 'World Of Warcraft<br />
Forbes recently interviewed (https://www.forbes.com/sites/hnewman/2019/05/30/why-rise-of-azshara-is-the-fix-it-patch-for-world-of-warcraft-ion-hazzikostas-explains/#6f1d48e06d0a) Ion Hazzikostas again on the upcoming Patch 8.2.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth and Essences<br />
<br />
Rise of Azshara is the fruits of a lot of Blizzard's reflection on feedback they've been hearing from the community since Battle for Azeroth first came out.<br />
You will unlock the first major socket for your Heart of Azeroth just by being 120 and doing the Nazjatar introduction followed by the Magni quest chain to unlock it. There is no neck level requirement for the first major slot.<br />
Smaller sockets on the neck will give boosts to stamina as you progress your neck between neck level 52 to 67 so that health pools stay in line with the damage and healing increases.<br />
Heart of Azeroth Levels 55 and 65 are the unlocks for the two minor slots.<br />
The Essence system functions much like the glyph system in that once you learn as essence, you are free to switch them in and out in either a rested area or by using a Tome of the Clear Mind.<br />
The tuning of essences is on par with the Legion legendaries.<br />
<br />
Nazjatar and Mechagon<br />
<br />
There are cosmetic perks that come with leveling up your bodyguard in Nazjatar.<br />
Is seems as if Nazjatar will not have any Jeremy Feasel &quot;mad science&quot; WoW Secret Finding Discord secrets.<br />
The team is aiming for more variety in Nazjatar world quests. There are still some kill quests, however.<br />
There is no emissary for Mechagon.<br />
There will be no time-gating in Nazjatar, but some reputation requirements to pieces of the major story for pacing and passage of time.<br />
Using reputation thresholds to advance the story feels better than rigid weekly chapters that you have to just wait until next week to unlock. There's something the player can do to speed it up.<br />
The Mechagon dungeon and Eternal Palace raid will not be available on day 1 of the patch, but when season 3 starts a couple of weeks into the patch.<br />
<br />
Season 3 Affix - Beguiling<br />
<br />
Beguiling is the new affix for Mythic + Season 3. It represents the minions of Queen Azshara invading the dungeons of Kul Tiras and Zandalar. There are three types of handmaidens that will be present in a variety of pulls in different configurations from week to week.<br />
These handmaidens can have shadow, arcane, or frost powers. They have different effects that will change the way you approach certain pulls. Certain pulls that you skip might have to be done this time around.<br />
<br />
Flying<br />
<br />
The Rustbolt Resistance reputation will be available on day 1.<br />
They made sure to make Pathfinder Part II tied to outdoor content. There are no requirements to do any dungeons or raids.<br />
They believe the amount of time it takes to unlock flying this time around will be on par with Legion.<br />
<br />
Benthic Gear<br />
<br />
Benthic gear will help fill gaps in gear acquisition.<br />
The baseline Benthic tokens are BoA so you can use them to catch up your alts.<br />
<br />
Rare Spawns<br /> 
<br />
The rare spawns in Mechagon that have longer timers involve hours, not days.<br />
Silver-bordered mobs these days have evolved into named targets, not rares. These new ones are more true rares in the style of Timeless Isle.<br />
They have been looking at coordinating these spawns across servers ans shards so that there isn't any shard hopping.<br />
These rares can have cosmetics, pieces of gear, and punch cards for the Mechagon trinket.<br />
<br />
Operation: Mechagon Dungeon<br />
<br />
The bosses in the dungeon are meant to feel more like a small raid encounter.<br />
There are some hidden challenges in the dungeon for the more mythic-raiding types who want a bigger challenge, much like the Nightbane run from Legion Karazhan.<br />
Mechagon dungeon loot is on part with the normal mode raid, and then scaled up a little bit beyond that.<br />
Some of the most powerful punch cards for the Mechagon trinket are found in the dungeon.<br />
There is an essence you can unlock from the dungeon.<br />
<br />
Class Changes and Revamps<br />
<br />
Full class overhauls are something that happens in a new expansion update and not a patch.<br />
Legion was an exception because it reinvented so many specs from the ground up.<br />
Rotational changes, removing/adding abilities, etc are a jarring experience. This is the sort of change that is best received within the broader sweeping changes of a new expansion.<br />
They will always address under performing talents or classes in patches.<br />
There are definitely specs on the radar for a rework, but nothing to announce now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW Classic Feedback - Bug Hit Table Thread<br />
[Bug] Hit tables<br />
As I suggested in my first reply, we did a deep dive on this one to compare combat table values directly between our Reference client and WoW Classic. Apologies for the data dump, but because your observations were so detailed, we wanted to be equally detailed in our reply!<br />
We created Troll Warriors in both games and watched the combat table values for auto-attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
We checked three player levels – Levels 15, 40, and 60.<br />
At each level, our weapon skill was maxed, and we used the same weapon for all tests.<br />
All attacks were against enemy creatures, not other players, to remove any additional variables.<br />
We tested attacking creatures at -5, +0, +1, +2, +3, +5, and +15 levels relative to our level (so for the level 15 test, we attacked level 10, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, and 35 mobs).<br />
<br />
For our level 60 test, there were no normal mobs available at higher levels. We instead attacked elite raid creatures at +1, +2, and +3 levels.<br />
<br />
The exact same creature IDs were tested against on both clients.<br />
<br />
<br />
In all cases, the Reference client combat table values matched the Classic combat table values:<br />
<br />
Creatures that are 3 levels above the player have a 14% Parry chance in our Reference client. This holds true for our Classic client as well.<br />
Creatures at your level have a 5% chance to Dodge your attacks. Each additional level the target has over the player grants them 0.5% additional chance to dodge. This is observed in Reference client and in Classic.<br />
Players have an 8% chance to miss a creature that is 3 levels above them in our Reference client. This holds true for our Classic client as well.<br />
Critical Strike chance is reduced by 1% per each additional level the target has over the player. (So if you have a 4% chance to crit an at-level target, you have a 1% chance to crit a +3-level target, in both clients.)<br />
<br />
<br />
A briefer look at having non-maxed weapon skills also showed identical values between the Reference client and Classic. We also ran several tests while dual wielding, and the results from those tests was also identical between Reference and Classic.<br />
<br />
Based on these results, we are confident that the combat behavior in Classic properly reflects the combat behavior of 1.12 WoW. However, we’re always grateful for players looking out for discrepancies, so keep your feedback coming!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Stress Test Feedback<br />
Stress Test Complete -- THANK YOU!<br />
We have now completed the WoW Classic Stress Test that began yesterday at 2:00 p.m. PDT. We’re very pleased with the amount of participation we saw, and we’re happy to report that we got a great deal of highly useful data, as well as new issues that were uncovered by your efforts to log in and play.<br />
<br />
The closed beta realms remain available for those testers.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much to everyone who participated in this stress test!</div></div><hr />

This board is fill with crybabies that complain about changing up classes every expansion, when in reality it really is like every other. There was even a new thread started on this exact topic recently.<br />

Weren't you banned not too long ago ? <br />
<br />
OT : Preach was kind of right, they are making the current game more casual friendly and accessible while waiting on the classic feedback.<br />
Moreover I don't know if it's just me or the classic team is passionate about the game, I know it's crazy maybe I'm wrong.<br />
<br />
The game, outside of raiding and top end PvP has always been casual, raiding since WotLK and PvP has been super accessible to everyone. WoW was intended to be the casual MMO from day one and was super casual friendly compared to others out at the same time and before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Were&quot; being the operating word here, don't you think?<br />
<br />
And any lack or surplus of passion projected onto the teams from players is just that. Projection. It's easy to come across as &quot;listening to players&quot; when remaking a game that was already known though, aka no new stuff to be added, as few changes as possible. The current team has to be passionate in order to still be making a title that's 15 years old for the players. The art team's work alone speaks volumes.<br />

It's nice that Blizz is giving the non-raiders something to do. What about the players who achtually play the game?<br />
<br />
If people log in and do anything besides standing around in 1 spot, they're actually playing the game. <br />
Raiders always have content. They were literally the ONLY ones catered for during WoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can kind of understand where people are coming from.<br />
<br />
As an example, I loved playing shadow priest back in MoP, but its playstyle has been completely overhauled in the expansions that followed.<br />
<br />
Being an altoholic meant that I could simply choose another class and be on my merry way - but what if that was your only character and suddenly you couldn't bear to play it anymore? It wouldn't surprise me if people quit because of it.<br />
<br />
I don't mind Blizzard overhauling broken classes, but taking a perfectly fluid spec and breaking it? Hard to justify that.</div></div><hr />

The irony being that outside of just tedious grinding, Vanilla was know as the most casual and accessible MMO on the Market. Mostly due to the fact the combat was braindead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Becuase it is so much fun to wait 4 hours for rares... DO you focking remember Tanaan Jungle's 4 rares in WoD? The bird, the draenei, the machine and the nasty big orc? Ohh boy those were SO MUCH FUN. Running your PC and wasting energy just to wait for 4 NPCs... while you were watching some garbage show...</div></div><hr />

Thank you.. someone with a brain. Vanilla WoW was super casual compared to the competitors. That has always, always been the main focus of Blizzard. Because casual = more players = more money. It's that simple.</div></div><hr />

In timeless isle (MoP) everyone just used the raretimer add-on to track the rares. I'm sure the same will happen in mechagon.</div></div><hr />

I have to laugh at what you are saying because when WoW was released back in 2004, Everquest players would hurl insults and shite in WoW's general direction for being too casual friendly..</div></div><hr />

<br />
How hard is to get geared now vs classic ? &quot;Hard&quot; oxford definition nº3 : &quot;Requiring a great deal of endurance or effort&quot;. For the pedantic individuals. <br />
<br />
Also &quot;Braindead&quot; as your opinion.<br />
<br />
The whole 3 months thing is such nonsense. Maybe if you only get to play 1 hour each day or something.</div></div><hr />

I'm not criticising casual focused gameplay and classic wow is objectively less casual than current wow.<br />
<br />
Because you are saying in a round about way that to you WoW is hardcore, compare that to games like Everquest where the consequences of dying after level 6 will have you lose XP, and before it was changed you would also lose any gear that you had as well.. So yeah compared to Everquest, WoW is super casual friendly..</div></div><hr />

Private servers alter how abilities and such work so that those specs that weren't viable became playable. In live Classic, expect shadow priests to only do pvp and nothing else.

You are correct. In vanilla, we had a reasonably good raiding guild put together. We had at least one shadow priest most raids, plenty of rogues for DPS, a warrior tank, a druid tank and a prot pally tank.. yes, the paladin was able to tank everything in vanilla that we ever faced... if memory serves me, we cleared everything up to Naxx and 2 or 3 of the wings in Naxx... never made it to Sindragosa or Kel'thazad.</div></div><hr />

The thing is, just because you bring ONE spec doesn't mean its good. We're talking one shadow priest out of 30ish DPS in 40 man raids. ONE moonkin. ONE feral druid.<br />
<br />
Just because you CAN clear with a prot paladin or bear doesn't mean its a good tank; it just means its passable if the raid picks up the slack.<br />
<br />
Then you compare it to the 10-15 mages/warlocks/etc and 10-15 warriors/rogues/etc.<br />
<br />
Hybrid dps is the laughing stock of vanilla once you meet the very low niche requirements.</div></div><hr />

No, but those ONE shadow priest or ONE moonkin or feral were very beneficial, almost required in some instances.<br />
<br />
Only real outlier though was warriors.... 9-10 warriors minimum per raid, warriors were fucking OP in vanilla.</div></div><hr />

You are horribly misinformed. This is not at all similar to the legendary system, each equipment slot has a bonus assigned to them, so all you need to do is buy the correct equipment slot for the bonus you want, now they should probably add the bonus to the token tool tip for the sake of clarity but if people are too lazy to look up stuff online then that is kinda their problem and not blizzards.</div></div><hr />

No shit. Every single class and spec needs a rework. They need new abilities and skills.<br />

Honestly, complexity and adaptation are the things I look for in a video game. Games like Dark Souls and Dragon's Dogma, and any MMO pretty much(even WoW with a new class/spec), gives you so many options and it is fun to change them out and experiment with them, and learn new things, and enjoy that depth of gameplay.<br />
<br />
Who is quitting games because they are too complex? Is this a mobile game? Who leaves the game for 6 months and comes back and quits because they got a buff? This is a PC-only-game, it should be MORE complex than games on other platforms, considering it is also a MMO. Revamps are meant to fix broken things, I assume. Do these players want to keep playing broken specs?<br />
<br />
Also, can these people who are holding up class redesigns by quitting be reasoned with? Can they just add a popup when they haven't logged in for 6 months that says &quot;we buffed your class, it was broken, but it may play differently, here is 2 weeks game time to help you get accustomed to the new abilities&quot; or something. I mean, if this really is the case, aren't these people who are protest quitting over class changes, and forcing the rest of us to wait years for these important changes, effectively hurting the game and the fans who understand the necessity for these changes?<br />
<br />
What about people from Legion who come back to play BFA and see their class has drastically changed, and desperately needs a revamp? I could definitely see that scenario play out more than the scenario mentioned above.</div></div><hr />

I think the record is 5 or 6 days played to 60. Fastest I ever managed was just a hair under 10. That's close to 240 hours to get to level 60. So... 1 hour a day for 3 months probably isn't getting you to 60.<br />

Later raids (bwl aq naxx) one shadow or a &quot;support priest&quot; with shadow weaving was a huge benefit. Balance was always questionable but there was a reason some took them.<br />

On paper this sounds good but on practice it’s really not a benefit. Being able to boost your rep gains by minor things like the human racial won’t really get you to the next story point any faster until your near the end and all the little bits have added up. Then you have alts, if you want to get something at the end of a rep gated story you have to do the whole rep all over again compared to the soly times based system where you can just go though the storyline when it’s all unlocked.</div></div><hr />

How can we speed it up when you only give us a limited amount of WQ's to gain rep? The story is still gated no matter how you cut it.<br />
<br />
Well the difference is you can grind it as fast as you like - there's no, I gotta wait two weeks and do nothing. It still is technically gated but it feels much better to know once I hit revered or w/e it will be there for me</div></div><hr />

Classic has to be out and proven a success before there's any talk of other iterations. With the release schedule, will it even have been completely released by the time Blizzcon hits?<br />
&quot;So much focus&quot;, well of course, because we don't even have a release date for 8.2 yet. Just you wait. WoW news draw a crowd, be it a new cinematic (5.2 million views in 2 weeks on Safe Haven for example), a new major patch or the launch of an old version.</div></div><hr />

They're all things players can utilise to increase rep gains.<br />
<br />
It was much, much better in 5.1 when you could double rep gains at Revered across your account and got story dolled out every two days' worth of dailies, but just because there are only a few ways to get minor rep gains in BFA doesn't mean rep can't be sped up faster than time gating.<br />
<br />
Time gating cannot be sped up unless Blizzard changes the system. Rep gating can be, even by small increments. Their statement, as weak as it is, is more correct than claiming rep locking can't be sped up.<br />
<br />
I also forgot the world quests that give bonus rep and the World Quest event that gives a 50% boost to reputation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth and Essences<br />
Rise of Azshara is the fruits of a lot of Blizzard's reflection on feedback they've been hearing from the community since Battle for Azeroth first came out.<br />
This should be reworded to correctly reflect the feedback they had been hearing from the community since the first BfA beta PTR opened.<br />
<br />
All of these wonderful fixes that Bliz are implementing based on player feedback were raised multiple, multiple, multiple times since day one of the BfA PTR however they were ignored in their entirety by the hubris of the dev team after all they have told you how to have fun the “correct” way.<br />
<br />
Further, when you develop to a timeline it will always compromise the end product as it is better to launch an expansion with known lazy design and multiple bugs so they can drink in the money as soon as possible after all such bugs and lazy design can always be “fixed” in later patches.<br />
But reverting to the original “release when it’s ready” credo would be admitting that the development by time line method results in subpar expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Essence system functions much like the glyph system in that once you learn as essence, you are free to switch them in and out in either a rested area or by using a Tome of the Clear Mind.<br />
So exactly like the original glyph system with a proper glyph UI (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wAPVJLuDcCE/maxresdefault.jpg) where you could make decisions based on player game style, the same one that Bliz removed in WoD.<br />
Again reverting to the original glyph system and UI would be admitting that the MoP glyph system was far superior.<br />
<br />
<br />
There will be no time-gating in Nazjatar, but some reputation requirements to pieces of the major story for pacing and passage of time.<br />
Using reputation thresholds to advance the story feels better than rigid weekly chapters that you have to just wait until next week to unlock. There's something the player can do to speed it up.<br />
The “no time gating” statement does not guarantee the rate of gaining such reputation will be able to be levelled by grinding mobs out, the rep may be tied to daily quests and world bosses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Benthic gear will help fill gaps in gear acquisition.<br />
The baseline Benthic tokens are BoA so you can use them to catch up your alts.<br />
So BOA gear tokens and gear currency are back, this is great news.<br />
<br />
It took far too long for Bliz to finally to allow players to gain some certainty over gear set pieces with a well-tested system with a proven track record; why it was removed in the first place? It was probably, once again, due to players having fun the wrong way.<br />
<br />
After all of the half-truths and outright lies that spew forth from Ion’s mouth I cannot just accept what he says on face value, I will wait for player feedback before I accept that things are really getting better.</div></div><hr />

It is more jarring to endure large parts, or an entire expansion underdeveloped. There are some vocal voices in forums that will always feel change is not good, you cannot appease them if you want to evolve your game. But if a class is in such a problematic place that it's genuinely unfun to play, it makes people quit. The state of Demonology during Legion is a great example.<br />
<br />
It's obvious that it is a planning/resource-saving decision, but honestly, I think it also shows that there is a bit of disconnect in realizing what needs to flow in the everyday gameplay, so it doesn't trickle through the entire game. Features such as islands or warfronts, are directly going to feel that much worse to play if you aren't enjoying your class, because all you do in them (realistically, I actually kind of enjoy the resource gathering for Warfronts but it's a pretty underdeveloped part of them) is combat. If that wasn't the case, maybe we wouldn't burn out so fast on that content.</div></div><hr />

We had at least one shadow priest most raids, plenty of rogues for DPS, a warrior tank, a druid tank and a prot pally tank.. yes, the paladin was able to tank everything in vanilla that we ever faced... if memory serves me, we cleared everything up to Naxx and 2 or 3 of the wings in Naxx... never made it to Sindragosa or Kel'thazad.<br />
<br />
Don't BS. Paladins had no taunt and couldn't crush immune. Druid tanks could at least be mana sponges I guess but warrior tanks were the only tank you should be running unless you were cursed with having a subpar tank an officer gm or gm's friend.

This is the part I don't get about Blizzard. I don't fault them for trying new stuff, but what they get wrong is that after they've tried something new and it fails, they won't revert to what worked previously...they just keep trying more new stuff.<br />
<br />
I think the game evolving is great, I just think the major overhaul it gets every two years is too jarring and game changing. Focus on QoL updates, then change a thing or two; and always listen to feedback early. Too often we hear people give feedback during beta only to get flamed with &quot;it's just beta, relax&quot;. The whole point of beta is to give feedback, and when the answer to beta feedback is, &quot;try on live what you already don't like on beta and see if it's better after it's live&quot; makes it feel like they aren't listening...and if their response is &quot;but we are listening&quot;, then it feels like, &quot;we just don't care&quot;...which is probably worse.<br />

<br />
I was planning on coming back for 8.2 but quite frankly, after playing on the PTR, I don't see the point.<br />
<br />
I know, I know. I'm just a sheep jumping into the blizz bashing wagon... But hey, I played WoW vanilla beta... I played retail until last november... BFA is the first damn time I lost hope so hardly into blizzard. I wish they would do something to make me thing &quot;Oh, yeah I really want to experience that!&quot; but right now... their overall big silence... The way they seem to still be trying to cut corners on fixing the game...<br />
<br />
I think they are trying to do just enough to not lose too much subs until the next expansion while putting all their efforts on that next expansion. I even think WoD was better than BFA. I stayed through WoD... I levelled a ton of alts, but I stayed through it. WoD main issue IMO is the lack of content. Some bad decisions too but... mostly how you logged in, checked your garrison and logged out.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if Classic was supposed to come in later and they just went &quot;shit, let's put the priority on it so we can get back some subs! Which might work for me actually. But I'm so bitter and frustrated at what they do that I might not even.<br />

Plus, I really liked Sylvanas's character before BFA. Now I just hate her and wish for her to die a horrible death. Which is part of BFA issues. They gave us a fricking mustache twirling vilain while talking about being &quot;morally gray&quot;. I hope the next expansion is just us waking up after legion and it was just a bad dream from the emerald nightmare / N'Zoth and Sylvanas knew what was happening and just went &quot;I'll make the most outrageous things to make the alliance understand that from now on, don't fuck with the horde or a shit-load of people will die&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How hard is to get geared now vs classic ? &quot;Hard&quot; oxford definition nº3 : &quot;Requiring a great deal of endurance or effort&quot;. For the pedantic individuals. <br />
<br />
Also &quot;Braindead&quot; as your opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
world record for 1-60 was 4 days 20 hours played, that was back then, by now much more efficnet routes have come along.<br />
<br />
so i think they can lower it to 4 days played. no lifing that means just over a week of play.<br />
<br />
even if you are a normla player, i doubt a normal player would go from 1 week to 12 weeks play to get to max....<br />

8.2 is the “Fix it Patch”? Last time I checked the PTR there is still Titanforging, CRZ, sharding, mediocre class gameplay, useless talents, and no PvP vendors.<br />
<br />
I did spot 2 good updates in this post:<br />
1) Making story content rep gated instead of time gated<br />
2) Actually rare mobs<br />
<br />
some people liek titanforging<br />
people like crz<br />
people like sharding<br />
&quot;mediocre&quot; subjective mate<br />
useless talents? there will ALWAYS be useless talents<br />
no pvp vendors? ok and?<br />
it seems you are trying to make this the &quot;i dont like it therefore it should be removed&quot; patch.<br />
<br />
i dont like shamans, they should be removed from the game, shit game if not removed, i also dont like pally bubble, dk anti magic shield, rogue stealth, and mage iceblock, remove them all blizz they are shit parts ruining the game, oh also remove pvp and mythic raiding, there game fixed, cause i say so.<br />

I still don't understand where this &quot;CLASSIC IS DOOOOOOOOOMED&quot; mentality comes from, if it was so bad why did it sell so well and spawn a game that outlasted every other MMO on the market, im almost convinced the current wow fans just legitimately hate popular things because it's cool.<br />
why were leeches so popular? so why dont we bring them back, they were so popular and commonly used back then, why dont we use them now?<br />
<br />
sometimes things are good back in their time, but then you go &quot;oh maybe they arnt that good&quot; or &quot;maybe they wernt good at all&quot;<br />

Anyone starting to get Destiny 2 vibes from the quality and language used around these updates? &quot;This will be the fix-it patch!&quot; &quot;This will add so many new types of loot&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This will fix the looting&quot;<br />
<br />
It sounds EXACTLY like Destiny 2, a game WoW stupidly tried to emulate throughout Legion with &quot;legiondaries (aka exotics)&quot; and the ridiculous updates of this xpac.<br />
<br />
uhh..<br />
l....legion released BEFORE destiny 2 mate...<br />
<br />
also btw destiny did fix itself, forsaken made the game a major success... almost sounds like a specific diablo game that was shit, then an expansion came along that made it into a massive hit for years.<br />

Paladins had no taunt and couldn't crush immune. Druid tanks could at least be mana sponges I guess but warrior tanks were the only tank you should be running unless you were cursed with having a subpar tank an officer gm or gm's friend. Paladins were also a mana based tank which yikes.<br />
<br />
allow me to correct you in regards to prot paladins (i had one in vanilla).<br />
1. you could get defense capped as a paladin, you had to use off pieces rather then set pieces in some slots to do so but it was more then possible.<br />
2. you actually had an easier time to hold aggro single target then a warrior since seal of fury generated a lot of threat and reckoning procs just put you ahead of so many warriors.<br />
3. paladin tanks were not mana tanks, unless you consider the odd self healing weaving a flash of light between slow boss attacks for extra threat mana. consecration was as or a little more useful as thunderclap in that regard, and that was the only spell you bothered with mostly other then the odd judgement<br />
4. our &quot;defensives&quot; were actually more powerful, the proper use of divine shield, blessing of protection, and lay on hands to negate incoming damage or save a team mate was the mark of a truly skilled paladin tank.<br />
<br />
were warriors better tanks in terms of toolset? yes, were paladins limited in their toolset, offcourse, was the entire content clearable with a paladin tank or 2 in the team? donno, we had a rotating tank team in vanilla of 3-4 warriors, 2 druids and 2 paladins that shared the tanking between them and we were working on sapphiron when TBC arrival killed our main raid. we were not world first, we were not speeding through content, we did have enormous ammounts of fun and randprin, the thunderfury wielding paladin, tanked, healed and sometimes stood in the tunnel after mag and OOC rezzed people...</div></div><hr />

They've been doing it since Cataclysm; remove content and then add it back in later as a 'brand new feature'.<br />
It's despicable, but I guess as long as they never remove mog/pet/mount farming then the core skinnerbox demographic will never have a reason to complain.</div></div><hr />

No, I follow you perfectly. You have an understandable problem with some people in the classic community (there are some who are indeed toxic) but you, yourself, are just as toxic as the worst of that community. Self reflection can't seriously be so difficult for you now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two problems with your argument about paladin tanks. First, defense capping made you uncrittable, not uncrushable. Uncrushable required you to push the chance of crushing blow off the hit table by making it impossible for you to take an unmitigated hit. Second, reckoning does nothing if you're defense capped. You never take a crit.</div></div><hr />

Defense capped does not equal crush immune. Crush immune means pushing all crushing blows off the table which was only possible with shield block until wrath. Holy shield only did 30% redoubt did another 30 but couldn't be relied on to always be up. If you actually gave a paladin TF over a warrior you were obviously one of the guilds cursed with a pally gm/gm's friend. Assuming your guild existed and you aren't blowing smoke. <br />
<br />
Oh and if you are defense capped you aren't taking crits I'll leave you to figure out why that makes your story a problem.</div></div><hr />

This &quot;tank paladin in classic&quot; has either no clue or was just doing dungeons. I've never encountered a paladin in classic that really did raids, because they just couldn't (!) tank them; mostly because of the lack of taunt. You couldn't do the simplest things like taunt rotations. Hell, even in BC paladin tanking was mostly shit just because you needed special gear and still you were just subpar. And yes, I've played a paladin both in classic and BC.</div></div><hr />

I was expecting it to be more in line with legendaries not in term of power, but on the interesting scale (not talking about the flat dmg boosts traits mind you).<br />
<br />
I was planning on coming back for 8.2 but quite frankly, after playing on the PTR, I don't see the point.<br />
<br />
I know, I know. I'm just a sheep jumping into the blizz bashing wagon... But hey, I played WoW vanilla beta... I played retail until last november... BFA is the first damn time I lost hope so hardly into blizzard. I wish they would do something to make me thing &quot;Oh, yeah I really want to experience that!&quot; but right now... their overall big silence... The way they seem to still be trying to cut corners on fixing the game...<br />
<br />
I think they are trying to do just enough to not lose too much subs until the next expansion while putting all their efforts on that next expansion. I even think WoD was better than BFA. I stayed through WoD... I levelled a ton of alts, but I stayed through it. WoD main issue IMO is the lack of content. Some bad decisions too but... mostly how you logged in, checked your garrison and logged out.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if Classic was supposed to come in later and they just went &quot;shit, let's put the priority on it so we can get back some subs! Which might work for me actually. But I'm so bitter and frustrated at what they do that I might not even.<br />

<br />
Yeah the whole Azerite system is just a husk of what made Legion great. They learned all the wrong lessons from Legion. This system is all grind, no reward. No interesting decisions to make.<br />
<br />
Like you, I was a total altoholic in WoD, and am doing the same now. Wake me up when we get Artifacts and gameplay decisions back.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lawtk</div><div class="date">2019-06-04, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The downfall is when they lost/removed product focused people from leadership. I've seen it many times in my own career where a larger company buys up the smaller innovative shops in order to get access to their revenue and IP. Then they put one of &quot;their&quot; people in charge of the unit and that's when things start to go downhill. If you want a software company to remain product and customer focused, you have to put those type of people in leadership, not the scrubs they continue to find. <br />
<br />
As a 15+ year vet of the game, I've taken 2 brakes from the game (one at the end of vanilla, came back for BC, and one at the end of Cata). Both of those only lasted a few months and then I saw teasers that got me excited about playing again. I was thoroughly upset at the end of Legion with all of the Ele Shammy changes, having played Ele since Cata. I weathered some pretty bad storms, but what they did was just make it boring AF and removed any class fantasy they actually had. So, I switched to warlock and I enjoyed that for a little bit of time, but alas, like most veteran players, I have succumbed to the absolute suckery that BFA is and decided that my time and money are no longer worth the waiting.<br />
<br />
I've watched/read about all of the 8.2 changes that are coming. I will agree that I do see Blizz trying to change things, but at this point for me, it's a little too late. My ability to &quot;wait&quot; has been used up and I can no longer be patient for soon™. I do hope that they are listening to the community that does stick around and find ways to bring back the game that everyone loves. Most people seem to believe that is vanilla, I do not. Going backward will appease everyone for a little while, but I feel that will be ephemeral and most will yearn for the retail game to remove the elements that took away the RPG and community and focus on how to go forward, rather than escaping to the past.</div></div><hr />
