Mad Max is a movie, not a game... borderlands is a game and so is overwatch.<br />
So that map has borderlands vibe to it, mad max hardly had super heroes flying around in high tech equipment.</div></div><hr />

A few BlizzCons ago, there was a Q&amp;A question about why Jaina had such a seemingly sudden change of personality, and a popular YouTuber named JesseCox jokingly suggested that she was a dreadlord in disguise and the real Jaina was dead.<br />
<br />
It just snowballed from there.</div></div><hr />
