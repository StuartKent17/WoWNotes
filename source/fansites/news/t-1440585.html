It’s the New Year, and 2014 is going to be a big one for World of Warcraft. This November marks the game’s 10-year anniversary and the 20-year anniversary of the entire Warcraft series. We’re looking forward to celebrating these milestones with everyone, but in the meantime, we’ve got a few Warlords of Draenor–related updates to share.<br />
<br />
Preparing for Battle<br />
At BlizzCon, we laid out our plans to send you into battle against some of the biggest and baddest enemies in Warcraft history. While the Iron Horde gears up for war on Draenor, back here on earth we’re making preparations for the expansion’s upcoming closed beta test. If you’d like to be considered, now’s a great time to make sure you’re opted in (https://www.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html) to Warcraft betas and that the hardware specs in your Beta Profile (https://www.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html) are up to date. (Full instructions can be found here (http://www.battle.net/support/en/article/beta-opt-in-instructions).)<br />
<br />

<br />
Report from the Front Lines<br />
From the outset, players will find themselves hurled into a chaotic conflict with the Iron Horde at a new Dark Portal on Draenor. The situation for Azeroth is grim, and the war effort needs heroes—from new recruits to retired champions to warriors still tending wounds earned at the Siege of Orgrimmar. To get everyone straight to the action, when you buy the expansion, it will come with a boost to level 90 for one character on your WoW account. We’re getting ready to test the functionality for that on the PTR, and we wanted to provide a quick update on how it will work with the upcoming expansion presales.<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor will be available for pre-purchase digitally Soon™, and we’re once again planning to have standard digital and Digital Deluxe versions (along with a physical Collector’s Edition—more on that at a later date). This time, if you pre-purchase the Digital Deluxe edition you’ll get your exclusive World of Warcraft pet and mount right away, allowing you to bring a little bit of Draenor past into Azeroth present.<br />
<br />
In addition, when you pre-purchase either digital version, we’re going to grant you your level-90 boost at the time of pre-purchase. That’s a little different from the plan we laid out at BlizzCon, but based on the feedback, it’s obvious that many of you would like the chance to get acquainted with a new class before heading into the expansion. This will also give more players the opportunity to experience the current end-game content and the events leading up to Garrosh’s exodus to Draenor. Maybe you’ll get your Legendary cloak from Wrathion and level 90–100 Heirloom weapon in the process.<br />
<br />

<br />
Bolster the Ranks<br />
We’ve also heard feedback from players that they’d be interested in boosting multiple characters to 90, including alts they play with friends on other factions and realms. We’ve been evaluating ways to make that possible without having players go through roundabout methods (such as purchasing multiple boxes and performing multiple character transfers), and in the near future we’ll be testing out a feature that gives you the option to purchase a character upgrade directly. We’ll have more information to share later—including details on our character-upgrade plans for Asian regions where players don’t buy expansion boxes—but you’ll start seeing pieces of the process soon on the PTR, so keep an eye out.<br />
<br />
We’re looking forward to the closed beta test, and we’re excited we’re able to give players their character boost immediately upon pre-purchasing—hopefully that will help tide you over while you’re waiting for the epic battle for Draenor to begin. Stay tuned for more information on presales and our beta plans, and we hope you’ll join in and help us test this stuff out when it hits the PTR.</div></div><hr />

Letting people buy 90's is fine. WoW is an old game, some of us have been playing for years. It's just not fun leveling anymore. (6 90's here)Also people will easily learn their class from 90-100. It doesn't take long to learn class basics</div></div><hr />

Beta indications and PTR &quot;soon&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ohhh it's heating up, I hope.<br />
<br />
Also, in before QQ, even without selling them on the store, you'd be able to just buy another copy of WoD, so, GET OVER IT. /drama.<br />
<br />
Let's just wait and see the prices and the implementation, remember we are supposed to get a DK starting area style &quot;lesson&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, early 90 and early mount/pet, is just sick, thank you. &lt; Oh snap, we confirmation it's a pet AND mount for CE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said anyone who boosts their class will have limited abilities and go through a DK-starter-zone-esque situation where they slowly earn each of their spells and are taught how to use them. Back in like Vanilla/TBC, it wasn't uncommon for a Mage who bought their account to learn their rotation, but be completely unaware of those lesser known spells like Amplify/Dampen/Detect magic. So I understand the reasoning behind a small little tutorial trial of some sort to teach you the things you may have missed.</div></div><hr />

Early June(First Two Weeks) Warlords of Draenor goes live.<br />

If the cost is too low, people QQ about to many free 90s running around. If the cost it too high, people will call them greedy. If they don't do it at all, than the cost is REALLY high due to people buying new boxes and getting 90s that way, and they are still called greedy. There is literally no correct path for them. Maybe people will say that the correct path is to not do it at all... but at this point in the games life I think its a pretty decent addition.</div></div><hr />

Hell no, this game is so old that the majority of players have levelled up multiple characters.<br />
<br />
I've got 7 90's. I'm now interested in seeing what rogues are like at max level. But I cannot stomach going through the grind again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're buying it from a store - picking it up yourself - I can't see them doing anything to accommodate that - however since BC I've gotten my CE's from EB (I know - but it's the best I can do since Amazon.ca simply sucks) and I've received my copy by at least the day of launch if not a day earlier.<br />
<br />
As for the price - I can't see it being 50+ nor should it. They are after people like me (those with multiple 90's already who for one reason or another have never levelled a certain character type) or returning players. Pricing it too high will simply alienate those it's targeted at, achieving nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see it being that much. If anything I can see it being $20+. Reason being is leveling isn't that hard just a pain for most. Also, you can buy a new copy of WoW and RaF whatever toon you want and just powerhouse through 1-85 rather easily in a day or two. So I see it being cheaper to buy a new copy (so they get a box sale) and possible extra month or two + transfer cost for them.</div></div><hr />

I am very very unok with offering purchases of character upgrades. especially in a game that I pay a monthly fee for. It is just starting to become way way too much now. they pay a team to make store stuff with the money we use for content work, and although it is a separate team and does not slow things down these are things we could get in game. I have played for 9 years and am very very worried about the direction this is going when I wasn't very worried at all just a moment before reading this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To put it into perspective, this is the same thing as the Scroll of Resurrection got upgraded to a level 85 boost. No one would care about that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will bring more people to play the game, most of my friends who would want to play WoW are turned off by having to catch up in the first place. They are treating WoD as WoW 2.0, and that's completely fine by me! <br />
<br />
Buying a 90 doesn't give anyone an advantage over somebody else, everyone will be starting at 90 anyway! It's NOT pay to win!<br />
<br />
You've played WoW for years and have had to get your 90s the long way? Who cares! You had the opportunity to play all that time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good on Blizzard for making WoW more accessible for the masses.</div></div><hr />

It should cost less than a server transfer, since it's a character with no achievements or gear or professions and you'll still have to level to 100.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. Anything learned from mobs that die in a couple of hits won't be correct anyways. Skilled players don't need x levels of demolishing trash to be any good, and bad players learn nothing regardless.<br />
<br />
Personally, I feel this is all great news.<br />
<br />
Game is old guys; some of us just want to get to what's relevant and skip the ever increasing legacy material. Those that don't, well, don't! It's optional and not recommended for NEW players (not to be confused with returning/veteran players).</div></div><hr />

Naaa thx it´s already a joke to lvl up to 90. <br />
/played total 2 days, not worth to purchase that , let´s see the next microtransaction they come with, i guess it will be some kind of valor//jp//honor//conquest point double exp win rate or some thing for lazzy pple :D<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone has claimed leveling to be difficult for quite some time now. I personally don't buy anything from the bnet store, but if someone wants to spend money to get max level of the previous expansion, why should I care? I have a group of friends/guild-mates that I play with so random baddies (not saying I'm the best, but there are lots of people both better and worse at WoW than me.) are only very rarely encountered.</div></div><hr />

If people want to buy them, also fine, it is their money. Some people like leveling, some people don't. However having a 90 does not mean you know how to play the class. It just means you have a higher level character.<br />
<br />
Really in the end, it does not affect my game-play one way or another so I really can't seem to get upset about people being able to toss money Blizzards way.</div></div><hr />

Hell, I'd be surprised if the tutorial didn't make some people better than the average person playing a new class at 90. (Assuming the tutorial isn't just completely useless and at least has a basic rotation and such, though I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't.)<br />
<br />
I agree completely. A lot of people who have leveled up tons are STILL playing their class/spec the same way they have since Vanilla .. which is the wrong way to do things. At least with this method players are forced to learn how to properly play newly revamped classes. I wonder if this training ground for classes can be accessed for all the baddies currently out there.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talonkaine</div><div class="date">2014-01-17, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard... I've always supported everything you have done, but being able to purchase level 90 boosts makes me very angry. <br />
<br />
If you look at my account I am about to have 16 level 90 characters... working towards having 22 characters.. 11 from each faction, covering one of each race. This is my goal before WoD. I've been working on leveling all these toons since Vanilla WoW. I've spend hundred and hundreds of dollars with race and faction changes to get my toons on the sames servers and factions. When I get all 11 classes on both Horde and Alliance this will be a great accomplishment that people may find rather impressive for the amount of time that was involved. <br />
<br />
However, come the near future as you say... someone with a big pocket book can purchase and achieve what has take me YEARS to accomplish. This to me is a huge sell out, and just another way for the company to make a quick buck. Not to mention a HUGE kick in my private parts. Even if they were $100+ per level 90 character I am still against this feature being added. <br />
<br />
Please do not ruin this game.</div></div><hr />

If it holds true from previous expansions, they pick at random from everyone that is opt-ed in for beta testing. They invite people in waves over the course of the beta, and eventually let quite a lot of people in before the beta ends.</div></div><hr />

Hell they could even setup some kind of deal with ups/fedex/etc where they sell it digitally, you get the codes, and then the shipping company brings you the box in a few days.

You don't learn anything about your class as you level to begin with so I don't understand where these comments of &quot;baww it'll inundate the game with even more baddies&quot; comes from. 90% of the people who play this game are terrible. This isn't news.</div></div><hr />

This wouldn't be an issue if this was not an MMO game. But WoW is an MMO game where you play with other players. Or at the very least, YOU should be playing with other players. Such actions do in fact affect other players. Consider this, a new player sees the shiny button and skips leveling by rolling a warrior. Here are the results:<br />
<br />
- skipped leveling content, one less potential tank during leveling process, LFx for leveling content working sub optimally<br />
- skipped leveling content, one less potential tank who actually learned how to tank along the way, LFx systems dealing with sub peformance giving blizz even more reason to nerf LFx content to the ground.<br />
- skipped leveling content, the player literally ignore 90% of the entire game content. A new guy ignoring old content because its old does not make sense because he is new to the game and he didn't even saw it.<br />
<br />
If WoW was a single player game then none of those issues would be a problem. But WoW is not a single player game.</div></div><hr />

It will bring more people to play the game, most of my friends who would want to play WoW are turned off by having to catch up in the first place. They are treating WoD as WoW 2.0, and that's completely fine by me! <br />
<br />
Buying a 90 doesn't give anyone an advantage over somebody else, everyone will be starting at 90 anyway! It's NOT pay to win!<br />
<br />
You've played WoW for years and have had to get your 90s the long way? Who cares! You had the opportunity to play all that time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good on Blizzard for making WoW more accessible for the masses.<br />
<br />
They also make your friends player experience much smaller because of it. You are quite literally making them buy a game only so that they will play less than 20% of it total content.<br />

You know who won't queue tank for leveling LFD? Me, because leveling again for the nth time is not fun for me. So now that I can skip that, does that mean you have one less tank? No. I was never going to do it in the first place.<br />

Honestly now, what truly new virgin player is going to get into a game just to skip parts of it? Is that how you play games? I don't know about you, but when I get into a new game, I try to savor it, and while I can't speak for anyone else...

That's actually slower than doing a combination of quests and dungeons, more so if you have/use heirlooms since it's already easy to out-level questing areas. Not to mention the added benefit of dungeon blues for slots that heirlooms don't provide.</div></div><hr />

If the queue times are actually going to be affected that much, that means those people didn't want to be doing those dungeons in the first place. Besides, queuing for dungeons is not the only way to level, questing is not that much slower, so it will remain an optional feature.</div></div><hr />

You would if you had no other choice. The fact that you would not enjoy is not an issue. MMOs arent just about you, you know.<br />

<br />
The very possibility of a new virgion player skipping content is much more damaging to everyone who interacts with them compared to &quot;suffering&quot; of doing what you normally do in MMOs.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the mentality that this will drastically reduce player skill at level 100, I just don't see it. Leveling content is too trivial to learn how to play a class in max level content.<br />

I personally hate to level and find it really boring killing 10 boars,getting some silk etc for 90 levels again on a content i already did once not counting those who have 10 alts or so.I started multiple characters and only my main is 90.This game is 9 years old any many new players(including IRL friends) do not want to start playing it just because they have so much to catch on. Considering many of the players have jobs/school i doubt they want to level a new character after an 8 hour shift+some arenas or raiding. If you played this game for a while you most likely know most skills of every class and learning a new rotation for that class wouldn't be that hard and if a new player has the instant boost to level 90 no one is forcing you to play with him if you do not want to. This will also be good for a lot of transfer issues. You want to start with your friends on a new realm but you don't want to level again? Here you go a free level 90 and go experience the new content not the old one you did once or several times. They are not selling gear/ gold or a free spot to realm/world first. I personally like this and look forward for the new expansion.</div></div><hr />

Yeah which are just as irrelevant now as they will be with a free 90.<br />
<br />
Did you level lock yourself to 70 and do all the old raids and heroics?<br />
<br />
You can always go back and see that stuff at 90 anyway. Which is how the vast majority of people sees that content these days.</div></div><hr />

Besides, queuing for dungeons is not the only way to level, questing is not that much slower, so it will remain an optional feature.<br />
<br />
That makes absolutely no sense. If they were queue-ing for a dungeon, they want to do the dungeon, or they wouldn't queue at all. Questing is very much slower than dungeons and quests combined. As I mentioned further up the thread, it's much easier to out-level a questing hub/area than it is to out-level a dungeon. And as I also mentioned, there's the added benefit of gear not covered by heirlooms, assuming the player even had or used them (or had access to them). <br />
<br />
All of this is still going to increase queue times, especially if the boost &quot;option&quot; is popular. And I'll say it again, this &quot;option&quot; isn't much of an option if it hinders the ability of other players that choose not to fork over extra money to buy an additional boosted character.</div></div><hr />

With heirlooms, RAF, effectively free epic/flying mounts, you can get through the 25 levels of TBC/WOTLK/CATA in only a 3 zones and probably as many hours. XP comes so quick and easy that people a) aren't really missing anything, b) aren't really 'learning their class' anyway, and c) aren't actually saving that much time by buying a lv90 toon anyway. <br />
<br />
There is a lot of WOW out there for people who want to explore. But for (dare I say) most people, playing the current end-game content is the goal. If it takes them 3 months to get there to play with friends, people won't bother. It's that simple.<br />
<br />
MAYBE a good idea would be, if blizz gets the technology working, to allow people to scale down to appropriate levels for not just dungeons but quests as well. That could be pretty cool.</div></div><hr />

Possibly true. It would be handy for them to announce sometime soon that dungeon scaling is in. That would solve that if it's going to work the way I think it will: players scaling down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming LFD will get ruined by it is a stretch. LFD uses cross realm pools to draw from. Assume the pool drops by ??%, as people use the Boost option, there is ZERO reason to believe that the balance between tank / heals / dps will be effected by this. So unless all the tanks take the option, you are unlikely to even notice.<br />
<br />
I have currently the full 11 @ 90 for Alliance, 7 @ 90 for Horde (+3 @ 85-86 and 1 @ 73)... Does this bother me? Hella No. Does this cheapen the last 8-9 years I have played WoW... Hella No! Will I use it? Hella No... <br />
<br />
Play the game how you want and let others play how they want.<br />
<br />
Levels 90-100 will teach them how to play their class. Its likely to take a similar amount of time as 85-90 did at MoP launch (~1 day) and with 1-85 taking at most 2 days they wont learn anything doing that content that they cant learn in WoD. And if they don't learn it in WoD, they were not going to learn it anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The very possibility of a new virgion player skipping content is much more damaging to everyone who interacts with them compared to &quot;suffering&quot; of doing what you normally do in MMOs.<br />
<br />
<br />
It used to be non-trivial. Players were forced to either up their peformance, learn some new quirks about their class or work with others. That's kinda what MMO and RPGs are about.<br />
<br />
I disagree with you.<br />
<br />
There's always another choice. My choice has been &quot;don't level another character, do other things instead&quot;, hence why I said you didn't lack a tank because of me now being able to skip to 90. If you're lacking more tanks in the future because they skipped, it's because they would rather skip than tank the dungeon, and that's their choice. Making it better for you makes it worse for them, see how that works?<br />
<br />
I also strongly disagree with the notion that the 90-100 player in raids will perform any worse than a person just starting in Warlords going through 1-100, because what you learn from 1-90 is not relevant enough in raiding. Leveling mobs are too trivial to learn anything but incorrect techniques. Nobody does their fully executed boss fight raiding rotation on the leveling trash, so what are they not learning that will make them terrible by comparison to what we have now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey man I see what you're saying but you don't seem to get the point, a LARGE part of this game is end game, and you can always go back and do old dungeons and etc, the whole experience is centered around being with your friends. <br />
<br />
While my friend is busy trying to level up, I'll already be doing the new content. <br />
<br />
<br />
AND let's say they didn't add this option, if I do RAF with my friend it will only take him a few days to reach level 90, that's not much more different than what blizzard is planning to do<br />
<br />
It just makes it more accessible and less daunting for new players to get to, Blizzard does stats on these kinds of things and to be honest they are losing players, and not getting many new ones, this method will help that and in the end have more players doing end game content, which is what matters the most.</div></div><hr />

Letting people buy 90's is fine. WoW is an old game, some of us have been playing for years. It's just not fun leveling anymore. (6 90's here)<br />
Dude i got over about same 90,s and about 10 85lvls, and i still thinks its retarded to buy 90lvl, there is a reason for leveling a character,and that is to learn how to play that class true leveling.

The whole thing is ridiculous. I'm in favor of one free 90 with each WoD preorder or purchase. But it should be one boosted 90 per Battle.net account. Buying your way to a full complement of level 90s just to power through the next 10 levels shouldn't happen. I get it when people say you don't learn much while leveling, but you DO learn more than if you don't level at all. You still get in-your-face popups about new spells, you still have to decide on how you want to play at level 10 and then learn your spells based around that decision, and you still get to learn - albeit to a lesser degree - various spell/skill synergies.<br />
<br />
Purchase an insta-90 and you're gonna have a spell book of skills/spells that you don't have the first clue about (unless you're paying for a 90 of a second class you already have, in which case, wtf and may I have some of your disposable income?). If I purchased an insta-90 warrior, I wouldn't know a damn thing about any of the skills in my spellbook except for Titan's Grip means RAWR TWO BIG WEAPONS. If I leveled instead, at least I'd get some kind of understanding how to play warrior melee dps and the differences between Arms and Fury. I might suck at both, but at least I'll understand more than someone whose first taste of the class is at boosted level 90.<br />

In case you hadn't noticed, this will be happening with people simply buying more copies of the game, and orchestrating fiddly transfers of characters between same-owner accounts, even if they don't add a direct microtransaction.<br />

If I purchased an insta-90 warrior, I wouldn't know a damn thing about any of the skills in my spellbook except for Titan's Grip means RAWR TWO BIG WEAPONS. If I leveled instead, at least I'd get some kind of understanding how to play warrior melee dps and the differences between Arms and Fury. I might suck at both, but at least I'll understand more than someone whose first taste of the class is at boosted level 90.<br />
<br />
Thing is levelling teaches you very little, how to level and how to play in raids/pvp are very different things.<br />
<br />
Hell, I levelled my Warrior as Arms, when I respecced to Prot at 90 I was in the same position anyway as not knowing what the hell to do anyway. When I reached max level on my priest in Cataclysm I had not a clue how Disc worked. So I read about it.<br />
<br />
There will be be noobs of course, but noobs exist anyway, and I don't think is going to make thing any worse.</div></div><hr />

It takes 2 days to reach 90 if you just put in a little bit of time... i guess blizzard is getting greedy and wants to suck more money out of the lazy people.<br />
<br />
Yup that is totally the reason, to drain the money from the lazy people by letting them by a level 90 instead of buying new copies of the game, plus Expansions and THEN paying for transfers. =.= I don't know how much you think that level 90 is going to be worth IF They ever DO it, but I don't see a level 90 costing as much as a game plus all its expansions and the transfer price.<br />
<br />
Let's say it was $30 for a 90 (just a number as most of the things you pay for don't go over $30.) even at that high price, it still wouldn't cost nearly as much as buying the battle chest, any missing expansion, and then the transfer to another server and the server transfer alone is $25.</div></div><hr />

I have all classes on 90 so I wouldn't bother with it, but I know how much I hated leveling through Pandaria every time after the first. So I can understand that people hate leveling and want to get boosted to the most recent content. I've always been of the opinion that you don't learn how to play your class during leveling but you just start learning it at max level, when things get a bit more competative. Sure, you'll understand the basics of the class you just leveled but you will not just simply master any class just by leveling it once.<br />
<br />
The whole argument about this resulting in more &quot;bad&quot; players is just silly. They are bad because they are unable to learn how to play properly. Not after leveling from 90-100 and not even after 1-100. Normal players will, while it might take some time, adapt and learn their class.</div></div><hr />

In a competitive game industry they have to appeal to new customers and to ask them to buy the new exp and then play 90 levels of old content is just unrealistic. When the latest CoD game comes out they dont make you play all past titles before you are allowed to pay for the title you bought!<br />
<br />
This had to happen at somepoint and its a sensible move. I believe anyone who is new to the game and gets the level 90 and enjoys its will probably roll other toons without paying for them anyway. How many people still play their very first toon after all.</div></div><hr />

For every player that buys a instant level 90 alt for 40-50 bucks (notice the word ALT,since your first character is free) there will be 10 people who value their money more than their spare time/enjoy leveling etc. The 90-100 zones are going to be new and that is likely all the new leveling content we will get.

P.S i was banned so this is late but did anyone else notice Ghostcrawler saying that the design team doesnt love Ogres and Arrakoa much yet compared to Worgens and Goblins from Cataclysm,is this a possible hint at Ogres for Horde and Arrakoa for alliance as playable races? Because they did say they werent hunched over in the past so i reckon they will use the Jinyu model and stick feathers on it so we can play it,and also having a main as a rogue it seems a tiny bit fishy that we can glyph to turn into any enemy we want after we pickpocket them which says to me any race &quot;could&quot; be playable and its blizz's way of secretly testing this out.</div></div><hr />

Just wtf is wrong with you arguing about how bad an OPTION to buy lv. 90, there is NO OBLIGATION to do so, yet some are moaning and foreseeing doom all over the place.<br />

Oh look I like Coke.....screw others who love Pepsi....Pepsi is evil.<br />

Wait what you drink tea in the morning....there is only one thing to drink and that is coffee pfft.<br />

Damn you Blizz. for giving players the option to get/buy a level to be with their friends and not mine who like to level....cause you know that is the only thing I like.<br />
<br />
And that goes to both sides of the argument.<br />
<br />
Its and OPTION people, its actually good to have options for diverse styles and ways of thoughts, you want to level please go ahead and do so, if you want to load on with 50 level 90's with money....IMHO if someone does that, you are utterly sickly mad.....go ahead and do so, stop arguing at the other side...it doesn't in anyway affect how you play end game WoD at level 100.<br />
<br />
There isn't a real solid con to this......people playing badly cause they didn't level isn't a valid argument, people still suck even after leveling and calling the darn class there main for the whole expansion plays worth...but a lot of pros to look for.</div></div><hr />

Let me explain: Pay to win means,that you can buy things that give you an competitive advantage over other player (Like ingame strength aka higher ilvl items). Mounts,Pets,LvL 90 dont give you any advantage over other player at lvl 100. Its just cosmetic gimmicks.</div></div><hr />

People are so angry over that ingame shop,but it existed from the beginning, called Collectors edition. &quot;Paying more money to get gimmicks like ingame Mount/pet/[...]&quot; sounds like the same thing. <br />
<br />
They also stated plenty of times that wow will never go P2W. Other games, like Riots LoL for example, also have an ingame shop, but only sell gimmics although they could easily go p2w. But they dont, because they know it would hurt more than benefit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact they are going to be offering the free 90 with PRE-purchases AND the mount and pet from deluxe/collectors editions EARLY, before the expansion is even out, just shows how desperate they really are to try and stem the flow of subscriber losses, and more importantly boost the revenue for these early quarters of 2014. <br />
<br />
The business obligation to continually provide the high levels of profit margins, that the investors have become accustomed to over the years, is putting more pressure on Blizzard to shovel more micro transactions at us at an increasing rate to make up the shortfall that the increasing sub losses are causing (especially the losses of western subs that makeup the vast majority of that revenue). It wasn't all that long ago the last mount hit the store and yesterday we get another one. That's what? the fourth store mount this expansion? and there is only 6 mounts in there at this time. I think you can expect to be getting a new store mount almost every quarter soon if Blizzard's efforts to increase subscriber numbers fails to hit the desired mark.<br />
<br />
I'm not bothered about the free 90 or the peeps who are upset about the eventual purchase of 90s on the store. That was a 100% certainty the moment they announced the free 90 catchup with the expansion as its just a natural logical business progression with the inevitable lean towards the micro transaction model.

Open up a challenging quest chain at level 100 that allows you to become a Mentor for the characters on your account, and upgrade them to level 90 at a rate of 1 per month? Or simply buy an account-bound Mentor's List of Sound Advice from a Grizzled Veteran for 10-50k gold (or Valor, or Conquest points) that you can send to one of your alts?

If the lvl 90 comes with its own DK-like starting zone where they gradually grant you abilities and help you &quot;learn the class&quot; (as hinted at Blizzcon), then you will have to pay every time you want to access this content.</div></div><hr />

It kind of shows a disregard for actual paying customers that i find a little off putting.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc02cc641aec</div><div class="date">2014-01-17, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow some people, anyway this is far from pay to win. If blizzard let you buy a level 100 too decked out in heroic purples, then yes I would agree, but 90 is not pay to win.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is very keen to get people into the new world that they have spent time developing. Sure the old expansions are nice, but they want people in the new stuff, which is why a boost to 90 will achieve this. Many, Many people have levelled to 90 on more than one toon, and I for one can't be bothered levelling up any more through old content which I am sick of seeing, so I think this is a great idea to help people like me get another class to 90 which I am interested in seeing the play style, but not so interested that I want spend hours going through old content, I have done it 9 times already, I think that is enough.<br />
<br />
And one last thing, those that think that we will have a load on new incapable players are just being silly. How many classes have different specs or even roles that people only pick up on at end game. I levelled a Paladin to 90 through healing dungeons, only really learned to tank and dps at level cap. This is the same as getting a level 90, people will learn the spec when they level up to 100. This is world of warcraft, any spec is easy to play, there is even help in the spell book about rotations and stuff, its not rocket science. Sure you may not be optimal at playing, but that will come with time, but I am sure that the vast majority of people are able to pick up a class and learn how to play it in a relatively short time period, those who think otherwise must be very cynical. <br />
<br />
This is a great move on Blizzards part, and I fully support it</div></div><hr />

It was in the game for an event leading up to the Cataclysm, implying the world would end.<br />
<br />

<br />
Honestly, this is how I see everyone moaning about the fact that this free 90's boost will be end and that it will destroy Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Firstly, you're afraid LFR will get worse? That you're going to be playing with unskilled people who don't know what they're doing? <br />
HAVE YOU LOOKED AROUND IN THE CURRENT LFR? I've seen people go into catform, hide from combat during boss fights. I have seen Warriors in full PvP gear equip a shield and be convinced they could tank, Rogues do nothing but auto-attack, Hunters who've let their pet run lose and pull trash as if there is no tomorrow. LFR is already bad as it is, this won't change a thing. I enjoy doing LFR as it is (yeah, call me crazy). I don't have time to see the raids on a normal level, so LFR is a good solution for me. People aren't forced to do LFR, you don't NEED the gear from LFR.<br />
<br />
Secondly, you're afraid that PvP will get fucked over by these players who don't know what to do? Well look at it this way, for every freshly dinged 90 in your team, there will be one in the other team as well. It won't take long for these people to realize they're horrible and this will more than likely suck the joy out of PvP for them. And if you play Arena there is absolutely nothing to worry about as you pick the people you play with yourself.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, not everyone who picks up this game as a new player is a braindead player who doenst know what to do. People will learn their class quick enough and if they don't they never will. But then again, those people already play the game today. <br />
<br />
Yes the expantion will probably spawn new players, but it will also bring players back who already have experience with the game. Players who know what to do and players who probably know that they should try their new class/specc on a dummy before using it in a dungeon/raid. <br />
<br />
People are afraid of all these new kind of scenario's where they will encounter people who are compleate noobs. Guess what, you'll always come across noobs. In my opinion that's fine. I've been playing this game since April 2007, i was once a noob, there has been a time where I was competely clueless about what I was doing. In my years i've met them all, noobs, pro's, elitist jersk, kids, adults, everything. It's part of the experience, reach out, give a noob a hand, some advice and tips.<br />
<br />
No doubt this post will get lost in this sea of rage and what not, but I felt I needed to make this statement. Agree with me or not, I think this is what will be the case come WoD.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, buying an instant 90... I mean, first they try to fill the leveling world, now they try to empty it again. Again, buying services like this always promote bad design decisions, because those will no longer be based around the quality of the game (or in this case the leveling experience), but based solely on making even more money from services. Simple examples: You can forget further balancing of low level BGs, instances, questing or mob difficulty if this comes to pass, because &quot;if you don't like it you can buy the instant 90&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude, every level 90 is stronger than every level 1, whether it was boosted or not. However, any given boosted 90 will likely be less powerful that the average level 90 today that has done any raid content (LFR included). I predict the boosted 90 will be made with either 384 greens or 425 blues, something along those lines, gear for the leveling 90, not the raiding 90. If you've done any MoP endgame, it will be harder for the boosted 90 to survive in Draenor than it will be for you. There is no &quot;win&quot; in this &quot;pay-to-win&quot; boost other than the fact that you've skipped a lot of dead time that you would have spent trudging yourself through useless, cut-up, old, irrelevant content. Not much &quot;win&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats because 1-89 is nothing like raiding at level 90. you can easily get to 90 by pressing 2 buttons, would teach you anything about your class. The mentioned &quot;DK-like&quot; tutorial you will have to go through is most likely gonna teach you alot more about how to play your char than levling ever will. <br />
<br />
You could argue that you learn a bit about tanking/healing while doing dungeons leveling up. So for the pre-ordered lvl 90s it's probably gonna make tanks in LFR even worse (or it might be that people that know how to play pick up a second tank charr and carry LFR). As for the dungeonfinder queues beeing longer. why? are you asuming that all the people that use 90boost are tanks/healers? I know I rather boost my dps charrs up and level a class that can tank/heal for faster queues. It's more likely dungeonfinder queues will go DOWN..</div></div><hr />

Very basic definition of pay to win is that it allow you to buy character power. Leveling give your character more power, so buying levels is P2W. As I said it doesn't effect end-game, but that doesn't change it to some cosmetic upgrade you buy from item shop.</div></div><hr />

Getting a toon boosted to 90 is not P2W. What the hell do you win? Do you really think the guy coming back to the game that quit mid-TBC is going to want to slog through all the content just to get to the stuff that is actually current? 90 levels of questing and such can be quite daunting. <br />
<br />
People don't level because they are largely bored of it. Not because they &quot;have to deal with CRZ shit&quot;.<br />

Do you really think that levelling is what makes you a good player in the first place ? If so, you really didn't do any levelling recently. <br />
It doesn't give you any hint of how you should play your character. <br />
Plus, you can't even imagine how many players go through 1-90 using 2-3 skills and not even caring to check their new skills from time to time. <br />
And they are right to do so, seeing how easy it is now.<br />
However, introducing some kind of DK starting zone, kinda &quot;forcing&quot; you to learn how to use your spells, or at least take a look at them, this might be good after all. <br />

If you RAF, then sure. Leveling is quick. But if you don't use RAF, leveling is slow and tedious, and you might just want that extra alt to farm herbs for your main, etc. <br />
It's not gamebreaking. <br />
It's not &quot;Pay to win&quot;, as you're not getting level 100. It's 90. It puts you next to the others.<br />
It's beneficial for the people who don't have time to level alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Hopefully if you pre-order a boxed CE (like from Gamestop or something) It'll have a code on the receipt that you can give to Blizz for your free 90.<br />
<br />
2) Buying a free 90 I think is good. I've got a handful of 90's and want more and I am bored of leveling (especially through BC &amp; Wrath content) but want to try other classes. I think they should be more than a mount ($25) but less than $50. I'm thinking $35 is a decent price. I'm paying for the time it would take me to level. <br />
<br />
3) I hope they do the closed Beta for WOW differently than they did for Hearthstone. By this I mean don't give it to all of the Twitch, Podcasters &amp; such and then a number of &quot;normal&quot; people, and slowly hand out more betas to the &quot;normal&quot; folks. I stopped listening to podcasts because they became so much about Hearthstone (a game I wasn't able to play at the time) that I just stopped listening. <br />
<br />
I'll probably get either a Priest or a Pally with my free 90. Something that can do multiple roles (probably heal + dps). With the new gearing system, not having to collect 2 sets is a great bonus, and I've already got DK, Monk, Druid, and am working on Shammy (also have rogue, mage &amp; hunter).</div></div><hr />

It's always the people that believe they should be special, and since they put time into leveling up a character, others should have to as well. Deal with the fact that life isn't fair.

<br />
If you look at my account I am about to have 16 level 90 characters... working towards having 22 characters.. 11 from each faction, covering one of each race. This is my goal before WoD. I've been working on leveling all these toons since Vanilla WoW. I've spend hundred and hundreds of dollars with race and faction changes to get my toons on the sames servers and factions. When I get all 11 classes on both Horde and Alliance this will be a great accomplishment that people may find rather impressive for the amount of time that was involved. <br />
<br />
However, come the near future as you say... someone with a big pocket book can purchase and achieve what has take me YEARS to accomplish. This to me is a huge sell out, and just another way for the company to make a quick buck. Not to mention a HUGE kick in my private parts. Even if they were $100+ per level 90 character I am still against this feature being added. <br />

What is this post from? BlizzCon 2006? The Burning Crusade was actually the expansion that pitted players against the biggest and baddest enemies in Warcraft history:<br />
<br />
Kil'jaeden<br />
Archimonde<br />
Magtheradon<br />
Illidan<br />
Kael'thas<br />
Lady Vashj<br />
<br />
And if that wasn't enough, Wrath of the Lich King pretty much cleaned up any remaining &quot;big bads&quot; in WoW history: Arthas, Anub'arak, Kel'thuzad<br />
<br />
They're referring to Warcraft 1-2 &quot;big bads&quot; while as so far we've cleaned up Warcraft 3 &quot;big bads.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Why buy power leveling from a 3rd party group?<br />
<br />
There is no reason - Just buy it from blizzard.<br />
<br />
I wonder just how big the cash shop will be this expansion along with having to pay a sub?</div></div><hr />

I get that. But those &quot;big bads&quot; weren't galactic threats like the WC3 ones. From a lore perspective, they pale in comparison. That's what I'm disappointed with. It's almost like we're going backwards in the context of lore difficulty. Each expansion introduces new villains that aren't quite as powerful (in lore) as the previous expansion.<br />

I really dislike the buying 90s thing. Not enough to cry over it necessarily, but I still dislike it. The one free one for everybody was fine, but I'd no longer be impressed (for lack of a better word) with people that have a full account or one of each class, since I won't know whether they worked their ass off for it or just dropped a couple hundred bucks. I know you'd still be able to do it anyway by purchasing multiple licenses and paying for multiple character transfers, but ... meh. I just don't like it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know that this is true. Resources are power. A level 90 is, if nothing else, a resource. They're able to make the most of amount of money running around in the world, whether you're raiding (with more 90s you have more lockouts to burn), farming, running dailies or whatever. There could also be a hit to the economy. You going to keep buying gems or shoulder or gear enchants? Or are you going to drop a few dollars and spend a few minutes to get yourself a level 90 jewelcrafter, scribe and enchanter? (And yes, I know you have to spend time and money leveling the professions too, but if your character is at level 90 then leveling the professions to max is nothing but a speed bump.)</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I think @Talonkaine has a point. I have 15 90s myself. Do I think I'm a special snowflake? No. Do I care whether or not you (or anyone else) is impressed with my feat? No. But like Talonkaine I've worked my ass off to get those characters to 90 and level their professions (and work their freaking farms every day LOL) and it belittles the personal sense of accomplishment when you suddenly change course and let people drop a few dollars to get the same level. <br />
<br />
To throw in some George Costanza ... &quot;it's not you it's me&quot;. I don't give a fig if you have 15 90s too. It doesn't hurt my feelings or make me a lesser player. It's just nice to know that if you DO you probably worked for it just as hard as I did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand the feeling that it may belittle the 'accomplishment' of others that have spent time to actually level their characters, but when it comes down to it, it's not that big of a deal. Like others have said, how does someone else using the power-up personally affect your own gameplay? I've got lots of alts but am nowhere near the cap (which is like, what, 50?). Sometimes I might make a toon to level, sometimes I play my main to crush and dominate, sometimes I play a different toon that's leveled to run around and quest/raid/whatnot, sometimes I might want to pet battle or go brawl. There's plenty of options and, I feel sure that more options are coming.<br />
<br />
Those who powerup to 90 don't affect me. The way I see it, they're missing out on fun times, not me. And, if you're not enjoying what you're doing, then why in the world are you playing the game? Huh?</div></div><hr />

It's not the time you put into playing with your char but how much skill and, yes, intelligence you have. If you want to play a class right you might inform yourself before creating that class. Many don't, they one-shot nearly everything due to heirlooms, so I don't think insta-90's will hurt the game. There maybe even more skilled players in the game afterwards because some don't want to spend their time lvling countless alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please, no. You are missing the entire point of an RPG; progression, immersion, being two key factors. Not actually playing the game, and paying for an e-peen does not exactly qualify as either of these. When it DOES get to that point, what is the point of even playing the game? At that point, you are basically paying to have a digital avatar. Improve gameplay, stahp breaking immersion, stay with real progression. Somewhat off topic, but I actually prefer progressing through multiple raid tiers, instead of progressing through the same raid tier in 4 difficulty levels. Seeing the same content is somewhat meh, and I feel that has been lacking since WotLK. Still enjoy the game though :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have done so many free boosted character events. The problems is I get so many skills, maybe boosted gear, maybe not and no idea where to go or how to play or connection to the gaming community.<br />
<br />
In one game I played I remember thinking I wished I had leveled traditionally cause I knew I would of had a better time learning the game and all the skills.<br />
<br />
Now Blizzard's leveling/dungeon experience is so easy that it happens that you can go 1-90 and not know what you are doing. But at least there is a slow introduction to skills in the leveling process that eases the player into being semi-competent in the tool set and arguably too slow atm.<br />
<br />
If they made the boosts go through a starting zone like DKs with a faster pace of skill introduction but still slowly introducing the tool set of the class, I think the experience of boosts would be much improved.</div></div><hr />

Except they can't drop a few coins to get to the same level. Just think about it, this won't be available until level 100 is standard. What you're doing is the equivalent of bitching about people being able to pay for level 80 or 85 characters with no professions or gear or achievements or quest progress or gold. What does it matter to you at all that someone has a lot of level 85s?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it sounds like Blizzard will allow the boost to 90 for people that pre-purchase the digital copy of WoD early, months before release. So if the per-purchase goes up for sale in the next few weeks, you'll get that free boost to level 90. So lots of new 90's running around MoP at max level.<br />
<br />
I for one can't wait. I am sick to death of leveling up, and I haven't created a fresh level 1, since BC days. I would like to try a Warrior class out, but no way would I waste my time, slogging through 90 levels, which I have zero joy or time to want to do. But I would like to try that class out,a and Raid fairly quickly, after I practiced the class for a few weeks, and first run old Wrath 80 Raids, and 90 Dungeon runs, to get a feel for the character, before I go into LFR SoO.</div></div><hr />

And people said you will never be able to pay for an in game advantage.<br />
<br />
Let me paint you a scenario. I have two young daughters who dabble a bit in the game. They like to run/fly around and just explore. I have the accounts locked down but it's a real pain in the neck that so much of the game is limited to them. I have to level their accounts to get flying, etc. The money I am paying for their accounts and their subs go a small way to making WOW successful. Would I pay for extra 90's for them. Probably not but a free level 90 would go a long way to giving them more to do in the game. It's not going to take anything away from anyone else so I don't see any problems with it. It's not pay to win as I am sure they will get their arses handed to them in PVP by someone 10 levels lower.<br />

The problem is not botting to 90 but the damage that bots cause to the economy.</div></div><hr />
