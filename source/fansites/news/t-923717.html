Patch 4.2 - PTR Build 14299<br />
A new build has been deployed on test realms last night. There wasn't really any important change in this build but it's starting to look like the patch won't be deployed on live realms on June 21st, I don't think Blizzard is crazy enough to push a patch live with a build that is less than a week old on PTRs. <br />
<br />
That would make the patch more likely to be released on June 28th, I'm not sure if it will have any impact on the starting date of the Arena Season at this point. <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.2 - Opening Map / Mails Animation<br />
The feature was shortly implemented on Patch 4.1 test realms and then removed, it's back in patch 4.2! Your character now has an animation whenever you check the world map or open your mail at the mailbox. <br />

Leaders of the Horde and Alliance - Gelbin Mekkatorque<br />
After long years of patiently enduring and biding their time under the hospitality of their dwarven allies, the gnomes have rallied for one final, valiant attempt to reclaim their rightful home. They now face a battle against the twisted genius of a betrayer, one who is maniacally obsessed with ruling over the gnomish race… or destroying it entirely. With their allies hard-pressed to survive in the aftermath of the Cataclysm, the gnomes must rely upon cunning, cleverness, and courage to take back what is theirs.<br />
<br />
Leading this desperate charge is High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque, the brilliant and resourceful inventor who has guided the gnomes through their darkest hours. Now he stands on the razor's edge between personal vengeance and true leadership -- to face a test that none of his calculations could have ever prepared him for.<br />
<br />
Gelbin took a step forward and scanned the room. Maybe if he could get to the other side of the study quick enough, there would be a stool that could become a makeshift weapon. If he could keep the trogg at bay, perhaps he would be able to escape through the opening it had just come through. It would be risky, but it was the best—<br />
<br />
Two more troggs shambled into the light. The first one grunted guttural commands to the other two, and they moved to either side of their prey with a feral swiftness that belied their bulk.<br />
<br />
The wall lowered behind them with a foreboding clang, and Gelbin felt a sad clarity: he was going to die here.<br />
<br />

Quest Design<br />
I'm reading that as you want quests to be interesting but easy and fast to get people to endgame.<br />
Yes and no. When designing quests, it's important for us to keep in mind all the different kinds of players that'll play through them and what their interests might be. For example, some World of Warcraft players just want to get to max level as quickly as they can. That's a totally valid style of play, so we try to make sure that quests don't arbitrarily complicate or impede the leveling process.<br />
<br />
That's just one thing we consider, though. We know that there are a lot of players who absolutely love questing -- quest chains, daily quests, low level quests, all of it. (Loremasters, represent! \o/) And we absolutely want to appeal to that group of players, too. With respect to the OP's suggestions, our concern is that, if we implement quests that are too challenging or too similar to dungeon content, then we risk forcing players into roles and types of gameplay that they may not appreciate. Not everyone likes running dungeons or feeling pressured by having to learn encounter mechanics, so overloading quest content with those kind of scenarios may not be the best course of action.<br />
<br />
Could we do more to vary up the kinds of quests you play through, though? Sure. We feel that we can still provide a streamlined, straightforward questing experience without always relying on the simple &quot;collect this,&quot; &quot;kill that,&quot; &quot;okay, now kill that again, and then be a good sport and collect a variety of gross things from their corpses&quot; objectives that everyone has come to love. Those kinds of quests certainly have their place and will likely remain a staple in World of Warcraft, but we're trying some new things with the 4.2 daily areas that we hope players will enjoy, and want to continue that trend with future content, as well.

Ask the Devs<br />
I'm not going to bother getting into the specifics of what was answered or why or any fansite articles bashing the process; it's been covered many times before.<br />
<br />
But, at the core, I think we agree it's not working. While we could (and do) lament over the reasons why a scheduled Q&amp;A based on question popularity doesn't sit well with people, the bottom line is it can't go on as it is.<br />
<br />
We don't expect people will ever be completely happy with any Q&amp;A. Regardless of how they're conducted we'll never get to every question, so there are always going to be complaints that we didn't answer the right ones. But Ask the Devs is different. While there are certainly arguments that answers didn't say the right things, or didn't give a firm answer on how a problem would be resolved, the process just doesn't work because of the format.<br />
<br />
We've spent a lot of time discussing why it doesn't work, and while that's interesting to us, the bottom line is that once we've finished the role Q&amp;A's with healers, we will be ending the Ask the Dev series.<br />
<br />
Our goal with Ask the Devs was always to increase interaction with the developers, to provide a direct conduit to their thoughts and process. We're in the planning stages for a new Q&amp;A process that will replace Ask the Devs, and while we're absolutely certain people will continue to be upset we didn't answer every question, we think it will overall be a far more successful approach.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..deathknight) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1116-Death-Knight-Cataclysm))<br />
Tanking and Survavibility<br />
DKs have a lot of control over their survivability. While the other tank classes spend a lot of button clicks on generating threat, DKs can regularly hit Death Strike, which heals them. This puts a very powerful tool in the hands of the player. Played well, you can mitigate a lot of incoming damage and even choose when it is important to mitigate that damage. But you also have the possibility of playing poorly. It probably isn’t the kind of play style that is going to appeal to everyone.<br />
<br />
You can look at the recent discussion about the paladin Holy Shield as a microcosm of this debate. Some players wanted more control over their survivability, and the new Holy Shield provides that. But it is more work to control an active button and there is a larger penalty for doing it badly. Death Strike is like Holy Shield on steroids in this regard. There are good and bad times to use Holy Shield. There are definitely good and bad times to use Death Strike. We see some DKs attempting to hit Death Strike as much as they possibly can, and then getting frustrated when they can’t squeeze more Death Strikes into the rotation. What they are perhaps missing is that the timing of when they Death Strike is very important. Used optimally, it’s a powerful reactive tool.<br />
<br />
One thing we have discussed is giving players more control over whether they make this decision (trading higher risk for higher return) or not. In many driving games for example you have the choice of an automatic or manual transmission. Many players choose the automatic, suspecting that they are probably not going to be as fast as a player who is awesome at managing their clutch, but it means they never have to mess with the clutch and can still win plenty of races. On the other hand, imagine that the player who plays the manual perfectly is performing at 100% and the player who performs the manual poorly is performing at 25%. Choosing an automatic transmission for 75% performance may be perfectly acceptable. You give up a little theoretical performance in return for having less going on. Tanking can often have a lot going on. Maybe there is a talent choice that lets DKs have a more powerful Death Strike in return for weaker passive mitigation. Some players would take that talent, and some might only take it for some encounters.<br />
<br />
Related, we understand that some DKs don’t like having to make the decision about whether to Death Strike or whether to apply tanking debuffs. That’s really the tension that’s supposed to be at the heart of any resource system -- I have a limited allotment of X, so at this moment do I want to use X on this one ability or on a separate ability? Again, a possible solution is to put the choice of which play style to use in the hands of the player. We could offer a talent or glyph (or something) that lowers the cooldown of Outbreak for instance, without turning Blood DKs into a spec that can play optimally by pushing nothing but Death Strike. It’s something we’ll consider.<br />
<br />
(Assuming Blood is the manual transmission, and the other three classes are automatic)<br />
<br />
Amazing DKs aren't 25% better than Amazing Paladins/Warriors/Druids, so what is the point of a system that is incredibly punishing and only slightly rewarding?<br />
<br />
The 25%, 75% and 100% percentiles weren’t meant to be taken literally. If a DK feels like he or she has to work much harder than other tanks to achieve about the same amount of survivability, then that feels bad (and to be fair, we had this exact problem with paladin tanks being too easy to play well in the previous expansion). On the other hand, if a DK played well completely trumps all other tanks, then the very best guilds for whom the skill cap isn’t an issue, will just use DK tanks. We see a pretty good spread of DK tanks among both great raiding guilds and all raiding guilds for that matter, so we don’t think the numbers are so far off that groups are either flocking to or avoiding DK tanks.

The map animation was in the 4.1 ptr. It's been around for months. I'm also sure the people who design the animations are the same one who tune your fucking class, too, right?<br />

You mean 4.1, the troll one?<br />
<br />
It was the same exact concept...show events leading up to the dungeons, and then show stuff happening in the dungeons.<br />
<br />
If you're referring to 4.0, as in...Cata release, well that's retarded. That was an ACTUAL CGI produced cinematic, like they did for every other expansion.<br />

Thank you. I play an ENH shaman, and I realize our spec has some significant issues, but seriously, some people just make it the center of their game time how terribly, awfully, seriously weak they are. They forget that there's 9 others, someone's gonna be lowest of the DPS (despite the difference being pretty small) and the loot and valor are the same regardless of what end you're on. If your guild is telling you to sit out content so THEY can succeed, then you have a crappy guild, and should be looking for one where people are more important then content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just so you know, the DPS difference between the highest single target, and the lowest is 47%. What exactly is the point of spending seven months on a new raid, and still have class balance this far apart. Enhancement shaman have always been almost rooted to the bottom of the DPS charts, and I know MANY guilds that will never take one into a raid.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah..so there is a raid and a new faction with dailies and oodles of quests and a legendary and a new tierset (all of which counts as &quot;new playable content&quot; in my book...and map animation (which is a neat touch).<br />
<br />
Let us all just ignore 99% of that and pretend there is no new content and rather pretend patch 4.2 is ONLY about map animation. In fact..I think that is the name I saw on the trailer: &quot;4.2 - Rage of the Haters&quot;<br />

<br />
I don't really care if other people are looking at their maps and i can see them doing it.<br />
<br />
So you didn't get the point, since Archeology is out, a majority of players -who knows the windowed feature- has stopped using the map in fullscreen mode. So basically you will be able to see your own animation.<br />
<br />
Anyway, 4.2 also brings a great feature which is boss capacities' description, and I can't wait to see the moment when 25 players would be told to read this and see those 25 serious student openning their maps reading :)<br />
I hope the animation will vary a bit with time like adding reading with glasses, with monocle, reading with fingers etc :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not 47% in my raids. On an average fight, Highest DPS to lowest DPS the difference is about 25%. Median DPS to lowest is about 15%. We don't use WoL, but at 1/4 the way through heroics, I don't think our abilities can be undermined. We're a good group who tries very hard to succeed, together.<br />
<br />
Again, if you're with people who are telling you that you cannot raid as what you like because of DPS numbers, then please, by all means, find new people to raid with. No spec is so weak in this game that you can't choose to play what you want and succeed. People who insist you change because of your real-or-perceived class issues are either covering for their own inadequacies as players, or using the group to cover another type of inadequacy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well ENH does have some serious balance problems - mostly in scaling. Our secondary stats do a whole lot less for us then most other classes do. We also have the real issue of having two huge caps (Spell hit and expertise) that we get very little help with on gear, being we share gear with Hunters who don't want much hit and no expertise. This tier the itemization sucked too. It sucks seeing hunters get their stat stick and bow off of two of the easiest heroics, knowing you won't be on heroic nef (and the small chance to see your weapon - we've done regular nef almost weekly since Feburary and haven't seen the Axe on reg) for quite a while. <br />
<br />
I'm hopeful that better itemization and better availability of gear (we all ready know we won't have to wait to the end for a weapon this time...) will show that a big part of that supposed 47% gap was our gearing issue, and that the devs will see that and chose to fix some of our statistical short comings during the patch.</div></div><hr />

Actually there is if you are a DPS shaman seeking a new guild. Personally I have had the worst issues trying to get into a guild that has strong potential. Before you say you just suck show me a place in the top 100 guilds that run more than 2 enhancement shaman at a time. Usually you only have one on staff. I know a few dps who had to switch mains because of their lack of dps potential. Enhance doesn't start to show its issues until players start getting heroic geared. Not only that they have one of the worst aoe in the game and very little utility compared to other melee classes (Frost dks have battle rez, kite mechanics/Ferals battle rez, off tanking mechanics/Rets hand spells, emergency heal) and don't say heroism 6 other specs can bring the raid ability.<br />
<br />
Finally to maximize dps as an enhance shaman you will need a spell weapon and will be hardcasting lava burst.</div></div><hr />

As for the trailer. That was pretty awesome.<br />
<br />
Like many of the things in WoW, but a lot of people doesn't even &quot;care&quot; in general. What I love from WoW is it's details and how they take care of EVERYTHING.<br />
I'm starting to get fed up of all the negative comments against the game and how everyone wants only what he really enjoys from the game to be more developed (aka. someone wants more questing, someone wants more end-game raid bosses, someone wants more pvp features, someone wants more pets, someone wants graphic improvements, you know.. they're doing pretty well in all the fields but cannot excel in all of them, learn to enjoy the game in all of its fields and you have the best game ever)<br />
<br />
Also, cool trailer. Huge bosses and lots of fire, should keep me entertained for a while, as I won't be playing during all the summer straight.</div></div><hr />

A couple weeks ago I was thinking of writing a post asking about what happened to the read map animations<br />
<br />
Also that has to be one of the most impressive things I've ever seen. Who thinks the WoW movies should be done like that instead of using actual human people and what not? Or have 2 versions of the movie, one in human mode for the casuals and one in wow mode for the hardcores!</div></div><hr />

I may have misunderstood, or missed something lore-wise along the way, but what was she calling Thrall? It didn't sound like &quot;Thrall&quot;. Go'an or something?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfie of Medivh</div><div class="date">2011-06-16, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually there is if you are a DPS shaman seeking a new guild. Personally I have had the worst issues trying to get into a guild that has strong potential. Before you say you just suck show me a place in the top 100 guilds that run more than 2 enhancement shaman at a time. Usually you only have one on staff. I know a few dps who had to switch mains because of their lack of dps potential. Enhance doesn't start to show its issues until players start getting heroic geared. Not only that they have one of the worst aoe in the game and very little utility compared to other melee classes (Frost dks have battle rez, kite mechanics/Ferals battle rez, off tanking mechanics/Rets hand spells, emergency heal) and don't say heroism 6 other specs can bring the raid ability.<br />
<br />
Finally to maximize dps as an enhance shaman you will need a spell weapon and will be hardcasting lava burst.<br />
<br />
See, you're part of the problem. 1) you take a theoretical best and try to apply it to the game. Spell Power weapons and hardcasting are theoretically better. In the process of play, AGL weapons and using your abilities does.<br />
<br />
2) Why in the world would you bring two ENH shaman? Now I play 10 man - my guild's been 10 man since we were formed, but even in 25 man, you wouldn't want to bring more then one. Personally, I wouldn't want to bring more then one of anything. I'd only do that if I could. If your guild stacks one kind of player because of FOTM then you have a bad guild.<br />
<br />
3) While 6 other specs can cast Hero, 6 other specs also interrupt their whole rotation to do cast it. We don't. We can cast in a second and be completely in the flow. <br />
<br />
4) You didn't mention our best role: Interrupter. - Not just because we have a 5 second CD, ranged interrupt, but because we can do it without breaking our DPS stride. Since, if you're not an idiot who slavishly follows DPS charts, you're using AGL weapons and not doing any hard casting, you can interrupt at any moment and not be in something. Warriors, Rogues, Pallies, they have to be in Melee. Other shamans and MM Hunters have to stop their hard casts. We are truly the best at that, and given the number of fights (Maloriak and Halfus being the prime examples, but Cho'gall and Omnitron are there too) in this tier where interrupting was prime, if you couldn't find a spot, then you probably were not very good at this really vital task.<br />
<br />
5) Again, if you're a good player, a good raider, your DPS shouldn't be the primary concern of a raid group. Your primary concern should be do those bosses taste dirt. If they do, then who cares who's first and who's 12th on the charts? The answer is people with tiny, tiny epeens who need serious help.<br />
<br />
You're right our scaling issues don't start till Heroic, and you're right that our weakest point is our AoE. However, I'd suggest that our AOE problems are much less important then we worry about. Our two AoE fights this tier were Halfus and Maloriak. Huh, ya know, those are the two fights where we can focus on interrupts. You'd think they thought this stuff out, eh?<br />
<br />
Our problems are not as big as our contributions. We are flexible with buffs, we provide solid damage, we are the best interrupters and we bring fast, efficient heroism. Combine all that with the fact we're not sharing gear with anyone but the hunter, and I think we come out ahead of the game. We need work, but it's not the shatstorm you and the whiners on the Official Shaman boards make it out to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go'el. It was the name Durotan and Draka would have given him if they had been alive long enough to give him a proper naming ceremony. Thrall is the name Blackmoore gave him. We find the name out during the way-too-cool THrall questline in Nagrand. I'm not sure if the line is still there or not, sadly. <br />
<br />
Aggra, Thrall's shaman partner, only knew him by that name, and thinks it's disrespectful he call himself after a term of subservience (THrall means Slave in Warcraft speak). She insists on calling him by his proper name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But there is only one way. The word is a direct borrow - there's never been another way to say it <br />
<br />
Personally, I'm just calling it a way to get under Thrall's skin. Like how US republicans call the other major political party the &quot;Democrat Party&quot; rather then &quot;Democratic Party&quot; - it's not technically wrong, but it's just demaning. Rags has the emphasis on the &quot;Man&quot; part in a mocking tone - like how republicans put the emphasis on the &quot;rat&quot; sound.</div></div><hr />

Our two AoE fights this tier were Halfus and Maloriak. Huh, ya know, those are the two fights where we can focus on interrupts. You'd think they thought this stuff out, eh?<br />
<br />
Our problems are not as big as our contributions. We are flexible with buffs, we provide solid damage, we are the best interrupters and we bring fast, efficient heroism. Combine all that with the fact we're not sharing gear with anyone but the hunter, and I think we come out ahead of the game. We need work, but it's not the shatstorm you and the whiners on the Official Shaman boards make it out to be.<br />
<br />
Again I do agree with some of your responses but then I disagree:<br />
<br />
1). While I am not as strict as Min/Max as other people there is a level of where you need to be at. For example if its your possible best set-up why would you not be using such tools at your disposal. Sure agility weapons are out there but its like a Frost Dk using a 2 hander or a Fury Warrior that doesnt use the best possible set up for DPS (1/2 Hander build). You can do that but your doing a dis-service to your potential.<br />
<br />
2). DPS shine more in 10 man than they do 25s. Also my point was that you do see raid stacking in 25 man guilds. Why? Due to the fact that make the kill quicker or bring strong utility.<br />
<br />
3). Point is you still share that ability. Once the ability is used your lockout from using it. Therefore if the mage uses it you lose your more efficient heroism.<br />
<br />
4). I orginially did have the role of the interuptor in my post, but I guess I accidently edited it out. Yeah we bring a good interupt, but so do most other classes, especially tanks/melee have some sort of kick mechanic. Sure it makes a fight like Halfus easier, but its possible to have two rogues to do the same thing. In 25 man Nef you can have tanks and healers interupt too. Does having a dps shaman make the communitication easier, sure, does it trivialize the event, nope. Now we can look like a fight such as Heroic Twin Dragons, having two sub rogues trivializes the encounter. <br />
<br />
On a side note how many bosses require an interupt mechanic in Firelands? While I love the concept of interups I have a feeling the community wants such mechanics to be reduced in the future and its starting to show.<br />
<br />
5). Unless you are progression and hitting the enrage, yes dps does matter. This isnt a best of the best arguement where you stack feral druids or afflicition locks, there is still an issue about enrage mechanics. If your the weakest dps consistently guess what (I am talking about people of equal skill who know how to use their rotation/cds/priorities efficiently without fail).<br />
<br />
While Sinestra was a gimmick fight its still the &quot;prestige&quot; fight of the previous tier. <br />
<br />
This isn't a FOTM issue. I have played as a dps shaman for years. My guild just recently disbanded and let me ask you this. Why is every guild I am applying to asking me to resubmit my application as a different class? I show a strong interview but they don't want my class. Why? Because they don't bring good utility to a 25 compared to their lack of dps potential or totems they bring (every class in some way can bring the same buffs an Enhance shaman brings). If I am getting this message from Top 150 guilds then there must be a trend is there not?</div></div><hr />

On the trailer, it just didn't blow my skirt up. Yeah, sure, it's cool that Aggra took some cough drops since the last time we heard her speak, and Raggy looked great (especially since he was saying more than &quot;by fire be purged!&quot; or &quot;two spoons, Executus!&quot;, but it still doesn't hold a candle to any of the trailers for Black Temple, Zul'Aman, Sunwell, or Ulduar. (Thrall's starting to act like another Mary Sue is what kills it, generally speaking.)<br />
<br />
Oh, and Thrall's model looked decent, except for one bit: his fingers (0:18). Look at them; those things are so far apart you could drive Yankee Stadium between them! Not even Sargeras himself has that much space between his fingers! lol</div></div><hr />

You do realise its takes months to make a 3d movie, it uses soo much polygons!<br />
But i agree ofc that 3d &gt; ingame engine.<br />
Unless blizz had already firelands raid done when cata came , they probly could of done 3d movie. but i doubt that..<br />
there is also the option that they knew making 3d cinametic costs a lot of money wich they rather put in there new mmo Titan.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc7f082fdd70</div><div class="date">2011-06-16, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See, you're part of the problem. 1) you take a theoretical best and try to apply it to the game. Spell Power weapons and hardcasting are theoretically better. In the process of play, AGL weapons and using your abilities does.<br />
<br />
2) Why in the world would you bring two ENH shaman? Now I play 10 man - my guild's been 10 man since we were formed, but even in 25 man, you wouldn't want to bring more then one. Personally, I wouldn't want to bring more then one of anything. I'd only do that if I could. If your guild stacks one kind of player because of FOTM then you have a bad guild.<br />
<br />
3) While 6 other specs can cast Hero, 6 other specs also interrupt their whole rotation to do cast it. We don't. We can cast in a second and be completely in the flow. <br />
<br />
4) You didn't mention our best role: Interrupter. - Not just because we have a 5 second CD, ranged interrupt, but because we can do it without breaking our DPS stride. Since, if you're not an idiot who slavishly follows DPS charts, you're using AGL weapons and not doing any hard casting, you can interrupt at any moment and not be in something. Warriors, Rogues, Pallies, they have to be in Melee. Other shamans and MM Hunters have to stop their hard casts. We are truly the best at that, and given the number of fights (Maloriak and Halfus being the prime examples, but Cho'gall and Omnitron are there too) in this tier where interrupting was prime, if you couldn't find a spot, then you probably were not very good at this really vital task.<br />
<br />
5) Again, if you're a good player, a good raider, your DPS shouldn't be the primary concern of a raid group. Your primary concern should be do those bosses taste dirt. If they do, then who cares who's first and who's 12th on the charts? The answer is people with tiny, tiny epeens who need serious help.<br />
<br />
You're right our scaling issues don't start till Heroic, and you're right that our weakest point is our AoE. However, I'd suggest that our AOE problems are much less important then we worry about. Our two AoE fights this tier were Halfus and Maloriak. Huh, ya know, those are the two fights where we can focus on interrupts. You'd think they thought this stuff out, eh?<br />
<br />
Our problems are not as big as our contributions. We are flexible with buffs, we provide solid damage, we are the best interrupters and we bring fast, efficient heroism. Combine all that with the fact we're not sharing gear with anyone but the hunter, and I think we come out ahead of the game. We need work, but it's not the shatstorm you and the whiners on the Official Shaman boards make it out to be.<br />
<br />
2: I guess you are missing the point: if the player is good, he/she should be taken, no matter what the class is. This is the philosophy that Blizzard is trying to promote. So why wouldn’t you bring 2 ENH shaman if they are good players? <br />
There is a good reason why they are less wanted now for something else than their interrupting abilities: most of their other abilities are being done by other classes, and those other classes bring also more DPS to the tables these days, by far. In the better guilds, taking more than 1 shaman (that is mostly only there for those interrupts) is a loss, because as soon as the interrupting has been taken care of, there is not a single reason anymore to bring a shaman to the DPS table. Oh and not every guild brings down bosses so easily that DPS doesn’t matter anymore. If you can bring a mage who does (let’s say) 25% more damage, then why on earth do you get the shaman in? It can make the difference between a kill and a wipe.</div></div><hr />

Well, If I use my map, I use it rather big, so that I can at least see what is on it.<br />
As soon as your map takes up more that half your screen, you cannot see that animation anymore, so good attempt trying to make other people look like a retard. <br />
Although the animation is nice, the concerns about such thing taking priority over other things that are way more needed, is not taken out of thin air...</div></div><hr />

I show a strong interview but they don't want my class. Why? Because they don't bring good utility to a 25 compared to their lack of dps potential or totems they bring (every class in some way can bring the same buffs an Enhance shaman brings). If I am getting this message from Top 150 guilds then there must be a trend is there not?<br />
<br />
You're applying to the wrong kind of guild then. You get a guild of minmaxers, of course they're not going to take a non-FOTM DPS class. Try finding some people who aare good, whom you like, and build something.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, 4.2 also brings a great feature which is boss capacities' description, and I can't wait to see the moment when 25 players would be told to read this and see those 25 serious student openning their maps reading :)<br />
I hope the animation will vary a bit with time like adding reading with glasses, with monocle, reading with fingers etc :)<br />

Cool enough trailer, but I feel like the storyline for Cata is more disjointed than ever - I guess we can say the elements are wrecking havoc, but what does any of it have to do with Deathwing/Twilight/whatever?<br />
<br />
Have you not read any of the quest or out of game lore or anything pertaining to deathwing this expansion? They are all working together. Together as in the opposite of disjointed.</div></div><hr />

Easier said than done...everyone went their separate ways, I am on a bad server and there is no such thing for pugging on most servers now. 10s take a balance of certain classes/abilties and without those you will never get a 13/13 or in this case 7/7 team together. That is why FOTM is so prevelant is because if you want to play you have to play certain classes if not your like me and just running around Stormwind with nothing to do.</div></div><hr />

Holy sparks, Batmon! Crazy, fire tunnel induced visions!<br />
How appropriate they show Hordies going to save him, lol<br />

Zomg, not Nordrassil! Man, I just spent six months fixing that place up<br />
Heh, &quot;son of Durotan&quot;<br />
Sartharion says RUN AWAY LITTLE GIRL, RUN AWAY to the Fire Wave. Thrall was hit by the Fire Wave. Thrall has wiped Azeroth.<br />
Oh, hey, Aggra was sitting there this whole time?<br />
Jaina sense tingling, &quot;Goddamnit, Aggra, get off him!&quot;<br />

Ok, commentary is over, lol. Map animations, though pointless, are a nice touch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normally when Blizz do this, they push patches back for a tactical reason. Something like a new patch or content for another game. Lets see ...... RIFT patch 1.3 is on the 22nd of this month. That is the reason why we won't see it next week.<br />
<br />
isnt it a good thing to &quot;delay&quot; the patch a week if some unexpected issues come up(what ever they are)?, as far as i know june 21 was never a official release date anyway, it was mmo-champ that announced that it &quot;might&quot; go live on june 21 since one of the ptr builds was marked as &quot;release&quot;, but in a later build it was back to &quot;test&quot; again.<br />

Same here sometimes. The story is fine, the development of the characters is fine. Its the negative crap of a worn out community griping at the smallest of details. <br />
<br />
I mean god sake people asking 'Who's Go'el?' Didn't any of you pay any attention to any of the lore in previous expansions, Thrall IS Go'el, its his birth name. But then I guess lore's overrated to tards only playing to grind the same marks and points on a daily basis ¬.¬</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, I'll bust out my calculator mid-fight, punch in the damage I'm taking from all sources, and then base that on when I hit my DS button.Oh wait, that's ridiculous, and there's no official way to note when you should hit it. There's Bloodshield Tracker, but even that is at the mercy of latency, and isn't 100% accurate.<br />
<br />
It's a cool idea in concept, but there really is a HUGE difference in having abilities that mitigate damage automatically, and using DS 'correctly' without any real tools to do so.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, 4.2 trailer released? Wasn't 4.1 out like the day after the Zandalar trailer? My money is still on this week, what with all the JP-VP conversion blog updates from Blizz, and this trailer now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone's overreacting, methinks (butthurt, possibly... &quot;don't you DARE speak ill of Thrall!&quot; :rolleyes:)<br />
<br />
There's only one place in the entire game where Thrall is ever referred to as Go'el, and that's at the conclusion of that 50+ quest chain in Nagrand. With how Blizzard completely decimated/raped/evaporated the leveling curve in Outland, are you seriously expecting every new player to complete that chain, let alone even know that Nagrand exists?? /facepalm<br />
<br />
Oh, and a point grind is exactly what this game has become (no wonder bosses only drop 6 possible items these days.. everything else is on vendors, bought with points ¬_¬). Thank Blizzard for that one. The &quot;lore,&quot; as disjointed as it is right now, currently serves as nothing more than just a bridge to 'moar pointz'; so disappointing...</div></div><hr />

Ignorance is touching a hot stove despite an indicator light you didn't bother to check or 5 people standing around talking about how the stove is hot but you choose to ignore them/ don't consider to ask them.

I lol'd. There are plenty of fights that are infinitely easier on 10 (and have been since day 1). Is it even? No. Probably 60/40 with the 60 weighing in on 25's being more forgiving, but it's nowhere near the blowout you're making it to be. That and the feel of killing a boss with 25 people is just better then 10, hell I still miss 40 man raids.</div></div><hr />

No doubt. No interest in fighting a recicled/retconned boss because they cant come with new ones. He was cool and new in 2005, now its just a filler for this wanna be xpac. If anything they should be ashamed of making a trailer of this crap. And they wonder why people wont buy their comics or books anymore, if they dont care about the story, why should we?</div></div><hr />

The trailer was decent. I've never had much interest in Thrall, and this certainly doesn't change that, but I always like to see some monologing from bosses that I won't have to sit through before each encounter.<br />
<br />
Oh, and that Q&amp;A response regarding questing was utter nonsense. Questing is mindlessly easy, and their response is that leveling entirely for speed and entirely without thought is a &quot;valid&quot; playstyle, and the real solution is to offer more insipid bombing runs and vehicle quests that are just as mindless and easy as the gathering/hunting junk they want to leave behind? It sounds like leveling content only matters to them so far as they can load it with pop culture references and developer in-jokes; never mind giving players the slightest taste of what the game is really like when you run out of levels to chase.</div></div><hr />

Most definitely a new voice actress, and more importantly, why was she &quot;prettied up&quot; so much? I like the orcish ladies breaking the norm and looking a little rough and less traditionally feminine, but look at the differences to her face in the clip--widened her nose, softened up all the lines of her face, glossed up her eyes. Almost as disappointing as when the new Jaina model came out caked in ten pounds of make up.</div></div><hr />

Or as most of the people I raid with are working on getting ready for progression rather than lore.<br />

Easier said than done...everyone went their separate ways, I am on a bad server and there is no such thing for pugging on most servers now. 10s take a balance of certain classes/abilties and without those you will never get a 13/13 or in this case 7/7 team together. That is why FOTM is so prevelant is because if you want to play you have to play certain classes if not your like me and just running around Stormwind with nothing to do.<br />
<br />
We do this with mains all the time for progression, while doing firelands it is obivous that it is alot easier on heals and dps from range so we are gearing melee with range alts for progression. Why would you take a non-favorable class and gear them up over a class that will greatly outdps them? Who doesnt have alts geared the hell out now 7 months into progression in case you need to switch? We did the same thing having our dps warrior go back to tank again knowing that UH and Frost are going to do alot more dps while pushing progression.<br />

Again I do agree with some of your responses but then I disagree:<br />
<br />
1). While I am not as strict as Min/Max as other people there is a level of where you need to be at. For example if its your possible best set-up why would you not be using such tools at your disposal. Sure agility weapons are out there but its like a Frost Dk using a 2 hander or a Fury Warrior that doesnt use the best possible set up for DPS (1/2 Hander build). You can do that but your doing a dis-service to your potential.<br />
<br />
2). DPS shine more in 10 man than they do 25s. Also my point was that you do see raid stacking in 25 man guilds. Why? Due to the fact that make the kill quicker or bring strong utility.<br />
<br />
3). Point is you still share that ability. Once the ability is used your lockout from using it. Therefore if the mage uses it you lose your more efficient heroism.<br />
<br />
4). I orginially did have the role of the interuptor in my post, but I guess I accidently edited it out. Yeah we bring a good interupt, but so do most other classes, especially tanks/melee have some sort of kick mechanic. Sure it makes a fight like Halfus easier, but its possible to have two rogues to do the same thing. In 25 man Nef you can have tanks and healers interupt too. Does having a dps shaman make the communitication easier, sure, does it trivialize the event, nope. Now we can look like a fight such as Heroic Twin Dragons, having two sub rogues trivializes the encounter. <br />
<br />
On a side note how many bosses require an interupt mechanic in Firelands? While I love the concept of interups I have a feeling the community wants such mechanics to be reduced in the future and its starting to show.<br />
<br />
5). Unless you are progression and hitting the enrage, yes dps does matter. This isnt a best of the best arguement where you stack feral druids or afflicition locks, there is still an issue about enrage mechanics. If your the weakest dps consistently guess what (I am talking about people of equal skill who know how to use their rotation/cds/priorities efficiently without fail).<br />
<br />
While Sinestra was a gimmick fight its still the &quot;prestige&quot; fight of the previous tier. <br />
<br />
This isn't a FOTM issue. I have played as a dps shaman for years. My guild just recently disbanded and let me ask you this. Why is every guild I am applying to asking me to resubmit my application as a different class? I show a strong interview but they don't want my class. Why? Because they don't bring good utility to a 25 compared to their lack of dps potential or totems they bring (every class in some way can bring the same buffs an Enhance shaman brings). If I am getting this message from Top 150 guilds then there must be a trend is there not?<br />
<br />
I got to laugh at the person you replied to saying that the only people caring about dps are the people worried about their epeens. You are a dps class and if you are 4-5k behind the top dps why give a enh shaman gear over a hunter who will do 4-5k dps over you? A guild that isnt worried about progression possibly or a casual guild most likely but any guild like a Top 150 is going to put the mini/max classes in, thats the idea of a good raid leader putting the best tanks,healers and dps in the raid for the fastest progression.<br />

Thank you. I play an ENH shaman, and I realize our spec has some significant issues, but seriously, some people just make it the center of their game time how terribly, awfully, seriously weak they are. They forget that there's 9 others, someone's gonna be lowest of the DPS (despite the difference being pretty small) and the loot and valor are the same regardless of what end you're on. If your guild is telling you to sit out content so THEY can succeed, then you have a crappy guild, and should be looking for one where people are more important then content.<br />
<br />
In Other words forget progression guilds or you can join a casual guild that thinks they are pushing progression lol. It is the raid leaders job to put the best team in the raid,highest tps,hps and dps and putting someone whose a GOOD guy over a better player is a bad raid leader who wont see any real progression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's been a danger for all this time, but it worsened due to the Cataclysm. It was self contained before that. Deathwing ripped a hole between Deepholm and Azeroth, with the hole being at the Maelstrom to worsen the effects.<br />
<br />
While at that point in time the world pillar has been restored and most of the danger there is gone, it is still a heavy focal point for the elements with there being at least three of the four present visibly, not sure on fire, so is a good spot to try and contact the elemental spirits for Thrall. Though the life element he seems to be forgetting, then again so does wow entirely except for some crafting stuff.</div></div><hr />
