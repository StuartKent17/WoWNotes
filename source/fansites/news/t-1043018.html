As a part of the on-going evaluation of Looking For Raid and the loot system, we have recently implemented a change to the Looking For Raid Need Plus system. Weapons, trinkets, rings, neck pieces, shields, offhand items, and the Robe of Glowing Stone are now class-restricted to their intended users. With the speed at which a Raid Finder group moves through a zone, we’ve found that it makes it challenging for players to evaluate loot decisions – by class restricting these items, we hope that the natural behavior will have a more positive set of results for everyone involved. This change will not apply to normal or heroic raid or dungeon loot rules.<br />
<br />
Raid Finder and Need Plus are both very new systems, and we’re working to iterate on these systems rapidly to ensure that everyone has the best possible experience as we learn more about how players are using the system. Please keep in mind that this system is not considered complete and we have further plans to improve upon it within Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
If you looted an item from Looking for Raid which replaced another and you need Game Master assistance to recover your old item, please place a petition with the new item name, that you can no longer use it - and the old item name you need restored. For more information on the affected items, please visit the Customer Support forums here- http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3729953854#1<br />
<br />
We apologize for the inconvenience. <br />

I agree, all hunter loot. Now I can't complete my BiS set because I can't roll on spirit cloth. Boo.<br />

In all seriousness, though, I'm glad they made this change, didn't really see anything funky like strength swords going to mages myself but then again I've only done a few runs.</div></div><hr />

right now souldrinker is just about BiS for frost Dk's casue the damn sword procs...A LOT. so the proc does about 10% of a frost dk's total dmg. blizz was kind of smart on this, they combined a dps and a tanking sword into one item. does it suck for a tank wanting this? sure does but it also sucks to loose out to a tank for this sword as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not just the armor. It's the &quot;aesthetic&quot;, i.e the LOOK your character has overall.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Grab the shield, and leave the off-hand items for those it's meant for.</div></div><hr />

I've been following MMO-Champion for a year now, but never actually made an account untill now, just to comment on this post.<br />
Nevertheless, this is not the point of my reply, my reply is below;<br />
<br />
You're completely correct in regards to this. By giving the loot roll bonus to people in off-spec is most certainly unfair, and will result in an unjust enrichment. That happened to me last week in the Fall of Deathwing LFR. The two-handed sword dropped off Deathwing, and a Protection Warrior needed it; which he later gave to his Blood Death Knight friend, even though the Death Knight lost the roll. My point being here, supporting yours; is that the loot roll bonus should be fixed, so that people currently in off-spec, cannot exploit the system.<br />
<br />
I opened a ticket about this matter; and the answer I got was that a team at Blizzard was doing everything to improve the LFR system, and its looting rules. They did not answer on my question directly, but rather gave the previously mentioned answer.<br />
<br />
This broken mechanic beats the whole purpose of doing the LFR raids, when a group of people can team up, need on a certain item; and then give it to his/her friend. Hopefully this will get fixed soon. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Healing off-hand classes that are not shaman / paladin: Cannot use shields<br />
Healing shields: only usable by paladins / shamans<br />
<br />
Ergo the shield is yours, and keep your grubby paws off my offhand :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even with Expertise it's an upgrade over 378 rings until they get something better. Plus Expertise can be reforged to something more useful. Should they need on it? Not if there is somewhere there who would benefit but if not an upgrade is an upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Note:<br />
<br />
Souldrinker is BiS for Frost DKs for each tier of DS difficulty. <br />
<br />
It's odd, i know, but this confirms, our BiS Frost is Souldrinker. Nice to have that there :)<br />
<br />
And btw, the proc DAMAGES for 1.3% of our HP AND heals for x2 that amount. So it's also a dps boost.<br />
<br />
And before any tanks get their underwear in a knot: think about it. Currently 1H Swords/Maces get itemized with parry/dodge and are used by a whopping 2 (yes two!) specs in alllll of WoW. By adding Frost DKs and (possibly, not sure about this one) SMFury Warriors to the mix it's still only 4 specs! Compare that with say, oh I dunno, a Int Staff that how many specs would roll on? <br />
<br />
It's smart. They already fail at making good looking gear (c'mon Souldrinker looks very similar to a 2H ICC Sword!) so to ask them to make one for ever spec is lol</div></div><hr />

Is it considered as tanking weapon or dps weapon? Because honestly draining hp is more for tanks, BUT last week some dps won the roll WITH role bonus in LFR. <br />
I am confused, any ideas?<br />
<br />
Unless you're an Orc and get the racial bonus wielding Hand of Morchok, wielding Souldrinkers will be BiS for Frost Death Knights and I believe SMF Warrior's (may be incorrect about SMF, feel free to correct). The proc rate on the drain has been proved to be a greater DPS gain than the static stats. In this case the weapon is versatile and is useful to both roles.<br />
<br />
(Quote in regards to Paladin's being excluded in the off-hand class restrictions.)<br />
<br />
Why? The shield is better anyway lol<br />
<br />
The shield may be better, but that doesn't mean it can't be an upgrade in the mean time until you see the shield drop. Personally, I see no reason why Paladin's shouldn't be allowed to equip an off-hand item.</div></div><hr />

Nevertheless, this is not the point of my reply, my reply is below;<br />
<br />
You're completely correct in regards to this. By giving the loot roll bonus to people in off-spec is most certainly unfair, and will result in an unjust enrichment. That happened to me last week in the Fall of Deathwing LFR. The two-handed sword dropped off Deathwing, and a Protection Warrior needed it; which he later gave to his Blood Death Knight friend, even though the Death Knight lost the roll. My point being here, supporting yours; is that the loot roll bonus should be fixed, so that people currently in off-spec, cannot exploit the system.<br />
<br />
I opened a ticket about this matter; and the answer I got was that a team at Blizzard was doing everything to improve the LFR system, and its looting rules. They did not answer on my question directly, but rather gave the previously mentioned answer.<br />
<br />
This broken mechanic beats the whole purpose of doing the LFR raids, when a group of people can team up, need on a certain item; and then give it to his/her friend. Hopefully this will get fixed soon. :)<br />
<br />
Look on the bright side. One thing to remember is that even if the DK had a &quot;better&quot; chance of winning the roll because his warrior friend was willing to help him out, it didn't make your chance to win the roll any less likely. You still have a 1/X chance to win the roll regardless of how many people &quot;team up&quot;.<br />
<br />
I know it's not much, but it's better than nothing. At the very least, Blizz is demonstrating their willingness to apply a partial, &quot;band-aid&quot; fix until a more robust rolling system can be deployed in 5.0.</div></div><hr />

This is a band-aid until they can get something better working.... They have said many times that they cannot determine your spec as of right now. It seems like it shouldn't be that difficult but apparently it is, hopefully soon they will be able to patch it up and do something based on spec, but for now this is a huge step in the correct direction.

Did you read the post at all? The item restriction change is to make double-damn sure people don't get loot they shouldn't be able to roll on over the class that should use it. Souldrinker is a tank weapon despite dps having been able to roll on it with the bonus. Blizzard was just late to the game in getting these restrictions live, considering I've lost three Souldrinkers on two tanks, two to rogues and one to a death knight.<br />

Actually if you look at the stats on the off hand and the shield you get more intellect from the off hand then you do from the shield... ie the offhand would be better for PVE. I do agree the Shields are better if you are doing PVP but we are talking about PVE right now.</div></div><hr />

I think a lot of LFR raiders don't know and don't bother if an item is usable for their spec. They sometimes don't even know what their spec is for. They see that they can roll on an item - and they roll on it.</div></div><hr />

Probably has to do with the fact that if it`s your main spec, you roll need and get a bonus over people who roll greed, as off spec. Calling that unfair is as good as saying someone`s terrible off spec &gt; some great geared persons main spec that`s a big upgrade.<br />

Is it considered as tanking weapon or dps weapon? Because honestly draining hp is more for tanks, BUT last week some dps won the roll WITH role bonus in LFR. <br />
I am confused, any ideas?<br />
<br />
Yeap. It is both for tanks and dps. Because there is the damage bonus to it makes it viable to frost dks and Fury one hand builds. If the dps was rogue, he just gained some gold instead...<br />
<br />
But no, it's not a pure dps/tank weapon.</div></div><hr />

It's one step closer. At least DK/Warriors/Paladins can't steal the Agility axe and vice versa for rogues/hunters taking the Strength sword. I'm sure next they will implement bonus rolls only for specific specs on specific items. Hopefully soon, but I can live with this for now.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter now nor did it matter when 4.3 hit. Dual wielding provides no benefit to hunters and is actually a dps loss due to enchants and stat scaling between 1h and 2h.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard was just late to the game in getting these restrictions live, considering I've lost three Souldrinkers on two tanks, two to rogues and one to a death knight.<br />
<br />
These restrictions should have been in place before 4.3 even went live, and should be applied to LFD.<br />

Souldrinker is BiS for death knights, so don't complain about losing to one. The rogue complaint is valid, and has now been addressed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually that's not true- hunter pets inherit expertise proprotional to hunter hit. When a hunter is hit capped, their pet is expertise capped (at least from the back of the target). I'm not actually sure if pets even inherit experitse from hunter gear directly- it's not something I've tested but I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard never put it in- they don't get dodge from gear hunters wear for example.<br />
<br />
The only reason that the heroic ring is BIS for hunters is just the fact that agility is so powerful that even though 60% of the expertise of the ring is wasted (since you can reforge the other 40%) you still come out ahead relative to the 397 valor ring.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's quite easy to answer, actually. If your primary raiding is in LFR, you generally will not have access to the normal or heroic versions of the instance and be unable to actually do the rogue legendary quests (and requisite precursor Hagara). Additionally, different specs of rogues require different main hand weapons (only assassination and subtlety rogues use main hand daggers - combat uses axes/swords/maces).<br />
<br />
Actually, the only thing you need to do to get the 397 daggers from the legendary quest is to find someone with a Hagara instance that'll let you come in and pickpocket, pay 10k, and do the questline. So even most LFR rogues who are actually serious about playing rogues will probably be wearing them after they realize that, although some won't want to spend the 10k (10k for a pair of weapons of that quality is a steal though).<br />
<br />
Also, the daggers have a special equip bonus which makes them suitable even for combat rogues.<br />
<br />
Due to the way the legendary questline is setup, it does seem like a waste everytime an agil dagger drops, but I suppose some folks in LFR will still need them. I can't imagine the normal level instance daggers will get much use though.</div></div><hr />

I think you've made a pretty good case for finding a new guild. OT, can stuff you need in LFR be traded or does it become soulbound like items in 5-mans? And if it does become soulbound can you still trade it with others that were in for the kill for the next 2 hrs?</div></div><hr />

Honestly, if you want to gear your OS, that's fine, but you should be in there for the roll you want the gear for.<br />
It just absolutely sucks when you're on your 39th run of H Deadmines, and when your helm finally drops for the first time, the tank Needs on it. And this was back at the start of Cata, when Deadmines could literally take 4 hours, and you could go through 10 people trying to pass it...<br />

Having to ask 24 random strangers in LFR if it's ok if you need on all the healing gear just isn't a good idea.</div></div><hr />

I don't give a flying **** about LFR loot because there is other alternatives at same ilevel, but its a problem when we start talking BiS items. Then the hunters can ONLY get one ring from Heroic mode that is of any use and are forced to use the Valor one as second = 410+397 rings, where feral/enhance/rogue can use 2x410<br />

As if we weren't far enough behind already when it comes to BiS gear due to our terrible scaling, this just makes it even worse. GJ !</div></div><hr />

I don't give a flying **** about LFR loot because there is other alternatives at same ilevel, but its a problem when we start talking BiS items. Then the hunters can ONLY get one ring from Heroic mode that is of any use and are forced to use the Valor one as second = 410+397 rings, where feral/enhance/rogue can use 2x410<br />

As I commented earlier, off-spec doesn't really mean what it used to back when we didn't have the dual-spec system. So I suppose we agree to disagree on that point. :) <br />
<br />
<br />
It just absolutely sucks when you're on your 39th run of H Deadmines, and when your helm finally drops for the first time, the tank Needs on it. And this was back at the start of Cata, when Deadmines could literally take 4 hours, and you could go through 10 people trying to pass it...<br />
Well hopefully the tank would be considerate of others' needs. If not, yes, I can understand the frustration it would cause on the DPS' end.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having to ask 24 random strangers in LFR if it's ok if you need on all the healing gear just isn't a good idea.<br />
That, I do agree on. I believe that was another one of my reasons for opposing the creation of the LFR tool because while meeting up with four other random players can work out most of the time, I was and still am very skeptical about that holding true for raids. Despite all what I just typed, though, I probably will end up utilizing the LFR simply out of necessity. :/<br />
<br />
Best of luck to us all.</div></div><hr />

That's not the main issue here, the issue is people (hardcore raiders included) will need stuff just because they can. If people only rolled on gear they need, we would only need one type of roll. The issue is people have no standards and no respect for other players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What a nice way to put it lol. Loot equipmentally challenged must the new pc way to say, fucking retards.<br />
<br />
I'll admit that was one of the things that stuck out the most in their news release for these changes.<br />
<br />
If people really don't know what they can and cannot get benefit from by now at level 85, I honestly don't have much patience for them. I've had Rogues rolling Need on tanking rings in heroics recently, (WoE 2nd boss ring; STR/STA/Dodge/Parry [ish]) and then had to explain why this was not a good item for Rogues. They then said they wouldnt take it, as they already had it. DPS warrior won it instead over me; the tank.<br />
<br />
While the mechanic is useful, for how LFR tends to go; people don't read tactics, DPS get impatient VERY fast and essentially become the &quot;go guy&quot; from WoWCrendor's vid, sometimes even ninja pulling (which I prompty let the boss eat before actually tanking, as in LFR missing 1 DPS isn't noticeable), all this despite some people not knowing the tactics, some not even knowing about the dungeon journal which gives you the information, (New BH boss came out, I looked at the 3 abilities and realised the tank/dps positions, stack/split timing and the ever present tank-taunt effect very quickly), yet earlier tonight tanking FoD: Ultraxion; the OT doesn't taunt off me when I get Fading Light, cue some DPS deaths, he then doesn't use HW when he gets FL; cue at least 4 deaths on his part in that fight alone (Wiped once, explained next). This habit of not taunting when needed got me killed at least 2 times in that run, once on Madness, once Lewtship, yet despite having been told he needed to taunt (both before - so they needed to be ready for it - and during the fight - so they knew when to taunt), they failed at this very easy role, resulting in at least 1 wipe on Ultraxion. Sadly, as I had already run the raid this week, (was helping some guildes by tanking for them), the aweful tank was rewarded with his bad playing with tanking boots, a trinket and some other items as I couldn't roll on them. Now given the faults by this tank were entirely playstyle and not based on the gear they had, getting those upgrades will do absolutely nothing to their survivability, or that of the raid.<br />
<br />
Raid ended as usual, everyone rolled on everything they could at Madness. Warrior gets the AGI dagger, Ti'tahk went to a lock which was fair enough - minus the several wipes they almost caused and I can't remember what happened to Souldrinker and the other item, given I had no chance at them.<br />
<br />
PS: I managed to come up with way too many words here and yet currently trying to write a thesis which has the complete opposite problem. &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Blizzard finally attempts to sort the situation.<br />
<br />
People cry because of lack of taking loot they SHOULDN'T BE TAKING. Cry me a damn river about offhand for a paladin. I had to level one up in god damn cloth, leather, mail and plate because blizzard couldn't be assed to itemize my plate right or give me options to get better. I was denied MH upgrades and shield upgrades. I hated running around with offhands. I didn't roll a Paladin to be a priest. If I wanted 1h with offhand, I'd have rolled a damn priest. Which by the way, were getting upgrades left and right from caster cloth to staves. STAVES that would have been useful for me! If I could use them.<br />
<br />
I rolled Holydin to carry a shield and a 1h. Not a weapon and [Deformed Eyeball clutched by Withered Claw on a Stick]/ &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can still get the trinket at normal level, this only applies to LFR. I expect the reason they didn't just adjust the rolebonus for the items is that it's more technically complex to do in their system and would require recoding, whereas the roll system already knows how to filter by class limitations on an item. I don't think it's ideal, but I understand why they went this route since they needed a quick fix.</div></div><hr />

People will need stuff because of greed and stupidity just as much as people will need because its an up. <br />
<br />
I like how some people state, well pallies/shammy use shields get over it, with the offhand issue. This would be coming from either a priest or a mage that I bet if a mace or sword had dropped that had Int (without Hit etc) and a pally won it, would be rope-able if they were told get over it, you can use daggers. Its hit and miss guys. Loot is random, people take what they need, but just remember when you sign up for Looking For Retards, that's what you might get.<br />
<br />
For that most part, people have their 10/25mans and use LFR for fillers/Alts. If you don't like a random bunch of people get into an organised guild group and do 10 or 25's, hell, get 8/15 organised people into a LFR if you cant raid regular, and then if your not willing to do that, then you just have to deal with it (the loot issues that is) until a better system comes along. <br />

If they want this to be a proper part of the progression cycle, spec AND role-based restrictions are pretty much features that should have been done before it went out the door, not in the next expac.<br />

Souldrinker is a tank weapon despite dps having been able to roll on it with the bonus. Blizzard was just late to the game in getting these restrictions live, considering I've lost three Souldrinkers on two tanks, two to rogues and one to a death knight.<br />
<br />
These restrictions should have been in place before 4.3 even went live, and should be applied to LFD.<br />

Did you read ? If you look its class specific to Dk, Pally, and Warriors. No Do is going to tank with it. So as a dps Dk we will get a roll bonus on it just how it is.</div></div><hr />

Ledger of Revolting Rituals (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78441/ledger-of-revolting-rituals/) is better than Timepiece of the Bronze Flight (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78458/timepiece-of-the-bronze-flight/), simply because of that red socket and its bonus. Taking that into account as well as the +40 int enchant for both, the off-hand gives 310 intellect versus the shield's 280. So that's a difference of 30 intellect, unless you choose to use the JC-only version in which case the difference would be even greater. Yeah, I want the off-hand for my shaman since the loss of 14 haste rating and 8 spirit doesn't mean anything.<br />
<br />
Edit: For purposes of clarification, I did not assume use of the epic +50 int gem since its not very prevalent. I used the rare +40 int gem for the math.<br />
<br />
UPDATE: I've been informed that the shield has been hot-fixed. It now offers a gem socket (with some slight adjustments in the stats) and so the off-hand is no longer desired.</div></div><hr />

Also the drops are randomised in the bag, so you get something for your class, but it could be something you already won. The point is you get something guaranteed to salvage for credits etc. In WoW mostly all you get is jipped (as in get sweet F all).</div></div><hr />

Just as you might get loot in your bag that you already have in SWToR, your VP/JP can be spent on something you may want, if you dont need anything you can buy crafting mats etc. I'm not having a go at ya, just stating you still are rewarded its not as black and white as you make out :)</div></div><hr />

Too bad. That's the way the cookie crumbles. You get the shield, we get the offhand. We've gotten the short end of the stick before with your shields, and now it's your turn.<br />
<br />
I would also like to point out that using the JC gem doesn't change anything, because you can only use 3 of them regardless of where you put them. So whether you have the offhand's socket or not, you're still getting the same extra int from those 3 gems.</div></div><hr />

I t would be ok i guess if I had a chance to still have loot chances if I could go again and roll on gear, but as soon we killed one boss that boss cant be looted again that week... We are 17 dps in a LFR and most of us roll on same gear, just look 5 classes can use same in rdps and 3 classes in tank classes, even rogue have a piece purely for him. Less people for a role get most there , while those most needed (17) get way lower loot chances... Well just my thoughts from my wiev :)</div></div><hr />

This is a very bad idea since people may want to gear off specs, and guaranteed drops break the game.<br />

I get the feeling that Blizzard can never make people happy. All the QQ for fixing a minor problem. It makes me laugh. Blizzard didn't have to do this. If you have problems with people ninjaing gear, vote kick them, or start a raid team. Crying because you aren't getting your gear as fast as you want is funny. I applaud Blizz for addressing the issue.</div></div><hr />

Then a 2h sword drops in LFR. Shouldn't u be allowed to have an equal chance to win it as others who can use it? Same thing could be said about ferals rolling for balance-gear or elemental shamans rolling for agility gear - perhaps you are not playing your mainspec in the LFR-grp.How the expertise-ring from Hagara can be flagged for hunters however is just weird.</div></div><hr />

Same here being a hunter myself I still don't see why we can roll on that ring since it has expertise &gt;_&gt;<br />

<br />
Interesting to know. Up to now I had assumed all dps wanting this would be ninja'ing. Seems I was wrong (and sad, due to having more concurrence on my tank weapon). But it's only Frost DK DPS, right? No other dps should want it?</div></div><hr />

I don't dispute it is smart, despite raiding with a tank character. It is just - something unexpected. I think most tanks who lost a role on this weapon did not know this and think they lost to a clueless/greedy person ;-)</div></div><hr />

OS rolls are perfectly fine since:<br />
1. you can equip it<br />
2. you can use it<br />
3. you benefit from it (stat wise)<br />
4. Blizzard allows<br />
<br />
And remember: your loot rules &lt; Blizzard's loot rules. Don't like it? Make your own raid, set yourself as Masterlooter. Problem solved, you can play loot god. And one more thing - loot distribution is based on class, not spec/role. Deal with it.<br />
<br />
Back to OT: I approve. Two weeks ppl were QQing about Hunters having tanking trinks, DKs getting agi polearms, Warriors needing on bow. No moar. This move will cause less drama and we all get higher chances for proper drop became ours, finally.</div></div><hr />

The shaman was correct. The offhand is far better than the shield:<br />
Offhand has +30 Int when gemmed and -8 Spirit (Int is far better than Spirit). <br />
<br />
I agree that shamans should prefer shields, but if blizzards penalizes it they would be stupid to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See, that just seems mean. <br />
<br />
But here is what I find interesting about your argument:<br />
<br />
People that complain about not having adequate gear choices are annoying. This hunter is complaining about gear choices. Hunters are annoying. I mean, priests have even less choices.<br />
<br />
Which would imply...<br />
<br />
But about the statement on priests and their gear upgradeability:<br />
<br />
Robes of Dying Light - Chest - 410<br />
Woundlicker Cover - Back - 410<br />
Splinterfoot Sandals - Feet - 410<br />
Signet of Suturing - Ring - 410<br />
Ring of the Riven - Ring - 410<br />
Gloves of Dying Light - Hands - 410<br />
Cowl of Dying Light - Head - 410<br />
Legwraps of Dying Light - Legs - 410<br />
Visage of the Destroyer - Staff - 410<br />
Mantle of Dying Light - Shoulders - 410<br />
Heart of Unliving - Trinker - 416<br />
Reflection of the Light - 410<br />
Vesta's Irrepressible Girdle - Waist - 410<br />
Bracers of the Black Dream - Wrist - 410<br />
Scintillating Rods - Wand - 410<br />
<br />
This seems like more than half. I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
But on the earlier statement about Hunters not having two high level rings... you're incorrect. Signet of Grasping Mouths. A second choice that does not have expertise.<br />
<br />
I hope the two of you weren't using item level 384 loot from LFR as the sole basis of your argument for their being not upgrade options beyond 397.</div></div><hr />

One thing to remember is that even if the DK had a &quot;better&quot; chance of winning the roll because his warrior friend was willing to help him out, it didn't make your chance to win the roll any less likely. You still have a 1/X chance to win the roll regardless of how many people &quot;team up&quot;.<br />
<br />
I know it's not much, but it's better than nothing. At the very least, Blizz is demonstrating their willingness to apply a partial, &quot;band-aid&quot; fix until a more robust rolling system can be deployed in 5.0.<br />
<br />
Completely false. If the warrior were to be locked out of the role bonus because he was there as a tank then your odds go from 1/x to 1/(x-1). If there had been a bigger &quot;team&quot; of tanks/healers then the odds you win improve even more.</div></div><hr />

I suppose it's better than it was but it seems like a swing from not-far-enough to too-far.</div></div><hr />

With 3 red sockets and that socket bonus + reforging, that is a STUPID huge upgrade for a mage or warlock over ANY 378 gear. Plus, all 3 classes are gonna place it with tier eventually, I'd assume, so it's silly that it's limited to one class.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, this should solve the problem as much as is possible at the moment. I'm sure they'll add the &quot;highest attribute&quot; thing, OR have people queue as &quot;Int DPS&quot; or &quot;Agi DPS&quot; in LFR in mists, but I believe them when they say this is impossible or too difficult at the moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, DK's shouldn't be allowed to roll for their BiS gear because Warriors and Paladin's can use it and decided it's a tanking weapon. Thanks for the update pal!<br />
<br />
Here is ranking for ya incase your too lazy to click link of frost DK weapons,<br />
1-Souldrink Heroic<br />
2-Hand of Marchok Heroic<br />
3-Souldrink Normal<br />
4-Hand of Marchok Normal<br />
5-Souldrinker Raid Finder<br />
6-Nokaled-Heroic<br />
<br />
Also, people keep QQing regarding it being a tank weapon, you can make the arguement that it is 1-handed therefore was designed for frost DK's.</div></div><hr />

Thats the downside to this shitfest that we call LFR. I as a warlock have no option to roll on anything else, these f'n &quot;hybrid&quot; classes can do whatever the fuck they want.</div></div><hr />

i agree unfortunatly i can only hope so they ajust it for spec be4 mop and 4.3 was ment to be the test for this</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durandro</div><div class="date">2011-12-15, 01:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Undoubtably they did this because of the huge influx of tickets made because of classes rolling need on items they can't even make proper use out of, and the system still gave them a role bonus.<br />
<br />
I had a copy-paste reply from a GM yesterday which annoyed me so much because it was obviously my ticket hasn't been read (as I never mentioned ninja looting, only pointing out the problem in the system and suggesting passing on feedback to the devs) that I wrote another ticket in complaint about the lack of effort made on the GM's part to even address my concern. Anal, perhaps, but my goodness I can't stand that sort of 'customer support'.<br />
<br />
Especially when most GM's are great, its a shock to the system when one is rubbish.<br />
<br />
Just wish this change had been made sooner.<br />

It's not just the armor. It's the &quot;aesthetic&quot;, i.e the LOOK your character has overall.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Grab the shield, and leave the off-hand items for those it's meant for.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard wants me to use a shield instead of an offhand, they need to make the stats better. Honestly, why would I want to lose out on 30 intellect (40 if I gem with an epic) for a small amount of secondary stats and some armour? I'll take the offhand the moment I can get it on normal, thanks.<br />

sooooo hunters can no longer DW an AP Agility axe, gg blizz, tho i guess im mists it wont mater anyway<br />
<br />
An agility axe with a MELEE PROC.<br />
<br />
If you're using that, then you're a scrub. Plain and simple.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Warrior/Paladin tanks? Stop complaining that Frost DK's and SMF Warriors roll need on Souldrinker. Its their BiS too, and they have few enough options as it is.</div></div><hr />
