Armory Stats - Character Item Level Distribution<br />
Today we are taking a look at the item level distribution of Level 90 characters. There are 5.5 million characters and 2 million accounts that were active after November 1, 2013 that make up this sample. Main character is defined as the highest item level character on an account. The All Characters category has been scaled down to 37% of its true value to be easier to compare to Main Characters.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
I'm so sad you are leaving. However unbalanced things are,I must thank you for making my paladin viable after TBC's horror.<br />
Things are pretty balanced. It's fine for players to like BC class design, but it wasn't balance they liked. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406137436805144577))<br />
things are not balanced at all what even<br />
They are balanced enough. You can play any spec and progress meaningfully in PvE or PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406158042409861120))<br />
it's true but you have to walk a fine line between balanced and unique I felt classes lost a lot of unique sadly<br />
We do too, and that's one of the advantages of a larger mythic raid size. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406154094898737152))<br />
The alternative was some specs were just never going to get brought to a group, esp. a 10 player raid. Maybe would be better? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406140124494172160))<br />
<br />
I know correlation isn't causation, but when came in, Frost was relegated to PvP, and as he leaves it's strong in PvE.<br />
It was a philosophy change. Early on some specs were intended for PvP or PvE. I have no real objections to that model either. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406877883127173120))<br />
<br />
I never understood after dual spec was added why you guys didn't stop trying to balance pve and pvp and just have a pvp spec<br />
Some Frost mages and Sub rogues want to PvE with that spec. Not saying that's the best design, but that was the motivation. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406955240831737856))<br />
<br />
I thought it was added because bosses were winding up with some needing 2 heal and some needing 3.<br />
Dual spec was added because at the time, tanks and healers were terrible solo. That is less true today. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407210217852526593))<br />
<br />
Is it possible for stacked CDs give diminishing returns, so that stacking CDs has higher burst, but lower dps? Unintuitive?<br />
That is one solution. Another is just shared cooldowns. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407210343304151040))<br />
<br />
Real question, so don't laugh. You think they will ever let hunters/locks gear pets, example collars with stats ?<br />
Would there be sufficient gameplay there though? Wouldn't you just stack haste or int or your best stat? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407312844208631808))<br />
<br />
Making some classes deliberately subpar was not a great thing, but some old mechanics were better<br />
We're always happy to discuss old mechanics that you miss. I don't think it's e.g. short term blessings or Shadowbolt spam. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407619689490030592))<br />
<br />
Why is this argument acceptable for some things and unacceptable for others? The issue of ability bloat, for instance.<br />
Well for example, we changed talents and lost some players who preferred the old model. Same would be true of a large spell purge. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406878519247900672))<br />
Yes, but, in theory if the change was actually better for the game you'd recoup any subscriber losses with gains, correct?<br />
Theoretically. But hard to argue that cutting 20% of abilities (for example) would directly lead to many new or returning players. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407623728881627136))<br />

Mana was never a issue and MoP hunter model was the worst yet. I think the LK/Cata hunter was much more fun<br />
I prefer the MoP hunter, but obviously it's subjective. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405082274560888832))<br />

I made a twitter account just to ask one question: do you not see a problem btwn Holy vs Disc. HPriest here.<br />
Disc is too versatile, esp. in 10s, and Atonement is too good at healing for no real mana cost. I've said that for awhile. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/405885976557268992))<br />
<br />
Dear Greg.. buddy... from Hpriest to another Hpriest, let's do something about our mana regen<br />
I think it feels about right TBH. Mistweavers and Disc can get away with too little regen. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407619857421578240))<br />
<br />
g/f keeps telling me holy is terribad compared to disc. what makes you stick to holy? ps. armory link?<br />
Holy is fine. CoH and Divine Hymn can do things that Disc can't. I would agree Disc is too versatile, esp. in 10s. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407925931177562112))<br />

not sure this is your dept but why are rogue combo points still unique to the target and not the rogue like pally holy power<br />
Target switching was always seen as a skill test for the rogue. You can argue it's archaic, but that was the design. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406153939050958849))<br />
<br />
UI / Addons<br />
along with millions of others, thanks! One if the best game additions ever.<br />
Transmog needs a better UI and collection mechanic, but it will get one eventually. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/406155140945559553))<br />
<br />
Have you considered making &quot;fire&quot; in raids easier to see like static neon circles/boxes where it would/is happening?<br />
Putting too many UI elements right in the world takes away from the world itself. It can look ugly. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407312282108960768))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Any plans in WoD for improving the endgame for people who don't like organized raiding?<br />
It's something we discuss a lot but coming up with something fun and challenging has proven difficult. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407314719767134209))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Currently its raid or die.. while there is a lot more the game should be about. Low level content was abandoned too early<br />
You mean like someone would go play a new level 40 dungeon? Or that leveling should be slower and less focused on finishing? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407619260165267457))<br />
<br />
Have Blizzard ever thought about releasing a sequel to an expansion? Like 'Wrath of the Lich King 2' ?<br />
It's always a balance between revisiting things players remember fondly and avoiding that rehashed feeling. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408752674620715008))<br />

This. A million times this. It also didn't count the people with recurring charges on their cards that haven't logged in in months to inflate the numbers. The numbers are off folks. Anyone with a brain knows it. WoW is so far from 7 million real &quot;subs&quot; that it's not even funny. That's like the government saying the unemployment level is at 7% when anyone with a brain can easily read the real number of almost 10%.</div></div><hr />

Just realize, that it's &quot;2 million accounts&quot; that have level 90 toons that got played between Nov 1, 2013, and whenever the sample was taken.<br />
<br />
So that's 2 million active accounts with active level 90 toons that played in the last 5 weeks.<br />
<br />
I haven't played my 90s in over 3 months. My account is still active, and I still play, but I wouldn't have been counted in this listing. I'm certain that there's others that are in the same boat.</div></div><hr />

Considering the subscriber statistic is sourced from shareholder-related information, anyone who's paying counts, regardless if they play regularly or not. Blizzard, as a company, wouldn't give a damn if there were zero players, as long as they had those seven million subscriptions raking in money. So, no, it's not an inaccurate measure -- it's just not measuring what you're trying to make it measure.</div></div><hr />

So even a Flex raider with upgraded items, Cloak, plus some luck from the Celestials and Ordos would put him/her at 560+ item level easily.</div></div><hr />

I'm at 561 and only 10/14 Normal ... I suspect that spike represents the 'wall' at the end of normal raiding.<br />

It's a lazy problem. Those numbers better be new players and alts, by the way. I stopped playing right after the release of MV, came back right after 5.2 hit, got my green fire, started the legendary quest and got it to the point of nearly having my cloak, obtained a 519 ilvl, and made 100k gold in a three month span.

Nope. There is no alts only category, and...<br />

The All Characters category has been scaled down to 37% of its true value to be easier to compare to Main Characters.</div></div><hr />

Come now, dev team. That's just silly.<br />

I've long held that rogues should be able to target swap on the fly--their combo points should represent combat momentum, and part of a rogue is agile, keen awareness of the fight. Look at, for example, how Batman functions in the Arkham Asylum series. He can battle multiple foes effectively because he can quickly change focus without losing any momentum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 581, there are 2 mains with that, and a 1 value of all. This means that with the downscale to 37% of it's original value, that makes 3 total.<br />
Okay, cool, nothing too outrageous about that. Or is there? This means that there are 2 characters at that level which are the top of their account, which takes 2 or the 3 spots available in the all category, leaving 1 character at that ilvl that is not the top of his/her account. The only reasonable explanation for this (apart from obviously not 100% reliable data, but that's no fun) is one guy/gal has 2 characters at 581.

Thought #2. Why even bother using real numbers on the y-axis then going through the effort of finding the exact amount of downscaling to do to make the graph look right?

Seems much easier to me, and therefore each will be correctly scaled with each-other.<br />

<br />
For real? They added LFR precisely for that genre of player, who wanted more endgame content. And in the process created the WORST feature I've experienced in the game. Absolutely terrible. People walking into raids with no knowledge, idea of their class and abilities nor the bosses, and expect to be carried and handed loot.<br />
<br />
I wish they would go back to the way things used to be. You got max level, you went to raid, or in later additions, you went and PVP'd. Maybe you enjoyed dungeons, maybe you made gold.<br />
<br />
If none of it appealed to you, you stopped playing the game and went to something else.<br />
<br />
Blizzard need to stop morphing the game to cater to everyone, and put resources into what made the game grea,t and that was endgame raiding. They need to stop catering for every level and everyone. If people arn't willing to organise a raid, put the hours in, or even research a boss, they shouldnt be raiding, end off.</div></div><hr />

The 2 vs 3 thing is just rounding. 2 * 0.37 = 0.74, which rounds up to 1. <br />

<br />
I've known for a while that I play wow basically because I like its lore. The game itself is outdated. However, WoW lore is always more appealing to me than other games' lore, so I keep playing to see what is going to happen next.<br />
<br />
That being sad, I am a more PVE oriented person and I kinda like the idea of LFR allowing me to see the lore. Problem is, the way it works (a bunch of unknows rushing to get loot) just isn't the best way to experience lore. First, because while characters are speaking, tanks are mobbing everything and you basically have no option but leave the talking NPC behind (or stay behind to listen and forget about your group which is not very polite to others). In organized raids people usually stop to experience the lore they unlocked and it is easier to ask for some seconds to read/watch lore than in a LFR where people will just ignore you (or call you retarded or something). Second, because seeing the story after a LFR makes it feel a lot less rewarding than normal raiding.<br />
<br />
So, I kind of agree that going back is beneficial at some points. BC was super rewarding and people, although at very different progression points and having very different item levels (which is not bad), were all progressing and playing at their own pace. Problem was most people got to a wall along the way (25-man content, raid dificulty and attunement quests). So, thinking along, some of the problems in BC are solved by now with flex and cross realm raiding. Others are not, like the attunement quests which are still not very well resolved (forcing people to complete quests and locking raids until they do doesn't seem ok). However, the attunements did help making it a rewarding progression and were able to tell more in-depth lore. We also had more interesting and developed characters by that time, which made everything more epic (Kael, Vashj, Illidan, Akama, Maiev, the Naaru, Draeneis, Blood elfs and some past orc lore). In Pandaria, I don't know... It felt like the lore was too spread, too redundant. The guys that really added something new and significant were Anduin, Taran Zu and Garrosh. And I still don't buy Garrosh and Jaina turning bad... It was a bit too forced.<br />
<br />
So, yes, maybe considering elements from past xpacs is not bad. I really don't know how to fix LFR... it is good until it is bad. But I kinda liked the Wrath of the Lich King model in which raids would become easier as time progressed, so everyone could experience things without them being so easy and annoying like LFR is. Maybe Blizzard should ask players if they would still play LFR if they could get items and lore mailed to them. Is LFR really fun by itself? Or do people just do it because of the easy loot and the lore? I don't know the answer, but it would be a hell of a starting point. Maybe it's fun just for 1 or 2 weeks after release (that is my case!) ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same. The numbers being &quot;low&quot; is due to it being a sample size, and it being post-last raid. This is when most people take a hiatus. <br />
<br />

Remove the levels - no joke. If there are no levels every zone can be used for content. Every zone can have challenges and quests with good rewards. You still need to equip for raids and you could learn your spells when you start your first character in some kind of tutorial that lasts an hour or so. <br />
<br />
There would be waaaay more stuff to do in the world and new players could instantly join the fun. Blizzard gives away a level 90 character soon, but that's only the first step to that because that is what would make all the nice world zones interesting. Right now only mines and herb collectors visit old places. Without levels you could do quests anywhere you want with similar rewards. You could start way more events all over the world and fill the world with treasures to find, valuable for everybody not just someone between level x and y.</div></div><hr />

So any player that has posted an auction or has been in a guild with someone who uses the ah. Sure you won't get everyone but should account for 80%.<br />
Is there a way to get different view of the data like total number of mains under 500 etc so we can get percentiles</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then your characters are not included in this sample.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Pets can be used to find alts, so there is no point in turning that option on if you want to hide your alts. All it does is remove you from our sample data until I get around to also using pets to match alts.</div></div><hr />

also &quot;disc too versatile in 10's&quot;? well its not like we can just have a tank kite adds for 10 garrosh...different formats are different?<br />

<br />
What? I raid 10s and I have seen tons of warforged loot, including the 3 that are currently equipped on myself</div></div><hr />

Warforged still has a 15% higher chance to drop in 25s.</div></div><hr />

I know but it doesn't mean WF does not exist like the OP said, or my guild was just lucky we have seen quite a few of them</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alternategray</div><div class="date">2013-12-09, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The bump in the 56x region doesn't mean there are more Heroic raiders. It simply means most people upgrade their Normal gear which becomes 561, and Ordos gear and Legendary cloak helps to bump the total ilvl up as well.<br />
<br />
So even a Flex raider with upgraded items, Cloak, plus some luck from the Celestials and Ordos would put him/her at 560+ item level easily.<br />
<br />
It would take a little bit more than that, you'd have to have some normal items in there as well; I believe it's impossible to break 560 without doing normal SoO. With 4 559 Ordos pieces, 2 553 tier from celestials, the legendary cloak, and everything else flex (and with all gear upgraded) the ilvl would be 558.<br />
<br />
Edit: nevermind, I was assuming you'd stick with 4-pc tier over Ordos. If someone went balls-to-the-wall Ordos gear, 1 553 tier gloves, legendary cloak and the rest Flex they'd be at 561. Although that's gonna be fairly rare I imagine.<br />
<br />
I agree that you're probably right about the heroic raiding; I'd think the bump is probably people hitting the Normal gear cap. Complete set of upgraded Normal gear plus cloak is 564. Assuming most raiders are missing a piece or two and have a warforged here or there, it works out.</div></div><hr />

That's not the total subscriber count, that's the sample taken for this survey.<br />
<br />
Um. Awkward. You do realize 4-5 million play in china right? So 2-3 million is the actual sub count for the west.</div></div><hr />

Any plans in WoD for improving the endgame for people who don't like organized raiding?<br />
<br />
For real? They added LFR precisely for that genre of player, who wanted more endgame content. And in the process created the WORST feature I've experienced in the game. Absolutely terrible. People walking into raids with no knowledge, idea of their class and abilities nor the bosses, and expect to be carried and handed loot.<br />
<br />
I wish they would go back to the way things used to be. You got max level, you went to raid, or in later additions, you went and PVP'd. Maybe you enjoyed dungeons, maybe you made gold.<br />
<br />
If none of it appealed to you, you stopped playing the game and went to something else.<br />
<br />
Blizzard need to stop morphing the game to cater to everyone, and put resources into what made the game grea,t and that was endgame raiding. They need to stop catering for every level and everyone. If people arn't willing to organise a raid, put the hours in, or even research a boss, they shouldnt be raiding, end off.<br />
<br />
Here, let me help you with your own words: If LFR doesn’t appeal to you, stop doing LFR and go to something else. If people aren’t willing to put up with LFR raiders, put the hours in (for the learning! for the wipes!), they shouldn’t be doing LFR, end off.<br />
<br />
You seem to assume every LFR raider is automatically a clueless moron, which is moronic in itself. Do you wanna tell us anything about the times you tried LFR?<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Don’t like it, don’t do it.<br />
<br />
I for one could care less about the item level race post last raid, so LFR suits me just fine. You can’t assume because of that that I don’t care for playing my class properly or reading up on the encounters beforehand.<br />
<br />
As for “catering to everyone”: like it or not, WoW is a business. With all this talk of it losing subscriptions, do you honestly think it would be logical for Blizzard to try to attract less customers? As the current trend doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, I’ll use your words again: if the game in its current state doesn’t appeal to you, you stop playing the game and go to something else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure where they get their info from, but when you look someone up on wowprogress it tells you what other characters that person has.<br />
<br />
This is how our raid check people out when they say...my main has done such and such</div></div><hr />
