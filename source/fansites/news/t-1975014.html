Legion - Lord Ravencrest Armor Set<br />
Lord Ravencrest (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Kur%27talos_Ravencrest) is the last boss of Black Rook Hold (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/496-Legion-Black-Rook-Hold) and may drop his armor for players.<br />

Stealth bug<br />
What happens: When you are in stealth, or get a re-stealth you will randomly drop stealth. If you have not encountered this issue on Legion or Live, consider your self very lucky. <br />
We're fixing bugs like these daily. Let us know where exactly it's happening so we can reproduce it.<br />
<br />
There was an invisible spell being cast within the arena start that was breaking rogues out of stealth, should be fixed now. Blame Holinka. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/407397-stealth-bug/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742945818?page=1#6))<br />
<br />
RNG in PvP<br />
I'm noticing a ton of dodging going on. It's frustrating as arms to pool up 3x Focused Rage and then just have your CS'd Mortal Strike passively dodged. Are we still planning on playing the whole RNG is okay in PvP game?<br />
It's something we've talked about. Right now the PvP stats are set pretty high which means high dodge, parry etc. We'll likely set them to something that feels good sometime soon. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/407394-rng-in-pvp/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743026351?page=1#4))<br />
<br />
PvP Talents<br />
We plan to have a testing phase where we unlock all Honor talents on characters. Can't say when, but sometime soon. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/407391-talents-as-of-right-now/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742836302?page=1#4))<br />
<br />
Relics<br />
You slot them into your artifact at the forge in your class hall.<br />
You can do so anywhere, like you would gems. Just Shift-Right Click your artifact and drag the relic to the slot you want to fill. We'll look into a UI tutorial the first time you get a relic to make this clearer.<br />
<br />
In general, you will have to go back to your forge to spend Artifact Power, but we would like for as many item rewards as possible to be usable immediately in the field. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/407385-relics/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742986325?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
Random Battlegrounds Queue Time<br />
Battlegrounds simply require a lot of people to have queues pop consistently. Your average battleground requires 10-15 players on each faction and lasts 15 minutes. A skirmish requires 2-3 players from either faction and generally last 1-3 minutes.<br />
<br />
When we transition to beta, we will be disabling skirmishes for a short time to focus our numbers on battlegrounds. We'll then re-enable arenas a few weeks later. But sorry, I can't share when that will be. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/407343-random-bgs/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742806269?page=1#5))<br />

PvE<br />
Snapped at 9:14a, only one I queued for. Again no satchel at conclusion. I'm done. #Warcraft #TheSatchelIsALie <br />
Could you provide the character name that this happened on? I'd love to help track down this nagging issue. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/714854276380499968))<br />
Sure! I was on my shaman.<br />
So, oddly enough, in this case it looks like you queued as Healer/DPS and were slotted as DPS. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/714916903223885824))<br />
We'll look into a better way to handle things in these cases. Meanwhile, queuing for just the satchel role should be reliable. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/714917181557833728))<br />

Sorry, didn't mean to call you out or anything. It's just frustrating with some people on mmo-c that make a big deal about the &quot;censoring&quot; subject. This change just gives those people more &quot;reason&quot; to complain :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the timing of changing the pose came a little too late, if they change it drastically people will forgo their pre-order as Jeff is changing the pose after they have committed. It's like you put down a loan for a house and the person said you don't need that big of a bathroom even though you paid for it and just cut it up to reclaim the land, does it really affect you, not really but is it legal? Of course not cause you not getting what your paying for and allowing people to leave with 100% of their money intact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kaplan's very first response (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20743015583?page=11#210) to the &quot;concerned parent post&quot; was: &quot;We'll replace the pose. We want *everyone* to feel strong and heroic in our community. The last thing we want to do is make someone feel uncomfortable, under-appreciated or misrepresented.<br />
<br />
Apologies and we'll continue to try to do better.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was nothing in the initial reply to that thread as to their intentions on changing it because they already wanted to. The initial reply comes off to a lot of people as basically kowtowing to the OP of the thread, that and the fact that he locked the thread and prevented further discussion on the topic. It's not hard to see why people weren't all too happy. <br />
<br />
It was only after that response that Kaplan made another post going into more detail on how the art team as a whole weren't happy with the pose. (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/overwatch/topic/20743015583?page=11#211) (Take note of the full day between posts)<br />
<br />
The outcry of censorship came before &quot;All they said was &quot;We were going to redo that pose.&quot;...&quot;, not after. It's what prompted the whole &quot;We were going to replace it anyway&quot; post. That 5 seconds of research certainly is a difficult thing.</div></div><hr />

They are making tier sets with all new 3d parts, and then this set that literally looks like something from tbc quality wise. And they really need to stop using this wrestling belt model, it's horrible<br />
<br />
Yea, 100% agree! the belt is the worst.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what the purpose posting this now just after the whole Tracer cencorship fiasco besides to get people riled up.<br />
<br />
Btw, the new Tracer pose is awesome<br />

It's like you put down a loan for a house and the person said you don't need that big of a bathroom even though you paid for it and just cut it up to reclaim the land, does it really affect you, not really but is it legal? Of course not cause you not getting what your paying for and allowing people to leave with 100% of their money intact.<br />
<br />
Your comparison is absolutely ridiculous, you've paid a pre-order to play the game, not to see one pose. The game is in beta and subject to change at any time, while I would agree with you if the game changed from what it is now to say an MMORPG then your comparison would have some merit and hell yeah I'd demand my money back if I didn't like it. Blizzard did great with the new pose anyways, one decent butt pose for an awesome butt pose.</div></div><hr />

You haven't worked in any sort of retail environment at all from that quote. You never know how ridiculous some of the claims were but then you have consumer rights. &quot;What you have paid for should be stated what you have paid for&quot; and to you seem ridiculous but they didn't pay for &quot;The Game Director to change the direction of the game due to one quote on the forum&quot;... Would of been better off not mentioning it but then Jeff wants free publicity and any publicity is good publicity and he's pulled it off spectacularly. <br />
<br />
This event though is drumming up the dwindling pre-orders as it hasn't matched even Destiny or COD levels, people forget that Overwatch isn't going to be compared to the likes of Dirty Bomb or some good Team FPS. Overwatch is from Activison and Blizzard and if I was Bobby kotick, I be keeping an eye on this game and comparing it to COD, Destiny and even TF2 cause it comes from a company that produces triple AAA games with great MMO environments for FPS.</div></div><hr />
