Maybe that's a way Thrall can distinguish himself helping the family back together for a big win. <br />

Think Jaina got green fever going on? I don't want to spoil it, I dont mean this in a marketing way at all. Thrall is meeting a nice girl from Nagrand and gonna have little brown babies. Let's put it to bed. Funny choice of words there.<br />

<br />
they don't exist, they were integrated with the argent dawn into the argent crusade (vanilla quest &quot;in dreams&quot;, which was finally revealed in the lights hope - deathknight starting zone quest).<br />
<br />
You gotta love the american style talking from the devs (rather than pointing at chris specifically) and stuff &quot;Love that shit&quot;, &quot;so badass&quot; ... aww i can imagine the accent, it's kinda cute. I love seeing americans excited, i don't think Europeans can do it as well as them. Possibly why my girlfriend is from WA, rather than my home country of Scotland.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. What were they doing? Was Metzen drunk or something?<br />
<br />
Edit: And they seemed to completely misunderstand the guys question about the Old Gods and took the opportunity to try and make him look foolish. I had enjoyed the event up until this panel which was quite honestly awful to watch.</div></div><hr />

So some guy wrote a story about what happened to KT between the time of Tbc and BlackTemple? Huh?<br />
<br />
During a story competition someone wrote about what happened to KT bewteen TBC and BT. (i'm guessing you know once he died and came back all demony with a crystal through his torso)<br />
<br />
A number of years ago, one of the lead writers covered all of that in a story he wrote, and they're thinking of pushing that out as a novel.</div></div><hr />

If Illidan somehow got redeemed I'd explode in joy, killing him was retarded, and Maiev is a cunt, just sayin.<br />
<br />
Deathwing is also looking to be one of the coolest expansion bosses yet :D<br />
<br />
Don't care much for Thrall becoming superimba but if it has to be anyone at least he's a good fit, I love how Metzen always refers to his characters as if they were real. The whole Thrall questioning himself and who he really is was cool to listen to, and just the way he comes off is why Metzen is one of my favorite writers.</div></div><hr />

if you took the DNA from Peter Molyneux and Clifford Bleszinski then added a lot of drugs. You'd get Chris Metzen ;)<br />
<br />
like i said, i kinda love how they use language (unsuited for a 12+ game lol) and come across all excited like a bunch of schoolkids. I kinda like that enthusiasm, but.. well... shame about the actual Lore of the game. <br />
<br />
The Deathknights argument with the worgen and goblin was just, well, awful. sorry. I mean sure they might have existed but just sticking them in seems lazy. Not as Lazy as avoiding a new brewfest stein. but still pretty lazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An examples:<br />
<br />
I'm a big fan of the Saurfangs but I never knew what kind of clan they're from.<br />
- Metzen: *pauses*<br />
- Metzen: Blackrock?<br />
- You sure?<br />
- Alex: 80%<br />
- Metzen: No, 100%... as of 3 seconds ago.<br />

This was the best panel of the day. Metzen and Afrasiabi were really on fire. They had great banter and really worked with the crowd. They seemed just as excited to be talking about the game as we did to be listening. Some of the questions were a little stale, but the answers were always dead on. <br />
<br />
Maybe the spirit of the sarcasm isn't coming across in text, because it definitely didn't feel like two smug corporate types sitting on high, making fun of us poor little fans. Nothing against any of the other panels (My husband went to the SC2 Cinematics panel and said it was pretty rockin'.) but this one definitely won overall. Very excited to see what else they pull out tomorrow. <br />
<br />
Now if only I could get some damn sleep! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awesome, thrall as the new aspect of earth. I wonder if he will end up becoming a dragon. I hope not.<br />
<br />
Would be kind of cool if he uses his new power to just punish the hell out of the alliance. But he wouldn't, because he is horde. That is something the alliance would do. <br />
<br />
I liked reading this.</div></div><hr />

Is she going to be a major lore figure in this expansion (more than just a cameo appearance in Darkshore?) or not?<br />
<br />
If they're following the same patch format as WotLK - there will be 3 major patches with 3.1 being Firelands, 3.2 possibly being the Old God they mentioned and 3.3 being Deathwing? Where does a CoT raid or Azshara raid fit into that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would've been better if he worded it like &quot;There are more people dpsing than tanking&quot;, because now it kinda sounds like tanks play no part in this game.<br />
<br />
The other guy (Who i don't remember the name) did say 'But it's the most important role'... but it's not in the transcript for some reason.</div></div><hr />

They don't give a rats ass, so this Q&amp;A was totally unnecessary. That and they'r changing lore like mad, just so they can implement some random crap into the game.

you mean 4.1......4.2...4.3..etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it was in reference to the quest chain &quot;the battle for Andorhol.&quot; At the end... well, the question kinda explains what happened at the end.</div></div><hr />

Why would someone ask if we are going to kill Alexstraza?<br />
<br />
I thought Azuregos felt that Kalecgos was too young to be an Aspect??<br />
<br />
Who the fuck is Turalyon and why should I care??<br />
<br />
Need more Kael'thas. With Arthas out of the picture he can get with Jaina, that whore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wickedpissah</div><div class="date">2010-10-25, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, I've seen a lot of people mentioning how snarky and sarcastic this panel was. A couple other people have said this, but it was totally different watching it rather than reading it. The transcript that Bibi gave is NOT complete. It was an amazing panel, and definitely the one I enjoyed the most--I watched it twice (after seeing it myself I realized that my son would love hearing about Thrall becoming the Aspect of Earth). So, please...stop bitching so much. It was great information.<br />
<br />
EDIT--I went through and picked the part that I thought summed up this panel best so I could point out where the awesomeness actually was lost in the transcript.<br />
<br />
Are we going to see another caster legendary weapon that isn't a mace?<br />
- Metzen: What do you want? What would make you happy?<br />
- A big stick.<br />
- Metzen: A Staff, it's coming!<br />
<br />
This guy got up there and asked when a caster DPS legendary was going to be there. They asked him what he wanted and he gave a glib answer, &quot;Something that I can use. I'm a mage, so either a big stick or a dagger.&quot; They then asked him what would make him happy and he said something along the lines of &quot;Something I can use&quot;. They didn't take that for an answer. They stopped him from walking away and said, &quot;I'm serious. What would make you happy?&quot; And that's why the next legendary will be a staff. It was cool.<br />
<br />
There was another example of this...FUCKING WEIRD kid...going up there. He starts talking and I'm like, &quot;OMG.&quot; I wish I could link a youtube video or something. But he pointed out that in The Shattering, Falstad was supposed to be on the Council of Three Hammers, but they had put Kurdran on there instead. Metzen says, &quot;Isn't Falstad dead?&quot; And the kid goes on to say no, he's been leading Aerie Peak, he survived the end of Day of the Dragon, blah blah blah. They were silent for a few seconds, looked at each other and said, &quot;Yeah, you're right. We'll fix it.&quot; It was cool...this bizarre kid goes up and points out their lore mistake and BOOM, it's fixed. Don't say these guys don't care.</div></div><hr />

What is a quire, and why would I preach to it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, you mean the way original slow level 70 flying mounts will be updated to fly @ 310, the same as the most epic of WotLK reward mounts? Explicitly so that people could use their old favorite of the past?<br />
<br />
And the BoA weapons already do scale.<br />
<br />
We knew the answer to this was no. Still, this would not make the top ten thousand dumbest WoW questions.</div></div><hr />

Is it just me or is this the worst BlizzCon yet? The class panel was terrible and this Q&amp;A is so full of cocky assholian answers laced with sarcasm it isn't even funny.<br />
<br />
i totally agree. the developers for some reason acted like total pricks and didn't seem to care about taking the lore or fans seriously. it was just a &quot;yeah, whatever&quot; attitude. i don't know what the hell happened this time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nathanyel</div><div class="date">2010-10-26, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Was this ever different? Panels usually have a lot of redundant or outright dumb questions, the devs way of joking around is their way to deal with it and not go &quot;oh this shit again?&quot; <br />
While you have to handpick truly new info, always remember BlizzCon is not mainly an info event, it's a fan service event. Even if those fans want to ask questions that have been answered oh so many times already.</div></div><hr />
