<br />
Patch 4.3.2 Items<br />
The most significant item change was Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78487/gurthalak-voice-of-the-deeps/) having the proc time increased to 12 seconds from 10 seconds. This change was made to all three versions of the item.<br />
<br />
Many of the original level 60 ranked PvP gear items have had Replica added to the start of their name, making their name identical to the versions being sold in Area 52, for example the Replica High Warlord's Cleaver (http://db.mmo-champion.com/item/77580/#15050/15148). However, they still retain their higher item level and stats.<br />
<br />
Three new items were added in Patch 4.3.2, Feldrake (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79771/feldrake/), Eye of the Legion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79744/eye-of-the-legion/), and Demon Hunter's Aspect (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79769/demon-hunters-aspect/).<br />

Darkmoon Faire Hotfix<br />
A hotfix was deployed last night in order to solve the issue and the monthly quests should now be available again. However, if your character had already encountered a bug with some of the monthly quests, then you will need to wait until the next Darkmoon Faire starting on February 5 in order to complete those quests and the related achievements. <br />
<br />
Once again we apologise for any inconvenience this issue may have caused. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215294-darkmoon-faire-known-issues-updated-04-01/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3161499235?page=1#18))<br />
<br />
Vial of Shadows Ranged Attack Power Bug<br />
Just want to confirm: Vial of Shadows working only with melee attack power and not ranged attack power is indeed a bug. Barring unforeseen complications, this will be fixed in an upcoming hotfix.<br />
<br />
Lock and Load not being caused by Arcane Shot is an intentional change. As many players have pointed out, there is just no need for it any longer. We also intend to make sure Black Arrow is used over Explosive Trap, probably by buffing Black Arrow slightly.<br />
<br />
We are looking a lot at hunter DPS right now. We think it is in a good place when compared to other ranged DPS specs (in equivalent gear), but falls short when compared to ranged DPS with Dragonwrath. The guilds currently posting heroic combat logs have a lot of Dragonwraths, and unfortunately, hunters are the only ranged DPS who don’t have access to a legendary weapon. When more hunters have Deathwing weapons, their DPS will go up compared to the Dragonwrath users who won’t be upgrading their weapons, and we’ll see what hunter performance looks like.<br />
<br />
It’s likely that future legendaries won’t be usable by so many classes and specs. For the present situation, one option is to just buff hunters to make up for their inability to have legendary weapons, but when you look at DPS casters who have no legendary, it's a tough option to take. We’re not sure yet of the future of the attack power buff in Mists of Pandaria, but in the short term we want to make sure that there are some situations where melee can do really high DPS rather than routinely coming in below ranged DPS (which is how we felt about the last two raid tiers).<br />
<br />
If we buff hunters, it will more likely be through other avenues. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215352-vial-of-shadows-bugged-for-hunters/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3821266200?page=5#89))<br />
<br />
Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps Balance Issues<br />
Gurthalak should not proc off of Censure. The bug was with Seal of Truth, so Souldrinker will proc less for paladins as well.<br />
<br />
The specific bug was that paladins running Seal of Truth had two chances with every swing to trigger the proc with Gurthalak or Souldrinker. They now have one chance. <br />
<br />
For other classes, the sword overall does the damage we intend, but it's variable, so a few spectacular numbers are occasionally posted. Those shouldn’t be accepted as typical. Likewise, random burst can sometimes cause high damage in PvP, but we don’t think those situations with Gurthalak are reliable or severe enough to be a balance problem.

Mists of Pandaria Blue Posts<br />
Mists of Pandaria PvP<br />
There will be PvP additions for Mists of Pandaria. We'll have more information/details at a future point in time.<br />
<br />
Just as a quick FYI, here's a link to the BlizzCon article ( http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/blog/3768753/World_of_Warcraft_Preview_Panel_Mists_of_Pandaria-10_21_2011) we posted outlining the panel contents that were covered.<br />
<br />
We'll be sharing more details before much longer on many aspects of the expansion. Don't worry. Just to add on to this, the Developer Q&amp;A (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3825589/Mists_of_Pandaria_Live_Developer_QA_Today-10_27_2011) in October also touched on PvP including world PvP.<br />
<br />
We're quite aware of the desire for more world PvP. We're also aware that there are those who do not want to be &quot;forced&quot; into it either. We have plans that we think will help assuage that &quot;dilemma&quot;. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215342-so-no-pvp-in-mop/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3840666564?page=2#27))<br />
<br />
Watered Down Lore in Mists of Pandaria<br />
We're always open to constructive feedback as long as it stays constructive. There are a few different types of thoughts from the community on these things that I've heard via podcasts or read on fansites and the forums here. <br />
<br />
First, we've gotten lots of feedback through the years that it's difficult to learn the story of World of Warcraft. Many players have expressed that they have concerns over too much story having to be found outside the game and not enough in the game, or even not being led to the story in the game and thus missing it. Obviously, this is something we've been trying to correct where we can and trying to find a balance between the two. We're aware that Azeroth's history and story is pretty vast and with each new expansion, we're given the opportunity to expand on it even more.<br />
<br />
Second, we've heard (as you've stated) that once through, it's not as fun the second time. We've obviously experienced this as well in the past via Culling of Stratholme. As you saw there, we did eventually make it possible to skip this portion of the event, but there are risks involved with that too. For newer players or those that aren't on the front edge of progression, this can cause them to miss out on being able to see this story unless they're with people who are willing to let it play out so they can experience it. <br />
<br />
That said, I can't say that we'll do the same for the current dungeons (allowing the &quot;skip&quot;), but I can say that we'll continue to take constructive feedback on these aspects of the game as often as we can. We want to make sure we're giving the story that people want, while still making sure it's as fun as possible to be a part of it.<br />
<br />
As for Mists of Pandaria and the storyline there, we definitely want to continue down the path of offering up story where we can. We feel that this can only enhance the experience of the game. We're not unaware though of the concerns on both sides of the fence.

Diablo Anniversary Page<br />
The surprise that was hinted at was a nice Retrospective page with lots of screenshots, videos, and interviews involving the Diablo franchise. <br />
<br />
The trailer that was on the page had a few parts that were unreleased so far and they were quickly removed. Luckily our friends over on Diablofans (http://www.diablofans.com/news/1042-diablos-anniversary-south-korea-rating-lashing-tail-kick-runed/) have the video of them for you!<br />

However it currently requires level 20 and Apprentice Riding, which is odd because drakes can't be used as ground mounts. This either means the Feldrake item description is wrong (probable) or that drake (and possibily others!) are going to be usable as ground mounts. I sincerely hopes for the second!</div></div><hr />

I find that hard yet easy to believe. I played Warcraft 2 and the Xpac Tides of Darkness aswell as WC3 and WC3:TFT and I knew 90% of the story. Even with out playing those games however I still found out the story due to quests in WoW. People rush through the quests and don't bother looking at the text at all. In SWTOR(direct comparison inc!) you have the option to skip past the text/speech part of the quests and have the ability to skip past cut scenes but that takes the whole story away from the game too. If people just skip past the text/speech of getting a quest and handing it back in all they see is &quot;Go kill 8 'X' and come back to me&quot; or &quot;Go get 'X' item for me and bring it back&quot;. That doesn't tell the story at ALL because you miss why you are going to do that in the first place. If people want story they should just read the text or listen to what the quest giver says. If you don't get story from that there are free ways of finding the story or &quot;lore&quot; out for something, its called google.com</div></div><hr />

Wonder if the duration increase means a lower proc chance or not. It's already kind of sad to see an arms warrior with Gurthalak do 3 times more damage with the tentacles than my unholy DK while wielding the same version and having mastery to buff it.<br />
<br />
warriors mastery has a chance to proc the sword.<br />
unholy mastery buffs the proc by 20-30%<br />
<br />
at least in pvp the sword on an unholy dk is devastating compared to a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AFAIK you can transmog the old pvp armor right? Then they added replicas of the armor in area 51 and you cant buy it unless you have the old titles - so totally poinless as you can buy those in SW/ORG anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Many of the original level 60 ranked PvP gear items have had Replica added to the start of their name, making their name identical to the versions being sold in Area 52, for example the Replica High Warlord's Cleaver. However, they still retain their higher item level and stats.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think you can still buy the legacy weapons in cities too. So what are replicas for? :confused: <br />
I would have thought that logically the replica sets would be for people who didnt get rank back in vanilla, but that doesnt seem the case</div></div><hr />

Yet caster dagger never exceeds 1.5% of total damage done, maybe 2.5% in heavy aoe fight with well timed proc. Our fury warrior does 15-20% of his total damage from proc while dual wielding swords. Not everyone has access to legendary, you know.</div></div><hr />

I explicitly said that even non-legendary casters were still outpacing hunters, and the excuse of Dragonwrath being the sole reason for such skewed numbers isn't true. Its not even about the weapons (though I'm not to surprised at Gurthak getting a buff since most 2h wielders are still behind casters, even with ap buffs). The weapons are covering up the problems, or at least the devs are using them as an excuse for their apathy towards the issue. The fact that your warrior has to get such a ridiculous benefit from their weapons to be able to come even with some classes is a symptom of a wider issue.</div></div><hr />

This seems to be the most likely possibility to me. After all, considering the Legion invaded 10,000 years ago, that would certainly leave them with relics. They have sites on Azeroth and Outland. Really does fit. Certainly fits better than them being added to an instance that's already out. TCG seems to be a powerful possibility, but to be honest...Fel Drake seems a little unimpressive for a TCG mount. True, there's been other underwhelming ones, but...I don't know, and the TCG doesn't follow themes so stringently, let alone a Burning Legion theme that's already been done, right?</div></div><hr />

Aside from fixing the Ret Pally bug I'm pretty sure the only &quot;change&quot; to the sword was a tooltip correction.
