Looks that way. :) Very exciting to see Azeroth locations come to life with <br />
such attention to detail.<br />

I'm 99% certain that Duncan is using the in-game backdrop from <br />
SW Keep on his cam just to size everything up so that the actual<br />
thing can be added in properly in post. :)<br />
<br />
Also: The Saberon (That's what the cat's called, right?) looks kinda<br />
silly right now- I think the fur is too flat... BUT! I also am sticking to <br />
my theory that the first Druid set will be based on these guys.</div></div><hr />

Duncan Jones is aiming for a Lord of the Rings feel. Yes, it's going to feel uneven as we see it, but at the same time the concept remains the same. Just give them time and a chance (I hope) for a good movie. Not saying it's going to be better than Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Hobbit, it will be something to take it after is all.:)</div></div><hr />

Can't wait to bring my Worgen hunter here now, lol.<br />
<br />
Also, that movie shot looks interesting. the image of Stormwind Keep Throne Room on the screen looks CGI'd as hell but maybe it's a placeholder mode-..aah who am i kidding? there's no excuses for how weird that looks. The SW Knight looks pretty badass though. Also, that guy on (our) left in the screen, i keep thinking he's Obi-wan and have to remind myself this is a Warcraft movie, not Disney's next installment of Starwars.</div></div><hr />

Really, it's not difficult. A reskin is when the texture, and only the texture, of a model is changed. It's not hard to see from the name to be honest. Re. SKIN. Skin, as in, you know, the texture applied to the surfaces of the model?<br />

Unless you're half-blind, you can tell that the model is quite clearly different to the Worgen. It only reuses the Worgen's skeleton- it's posture, animations and so on.<br />

Because I despise when people criticise based on a complete lack of knowledge. And especially when that 'knowledge' is astoundingly easy to understand. People really should know better by now.<br />

Nope. Actually look hard at the model instead of over-simplifying it for the sake of getting annoyed at Blizz.<br />

Heh, well I obviously don't work for Blizz, but I am studying with 3D modelling at uni. As for the model, you are perfectly free to criticise it all you want - I'm not even that much of a fan of it. Just 'reskin' when it's not a reskin gets on my nerves.</div></div><hr />

...the whole point of his post was that people do NOT understand what those terms mean. If they do understand, they wouldn't be calling something a &quot;worgen reskin&quot; when it clearly is not. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless you're half-blind, you can tell that the model is quite clearly different to the Worgen. It only reuses the Worgen's skeleton- it's posture, animations and so on.<br />

It takes a lot of work to do that it's not easy. Or did you think they were lazy when they reused the Tauren Skeleton for Broken? They've been doing this since forever. It's not a big deal as you make it out to be.</div></div><hr />

Every dam company reuses models &amp; skeletons, but apprently people just notice Blizzard &amp; use it as a way to whine about something. <br />
<br />
Raysz is right it is just getting bloody old &amp; annoying, But people seem to keep being surprised that they are reusing a skeleton. Not one company uses different skeletons they are all the same just modified from what the original model has.<br />

No it's not, you absolute ignoramus. You wanna wait another expansion for new character models while tacking on another several months of development to this one so that these worthless faceless mooks can walk a little differently? They have the same body type, therefore same skeleton.<br />

I meant lorewise. We've had a number of novels set in pre-exploded Draenor, we've explored all over Outlands, inclding archeologists, we've even spoken with natives who lived there before it shattered, and they have never been mentioned, nor hinted at before. And it bugs me. If we really needed a new savage humanoid race, why not do something with the Sporegarr? <br />
<br />
Instead we're just supposed to pretend that they've been here all along, and the Orcs, Daenei, Naruu and Arroka never mentioned them because reasons.<br />
<br />

Wasn't there one of these cat people in Shat when BC came out? I remember one, but can't find anything that confirms my memory. I remember there being one, and then all of the sudden it was gone.<br />

from what we can see, that shot on the camera monitor is of the throne room of king terenas menethil II in lordaeron, so, just my guess, but this movie is gonna be either relating to the burning legion invasion (warcraft 3 reign of chaos) or, the story leading up to the creation of the scourge and the arthas/lich king story line (warcraft 3 the frozen throne), personally, i'm hoping for the arthas plot line but more likely is the burning legion and introduction of the horde to then segway into the frozen throne story line.</div></div><hr />

thats not a reskin though, a reskin would be if they just took the worgen model and changed the colour patterns, in this case the model have elements that the worgen model does not, hence it is a new model with the same skeleton as the worgen.</div></div><hr />

I think I know why people call it a reskin though. What's described in that picture as a &quot;remodel&quot; is still called skin in the case of games like DOTA, Heroes of The Storm, Smite, etc so I can understand people using it in WoW too. Here's an example of different &quot;skin&quot; available for Kerrigan in HOTS that turns her into a succubus: http://i.imgur.com/GkPwGp0.jpg You can see that she has new elements like horns, more substantial wings, new outfit, and different textures but it's still called a &quot;skin&quot;.

theres a big difference between that terminology and this terminology.<br />
<br />
thats the lingo of that game. this is the lingo of 3d graphics. Especially since that is explicitly not their intention and still plain wrong. Re-skins are not a term used in the context you are bringing. I do agree that what you stated is the reason people are being confused over the terminology but that still means they're completely wrong (and basing their opinions and logic on whats wrong).<br />

They're far from lazy, they have so many different animation rigs compared to a lot of other games where 90% of player races and NPCs are variations on humanoid and all use the same rig.

We already know that it's an adaptation of Warcraft I.<br />
<br />
Either they're working Lordaeron into the plot (perhaps something as simple as messengers visiting Terenas to warn of the invasion or request aid, or negotiate for evacuations of Stormwind), or they're taking creative license and using the WC3 Lordaeron armor for Stormwind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is definitely the throne room of Stormwind, not Lordaeron. Take a look at a screenshot of the SW throne room. Also, another give-away is the alliance banner that is hanging from the rafters. Lordaeron does not hang that banner from their walls - they usually stick to their kingdom's symbol, the &quot;L&quot;.</div></div><hr />

What's described in that picture as a &quot;remodel&quot; is still called skin in the case of games like DOTA, Heroes of The Storm, Smite, etc so I can understand people using it in WoW too. Here's an example of different &quot;skin&quot; available for Kerrigan in HOTS that turns her into a succubus: http://i.imgur.com/GkPwGp0.jpg You can see that she has new elements like horns, more substantial wings, new outfit, and different textures but it's still called a &quot;skin&quot;. That's just the terminology people use for when you take a base model/skeleton and change elements to make it different.<br />
<br />
Yeah, this guy with the crusade to fix terminology needs to realize that a LOT of terminology, in everything from tech to medicine to science changes once it goes mainstream and is no longer precisely accurate. Reskin is now basically ´based on the model of´. Also, it doesn´t help that there is no simple term to use instead of ´reskin´ in those situations. Remodel? reframe? and then you would have to add ´reskin´ on the end of it anyway. ´OMG, Blizzard is so lazy, this is just a remodeled, reframed and reskinned version of the Worgen´..<br />

I'm wondering about the clothes being worn in the movie shot. I haven't seen anything like that except for very low level armor. Looks more like something worn in Star Wars. Where's the huge shoulders.<br />

Yes, it's going to feel uneven as we see it, but at the same time the concept remains the same. Just give them time and a chance (I hope) for a good movie.

It'll be hardto beat lotro, but if it's not better than the bloated hobbit films it will be awful.<br />

<br />
- The room IS Stormwind Throne Room (because we know there is a big portion of the story involving Stormwind and because the way it looks + they SAID that they will try and keep the overall look of the game but some things will have to be changed to be adapted to the big screen. AKA the guards armour. Also that on the wall is a Stormwind flag! <br />
- Another fact is that the movie is SHOT IN 3D. THE camera on that crane above Duncan is similar to the ones used in the new Hobbit movie (for those who saw the videos Peter Jackson uploaded to youtube about the on-set work, know what im talking about)<br />
- Another thing is the movie will be ALOT darker than we can see in the photo. AL heavy CGI movies are shot under alot of lighting because on post production they can add darkness and certain colors to the scenes. Also this is hapening so that the fine detail of the sets can be captured by the cameras.<br />
- About the 2 guys in the shot. They are farmers coming to the king for an audience (note the poor clothing)<br />
<br />
Everything else is pure speculation...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since when has blizz re-using models been new? They've been re-using models SINCE THE FIRST EXPANSION. These people are just a sub-race in WoD and will mainly be seen as enemy mobs, so why waste time on designing a whole different skeleton for the race when you can use one that already fits the concept of ferocious, and savage tribe of primal hunters &amp; gatherers? They have a shit ton of new models already, and one recycled mob isn't a big deal. Geez, the fact that you folks have been complaining about recycled models like it's a hot-button issue each time since 08 baffles me. Talk about short-term memory.<br />
<br />
It's easier to do and actually saves resources for blizz. Those same resources that are apparently lost even when blizzard drops a hat.<br />
<br />
Also, I like how folks complain about Saberon never being in the lore. The story of Pandaria, shado-pan, etc was never in original lore, but look how well-done it is. If you say it's bad, that's subjective, the point is that they crafted many great storylines with Pandaria (i.e. Shaohao, Liu Lang) and even tied some of it in with existing lore such as The Titans and Old Gods (Mantid, Mogu, and Sha storylines). so them adding in a race we haven't known about yet isn't a bad thing seeing as how they were able to pull off stuff like that in Pandaria without botching it up.<br />
<br />
And while you might say there's a difference between retconning and creating new lore, the lore of Draenor and anything involved with it has been changed several times before, so that argument is rather moot. It's blizzard's story, not ours. Let them do what they want with it.<br />
<br />
Also, the Ninjanite thing is crafted of engineering, but requires a philosopher's stone? o_O that's weird. It's probably a joke on dataminers (like Fudgehammer (http://beta.wowhead.com/item=107956#news), or Medhiv's Big Birthday Bash (http://www.wowhead.com/news=224496/patch-5-4-november-25th-hotfixes-patch-5-4-2-build-17614-spell-changes).) But some people take that shit too seriously. It could also just be a funny coincidence. i'm no expert on metals, or grammar, but &quot;ite&quot; in the name usually means it's a derivative of something, right? The actual thing could be named something completely different.</div></div><hr />

...Good lord. Not only have you said it's a reskin (it's not by the way, it only reuses the skeleton), but you've actually got the model it's supposedly a reskin of wrong.<br />

It uses the Worgen skeleton, not the Orcs. Only similarity between it and Orcs is that they're both bipedal with two arms and a single head.<br />

Fine. Lets get down to the core issue then. No one cares if you think recycling a skeleton is a bad thing. Its overwhelmingly labor intensive to make new ones for every creature and would further cripple the content dev speed. Its too slow now without adding that worthless overhead to the process.</div></div><hr />

That tail really balances out the model =P. Plus the features are more realistic and perfect.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, this!! because you know.. having combo points saved on your character and not on your target is no big deal, and nobody ever asked for that in the last 8 years.</div></div><hr />

Since it's used to &quot;mega evolve&quot; your engineering skill. Yup...<br />
<br />
Also looks like they did a 180 on the Paladin Seal changes. Was really hoping they would decide to just remove them all though. There's still time I guess. &gt;:]</div></div><hr />

Shhhhhh..... buffs and treats are fantastic but in this case, maybe we're better off. We are the class that has had the least sweeping design changes since Wow began for a reason. We're like sharks. While its not easy to improve on perfection, its sure as hell easy to mess it up by drawing attention to ourselves. Lets just wait, watch, listen, and have some faith.<br />

That horse mount looks soooo flipping amazing. I cant help but be curious if its a 2 person mount since its RAF. It doesnt matter to its coolness factor. I may try and get that one :D Nice touch with how his hooves look like the cow-catchers on a train</div></div><hr />

NOT. A. Bloody. Reskin.<br />
<br />
GAH you people infuriate me so goddamn much. <br />
<br />
Really, it's not difficult. A reskin is when the texture, and only the texture, of a model is changed. It's not hard to see from the name to be honest. Re. SKIN. Skin, as in, you know, the texture applied to the surfaces of the model?<br />
<br />
Unless you're half-blind, you can tell that the model is quite clearly different to the Worgen. It only reuses the Worgen's skeleton- it's posture, animations and so on.<br />
<br />
So please, for the love of all things holy, don't spout off about 'reskins' unless you actually know what a reskin is. Especially not in a snarky smartarse way - it just makes it more embarrassing. I mean, you have almost 5k posts, so you should know what a reskin is by now...<br />

Honestly surprised about lack of beta but whatever I'm enjoying the break right now. While on this break I've been playing ESO. Imagine the chuckle I had when I suddenly see a khajiit on steroids model for WoW. Lawl. It's a cool model and all, but that's funny right there.</div></div><hr />
