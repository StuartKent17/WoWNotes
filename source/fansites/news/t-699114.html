Cataclysm Stats - General<br />
Cataclysm stats recap<br />
DPS cloth: Int, Sta, Hit, Haste, Crit, Mastery (mage, warlock, Shadow priest)<br />
Healing cloth: Int, Sta, Spirit, Haste, Crit, Mastery (Holy and Disc priest)<br />
<br />
Melee leather: Agi, Sta, Hit, Haste, Crit, Mastery, Expertise (rogue, Feral druid)<br />
Spellpower leather: Int, Sta, Spirit, Haste, Crit, Mastery (Resto, Balance druid)<br />
<br />
Physical mail: Agi, Sta, Hit, Haste, Crit, Mastery, Expertise (hunter, Enhancement shaman)<br />
Spellpower mail: Int, Sta, Spirit, Haste, Crit, Mastery (Resto, Elemental shaman)<br />
<br />
DPS Plate: Str, Sta, Hit, Haste, Crit, Mastery, Expertise (Fury, Arms, Retribution, dps DKs)<br />
Tanking plate: Str, Sta, Hit, Armor, Dodge, Block, Parry, Mastery, Expertise (Prot, Prot and tanking DKs)<br />
Healing plate: Int, Sta, Spirit, Haste, Crit, Mastery (Holy paladins)<br />
<br />
There will be exceptions. There might be some spellpower cloth with no hit or Spirit that healers and nukers may want. There will likely be Elemental tier sets with no Spirit. Jewelry and cloaks will be more class agnostic than actual armor pieces.<br />
<br />
I wrote that quickly, so hopefully I didn't mangle anything. :) EDIT: You get a small mastery bonus for wearing the highest-armor gear capable for your class. Hunters in mail get a bonus. Hunters in leather do not. <br />
<br />
Mastery bonus and armor type<br />
There is a small Mastery bonus for wearing &quot;your&quot; gear. So a Balance druid who takes cloth will be essentially giving up free stats. Sometimes that may be worth it to them (just as sometimes it's worth it for a Resto druid to take that piece of +hit gear), but often times it won't be worth it especially if it's an upgrade for you. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425636414-cataclysm-stat--system-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Reforging<br />
Think of reforging like enchants. It's not that you take a piece of gear and turn it into whatever you want. You pick up specific scrolls with specific conversions. We haven't decided on them all yet, but I imagine crit -&gt; parry is not something you're likely to see. Maybe we'd do hit -&gt; dodge for the tank who is full on or doesn't want hit. Maybe we'd do block -&gt; parry to help DKs benefit from more plate.<br />
<br />
Rest assured that we're not going to promote a system where Prot paladins want dps plate for tanking more than tanking plate. Part of all of these changes are to discourage behavior like that. We don't want to recreate it immediately in a different form. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425636414-cataclysm-stat--system-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Haste in Cataclysm<br />
Haste will basically remain the same for casters. It is changing for melee classes, however. Haste will also allow melee classes to recover their resources more quickly, effectively letting them hit their buttons more often. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425636414-cataclysm-stat--system-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Gem sockets and item budget<br />
We take gem budgets out of the most attractive stat on a piece of gear, in order to avoid anything with sockets always trumping similar gear without sockets. As such, socketed tanking plate has less base stamina but with gems, youâ€™ll almost certainly end up with more health than dps classes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425636414-cataclysm-stat--system-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Mastery Bonus<br />
You get a mastery bonus (i.e. free stats) for wearing your gear. If shaman or druids wear cloth, they will do so at a slight stat loss. Sometimes that may still be worth it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23425706470-concerns-about-mailleathercloth-in-cata.html))<br />
<br />
Spirit<br />
Spirit is currently on a lot of cloth gear because it is considered a healing AND dps stat. We are changing it to just be a healing stat. There will still be a lot of it on leather though, just not every piece. Both Spirit and hit are the kind of thing you want enough of and no more than that. Since there won't be any buffs that boost hit or Spirit, you shouldn't often find yourself in excess. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23425706470-concerns-about-mailleathercloth-in-cata.html))<br />
<br />
[...] If we solve the Spirit -&gt; hit conversion through a talent, it will be tacked on to an existing talent so that you aren't really paying for it. We like the talent approach more than a passive ability because the talents let you tell the game &quot;I'm trying to be a caster, not a healer now.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've read several players say that they like to reach their hit cap and then be done with it. But that doesn't really happen because every tier there is more and more hit on gear, forcing you to either swap out some of your excess hit or avoid the new stuff completely. The new model is more that all that extra hit on higher ilevel gear will have a use. <br />
<br />
Plate / Cloth Armor differences<br />
Plate will still possess much more armor than cloth, the difference just wont be as significant as it is now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425636414-cataclysm-stat--system-changes.html))<br />
<br />
[...] posted something similar in the Cataclysm forum, but let's look at actual numbers. A level 80 Prot warrior in Icecrown gear unbuffed has like 45,000 health and 30,000 armor. A level 80 mage in Icecrown gear unbuffed might have 20,000 health and 2000 armor. Yes, 2000 armor. We have a lot of room to narrow the gap a little. It's a big gap. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23425376543-cataclysm-stat-change-preview.html))<br />
<br />
[...] Someone (Angua?) had a post awhile back that explained this using numbers. Cloth won't have as much armor as plate. But maybe it will have half as much armor as plate instead of one fifth as much armor as plate (or whatever the ratios end up being at higher levels).<br />
<br />
Really, cloth isn't the issue, since cloth wearers have spells to buff their mitigation. Leather wearers are the ones who end up the most fragile. Mail would be bad too except that shaman can use shields when needed and hunters typically don't get hit by melee much. We just want to bring things a little closer to each other. It's easier to establish a baseline for how hard a particular attack should hit for when one dps spec isn't literally four times as survivable as another. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425636414-cataclysm-stat--system-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking<br />
Is threat fun?<br />
When threat doesn't matter as a tank, then maximizing your rotation doesn't matter much either. To use the warrior example, you could skip Devastate, Revenge and Shield Slam and just autoattack and use defensive cooldowns. Is that fun? On the other hand, many of the requests we see are for harder hitting attacks, especially on the AE front, so that in essence it's less work to tank multiple mobs at once. Is this really what you want?<br />
<br />
I would assert in the current game that threat is almost never an issue. It might be an issue in the first few seconds of a fight (including when new adds join the party) or when the dps severely outgear the tank (such as in a Dungeon Finder situation). Especially in a world with Misdirect, Tricks of the Trade, and Tauntable bosses, tanks on single-target raid fights get so far ahead of the dps and healers, that catching them would be almost impossible. We could definitely tone this down a little such that tanks needed to fight for threat a little more than they do now. Some players would welcome that change and some would say that Blizzard hates tanks and makes them work too hard. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23425705299-is-threat-fun.html))<br />
<br />
Tank specs in Cataclysm<br />
Tanks will still be required to tank raids and I expect most heroics. You're not in any danger of being upstaged by a dps spec who has slightly more armor and health than they do now. <br />
<br />
Tank vs non-tank classes<br />
Let's compare a level 80 tank to a non-tank. Unbuffed, a level 80 mage in Icecrown gear might have 20,000 health, 2000 armor, 5% dodge, 0% parry, 0% block. Unbuffed, a level 80 Protection warrior in Icecrown gear might have 45,000 health, 30,000 armor, 25% dodge, 20% parry and 20% block. To be fair, the mage can cast armor and has a few defensive spells. The tank has Defensive Stance, cooldowns like Shield Wall and Last Stand, and cannot be crit by mobs.<br />
<br />
Now the mage gets converted to Cataclysm. Let's pick totally wild numbers, like +50% health and +200% armor, which I hope are much too large. The mage now has 30,000 health and 6000 armor. Wow! Still... think he's going to be tanking anything? The tank still mitigates so much damage through armor (what he doesn't avoid) that he'll still shrug off hits that flatten the poor mage tank.<br />
<br />
The numbers are really far off at the moment. We have a lot of room to bring them closer together while still leaving them very far apart.(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/29/23425706735-is-cataclysm-wow-dumbed-down.html))<br />
<br />
&quot;Terrible&quot; stats<br />
I actually disagree with that. The problem we have with current stats is that some are good and some are terrible. To use the Resto druid for example, crit isn't useful because so many hots can't crit and haste isn't useful because so many hots can't be hasted (and talents provide generous cast-time reduction already). To use another example, some mages are very near the crit cap to the point where a trinket that proc'd crit (or even a free crit) would be less attractive that one that proc'd haste. It's not that crit is bad for them. It's just that they have too much.<br />
<br />
The problem is that some stats are twice as good as other stats. If crit was slightly better than haste, you'd take crit given the choice, but still wear haste. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425636414-cataclysm-stat--system-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Shield mechanics in Cataclysm<br />
You'll still be able to line up trinkets and abilities to get really good blocks when you need them. We think this design will let us make blocks more meaningful to the tanking experience since you could actually block 20,000 or more damage on a 60,000 hit. Being able to trivialize lower level mobs is sort of a bizarre perk though (and one not shared by all tank classes) and not something we're really interested in preserving. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23425466604-cata-stat-changes-worrying.html)<br />
<br />
[...] Yeah, that is sort of the intent. We donâ€™t like that block allows certain tanks to trivialize older content. Older content is always going to be easy, but it was a little strange that warriors and paladins could literally take no damage with enough block while DKs still took some damage. Stats need to scale and this one wasnâ€™t. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425636414-cataclysm-stat--system-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking stats disparities<br />
Once upon a time, being a &quot;mana sponge&quot; was a scary thing. Nobody (esp. druids) wanted to be the meat shield that had huge health pools but drained the healers dry. When mana matters, avoidance matters more too. I'm not saying parry will ever trump Stamina, but perhaps Stamina won't trump parry by quite as much as it does today. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425636414-cataclysm-stat--system-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
Healers and mana management<br />
Imagine you have 3 heals: normal, big and fast. The big heal is expensive and the fast heal isn't very efficient.<br />
<br />
In your 1st tier, healers use their normal heal. The others are reserved for emergencies. In subsequent tiers, their regen is such that they can afford to branch out more into the expensive big heal and the inefficient fast heal. But while that is happening, the encounters are stepping up too. You'll need the fast heal sometimes because the damage is coming in too fast. You'll need the big heal more because sometimes you have to get someone back from the brink in a single GCD. Fortunately, as you approach the final tier, your mana regen is such that you can handle not casting your base heal as often.<br />
<br />
The problem currently is that efficiency is a pretty low concern given that if you don't land a heal right this second, someone may die, and your chance of running out of mana is pretty low in the first place. There is every reason to just use the inefficient flash heal. Likewise, health is too low (relative to damage) so the big heal is just overhealing. And someone can probably flash your target up before you finish that long cast. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/23425466380-running-oom-was-never-fun.html))<br />

Scourge Strike and DKs in PvP<br />
We don't like melee strikes hitting for straight magical damage. We went through a lot of similar balance issues when Ret hit for so much Holy damage and to a lesser extent with Frost DKs. I agree we have some confusing tooltips, but I don't agree that Scourge Strike is one of them. It's a weapon attack that hits for physical damage. If there are diseases on the target, it adds some Shadow damage too. Doesn't seem that complicated. <br />
<br />
[...] We're happy with how much damage DKs can do in PvP. They were too susceptible to dispels, and we have now implemented a fix to help with that.<br />
<br />
Class abilities are different. Envenom is not Scourge Strike. Rogues still do a lot of physical damage. Frost Strike still hits for 100% magic damage, but it's a more controlled ability. The DK in PvP hitting for huge Scourge Strikes over and over again is not something we're going to go back to. It may have been fun, but I assert it was fun because it was overpowered not because Shadow damage is somehow more entertaining.<br />
<br />
Players using armor pen to hit for physical damage do not hit for magical damage. The closest argument could make is that bleeds act similar to magic damage.<br />
<br />
Obliterate is a different ability. Unholy has talents that play off of both Scourge Strike and Shadow damage. If we see Unholy DKs literally going to Obliterate and skipping those relevant talents (which some PvE DKs were doing before), then we would make changes, but they don't seem to be doing that now. We're certainly not going to make Scourge Strike HIT REAL HARD in order to distinguish it, so make sure you're asking for what you really want and not try to sneakily ask for a damage buff.<br />
<br />
In general, I find arguments to be generally weak that say &quot;This class does X so I should be able to as well.&quot; If you have specific problems in PvP, mention those. If you think your damage is too low to exert pressure, that's a fine conversation to have. I would try to do it without the &quot;But X ability hits hard, so mine should too&quot; talking points.<br />
<br />
Finally, this dead horse feels a little dead to me. You might want to check out some of our (numerous) comments on the intent for Scourge Strike before you hit that Post button again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23425376412-33-scourge-strike-was-a-failure.html))<br />

Druid tanking in Cataclysm<br />
If druids have lower avoidance (assuming you call the new parry and block avoidance), then they'll have higher armor and health to compensate. There is no reason druids must have block and parry to be competitive. They really haven't missed it much in WotLK.<br />
<br />
I think the only real risk to druids from a design paradigm perspective is the risk of being a mana sponge. Druids were worried about that coming into this expansion, but as we've seen, it wasn't an issue. With mana mattering more, it could be, but high armor will still help with that.<br />
<br />
The comment about leather was just that if leather provides as much health as plate, then the Bear multiplier doesn't need to be as high for druids still to have higher health than other tanks.

Spell ranks removed - What about the food/water?<br />
There won't be a way or need to cast the lower level spells. If you're just worried about losing the flavor of croissants vs. strudel, we're keeping that. At some point you'll just start making the better breads. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425636414-cataclysm-stat--system-changes.html))<br />

Mellee classes already have far too much burst dps over clothies, because mellee yellow attacks are instant damage whilst caster yellow attacks have to wait xx seconds before the damage connects.<br />
<br />
I'm not happy about this change at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Learning to read and understand correctly is also imporant. &gt;:(<br />
<br />
What the haste change means, is that melee resources like rage regenerate more quickly. What this does not mean, is that melee classes would hit any faster.<br />
<br />
Pressing more buttons vs. actual increased speed of attacks - they're two different things.</div></div><hr />

Use them or don't, they're optional. Frankly if you've already done the content, who cares then, this will just speed things up and prep you for Heroics or something.</div></div><hr />

Casuals still won't defeat the Lich King on 25 man with this buff. You can't just waltz in and defeat the 3 main bad bosses, putricide, lana'thel and sindragosa with 30% extra buff. They will succeed after a while in normal, but heroic? No way.<br />

Yes, there will be two hard mode Arthas world firsts. First guild to kill him, period, and first guild to do it without the buff (if that's even possible). It's not like the hardcore guilds are right on the doorstep of beating Arthas HM and this is going to push them over the edge.</div></div><hr />

sorry mister, my first language ain't English, so forgive a few of my mistakes. second, it is of course nice to see most of the content, but at the same time, I want to do it on my own, that makes it a bigger achievement. I feel that buff ruins a lot of that fun, but that is for me personally. Maybe my first post wasn't good then, but I'm worried about a few large guilds with even bigger slackers in it get a chance to just burn away some hard bosses, just because of the extra % dmg. <br />
(btw, I'm in a casual guild as well, and I just deal with the fact I can't see all content. but hey, that's what youtube is for:))</div></div><hr />

It's optional so people can still do the encounters as they were intended, if they wish. I think this is great as I am working through early hard modes and will use the buff to speed up the farm kills on normal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) LK HM has now be downed yet. Maybe it has been blizz's intention that he is only killable with this buff? I dunno tho.<br />
<br />
2) It's a mechanic to make things easier for YOU. Well, why shouldn't you use it? You use the best enchants, the best gems, the best buffoods etc. But you complain about another thing that actually BUFFS you? I dont freaking get it. You don't even have to spend gold on it like you do for enchants 'n stuff.<br />
<br />
3) After all, you can turn it off. Guilds who aren't top of the league can use it, yeah. But why should YOU HARDCORE RAIDERZZ PRO GAM0RZ even care about it? It's their thing if they raid with the buff or without it. Your guild still can turn it off. So stop the frekaing hate around here.</div></div><hr />

Because it requires enormous amounts of time beyond 6hrs a week just to reach LK right, typical bad (sorry very un pc of me I mean blizzard core market) excuse makes me die inside<br />
<br />
<br />
This buff sucks to be blunt far too early and is it really needed the way normal modes are now, if any guild is a raiding guild and not working on end wing bosses by now casual or hardcore there is something seriously wrong somewhere. If you are welcoming this because your guild raids for a laugh or you pug stfu and make the transition to a raiding guild, it's called raiding content for a reason. Of course the buff is optional but who the fuuk will be ermm no guys we won't use it, whilst others will and it been faceroll.</div></div><hr />

What about casters? Hopefully its a small amount or else rogues (possibly warriors) will dominate since they have no cast timers and relatively low CDs. Haste affecting CDs for casters would be cool tho =P<br />

and I don't see why not make that raid wide buff - I for one am in a slow moving guild, we have only killed 6 bosses so far in ICC, yes....flame me, but I still have fun playing with my friends :)<br />

<br />
Note: Only 1.7% of guilds on wow progress have killed the Lich King on 25 normal.<br />
<br />
Only reason I can think that players will not like this buff is because they want feel special because only a few players actually killed the Lich King. Itâ€™s a video game, Itâ€™s entertainment, whatâ€™s the point of playing WoW if you canâ€™t experience end content because you are in a guild of friends that are casual. <br />
<br />
To those stuck up people, if you want to feel special then find the cure for cancer. I heard no one got the achievement yet.</div></div><hr />

You're right, but it still makes no sense playing without the buff... you could just as well say let's play without our normal buffs, it makes the fight harder.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alveia</div><div class="date">2010-03-02, 06:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my opinion of it. Wrath of the Lich King adopted this new philosophy of making content accessible. Everyone deserves the right to see content in some way shape or form, whether they prefer 10 or 25 man raids, or whether they are looking for a tough challenge or something easy. <br />
<br />
Normal mode exists for the purpose of everyone seeing the fights, experiencing the story, and what have you. Heroic mode is stated to exist solely for hardcore raiders to challenge themselves at a higher level, and as such it has better rewards in the way of loot, and vanity items, including the 310% raid mounts. The ICC raid wide buff is intended to allow for even more accessibility, and more people seeing the content / story / etc. <br />
<br />
What I don't understand is why Heroic mode needs to be more accessible, when it's existence was for people who sought a challenge, and earned higher rewards because of it? By the end of this expansion, this will compromise the integrity of heroic loot, titles, achievements, and Glory raiding mounts, which I feel is very unfortunate. I know many people will disagree, which is understandable, as this is just my opinion on the matter. <br />
<br />
I won't quit the game, or stop raiding, or anything silly like that because of this, but in terms of competition between guilds, and the integrity of the raid itself as well as the rewards, I feel this is a poor decision for the game, and am disappointed in its implementation.</div></div><hr />

There was a ~30% nerf to bosses near the end of TBC. It's not surprising, or anything new really.<br />
<br />
They just took the simple route this time. One big adjustment, rather than dozens of small ones.<br />
<br />
Plus, this way it's optional so that people can beat the bosses without it.</div></div><hr />

The versions of the raidwide buffs have been posted on frontpage of MMO-Champion more than 1 month ago, all the 6 versions of them (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30%). Again, why are ppl surprised that &quot;it's up to 30%!!!!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Blues also said even before IC went live that the guilds looking for a real challenge can turn off the buff and then try defeating heroic LK, if they're that skilled. Why all the hate about the buff when you can just disable it if you're that pro?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
First of all, no one is downing the Lich King if they haven't averaged a lot more than 6 hours a week since they started playing WoW. If they are, they're being carried by players who are a lot more dedicated than then.<br />
<br />
Second, why does it bother you? I'm in a guild that has not yet dropped any of the wing bosses. I still have fun playing, but typically we get in about 6 hours of raiding, the majority of which is eaten up doing VoA, the raid weekly, and then all the non wing boss mobs. We get at best 10 attempts a week on the wing bosses, and although we would eventually get some of them down, it's doubtful we'd ever get the Lich King down before the very end of the expansion unless we get some help along the way. The question is: Why would it bother you if we kill the LK thanks in part to this buff?<br />
<br />
I was pretty proud of beating The Legend of Zelda (both quests) without using a hint book, Nintendo Power, etc. For a nine year old that was pretty cool. My satisfaction never decreased from knowing that other people used Game Genie or an official guide, or cheat codes, or whatever. My accomplishment, great or small, was my own, and it was on my own terms, and if every person in America manages to beat The Legend of Zelda, that will never diminish.<br />
<br />
If you beat the Lich King on your own terms, whatever they are, then who cares if I come along and beat him three months later? Do you think you are e-famous? Do you think any one cares that you were 17th in the world to beat him other than you? Other than you, do you think any one will ever care that you killed him with or without the buff?<br />
<br />
What other people do should not have a large impact on your enjoyment. You know what you've accomplished, and if personal pride isn't enough reward than tough cookies, because no one else gives a crap.</div></div><hr />

Frost mage damage are too low to exert pressure right now. i dont think a buff of 5% is enough. We are replace by lock right now. They do damage, CC and more damage. Now we are going to loose absorbtion bonus from disc priest. So why take a mage? Mage are broken right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People do what they really want, they can say all kinds of things.<br />
<br />
For example your guild says they are all cool and bash WoW for being casual on a daily basis. But in reality the majority of your guild doesn't have the balls to actually play without the buff and will use it whilst telling everyone how lame it is.<br />
<br />
So you say you hate the buff, but that's just what you say. Fact is you love the buff, it shows in your actions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In the same time, someone can say that the buff should be higher on heroic modes and still won't make that big impact than it does on normal modes. Because usually heroic modes are more about coordination/skill than they are about more dps/hp. Sure, heroic modes needs both of these things, but you can even have the +100% buff version, as a guild, but if you don't have the coordination/skill needed for heroic modes, you still won't get anywhere even with the buff.<br />

And as has been said to every other kneejerking cretin in this thread: You can turn the buff off if you want a challenge.

<br />
This simply isn't true from my experience thus far in Heroic ICC. Marrowgar Heroic makes being too close to Bone Storm or running through Coldflame a real hazard that can wipe your raid, bone spikes hit for a ton more and need to be killed quickly during Bone Storm. The buff negates the entire challenge of this fight at its full effect.<br />
<br />
The challenge of Deathwhisper Heroic is that if anyone is hit by a ghost it's an instant wipe, but with the buff you will have so much health that ghost damage is inconsequential now because you can survive it, and therefore have no reason to even move.<br />
<br />
Gunship, lol.<br />
<br />
Saurfang Heroic has very steep DPS, healing and tanking requirements which make it challenging, with the buff this is essentially negated, because marks are easier to heal due to more healing and more health, and he dies faster resulting in fewer marks and less BP gain from the large DPS increase.<br />
<br />
While I personally haven't attempted any other heroic fights yet, I imagine this trend will continue throughout the entire raid, with Heroic LK possibly being the only fight not trivialized by the full buff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lazoric</div><div class="date">2010-03-02, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I shall explain to you how haste works and then you can judge for yourself - <br />
<br />
White hits (melee) - Decreases the white attack swing timer so that the time between each swing is shortened, thus providing more dps. White attacks are unaffected by lag and receive full haste benefit all of the time you stand close to the boss. Haste on white attacks is a passive bonus that is not prone to user error.<br />
<br />
Channelled and cast times (caster) - Does not decreases the time between attacks (unlike melee haste), but rather decreases the time it takes to cast or channel a spell. Since the time between casted attacks is 100% user dependant and therefore affected by lag, haste for casters does not provide full bonus all of the time. It is not passive, prone to user error and is valued a heck of a lot less in lag period.<br />
<br />
DoT's - Completely unaffected by haste. Only SOME dots if glyphed will benefit from haste. Rest of the dots receive no haste benefit at all.<br />
<br />
Proposed changes - The time between melee yellow attacks is decreased.<br />
<br />
This is exponentially unfair towards casters because haste passively affects white hits which recieve full benefit and user error and lag have no affect on the white attacks. Yellow attacks are instant damage, whereas casted attacks have to wait xx seconds before the damage lands.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if this change happens in Cata we have - <br />
<br />
Melee - Receive 100% benefit from a passively working haste buff on white attacks, and full haste benefit on instant damaging attacks that will only minorly be affected by lag, and almost no impact on user error if they mash there buttons.<br />
<br />
Casters - Receive 100% benefit from haste WHILST CASTING, no benefit whatsover whilst moving, and some damage attacked (DOTS) receiving no benefit whatsoever from haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
THAT is why it is unfair.<br />
<br />
<br />
You need to read back on what blizzard said earlier about haste. weapon swing decreasing for melee is getting removed in favor for the rage/energy/focus/etc resource thing they mentioned.<br />
<br />
Some DoTs scale with haste now in 3.3.3 without glyphs and glyphs are getting a complete overhaul anways.<br />
<br />
If dont keep track of these things we cant help you in future when you make a fool of yourself.</div></div><hr />

Haste in Cataclysm<br />
Haste will basically remain the same for casters. It is changing for melee classes, however. Haste will also allow melee classes to recover their resources more quickly, effectively letting them hit their buttons more often. <br />
<br />
&quot;Also,&quot; as in, &quot;in addition to,&quot; not &quot;instead of.&quot; Melee attack speed haste isn't going anywhere. I haven't seen anything contrary to that.<br />
<br />
If there's a blue post somewhere that says that melee attack speed haste is going away, we'd love to see it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheSecretArts</div><div class="date">2010-03-02, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">10 men are easy because most of us do them in 25 men gear.<br />
<br />
But if people are only using 232 gear for it, I'm not sure it's THAT easy.<br />
<br />
You don't get into groups with 232 iLvl gear on my server. 245 iLvl or better for ICC-10 on my server for the most-part. Of course there are a few raids with 232 requirement but most are higher.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reeve</div><div class="date">2010-03-02, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I shall explain to you how haste works and then you can judge for yourself - <br />
<br />
White hits (melee) - Decreases the white attack swing timer so that the time between each swing is shortened, thus providing more dps. White attacks are unaffected by lag and receive full haste benefit all of the time you stand close to the boss. Haste on white attacks is a passive bonus that is not prone to user error.<br />
<br />
Channelled and cast times (caster) - Does not decreases the time between attacks (unlike melee haste), but rather decreases the time it takes to cast or channel a spell. Since the time between casted attacks is 100% user dependant and therefore affected by lag, haste for casters does not provide full bonus all of the time. It is not passive, prone to user error and is valued a heck of a lot less in lag period.<br />
<br />
DoT's - Completely unaffected by haste. Only SOME dots if glyphed will benefit from haste. Rest of the dots receive no haste benefit at all.<br />
<br />
Proposed changes - The time between melee yellow attacks is decreased.<br />
<br />
This is exponentially unfair towards casters because haste passively affects white hits which recieve full benefit and user error and lag have no affect on the white attacks. Yellow attacks are instant damage, whereas casted attacks have to wait xx seconds before the damage lands.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if this change happens in Cata we have - <br />
<br />
Melee - Receive 100% benefit from a passively working haste buff on white attacks, and full haste benefit on instant damaging attacks that will only minorly be affected by lag, and almost no impact on user error if they mash there buttons.<br />
<br />
Casters - Receive 100% benefit from haste WHILST CASTING, no benefit whatsover whilst moving, and some damage attacked (DOTS) receiving no benefit whatsoever from haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
THAT is why it is unfair.<br />
<br />
<br />

It is because PuGs suck, and usually tend to fall apart after 2 wipes. So you gotta build your pug around the fact that it is either going to down the bosses in one or two attempts or it's not gonna down anything.</div></div><hr />

You are leaving out that haste also can reduce the spell GCD from 1.5 seconds to 1.0 seconds. It does not do that for Melee. So &quot;The time between melee yellow attacks is decreased&quot; as you put it is essentially accomplishing the same thing as haste reducing the spell GCD.</div></div><hr />

You can. It's called click a few buttons and turn off the buff. It's like sartharion...<br />
Easy mode, semi-hard mode (Heroic with buff), hard mode (heroic without buff).<br />
If you are complaining that doing heroic without buffs needs extra loot, just stop now. It doesn't need extra loot, either do it if you want the challenge or don't.</div></div><hr />

Stupid mouthbreathers who couldn't do SWP now bitching the game's too easy, you're what makes this game dumb. Casuals look at buffs like these and are giddy. Actual hardcores are too busy doing HM LK to care. You just sit around bitching that someone might kill some bosses. /GASP</div></div><hr />

It's not that the dailies, weeklies and VoA take less time then one ICC raid, I never clocked how long it took to do those. It's the fact that ICC is one big lump of time.

(btw, I'm in a casual guild as well, and I just deal with the fact I can't see all content. but hey, that's what youtube is for:))<br />
<br />
<br />
The buffs have an off button, you and your raid don't have to partake, that's the thing. And big deal if larger guilds do that, how is that of anyone's concern but theirs? And the problem with youtube is that I'm not in those videos.<br />
<br />
Remember folks this isn't a passport to faceroll, its not like 30% makes ICC equivalent to AQ.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, right, Cataclysm in November ... what is wrong with you November people?? I suggest total frontal lobotomy and a glass of warm milk.<br />
<br />
Don't know what to think of the buffs. On one hand it looks super cool but on the other it will really take the edge of the encounters.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, November makes sense Xingu. There is another MMO, Star Wars: The Old Republic, coming out in November so to avoid losing any clients to the newer game Cata would come out in November.</div></div><hr />

That just reduced health of bosses by 30% which buffing the damage 30% is equivalent to. This also buffs the healing and HP of players.<br />
<br />
I for one welcome it, gives me as an experienced player with not much time to raid a chance to get the frost wyrm. And before some hardcore arsehole starts telling me as a casual to stfu i have been ranked in one of the top guilds in the past and have since lost the time to dedicate to hardcore raiding.</div></div><hr />

In ICC's case, the raid is now out for about 3+ months (3 weeks since the heroic mode was unlocked), and boss that has been nerfed was only deathwhisperer (only on normal). And nerfing bosses have been around since when, last 5 years or so? <br />
<br />
The only thing that's making me laugh is, The Lich King, THE BIG DOG, was never defeated on hc mode in either 10 or 25 man before the raid buff (in other word, before he was nerfed), making him the toughest boss ever. Suck's for people who cried for the past 1.5 years about wotlk being faceroll, when wotlk provided the top 2, most difficult bosses the game has ever seen, THE LICH KING and YOGG-SARON (without keepers).

It's just that it didn't have any artificial restrictions placed on how many tries guilds could have at it. I think my guild did roughly 500 or so attempts before we killed that bastard. <br />

That and the fact it would happen to be 2 years from release of Lich King. And in time for their 6th anniversary.<br />
Would make good sense for it to be around November :)<br />

Might be earlier, might be later. Only one way to find out really. Play the waiting game as always.<br />
<br />
Who knows, we may see more than just the one extra raid under wyrmrest temple yet.<br />
And ofc there will be the pre-cata event for a couple of months like we had before lich king.<br />
<br />
Back on topic with the new raid buff, I think it's a good idea. If you haven't cleared ICC normal by now then you can't be in a serious raiding guild. And if you have and don't like the buff, you can simply disable it.<br />
<br />
No point in bitching about it. Blizzard have to try and keep 10 million+ customers happy and that ain't ever gonna be an easy thing to do if people keep moaning all the time.</div></div><hr />

This was indeed true, some crazy high end guilds &quot;Calculated&quot; the C'thun encounter and claimed it was impossible as well.<br />
<br />
C'thun was fixed, not nerfed.<br />
<br />
Back on subject, I really do enjoy the explosive nerd rage and cries that the game is now &quot;Dead&quot;...Really, what the hell? Do you even understand what the main purpose of this game is to Blizzard? A business. The raid buff will most certainly draw in and keep the casual player base happy, because encase you didn't know, there the MAJORITY. And also, IT'S OPTIONAL. <br />

<br />
Tell me something, how many of those 500 pulls your guild made ended with someone making a mistake and going &quot;oh shit, ma bad&quot;? How many of those pulls had your tanks dieing instantly because your healers slacked? How many of those pulls ended poorly because most people in your raid were fed up or tired? With limited attempts, those mistakes will cost you greatly, so everyone have to bring their A game all the time.<br />
<br />
Also people keep bringing the limited attempts again and again, then they say limited attempts suck because end game guilds make alts and try the bosses on them, then do with main. They also go and try out 10 man and learn strategy again and again. You guys contradict yourself all the time. All guilds have spend more attempts on LK then they did for Mu'ru or whoever you think is the toughest boss in WoW. <br />
<br />
Ok, lets forgot about the LK 25 man and Yogg+0 and lets talk about LK10hc. Guilds are now running with full ICC25hc gear, meaning ilvl277 gear, they still can't kill him on 10hc, while out gearing the encounter by miles. But that doesn't say anything about how difficult he is, does it? ::)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every single one of them. There has not been a single wipe by any guild on any encounter in the history of not just WoW, but any videogame that wasn't the result of a mistake. It is impossible to wipe in any beatable encounter if you didn't make any mistake at all. Duh?<br />
<br />
And C'thun had bugs but that wasn't the reason guilds failed to kill him. Guilds started to kill him after Blizzard drastically reduced the amount of hp that his adds had.<br />
<br />
And the top guilds are hardcore, but you're completely exaggerating how many alt raids they have. For them to have spent more attempts on the LK heroic already than what they have on any boss in WoW would mean they have 10+ alts as geared as their mains. I believe an Exodus/Paragon poster said they don't even have an alt raid as geared as their main. That alt raid is just there to see mechanics. It doesn't have the gear to actually be able to beat any difficult heroic mode encounter.</div></div><hr />

This is a perfect time for a buff if you look at wow progress normal mode charts. The amount of guilds progressing has slowed, so there's a lot of casual guilds stuck on a particular boss including my own.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iratus</div><div class="date">2010-03-02, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tanking<br />
Is threat fun?<br />
When threat doesn't matter as a tank, then maximizing your rotation doesn't matter much either. To use the warrior example, you could skip Devastate, Revenge and Shield Slam and just autoattack and use defensive cooldowns. Is that fun? On the other hand, many of the requests we see are for harder hitting attacks, especially on the AE front, so that in essence it's less work to tank multiple mobs at once. Is this really what you want?<br />
<br />
I would assert in the current game that threat is almost never an issue. It might be an issue in the first few seconds of a fight (including when new adds join the party) or when the dps severely outgear the tank (such as in a Dungeon Finder situation). Especially in a world with Misdirect, Tricks of the Trade, and Tauntable bosses, tanks on single-target raid fights get so far ahead of the dps and healers, that catching them would be almost impossible. We could definitely tone this down a little such that tanks needed to fight for threat a little more than they do now. Some players would welcome that change and some would say that Blizzard hates tanks and makes them work too hard. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23425705299-is-threat-fun.html))<br />

Hp =/= Difficulty. That's the thing most people whined about in this expac. <br />
<br />
Blizz does not make content which can't be cleared, maybe in vanilla and tbc they did, not in wotlk. Ignis and XT are exceptions, but they got fixed quickly. <br />
<br />
Limited attempts suck. Most people will agree. I never said they are awesome. Blizz tried to make content harder with limited attempts, it back fired. <br />
<br />
Do you really think top guilds don't use all their tries for LK? Don't use alts anymore? They don't try LK on 10hc anymore? If you calculate the amount of tries made on 10hc and 25hc, with mains and alts, it ends up almost the same. And how can you be so sure that they are only using 2 characters now and not 3? And how can you be so sure they haven't made that many tires? How about you show proof that they have stopped attempting LK, because i am not buying it :-\</div></div><hr />

It will remain hard for those choosing not to use the buff. And also for those that do hard modes.<br />
I really don't understand all the moaning about it. If you don't like it then turn the buff off.<br />
If others choose to use it and kill a boss you struggled on, you can still flex your e-peen as you killed said boss WITHOUT the buff active.<br />

I suppose that's true. Still, buffing in 5% increments feels like doing brain surgery with a sledgehammer.<br />
<br />
My guild just started working on normal Arthas but that's mostly due to lack of attempts. The extremely huge difference between the easy and hard encounters and the very small differences in reward is killing morale big time. <br />
<br />
It seems that just about everybody that can't raid at the Ensidia level is slowly cutting their raid hours to be at the casual level. My guild started at 22 hours of raiding a week. It went down to 21 in TBC, then 20, then 15, then roughly 12 all in WotLK. In practice, it's close to 10 nowadays. WotLK is just hard in the midcore guilds.</div></div><hr />

And to answer the question, at the moment we still do but as of Cataclysm we will have to pick up new spells at varying levels but we won't have to visit the trainer every 4-6 levels to get say rank 2.<br />

Blizz does not make content which can't be cleared, maybe in vanilla and tbc they did, not in wotlk. Ignis and XT are exceptions, but they got fixed quickly. <br />
<br />
Limited attempts suck. Most people will agree. I never said they are awesome. Blizz tried to make content harder with limited attempts, it back fired. <br />
<br />
Do you really think top guilds don't use all their tries for LK? Don't use alts anymore? They don't try LK on 10hc anymore? If you calculate the amount of tries made on 10hc and 25hc, with mains and alts, it ends up almost the same. And how can you be so sure that they are only using 2 characters now and not 3? And how can you be so sure they haven't made that many tires? How about you show proof that they have stopped attempting LK, because i am not buying it :-\<br />
<br />

Hey, you're the one who made the assertion that guilds have made more attempts at LK than at any other boss in the history of WoW. Burden of proof is on you, buddy.</div></div><hr />

Vanilla and tbc had shit loads of trash, which needed more time, don't forget that. The amount of time spend on bosses is almost the same tbh. <br />

Also haven't they removed limited attempts from normal after the 1st week LK was killed? How is it that your guild still have them?</div></div><hr />

Content is too easy compared to Vanilla and BC raiding styles. Such as, if you cant down a boss, your not progressing, but now its &quot;Hey, we suck guys and cannot down this boss, so lets skip it or do easy mode cuz we cant get our crap together.&quot; Its not a fun competition anymore.

Sorry, limited attempts due to depleted guild roster not due to Blizzard's coding. I should've clarified that.<br />

And it honestly isn't due to trash. There wasn't that much trash on vanilla and TBC that guilds spend more than half their time on them. On farm bosses, yes, but not on progression bosses.</div></div><hr />

This is only partially true, I remember times in TBC where we would be working on M'uru or Kael'thas and have trash respawn ontop of us, there was a lot of trash in TBC, Sunwell had a lot, Hyjal had waves and if you wiped on a wave you had to start ALL over again, how could you forget that? BT had some awful trash, and I think SSC had the worst trash in the entire game, the list goes on, TK, Mag, Gruul, even Karazhan had a ton of trash. If you added up how much time it took to clear to all of the bosses, yeah you'd be dumbfounded. My TBC guild raided something like 5 days a week for TK, SSC, BT, Hyjal. It's not like Wotlk where you had TOC which had no trash, Ulduar which has very little trash between bosses, Sarth which had minibosses and small trash packs, Malygos which had no trash, I think the most trash so far has to be ICC, could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mmmmm, nope, I made a fair assumption by taking into account how guilds are raiding in icc and came up with a number, which makes total sense. They spend attempts on LK in 10/25hc with mains and alts. Someone came in and said, they didn't make those attempts, in other words, they have stopped trying him on 10hc or25hc modes and with mains or alts. So, it means you have to prove me that they have stopped using alts and stopped doing 10hc. Because all i know, most guilds have been screaming about how they are using alts to progress. Even if their alts are not as geared as mains, they are still attempting, which means they do LEARN something.</div></div><hr />

I personally never raided BT and sunwell. But the trash in ssc and tk was awful, shit loads of tiem spend on them. Kara had shit loads of trash. Although ZA along with ulduar and icc have the best trash according to me (adding a little more is fine by me). Mobs before ignis would rape your melee :-X</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say it was that bad. The first 4 bosses in Hyjal are on the order of normal modes in WotLK anyway. The only difficult part of the instance was Archimonde and he had no trash. M'uru didn't really have that much trash, only a few pulls. After they fixed SSC/TK in 2.1, the rest of the bosses that had terrible trash were either easy bosses or let you rez and recover in their room without redoing much of their trash. Only Kael'thas and Kalecgos were the exceptions I could remember, difficult bosses that had lots of respawning trash that needed to be killed again.<br />
<br />
In spite of all that, my guild got to Sapphiron before TBC hit and just killed M'uru before patch 3.0. In WotLK, we were unable to beat Mimiron hard mode, Freya hard mode, YS +2/3/4 and Algalon before we stopped Ulduar to concentrate on TOGC. <br />
<br />
There are only a few normal mode encounters in WotLK that aren't a complete faceroll (YS, Mimiron, Lanathel, Putricide, Sindragosa, LK) and Blizzard is nerfing them very soon after we beat them (or before we do, in LK's case). With how difficult heroic modes are and how slight the better rewards are, many guilds like mine are getting to the point where we just want to faceroll what Blizzard lets us faceroll and then call it a day until they nerf the next encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was talking about the amount trash, not boss difficulty. Having trash spawn ontop of us during a boss encounter was only a problem some of the time, only a few bosses I can think of had trash either directly in our path or shortly before when we had to run back from a wipe. I used Hyjal as an example because if you wiped on one of the bosses before Archimonde you had to do the trash all over again, if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />

It's not a bad thing to nerf trash, really. Trash never challenged people, even if they wipe them on occasion. It's just there to slow people down by making them rez a few players every now and then and have to pause to give sheep targets and crap.

Trash in tbc did challenge alot of guilds and was time consuming. The borg lords in ssc could instantly kill people if you didn't move from his acid in a sec. Also what Jasyn said. <br />

Things trash offered in TBC:<br />
<br />
1. Trash Epics (Lots of them)<br />
2. Rep<br />
3. Use of CC (Remember CC? Yeah, we used it.)<br />
4. Coordination, everything wasn't just bunched up and AoE'd down.<br />

I think you misunderstood that post. Trash wasn't hard in the sense that you didn't really have to learn them. Except Kalecgos' trash, which was retardedly difficult. It was just time consuming in that it will kill a few raid members here and there, slowing people down. Or it will make people waste so much time giving CC targets and crap like that. Time consuming plays a part in difficulty but it doesn't necessarily make things difficult if they are time-consuming.<br />
<br />
Supremus, for example, is just like a trash mob. He almost never fails to kill some people in my guild, took a long time to kill but really was an easy boss that we almost never wipe to.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alt</div><div class="date">2010-03-02, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also remember, trash also dropped a lot more epics and it seemed to drop them a lot more often considering the amount of trash there was.

<br />
I was never a fan of that. People shouldn't be able to grind trash to get BiS gear. Not to mention it made people give the wrong reactions to wiping and having trash respawn. Yay we wiped to Kalecgos, more trash farming!</div></div><hr />

<br />
And about people saying that the guys that downed ICC first will have a moral breakdown, I can only say it happens all the time. How many of you had a Grand Ice Mammoth before 3.1, when you actually had to do the dailys for Sons of Hodir rep and then spending 8000 gold on the mount? I did that and when I did, I bragged to all my friends about it. And all of a sudden my friend has the same mount only in black color just because he was lucky on a roll from VoA raid.

But guess what? All the flaming, nerdraging and yelling at each other won't make Blizzard change their minds. The buff will stay, you will do ICC the way you want to, everyone will be happy. <br />
<br />
And about people saying that the guys that downed ICC first will have a moral breakdown, I can only say it happens all the time. How many of you had a Grand Ice Mammoth before 3.1, when you actually had to do the dailys for Sons of Hodir rep and then spending 8000 gold on the mount? I did that and when I did, I bragged to all my friends about it. And all of a sudden my friend has the same mount only in black color just because he was lucky on a roll from VoA raid. How would you feel? So I am telling you again, It happens all the time and guess what? You can't do ANYTHING to stop it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because having a ground mount in the age of flying mounts was a personal feat of strength and a sign of accomplishment? I don't think I have ever seen anyone brag about having a Grand Ice Mammoth or even a Black War Mammoth, I bought mine for 3k gold from a VoA10 and felt nothing about it. This game has gotten to the point where mounts don't mean anything unless you get them from a Meta, and even then it doesn't mean that much because you can fork over a ton of gold and get a Rusted or Ironbound, and within a few months people will be selling the ICC ones. Just my two cents, don't nerdrage over it.</div></div><hr />

Guilds will always sell meta mounts. Just like many guilds sold ZA mount. They see it as a good income. There is nothing blizz can do about it. The real pros are running around with death's demise, grand crusader and atm kingslayer (not sure if there is a title to kill LK on hc mode). Titles are the best thing to distinguish between hardcore and good raider. Bragging over a mount never made sense to me.</div></div><hr />

You make a valid point, but also take in account that melee generally never have to move, while casters are generally moving all over the place avoiding god knows what, which is a dps loss.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markluzz</div><div class="date">2010-03-02, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I shall explain to you how haste works and then you can judge for yourself - <br />
<br />
White hits (melee) - Decreases the white attack swing timer so that the time between each swing is shortened, thus providing more dps. White attacks are unaffected by lag and receive full haste benefit all of the time you stand close to the boss. Haste on white attacks is a passive bonus that is not prone to user error.<br />
<br />
Channelled and cast times (caster) - Does not decreases the time between attacks (unlike melee haste), but rather decreases the time it takes to cast or channel a spell. Since the time between casted attacks is 100% user dependant and therefore affected by lag, haste for casters does not provide full bonus all of the time. It is not passive, prone to user error and is valued a heck of a lot less in lag period.<br />
<br />
DoT's - Completely unaffected by haste. Only SOME dots if glyphed will benefit from haste. Rest of the dots receive no haste benefit at all.<br />
<br />
Proposed changes - The time between melee yellow attacks is decreased.<br />
<br />
This is exponentially unfair towards casters because haste passively affects white hits which recieve full benefit and user error and lag have no affect on the white attacks. Yellow attacks are instant damage, whereas casted attacks have to wait xx seconds before the damage lands.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if this change happens in Cata we have - <br />
<br />
Melee - Receive 100% benefit from a passively working haste buff on white attacks, and full haste benefit on instant damaging attacks that will only minorly be affected by lag, and almost no impact on user error if they mash there buttons.<br />
<br />
Casters - Receive 100% benefit from haste WHILST CASTING, no benefit whatsover whilst moving, and some damage attacked (DOTS) receiving no benefit whatsoever from haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
THAT is why it is unfair.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet think it this way, most hunters, rogues, and warriors dont want haste AT ALL. They would much rather have armor penetration and crit because haste barely benefits us, and blizz is basically taking armor pen away besides in talents where we may get 20-40% which is no where near how much we have now. If you look at it our damage should be about the same from the massive armor pen drop we will recieve.</div></div><hr />

Ah so it's on by default. You gotta be some kind of masochist to turn it off I guess. If you want bragging rights that's what hard modes are for.<br />
<br />
Blizzard really wants people to see ICC! I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard make it go beyond 30% if they don't see enough people completing it. Though 30% is quite a lot you can probably faceroll at that point. :P</div></div><hr />

I, myself, enjoyed playing Dragon Age Origins on Hard Mode, but it didn't give me anything more than the easy mode would have given me. And it was quite cool to be able to switch on easy mode for the really hard bosses or fights.<br />
I really wanted to see how the storyline would go.<br />

Why WoW should be different ? <br />
Actually, WoW gives more to Hardcore Gamers since you can't have Achievements or Special Mounts with the easy mode.<br />

In the end, it's always the same thing.<br />

Yeah, I'm fine with the buff. And I also agree with the whole &quot;just turn it off if you want a challange&quot;. However, I do think some sort of incentive IS in order to raid without the buff. Don't get me wrong , I'm in a fairly average 10man guild who only doing Putricide so I'm not concerned about my own personal epeen or anything. But I don't mind the &quot;hard-core&quot; guilds getting some cool stuff. These guys spend ALOT of time mastering this game and are WAY WAY more skilled than the average player. I don't think theres anything wrong with them flexing their epeen a bit, they deserve to. Give them a cookie why don't ya Blizz. At least remove the buff from the hard modes...geez they are supposed to be ...well...hard aren't they?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well it's pretty simple, bosses in ICC were balanced by using all normal class buffs etc.<br />
So making a fight harder but not using any class buffs or using a tank etc. is not really balanced and can't really be considered &quot;a higher challenge&quot;.<br />
But this zone buff is a straight up less challenge on the content that has already been balanced, so people that don't want to make it slightly easier, can just turn off the buff.<br />
<br />
You will know for a fact that all bosses can be killed without the zone buffs, but you can't really be sure you can kill all bosses without using a tank.<br />
<br />
Even though I'm in a casual guild that haven't even killed LK in normal mode, I think 30% would be too much for Heroic ICC at least. In normal ICC it's just fine, but they should had made max 10% buff in Heroic ICC10/25.</div></div><hr />

When you use a double negative in a sentence it can be a little confusing for people to understand. Here you have actually used a triple negative, lol.
