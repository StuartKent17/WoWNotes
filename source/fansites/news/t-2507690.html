We’ve been monitoring players’ use of layers, and we agree that we should add a delay between subsequent layer transfers. Under the hood we have all the controls I talked about in the Reddit AMA before launch, a few secret weapons we haven’t discussed publicly, and we’re working on deploying some additional controls to further restrain layering from being exploitable.<br />
<br />
However, we also want to assure you that the issue is a much smaller problem than some people are claiming. We’ve been closely monitoring the effect layering is having on economies and other aspects of the game, and many of the stories we see posted are wildly inaccurate. We’ve seen screenshots of banks full of rare crafting materials, which we’ve investigated and proved false.<br />
<br />
Another popular theory is that you can determine your current layer by doing a /who in a capital city, and comparing the results against the /who your friend does. That doesn’t work because /who returns results from the entire realm, not just from your layer, and if the result set is too large it truncates the results before sorting them. This means every player gets different results, but those differences in result set have nothing to do with which layer you’re on. This has led some people to claim that they’ve discovered dozens of layers per realm, but that claim is completely false.<br />
<br />
All realms have a single-digit number of layers. Most of them have a low single-digit number.<br />
<br />
Rest assured that there are not people running around with banks full of (Thorium) Arcane Crystals or Black Lotus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because there are exponentially more ppl trying to play the game now than during vanilla launch, and it would have been a MUCH more different experience NOT having layering than having it (and the servers wouldn't have been able to handle it). Layering has made the experience for 99.9% of people much closer to the actual release experience than if they didn't have it, while also allowing the servers to actually function during launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
have to agree...with the possible exception of Orgrimmar seeming a little quiet on occasion I can say that for the most part the areas I'm in (currently lvl 20) have had a lot of people in them and I'm still having to group often to finish certain quests efficiently on KromKrush.<br />

I want to make you aware of the fact that posts like yours are literally no different from people who claim that the earth is flat, in contradiction of all available scientific evidence, because it's easier for them to think that there is a massive global (planar?) conspiracy to cover up the truth about flat earth than it is for them to admit that they were wrong about something.<br />

Yes, same as how the LFG addon (which existed in Vanilla) was created by BfA players to ruin Classic. /s<br />

This outrage is coming from the Classic fan club, and they're the ones faking evidence to support their narrative. Not very surprising since they have 13 odd years of training on that topic, spreading falsaries and BS that is.</div></div><hr />

He doesn't compare it against a friend? He is comparing it to the proper /who -z command...<br />

You sure it wasn't just teldrassil? I'd imagine they added way more layers to the zones in regard to the amount of people going through them then never wiped the rest. So the starter zones would have heaps of layers then have the other zone ramp down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You are correct that you can determin if 2 players are in the same layer like that if they are also in the same zone.<br />
<br />
The thing is you still can't determing how many layers there are. Layers are a whole world not just a zone. You could be in a layer with 14 poeple in that zone but overall there are 200 people in the same zone on the server and you still only have 2 layers. Now this might be an exaggerated example but without having the data from all layers of a single zone you can't really determin the amount of layers close enough.<br />
<br />
Doing a search over every zone for your layer and all layers and finding all players would come decently close but to make it in time you need a mod or script to run this in time because you do have over 50 people that log in and out per minute. But then you still want to do the same thing while being on differrent layers to ensure you are not randomly on a high or low populated layer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So imagine you are walking from Northshire to Westfall. On that route you have a set of predefined layers of the world where you will appear. In Northshire there are 2 layers because it is currently not very crowded. You are on layer 1, do a /who comparison with a friend and notice there have to be at least 2 layers. Now you walk to Elwynn which is heavily crowded and uses 4 layers currently. You again do a who, get 4 completely new results (because those people from Northshire are not properly included), and determine there must be 4 layers, for a total of 6 layers. The Hogger area however is not crowded at all, so there is only 1 layer active. Again a who tells you completely different results from the previous ones, so you determine there must be at least 7 layers. If you continue that you end up with hundreds of different results, but not because there are hundreds of layers, but because each individual small area has a different setting which gives you different results on your /who check.<br />

I don't know if they are or not. Really don't care about all this layering BS. However, you'd have to be naive in the extreme if you just believed everything blizzard says that is unverifiable.

You again do a who, get 4 completely new results (because those people from Northshire are not properly included), and determine there must be 4 layers, for a total of 6 layers. The Hogger area however is not crowded at all, so there is only 1 layer active. Again a who tells you completely different results from the previous ones, so you determine there must be at least 7 layers. If you continue that you end up with hundreds of different results, but not because there are hundreds of layers, but because each individual small area has a different setting which gives you different results on your /who check.<br />
<br />
Science fact of the day: if you get weird results, then maybe everything is fine, just the way you measure things is wrong.<br />
<br />
I think it was mentioned in a blue post that once you are logged in and put in a layer, you won't leave that layer (or enter another) just by walking or changing zones. In order to change layers you'd have to get grouped with someone who is in another layer, or log out and then back in.</div></div><hr />

But at the same time I can't help but notice they didn't mention exploiting layering to AOE farm mobs at all....And yeah, I do suspect that those guilds that already killed Rag probably are abusing this for crafting mats and stuff. The screenshot of all the level 1 rogues with the same name wasn't doctored. Hopefully they at least give 'em a warning to scare them straight.<br />

this blue poster is ignorant or flat out lying about how the /who command works it can be used to see how many people exist in your layer and can be used to estimate how many layers exist <br />
<br />
on my server ive estimated about 10 different layers 50 is the max result for the /who command but you can include levels or class types to narrow the search and find the total population of each zone and compare it to how many exist within your own layer <br />
<br />

<br />
The thing is the guy in this screenshot is IN teldrassil, which kind of messes up the experiment. /who shows you players on your current layer IN THE SAME ZONE, and that's how it's always worked. By /who 1-60 you forced it to show all layers. <br />
<br />
The blue post was saying two different people OUTSIDE of teldrassil would get different results by doing /who teldrassil, regardless of layer. And yeah, it sounds confusing as I type it, but it does jive with the what the blue post said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Queues and layers have nothing to do with each other. A server with 3 layers will never have a queue.<br />
<br />
Layers exist to prevent 20,000 people from stacking on the same quest mob at the same time to DC people or prevent them from clicking on it.<br />

<br />
Layering was added to prevent the starting zones from being overrun when everyone logged on at the same time to do the starting quests. It makes sense that by the time you get to 60 and if there are only 4-5 other 60s on your server, you could all be in different layers and essentially have a whole zone to farm by yourself. This could result in those people farming lots of stuff relatively quickly.<br />
<br />
They could then log out and back in and have a 4/5 shot at getting put into a different layer and doing it all over again.<br />

Doesn't matter. They'll just tell themselves that Blizzard don't care about their problems and are just trying to milk the cow until it dies.

Layers reduce queue time, just like extra servers would if people would switch to them.<br />
Layers allow you to put 50K or 100K players on a realm, without having to later merge servers and all the troubles that involves when there is the expected 95% drop-off, leaving the realms theoretically with a social population target of 2,5-5K.<br />
It is stated you do not change layers by briefly logging out and back on. I do wonder what their strategy is wrt 'popular' (streamer) layers. Do they put people that logged out in those into a long queue or just put them in another layer that has room?</div></div><hr />

I've also noticed that both /whos now give the same results but I haven't tried to get layered off to check the difference yet. It's still possible that blizzard just broke the command itself.</div></div><hr />
