he talks to u about the need to take more land from the lich king before we can assault the ice crown.<br />
addind aditional argent crusade quests every patch is something good blizz is doing.<br />
instead of taking over whole icecrown in 1 day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, a nice surprise actually.<br />
<br />
I am guessing it will be built in the area in front of the Argent Vanguard is, where (after you have completed the quests there) there are just a load of dragon skeletons. Either that or Scourgeholme will be converted. Either way I am excited. Always happy to see more Paladiny/Argent Crusade stuff.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they will be re-introducing the old realm first titles for the cities i.e. &quot;&lt;name&gt;, of Stormwind&quot; etc.<br />

I like the new content and the quest system to take more Scourge lands but the arena seems like a waste of time. Arthas DESERVES to win. He wants victory more. The Horde and Alliance are busy fighting each other and now only of the 2 groups that were actually focused seems to be wasting time on an arena. Amazing.</div></div><hr />

Possibly you'd carry a certain races banner on your back for cosmetic reasons!? :) I think if they did that it'd be cool if they gave an exp+ buff to your group (yay for running people through stuff!)</div></div><hr />

1. It could be holding an arena that requires that player vs an NPC, but instead of killing, it'll get about 1HP as usual and stop the fight.<br />

or<br />

2. It could be like every other not-PvP arena that they have used, such as the one in Nagrand and the Amp in Zul'Drak.</div></div><hr />

The ability to prove your worth to a capital city of your choosing through our new mounted combat system (still in development)<br />
<br />
You'll probably fight on vechile-like mount of certain capital (Orgrimmar, wolves. UC, skeletal horses etc.) and get some new type of standing with it, maybe even ladder between which capital mounts have won most. Pretty easy to figure out when you count 1+1 while thinking of past change to allow all faction mounts to all races.<br />

<br />
Noone wants to fly EVERYWEHERE to do all the dailes they can you know... dailey<br />
<br />
also Mounted Combat is an old thing to think about they prolly didnt know how the mechanics would work out untill they mastered the Vehicles<br />
<br />
also the Mounted combat thing would be awsome to use on any mount PvP servers with a mage vs hunter atop dragons flying above the clouds....<br />
<br />
first one to ground... well .... dies<br />
<br />
<br />
Also i think the Areana will be more of a Giant PvE type event maybee making it a quest chain and putting groups in there own world to accomplish it.<br />
<br />
Though at the same time i dont see how the titles of being the &quot;Exalted Hero of (w/e city)&quot; being used by every person in Azeroth<br />
<br />
Anyhow i think this is a genius idea to get us ready for a whole new ass kicking content Blizzard is ready to let us play with</div></div><hr />

Well Sadly all the Daily suck they all send you at Dragonblight/Crystalsong Howling Fjord etc.. to get item and all..<br />
<br />
Sorta sad hope next Phase will be more Daily in the Icecrown hub.<br />
<br />
Else Mounted Combat look Fun can't really tell server lag too much and its based on 4 abilities one melee one range 1 charge 1 block the 5 only used to ask duel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. They are vehicle versions of the city mounts.<br />
<br />
And it's not a &quot;kill yourself in front of Arthas&quot; thing either. It's more like a traditional medieval &quot;hey dude, how's that siege going that's pinning you in your castle? Us, we're having a blast using your lawn for sports to figure out which one of us gets to personally off you once you're done hiding like a baby.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Sounds pretty awesome. Might have to crank up the PTR tonight and go check out what's happening in Icecrown, eh.<br />
<br />
New content means more achievements. Now you too can spend even more time in-game striving for achievements that go beyond clearing Ulduar. Sneaky, sneaky Blizz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think of it like the banners that Valryn and Thrall carry when we do quests with them. That would be way tight to have ti be something that gives a group buff (exp+ buff? for level 80 people?) to damage or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arena doesn't necessarily mean death.<br />
Nowhere does it say arena in the blue post. It says Colosseum. Colosseum!= Arena. But you are right it doesn't mean death. It's for jousting and other knight related sports that were not about death. it was a simple sport to see who was the best of the best knight.</div></div><hr />

From World of Raids, You need to be exalted most likely before you can represent, no?<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think you need Exalted to represent them since you get to choose who to represent, but I know you can represent them all since one achievement is a meta to represent each faction :P so that's 5 more titles to add to the list and I got 17 titles already</div></div><hr />

Arena is a tiny room. A huge fuck off PvP fest sounds better than duels in boxes.</div></div><hr />
