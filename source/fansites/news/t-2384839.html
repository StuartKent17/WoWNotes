The Vulpera are a race of fox people that live in Vol'dun on Zandalar. <br />

Yeah Blizz, I'm sure everyone buys your excuse of &quot;better NPC customization&quot;.<br />

Ethereals: They have a problem for being hollow on the inside. Blizzard merged ethereals and high elves and got void elves instead.<br />
Naga: I also agree they could work. If the no legs is a problem, they could work like somewhat like worgen, have a second form for mounting, like night elf form.<br />
Tuskarr and Traunka: Doubt Taunka will come live after Highmountain tauren. Tuskarr are an open possibility, but not very probable.<br />
Mechagnomes / stone dwarves: I would love these to come live as well, the gnomes and dwarves before the curse of flesh.<br />
Ramkahen: They have four legs. Won't happen.<br />
Jinyu and Hozen: They might also come. They would fill the pandaren allied race slot.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you know what quality means...<br />

Nothing about Vulpera is &quot;aimed towards Korean / chinese people&quot; anymore than it is people in the U.S. / EU.<br />

And yes, if Blizzard wants to give Murlocs rich culture, lore, and playable character-level models - playable Murlocs.<br />

<br />
One of the various Ancients and forest beings that appeared to participate in the War of the Ancients in The Sundering was described as a tiny red fox with a sly — yet gnomish — visage.<br />
<br />
Page 186 from The Sundering<br />
<br />
<br />
The human glanced at his companion, who sat openmouthed. “He is. Forgive him! I find myself a little astounded<br />
by your coming as well…Cenarius.”<br />
“Cenarius…” muttered Jarod. “The forest lord?”<br />
“Yes, and I believe he’s brought some august company with him.” Rhonin added, peering beyond the mythic<br />
guardian.<br />
It was as if the tales of his childhood had come to life…and, indeed, perhaps that was the most apt description.<br />
Rhonin and the night elf gazed up—often high up—at giants known only from the dreams of mortals. For all his<br />
height, the forest lord was dwarfed by some of his companions. A pair of twin, bearlike creatures like veritable<br />
mountains flanked Cenarius, one eyeing Rhonin with particular interest. Beyond them and only slightly smaller, a<br />
being resembling a wolverine with six limbs and a serpentine tail eagerly surveyed the distant battlefield. His breath<br />
came in hungry pants and his massive claws raked the ground, creating massive grooves.<br />
Towering over almost everything else was a humongous, tusked boar with a mane of sharp, even deadly thorns. A<br />
name came unbidden from Rhonin’s early studies…Agamaggan…a demigod of primal fury…<br />
Some were not so overwhelming, but were no less stunning. There was a beautiful yet dangerous-looking bird<br />
woman around whom flocks of avians abounded. A tiny red fox with a sly yet gnomish visage scurried between the<br />
legs of the giants and darting around many of the demigods were minute, sword-wielding men with butterfly<br />
wings…pixies of a sort.<br />
<br />
<br />
So basically Rhonin and Jarod met Cenarius and other &quot;august&quot; entity aka demigods<br />
<br />
<br />
Hence if races like Centarus and Dryad came from Cenarius, we can suggest that Vulperas are descendents of this &quot;red fox&quot; demigod</div></div><hr />

Not a fox, but...<br />
<br />
They barely look similar other than being small (although I don't even think red pandas are very small) and carnivorans.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kemsa</div><div class="date">2018-03-19, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1- This is the time were new races can be introduce, we are going forward with the story of the World (no major threath YET!)<br />
2- Pandaren have backup lore since Warcraft 3 (Undead Campaing)- then they were explored further with the Pandaren Monk mercenary and Chen Stormstout helping in the founding of Orgrimmar<br />
3- Every MMO have something that satisfy the consumer, WoW is doing the same, with Vulpera being alongside of Worguen/Pandas/Tauren/saberon/SnakePeople/Saurok/arakoa/draconic/tortollan/orcs the idea to attract more with &quot;little&quot; &quot;cute&quot; warriors.<br />
4- Vulpera are using the Goblin skeleton and the questline will begin in Voldun (Horde territory), knowing this the &quot;possible&quot; coutnerpart race for the Alliance needs to be using the Worguen, as goblins are counterparts of Worguen, this is the problem because we dont know much of Allied races with this Skeleton other than Saberon and Saurok.<br />
5- Yes it would also make sense for the Vulpera being in the alliance so the Horde could get Saberon (makes everything more easy in terms of Politics arround the Horde &quot;the rule of the strongest&quot;)<br />
6- Ogres and Arakkoa are actually Unique Races with their unique Skeleton, wich means they being Allied Races &quot;NOW&quot; its not possible, it will make more sense to them to be a &quot;former&quot; new Race in a new Expansion, even tho Allied Races are not subraces the fact that they use the same assets of already existing races, makes the feel of another flavor of the same race. While Ogres and Arakkoa are actually unique in that aspect.<br />
7- we have 3 years + of BFA we can expect a lot of allied races for that time, new class combos and maybe a new class who knows, i can see Blizzard putting a lot of effort in this expansion already, like they want this one to be... (puts tinfoil hat) the last one.......</div></div><hr />

For some people, playable races can only be &quot;bad-asses&quot;, not nice, furry, intelectual or top model looking characters.<br />
WoW is an MMO, and it should satisfy all different costumers. As you like High Elves, there are people that like Vulpera.<br />

So just because its fantasy do that mean it should lower the quality of life of a product? Come on man.. Use your brain for a moment please. What is next? Murlocs being a playable? Just because it's a race in WoW DOESN'T MEAN IT FITS AS A PLAYABLE RACE !!!<br />
<br />
Dude! Check out Twitch's WoW channals and count how many Korean players are playing WoW. You really are sounding like a racist moron right now.<br />
<br />
And lowering their quality? Are you blind? Vulperas having the most work done on them. And already they're becoming a popular races, along with the Sethrok. Just because you have a problem with other real races playing WoW other then a white American, doesn't mean you can show it through by alienate a race in game.<br />
<br />
That's why Blizz shouldn't listen to idiots like you. Hell I hope they introduce a Black and Asian Human allies races for Alliance just to piss off players like you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jesus fucking christ man :O<br />
<br />
For someone who talks this much, you don't seem to know much, so I'll educate you.<br />
<br />
First, while I agree Elder Scrolls Online is not the best MMORPG out there, if you critize it's races, you also criticize Skyrim races, and, if anthropomorphic races makes for crappy games, you are saying that Skyrim, that is probably one of the most played RPGs in the 201x, is a crappy game.<br />
<br />
Second, Guild Wars 2? Seriously? Guild Wars 2 has scores of 9/10 on basically any review site and is one of the very few MMORPGs that decided to innovate on Wow's more traditional format.<br />
<br />
Third, Everquest, SERIOUSLY EVERQUEST? A CRAPPY MMORPG. Everquest has been around since 1999. Everquest is the foundation of all modern MMORPGs, mate.<br />
<br />
Finally, you seem to believe that this kind of characters is an eastern concept. Mate, you know nothing of western modern culture, do ya? Read on D&amp;D races, you'll see there's TONS of anthropomorphic races.</div></div><hr />

Yep, it sure does. A person that operates on logic and reason. One that doesn't make demands for a group of people to be playable on a faction that's already playable on another.<br />

There’s still the War campaign, it’d make sense that the Alliance get a Zandalar ally and the Horde get a Kul Tiras ally to give each other a foothold on the opposing island.<br />
<br />
Sethrak clearly aren’t planned to be playable and they’re too viscous for the Alliance. Vulpera are a slave race, slavery is practiced in the Horde. Even if it isn’t widespread.<br />

Vulpera would make more sense as Alliance, the only issue is that they’re on the Horde Island. Which the war campaign could address.<br />

Them being on Zandalar isn't &quot;the only issue.&quot; The issue is the Alliance ally themselves with the Sethrak, who eat and enslave Vulpera.<br />

Are you being serious now or just plain stupid AF? Yeah the Tauren was unique for WoW, however, that still doesn't change the fact that WoW gotten freaking PANDAS running around. If you care to even notice what is screaming obvious to any sane person there is:<br />
Elder Scrolls Online – Khajiit and Argonians <br />
Guild Wars 2 – Charr, ArcheAge – Firran, <br />
Everquest – Frogloks, Iksar, and Vah Shiir<br />
<br />
All of them freaking stupid AF, belonging in crappy MMORPGS, that nobody gives a fuck about anyway and let it stay that way! Korean / Chinese people can deal with that, but not in a modern MMORPG of .. and here it comes.. ready for it? CERTAIN QUALITY!<br />
<br />
Jesus fucking christ man :O<br />
<br />
So there is a certain quality to add various flavours of elves insteed?<br />
<br />
<br />
They fit the SAME category of stupid ass Korean character.. Look with your own eyes?!<br />
<br />
Perhaps you should look with your own eyes, the &quot;Korean&quot; mmo as you keep stating them mostly got no furry races what so ever. It's a western thing. Korean mmo want small loli girls with wierd cat or bunny ears. Else, please give me a list of each Korean mmo which got tons of furry races in them to prove me wrong. Also, one won't be enough, you will need several to actulley make your point true.<br />

And also, are you okey man? Do you like need to sit down for a bit or something?</div></div><hr />

That literally means nothing... Mag'har Orcs are already accounted for on the Alliance.<br />
Alliance got Kul'tiran Humans and Dark Iron Dwarves to Horde's Zandalari and Mag'har Orcs. <br />

<br />
ESO, Guild Wars 2, WoW, EverQuest, Camelot Unchained are all Western MMOs.<br />
<br />
ArcheAge &amp; Bless are Korean. So basically you're saying Western MMOs look more Korean than Korean MMOs?</div></div><hr />

I haven’t seen anything about Sethrak helping the Alliance on google.<br />
<br />
As for Vulpera, we use them against the Sethrak, we don’t recruit them. The Alliance might also help them for all we know, seeing as some quests are neutral as confirmed in the recent Q&amp;A.<br />

There’s a slaver near Orgrimmar, he has Naga, Vrykul and Taunka slaves if I remember correctly. There’s also that red ring which I think no longer exists. The Horde also enslave Kobolds in Stonetalon.<br />

Since we'll be on both continents when we hit 110, I'd bet we (Alliance) are going to save them from the Zandalari or something along those lines.

Seriously why does Blizzard find it so hard to imagine a new race that isn't just some fucking animal with human arms and legs? Orcs, Dwarves, Elves, even Trolls all were pre-established as fantasy races way before WoW. The only original shit Blizzard makes is this and the bloody Pandaren, what a shit show. Tauren were a mistake in the first place and their current importance to the lore reflects this.</div></div><hr />

Well it's just speculation on my part. But it would be a nice way to shut up naysayers, who don't want another cutesy race. And I doubt My little foxy friendship is magic would be popular on a snake filled desert in zandalar. It would make more sense for them to be violent and use their appearance for deception. Pplus their ears and size suggest they would be Goblin allied races. And the goblins aren't really nice people.</div></div><hr />

Other way around. Horde questing has them saving them and befriending them in game. If they were to become an player race, they'd almost certainly be Horde. The highly speculative thought has been Sethrak as a potential ally to the Alliance and foil to the Vulpera.</div></div><hr />

Bolded for emphesis.<br />
<br />
The American made Elder Scrolls, D&amp;D inspired, very Western Style RPG's target audience with Kajit is China and Korea? <br />
<br />
You are aware of the Elder Scrolls series, yes? That it isn't just Elder Scrolls online?<br />
Arena(1994), Daggerfall (1996), Morrowind(2002), Oblivion (2006) and Skyrim (2011).<br />
<br />
Kajit and Argonians have been in that series since Arena. I'm pretty sure Bethesda weren't gunning for the Asian market with a extremely Western RPG in 1994 when Square ruled the market. I'm not sure you could've even obtained copies of Arena and Daggerfall in Korea and China in the 90s, if you even had a PC to begin with, even Morrowind would've likely been dicey sales wise in China in 2002.<br />
<br />
But no, everyone's calling you out on your crap, and instead of taking it on the chin, &quot;Everyone is stoopid!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grocalis</div><div class="date">2018-03-19, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone that works very heavily with the models behind the scenes in Machinema, there are a few notes on Vulpera that make it up in the air whether they will be playable or not.<br />
<br />
You see, there are two types of main models you will find in the files. &quot;Character&quot; and &quot;Creature&quot;. Character models are the ones that are built to work with the games gearing system, allowing customized gear options and such. Creature models don't have any link to those systems, and are instead &quot;stand alone&quot; in their designs, though they too can have some private customization, like the Nightborne creature models used in Legion have a lot of Nightborne only armor sets under their own unique &quot;geosets&quot;. Character is where all the playable and some common NPCs are situated, while creature is where all the monsters, most bosses, and even lore characters are located including Anduin, Baine, Sylvanas, etc.<br />
<br />
Why Vulpera might be playable...<br />
<br />
There are a few NPC models located in the character folder, like Vrykul, Tuskarr, Skeletons, Ice Trolls, etc... However, all of these models, as they are not used by players, have some very noticeable limitations in customization. For instance, pretty much all of them don't have female variants (even Vrykul, as the Vrykul female is located under the creature area mentioned earlier, and thus less customizable.), have no extra face textures, or even have missing armor geosets (the vast majority of them don't have cape geosets). Vuplera, on the other hand, does not have these limitations. They have full facial customization, both genders, and all armor geosets, including the capes. They are well above and beyond the average NPC race when it comes to these factors.<br />
<br />
Why Vulpera might not be playable.<br />
<br />
Limited bone structure. One thing of note on the latest version of the models, is that all of them have a pretty consistent rig map. For instance, the brow has 9 main bones. Two for the forehead, three on each main brow, and one for the center of the brow. Lips use 12, 6 on the top and bottom, 3 each side starting from the middle to the outer. While some get extra bones, like the orcs have a bone located between the lips and nose to help deform them better, it's very rare to have a playable with less bones. The Vulpera though, have much more limited facial bones, like the brow only have 5, while the lips have 6. That is a very large reduction in what expressions they can use and is closer to the NPC models in the folder, like the Vrykul only has around 6 facial bones, period.<br />
<br />
It that a killer to them being playable? Not really, as I mentioned, it's very rare that playables have less bones, but not without merit, as the night elf female has no eye bones (making her a big oddity when it comes to the newer models), and they still have way more then the other NPCs located in the folder.<br />
<br />
My guess is that Vulpera will be added as playable down the line around the same time we finally get the goblin and worgen updates. The Vulpera are actually using a skeleton that I can already tell is going to be used on the newest goblin models for the most part, so it makes sense they are getting a lot of attention. However, I don't think they will be faction specific. Blizzard seems to be focusing on each faction having a racial connection for each Allied Race. (Void Elves are the only real oddity in that design), and it makes sense to me that the Vulpera may be in the end connected to the Pandaren as a sort of neutral allied race. It seems like the best fit as we already have 1:1 parity on the other allied races, now that Kul Tirans are pretty much confirmed to be the counterpoint to Mag'har Orcs.</div></div><hr />

We can argue semantics all we want. Human, Braided, Animal, I don't care. The point stands: Vulpera have no hair options. Something that no other race has. That's huge. <br />
<br />
In the past every race has had some sort of &quot;Hair&quot; customization option. That's gone. Their customization comes from other places. Which I think opens the door for a lot of possibilities. Like Ethereal, for example. (to be clear, I don't particularly want playable ethereal, but its a good example)</div></div><hr />

Allow me to quote you a little Muradin here:<br />
<br />
&quot;My older brother Magni is king of the dwarves.&quot;<br />
&quot;My younger brother Brann is a renowned explorer.&quot;<br />
&quot;If I didn't kick so much ass, I'd feel a tad awkward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Let's not forget they're rough, tough, fighting, drinking, tank driving, bear wrestling, treasure hunting, mountain carving badasses.<br />

Also, the beards. Damn those glorious beards...</div></div><hr />

Let's dispell some myths and logical fallacies. <br />
<br />
<br />
1. Vulpera don't fit into the lore<br />
Says who? A random nobody on a forum? They'll have lore and the Horde will encounter them in BfA, same as the Nightborne. <br />
<br />
2. They'll attract Furries!!<br />
Ok, and? This game always did. Furries are just people whom enjoy anthropomorphic animals. <br />
<br />
3. They'll attract sexual deviants!!!!!!!!1111<br />
Ok... so you're seeing something sexual in the Vulpera, but am concerned they'll attract sexual attention whilst there's races like Draenei, Blood Elves, Night Elves, Nightborne, Void Elves and humans in the game? Sorry, but the &quot;Furry&quot; races tend to be pretty damned absent from ERP hotspots, Draenei being the exception since most people are seemingly unaware that they fulfill the Furry qualities. There are far more non-Furries doing sexual things with WoW races, where's your concern about those?<br />
<br />
4. They're too cute!!!!111<br />
Um, they're not overly cute nor sexualized, you sure you're not exposing your personal feelings here? <br />
<br />
5. They don't fit into the Warcraft universe!!!!<br />
Again, says you, a random nobody with an opinion.<br />
The developers and writers of the game decide such things, and they've added anthropomorphic pigs, monkeys, hyenas, rats, cows, goats, fish, pandas, bears, wolverines, walrus, Bison, Owls, Cats, snakes... So sorry, but if you're concerned with playing a game that's not &quot;Furry fuel&quot;, then you're playing the wrong fucking game.</div></div><hr />

This. Over and over again. The game has ancient beings based on animals, each of which has a race associated with it. This is Warcraft Lore, not Western Lore, Chinese Lore, or anything else. Warcraft. The creators of this world can explain and create anything they please. Those of you who think they should exclude a race because it's not what you personally want need to put more effort into creating your own game so you can play as just humans as much as you want.</div></div><hr />

No, alliance has the void, hence void elves. Seriously though couldn't they make Gnolls playable at least? Not this cutesy Vulpera lol. Blizz will definitely make money off this race of they're playable though. Too many people like cute crap!</div></div><hr />

I would remove everything from the first list except for furbolgs, murlocs, naga, draknoid, saurok, and arakkoa.<br />

The &quot;furry&quot; association is not the problem, it's all in the visual design. The races I didn't list are badly designed.</div></div><hr />

Excuse my blundering idiocy, I forgot to take into consideration the fact that someone would inevitable make this comment, and typed &quot;furry&quot; instead of &quot;animal&quot; races. My apologies, my dear nitpicky sir.<br />
<br />
But real talk, it doesn't really matter if they're playable or not, because the biggest complaint I've seen is &quot;they shouldn't be in the game&quot;. Like just get over yourselves, wow isn't a grim-dark GoT game. It's often full of lighthearted fun and silly poop quests, as well as some pretty serious topics like death and such. <br />

You don't seem to understand that the team for designing Allied Races very likely has nothing to do with any of the things you mentioned.. But, okay.

And you fail to understand that i speak about the gaming industry as a whole, and activision in particular. <br />
I mean, google microtransactions and lootboxes and see how my fantasy world is pretty real.<br />
<br />
And for wow in particular, tell me why we can't have new tier set armor but 9 new reskinned model &quot;races&quot; ? :)</div></div><hr />

For the most part the allied races are just different tribes or evolutions of races already in the game. Shouldn't they just be a new race?

<br />
Because Blizzard got tired of being called out on how lazily they designed Set Bonuses and finally decided to can Tier in general. Pretty sure they've said there will be new armor sets per Raid as well, anyways.</div></div><hr />
