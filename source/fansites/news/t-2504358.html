Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Azshara’s Eternal Palace<br />
<br />
Queen's Court<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where casting either Moonfire or Regrowth twice in a row while affected by Repeat Performance (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/304409-repeat-performance) was not triggering the silence.<br />
Fixed a bug on Mythic difficulty where the damage effect from Deferred Sentence (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/304128-deferred-sentence) could trigger the healing reduction from Obey or Suffer (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/297585-obey-or-suffer) right as the decrees transitioned between each other.<br />
<br />
Queen Azshara<br />
<br />
When either Aethenel or Cyranus is slain on Normal, Heroic, or Mythic difficulty, there is now a 3-second delay before the other one gains the Torment (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/297912-torment) buff.<br />
Azshara's Indomitable (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/155354-azsharas-indomitable) is now summoned 10 seconds later than previously observed on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Tidemistresses have 5% less health on Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Siege of Boralus <br />
<br />
Corrected an issue where players’ pets were unable to attack the tentacles during the Viq’Goth encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Vitality Conduit (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/299959-vitality-conduit) (Essence) correctly transfers health from a target with absorb shields on them.<br />
Learning new ranks of Conflict and Strife (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303868-conflict-and-strife) (Essence) should now properly grant achievements such as Power Up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
