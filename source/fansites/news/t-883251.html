We’ve been following discussions and reading feedback on the Dungeon Finder Call to Arms feature, and appreciate everyone’s opinions on the topic. We wanted to share a few items though that supplement the recent announcement:<br />
<br />
The additional reward for completing the Dungeon Finder Call to Arms (called the Satchel of Exotic Mysteries) will be Bind on Account; able to be freely sent to other characters on your account once you receive it.<br />
<br />
An error existed in the announcement regarding flasks and potions being picked based on your spec. This is not the case. If someone earns a Satchel of Exotic Mysteries, and if it rolls the random chance to provide a potion or flask, it will be a randomly selected. This helps ensure a broad array of available flasks and potions for all characters.<br />
<br />
We also wanted to clarify, mounts that have a possibility to be found in a Satchel of Exotic Mysteries are found with the same rarity as if you had slain the dungeon boss that normally drops them.</div></div><hr />

nah jk :P loving this so far even if im a DPS :) lots of people say that being a tank isnt worth it because everyone always blames them adn the healer first so this will hopefully persuade a few people to return to tanking ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
How, exactly, does it screw them? They will have absolutely nothing less than they do now, except maybe for queue times. Lack of reward != punishment.<br />
<br />
Also, maybe they could learn to heal or tank instead of qq'ing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If someone has 4 level 85's and they are only pure DPS classes then it is their problem. Everyone should have at least a tank or a healer simply so they can see another facet of the game. <br />
<br />
To be honest, I have never met anyone with alts that hasn't rolled a healer or a tank class at some point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bullshit. Under normal tank and spank conditions yeah, but thats not the case 80% of the time. We have other things to do apart from just hitting a boss.<br />
<br />
(Coming from someone playing melee dps for 4 years, tank for 2 and healer for 1,5.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right well this is cac then.<br />
First of all, the de-incentivise from running with the guild when they have just put in place a complex guild system ?<br />
<br />
And now those mounts will drop at the same rate as the dungeons they are found in ?<br />
Sorry but i'd rather farm stratholme for 20 mins than farm heroics which can potentially take 2 hours....</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. No it doesn't.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is that this entire system was designed to encourage tanks and healers to queue so that DPS will get shorter queue times. <br />
<br />
Besides, if the rewards are good enough, eventually, this will bring LFG's ratios of DPS to Tanks to Healers to 3:1:1, which would result in an instaque for everyone. My only concern is that they didn't make the rewards good enough to actually entirely fix the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Still, great clarifications by Blizzard. I'm excited for this change for both my DPS characters and Tanking characters.</div></div><hr />

If you only have a DPS then you will only see faster queue times. At the current wait times, this is your improvement.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Durandro</div><div class="date">2011-04-08, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Slightly better, but still not great.<br />
<br />
If they wanted it slightly improved again, then pure DPS classes (Rogues, Hunters, etc) should get a small bonus as well. Not as big, but a little token gift due to their lack of choice. Maybe even just 10% more bonus gold from completing the dungeon.</div></div><hr />

I for one would not be happy with there being no 'pure' dps around. So this smacks of silliness. Telling someone to reroll or shut up when there's imbalance is just...well, bigotted really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it doesn't you fucking idiot, it encourages people to play other characters. You now have the choice to either play your pure DPS class and get considerably quicker que times than now, or you can choose to play another character but still get the benefits of using a tank/healer sent to your pure DPS class.<br />
<br />
The qq never stops does it?<br />

People who have not suffered the horrors of tanking and healing don't deserve nice things :P<br />

I've tanked and healed for 5 years on my Druid before Blizzard destroyed the class in Cata, so I'm on my Rogue now. Your argument is invalid.</div></div><hr />

Nope, you get faster queues as DPS, that's the whole point of those changes. How ignorant can people be?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lvlark</div><div class="date">2011-04-08, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So.. if there's, say, 15 rare mounts to be had this way, all with a 1% drop chance (overgeneralising here to make computation easier) the chance you'd get at least one rare mount is, assuming a seperate roll is performed for each and every of those 15 mounts, 1-(0.99^15)*100%=14%!!!<br />
In fact, there's a 1% chance that you'd get 2 or more mounts on a run. Heck it's even possible to get that lucky guildie see 3 mounts on his/her first tank run.</div></div><hr />

Not, but we're not gaining anything either, which tanks will. They will continue to do the same thing they've always done, but now they get free stuff on top of that. And the queue times are NOT that long, it's much quicker than having to look for a group through trade like before 3.LFD</div></div><hr />

I agree on the first point. On the second I have to make a point that two of the mounts drop from heroic instances, thus you're currently limited to one try per day.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenixphyre</div><div class="date">2011-04-08, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What most people fail to understand is that it is not a &quot;Lack&quot; of tank or healers, but the way dungeons and raids are set up. Standard 25 man raid composition consists of 2 tanks, 5-6 healers and 17-18 DPS. By these numbers alone you will inherently see the issue with why you have a long wait time. This is how the game has always been and will always be. Blizzard is simply trying to improve the model currently in place to benefit everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard are forcing us to choose herbalism if we want herbs this is unfair! And how come I can't get ore out of rocks without mining?<br />
<br />
If you want the additional loot, role a tanking class. I'm not really seeing how that's forcing you to do it though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

There are lots of things that tanks have which you don't. Like for example, the ability to tank. Stop being selfish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So because I didnt see random prizes coming to people who can tank and heal and because i picked and leveled classes i liked to play over classes that can tank/heal i dont get some prizes? So i would now have to level a tank/healer to get some of the coveted prizes. That to me doesnt seem like a message blizz would want to send. I'm fine with my 20 min ques. There are dailies to do auctions to undercut people to talk to. That was a fine downside for me. But now telling me i dont get extra prizes because i picked classes i like to play over classes that can tank/heal is messed up.<br />
<br />
What about the new people to the game. Who bought the game and said&quot; i want a warlock&quot;. And it is their only lvl 85 toon atm. That person would now have to level another toon to get these perks. Now i know there are altoholics out there but i cant stand leveling. I have 2 85s and 3 other toons stuck at random levels cause leveling gets so boring. Im still spending money on the game just like everyone else whether i level another toon or not. So why should I be made to level another class to 85 if i want these perks?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ttrinity</div><div class="date">2011-04-08, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing they could think about is creating new ways to improve gear other than just grinding dungeons. <br />
<br />
How about giving more JP/VP to those DPS who wait in queue longer, a point a minute? 2 points? How about allowing dps with longer queue times than 5 minutes get a bag of goodies too? Although it seems like they are trying to address this issue, the lack of creativity of throwing out stuff to scarce classes participating is short sighted and seems to be a temporary fix.<br />

As a healer and with the new guild system, we pretty much stay in house. A &quot;Chance&quot; at a mount is not motivation to delve into the land of pugginess these days.</div></div><hr />

Maybe so but now there will be more incentive for people who don't tank/heal to do it and try it. DPS gets quicker queues which is what has been the QQ of the century since LFD came out.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I guess it does. I mean i can't imagine any benefit to being able to get into a dungeon 5 minutes after queuing vs the 30-40 we have now.<br />
<br />
If you're still not convinced, try tanking? Bear tank is pretty fun to play and not too hard on a rotation standpoint. Then if you manage to get a mount in your sack, it's BOA and you transfer it to your main class.<br />
<br />
There is no reason to complain about this change.</div></div><hr />

Yes this is a band-aid, not a pure fix. but nevertheless, be happy they are addressing it finally. <br />
This will help alot of Dps'ers get into dungouns a little faster until somthing more permanant can be acheived.<br />

Now i know there are altoholics out there but i cant stand leveling. I have 2 85s and 3 other toons stuck at random levels cause leveling gets so boring. Im still spending money on the game just like everyone else whether i level another toon or not. So why should I be made to level another class to 85 if i want these perks?<br />
<br />
While you're at it, why should you have to roll a druid if you want the perk of being able to shapeshift! Others have the perks and I want them too, and I'm being forced to do something else to get them! QQQQQ!<br />
<br />
Dear DPS, we're not being punished, unless you call not having to sit around in a queue as long - punishment.<br />
<br />
Also, BoA bags is awesome, and may actually get me to tank so that I can send the mounts around to my alts!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Dear DPS,<br />
In an effort to stop the merciless onslaught of DPS whining about long queues, Bliz is trying to bribe tanks and healers to carry your a$$es through heroics, and what is your response? WHAAAAAAA WHAT DO WE GET?!?!?! The answer is so simple, you get what you have been whining about since expansion dropped: shorter queues. Not enough? ROLL A TANK OR HEALER.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Now let me say that I think this change will initially cause more problems than it solves, as there will surely be a ton of plate wearers trying to switch specs and be bad, not to mention the other unique ways this will be exploited ... some of which are already being tossed around. I still don't think that geared or skilled tanks will think the satchel is worth the trouble of spoon feeding heroics to bad dps.</div></div><hr />

Heroics ARE T'n'S. <br />
All tanks can interrupt now. And at this stage of gear progression CC isn't even needed anymore unless you have a freshly dinged 333 Tank/Heal.<br />

Not everyone enjoys playing death knights. Why should we be forced to play a class we don't like to get additional loot? <br />
I still see this change as a lazy ass bandage on a wound that doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
Then why are you crying like you just got stabbed in the sensitive parts?<br />
<br />
<br />
Moreover, you're not being forced to play another class or spec you don't like for extra loot. Everything that drops from the satchel is attainable outside of level 85 heroics, often with considerable less effort.<br />
<br />
While that random tank or healer spends 30-60 min getting his satchel (risking that his group won't be able to complete the instance and all that time is wasted) you can easliy farm 4-5 flasks or all three dungeons that drop the mounts, regardless what your class is. If you sign up for a heroic because you want points, your queue times just got shortened by X minutes because of this change, which means you'll have those X minutes to spend on other stuff. <br />
<br />
The tank or healer signing gets extra stuff BECAUSE he's signing, which most of them normally wouldn't have. that's their gain.<br />
You as a dps get a shorter queue which you normally wouldn't have gotten. that's your gain.<br />
<br />
win/win?</div></div><hr />

While that probably will happen, either the new tanks will fail so badly that you'll kick them, they won't get their goody bag and they'll give up, or they won't fail badly enough that that you have to boot them, they'll finish (and so will you) and they'll (hopefully) learn along the way and get better for their next run. Sure, you might not see them again, but the person that you see the next time will probably be fresh out of a different dungeon where the same thing happened. Eventually they'll get better.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they wanted it slightly improved again, then pure DPS classes (Rogues, Hunters, etc) should get a small bonus as well. Not as big, but a little token gift due to their lack of choice. Maybe even just 10% more bonus gold from completing the dungeon.<br />
Most people choose a spec rather than a class when they create their toons. Just because there is a tanking tree attached to the class that somebody chose which they had no intention of using when they created the toon and there isn't on yours, that makes you more entitled to the bonus?</div></div><hr />

Anyway, the rewards from this satchel are very insignificant anyway. The DPS has the greater reward for, A) having the easiest role in the group and most stress-free, and B) having reduced queue times to boot.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see you come up with a plan that alleviates queue times but retains the formula that has proven to be successful for WoW, a formula that sets it apart from other MMOs.</div></div><hr />

Ever thought people do heroics for fun? Honestly, I think a majority of the stories of bad pug experiences in the heroics are made up BS full of exaggeration. On the topic of mount farming, you know why more will queue for heroics instead of just farming the mounts from there initial dungeons? Because other then Stratholme the others you can only do 1 time per day!

because which is easier, solo farming MT for the mount on my lock, doing the stupid quest line for the key to kara to farm that mount on my alt mage or just face roll healing heroics with my druid?... not to mention while healing heroics i'll also be earning rep, jp's, and possible gear upgrades...<br />

This is still like being punished for playing the class I enjoy. It has nothing to do with responsibility. The fact that its BoA means nothing if you don't have a tank class and I'm not going to play a class I don't enjoy for a chance at the bag. Give my mage a tank spec and I'll start tanking. Otherwise it is not happening. Also having the same drop chance as the bosses normally would means nothing, because you can farm the bags nonstop everyday all week.<br />

Nope, no huge reduction will be forthcoming. Their will be far, far too many DPS in relation to tanks and healers in the queue still.<br />

<br />
In Wrath I ran my main to gear up both specs and then I ran with my alt to gear both specs. This expansion I barely run a dungeon, I maybe avg 3 a week and on my alt I have yet to run it. I am contempt just keeping him in full Pvp gear which seems to outperform a full set of 346 gear anyways. <br />

In the end the player base needs to stop QQ'ing, they asked for harder dungeons and longer length of dungeons, long Q times is the result of this.</div></div><hr />

The core problem behind tanking is that it's a leadership role. You are expected to lead the pug, know the fights, and when there's a wipe, unless it's obviously someone else's fault, it's yours by default.<br />
<br />
So, want to improve the number of tanks? Change the leadership role. My suggestion is to give some classes extra utility features and make them &quot;pullers,&quot; a new role that must be filled in all 5-man groups. Pullers could have some of the responsibility of tanks without actually being the ones getting hit. Dungeons could then be designed around pullers marking foes, splitting off sub-groups and marking the ground to indicate where the party should fight. Of course, they'd need to also have passable DPS, but they don't have to be on-par with pure DPS... perhaps just a notch above tanks.<br />
<br />
Raids could then be structured to require 2-3 pullers per raid so that it's not just a dungeon role.... they might even get some nice dual PvE/PvP features (essentially enhanced CC in exchange for their lower dps).<br />
<br />
By breaking up the leadership role in dungeons, you will improve the lot of every player. Don't just give pullers all of the leadership role that tanks had, and perhaps don't even require pullers until heroics. That way, it's something that you expect to have to learn to do well before you just jump into it.</div></div><hr />

They will have absolutely nothing less than they do now, except maybe for queue times. Lack of reward != punishment.<br />
<br />
Also, maybe they could learn to heal or tank instead of qq'ing.<br />
<br />
As a pure DPS... I feel the want to elaborate on the &quot;screwing&quot; of us. As a mage, i don't have the ability to tank or heal. As a raid geared mage, Justice Points don't mean much for me (even with the Honor conversion coming) and to a lesser extent, Valor Points don't mean much to me either (The Conquest Conversion may change that). Which means that lower queue times hold little value to me. Rare mounts and vanity pets are something that interest me. Yes I can farm them myself, but that's not the point. A pure DPS is hardly ever going to see the Call To Arms. Therefore they have the normal drop chance for the mounts listed in the original CTA post. Tanks (who will have the highest potential benefit from this) have the chance to get the mounts or pets in the CTA bag and the chance for them if said tank goes farming. Same can be said for the healer class (though they may not see the benefits as much).<br />
<br />
In essence, I guess saying that this &quot;screws&quot; the DPS is not correct. You do point out that DPS loses nothing from this, but the gain vs. what the other roles gain is out of balance. I know there are plenty of DPS out there like me who won't really care about the lower queue time so they will see this as a loss on our part. <br />
<br />
What remains to be seen is if this will actually make things any better overall. Sure it brings more tanks and healers to the queue (in theory), but what about the quality of these individuals? Are we going to see a plethora of quality players? Personally, I don't think we will. We are going to see the hybrids think they can tank or heal just because there is a chance at a nifty reward. Top that with the fact that the CTA role must queue solo... it doesn't seem like a good fix. I don't see tanks queue solo hardly at all. Most of them are running guild stuff for the XP and/or rep. Healers may queue solo, but in my experience, most of them queue with friends or guild mates for the same reason.<br />
<br />
Finally, You suggest the pure DPS could stop the crying and whining and learn to tank or heal. That's an acceptable idea, but it leads to the same problem of non quality players going in just for the reward. I would also mention a personal philosophy when it comes to playing different roles. In this game (and really any MMORPG) there are going to be those people who are naturally talented at playing any role they want. There are also a large number of people (myself included) who are talented at playing one role and rather fail at the others. Regardless of the time and effort put into learning a different role, it doesn't end in any form of success. So trying to push someone who is a pure DPS into a different role is not likely going to be met with success. <br />
<br />
In the end, pure DPS are not really screwed, but we are not given the same chance at a reward that the other roles are for simply playing that role. To me, if this works and the queue times are reduced, the only ones that benefit from this change are under geared alts or players that are way behind the curve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At a quick stab, I think the best puller candidates would be:<br />
<br />
Surv. Hunter<br />
Arcane Mage<br />
Subt. Rogue<br />
Frost DK<br />
Demo Lock<br />
<br />
That gives some extra play-style options to those classes and provides a nice, diverse set of types of pullers including a ranged physical, two melee and two casters as well as having two pet classes in the mix. Lots of variety and because only one of those classes has a non-DPS spec, you're not removing any major playstyle options, just minor variations (yes, you won't be a DW DK as a DPS spec anymore, but that's a relatively small price to pay).</div></div><hr />

My suggestion, stop making bad suggestions. Especially after calling a good idea bad. And in cata heroics it is often the dps or healers fault when a group wipes. I.e. not keeping their cc up, leaving every single interrupt to the tank who has low hit, and just being a bad healer (of course even these can't cause my groups to wipe because of my awesomeness). Also can you not read what other people are writing? Clearly having to lead is not deterring most from running their tank alts often. I bet you're a hunter and you md and pull before the tank does.</div></div><hr />

&quot;QQ queues are long I want faster queues&quot; <br />
<br />
We all know every fix to speed up the queue timer will get something 'negative' for the dps. Tanking isn't hard at all, you just need to get some time to learn it. An excellent way of doing that is doing the NORMAL versions of the dungeons BEFORE the heroics. Now with this fix almost no one of the ignorant dps see their queue time shortened, but now they want their precious goodie bag.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Titoselfire</div><div class="date">2011-04-08, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, heres to all the DPS'ers that are going to QQ all day about these changes<br />
below u will find a little picture, to give a little insight on how stuff is going now and how it will go in the future,<br />
currently, the queue just fills up slows untill complete groups are found, and than u get a message and than the next group will pop up<br />
with '' groups in progress'' probably intervening, but i have no clue how that works in this proces, anyway<br />
<br />
u see 3 groups, and that is what is mostly causing the time u need to wait. (--&gt; img822.imageshack.us/i/newdungeonsystem.jpg)<br />
DPS stack up, stack up, Stack up, and the ratio versus actual tanks and healers available in a certain amount of time, u will get 4-65 minutes estimated wait time, <br />
<br />
with this new idea, they would ask the people in Group 3, which has an offspec healer, to be placed in a group thats ready to go for apart from 1 specific role, if he gives up his dps role and fills in the one required (Tank from group1, Tank or Healer for group2)<br />
<br />
in the end, if all of those 3 decide to take the demand, the whole 3rd queue group will dissapear and 2 complete groups will be ready to go. in return for giving up their DPS role, and taking more responsibilty, theyll be granted a little reward.<br />
<br />
<br />
hope that clarifies it a bit, and yeah, this is probably an attempt to make people pick up a role that needs a little more focus, i mean, everyone can Dps while drunk or stoned...or even be completly blind<br />
i do have to say, that if someone gets a question to do the Call to Arms version of the dungeon, that person needs a certain level of gear for their spec (a.i minimum of itemlevel 345+)<br />
<br />
anyway, im so gonna enjoy this, thank u blizzard!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I invite you to explain where I said any such thing.<br />
<br />
I don't think this will help, but I don't think it's not worth trying.<br />
<br />
<br />
And in cata heroics it is often the dps or healers fault when a group wipes.<br />
<br />
You're talking about groups that have already formed. Those are ignorable. The problem with tanks is that there aren't enough of them. Why? Because there's a gigantic ramp-up to being a good tank, and most get discouraged and stop. If the ramp-up were decreased by reducing the leadership role of tanks, that problem would be solved. Please note that my suggestion doesn't make TANKING any easier. The actual act of keeping agro during a fight and not dying is still where it was, and is the tanks primary concern now and under my suggestion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also can you not read what other people are writing? Clearly having to lead is not deterring most from running their tank alts often. I bet you're a hunter and you md and pull before the tank does.<br />
<br />
Ad hominem statements don't help to make your case. Also, I disagree with your premise that the complaints about this change are indicative of the reason tanks don't get played. I will point out that one of the most experienced tanks in the game agrees that it's the leadership role that dissuades tanks (http://tanklikeagirl.com/blog/2011/04/07/call-to-fail/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TankLikeAGirl+%28Tank+like+a+girl%29&amp;utm_content=Google+Reader)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because dpsing enough to ensure that a boss dies before enrage isn't important. Even bosses without enrage, the longer he's up, the less mana your healer has. So tired of seeing high and mighty healers/tanks who think their role is harder/more important than a dps'es.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sprinky</div><div class="date">2011-04-08, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its the perfect solution to the problem. If your main is a pure dps class and you so badly want those mounts then you can solo farm them easily anyway. If you needed that little extra motivation to level a tank or healer alt then this could be it. And if you are a pure dps that already had/doesnt care about the mounts then you will get faster queue times. <br />
<br />
In my opinion any pure dps that isnt happy with this change is actually completely stupid. If you complain about long queue times, then also complain when they make a clearly balanced fix to that, and you dont offer any better ideas to fix the problem, you really should take a long hard look at yourself.</div></div><hr />

No, no it won't. Because when everyone runs to play his/her tank or healer alt, the dps will get the Call to Arms. Besides that, you also get much shorter queues, which is what all the pure dpsers wanted. Win win situation.</div></div><hr />

You see, part of the self fulfillment things that a tank can do is to solo the same instances that drop these mounts. We’ve been doing it for years now.<br />
But now that we’re on the subject, you may want to add Attumen’s mount to that list Blizz. It’s not much harder to farm than all others.</div></div><hr />

This just goes to show that some people are die hard pessimists. They will find the negative in anything even when there is a LAGRE positive staring them right in the face.<br />
<br />
It is obviously in regards to gaining something good. I have not complained about a single change through out my entire time playing WoW, so do not assume you know me and call me a pessimist. There is absolutely ZERO positive and plenty of negative in this to me. I do not care about the queue times as I said so what do I gain? There are already so many bad tanks to deal with and now there is going to be way more. Now tanks will get unlimited chances at the mount drops that I only get 1 chance per lockout. To claim any of this is fair is ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a pure DPS'er I actually have to agree with the guy you quoted. A single dps has the least responsibility in any 5 man group. If I slack off a bit, it doesn't necessarily hurt the group overall. <br />
<br />
Where I agree with you, is that each role in a 5 man is as important as the other. If the group has a crap tank, no amount of DPS or Healing will save it. If the group has a crap healer, no amount of tanking and DPS is going to save it. If the group has 3 crap DPS, no amount of tanking and healing is going to pull you through.</div></div><hr />

How does the dropchance for the mounts work?<br />
Is it like (example) 1% to get a mount at all and then again another roll for which mount you will get?<br />
Or do we have (example) 3 mounts with a droprate of 1% each so that the chance to get any mount sums up to 3%?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It isn't &quot;screwing&quot; anyone over unless you're a self entitled kid that doesn't understand why this is being done in the first place.<br />
<br />
This is to give tanks more of an incentive to queue up and reduce the queue times for you as a DPS class, nothing more. It is your fault for choosing to play a pure DPS, and only a pure DPS (and for the record, I only play a Mage). If you really want the bag, than roll a tank class and add another tank to the queue, which is precisely what Blizzard wants you to do. No offense, but you aren't owed, nor do you deserve everything Blizzard puts out, especially when there is a very clear intent with these bags.<br />
<br />
This is bar none the best thing Blizzard could have done. Now people that typically play DPS have the opportunity to not queue up with their DPS, and instead queue up as a tank instead, reducing the number of DPS in the queue and increasing the tanks at the same time, while STILL giving their main the opportunity to reap the rewards. Very good decision on Blizzards part.</div></div><hr />

So Blizzard doesn't cater to the minority out there that &quot;only roll a pure dps class&quot;, so fucking what. Cry me a fucking river. This game isn't about you. The things that Blizzard does to improve their game are not about YOU they're about making the game better for the majority out there.<br />

You aren't. I have three healers, and the rest dps. I'm a ranged player at heart. No interest in tanking. I still dont like this reward a person approach. Yes yes que gets lowered, big deal. Still doesn't mean you'll finish the dungeon successfully, or that the game is any more or less fun.<br />
<br />
I love it how it's &quot;our&quot; fault for playing the class we enjoy playing. Our fault for wanting to have fun in this game. Perhaps there is something about healing or tanking that isn't that fun...why not focus on that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest, I have never met anyone with alts that hasn't rolled a healer or a tank class at some point.<br />
<br />
You haven't seen me then, i play dps only, simply cause i cant heal, i wouldnt get my hc finished if i had to heal, so give satchel to everyone in the dungeon plox, everything else is retarded imo</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wilderness</div><div class="date">2011-04-08, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In essence, I guess saying that this &quot;screws&quot; the DPS is not correct. You do point out that DPS loses nothing from this, but the gain vs. what the other roles gain is out of balance. I know there are plenty of DPS out there like me who won't really care about the lower queue time so they will see this as a loss on our part.<br />
It is not a loss if someone else gains something.<br />
<br />
What remains to be seen is if this will actually make things any better overall. Sure it brings more tanks and healers to the queue (in theory), but what about the quality of these individuals? Are we going to see a plethora of quality players? Personally, I don't think we will. We are going to see the hybrids think they can tank or heal just because there is a chance at a nifty reward. Top that with the fact that the CTA role must queue solo... it doesn't seem like a good fix. I don't see tanks queue solo hardly at all. Most of them are running guild stuff for the XP and/or rep. Healers may queue solo, but in my experience, most of them queue with friends or guild mates for the same reason.<br />
How much of an improvement this will be is definitely unknown. I’m pretty sure it will have a positive effect on queue times but it definitely might not be a big one. Having more hybrids, or alts, go tank or heal because they are interested in the rewards is not a bad thing. Sure, some of them might not be that great it. But those that are bad will just get replaced, or learn to be better. And some of them will be decent, so overall that means more people will be tanking and healing than were doing so previously, and that is a good thing.<br />
<br />
Finally, You suggest the pure DPS could stop the crying and whining and learn to tank or heal. That's an acceptable idea, but it leads to the same problem of non quality players going in just for the reward. I would also mention a personal philosophy when it comes to playing different roles. In this game (and really any MMORPG) there are going to be those people who are naturally talented at playing any role they want. There are also a large number of people (myself included) who are talented at playing one role and rather fail at the others. Regardless of the time and effort put into learning a different role, it doesn't end in any form of success. So trying to push someone who is a pure DPS into a different role is not likely going to be met with success.<br />
You are only considering the negatives without balancing that with the positives. While obviously there will be some bad players who will re-spec or re-roll a tank/healer for this reward, there just as obviously will be good players who will do so as well, or people who are bad will learn how to do it better.<br />
<br />
In the end, pure DPS are not really screwed, but we are not given the same chance at a reward that the other roles are for simply playing that role. To me, if this works and the queue times are reduced, the only ones that benefit from this change are under geared alts or players that are way behind the curve.<br />
What I don’t really understand is why you think pure dps should be given a chance at a reward. We don't have to get into an argument about what roles have more responsibility, it is simply about the numbers. We chose to play a role that a ton of other people chose to play as well. Incentives like this are to help alleviate shortages of what is needed, and more dps isn’t needed. There is nothing wrong with that. If you have nurses, doctors, and pharmacists all working in a hospital and there is a shortage of nurses, they will offer overtime to those nurses to encourage them to work more. It would be pretty silly for a doctor to claim they deserve a chance to work overtime too just because the nurses can.<br />
<br />
I'm in the exact same shoes as you. I play a mage, I have zero need for JPs and VPs. I don't even run random heroics anymore because the few extra VPs to sell another pair of BoE boots isn't worth the effort in my opinion. I have one alt, who is not 85 and I only use it for JC and AH purposes. So I will never have access to these rewards or even shorter queue times but given everything I just said in the previous sentences about what I play and how I play this game I also don't feel that I should. I'm hopeful that it will help those people who do queue up, and that tanks and sometimes healers will get rewarded for doing something that many of us don't want to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reading the blue post about this, it seems that the drop chance in the bag (for mounts) is identical to the real world drop chance. We know that there are currently 3 mounts being offered (that we know of) so I assume you would get 3 shots with the real world drop chance for each mount when you get a bag.<br />
<br />
So for an example:<br />
Raven Lord has a .01% drop chance (real world drop chance)<br />
White Hawkstrider has a 1% drop chance (real world drop chance)<br />
Baron Rivendare's Deathcharger has a .001% drop chance (real world drop chance)<br />
<br />
You finish a heroic and get your bag. You have the real world drop chance per mount in bag you earn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the best approach to arguing a perceived disparity against DPS in CTA I've seen so far. Well expressed, Asmodius.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I'd have to point out that in choosing to play a pure DPS class as opposed to a hybrid, and regardless of the more subjective but no less real &quot;responsibility&quot; of tanking and healing, you already have a benefit over said hybrids and have had it for as long as the game has been around: No Hybrid Tax (click here (http://www.wowwiki.com/Hybrid_Tax) for further reference). Hybrid classes have bemoaned this design decision, but Blizzard has stuck by its guns. If anyone doubts it still exists, here's (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2325614929) a recent reference to it by Bashiok.<br />
<br />
As a Pure DPS class you have the potential to carry out your role more effectively than any hybrid class doing so. Sure, skill and luck come into play as well, but the statistics show that the Hybrid Tax is not only real; it works: On average, 6/10 top 10 DPS classes are currently Pure DPS, as opposed to Hybrids, with Pure DPS classes grabbing the No. 1 spot over 80% of the times (source (http://stateofdps.com/)). This indicates that, assuming equal skill among all players, and notwithstanding varying fight mechanics and RNG, Pure DPS classes will consistently dish out more damage than Hybrids.<br />
<br />
Like Granyala said above (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2245-Dungeon-Finder-Call-to-Arms-Clarification?p=11012455#comment_11012455), although for different reasons, there has to be a downside to that, and this is a very, very minimal one. Minimal to the point that you can completely negate it for your Pure DPS main via a Tanking/Healing alt, should you choose to.<br />
<br />
Besides, as you said yourself, you don't have much interest in LFD anyway, regardless of the faster queue time that only DPS will greatly benefit from; the reason why CTA is being implemented in the first place, so it makes any perceived disadvantage further moot.</div></div><hr />

A shorter que is by no means even remotely close to additional chances at rare in game mounts. <br />
<br />
I'm not losing anything but for those that have no tanking spec or class. They sure aren't gaining anything.<br />

If they wanted it slightly improved again, then pure DPS classes (Rogues, Hunters, etc) should get a small bonus as well. Not as big, but a little token gift due to their lack of choice. Maybe even just 10% more bonus gold from completing the dungeon.<br />

Hybrid classes have bemoaned this design decision, but Blizzard has stuck by its guns.

<br />
Sure I've been tanking with my paladin since BC, when we had to share gear with warriors because the itemization sucked back then, but its all about learning.<br />
<br />
And I've been out of the game for a year, when I came back, they changed a lot of things on paladin. I was like &quot;Jesus, what happened to tanking now?&quot;<br />
And what did I do? I went through my talents and spellbook and studied all of my talents and skills, just to see how it would be like.<br />
<br />
Then, I started tanking normal dungeons which are pretty easy, and so on.<br />
<br />
Tanking is about learning, people shouldn't fear using pvp gear sometimes, for regulars that is. Back when I could only do regular dungeons like Tol'vir and Grim Batol, I got myself a pvp bracer that upgraded my iLvl so I could go there and get new gear. In no time you'll be using 80% tanking gear and being able to do heroics easily.<br />
<br />
Same thing about healing. When I decided to go healing I had an entire gear of healing, but I had about 3 green items when I first got into a heroic. And I still managed to heal everyone and no one died. Seriously, if you learn your class and talent specs, gear won't be a problem. If you suck at it, its just gonna make you performance even worse.</div></div><hr />

The votekick system is so screwed up now you can barely use the damn thing before it says you can't vote kick anymore. It's not a solution to the problem of hybrids queing as tanks but then going DPS.<br />

mount-SAME DROP AS THE WORLD DROP %<br />
<br />
DPS<br />
sit in que longer (so what play the ah do something else)<br />
ur repair bill is like less then half of a tanks <br />
ur que will become shorter after ____ amount of people swap to tanks to get the bag<br />
if this works out how blizz wants it to dps will end up being the one that gets the bag <br />

<br />
If they wanted it slightly improved again, then pure DPS classes (Rogues, Hunters, etc) should get a small bonus as well. Not as big, but a little token gift due to their lack of choice. Maybe even just 10% more bonus gold from completing the dungeon.<br />
<br />
You do know that you will be getting &quot;reduced queue times&quot; thanks to the DF:CtA, its kind of a bummer for some classes like the one you mentioned above that don't have any additional role choices but following Blizzard steps of addressing some problems this might be a pretty good one and we have to remember that they are doing this in the first place to address the unacceptable queue times DPS are getting on the LFD.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The additional reward for completing the Dungeon Finder Call to Arms (called the Satchel of Exotic Mysteries) will be Bind on Account; able to be freely sent to other characters on your account once you receive it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its a pretty smart move in my op, if the tank already has those mount on his main he probably will be tempted to get them for his alt making the tank population for the dungeons &quot;higher&quot;, but we still gotta see how this all works out on live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh btw grats to the QQers- it's not going to be any better now you're just going to have totally fail tanks and healers - just like it was going to be before it does not change anything really. Its already bad enough out there without the addition of 10 times the amount of bads playing tank and healer classes. <br />
<br />
I'll still be running with my guild on alts that aren't my tank - and tanking for my guild on their alt 5 man runs - there is no substitute for a competent group who can clear GB / HoO (skipping P'tah) in 30 minutes or less- if I que tank in RDF and get GB Im lucky if I get out in an hour, HoO even longer...</div></div><hr />

That means Dps Queue's will be shorter. Based on the number of tanks starting to queue, the tank queue times will go up now. <br />
Basicly: <br />
Dps Queue times lower = Win <br />
Tank Queue times will get a little higher and as a reward for this they will get a BoA bag with reward in it = Win<br />
Rare Mount Drop chance from Bag = Rare Mount drop chance from the dungeons itself = Fair<br />
<br />
The only problem here will be: Tanks that already been playing this game for a long time (geared and experienced) will probably have some of the rare mounts so wont care about Queue'ing for the rewards much. On the other hand Plate Dps - Plate Pvp players will have a motive to queue as Tank for Random heroics with their Pvp/Dps gear and no experience of tanking. <br />
<br />
So The number of Tanks will increase = The average quality of Tanks will decrease = Blizzard has to find a way to stop Tanks entering Random heroics with Pvp gear or Dps gear somehow which will leave it only to Experience of tanks, and experience is earned by time so will be ok (not in all cases but there is always room for exceptions)<br />
<br />
Maybe the Item Level Average system can be modified a little for the Tanks (Like Pvp gear and Dps gear not effecting the Tanking gear item Average - which should have been the case when this system first kicked in anyway, since it is freaking easy for a tank or healer to cheat this system and enter heroics 1 min after they hit 85 with no proper Tank/Healer gear)</div></div><hr />

Nonsense, there's already a fix for this, it's called CC. A well geared tank doesn't need it at this point to be honest, it makes all the difference needed for a poorly geared tank or healer.<br />

If there was you wouldn't be seeing Shadow Priests and Boomkins topping meters on any fights. Pure DPS gets no benefit over hybrid dps.<br />
<br />
It's a joke with regards to Warriors who have always complained of being constantly nerfed in every expansion. It is not a joke with regards to the existence of the tax, whatever form it may currently be taking (e.g. class mechanics, percentile damage reduction, external/internal CDs on abilities, etc.).<br />
<br />
Besides, even if Blizzard actually denies its existence, how can you refute the statistical evidence? Note I also included the statistics in my post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2245-Dungeon-Finder-Call-to-Arms-Clarification?p=11013449#comment_11013449), which you claim is uninformed/made up. Balance druids and shadow priests (and any other particularly well played hybrid class) can top the DPS charts, but they do not do so consistently on the average.<br />
<br />
The fact is you can't refute the statistical evidence. Pure DPS have shown and still show a higher potential to deal damage. And it's a good thing they do, because otherwise, there would be no incentive to play them besides fun mechanics and/or RP, particularly for a min/maxer in a high level raiding environment.<br />
<br />
If you can somehow, logically and convincingly, refute the statistical evidence that substantiates my claim, I'd love to hear it. I will be the first to concede my defeat and retract my statements regarding the Hybrid Tax. Not that it would matter, because I have nothing against it. Moreover, the overarching argument regarding the absence of an actual disadvantage to Pure DPS via CTA, as a result of multiple factors not the least of which is BoA goodie bags, will remain unscathed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If my employer does a random drawing and 50% of employees get $20 and I don't, I have not lost money.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have not complained about a single change through out my entire time playing WoW, so do not assume you know me and call me a pessimist.<br />
<br />
At no point in my post did I say, &quot;Cerebrate is a pessimist.&quot; However, considering your response to my post, I am starting to consider it. At least a little bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is absolutely ZERO positive and plenty of negative in this to me. I do not care about the queue times as I said so what do I gain? There are already so many bad tanks to deal with and now there is going to be way more. Now tanks will get unlimited chances at the mount drops that I only get 1 chance per lockout. To claim any of this is fair is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
and herein lies the problem. World of Warcraft was and is not designed for Cerebrate. There are millions of people who play this game. Just because you don't care about queue times dosen't change the fact that this is intended to sharten those times for DPS, which is a good thing. Plus, for people willing to tank or heal in randoms their is now a little extra incentive. Also good.<br />
<br />
How is this not fair? It's obvious that people are, for some reason, reluctant to heal or tank randoms. This is a little extra incentive to offset that reluctance. I would agree it's not equal, but as a wise person once helped me to see, fair isn't always equal and equal isn't always fair.<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, this is a pretty minor thing. if you are a DPSer (like me! =)) That was farming for some of these mounts, nothing really changes for you. Maybe you have a healer or tank alt that you might be tempted to run some randoms on now. If so, mission accomplished. If not, no biggie!</div></div><hr />

It doesn't screw you over at all... At the moment you have long ques and no additional bonuses. With this change you will have shorter ques and probably no additional bonuses. What exactly are you losing with this change ?<br />
<br />
If it really bothers you though perhaps you could try leveling 1 of the 6 classes that do have a tanking or healing spec.... If you don't want to do that and you really want the mounts then go farm them solo.... it's easy. This is the only realistic way they are going to reduce the ques so be happy that you will now get faster dungeon ques.</div></div><hr />

Bad analogy. I understand what you are trying to say, but it is more along the lines of, &quot;Middle managers will get bonuses every day for showing up to work. This will help the workers get their work done faster.&quot;<br />

The workers should rejoice as their work gets done faster, but you can also understand some resentment from the workers if middle managers get a bonus simply for showing up to work.</div></div><hr />

Consider it a reward for those people playing tanks and healers for taking on extra responsibility then... it's them who always get the blame when something goes wrong and now they will get a tiny bonus for it.

Actually you are the one that is not making sense, entering as Tank with pvp gear = fail. Pvp gear has healing stats / Pvp gear has Dps stats. But pvp gear doesnt have Tanking stats. Just Stamina and a little bit of mastery on it. It is against the way of game.<br />
Can a full Pvp geared, tank speced person tank a heroic? Yes it can be done.<br />
What are the chances of fail? Much higher than the same person geared with Pve Tanking gear.<br />

Is it just me that has read it as you get the mount that drops from that specific instance.So a selection of them arent obtainable from Call of Arms. If not its far easier to solo instances than do the Call of Arms to get a small chance of that mount you are after(where you get a wave of repeat mounts..yes the 6th raven lord when you are after the strat mount is so much help), i hit instance cap for stratholme faster than it takes to do a HC.<br />
<br />
This really isn't going to make it intresting for me to get tank/healer offspec or use my alts more than the one time. Would still rather run with guildies and be done in 20 minutes with no bitching than do Call of Arms.<br />
<br />
You will just get a wave of idiot tanks and have a longer instance..shave 5 minutes of the timer and have a run that take 15minutes longer (and get stuck with one since abuse of vote kick)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's true but I think that those people are fairly rare. I love my Rogue and my Mage but in the end with the BoA bags I think this is the best compromise blizz could make in terms of giving DPS characters a shot at the bags. <br />
<br />
Now all they need to do is let you queue with at least 2 people and still get the CTA rewards. Tanks/healers solo queuing means those 1-3 dps that used to not have to wait in queues with the help of their friends now are added to the pool of DPS waiting on dungeons. This might effectively keep the wait time the same... Besides you'll burn out on bad groups slower with a friend there to complain to.</div></div><hr />

We are not talking about the history of the game, we are talking about the first 4 months of this expansion.

<br />
I play a warlock as my main, and I never, ever queue without a tank or healer friend, simply because the queue times are too long. Now that I am done with heroic 5man content, this change has zero effect on me when I want to play my warlock. It will however, tempt me to jump in and do a heroic or two on my warrior every now and then, and I am guessing this is what blizzard was after.<br />
<br />
I'm going to be a bit extreme here and guess that the people who complain about this either had no brothers or sisters when growing up, or were just plain spoiled. Having 3 siblings myself, I got to understand that even if my brother would get something, it did not mean I lost something. Do you see the comparison I am trying to make? Just because they give tanks a reward, does not mean that DPS are getting punished. On the contrary, DPS are actually getting a reward too, but in a different form. If they want to do a heroic, they don't have to wait 40 minutes or so. As for me, like I stated before, it will have zero effect on me, but looking at it through someone who is trying to do heroics perspective, I see this as a great change.<br />

<br />
As nice as that would be, I disagree it should be implemented, if anything, for the fact that a solo queuing tank or healer will always get paired with 4 other people off the queue. This makes CTA queuers help clear the queue in the most efficient way possible every single time. Given that this is the purpose of CTA, I understand changing the solo queueing requirement would be counter-productive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If DPS has the least amount of responsibility, it is not their fault. It's all Blizzard's. It's bad design then. A good DPS can also tip the balance. You get nowhere with just a healer or a tank - or you're not supposed to. That dungeons are getting there is, again, not the DPS'ers' fault.<br />
<br />
A few points to consider:<br />
People get frustrated and downright vicious if clearing a dungeon takes too long - DPS'ers responsibility.<br />
Only good DPS can help/save you if your healer and/or tank is undergeared.<br />
<br />
In a scenario where no one is geared over the enemies they're fighting, each role is equally important. In time this changes, to that I agree. But that's a problem that should not be solved by tossing goodie bags after the most needed roles. The dungeon tool in itself is already a huge help. If people are not satisfied with it, they should team up with friends.<br />
I really, really dislike how the dungeon tool now becomes a means to farm rare mounts for certain roles. Yes, everyone can roll a tank or a healer and mail it to a main - but come on. Where is this game going if that is how the designers think?</div></div><hr />

The workers should rejoice as their work gets done faster, but you can also understand some resentment from the workers if middle managers get a bonus simply for showing up to work.<br />
<br />
Well, you're trying to make a direct analogy for Call to Arms and I would argue that yours still isn't perfect. Mine was a more general one to make the point that you must first posses something before you can lose it. Blizzard isn't stealing something from DPSers and their situation is in no way worse than it was before CtA. Being upset over someone else gaining something you did not is just a waste of energy.<br />
<br />
Back to you analogy, though. I LOVE analogies!! I would say that this would be closer to CtA.<br />

I don't understand how this is a major improvement ... unless I am the only 85 that doesn't have a level 85 tank alt. <br />
I think you've missed the point of the new feature entirely. The feature wasn't designed to give everyone a chance on getting a mount, it's to reduce DPS/Healer queue times by giving Tanks an extra incentive.<br />
<br />
The change actually benefits everyone. Tanks get a couple of nice little rewards while DPS and Healers get shorter queue times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And after a few weeks when the novelty wears off the &quot;pullers&quot; would mostly stop queuing and we'd get Call to Arms:Pullers instead. Besides this role technically already exists with the Dungeon Guide fuctionality, it just rarely comes into play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So many times I've seen at a lower level tanks queue, try there hardest, and be COMPLETELY b*tched out, say F this, and leave. If you people(the DPS) would for two seconds think about something other than your numbers, I bet your queue time would be way shorter. I basically only tank and only for at least 4/5 guildy's in a group. This game seems to be the only one where that's an issue, I would guess do to the LFD system's.

<br />
More like Blizzard-sponsored queue time reduction. It would be carrying if they only offered it to the best geared, most successful tanks and healers, but this goes out to the role in general. So you'll get the good and the bad, hence no &quot;carrying&quot; of anyone. The group might end up dragging a bad tank or healer for all you know.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean if bliz started awarding more honor to players in the 2200 range for carrying 1000 range player upto 1700 or whatever so they qualified for better gear, how would that go over?<br />
<br />
Completely different case. There is no win-win in that scenario, especially for the PvP community at large, since it rewards mediocrity (find a group to carry you) and a distortion of the ladders in terms of how effectively they represent individual and team competitiveness/skill (a player would be carried to a high Personal Rating far more often than they may be getting carried now).<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't seem to grasp how much it sucks to heal or tank pug heroics.<br />

Maybe he can't grasp it because it doesn't suck. It may suck to you, but I particularly enjoy both tanking and healing far more than DPS. I'm sure others coincide with me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imo they should have made it soulbound. give tanks and healers a benefit. if ppl want to get the extra benefits, get a tank or heal offset and gear it.<br />

Can a full Pvp geared, tank speced person tank a heroic? Yes it can be done.<br />
What are the chances of fail? Much higher than the same person geared with Pve Tanking gear.<br />
Why is there a hit cap and why is it the most important stat for all classes until capped? = To decrease the chances of fail and cuz it is meant to be (Same Logic)<br />
<br />
Depends how good the pvp gear is. If its the top-end 365 stuff then its probably almost as good if not better for tanking compared to the 333 gear the heroics WERE ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO BE DONE IN.

If they wanted it slightly improved again, then pure DPS classes (Rogues, Hunters, etc) should get a small bonus as well. Not as big, but a little token gift due to their lack of choice. Maybe even just 10% more bonus gold from completing the dungeon.<br />
<br />
You already get gold and VP for completing a dungeon. Why exactly should you get a reward for this new system whose goal is to reduce queues for DPS classes?.... oh wait.. you get reduced queue times.. THERE IS YOUR REWARD.<br />
<br />
My God, people are just so selfish.... I want.. I want... just a small reward.. please.. I want. DPS is easier, which is why you have a queue, which is why Blizzard needs to bribe guild tanks like myself to PUG you guys so you don´t have 45 min queues anymore. If they start offering ´little token gifts´ to people who DPS.. then I will queue as a dps instead and make your queue much longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, people who run heroics are usually PvE players, and their objective is to be ready for raid. Once they are raid equipped, they don't do heroic anymore, out of the daily random hero for VP farming.<br />
<br />
So, the problem is that the population of PvE players, in the end, tend to adact to raid positioning.<br />
<br />
So if in a 25man raid we have 2 tank slots, 5 to 7 healer slots and dps to fill, I won't level a tank as a main if i don't have possibility to play my role.<br />
<br />
So, the problem is that the proportion of tank and healers in raid are lower than in 10 man or worst in 5 man<br />
<br />
To have potentially no queue, there is to be IN GENERAL more need of tank and healer.<br />
<br />
I know this is a provocation, but if in 5 man the proportion tank-dps-healer is 1-3-1, in 10 man it should be 2-6-2- and in 25 man 5-15-5.<br />
<br />
said, I have a prot-paladin, but i don't think I will chain-queue for this...cause I don't see why lose my time when i don't enjoy to do this.</div></div><hr />

We already have people with almost no clue on tanking taking fast queue times and taking dps gear because that's what they main as. Now we're going to have everyone and their mom tanking in order to get rare mounts/free extra rewards in general. Sure we'll see slightly fast queue times for dps (I honestly can't say the times will fall below 15 mins) just to be thrown in to the mix with a high population of people who have never tanked before. I'm not bashing people who seriously want to tank and are trying to learn, more power to you, it's just that there is going to be such a high consistency of it. All that's going to happen is more complaining.<br />
<br />
This will probably happen a lot the first week, then they will give up. Remember, the bag of goodies is only given AFTER the last boss dies. Really bad tanks will never make it though the dungeon, so will never get the reward. A few times of wiping and getting cursed at with no reward, and they will realize it is easier to just farm these rare mounts. Yeah, it will probably suck the first week until they figure it out though and stop queueing.<br />
<br />
I honestly think you will also see a lot more guild tanks (people who only tank for guild runs) will now be doing full random PUGs. I am to the point with my gear where I can handle dragging along some bad dps.. for the first few months, it wasn´t worth it.</div></div><hr />

The only downside I see to this is that just as it was an occasional problem with LFD's introduction, there may be an influx of undergeared/clueless tanks and/or DPS masquerading as tanks trying to cash in on the rewards by accepting the role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, people who run heroics are usually PvE players, and their objective is to be ready for raid. Once they are raid equipped, they don't do heroic anymore, out of the daily random hero for VP farming.<br />
So, the problem is that the population of PvE players, in the end, tend to adact to raid positioning.<br />
So if in a 25man raid we have 2 tank slots, 5 to 7 healer slots and dps to fill, I won't level a tank as a main if i don't have possibility to play my role.<br />
So, the problem is that the proportion of tank and healers in raid are lower than in 10 man or worst in 5 man<br />
<br />
<br />
I take your point about 25 man raidgroups, but from what I can see on my server atleast they are becoming a minority as guilds lose members and move to 10 man raiding only, which happens to have exactly the same tank:dps ratio as 5 mans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Running stratholme, or any other dungeon that drops a mount for that matter, will be alot faster than tanking a full heroic. So its still better to just go do the dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Tanks/Healers have to SOLO queue meaning less guild groups, meaning MORE dps in the queue. The time will hardly change from the 40+ minutes it usually is.<br />
<br />
You are missing the point that most tanks will now run more dungeons per week. I will still probably run the 7 troll dungeons per week to cap VP with my guild, but I will also do more random dungeons for some pets ( being a druid, the vanity pets are more important to me than mounts I never use)</div></div><hr />

It would be carrying if they only offered it to the best geared, most successful tanks and healers, but this goes out to the role in general. So you'll get the good and the bad, hence no &quot;carrying&quot; of anyone. The group might end up dragging a bad tank or healer for all you know.<br />
<br />
We are talking about LFD here, in a group comprised of 5 pugs, 60% will not be good. Granted there will be the occasional group where 100% will be good. But there will also be times when 0% are good. Coupled with the fact that you _must_ queue alone means that you won't even have a safety net if you are tank/heal of bringing a tank/heal with you. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Completely different case. There is no win-win in that scenario, especially for the PvP community at large, since it rewards mediocrity (find a group to carry you) and a distortion of the ladders in terms of how effectively they represent individual and team competitiveness/skill (a player would be carried to a high Personal Rating far more often than they may be getting carried now).<br />
<br />
&quot;This system is meant to address the unacceptable queue times currently being experienced by those that queue for the DPS role at max level. The long queue times are, of course, caused by a very simple lack of representation in the Dungeon Finder by tanks, and to some extent healers. We don't feel the tanking and healing roles have any inherent issues that are causing the representation disparity, except that fulfilling them carries more responsibility. Understandably, players prefer to take on that responsibility in more organized situations than what the Dungeon Finder offers, but perhaps we can bribe them a little. While this system gives tanks and healers something extra, the incentive is being provided so that we can help players in the DPS role get into more dungeons, get better gear, and continue progressing.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you can see the intent is to help DPS get better gear and continue &quot;progressing&quot;. This always bugs me ... if your intent is only to run heroics, what exactly are you progressing towards? pugging raids? if making pugging raids more accessible is the goal, why do we have guilds again? <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe he can't grasp it because it doesn't suck. It may suck to you, but I particularly enjoy both tanking and healing far more than DPS. I'm sure others coincide with me.<br />
<br />
others who spend their weekends chained to a wall with a ball gag in their mouths probably agree with you. I guess i just cant rationalize spending that much time being frustrated, but then that doesn't jive with my desire to play golf ... i guess i am just as confused as bliz is when it comes to knowing what i want.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koloss</div><div class="date">2011-04-08, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this feature is fully illogical.<br />
Let's take a DK for instance, who dedicated himself as being DD raider and playing PvP (of course not on Blood talent). How would this thing effect him? Why would he/anyone just reroll on tank, because of this feature?<br />
And I see people asking: &quot;Ohh, deathcharger, how many runs was it?&quot; &quot;0, i just did dungeons&quot;, because running the 7 dungeons weekly for example will actually &quot;grant&quot; a mount, and pets after a while. <br />
My main is a lock, and I have a tank alt, what I love too, so we could say that it will affect me and my main well, but I don't like it though.<br />
I'm not crying I'm just saying that it will not effect queue times (maybe about 2 minutes), and it will only give a present for tanks, who were tanks before this feature or from the beggining. Those are the cryers, who are QQing about long wait times, which is not because of the system. Like someone said, if you want shorter queue, bring a friend or a guildie. I say leave this idea, nobody will end the game, because of long waiting times, if anyone cares about my opinion.:P</div></div><hr />

Its only good if most of the people that say they are going to start tanking, are not completely shitty players that just want a free mount. Wich as anyone (exceept the bads) knows, will happen. Its obvious that 90% of the new tanks will be complete crap and have no idea how to tank or play their class / spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some rare mounts drop from heroic instances that can only be run once a day. And chain-running Stratholme is BORING. Heroic pug runs will provide me with some funny stories, to say the least.</div></div><hr />

Everybody whining over their roles, saying how stupid each of the other roles are. There was a time when you made your own 5 man groups, from inside or outside your guild, and you knew these players or got to know them over time. <br />
<br />
Now, 5 random people are thrown together and expected to know everything. If you don't, you get instantly ridiculed or worse. Since it's likely you'll never play with these random people again, asshatery reigns supreme. No one gives a crap on how they treat the other players or how they play the game. So you get tanks that run the group however they want, healers that let dps die, and dps that doesn't care if they are standing in the fire or not. So who is to blame? The players for failing, or Blizz for trying to force random people playing together?<br />
<br />
The LFD tool is failing and quickly but Blizz will never remove it now. Instead they are trying to bribe the tanks into using it more, trying to make us buy into the system. I won't. I still won't q without at least a few guildy's so we get the guild xp. If I can't, then I won't run. Who cares about flasks, pets, or mounts. I have that stuff already or can get it easily in other ways.<br />
<br />
People remininsce about WoW back in classic and BC saying how good the game was. Fundamentally, I don't think its changed that much. Its still a good game. What drastically has changed is WHO you play with. Before I always knew the other four people in my group, probably considered them friends, and didn't act like an ass. Now, if I do random, I instantly judge people, incorrectly most likely, and complain how bad they are. I get sucked into the same trap. It's no wonder everybody says everyone else is fail. So, I refrain as much as possible from doing randoms. <br />
<br />
Why doesn't Blizz award players more for running with their guild? To me, that makes more sense. That way everyone can earn flasks, pets, etc... instead of just the tanks (my main is a tank, and the call to arms system is stupidly unfair imo). I like WoW, I will keep playing for long time I think. But the LFD tool has not helped the game at all in the long run and in some ways it might even be a hindrance. I would favor removing it altogether but I imagine there would be just as much qq'ing over that as well.</div></div><hr />
