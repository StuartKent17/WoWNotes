always quite fun to do solo hard content where people can watch and cheer you on<br />
was super fun and we all got smashed.</div></div><hr />

The whole point is to be a comunity event where everyone can watch the fight and as you fight peopel watch and judge you. Phasing this would make it boring as all fuck.</div></div><hr />

tbh it was more because of the absolutely absurd powerscaling than anything else<br />

Sadly the powerscaling is even stronger in BfA</div></div><hr />

Mop was faceroll as well. Only boss that require your attention was the spinning hex something boss. That took like 5-10 tries until i realized i was doing it wrong...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It could be, but I had HC(myth) gear from SoO and the bosses were still challenging.<br />
In WoD and Legion, I'v over-ilvled it. In legion, I'v cut through the bosses like butter and I didn't even have Mythic gear ilvl ...<br />
Bosses like Hexos, the venomous snake and the last boss were hard during the whole expansion.<br />
<br />
In WoD and Legion I didn't even think about boss mechanics as I was cleaving the bosses one by one...</div></div><hr />

I only ever purchased the invitation in MoP from the Black Market. Never had to purchase another again and was able to access Brawler's in all seasons on all characters. When was this any different?</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure you can get bruce as a mount. Unless they changed their mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Boring, more rehashed content.<br />
<br />
so are raids, pvp seasons or m+.<br />
do you see people complaing about how the new raid uses the same concept of bosses having hitpoints that need to be reduced to 0? the same rehashed mechanic that is older than the game itself? <br />
small hint: some people like certain stuff coming back because it is similar to what they know and like. some would argue that NOT rehashing enough made the game bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this for all specs or is it for fotm like all other content? :)<br />
<br />
you either don't know the Brawler's guild and did not bother to read it up, or you are just shitposting for fun and giggles.<br />
while there are some rare occasions where certain classes are needed, like very high m+ or undergeared mythic raiding, it can hardly be called &quot;all content&quot;, so hyperbole much?<br />
<br />
<br />
This might as well be patch 8.4 content because while I'm sure it'll be possible to complete all the fights this patch they never scale them with ilvl so it's always infinitely easier at the end of the expansion.<br />
<br />
i personally like this style of pacing.<br />
give the good people time to show that they are good, and each patch more people manage to beat the later fights.<br />
nothing better than trying to beat rank 3 or 4 boss as a casual player while watching the other guy to try the rank 8 boss for the 10th time in a row.<br />
also gives the good people the chance to do fun stuff like testing how fast they can blow up fights.<br />
i sure remember blowing up that stupid poison-snake in a few seconds in better gear after struggling with it for quite some time.</div></div><hr />
